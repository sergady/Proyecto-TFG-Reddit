A further 10.2 percent to 15.7 percent reported having had more than one thousand lifetime sexual partners.[14]\n\n\u00b7 A survey conducted by the homosexual magazine Genre found that 24 percent of the respondents said they had had more than one hundred sexual partners in their lifetime. The magazine noted that several respondents suggested including a category of those who had more than one thousand sexual partners.[15]\n\nsource with more info and charts: http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/1117942/posts",

I feel awful for thinking this stuff, because I deeply respect visible and proud queer people, I actually wish I could be half as brave as they are.\nI can't bring myself to come out to most people (only a handful of close friends know) because of a lot of reasons.\nBecause I'm afraid straight girls would act differently towards me and they would treat me like I'm a guy who just wants to get into their pants or watch them undress to look at their boobs.\nAnd even if it wouldn't make any sense, because I'm nothing like a man, I just feel like they would have the right to think of me like this.\nI don't want people to look at me and judge me and think \"she's a lesbian\".\nI don't want guys to fetishize me and I don't want them to make sexual remarks.\nI don't want it to be a big deal especially because I've known the people I'm around everyday for a really long time and they would be shocked if I were to come out, meaning they would be talking about it behind my back or to my face and I just don't feel like I can take it right now.\nAll of this makes me feel depressed and even guiltier since I really do want to feel proud, only my mind won't let me. I can't control my intrusive thoughts. I don't know how to overcome this fear of coming out, I'm so exhausted of being in the closet, but I feel safe in it.",

I lived two hours away in a pleasant town in the country and was really happy with my current situation,  however the distance was getting hard so I was the one who decided to quit my job, leave my home and take a new job a couple hours south and move into his house.\n\nA week ago I read some messages between my fiance and his friend saying some really awful things about me.   Things like calling me a c\\*\\*\\*, b\\*\\*\\*, I shouldn't be upset about moving and that's the way it should be etc.   There were also screenshots from when I confided in my fiance about how upset I was about leaving my hometown and how I was struggling getting used to the new house.    He sent them to his friend and they were laughing at me and calling me a child for being upset about this MAJOR change in my life.    I'd also like to point out that I moved from a town of 1100 people, to a city that is 2 hours away from my friends and family and is a very busy city.   \n\nMy fiance did nothing to stop his friends behaviour.    It continued for months.   I called him out on it after dwelling for a few hours and my fiance see's nothing wrong with the situation.   He plans to continue being friends with this friend of his after all the problems it has caused and how hurt it made me.   Am I wrong to consider ending the relationship after realizing that my fiance clearly doesn't have the respect for me that I thought he did?\n\nHe and his friend just started a business together.   It hasn't generated any income thus far, but he claims this is the reason that the his friendship must go on.    The business is being run out of our house and I can't even go home after work to relax since his friend is lingering around.    My fiance doesn't even have the decency to set boundaries with working hours.   This guy hangs out till 11pm or later at night, and I have to stay at a friends and wait for him to leave before going home.   Keep in mind that my friends live almost 2 hours away.   I have to drive such a far distance to be able to relax after work and I can't even come home at a decent time or this guy will be there.\n\nKeep in mind, my fiance has put 5 thousand dollars into this business.   Yet, his friend hasn't paid him any money yet and there has been no investment return on anything.   I've pointed out that maybe this should be a red flag with his business partner but he completely writes off my opinion. \n\nAm I wrong for being upset?  I feel like this is a red flag.",

We\u2019ve been great friends for the last 3 years and have had a crush on each other for a while before before dating. In high school, our relationship was amazing. We hung out, texted all the time, everything. Summer rolls along and because of vacations we couldn\u2019t see each other much so only hung out once before college. Little bummed but it\u2019s all good everything was still dandy. Then college hits and everything started to change. \nSo Angela is naturally an introvert and I\u2019m naturally an extrovert. I want to hang out with her about once a week (not anything much just like a nice meal in the dining halls together) but she doesn\u2019t seem to want to do much. She no longer initiates conversation anymore, often doesn\u2019t text for hours at a time (despite her being on her phone) and whenever I ask to hang out she doesn\u2019t want to. I know the transition to college has been hard for her and I want to support her but at the same time, I want to keep our relationship going and at least talk. She seems so much happier when she\u2019s around her girlfriends than around me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I really care about her and wish I could help her with her transition but she seems to not ask for it and I kinda feel tossed aside. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not cheating on me because she\u2019s not hanging around with other guys and just hanging around people when she visits home every weekend.  What should I do?\n\nTL;DR girlfriend and I went to college and she slowly is starting to talk with me less and doesn\u2019t seem to want to initiate nor engage in conversation/interactions with me.",

Last minuet he decided he didn't want to come and spend time with his kids like he said he would... This whole time he's been lying to me saying he would show up. I called his parents, and they told me they never knew he was supposed to be coming into town... I'm fucking livid. It's not like something came up he just strung me along and made me look like an idiot in front of my boss.\n\nI'm tired of him lying to me. I'm tired of it. How am I supposed to Coparent with somebody who seems to enjoy treating me like garbage.... I can't stand it anymore.\n\nWhat should I do? Any advice on how to handle somebody who behaves like this? I just can't take it anymore, and I've basically been told there is nothing legally I can do. It's such fucking bullshit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR My ex husband is an immature pile of garbage that I need advice on how to handle.",

  "self_text": "Good afternoon. I had a thought running throughout the day while I was at work. It was partly dealing with an earlier post I made on here and partly one I commented on yesterday. A while back, I asked here something about if it was normal for me, a male, to desire to have female parts. However, I have been doing a little bit of thinking lately and, now that I think of it, I am also relatively comfortable with my male parts as well. (I probably should\u2019ve said something about that there as well. My bad.) Now this is the part where I would probably just make it out to be me just having a moment. But lately, I have been feeling a bit of a weird mixture between me feeling comfortable with being a male and having masculine pronouns, (E.G. he, him, his, etc.) me feeling a little bit feminine, as well as me being somewhat apathetic to the idea of gender. Like, a sort of attitude that says \u201cAs long as I\u2019m happy with myself, I don\u2019t really care what gender I am.\u201d or something similar. (Actually, I want to say that sort of thing might have been going on before recently, but I don\u2019t remember.) Now, I want to ask: does this sound at least slightly demigender? If not, how do people find out they are demigender? I am curious and also a tiny bit nervous as I haven\u2019t really questioned my gender at all.",

  "self_text": "After being away from therapy for a year bc my mom didn't want me going anymore and didn't want to pay $100/session,  (understandable tbh) I'm thinking of going back to the therapist I was seeing. You can look in my post history for the whole story, but basically, I want to do some preventative therapy once a month bc of stuff I went through in the past. AKA I don't want to have a fucking breakdown in my senior year of hs. I was originally gonna wait for once I got to college, since it'll be easier bc 1) I'll be 18 2) I'll have a job and 3) not have to go behind my parents back. But honestly idk if I'll make it til then. So here's my current plan:\n\n1) Try to get a part time job at Publix or something so I have a somewhat steady income. I mentioned it to my mom today and tbh she'll probably let me bc I have a car, finished my college apps, and I'm pulling A's in my classes atm. To get some money quick, I'm thinking of selling some of the books I don't read anymore. \n\n2) Email my therapist and basically ask her if she'll take pity on me and let me pay $50 a session instead of $100 a session. This might not work and I'd be willing to pay $100 a session, but I just don't want my parents questioning why so much money is missing from my account per month. \n\n3) Schedule sessions on the days I have dual enrollment classes (T/Th mornings). That way, after class I can just haul 15 minutes away to her office and back after the session, then come back home under the guise that I was studying at the library. It's a bit of a shaky plan, but it's the best option I have rn. It'd be way more suspicious if I left the house for seemingly no reason during the schoolweek for 1.5 hours. \n\n4) Only go to therapy one or two times a month. One would probably be better just for the sake of less suspicion. I'd prefer two but I'm not trying to get caught. \n\nThere are only two other options that are viable besides my current plan. The first one I see is telling my dad that I want therapy and that I'm willing to get a job to pay for it. Honestly though, there's really no reason for that other than convincing him to cover for me if something goes awry. He's way more supportive then my mom tho, so it might be worth it. The second option is waltzing over to the LGBT resource center at the university I'm dual enrolled at and asking them if they'd be able to give me any kind of help. Again, idk how well that'll work bc I'm not a \"full\" student. I'm just hoping they'll take pity on me at this point. \n\nThat was pretty long but has anyone been in a similar situation and pulled off the secret therapy thing? I'd appreciate any advice or tips.",

This summer i toured Europe alone for several weeks and realized she was the cause of lots of my unhappiness and toxic behavior and decided to go low contact even though we lived together due to me taking the semester off. She took me out to eat and talked about herself and I blew up and got upset (since I had just gotten back from a European tour and she never asked me about it). I \u201capologized\u201d and we went out again she asked me point blank why I was so distant. I made the foolish error of telling her that I felt her behavior was problematic, manipulative and narcissistic and she blew up and began screaming at me called me ungrateful and a loser. She kept yelling and yelling and I hid in my room. I finally confronted her and eventually had to push her away because she got too close and we both sustained light injuries from falling. Now she\u2019s saying I \u201cbeat\u201d her and verbally abusing me via text and email. After a lot of insults about how I\u2019m a college dropout and a failure I told her I was moving out and gonna take up part-time work to support myself and continue my music. Since then she has been trying to make deals with me, telling me if I sign a contract she will pay for my schooling and other expenses and that she is worried for me. She doesn\u2019t really hate me or want me gone but makes my life miserable every day, what do I do? If I leave I can never come back and risk financial ruin as well as throwing away a chance at a bachelors degree (not terribly valuable but still) but if I stay I\u2019m not sure how much more emotional abuse I can take and being the abuser she is she knows how to push my buttons. It\u2019s a tough call and I\u2019m at a loss :(",

  "author": "_thortoise_",
  "self_text": "Posting under a new account, on mobile and I apologise for any formatting errors. Lots of details, tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nA few months back, my parents decided to plan this family outing but they were murky on the details and originally just wanted to reserve the day. The majority of our family activities are planned in advance, I have an older and younger sister and we all have kids and spouses so it takes planning to coordinate all of us. We even drive (in separate cars) together in case someone has car issues and have designated meeting places if we need to stop for a meal or something. This outing was a \"we're going to do something but we don't know what just yet\" kinda thing which is unusual but also not the first time that we have done something like that.\n\nNothing was mentioned in the days prior but we were supposed to meet at my parent's house that morning so I thought that we'd get the details then. We get to my parents', all the kids were running around like lunatics and everyone was rushing about trying to make sure everything was loaded and ready to go.\n\nI asked my dad what the plan was and he said he didn't know what we were doing, he was just there to chauffeur. \n\nI asked my younger sister, she said she thinks we're going to this popular nature centre about an hour away, with a heavy emphasis on \"thinks\".\n\nMy older sister and BIL had other obligations but they let their two youngest stay with our parents, so I had exhausted all the adults to ask except my mom and that's right about the time our youngest went off the trolley. I was trying to calm him down but he was set on throwing tantrums over everything. Change nappy? Tantrum. Shoes? Tantrum. Wrong sippy cup? Tantrum. Banana? Tantrum. Throw unwanted banana in the bin? Tantrum.\n\nMy mom must have slipped outside at some point because when Tropical Storm Toddler moved in, I was so focused on him that I didn't notice what anyone else was doing.\n\nOnce I got our little one calmed down, I noticed that the house was very quiet. I called out for everyone but my wife was the only one who answered. I looked out in the driveway and there were no cars. I asked my wife if anyone said anything to her before they left, they hadn't and she didn't notice either because she had went upstairs to use the bathroom. My family had just left without a word to either of us. I checked my phone and hadn't received a text or call. We were both shocked that they would leave without us but since the whole day had felt weirdly tense, we thought maybe they really didn't want us to go and LO's epic meltdown just solidified that.\n\nMy mom is incredibly passive agressive so I kinda got the vibe that they were being vague on purpose to begin with but being left, I felt, sent a pretty clear signal. I took a moment to digest everything but no matter how I looked at it, them leaving without us felt very deliberate. My wife and I discussed the situation and since we had been hyping up our kids about this family fun day, we decided that it would probably be best to just keep to ourselves and bypass anymore of the passive agressive BS.\n\nThen an hour and a half later, my family started asking when we were going to be joining them at the nature centre. I was honest and said that we didn't really feel included as we weren't even sure if that is where they were going so we just decided to do something else instead. \n\nMy younger sister got super hacked and accused me of being unappreciative of all our mom's hard work to plan this outing. She kept saying how this is such a \"middle child attention grab\" and that everyone knew exactly where we were going and what we were doing, even our older sister who didn't go. I tried to explain our perspective of the situation but she did not want to hear it and kept focusing on how this was disrespectful to our parents. \n\nI finally just told her that I hoped they all had a good time but we wouldn't be joining them today. \n\nMy younger sister and mom haven't spoken to me since, that was nearly 4 months ago. I just don't understand why they got so upset over a trip to some nature centre and dinner at a chain restaurant. I'm not upset, we had a grand day with our children. \n\nI'm not close with my younger sister so that is not really an issue. She is mom's golden child, I'm accustomed to her throwing fits and never having to take responsibility for her words or actions. We are cordial at our obligatory family functions and that is fine by me.\n\nWhat I don't understand is how my mom is acting. She claims she is not upset or ignoring me BUT she goes out of her way to not interact with me, like having my dad call to ask me a question, sending him to our house to drop something off, calling my wife to ask questions about our children (which she never did before) and even having some of my nieces/nephews call from her phone to say ask me something or pass along a message. My mom and I used to chat multiple times a week, sometimes even multiple times a day and now, nothing. \n\nSo I took a knee a couple weeks into all of this and text my mom that I did not like how things were between us and that we needed to get together and sort it out, she did not respond. \n\nA few days ago, my cousin overheard a conversation between her mom and mine where my mom was again saying that I am the one not speaking to her and she has no idea why or what my problem is but she just wants to put this all behind us whenever I am ready to talk to her again. \n\nThis is the first time that my mom has acted like this with me but it is also the first time that I have disrupted her plans. I normally just go along with whatever she wants but my wife and I have recently decided that our family needs to be our priority. While we love my parents and hers', we are tired of turning ourselves inside out to accommodate everyone else. Last Xmas, we had multiple dinners we were expected to attend. We were in the car for close to 3 hours total, it was miserable and we vowed to never do that to our children again.\n\nMy dad is completely brassed off and offered me a portion of his shareholder distribution bonus (I work for his company) if I will just fix things with my mom. It would be a substantial amount and we could use the padding but I hate that he thinks money will solve this.\n\nI just don't see how anything can be resolved if my mom won't even admit that she was/is upset. I would really like to be able to discuss this like rational adults, walk away with an understanding of each other's perspective and feel like this issue has been resolved but judging from my mom's current behavior, I'm not sure she's capable of that.\n\nWas I the arse in this situation? Is this because I'm starting to enforce my boundaries? I've already reached out once with no luck, should I try a face to face? Any advice/insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\n\ntl;dr: My family planned a day trip but left without giving us the details of where to go so we decided not to join. Sister and mom are now ignoring me. I reached out to mom but she claims that I'm the one ignoring her. Need advice.",

  "author": "connfusionthrowRA",
  "self_text": "Hello! I\u2019m (28F) and my best friend, let\u2019s call him Jim for ease, is (27M). We have been best friends for 8+ years, and have lived together in and off (mostly in the same bedroom, despite having our own spaces) for the last 5 years. I currently live with Jim and his family. \n\nJim is gay. I am bisexual. We met the first day of college and have been consistently friends since then. Our junior year, Jim lost his mom during the fall semester. Right after spring semester, I lost my dad. Our friendship became extremely tight knit after that, to the point that we would spend most of our days together, or texting, or interacting on each other\u2019s social media. After college, I moved into a shared house with a couple of other people, and not too long after that Jim started coming over all the time and spending the night. I moved into an apartment after that, as did he, but eventually he would end up staying in my apartment with me and sleeping over. After that, we moved into another shared house together, which soon devolved to him spending most of his time in my room/sleeping in my room. He eventually moved home to be closer to his family, and not too long after that I ended up moving in with them (at his suggestion). We have worked at the same places of employment for pretty much all of this \u201cliving together but not living together\u201d phase, although finally we currently do not work at the same job. \n\nWe talk about EVERYTHING together. Life, our childhoods, sexual encounters, dirty secrets, stuff we\u2019re ashamed of. Everything. The times that I have tried to initiate conversation with him about \u201cus\u201d have always led to \u201cwe\u2019re not in a relationship so stop talking about it\u201d, and he wouldn\u2019t even call me his best friend until about a year ago. Jim can acknowledge that we are close, and that sometimes the things we say and do for each other could even be considered as \u201ccodependent\u201d, but are actually many things a couple would do normally. We made out once, about two years ago, but aside from \u201cthat was cool\u201d, we\u2019ve never really talked about it in depth. \n\nI\u2019ve definitely had feelings for him in the past, and have tried to talk to him about it. I\u2019m usually met with a few weeks of silence. We\u2019ve tried the whole \u201clet\u2019s give each other space\u201d thing tons of different times, but every single time it devolves to us spending all of our time together.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker, though. None of this is initiated by me. He says he wants space, I barely try to contact him. He says we\u2019re \u201ctoo close\u201d, I back away and try not to ask him for anything/share anything. He says we spend too much time together, and three days later he\u2019s the one asking to sleep in my bed with me. \n\nHe says how close we are scares him. When I ask him what\u2019s so scary about it, all he says is either \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m afraid you expect more\u201d, but I tell him constantly that he is good enough, our friendship is good enough, and I don\u2019t place any expectations on him. I am VERY clear about that. I\u2019m not one to beat around the bush. \n\nHe asked me to move out a few days ago. He said he needs to work on his own issues and he can\u2019t do that while I\u2019m living in the same house. The problem is, I don\u2019t have any family or savings and I\u2019ve got my life established (work, doctors, vehicle, etc.) here and I think it\u2019s both unfair to ask me to change my life so drastically so he can try to isolate himself again, only to most likely end up staying with me where ever I end up going, and unhealthy to push away the only person he has any sort of relationship with depth away because he\u2019s struggling with his \u201cissues\u201d (anxiety, depression, finances, etc.)\n\nSo here\u2019s my question. Do you think he might have feelings for me? Feelings he might be projecting onto me? He\u2019s never been good at emotional intimacy with anyone (grew up in a rough family, came out in college and casually dated but broke things off before they got serious, I\u2019m his only close friend) and I think he might be scared of our closeness because his feelings run deeper than just friendship. It\u2019s even scarier to consider because he\u2019s a gay man and I\u2019m a woman, which puts into question many different things including identity. \n\nPlease ask clarifying questions if need be. The situation is pretty complicated and I\u2019ve run out of options in regards to people who I can bounce ideas off of. I can also only talk to myself so much, and obviously I\u2019m going to have some bias. \n\nTL;DR - I think my best friend of 8+ years (27M) who is gay is in love with me (28F) and I don\u2019t know how to talk to him about it without him shutting down.",

I'm very sedentary, I don't have time to go to the gym, but I do walk three to four times a week for 30 minutes to an hour. I have been intermittent fasting all my life (I'm not hungry when I wake up, so I just don't eat until my lunch at 1 or 2 pm).\n\nEDIT: wow, a second wake up call in less than a month, I'm going to have an epiphany at this rate, thanks for the quick answers, especially the one who posted the link, I think I'm going to add peanuts, they are very caloric and cheap, avocado and nuts are just way over my budget, or maybe stop shying from full spoons of oil (I was using 1/3) that would up the meals to 500-600 calories, plus my beloved banana, and bam, I'm on track again)",

  "author": "byrobot",
  "self_text": "I really messed up and I needed to somewhere to vent so hoping this isn't the wrong format /venue.\n\nI'm in my late 30s and was first diagnosed with depression when I was a young child. I started taking meds on and off in my teens and more consistently since I was around 20. I've worked for a long time to find the right medication and dosage to keep me feeling more-or-less 'normal' and allow me to go about my day-to-day life. \n\nThis past summer I went through a rough patch, so to help me through it, my psychiatrist increased the dosage for my anti-depressant by adding an extra 10 mg cap on top of a standard daily 20 mg. I had already filled the 20 mg for that month, so the extra 10 mg was a separate RX.\n\nAfter a few weeks I got on a more even keel and reverted to my prior dosage, which I've been on for the last couple of months. At my last refill, however, the pharmacist filled the temporary 10 mg instead of the 20 mg. I didn't know the 10 mg RX had refills, and didn't think to check the label, so I've been taking a single 10 mg cap per day for the past week thinking they were 20 mg, halving my dosage. \n\nI've been struggling the last few days and this goes a long way to explaining why. In a way it was good news because once I reestablish the higher dose things should start getting back to normal.  But, in the short term, I'm still having  deep feelings of despair and dread. \n\nI know 10 mg doesn't sound like a lot, but I try to take a low dose to minimize side effects, and 20 mg is just enough to be effective for me. It's also difficult to say how much of what I'm feeling is attributable to a reemergence of my predisposition for depression, or withdrawal symptoms caused by transitioning between doses, but either way, I haven't been in a good place.\n\nUnderstanding that the way I'm feeling is largely owed to unplanned changes in brain chemistry, I'm trying to step back to evaluate the feeling I'm having for what they are and not let them consume me entirely, which is part of why I thought it would help to rant about this, but for now I'm still not able to separate myself from these experiences.\n\nCurious to know whether anyone has experiences with dosage errors or deliberate reductions and have any good ways to cope? It so happens that I'm attending a wedding out of town as the best man later this week and am having to do detailed planning, so it this really came at a bad time.\n\nThanks for listening",

  "author": "HipHappinenGrandma",
  "self_text": "If my mom texted me instead of called, you'd recognize her from r/insaneparents. Though she's not insane enough to put cameras in my room, she's definitely insane enough to threaten to do so.\n\nIn a few weeks from now, my bf will be taking care of a relative's pet, and because we have been dating for over 6 years, that relative said that I'm more than welcome to stay in their house during that week. In the past, I've asked my mom if he could sleep over for the night since he works until 12am and our house is only 10 minutes away vs his house being 50 minutes away. She glared at me as if I asked her to please eat my dog's shit, and say of course not. (Please note: I got this idea from her, because it is what *her* bf does)\n\nSo, after 6 years of dealing with her shit towards my bf, the two of us have had enough and want a week together. We just want to know what it'd be like *when* we move in together, because we're saving up money to do it asap. When I was 19, I did the **unthinkable**. I left my house without permission for the second time, so I could be with my bf. When I did that, my mom came home early from work (she felt sick) and found out I wasn't home. She called and called and called, I texted her basically saying I am an adult and I shouldn't have to be treated like a child. Que her pulling the victim card and telling EVERYONE in the family that I ran away from home, I slept over at his house, I was kidnapped etc etc etc. In the end, despite my argument being that \"I pay rent, cable, wifi, groceries, and sometimes other bills, so I should be able to be my own person\", literally everyone sided with my mom because, ultimately, \"You live under her house so its her rules\".\n\nI was never a rebellious child. Note how I said I left the house for the *second* time without permission? The first time, I asked my aunt to take me to watch my bf in his sport competition, and when my mom found out she slapped me so hard for \"embarrassing\" her that my lower lip got slightly busted. I always had good grades, never talked back, always did my best so I could prevent her bs. So, now that both my bf and I have cars and stable jobs, I want to be able to act like the adult that I'm supposed to be. However, I'm still scared of what my mom might do. I plan on telling her about it after her or her bf take me to college, as I still don't have my license so I need someone with a liscense in the car with me, and I only go 2x a week so I'd tell her after the last class day of that week. Should I even tell her though? And this won't be a \"Can I go?\", it'll be an \"I'm going\" so I'm bracing myself for a shit storm my way.\n\nTL;DR my mom's an asshole and I want to spend a week alone with my bf so we both know what home life is like, since we both plan on living together soon. I'm not sure when would be the best time to tell her, because there's no way she'll be happy about it",

I knew it would only be harder if I truly told you everything that I've missed and everything that I've learned during my time with you. I made a list of the good things that came from us when we were lovers before when we tried just being friends, but this time I want to extend that list. Bullet point by bullet point let me put everything I've missed from then into words, cause it's like you said... Sometimes thoughts need to be said or typed out for them to feel real. \n\nSo here I go.....\n\n\u2022 I've never felt so open to be able to talk about anything and everything with anyone like we did. Everything from the mondaine simple topics to subjects that really gave food for thought which paved the way to lengthy, elongated messages. And always looking forward to the next mini novel of opinions we liked to bat back and forth with each other. You asked for my opinion rather than just looking for an ear to chatter at. Sense you've left it's been even more apparent to me when someone only wants to be validated when they open up to talk to me instead of asking for another's perspective. That's not something I only loved about you but it's something that I respected. And now that I'm without it it's given me another realization. You are someone I could've grown with, witness and see the small changes in me throughout life and I you. You knew when to encourage me and when to give the hard honest answer even if it wasn't nice you knew what needed to be said. You're honesty coupled with your genuinely caring nature showed you care and loved, not just me, but everyone you keep close to you even when you had some harsh words to say I always knew it came from a loving \u2764\ufe0f.\n\n\u2022 The way you touched me, always trying to put your hand down my shirt or up my sleeve. It was like you where always trying to get under my clothes even during normal conversation, I loved that! And when I put on my Hanley it was like giving you an open door for your hands to wander around my chest. You laughed at me when I told you how I deliberately wore that shirt for that reason, Ooo I know your hands all to well. You desired me as much as I desired you, we fed off of that and it only made it all better. I'll always remember our back seat adventures, as well as the times we were able to have our privacy. But most of all I'll miss those moments at the very end, when we would just talk after we were both satisfied. Something about those moments, how we would talk and make out. Just feeling close to someone again in that way... Yes the sex was always apart of it, but that moment was what it was all about. It was truly intimate.\n\n\u2022 You are expressive in every lovable way. Brown eyes will never be the same to me, I don't know how you do it but they always caught the light perfectly to sparkle a bit everytime you smiled. I even went through some of your old videos, I kept thinking it was just my imagination. My mind romanticizing your imagine but nope! My memory of you remains true, with video evidence(#nofilter) your eyes, do indeed, always caught the light perfectly to shine.\n\nWe both found something perfect in a situation so wrong, but it's as they say. The right people never come into your life at the wrong time, for the right people are timeless to us even when we're forced to part ways. And that's what you are to me... Timeless. I will remember you for the rest of my life, always looking back to my time spent with you. Hidden in this secret chapter of my life I changed for the better, learned and matured with someone as wonderful as you. Thank you, I only wish you the best in every new chapter of life you come to. I hope our time together will only be reflected on as a positive time as the years pass for you. \n\nToday,\nI think I'm ready\nI'm ready to close this chapter of my life.\n\nGoodbye mi tesorito\ud83d\udc95\n\n\n\nThanks for reading this far, and thanks to everyone else who shares on this sub.

The problem with this is that my husband is a painting contractor and works a lot of weekend so I am the one that is stuck watching the child. The other day when we dropped the child off at his grandparents the mother was there to pick him up and I saw my husband hand her money that she quickly put in her bra (she is white trash) I know it wasn't her support because that is due next week so this was in addition to that. Do I have any business asking why he gave her money or how much? I am always upfront about money (whats mine is ours ),and feel like I should have been asked if I had a problem giving her money which I would have.

  "self_text": "I want to preface all this by saying we have only been together a couple months, so things are still pretty new. Also, the title isn't 100% accurate because she isn't really sure about her sexuality I guess.\n\nWe met and basically hit it off, I really like her personality and vice versa, we hang out every day etc.  The only true hangup I have with the relationship is the sexual side of things.  She had a very bad experience with sex and now essentially believes she is either asexual or that she just doesn't enjoy it.   She is not uncomfortable with the idea of sex in general, and jokes about that kind of stuff all the time.\n\nThe thing that is very confusing to me is that she is very physical and comfortable with everything up to explicitly sexual acts.  So, as you can imagine this leads to a lot of confusion for me, as I don't know where the end game in the relationship is, physically speaking.  I really like her and I don't want this to be something that ruins the relationship, but it is an important aspect of the relationship to me.\n\nAny advice on how to approach the subject with her, navigate the problem, etc. is welcome.",

  "self_text": "CW some cursing.\n\nWell I originally posted this to r/namenerds and was suggested to post this here. I thought of posting here originally but thought I would be redirected there so here we are. I've edited it a bit for some more information to do with the family. \n\n\n\nSo I've had a name in mind from the beginning of my pregnancy. Ivy Violet Rose and last name starts with F. \n\nI did not want to tell anyone the name until the baby was here. The father told people the second they asked. This was before we even had the ultrasound where you normally find out the gender. He also told his entire family I was pregnant the day I took an at home pregnacy test while I was at work. I told him I didn't want people to know I until I was out of the danger zone for a miscarage (had one in a previous relationship) and that I didn't want to have to go through telling a lot of people the same story over and over. (He has a large family about 15 siblings) His response was he wanted everyone to know so he could have support if that happened. \n\nWell the great grandfather on the fathers side informed me he was going to call her Rose because that's what he preferred. I said well she gets that from my middle name (which is a family name) and most of my family calls me by middle name or the southern style first and middle name so that will probably be confusing. Well after I dropped that I decided to keep Ivy Violet with the last name starting with F. \n\nMy mother with same last name is extremely offended that her initials will be IVF like in vitro fertilization. (I wasn't planning on her having my last name but the father went off the deep end) \n\nWell the rest of the fathers family (his siblings and cousins) have told me they are all going to call her violent not Violet. Which frustrates because I find it rude to put that on a child and because it's after her great great grandmother. \nHis family is completely serious about this. They take it as a complement to call her this. I think its immature personally. They want her to be a bad ass fighter. Cue Eye roll..\n\nThen my grandfather told me today he is going to call her poison. Not after the Batman character but after the plant his wife is extremely allergic to. (Violet is after his mother)\n\nShould I just roll over and name her what my second option was? Athena Jade F?",

I'm off the CICO wagon and am gaining weight back.\n\nSomething that was very important for my past weight loss was, as much as possible, eliminating will-power from the equation. It was also really important that I had a routine when it came to eating - so the lazy, no-brainer, default option was the one that made for my weight loss. That's not so simple when I'm on the move, don't have access to my refrigerator/freezer/kitchen/cooking, and have a very generous food allowance (which I can spend at a supermarket, btw).\n\nIs it possible to do low-willpower, low-thought CICO in these circumstances? Is it possible to have an eating routine when there are so many variables in my life? I really don't want to gain the weight back. I want to lose the weight I've put on over the past several months and keep it off.

Around the beginning of this summer, I started to feel like I was able to go long periods of time without thinking about my ex. \n\nBack in August I [27 M] met this girl [21]. She seemed cool. Her heart was recently broken. Her ex cheated on her. For that reason, I was a bit weary because I knew that heartbreak and I knew it lasted a long time. We started talking more. I started to really like her. Like a lot. Like she was on my mind all day. And the feelings on her end seemed mutual. I don\u2019t know what falling in love means, but I knew I didn\u2019t want to talk to anybody else and that I wanted to spend all of my time with her. \n\nShe started up school again recently. The stress and anxiety caught up to her and she feels overwhelmed. The vibes started to change. She seemed to be really depressed. I thought it\u2019d be a good idea to give her some space so she can properly heal the way I did. So we haven\u2019t talked for a couple of weeks. I told her I\u2019d wait for her until she started to feel better about things, and I\u2019ll be there when she\u2019s ready to let somebody into her life. \n\nI just miss her every day. I know it\u2019s only been a couple of months since we started talking but I\u2019ve dated so much since my breakup and nobody makes me feel this way. \n\nI feel so fucking selfish for wanting to be in her life even though she\u2019s not ready for me. I tried putting myself out there again but nobody really compares. She stood out. We had intense beautiful chemistry. \n\nShe\u2019s all I think about. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know how long I should wait before I reach out again. I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll forget me. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll never have this chance again. \n\nI also feel really stupid for falling for somebody so quickly. I thought I was guarded after my last breakup but I guess I\u2019m doomed to repeat it all again. \n\nAny advice on the situation would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTl;dr: I fell for a girl, we\u2019re taking space, I really miss her and my feelings are all over the place.\n\nEdit: spelling",

  "author": "tampon_tragedy",
  "self_text": "In the past 10 years, I have been completely ghosted by three different people that I once considered to be my best friend.\n\nThe first was a woman I befriended in undergrad. We are both writers, so we immediately bonded over our shared excitement about poetry. I even helped her move to another state by putting her and her partner up in my home for a year. It made me happy to have her and her dude nearby, and I feel like she was also happy to be with me. Two years ago, she stopped returning my texts and calls altogether. We live about 5 minutes from each other, so I can't blame physical distance. I have been turning everything over and over in my head in an attempt to figure out what happened. The only thing I can think of is that she is a WOC and very entrenched in identity politics. I am white, and I know she's expressed a frustration with white privilege. I always tried my hardest to hear and support her, but maybe I just didn't do enough? I can't figure it out.\n\nThe second woman was someone I met in graduate school. I was alone in a new state for the first time, and I had gone through a particularly hard experience. She was the first person I befriended, and she made me feel so much better. I met her family, spent holidays together, and I deejayed her wedding. Again, she stopped returning my calls, texts and emails. Nothing. It's been 7 years. The only thing I can imagine happened is that I had given her advice about the woman she was seeing back then. She began cheating on her partner with another woman, and I told her she should come clean and either end it or make amends. Again, I have no idea what I could have done. I think about it everyday. I wish I knew.\n\nI found out last night that my best friend, who had been MIA (to me) the last few days has been in touch with another friend of ours. I have been sick worrying about her, and I'm so glad she's ok. But now I also know that she has no interest in talking to me. I think she might have blocked my number. Again, I wish I knew what I could have done. I've been sick about it all night and this morning. I told her I was thinking about doing a dinner last week, but my husband left town last minute. I have a 17 month old kid, so I couldn't do much outside of taking care of him. I forgot about the dinner altogether. It was just a maybe, but she might have thought I blew her off. I've tried to apologize, but my calls don't go through. And she won't text back. I've told a couple other friends about this, and they are also confused.\n\nI can own up to the fact that I'm flighty. I try not to flake, but sometimes it slips my mind. Especially now that I have a kid. I also tend to talk a lot. You can probably tell by this post. Am I totally an asshole and I just don't know? Am I missing something? I would really like to know how to move past this and keep trusting friends. I don't know if I can.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nThree different friends in three separate occasions have ghosted me, and I can't figure out why it keeps happening.",

  "author": "awaythrow850633",
  "self_text": "Tl;dr at the bottom. \n\nI [30m] slipped into a weird triangle over the last few years. I dated multiple girls over a long period of time. Sometimes I had more, sometimes less serious relationships. I have always been clear with my intentions and never said things I didn't mean. It worked out pretty well for all participants but in the last few months two relationships began to intensifie to a level that is too much for being casual. Actually two relationships to two girls around my age, I will call them girl A and girl B. \n\nFor your explanation, I have already been into a serious relationship with girl B for a while some years ago but it didn't work out that well so we ended up with some sort of casual relationship that has way less commitment but actually looks like a serious relationship for both of us (because we couldn't let our fingers of each other). \nGirl A and I are dating now for a long time too. We're good friends and partners by now.\n\nTo get straight to the point: both relationships to girl A and B are officially completely casual relationships, but in reality they are not anymore. Not for me and not for anyone else I assume. Here is the tricky part: even though we are completely honest with each other, we hardly ever spoke about other partners or anything, so nobody knows about anybody else and it's killing me inside. At this point right now I am pretty much afraid bringing it up because I don't want to ruin anything. Besides that weird situation we're in, the relationships are both absolutely smooth and awesome, emotional and physical.\n\nTo make that weird situation a little more spicy: we all moved to the same city just before summer and are living pretty close now. Like literally two blocks away. It's just too much to stay one night here the other night there. This was fun when it was casual but I somehow missed the point where it went too serious. I honestly can't really take it anymore emotionally with two unofficial partners. RN it is just weird but there is no outlook in getting better without me taking action. I don't want to ruin anything, I don't want to be rude and I don't want to let anybody down but I want to be honest. Also I don't want to \"choose\" anybody and I don't want to be an asshole. This is messed up, please give advice how to deal with this\n\nTl:dr:\nTwo casual relationships got too serious. Now kinda have two unofficial girlfriends. Missed point of no return.

I dont even know where to start but here we go:\nThere was 5 of us: J, G, A and S.They were my best friends since 6th grade. Well not S. She was friends with G and G introduced her to our friend group last year and became everyones best friend. Except me. I was sort of replaced in a way. My friends and i were pretty close before S came along but we kind of drifted when this happened. I felt like S didnt like me from the start. We never really talked. Her and I are actually very similar. Quiet at first but also can be a bit loud. Hell, she even looks like me. We both have naturally curly dirty blonde hair and glasses.\nSo at the start of 8th grade my friend group and I became closer again. We were in most of the same classes, except S. I was secretly happy about this. We hung out all the time (were talking maybe 5 days a week), going to the mall or to Starbucks and hanging out at the park. We did have a small fight however, that only lasted a day or 2.  In which I offered to switch classes with S so she could be with her best friends, as they were always talking about how they wished she was in their class. Like I said, this only lasted a day or 2 but S continued to seem kind of.. I dont really know how to explain it. \nThen today happened. In math class this morning, we were doing a group project. J, G, A and i were working together. G told me I had something on the back of my clothes. I didnt believe her,  as she had lied about this before. Then my other friends began to say this too. And they would not let up on it either. So I believed them. As I was going to the bathroom to go look in the mirror, I heard them laughing and whispering from behind me. I looked in the mirror and it turned out there was nothing on my pants. I came back to still see them laughing and whispering. \"Did you see it?\" G asked me. I told them no and they still insisted there was something on my pants. My dumb ass believed them and I walked around with my hoodie pulled down for that class. They were still whispering about shit, probably me. That really hurt. That was when I lost it on them. I started yelling about why the hell they always did that shit and told them that if they didnt want to be friends anymore than they could just tell me. \"Oh, were doing this again?\" said J. Ouch. \"It was just a stupid prank\" said A. \"You should have seen how I pranked S.\" said G. You might be reading this, thinking I over reacted and thats fine but for me I was kind of offended. I reflected on all the other things that happened in the past and how if i had a fight with G for example, everyone would side with her and gang up on me. And how J would always brush things I said off as unimportant shit and make me feel stupid. And how when the teacher said to get in a group of 2 or 3 J, G and A would always be in a group, leaving me out. I stopped talking to them. At break I confronted G and asked her to just tell me if she didnt want to be friends. \"Dont even answer that question. Lets go.\" J said to G. I was almost in tears. I texted my dad that i was sick and asked him to pick me up. I went home and made this reddit account. If you made it this far, thanks for reading. But now I dont know what im supposed to do tomorrow. They were pretty much my only friends and now I have none. I guess ill type up some more stuff about my life on here.",

Thing with her would be difficult from the start i knew she was messed up and i was/am ok with it i understand and get it i was there too once just want her to be happy. \n\nSo Chass doesn't message me cute shit alot or call or talk to me on the regular i just assumed it was cause she doesn't want to talk about her feelings and what not but i know for a fact that she does like me cause her roomate/ best friend has told me alot and that she can be very stubborn @ times and not mature about it also this whole time that we've been taking I've been kept a secret only her close friends know about us taking.. oh and i also met her parents... That only one other dude has ever met but yet..\n\nNow the problem.. (Sigh) so Jen comes back into the picture being really nice, sweet, kind and i tell her that I'm kinda taking to this other girl atm (Chass) she understands kinda backs off she still txts me and and there says alot of nice things all the meanwhile Chass is putting in near 0 effort doesn't do nearly half of the effort Jen is putting in...\n\nNow last night Jen called me while she was @ a club and says \" Im at this club with all these people now tell me why i only want to talk to you?\"  Hit right in the feels like damn\n\nSo in conclusion Chass being the girl who i really like but I'm obviously more into her then she is into me or Jen the girl who's putting in all this effort or should i just say f this im out and not date either \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude05",

I got rejected from the kids transgender clinic as by the time I would be seen I would no longer be under 18. This meant I would be in the different sector for adult mental health.\n\nIn August I got a letter from the mental health clinic stating that I should contact them and opt in, which I did literally immediately. A month and a bit goes by and I haven't heard anything, so I email the clinic explaining that I had received no update and would like confirmation on my status.\n\nI proved my DOB and name (though she messed it up and called me Robyn instead of Robin which made me feel 10x worse because they literally messed up the thing I'm being referred for, showing they just don't care much) but that's when i found out I have a confirmed \"over two year\" wait just to have my first meeting (where meetings after that are normally a 3-6 month wait within themselves).\n\nI've been trying for a year already to go on T and the thought of me waiting 2-3 more years is honestly so painful so now I'm trying to go private. Only issue is, it'll cost me like \u00a32,000 as I live in Northern Ireland and excluding the service costs for the professionals, I have to travel oversees to London just to be able to go private.\n\n It sucks because all iI have is \u00a391 in my savings now, am in a college course which is roughly 30h a week (drastically affecting my chances of finding part time jobs with suitable hours) and honestly the whole ordeal has really put a toll on my mental health because I feel like I won't ever get the money to go private, but two/three years is a long time for me to wait and I'm just stuck in this rut of not knowing what to do or how to feel.",

Please don't scold me, I'm here for advice and I'm already aware i'm a prick.\n\nMe and my partner are both motorcyclists, so I'm probably intimidating by default, especially at night, in the rain, on a secluded street and to a lone young woman. I hate riding in the rain because it's just way harder to control the bike, this woman didn't see my girlfriend or myself and almost ran me off the road with my partner having to speed up the street to dodge her car. She knocked my bike over, I fell off and I skidded a few meters; but I was fine. I got up and threw my helmet off before charging to her car. She got out and waving her hands up, asking if we were okay but I punched her bonnet and broke her wing mirror. I ignored her and she redirected her attention to my partner as I was just standing/walking around her car. I just remember being so angry and my leg was feeling tight and horrid so I was just pacing the pain and anger away, in hindsight I must have been very intimidating. My girlfriend walked over to me and asked me to stand near her bike (maybe 20m away) I asked why, she said that I was scaring the woman. I said that was ridiculous and she said that I was scaring her too. My heart sank and I walked over to her bike where I sat whilst they sorted out the insurance. Not much else was said, we parted ways and my partner and I went home and straight to bed. I asked my partner if I really scared her and she said I did, but she knows I wouldn't hurt her- but a stranger wouldn't know that.\n\nIt broke my heart that I scared her, and i'm not really sure what to do from here. I take full blame and I know I overreacted to what was a fairly minor incident. What can I say or do to make it up to my partner? Or just so that *I* feel better about the shit show I caused.

We're only 16 and I've been trying to hold her off, but she was getting upset at me for not letting her, now I love this girl and I don't wanna lose her. Something in my mind just went oh screw it and we ended it up doing it a bit without protection, I didn't go very deep or hard at all. But we did it twice and I don't think I came. \n\nSo today my girlfriend has been complaining of tireness, feeling hungry and slight nausea. We're both slightly concerned she is pregnant. She's due her period tomorrow so I guess we'll find out then, however she has been taking the pill pretty much since her Mum somehow found out about us having sex. I also know that her parents are very against us having any type of intercourse and if she is pregnant they will react badly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess the question here is what the hell should I do if it is a thing? How should we go about telling her parents if it is real? And what are the odds she actually is pregnant considering what I said above?",

The only thing I needed to do for my gram was give her breakfast and her pills in the morning and sometimes help with dinner. I've done those things but as I moved in I realized that my gram was COMPLETELY neglected before I moved in. \n\nMy mom REFUSES to listen to anyone who suggests we might soon start making plans for once my grams memory and health completely declines. She barely bathes her, never does her laundry, never insists on taking her to the proper doctor appointments and most importantly REFUSES to hire an aid that will come in for a couple of hours while I'm not home. I've researched plenty of this but mom says that she has already researched and Medicaid won't cover anything, which is not correct.\n\nAnyway, we had a long discussion about how it's time that gram gets an aid because I need help (after yelling at her on the phone in frustration the day before, to which she hung up on me.)\nThe conversation was calm and she tried to suggest that she does more so we don't have to hire an aid but I told her that I am not really taking no for an answer, since I'm the one that actually loves with her and goes to school full-time/works full-time, which my mother does not.\n\nLater she started getting triggered about how her parents didn't want her, but she wanted me so badly. She then went on to talk about how poorly I treat her and how she texts her friends the things I say and they think I treat her awfully. She then finished by saying that she loves me but I'm too toxic to be around. She corrected herself and said that she loves me, but she currently loves herself more. \nMy boyfriend who lives with my gram and I thought that she had verbally disowned me. I texted my dad later, who she turned on too during that conversation, about how she might have just verbally disowned me and he said he knows and he's very sorry.\n\n I'm very confused and obviously still hurt by this, even though I've spent years being able to brush off her comments. I'm miserable and sad and she's ruining my life. I don't understand what she means by what she said  because I'm still in shock. Please help. I need support. I feel so ANGRY and empty.",

Well, the next day we made up and he apologized saying it was just in the heat of the moment and he didn\u2019t mean any of it.\n\nWell, this has happened every single time we have fought. We don\u2019t fight much, but when we do it\u2019s usually a big fight and he always calls his mom to explain the fight and complain about me. I find it upsetting, rude, heartbreaking, etc. First of all, I have to hear him talk shit about me, and I hate the fact that his parents just know every fight; and it just makes me look bad! I feel like our fights should just be kept private, especially because every fight we\u2019ve had we always make up within a few hours. I understand if the fight is lasting days, then it\u2019s okay to call someone up and ask for help. But to call WHILE we are fighting to complain about me? Just no.\n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do at this point. We\u2019ve made up from the fight and everything is normal now but this is still in my mind. This has happened many times but this time has really made me think since we live together now three hours away from our hometown. I was hoping this would give him some independence and have him stop relying on his mom as much, but sadly it doesn\u2019t seem like it.\n\nI want to full on talk to him about it but I\u2019m afraid he will get mad at me for bringing it up. I lightly asked him to not call his mom every time we fight and that it\u2019s disrespectful to me, he said sure but I don\u2019t think he fully understood why and I feel like it will just happen again.\n\nWe\u2019ve been together for four years and pretty much everything else is great between us but this. I don\u2019t want this to ruin us but I don\u2019t think I can deal with having another fight and hearing him call mommy to talk shit about me. Any suggestions on how I should approach this and what to say?\n\nTLDR: my bf calls his mom after every fight to talk crap about me and I\u2019m not sure what to do about it\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your honest feedback. I know this is a bad thing. But I ended up talking to him about it, and we had a very long conversation. He seemed like he genuinely knew it was wrong and said he would stop. I let him know if this happens more, I won't be able to continue this relationship. He said he understood and he knows its immature and that he will stop, so I really hope this is the case. He's a great guy, this is his biggest flaw, so I really hope something works out. Thanks again",

  "author": "pushitsomrwhereelse",
  "self_text": "Throwaway account for privacy. Also on mobile and first time poster so I apologize for formatting. TLDR at bottom.\n\nA little background information for context: Me and my gf have been dating for over 4 years, have a son about to turn 1, who I love more than anything in this world besides her, and another on the way (10 weeks along.) Weve lived together in various apartments for the last 3 years. We share income and expenses although I work full time and she works part time on top of being a stay at home mom so I probably make 10 times as much as her.\n\nI started to get some hints that my gf was a little emotionally abusive towards me, and about a month ago I started trying to document through notes on my phone and mental notes signs of emotional abuse. And after thinking it over I don't know how I didn't see it sooner. \n\nShe checks off almost every box, the controlling behavior, jealousy, the treating me like a child, belittling my hobbies and trying to dissuade me from any activity that took any time or attention away from her. I always thought of this as just being quirky and playful. \n\nWell a few days ago it really hit me. She was in a particularly bad mood after I had been working almost all day on a day I normally have off. She was getting upset that I wanted to go get groceries since we were running low, and I had been gone all day. She couldn't go with me because our 1 year old was asleep, and I had offered for them to come with me earlier but she had said she was too tired. \n\nIn the argument if you want to call it that, she started to get physical with me, it didn't really hurt and I think she was just being playful. But because I had been paying attention to signs like this recently I immediately was alarmed and asked her to stop. The two things she said to me that really got to me were \"I want to punch you, it'll feel good.\" And \"Where are you going, you big baby? I'm not done being mean to you.\" Which was said in response to me leaving the room to avoid the situation. \n\nI went to get groceries heart broken that night, and brought home flowers as an apology for being gone so long that day and her having a bad day. \n\nI have no clue what to do. I love her so much. I love our son more than anything, and I couldn't bare to be without him in my life. She is a wonderful mother, and her behavior is only towards me. I don't think I have the strength to bring it up or try to leave, and it would be so complicated to try. We have a lease together for another 8 months, and if I tried to leave both of our lives would be much worse, she wouldn't have enough money from child support to afford the apartment or lifestyle we have, I wouldn't be able to afford to live anywhere besides my parents which is not suitable for children and I don't think I could get any form of custody there. \n\nI feel helpless in this situation, which is at odds with the fact that I'm a fit 200 lb kickboxer, and I'm scared of leaving my 5'2\" gf, no one would ever believe my story, and its not like she's actually doing any damage to me. But I don't want to live my life like this.\n\nTLDR I realized my pregnant gf is emotionally and physically abusive, although not physically damaging. I'm afraid that if I leave, both our lives will be worse for it and I'll never see my son. What are my options? Thank you everyone for taking the time to read this and try to give advice.",

  "author": "saadhilo",
  "self_text": "A little background: last year my 4 year relationship ended. I was pretty devastated and depressed and it took me a really long time to get over it. Around the beginning of this summer, I started to feel like I was able to go long periods of time without thinking about my ex. \n\nBack in August I [27 M] met this girl [21]. She seemed cool. Her heart was recently broken. Her ex cheated on her. For that reason, I was a bit weary because I knew that heartbreak and I knew it lasted a long time. We started talking more. I started to really like her. Like a lot. Like she was on my mind all day. And the feelings on her end seemed mutual. I don\u2019t know what falling in love means, but I knew I didn\u2019t want to talk to anybody else and that I wanted to spend all of my time with her. \n\nShe started up school again recently. The stress and anxiety caught up to her and she feels overwhelmed. The vibes started to change. She seemed to be really depressed. I thought it\u2019d be a good idea to give her some space so she can properly heal the way I did. So we haven\u2019t talked for a couple of weeks. I told her I\u2019d wait for her until she started to feel better about things, and I\u2019ll be there when she\u2019s ready to let somebody into her life. \n\nI just miss her every day. I know it\u2019s only been a couple of months since we started talking but I\u2019ve dated so much since my breakup and nobody makes me feel this way. \n\nI feel so fucking selfish for wanting to be in her life even though she\u2019s not ready for me. I tried putting myself out there again but nobody really compares. She stood out. We had intense beautiful chemistry. \n\nShe\u2019s all I think about. I don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know how long I should wait before I reach out again. I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll forget me. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ll never have this chance again. \n\nI also feel really stupid for falling for somebody so quickly. I thought I was guarded after my last breakup but I guess I\u2019m doomed to repeat it all again. \n\nAny advice on the situation would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTl;dr: I fell for a girl, we\u2019re taking space, I really miss her and my feelings are all over the place.\n\nEdit: Spelling",

She's gorgeous, compassionate, hard-working, I could go on. Our main problem has been sex for the last few years and quite a bit of that has to do with us having opposite schedules. I only really get to hang with her once or twice a week as a result. Lately, I have had the feeling that we're growing apart somewhat and this lack of companionship has looking elsewhere to fill this void. \nA month ago, at my works staff party I met a girl and we ended up hanging out for most of the night. Yes, she was pretty and I was a bit attracted to her but she was just easy to talk to and we shared some stories and many mutual interests. At the end of the night she sort of made a pass at me to which I said I was involved with someone else but I was very flattered. She told me about how her ex cheated on her many times with different women and it hurt her alot and she would never want to put anyone through what she went through. I found her a honesty beautiful and very commendable. In the coming days I mentioned our interaction to my partner so I could clear my mind and she understood where I was coming from. I told her work has been really tough I don't have a lot of friends at work and it was really refreshing having this new friend. Since then we have gotten together a few other times to hang out and each of the times I let me girlfriend know I was her. For some reason we just clicked but she told me that she now absolutely has feelings for me and now I can't stop thinking about her and it's fucking killing me. I feel sick just thinking about it.\nWhat do I do? Please help!",

  "self_text": " My girlfriend (21) asked me (22) about my ex today. We have been together for 11 months. \n\n \n\nMy previous (and first) relationship was when I was still a teenager. It ended when I was 18, not at bad terms but because we just drifted away, and we haven't had much conversation since, besides things like, \"hey happy new year\" - \"hey thanks you too\". My girlfriend didn't ask me about my previous relationship but I didn't tell her either. Perhaps I assumed she doesn't care because I wouldn't think too much if she has had a relationship before and I believe her experience made her who she is now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen today my girlfriend asked me about her, because she received a notification on her phone saying today's her birthday (not really but more on that later). It was because she lost her phone, and there aren't phones on the market that suits her interest, so I gave (or lent) her my spare iphone. I think the birthday event got synced between devices from my email/contact which I didn't delete. What's weird is that this morning the notification was displayed with my ex's nickname, which I do not use because we stopped contact. Then with me doing absolutely nothing, later today it changed to her full name. It must have been so suspicious to her, seemingly I changed it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to explain to her that we have stopped contact a long time ago, and I really have no idea why it got changed. Also it shows other people's birthday too, like my flatmate's. I also mentioned it's not even her birthday today, but for whatever weird-a\\*\\* reason there are 3 birthday notifications on her phone, 2 correct, 1 incorrect (today). I also said to her, that ask if she would like to know anything, and that I don't want any misunderstandings between us, to which she replied she doesn't want to ask anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I feel really bad (regret? guilt?) for not telling her about my history in the first place. I admit I am insecure because I still don't have much experience in relationships.  I also worry about her because she is the kind of person who takes things personally. I am going to wait until before sleep to text her, to let her have some time. And I want a place/somebody to share this with. So yeah I came here. I am open to any advice/opinion and thanks for listening/reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: my girlfriend feels (challenged perhaps?) as she got to know my previous relationship.",

To accurately track my drinks, I need to know if my glass of wine is 125 mL, 175 mL, or 250 mL. At my latest Airbnb, I dug through the kitchen to find a measuring cup, and then I measured out each glass of wine during the several days I was there. I did it with water first, noting the \"fill line\" for 175 mL; that way when I poured a glass of wine from the bottle, I could do it real casual-like without looking like I was measuring.\n\nLast night I was at a business dinner at a hotel. I ordered a 250 mL glass of wine (I'm in the UK and you need to specify the amount when you order). When that glass came out, I swear I could *tell* it was not 250. It can be hard to just \"see\" it since wine glasses come in so many different shapes and sizes, but this was a small pour... right? Well, I wasn't going to say anything or complain, I just said thank you and drank it.\n\nTonight I ordered a glass from the hotel bar, agains specifying 250 mL. OK, now *this* was a proper 250 pour.\n\nI tell this story just to point out how little I used to pay attention to amounts. Whatever the pour size, who cares? I was going to order another, and another after that. But now that I'm tracking, I *do* pay attention. I make a conscious choice about drinking 4.5 units of alcohol vs 6.0 units of alcohol. I make a conscious choice before I order another glass. I know how much is \"enough\" for me to feel satisfied, and then I stop.\n\nAnd tonight I am stopping at this 250 mL glass. Cheers to all you, my support team in this journey. I can feel alcohol's grip loosening. We can do this, people.",

Now the book didn't mention, are you supposed to seal the needle holes after inoculation, or just leave the jar with tiny access points? \n\nThe Psilocybin Mushroom Bible also mentioned that you could grow within jars for a smaller yield, called Neglect Tek,  but did not elaborate very much. Is this something anyone here has done? Does the jar \"lid\" need to stay on constantly until harvest during this process?  \n\nAlso, I bought some larger jars, and I was wondering if I could use a hybrid method: making the 8oz jar cakes per the instructions, but then transferring them to these larger jars. (With the intention of neglecting them if that's a feasible method. )\n\nI'd imagine that harvesting would be a pain in the ass, but probably worth it if it gives a significant higher yield than attempting fruiting in the 8oz jars. \n\nThanks very much!",

But yesterday, I asked him if he could still see a future with us together and he said \"I don't know.\" \n\nI know, marriage is really far down the line, but to me relationships should have an end goal. And now every time he tells me how much he loves me I get that little voice in the back of my head saying it won't last. I asked if the reason he couldn't imagine a future together was because he just couldn't even think about marriage or it was because he couldn't imagine getting married to me. He said both, but couldn't tell me why. As in, he legitimately didn't know. \n\nI just don't know what to do; I know we still love each other so much, and he has so much time to change his mind. I do too, I guess. I asked him why he thought we wouldn't get married, and he mumbled something about me wanting it while he wasn't ready for it. What bothers me the most is that he changed his mind. He once was sure we'd get married, but things have changed since then, I guess. \n\nWe're now both in college and only see each other once every two weeks, but neither of us are interested in seeing other people. He's been really stressed with college and I'm sure this has affected him in some way.\n\nThe reason I'm so torn, is because we've been together for two and half years now and have had no problems whatsoever with our relationship. We're madly in love with each other. The only reason I'd break up with him is because of this, him saying he's not sure he can see a future with me.\n\nI know if I hold on, I'll have to deal with that little voice in my head for a long time, but it might be worth it in the end. But it also might just be better to cut things off now, even though neither of us really want to. \n\nI just like thinking about our future and he doesn't. \n\nAdvice on how to go about this, please? \n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend can't answer the question of if he wants to get married confidently and now I don't know if I should stick around or break things off",

I grew up to be a depressed, suicidal, socially anxious, and self-loathing person with zero self-esteem.\n\n\n\nNow that my sisters are teenagers things are even worse than when I was growing up. When I was a child, I would get a beating for stomping my foot or slamming a door. In contrast, my sisters can be rude and disrespectful, refuse to help out around the house, steal money, falsely accuse me of physical abuse, verbally abuse me, threaten me, sneak out of the house and take drugs etc. and there are no consequences. My parents gave up corporal punishment by the time my sisters were born but they didn\u2019t come up with any other strategy. \n\n\n\n\nI have suggested that my parents ask mental health professional for advice on how to manage their behavior. The response I got was, \u201cI don\u2019t need a therapist to tell me how to raise my children. I can raise my children however I want.\u201d\n\n\n\nOK. Fine. That is your right. However, my parents\u2019 decisions negatively affect everyone. Both of my sisters started to show signs of serious mental disorders around age 12. One sister has bipolar disorder with psychotic features and the other has schizoaffective disorder. When my middle sister was discharged from the hospital after a psychotic episode, my father decided to go against the doctor\u2019s orders and took her off her medication. Guess who had to take care of my sister when she was suffering from frequent hallucinations and paranoid delusions for months? It was not my father. My mother and I had to do it.\n\n\n \nThings got worse when my youngest sister began having psychotic episodes. She was mean, aggressive, verbally abusive, and violent. She was a danger to herself and other people. My parents refused to take her to the hospital even when she threatened to kill herself (and livestream it online) or brandished knives and threatened to kill me. Instead, they wanted me to stay home and \u201cwatch her\u201d while they went to work. \n\n\n\nI know that my siblings are struggling but we have no relationship and never talk. I feel no affection for them because of how they have treated me. I have a tiny bit of sympathy and compassion for my parents but I feel nothing but contempt for my siblings. I really think that my sisters need to be in therapy but my parents don\u2019t believe in it and refuse to take them. I tried to help my parents to get my sisters accommodations at school and walked them through every step but they never did it. \n\n\n\nMy mother and my (maternal) grandmother were the only people holding this dysfunctional family together. My grandmother died a few weeks ago. Now my own mother is barely managing due to the grief. \n\n\n\nMy mother firmly believes that if we prayed more and prayed as a family God would \u201cchange my dad\u2019s heart\u201d and heal her children of all their mental illnesses. She\u2019s even taken us to faith healers. I\u2019m an atheist so I just stare and say nothing whenever she complains that we are not making an effort because we never use the prayer and devotional books she bought us. I still have to go to church weekly and she signs me up for religious conferences/retreats without bothering to ask me if I want to go.\n\n\n\nMarriage counseling/family therapy probably wouldn\u2019t work at all because 1) My parents don\u2019t believe in therapy and 2) My father thinks that he is always right and the problem is everyone else. He has zero insight into his behavior and how he emotionally abuses the people around him. \n\n\n\nI can\u2019t handle this level of stress on a daily basis. I work at a job that I hate and come home to be with a bunch of people who make me miserable. I feel like the only way I am getting out of this house is if I kill myself. I am so tired of dragging myself through life. I don\u2019t know how to protect myself from the onslaught of negativity and dysfunction that I deal with on a daily basis. Most of the time I just want to hide under my desk and cry when I am at work.\n\n\n\n**Note:** I\u2019ve been in therapy for 14 years. I have the suicide hotline memorized, posted on /r/suicidewatch multiple times, and have come up with numerous safety plans with my therapists. My parents eventually allowed my sisters to take medication and see a psychiatrist regularly but living with them is still a very negative experience. Please don\u2019t reply with \u201cJust move out.\u201d That is the response I get on every other subreddit (after being downvoted to hell) and it is very unhelpful. I am not able to due to my current circumstances. If there was a viable way out of this I would have been gone three years ago.",

  "self_text": "Hi, I've been subbed here for a while, but didn't have any actual personal experience with dating a trans person. I thought this was an interesting community that would help me be a better ally.\n\nThen something transformative happened this past weekend at Folsom Street Fair in SF--I ran into an ex. Sorry for the length! I have a lot of feelings, but I am asking for advice at the end!\n\n*I'm going to use 'he' to refer to the person I dated, just because the person I met yesterday had no emotional resemblance to who I dated in college. Sorry if it's confusing, but I am only talking about one person! I'm a straight cis woman, and she identified as a straight cis man before coming out as MTF, for reference.*\n\nI dated her around 8 years ago, when he was an emotionally abusive asshole who was tantamount to an incel in the way he thought about women. A lot of the abuse was specifically misogynistic in nature, and the slut-shaming he put me through stayed with me for years and acutely damaged my self-worth. Beyond that, he used me and manipulated me, consciously preying on my codependency issues to the point I was cooking, cleaning, and even doing his homework for him. He then dumped me after nearly sexually assaulting me, and I lost all semblance of . I was such a wreck, attempting suicide and nearly dropping out of college. A year after we broke up, he apologized to me for being manipulative and abusive. I would have never thought his actions were intentional if he had not explicitly apologized for them. From my point of view, I gave him everything and he used my efforts to step over me until he had no use for me (he had started working out and wanted to explore his new options,and was more or less cheating on me by the end).\n\nFor years after we ended, I was so angry, so upset that he could so thoroughly upend my life and then go off happily with his own. I struggled with my self-esteem, my ability to have sexual encounters, and feelings of worthlessness because of the paranoia his judgment left me with. I had trouble trusting and loving someone as completely as I had loved him. Even after I had overcome most those obstacles, I still held onto the rage from my emotional scars. As far as I was concerned, what he did was unforgivable.\n\nAnd then I saw her at the Fair, freshly out as herself, awkwardly fiddling with a whip, and shyly smiling on the periphery of a conversation with her friends outside a club. That abrasive, overcompensating asshole was gone, and this sweet girl had taken his place.\n\nSuddenly, all the animosity I had been harboring, the \"*why would you, how could you, do this to someone you supposedly love?*\" melted away. I was given the answer I had so long sought when I saw her hair in the awkward growing-out phase, the foundation she used to disguise her stubble, and her still-developing personal style. There was a vulnerability, a truth, to her that I had never witnessed in him.\n\nWe caught up briefly, and I told her I was happy she was finally comfortable with herself. She said she was glad I was doing well, a hint of nervous guilt in her eyes. Then we went our separate ways.\n\nThings are still clicking into place for me--a new light on old behaviors. Frankly, I'm amazed that the edification from this revelation has contented me in a way I never thought could happen.\n\nA big part of me wants to reach out to her, to have an actual discussion about what we've been up to in the intervening years, but I'm not sure if she wants to rehash all those old, painful memories. Does she want to forget her past and all the anguish she must have gone through, the self-doubt and self-hate that is becoming so obvious with the gift of hindsight. I wouldn't blame her if she did.\n\nStill, my desire to catch up is so strong, and I am tempted to send her a no-pressure \"glad you're good, wanna catch up?\" follow-up. She kept glancing at me as we parted, probably wondering a lot of the same things I'm wondering about her. I want to know her story, but I know I'm not entitled to it. If people have advice on if or how to approach her, please share.",

  "author": "bluedreamerss",
  "self_text": "**UPDATE POST HERE** https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/dbwml2/update_filed_police_report_against_jnmom_for/\n\nSo basically, here\u2019s the rundown: \n\nOn 9/28/2019 I came home around 1PM to care for my cats before work. Their names are Kibble (had her since a baby, 2 1/2 yrs) and Bits (same deal, 1 1/2 years) and to my boyfriend and I, they are our children. We have our own little family. We\u2019ve been going through the process of cleaning out my boyfriends basement and his older brother\u2019s room so that the cats and I could live there. Since we didn\u2019t have any cat stuff set up yet, the cats were staying in my room. I hated leaving them all day but I knew it would only be a temporary situation. \n\nAnyway, I came home Sunday morning and the cats were gone. My mom rehomed them by making a Craigslist ad and she refused to answer any questions. I began screaming, crying, panicking and hyperventilating. I felt like I was going to pass out and she said to me \u201cstop, you\u2019re being ridiculous. they have a good home\u201d. She deleted all the text messages and emails and the post that came from this woman, so all I know about her is that she\u2019s an old woman who lives in an apartment and is home all day. We have no idea where our babies are. We\u2019re starting to think she\u2019s lying because her story is changing in small ways and doesn\u2019t add up, so we\u2019re going to check all the local shelters. \n\nYesterday was so hard, I had to work 3-11 but on every break I just broke down crying. My boyfriend was so heartbroken when I told him, the look on his face was all I needed to finally decide to go NC. I\u2019m only 20 years old but I don\u2019t even care, I\u2019m done with this woman. \n\nSo a lot of people suggested that I file a police report, which my boyfriend and I did a few hours ago. He asked me if I lived in my mom\u2019s house with the cats, I said yes, he asked if they were solely my property, I said yes. Then the officer said..\n\n\u201cI mean, this is a theft, so your mom could be fined or go to jail. Do you really want your mom to go to jail?\u201d \n\nI was a little stunned, I didn\u2019t know what to say at first. My boyfriend saw me struggling and jumped in to say \u201cWe don\u2019t know how far this will go, but we just want our cats back. That\u2019s all.\u201d \n\nI agreed and told the officer \u201cThis relationship is complicated, this isn\u2019t the first hurtful thing she\u2019s done but this is the worst. We don\u2019t know where our cats are and she\u2019s not telling us anything, so I don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and told me he would contact my mom to try and find out information. I went back to my house and packed up another bag of things and I\u2019m planning to make my final trip tomorrow for my art supplies and sentimental belongings. \n\nMy mom has done a lot of horrible shit over the years, but this is the cherry on top. \n\nI guess I\u2019m looking at where to go from here, right now I just want my cats back. That\u2019s all. She\u2019s a major narcissist so she just keeps pulling it back to herself and saying it made her \u201cfeel good\u201d to \u201cdo the right thing for the cats\u201d. I wish I could punch her in the face. I want to scream.\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys so much, my boyfriend and I have read every single comment and it's been very therapeutic for us. So many of you have reached out asking for updates, so I promise I will continue to update here and make a new post when appropriate.\n\nWhat we accomplished today: \n1. Filed the police report\n2. Contacted Kibble's adoption center to retrieve her microchip info/update our personal info there (still waiting for a response back)\n3. Posted everywhere.. Craigslist, lots of Facebook groups, Reddit, Nextdoor, PetFBI, nokillshelter.org (they send out alerts to all vets/shelters in the area if you donate), etc.\n4. Went to the grocery store we work at, gave them our plus card and UPC for the cat food, our manager is printing every receipt that shows we paid for cat supplies (and the transactions are all linked to either mine or my bf's card). Good thing is I buy food, litter, treats and toys all in the same trip each time, so each receipt will show us spending about $50.00 each time.\n5. Contacted the vet to have them email us the vet bill, unfortunately found out that the account is under my mom's name and they won't change it without her approval, even though they are my cats. The bill for the cats, however, shows that my boyfriend paid the bill. The reason Kibble is under my mom's name in the system is because at that appt. we took my mom's dog with us and they checked us all in under the same name despite my saying to open a separate account. This is worrying me.\n6. Printed a dozen or so fliers and hung them in pet stores and grocery stores in our area, also at the senior apartments since the only info we're going off of is the new owner is an old woman who lives in an apt. and stays home all day. Makes sense she would be living in discounted senior facility. (Funnily enough, the woman at the reception desk told us she had seen our post in one of the Facebook groups! So word is spreading!) :)\n7. Called all the shelters, most were unhelpful. We'll need to go in person and look at the cats and give them photos, same thing with the vets. The issue is I work 3p-11p the next four days, my bf works 5p-10p the next four days so he will be able to do a lot of the ground work for me.\n\nFinally, after reading all of your comments, I have decided to shine my spine. I should have been more offended at the officer's comment and let him know it, too. I plan on calling the station back tomorrow (officer said he would call jnmom, then us, but hasn't yet) and telling them that I would like to go ahead and press charges unless jnmom tells us where the cats are. Time is really of the essence here. I didn't mention it in this post but you can read some of the backstory I posted on other subs. Basically Kibble has severe dietary restrictions, she has to eat a specific kind of dry/wet food and be fed on an exact schedule. If not she suffers from vomiting, diarrhea, bloating, gas and an obnoxious amount of hairballs. My mom didn't know this, therefore the new owner has no idea. I need to find her and get her back on her feeding routine before she gets sick.\n\nTL;DR EDIT: We did a lot today, I'm going to press charges unless my jnmom gives up the cat's whereabouts when the officer calls her.\n\nHere are our babies! Kibble is the floofy one and Bits is the crazy short hair. \nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/rgcTp4W\n\nEDIT2: JNmom messaged me and said \"cat rescue\" after I asked her where the cats were, my bf and I got really excited because it'd be a lot easier to find them from a shelter than a random stranger. Then she texted back to say she wasn't being serious, and I just lost it. For a few moments we felt like we were so close, I thought we would find our babies tomorrow.\n\nI just served her a replevin letter, giving her until 10/04 to provide us with our \"property\" or the information to the whereabouts of our property. I am calling to press charges tomorrow. I asked her if the officer had called her, she said no, I said \"well he'll be calling you tomorrow then\" and she said \"I'll be at work so I don't have to answer.\" She's basically realized how deep she's in and is trying to avoid legal confrontation. About twenty minutes before I delivered the letter, she texted me saying \"I love you\", then ten minutes ago she told me I need to move out and that she's changing the locks.\n\nI'm trying to keep hope, but it feels like it fades with every passing day. Will Kibble and Bits remember us? I feel like we're looking for a needle in a haystack. This strange woman, whose name we don't know, don't know her phone number or anything, is just out there somewhere. I'm hoping that by pressing charges we will be able to get the officer to obtain my mom's phone records and find the woman's phone number. Last update for tonight, boyfriend and I are going to try to relax. Thank you all for the well wishes, I'll let you know how things go tomorrow.\n\nEDIT3: I know I said I wouldn\u2019t update until tomorrow but I just had to. I\u2019ve been reading every new comment and I am just so fucking grateful for all of you. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. You are all amazing people and I love you all so much. \n\nMy bf just said something that I agree with: my mom made this too easy for me... she\u2019s just burying herself deeper and deeper. She blocked me on FB, I assume to convince herself she\u2019s got some control over the situation. I hope to god she changes the locks because I am going to call the police immediately. \n\nI was kind of afraid to press charges because like many of you pointed out, she\u2019s my mom. I shouldn\u2019t have to be pressing charges against my own mother. But seeing your perspective as someone on the outside has really opened my eyes. Another commenter said I need to stop thinking of her as my mom and start thinking of her as a stranger I\u2019d pass on the street. I\u2019ve taken that to heart. \n\nThank you again for all of the advice, every single piece of it was helpful. Repeated advice only reinforced important points to me. I hope you all have a great night.\n\n**For those interested for any legal advice/wanting to share my post, I live in Cincinnati Ohio. I\u2019m going to make a Facebook page tomorrow and share it with you all, if you could share the post.. someone out there *has* to \nknow this woman and recognize my cats.**\n\nEDIT4: Good morning everyone! Last night I had an awesome dream about my babies, the nightmare began when I woke up. I just showered, I\u2019m getting dressed and headed to the police station. Then to my egg donors house to follow some advice I received about cheking google\u2019s myactivity. I will make a new update post when I get back since these updates are getting pretty long. Wish me luck!\n\nEDIT5: At the police station right now, told the receptionist I didn\u2019t feel the officer yesterday took me very seriously and this is an urgent matter. \u201cNo disrespect, but can I speak to another officer?\u201d She said she understood and she was very kind. Waiting in the room right now. I\u2019m so nervous, I wish my bf was here.",

Also, just in case : I'm not looking for opinions on how I reacted, because I was fucking terrified and kept talking to the guy as I was afraid telling him to leave me alone would lead him to do much worse.\n\nI (18F) moved to a new, big city (well, big for me) from my tiny village for university. I live in a student residence and all is well.\nExcept yesterday, a man rang my doorbell. Long story short : I thought someone was ringing at the building's main entrance since it's supposed to be locked, I opened to door to go out and see who it was, turns out a 50 ish year old man was standing right outside my door. Seeing that he scared me, he then hugged me, and started a discussion about items he was supposedly selling (which I doubt, the guy only had one item of each which would be odd for a salesman). During the discussion, which I kept going because he was blocking my door and I was absolutely terrified, he hugged me multiple times, kissed my neck a dozen times and then touched my breasts to \"feel my heartbeat\". Anyway. Awful stuff, I still feel like shit, I know it is sexual assault but I'm still having trouble calling it that because it \"only happens to other people,\" I spent the night at a friend's house yesterday and yeah basically everything is not great but I'm lucky to have supportive people around me. I warned the people in charge of the residence and they have changed the locks to newer ones that actually close (the previous ones didn't half the time) and I'm thinking of pressing charges - all that to say that I HAVE talked about it to people.\n\nOne person, though, that I haven't told, is my dad (51). The mother of the friend I stayed with yesterday told me I should tell him and that he'd want to know - which, since she says it as a parent herself, carries a lot of weight. I know that I probably should, but I can't bring myself to it. I just don't want to worry him, and telling him that after barely a month alone his daughter got in a situation like that would definitely NOT put him at ease.\nSo how should I tell him ? Should I even tell him ? I know it's only been a day, even though it feels like fucking years already, but everyone is telling me he should know about it.",

I have known she started dating L while still married and we had a falling out years ago when I disagreed with the way she was handling it (he still doesn\u2019t know her \u201croommate \u201c is her girlfriend and my sister maintains that they are \u201cbetter friends now than they were married \u201c- which bothers me til no end).

She let my brother in law become godfather to my only child, while at the time knowing she wasn\u2019t going to stay in the relationship (I didn\u2019t know about L at the time). I was ok with waiting to discuss things until she came out on her own. But I\u2019m still waiting and honestly hate the position she has put me in.

I didn\u2019t come outright and tell anyone- but when they\u2019d ask me about her I didn\u2019t lie, I\u2019d just shut up or say it\u2019s not for me to tell. Eventually people figured it out and I didn\u2019t deny it. \n\nMy sister doesn\u2019t know who knows and no one really talks about it. No one cares to be honest. In my opinion she doesn\u2019t care about anyone knowing about her lesbian relationship- she\u2019s trying to save face and avoid ruining the perfect person act by admitting to being horrible to her husband, a really good person. \n\nI\u2019m just so fed up with tiptoeing! I want it out!!! My son adores her partner and we refer to her as Auntie L when we interact with her or discuss her- but if we are around family I have to curb the discussion or try to avoid him saying Auntie because sister is worried about people thinking about it too much or whatever.\n\nHow pissed will she be if I just tell her everyone knows and she needs to deal with it ?

She was the kind of woman who would invite a married man into the house and lock herself in the bedroom having sex the entire today and leave her young kids to fend for themselves. When he was 15 she disappeared for three days only to come back and say she got married and they were moving an hour away. He was VLC with her for many years after he turned 18. \n\nWhen I came into the picture I did my best to help with his issues surrounding his mom and then I got pregnant. When his mom found out I was pregnant she made comments about how we should of waited until we were married to have sex, whatever. \n\nShe wanted to be an active part of her grandchild\u2019s life so we \u201cdid the right thing\u201d (our first mistake) and let her. She pushed her way in and somehow we ended up seeing her Every. Single. Friday. She was overbearing, disrespectful, undermining and rude. She once shamed me in front of others for getting pregnant before I was married, but that\u2019s another story. \n\nWhen DD was 2.5 and DS was 6 months we asked her to babysit. When we got home we found out that she had invited her married boyfriend over and had him play with our kids. This was a man we had never met and knew absolutely nothing about. DH confronted her and she apologized and said she wouldn\u2019t let it happen again. She would still force the kids to talk to him on the phone every time she was around until she eventually stopped seeing him. After this incidence we became very hesitant to ever leave the kids alone with her. \n\nDH very unfortunately works in the same building as her and this has caused a multitude of problems (including MIL trying to set him up with a coworker who she referred to as her daughter). About a year ago MIL went to DH\u2019s boss and told her that she didn\u2019t get to see the kids enough (she was seeing them every Friday!) and we never let her babysit. \n\nThat night DH called MIL and confronted her about that and a few other inappropriate things she had done. Queue the tears and excuses. Nothing was her fault but all mine and my mother\u2019s fault. She was the poor innocent victim. We went LC and cut out the weekly visits. MIL talked to the kids weekly and saw them about once a month plus holidays. DD\u2019s birthday was shortly after the fight and MIL wasn\u2019t invited to join us for our usual day of birthday celebration (we go to the same place every year) but was invited to the party we had a few weeks later. \n\nA month or so ago we went to MIL\u2019s house and she spent most of the time on the phone whispering. The kids had been playing a game and she started picking it up. DS asked if they were going to finish the game and she said \u201cI think you are leaving soon\u201d. This was weird because she always extends visits as long as possible. So we leave and realize that there\u2019s a man in a truck waiting outside her house for us to leave. This was really annoying since she had whined to DH\u2019s boss about spending time with the kids and then cuts the visit short for this dude.\n\nThis year DH was very hesitant to invite MIL to DD\u2019s day of birthday celebration last week. She kept nagging incessantly (at work) and told him \u201cI will be there if you go no matter what even if it\u2019s last minute\u201d. Well the day of the guilt finally got the best of DH and he invited her. Her response? \u201cWe\u2019ll see\u201d.  Later that day she texts him and says that she has a boyfriend she\u2019s been seeing for over two years and she wants to bring him but only to part of it so the boyfriend isn\u2019t uncomfortable. This irritated the shit out of DH so he told her that it wasn\u2019t the right time and that the night was about DD and not about her.  He asked her not to come. So we go and are enjoying our time with our kids and she fucking shows up! DH and I were livid but kept cool for DD\u2019s sake. \n\nNow we find out that her boyfriend was on the news for drinking a fifth of vodka and crashing into his neighbor\u2019s fence. The video mentions that he has multiple DWIs and has been in jail for assault and battery on more than one occasion. He\u2019s homeless and an alcoholic who isn\u2019t currently seeking any treatment. MIL is now letting him live with her. We also found out that when we were out of town and she was house sitting and feeding, watering, and letting our dog in/out that she had him in our house and also took our dog to some hotel with her boyfriend. \n\nI had a very traumatic childhood with an abusive alcoholic father so I\u2019m sensitive to these situations. DH and I are very protective of our kids and this whole thing with MIL\u2019s boyfriend and her crashing DD\u2019s birthday is the final straw. We have decided to go full NC. DH texted her his feelings two days ago and told her she won\u2019t have contact with the kids and she never answered. \n\nBonus: the homeless, alcoholic boyfriend is 20 years younger than her. \n\nAre we doing the right thing in going NC?",

It\u2019s not an itch you can scratch. It\u2019s more of a stinging sensation. It feels like I\u2019m being stung all over my body. It\u2019s deep and the only thing that helps is to get cold.

It\u2019s debilitating.\n\nIt happens if I get warm/hot from just sitting or walking or showering. The hotter I get the more it stings.

  "self_text": "Dear fellow redditors \n\nRecently, my boyfriend has been feeling really depressed and down. And altough I have been suffering with depression and anxitey for what feels like half my life, I have no idea what to do because our coping strategies are fundamentally different. I myself am doing ok at the moment, but I absolutely know what depression and complete hopelessness feels like. And I want to help, but everything that always helped me seems to either not make a difference or make things worse, so I decided to come here for help, maybe some of you also cope like my bf, and can advise me on how to act. \n\nMy coping strategies are mostly social: I talk to people, and it\u2018s an immense help for me if ppl keep asking me how I am doing, and engage me in low pressure easy activities, like running errands or going out to grab some food. It helps my depression, if I feel connected to people, and I try to reach out. \n\nBut he\u2018s different: he gets very distant, and hardly texts at all (we\u2018re semi-long distance, and only meet up on weekends). When I keep asking how he\u2018s doing, or what I could do to help he either shuts me down or he\u2018ll get passive agressive, like I\u2018m annoying him with my questions. He also gets very fatalistic (\u201enothing matters anyhow\u201c). He also has trouble sleeping. He just somehow fights theough everyday life, and closes off completely. \n\nI am very humbled by this experience of being completely helpless and useless to him, because I always used to think I kind of knew how to deal with these emotions, because I\u2018ve felt them so often. \n\nDoes anyone know how to effectively be there for someone who shuts down and closes off? \n\nThank you guys, and I hope you are doing ok...",

  "self_text": " I started using meth in my senior year of college after finding out that I could buy drugs on -blank- using BC. I was trying to find adderall but it was way too expensive and found some alternatives (you guessed it meth). My mother and sister use to use and I have an addictive personality. I got around 90 pills of 2 different kinds and only took them orally since I was scared/wouldn't ever do it smoking or shooting, although I smoked weed. I don't even remember the first time I got high and what it felt like but it made the simplest of things feel like the best feeling in the world. Working on homework, cleaning, watching videos, anything really. One thing that never happened to me was being addicted to porn or even liking it when I was on meth like most people. Contrary to belief, meth did NOT help me in school and made it much worse cause I would focus on dumb shit like making the perfect study guide or the perfect excel sheet. I would never stay up for more than 36 hours and would drink lots of Gatorade, vitamins, and try to eat. I felt like I lost my self and felt like a zombie while I was on it, which I did everyday until I ran out. I would have terrible comedowns where my brain literally felt like it was melting and buzzing so terrible I wanted to go to the emergency room. I didnt though cause I didn't want anyone to know I was doing meth and until this day I'm 99 percent sure no one does know I did. I stopped after I ran out and never ordered more from the web even though I was a \"fiend\" for a few days. I still til this day see things/shadows out the outside of my vision. It took awhile for my brain to get back to it's normal self and it felt shitty doing anything because I would get 0 satisfaction from it. I turned to eating and drinking alcohol (which is just as bad) and gain 80 pounds in 8 months to cope. Finished college and resumed life while still thinking about the little secret I keep to myself and have never told anyone and probably never will except here. I go on and off of alcohol and struggle with it sometimes but it's the price I paid for doing this drug. I don't judge people that have or still use this drug but wish them the best if they wish to quit this terrible drug. Just wanted to get this off my chest and share this secret i've kept for 2 years.

This is an autoflower with caramelly-sweet flavor, indica-dominant. \n\nI don't have exact numbers but first time it was only about 2.5 month from seed to harvest. It had typical indica body warmth effect but was quite energizing. Also very potent. Few times I smoked too much and had typical \"too high\" with herat beating fast, stroboscope effect, sounds sampling and even some visuals. Sometimes it felt a bit harsh, like it's so strong it's hard to breathe. It had very clear head high effect like sativa.\n\nSecond time it was month longer on flowering about 3.5 month, maybe slightly more, I already tried a bit and effect changed dramaticly. Fist of all it reminded me typical indica. Ver-very potent, probably one of the strongest stuff I ever smoked. It became drowsy and kinda like amnesiac. I fell into the state I'm not entierly sure where I am, my short term memory is turned off, but I feel good and don't care much about it. \n\nThe thing is usually if I get this high it gets at lest uncomofortable. Heart is beating fast, it's harder to breathe, I can even get paranoid. But this time no signs of paranoia or physical discomfort whatsoever! It obliterated me and I was totaly ok with it.

The last time he attempted he slit his throat using a box cutter in front of me. It was horrific. I remember seeing the exposed adipose tissue between the blood before I threw a towel on it to apply pressure. I made plans for how I was going to get him out of the bathtub in case I needed to do CPR. I stared at his eyes and repeated \u201cI love you\u201d over and over. Mostly I screamed. I have never been so scared. So heartbroken.\n\nIt took hours of surgery to repair the damage. Because of my own mental stability, I decided to stay away for a while. I thought, surly, this time they would admit him to a long-term facility. Clearly the whole \u201ctake these meds and show up to this place once a week\u201d wasn\u2019t working. But then, one week after the incident, I got a phone call from his social worker: let him come home or he is homeless. In-patient wasn\u2019t an option. He was uninsured. \n\nIt flabbergasts me how our system works. Take a person who is so burned out from life, who doesn\u2019t have enough energy most days to even get out of bed and tell them that they need to be responsible in order to get better. Certainly, I am not the only one who finds this laughable? In all three of his attempts, I pressed the doctors and social workers about HOW this was going to be properly treated. All three times it was the same: \u201cTake these meds\u201d \u201cGo to therapy.\u201d Cool. The problem is, because he doesn\u2019t have insurance, he cannot go to follow up appointments. He cannot afford quality therapy. And because he is mentally ill, he doesn\u2019t have the motivation to. \n\nThe system throws us back into this continuous loop: he gets bad. He refuses to get out of bed some days. He drinks to numb his pain. He doesn\u2019t have the motivation to fix anything. He cannot afford to go to quality therapy and the free therapy available is not consistent. He tries to die. They hold him for one week. He is still bad. He still doesn\u2019t have the motivation to fix anything. He still cannot afford to go to quality therapy. Now he doesn\u2019t trust the healthcare professionals because they haven\u2019t done anything. He tries to die again.\n\nI often hear people say, \u201cit is his choice.\u201d Well, yes, to an extent. I personally think about his mental illness as a continuous torture. It hurts. Living HURTS. Some days are worse than others. It leads to him essentially being \u201cburned out\u201d from life. If you are burned out from your job, you can quit. You can take a vacation. There is no vacation in life. However, you can quit life. If you go to your work day in and day out and are told by your manager \u201cthis job *might* get better if you put in all of this unpaid overtime in addition to the work that you already do not have the motivation to do,\u201d would YOU bother?

It's just bad smelling and leaves a taste on my mouth that's also bad. \n\n\nHow can I be sure that it's not just me and how can I bring this up to her without worrying her?",

  "self_text": "My best friend and I met at college last year in August and became really close and would hang out just the two of us a lot, despite having mutual good friends. We have a ton in common, both values and interests. In December, I told him I liked him, he didn't feel the same way and we moved on. Spring semester we got even closer but everyone was convinced we were dating. In particular, I ran into one of his friends somewhere who I had only talked to a few times and she thought we were together. This semester has felt very similar- we do very couple like things. However, this week he's been saying things in front of guys I casually flirt with that seem like he's trying to prove that he knows me better than them. The information he shares isn't super private but not many people know and I'm not sure if I necessarily want others to know. I'm not going to tell him how I feel again, but what can I do to either get him to back off and just be my best friend or act? I honestly don't care which he does but I hate being in the awkward middle between friends and dating and not knowing what he wants out of our friendship.",

I mean, of course shoes allow us to traverse on a level of comfort that we would not otherwise achieve, but it also disconnects us from the Here and Now of where we are.\n\n  It's a personal opinion, but when I'm at a festival or just out walking my dog around the block, I try to go barefoot as much as possible.  It grounds me, literally, and is a constant reminder of where I actually am.  Instead of existing in the insular world of my own thoughts and feelings, being in contact with the planet helps me feel less separated and unsure of myself and the world around me.\n\n  I, and we, are a part of something huge.  My ego wants to be separate, unique... But placing each step with calm, accepting, deliberate intention helps me dissolve the boundary of Self and Other.  We're all parts of the same thing, and in a time of so much hustle, anxiety, and stress, it's been a boon to my soul to simply drop all expectations for the duration of a walk, and just exist, one with everything while feeling the simple joy of a living planet beneath my feet.",

It's funny that I thought I was the insecure one, but I love who I am. I actually pity her. I don't think she'll ever find true happiness. I don't think anything will ever be good enough for her.

  "self_text": "Background. My sister is on long-term sickleave due to mental illness. Our mom died 2,5 years ago and it was really hard on all of us. She's been staying with my family (boyfriend and reenage son) and I for 1,5 years before getting her own flat 25 km from the town where we live. We were also hosting her 2 kids every other weekend, her boyfriend most of the time and a parrot. Imagine the sound levels in our 2 bedroom apartment. It didn't work out due to the kids being too noisy after my nightshifts, and she broke up with her so before moving out.  Now she's alone every other week. \n\nHer financial situation sucks and we help her out in the range of 300 to 1300 dollars a month, stillshe's short on loney. Not her fault and she hates being dependant on me but we are glad to help so she can have her own place and see her kids more often. \n\nMy health isn't much better, though while she suffers mentally I suffer physically. I have thyroidism, endometriosis, abdominal afhesions and fatigue. I'm having major surgery in a couple of weeks  and I'm looking forwards to the bed rest... \n\nHolding down my job is a constant struggle and like all of us I still need to do house chores and look after my family. My social life is close to zero because I lack the time and energy for it. \n\nMy sleep schedule is seriously screwed up. I come home from work at 06.15 and depending on whether I take sleeping pills or not I fall asleep between 7 and 10 and usually wake up before 2. Ok n the rare caseI can go back to sleepI might sleep until 4. \n\nMy boyfriend often takes me to abd from work because he's afraid to have me driving so exhausted. \n\nI always feel like shit when Iwake up (nausea, achy, groggy and non-coherent). It takes a couple of hours for me to be somewhat functioning and a couple more to feel social. I HATE being waken up. \n\nNow to my problem! I don't feel that my sister respects the fact that I need as much sleep as possible. She often asks to come hang out on times that work her her but are  terrible to me. Yesterday we had basically this exchange via text; \n\nHer (H) \"Hey, I have a meeting at 11 tomorrow and I'm seeing someone at 3, can I hang out at yours?\"\n\nMe (M) \" Ok if you're quiet as I'm doing my 4 nights in a row starting tonight.\" \n\nH \"I'll be quiet but can I wake you up at 2.30?\" \n\nM \"I'd rather you didn't\"\n\nH \"Ok.\" \n\nDriving back and forth would cost her extra time and money so I feel that I must oblige.\n\nToday  I wake up at 12.30 because she's coughing... Still she doesn't understand but goes on asking me if she can come by at 10 on friday.  These situations come up maybe twice a month.\n\nShe fucking KNOWS i'm sleep deprieved as it is. Sometimes I just want to implement visiting hours... I've tried talking about me being tired, unwell and not getting enough sleep but she seems to ignore the fact that I need to be left alone during daytime. If I get harsher I'm afraid it will cause a set-back in her mental health (whick includes paranoia) and our relationship. She is the best person but she can get real butthurt! \n\nAnyways... Leaving for work in a couple of minutesand it's going to be a rough one.  Maybe I just needed to vent. \n\nAny insights? \n\nBtw not a native speaker and my eyesight is poor from being tired so I'm sorry for any errors.",

Imagine me like a game character on a high level but one stat is still at level 1: dating. \n\nMy problem: I like my LDR girlfriend, i love her a little but not enough to marry her, we had great times over the last 2 years and did cool shit, Im sure we would still have fun for the few times we see each other every year, even 2 years from now..  And we have a connection.  Now the most unlikely and rare thing happened to me: For years ive never crushed on anyone, but now i did. I started college and this girl goes to the same classes as i do. I got pretty interested immeditately the first day, i sadly forgot her name though. \n\nShe seems kinda interested too but i could also be wish thinking. Like for example i say good morning when entering the class and even though we never talk she replies to me as almost the only one in the class.. \n\nNow I am torn apart between what to do. I cant know if i would get along with this nameless girl and I dont want to betray my girlfriend. \n\nI could do this: Attempt to get to know the nameless girl in a purely friendly manner and not tell my LDR girlfriend. But then i might hurt LDR girlfriend more later, if i actually start something with nameless girl and break up with LDR. OR i ignore the crush and keep my LDR where i know ill be happy 1/12th of the year but lonely 11/12th. And I am pretty attached to LDR gf, she is also my best friend and we chat every day. \n\nI am also afraid that I would regret a break up with ldr gf. Or perhaps i would break up ldr, get with nameless girl but still think about my ldr gf and then the relationship with nameless girl would be kinda eh.. bad. \n\nBut I am also thinking nameless girl is a shot at a girlfriend i could stay with possibly forever. Big wish thinking here. \n\nThe whole thing has a time limit..  LDR gf wants to visit me after or around christmas and i dont want her to come for nothing..  and nameless girl will eventually find a boyfriend (if she does not have one already anyways) and in a 1,5 yrs wont have shared classes with me or might drop out of college like 40-50% of people do.. \n\nSo i don't know what to do. And i would not really know HOW to go by the option of getting to know nameless girl, some ideas would be great..   I seem unable to get random easy opportunities here.. We never walk out of the class at the same time, she mostly goes around with her friends and i mostly go around with mine and we dont have mututal friends. \n\nhelp me out here Im stuck",

  "self_text": "Mid 20s HL male currently in a DB with mid 20s LL female that's gotten pretty bad for me (4 PIV sex over the last year) and I'm having a hard time talking to my SO about my feelings. Sex was great initially in the relationship but quickly tanked over the past 5 years. We've had the talk a few times in the past couple months and she is understanding and willing to make the situation better. She's admitted there's a problem and is doing her best to make things go in the right direction. She's never expressed to me that she feels pressured for sex and she assures me that I'm accommodating to her sexual boundaries. She tells me she actively thinks about our DB and feels sorry that it's gotten this far. We haven't done any form of therapy yet, as she feels this is something that we can likely sort out ourselves.\n\nHere's my issue other than the lack of sex. I feel like I have no one to talk to. I don't want to express my emotions to my SO because they're very dark and I don't want to put pressure on her to give me intimacy that she doesn't want to give. It feels like parts of my soul are being flayed from my body with every passing week that goes sexless. There is only one single person on this entire planet that I want, yet she doesn't want to love me back in the same ways that I want to love her. My psychological and emotional health feel irreversibly damaged from the lack of sensual depth that's egregiously unfulfilled. I don't feel that I could ever initiate sex again for fear of rejection or sex that is grossly dutiful.\n\nDo I just express all my feelings to my SO? If she ever felt even a fraction of this way about our relationship, then I would personally want her to tell me, but I fear this will only scare her into giving me sex that she doesn't really want to give. Do I express only some of my feelings without going into the really deep stuff just to let her know that I'm really REALLY not okay? Or do I just shut my mouth and throw on a smile while I die inside? Should I just go see a therapist and spill my guts to them instead? I'm not sure how much longer I can do this before I just toss together an exit plan and run for the hills. I've been patient for a while now as we both try to work this out, but I truly can't help how I feel. How is it that I'm in a relationship with someone, but I'm so scared to share my feelings with them? If I speak, I fear pushing her away. If I don't speak, I'm pushing myself away.\n\nSorry if this is ranty, but I enjoyed typing this out to get it off my chest. I'd really love to hear how you all deal with carrying around this sort of baggage. Bettering myself with school and fitness can only can get my mind off the issue for so long. It hurts badly.",

  "author": "Punkrockit",
  "self_text": "Just to give some info: I'm a 24 year old woman. My highest weight was 319.67 lbs (145kg). I lost weight fairly slowly over time (about 1.5-2 years) due to medication which didn't really leave me with loose skin at all - sort of like the weight loss went slow enough that my skin could keep up, I suppose. At the end of April, when I was about 253 lbs (114.8 kg) I started counting calories to actively start losing weight. I'm now at 216 lbs (98kg) and I have a LOT of loose skin. It's especially bad around my thighs and my belly, but I also have some on my buttocks and arms. My mom has always said that she believes that the loose skin would go away on its own, especially if I lost weight this side of 25, but with the amount that I have already without being even anywhere near my goal, I'm seriously beginning to doubt that.\nI would love to hear from you guys, especially if you are or were similar to me in age when you lost weight. How much weight did you lose, how much loose skin did you have, how much went away on its own? Did you do anything to try and fight the skin, like apply creams or eat certain foods? Did you have to have surgery to remove excess skin in the end?\nLosing weight has been great, but having so much loose skin already is honestly demotivating and I don't like seeing it. Anything you guys could tell me about your own experiences would be helpful! Thank you!",

  "author": "anonstdthrowaway",
  "self_text": "This incident happened in India. I (male) had sex with a commercial sex worker (female) on July 21st 2019. It involved penetrative vaginal sex, titty fuck, and body to body massage. Also I sucked on her boobs. I wore a condom for the vaginal sex but didn't not have a condom on during the body to body massage when my dick could have come in contact with her vaginal fluids. Also I'm not sure if the condom slipped or broke during sex as it was my first time and I was very overwhelmed. The next day I became very paranoid about contracting HIV and consulted a sexologist (professionally qualified) who put me on PEP (Post exposure prophylaxis). I took the medicine for approximately 14-16 days after which I discontinued as I couldn't bear the side effects. Approximately 3 weeks after the incident I got sore throat, cold and cough which went away in a few days. A month after the incident I noticed a bit of a thrush on my tounge which was accompanied by bad breath. Also had a bit of a cold and cough during this period. I was also going through severe HIV anxiety during this period and couldn't not concentrate on my everyday tasks and work. Was very stressed out and connected everything that happened to me with HIV. After a while I started getting itchy rash like pimples on my forearms (10-15 pimples like bumps on each hand which when squeezed results in a transparent discharge). The pimples healed over time but new ones keep coming up till this day. This made me extremely paranoid and I got a HIV duo 4th gen test done on September 10th (1 month 20 days after the incident) which came back negative. Also I got an antibodies test done on September 12th (1 month 22 days after the incident) which also came back negative. When I spoke with the sexologist he told me that the results are upto 95% accurate but aren't conclusive before a period of 3 months. As I couldn't control my HIV anxiety I got a HIV 1 PCR RNA Qualitative test done on 22nd September (2 months after the incident) which again came back negative. But the incident happened in India where HIV 2 is also present but not as prevalent as HIV 1. I don't think the PCR test checks for HIV 2. But the rash like pimples still keep coming up and I got a small patch of tinea versicolor (fungal infection) on the backside of my torso. How likely is it that I have been infected by HIV? And what is the accuracy of the test results mentioned above? Should I be worried? PLEASE HELP!! the past 1-2 months have been very stressful and I'm not able to do anything in life apart from worrying about HIV. ANY HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED!!

  "author": "brkupthrwyy",
  "self_text": "Henry and I have been together a little over a year. We met in university, on the same course, friends for a while. In the beginning I just wanted a hook up but we feel for each other hard.\n\nThe first few months were lovely, obviously. 6 months after we got together, I left for a few months' study exchange on the other side of the world. \n\nHe freaked out about the distance and wanted to break up just before I left, even though he said he loved me, (\"because it would be better than us breaking up when you're away\"). We stayed together, but the distance was difficult: I handled it by being a little too needy, he handled it by burying himself in work and being distant. There were many moments where I told him I couldn't tell if he cared about me, or that I felt I was putting in the most effort. \n\nHe joined me abroad during my last month and we traveled together. Half the time was sweet and warm, everything I wanted, half the time was stressful arguing like we've never argued before. \n\nI got back to our university city a month ago. I was hoping everything would settle and be like those first few months. But we keep arguing. About stupid, tiny things. And it breaks my heart because I don't know how we got here.\n\nHe can be the sweetest, most caring person if I'm sad or sick. But it's also become clear to me that overall, I put in more effort than him. I like to do cute things for him -- hand-make a present, send him a random gift during the distance, made him a playlist of our songs. He helps me out in practical ways, promises me things that are late or don't turn up; he didn't even get me a birthday present during long distance. I've told him about the effort imbalance many times and he assures me he loves me and will try, and then nothing ever changes.\n\nThere's also a problem with communication. These last few days when we've been arguing I try and stay calm. I ask a lot of questions to understand his point of view. But he just gets angry and frustrated and even yelled at me the other day. He'll be pissy or off with me when he could communicate the same thing in a neutral or positive way, and then we end up arguing.\n\nI'm not saying I'm a perfect girlfriend. Sometimes I'm too clingy or needy. But I try hard to be aware and to communicate maturely. Sometimes he won't tell me things that bother him, and instead make a snarky comment rather than just communicating with me. His outlook on life is so negative and fixed. And it's driving me insane. \n\nI am 90% sure I need to break up with him. This relationship is not serving my or his needs. But I love him so much. He's my second love, the reason I finally stopped being cynical about relationships. He understands me, my (our) sense of humour and introvert nature and all the rest. Even just practically, it'll hurt to break up because we'll see each other all the time in university, mutual friends, etc. He's so embedded in my life. He looked after my plants while I was away. His mum is so sweet and we get on well. I even promised my grandma she'd get to meet him next time I visit her. I need to break up with him but it's so painful. \n\n\nTL;DR: Relationship with my boyfriend of one year has become unhealthy and I don't see it changing. I love him so much it feels impossible to break up with him, but I know it needs to be done. How to break up?",

Lately, we've been discussing my mom, since now it is obvious where my trauma and coping mechanisms come from.\n\nI'm currently starting NC/VLC with my uBPD mom. I asked my therapist what I should do regarding the upcoming holidays. I explained that I usually tried to include my mom in some way by visiting her or facetiming her, but its never enough. I told my therapist that I did not want to see or contact my mom for the holidays this year. She said that if I didn't want to see my mom for the holidays, she completely supported that, but thought I had an obligation to tell her.\n\nI got very defensive. I asked why the burden was on me. I told her that I didn't want to reach out to her at all. I said that my mom should be the one reaching out to me. I told her that if my mom wanted to see me for the holidays, she should come begging on her knees and apologizing to me.\n\nShe said, \"How would you feel if you and your boyfriend had plans, and then you just changed them without saying anything?\"\n\nHmm, I don't know, did I abuse my boyfriend for 20 years? Because if he changed plans without saying anything after I made his life a nightmare for 2 decades, I think I could wager a guess as to why he's withdrawing from me.\n\nWe were about halfway through the session at this point. I felt so angry and ignored and invalidated and like I wanted to switch therapists.\n\nBut then my therapist asked me if absolute no contact was my goal. She said she would 100% support me in this if it was my goal. I said that yes, I honestly wish that my mom was just dead and would leave me alone. So she said 'Okay, then block her number and email.' I told her that I wasn't ready.\n\nShe explained that she agreed that I wasn't ready. She said that she worried if I just cut my mom off 100% right now, that there were risks that I would feel too guilty and this could hurt my progress. She said that she has my best interests in mind and that only I can decide what to do and when to do it. She then thanked me for listening to her and giving her more information when I got defensive instead of just ending the conversation. She said that I didn't have a lot of examples of 'healthy disagreement' growing up, but that our session today was good instance of just that.\n\nOverall, I left the session feeling okay. We agreed that around the holidays, my mom will be the one to reach out to me. Then, I will evaluate what she's said and either respond or not respond based on how stable or abusive she is. Are these signs of a good therapist, or should I be concerned? Anyone have similar experiences?",

What makes this complicated is that I am religious and I will be starting college in a year. I stayed home from college this year because I had anxiety about going and the finances just weren't there. So having to deal with the fear of leaving home and going to an unfamiliar place is stressing me now even though its a year away. I also don't think I should date someone if ill be leaving the state in a year. I also don't want to go to college with a boyfriend because if I meet someone at college I don't want to feel tied down back home. \n\nI also feel bad thinking about dating this guy because of my religion. I am a Christian, a baptist to be specific, and from what he has said, he has a catholic background. The bible says we shouldn't date or be with someone who doesn't share our beliefs, and I agree with this-- how can two walk together except they are agreed? Also, my parents have always told me to wait on dating and all.  I would not only be nervous to ask them (my parents) if I could date someone but also if that person wasn't even in our Christian bubble-- I don't even see them considering it. I \n\nAll I can think that could solve this a little is just inviting him to church and keeping it casual unless he decides to become a Christian for the right reasons and all. I don't want to be the motivating factor that brings him to God, because that's not how it should work. Am I just being naive to think this way?

She\u2019s gotten an in depth look into my background, family, and relationship dynamics, I feel. \n\nI\u2019m looking for a therapist that is going to provide me with homework, and tips as I go along to help me feel like I\u2019m making progress. \n\nAm I being impatient and should I wait this out? \nShe\u2019s mentioned she needs to get to know me to better assess and provide recommendations, but the lack of homework and feedback along the way doesn\u2019t sit well with me. \n\nWhat are some progress markers for those who have gone through therapy? \n\nWhat were signs of bad chemistry with your therapist?\n\nWhat are things that are important?\n\nTIA.",

Everything that I\u2019m missing and that I will miss because I choose to drink.\n\nI drink every night, and have for probably the past 8 years. Most nights I will put away 10-12 beers by myself.

I have a very stressful job in healthcare (ironically enough), and again rationalize my use with the need to calm down and drink to be at ease. It\u2019s become much more than that and I am so scared that I can\u2019t stop it.\n\nI went through a rough breakup last year which fueled me to think it was ok to treat the pain I experience. But I know that it is not. \n\nI am hurting myself in so many ways that I haven\u2019t fully come to term with both physically and psychologically and a part of me is screaming to get help before I am  in deeper than I already am. \n\nI don\u2019t know where to start, and especially how to stop.

I was offered sooo many different beverages, and I turned them down with no hesitation. I had so much fun Saturday night, I was clear headed and totally in control of all my factions, and I was able to dance with my friends, and able to twirl my LED baton without a hitch. I impressed a lot of people with my twirling and that felt good considering I am not the person who likes to be in the spotlight.  Anyways, after my boyfriend's DJ set, we start to pack up and go back home because we have dogs at home. I am thirsty for water and I see my best friend's water bottle on my furniture pad we were all laying on ... I take a sip and immediately I recognize the poisonous taste of vodka. I spit it out immediately and spit out all the residual in my mouth. This is not going to restart my counter dangit. I just have to be more careful and on my guard!

First of all, I am a little annoyed because he lied to me and \"played\" me. He led me on without telling me there was someone else.

  "self_text": "I have struggled with severe anxiety and insecurity around my appearance for the last four years. The problems started when I was in my second year at college and I felt depressed because I wasn't as skinny/thin as some of the girls, although I wasn't even what I would describe as fat and no one ever told me I was fat or joked about my weight .over the past six months or so I have still felt incredibly uncomfortable and insecure around my appearance but over the last week things have deteriorated significantly for me to believing that my presence on this planet is not required and that I wouldn't be a significant loss for anyone , I would just be another number in the list of people who have commited suicide . It doesn't matter how many positivity accounts I visit on social media , nothing sinks in permanently, if I look at a post representing body and appearance positivity the information will be absorbed for mabye a couple of minutes and then it is wiped clean from my memory bank. I am sick and exhausted of constantly feeling inferior whenever I see any girl who has a thinner face than me , a smaller body size/shape than me, a more symmetrical face than me etc. I don't understand why I can't just be whatever size I want to , eat whatever I like and look the way I was supposed to be naturally without having to opt for plastic surgery just to please people or make other people feel attracted to me . It feels quite surreal because people know that I'm going through a bad anxiety phase at the moment , but no one really knows that I'm semi-suicidal and im extremely scared that no one will actually realize something isn't quite right untill I attempt something -I am also at a local organization in town and I'm one of the most senior students there so I also feel a certain degree of pressure to keep a stable , \"perfect\" role model image for the younger students and I also feel like because there is a huge increase in the amount of people who go there now , that I won't be able to find the time to sit down with someone and discuss the situation with them. I feel like everyone in close contact with me knows that I'm ugly, they may not have told me to my face but I feel that just through their body language and the responses they use when I talk to them that it's fairly clear that they think I'm physically ugly-p.s.i have self harmed but I'm trying to resist the urge",

Im sorry if there will be confusion with terms and words as english not my first langauage, but i will try my best. \n\nFor context, we are southeast asians living abroad. And living with your parents over 18 is normal. \nHe has been working here since 2007, and he got me a visa to live and work here with him just last week. Our relationship since has been ok, but not that close with my mother (weve been with her since birth until 2014). Now theyre separated and has their own families. \n\nNow, before I got here, i had no job and had little money. Now that im living with him and my stepmother,i feel like they are treating me like a 12 year old girl. I do not dress up and put make up unless needed, but they are forcing me to do so. They want me to sleep and wake up a certain time. They want me to eat what they want me to eat. They want me to reduce wearing my headset because it causes my headaches. \n\nThe other day, they want to buy some clothes for me, because 'I needed clothes'. Now, the primary reason I came to live with them is to have bigger opportunity so I can support my grandparents and my sister at our homecountry. (This is how he supported us since he worked here.) He still supports them financially but as of now, he 'has bills and loans to pay off' so he is cutting off financial supports, especially as he just got me a visa to live here. (it costs a lot..) Now, am feeling guilty and controlled that they will buy me expensive clothes that 'they' like, which couldve been sent to our family financially instead. Now, I thought, its their money so I cant complain and I just have to endure.\n\nI was keeping these to myself up until now. I was editing some stuff I filmed here. (its for my vlog), and then they were asking me to turn it off because i cant stay up too late. I already said I cant postpone this tomorrow, and they went bananas. I shouted too that I felt controlled and shouldve been a robot instead. They said all of these was for my sake and 'upgrade' my life. Thats what I was trying to tell myself but I cant help but feel like a child with no freedom at all.\n\nthank you and i appreciate your time.\n\nTL DR; my father and stepmom treats me like a child, or thats at least what i feel\n\nnote: i am in the middle of processing my documents so i can land a job here.",

  "author": "ThrowRA12123",
  "self_text": "So, this is more than just an unrequited crush. I\u2019m a freshman in college and have only been in this state (nebraska) since august. I met this guy on Tinder like 3 weeks we both go to the same college, and have pretty similar interests. After talking on snapchat for a few days we went out for coffee and ended up talking for four and a half hours. We really hit off, I think we had great chemistry and a lot in common. We wanted to see each other again, so the next day I went over to his house to watch a movie and ended up hooking up. Afterwards we were talking and he said he wasn\u2019t interested in any kind of relationship. This was surprising and definitely not what I wanted to hear. The super long coffee date made me think he wanted more than just a hookup. But whatever, right? He said he wanted to be friends but I took that w a grain of salt, figured that was probably it. Then he kept texting me.\n\nOver the course of just a few days, he texted me so much (and called me and snapped me) that I thought he maybe was interested. We met up to eat at the dining halls, and talked all the time. He also wanted to have a movie marathon at his house. I ended up developing a pretty serious crush on this guy, something that doesn\u2019t normally happen for me. But he was cute and nice and honestly just really interesting, and I thought he liked me back, given how much we talked.\n\nLast friday we were talking, and I thought he wanted a movie night but we\u2019d both had royally shitty days so I wasn\u2019t about to suggest it. He suggested I come over late that night and I was all for it, then he remembered his roommates were having people over so that night wouldn\u2019t work. I was disappointed but figured, whatever, we\u2019ll do it another time. I then go out with my friends and party, and get pretty wasted. I text him while at the party and I (rather drunkenly) tell him I\u2019d rather be with him and when he asks why I say \u201cI like youuuuuu.\u201d This goes unanswered and unacknowledged. Makes drunk me very sad. When I get home at like 2:30am he\u2019s still awake so I call him, and after a while end up asking him what he wants from me. He says again that he doesn\u2019t want a relationship, he only wants to be friends. This is really upsetting to me, and I ask him why he talked to me so much then, why I got mixed signals from him. He said that he talked to me after because he felt bad about only wanting a hookup. This was really upsetting, I cried, and he apologized a lot. I got off the phone around 4am and didn\u2019t talk or text him at all. (this was friday night). I didn\u2019t talk to him all day saturday, and sunday morning I woke up to an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d text from him and \u201cI don\u2019t know how to express it.\u201d I haven\u2019t responded at all.\n\nI know its not his fault that I like him and he doesn\u2019t like me, but I can\u2019t help feeling hurt. The question is, do I keep talking to him, or cut off communication? I already miss talking to him, and he\u2019s one of the best friends I have here. I really struggle making friends and given that I\u2019m going to school more than 1,000 miles away from home, I feel like I can\u2019t afford to lose him as a friend. So, should I keep talking to him, or cut off contact so I don\u2019t get more hurt?\n\nEDIT: I don\u2019t think he wants to hookup more, he just wants to be friends now",

My partner has been with girls previously and was always open to me about it and how she still is bisexual.

Our life was on track and we had the best family and we both thought we hit the best point in our relationship. Then, two weeks ago is imploded slightly and I had no idea why.\n\nIt resulted in me moving out to my parents for a week without knowing what was really going on, after the week we caught up and had a chat. She said she\u2019s been feeling more attracted to women and she\u2019s starting to question, she said she\u2019s confused. She also told me she loves me like crazy and is still madly attracted to me and still finds me sexually attractive.\n\nI love my girlfriend and I am supporting her through this, we have taken a little break for her to try and think about what she wants (in that time she\u2019s invited me around to stay, she\u2019s currently asleep next to me). We have had sex, but she still doesn\u2019t know what she wants to do, she says she thinks she wants to try and make this work.\n\nI\u2019m here because I\u2019m madly in love with this girl and would love to continue our amazing relationship. I\u2019m here because I\u2019m after advise on how to handle this and for peoples experiences in similar situations to hopefully help me understand how this could end up and how to be the best partner I can through this time.\n\nIn a nutshell, she feels like she is becoming more sexually attracted to other women, she says their isn\u2019t anyone else and she isn\u2019t looking. She just doesn\u2019t know what she wants.\n\nI\u2019ve said to her that it\u2019s ok for her to feel attraction towards women if she still loves me we can make it work. I\u2019ve also said if she wants we can see other people for a while while she explores (she didn\u2019t want to do this as she can\u2019t handle the thought of me with someone else). I\u2019ve also mentioned bringing another woman into our bedroom but she said she thinks she\u2019ll get jealous of me watching the other woman.\n\nSo bisexuals and lesbians of reddit or people who have been in similar situations, help me understand and be the best partner and friend I can be.\n\nThankyou in advance everyone",

  "self_text": "So basically, I separated from my girlfriend about a month ago because I went to college. It was a super amicable separation, and we've stayed in touch, communicating basically every day. A couple weeks after our separation, I started getting really bad anxiety that she was going to have sex with my cousin (who is three years younger than us). In my mind, he's objectively more attractive than me, and they already kinda had a bond because of me. When I brought up those feelings to my ex, she was not only offended but confused why I would even think that, which I totally understand. At the time, it was a totally baseless accusation. The conversation finally came to the point of me asking her not to have sex with him, and she eventually agreed. The way she put it, she \"wasn't going to have sex with my 15 year old cousin, because of course I won't,\" which I accepted. Of course, the anxiety stayed there but it was less.\nA couple days ago, they were sending me pictures of them hangin out, and of course my anxiety kicked in and I started asking my cousin for pictures of himself (because I missed him of course). I was afraid that they were going behind my back and fucking anyways, but I *knew* that they weren't. That night, he stayed over at her house and slept on the couch, so I thought that they hadn't done anything. Then, over this weekend, she said she had something she wanted to tell me. I was kinda expecting her to say that she had sex with someone, but I had out the possibility of it being my cousin out of my head. Unfortunately, it turned out that my cousin had confessed to her that he found her attractive, and of course she finds him attractive. They deliberated and commiserated if they wanted to act on those feelings, and she told him about what I had asked of her. I asked if they had done anything, and she said no. Later, after this call, I called my cousin to talk about it with him, and he said that they did do something; they had kissed. I was very distraught and confused as to why she wouldn't tell me. The next day, I called her and explained my new information. She said she didn't wanna tell me because she was afraid I'd get mad, which is fair. Then, she tells me that not only had they kissed, but that they had almost had sex. They made out, they undressed each other, and he put on a condom. Only issue was, he couldn't get hard after putting the condom on (at least that's what she said, my anxiety is trying its hardest to convince me that they actually went through with it). After this happened, she said, they decided to put a stopper on it until she could talk to me about it and get my opinion on it; if I said I wasn't chill with it, they wouldn't, but if I was, they would. Obviously I wasn't. According to her, as soon as I said no, the option was off the table for her, and same for my cousin. I'm just having a really, really difficult time convincing myself that it's true. Also like, I know she isn't mine anymore and I don't own her or control who she fucks, but in this particular situation, I had asked her very deliberately (not forced, asked) to not have sex with him, which she agreed to. She almost broke that trust. Idk really how to end this, basically, any thoughts?",

The other night we attempted having sex for the first time in a couple weeks and even with all of the kissing/stimulation/fellatio in the world he could not get erect. I've always had a high-*er* sex drive, but while mine hasn't really changed his has been obliterated. He says he never feels aroused and even while having sex has very minimal sensation. I thought maybe it was just a psychological issue and something we could work on together, in particular I've encouraged him to start seeing a therapist once he can save up some money. \n\nEarlier today, though, I read something on another sub that basically scalped me, \"Also: pay attention to when your body says NO. Your brain lies to you...if you\u2019re having sex with someone consistently, and you find that you are never aroused or never as into it or don\u2019t have the same drive as them, it\u2019s a *sign*. Sometimes it\u2019s not that you don\u2019t like sex as much as others, sometimes it\u2019s just that your body doesn\u2019t like having sex with *them*. And it tells you in subtle ways.\"\n\nHe always assures me that he's attracted to me and wouldn't be with me if he weren't, but my fear is maybe he is only attracted to me mentally and maybe he's just comfortable in our relationship. He may even think that he is physically attracted to me and thinks it's just on him that he can never become aroused by me. And maybe that's true! But I really can't shake the feeling that *I'm* the problem and I can't just ask him for the billionth time if he really is attracted to me because he'll just say yes like always even if he doesn't mean it.\n\nI just feel like I'm in murky water and I don't know how to move forward or get an honest introspective answer about how he feels about our relationship right now.

Some explicit detail about preferred sexual acts, was not going to mention at first but decided to because it\u2019s part of my gender and sexual confusion.\n\nI don't have a clue whether this is the right place to ask. I want advice and perspective but more than that I need an anonymous place to get this off my chest and people who can just talk to me about it. \n\nI'm AMAB yet for a very long time I've detested being masculine and constantly wanted to be feminine. All of the signs were there, from an extremely young age I really wanted to wear the same things as female friends and look like the women in books or on TV. I preferred feminine hobbies, preferred being friends with girls and thought boys were stupid (still do). My folks didn't care for that. Where I live, presenting feminine would destroy my life, but at least I managed to find a hobby that excused (and celebrated) men having feminine looks (but only rarely crossdressing or presenting as female). While growing up, once in a while when I found opportunities, I would buy female clothes and bras, hide them, and wear them in secret, and it felt right. It still feels right now when I do it. It seems quite clear cut that I have some gender dysphoria. \n\nI am really confused now though. For quite some years from high school to after I started working, I thought I came to terms with the idea that it\u2019s impossible for me to transition in the society I live in, doubly so since I certainly don't care for men and being both MtF and lesbian would make me a huge target. I accepted I would just have to live my whole life masculine. Almost a decade ago I met an amazing straight cis girl (we\u2019re still together) and she means the world to me \u2013 after all we\u2019ve been through, she\u2019s my top priority far ahead of everything else. We\u2019ve been slowly exploring our repressed sexualities and identities and I told her how I felt about my gender a few years back and she\u2019s supportive of me experimenting with presenting as female (in private, it\u2019s absolutely impossible for me to pass in public and anyway I\u2019m known as male everywhere I would go. I would try presenting as female in another country but I'm scared.)\n\nIt sounds quite straightforward but here\u2019s the catch. Despite the fact that my partner has some bi tendencies and is very LGBTQ-accommodating and is a fan of \u201cpretty boys\u201d, what she personally prefers most is being with somebody presenting as stereotypically male. I don't believe it's something that would break our relationship if I were to permanently become female/feminine, however me presenting as male both in daily life and in the bedroom is what makes her happy. Even worse for my confusion, I constantly used to detest having a penis and wished it was gone, however, the years in bed with her has led me to actually enjoy having a penis (sexually) and while I would want to present as female everywhere (for myself), with her I want to have the option to present as male in the bedroom and maybe elsewhere. This is extremely confusing for me. It's like I hated being masculine, but I feel content being male in the specific context of being with my partner. I want to be feminine for myself but masculine for her. But the weirdest part is that I want to be able to have sex with her both as a fully-male-bodied individual as well as a fully-female-bodied individual (not simultaneously). And more recently, I discovered I\u2019m very turned on by being on my knees giving a blowjob to a penis, as long as it\u2019s not attached to a masculine body, and I imagine I would very much want to take stereotypically female roles/positions in sex while presenting as female while my female partner takes stereotypically male roles/positions and I would be quite turned on if she had a penis (or strap-on) for me. But I\u2019m also very turned on by my partner doing the same to me. I don't understand myself.\n\nIt feels like a huge daunting messy spectrum of sexuality that I don't know how to break down. I really don\u2019t know how to navigate how I feel about this. It\u2019s really confusing.\n\nI was also worried over whether I actually want to present as female or whether I simply have a crossdressing sexual fetish. But I've been experimenting and I am quite sure I would like to present as female whether or not sex is involved. Presenting as female doesn't necessarily make me aroused unless I\u2019m putting on something I find particularly sexy, although honestly when I am aroused and presenting as female (or imagining myself presenting as female) I feel a lot more pleasure than when not presenting as female in any way, if that makes any sense. \n\nAlso, I'm not young anymore. Even if I start transitioning now, I don't think I'll ever feel as feminine as I want to, and in a couple of years I'll show signs of age and probably get worse body dysphoria. What's more, in the event that I do it, I will likely need to give up the career I've been building for my entire life and start from scratch once more, and that is extremely terrifying. \n\nr/TransSpace, I don't have any clue what to do or how to clarify my thoughts. I don't have anyone I can talk to about this aside from my partner, and I would prefer not to bring this up until I'm sure about my thoughts because I don\u2019t want her to feel like I\u2019m blaming her preferences for causing this confusion when it\u2019s not her, it\u2019s me and how I\u2019m confusingly attracted to her. What can I do?",

  "self_text": "I just really need to let this out.\n\nI'm 23 and have been struggling with depression and anxiety for 10+ years. I spent all of yesterday in bed and this morning I called the suicide hotline then wrote a suicide note. I've tied the rope around my neck before but haven't been able to do it yet. I suppose I have lot of good things going for me, I just feel worthless and hopeless and unmotivated. It feels like things are just falling apart, I want to talk to my friends so badly, I want to talk to other people, but I just feel so sad and ashamed. They went to help, I can feel it and I think that's part of why it's so hard. They want to offer solutions and talk to me about self care but they don't understand the numbness and self-hatred I feel. \n\nI'm currently going to therapy biweekly and am on medication. I think about suicide all the time, but I only sometimes really think about it. Today was one of those days. I wrote a note and then a separate note to my roommates to tell them my dead body would be downstairs and to just call the police rather than find it.  But I didn't do it. Instead, I made a doctor's appointment for this week so I could increase my medication dosage and I started looking around for one bedroom apartments. My roommate gives me really bad vibes a lot of the time, I have no evidence, he's never nasty I just feel like I can tell he avoids me. He knows I'm depressed and I think it makes him uncomfortable. I feel like even more of a burden when I'm depressed and he's around. I think living on my own could relieve some pressure. I also called my dad and told him what was going on. He's not really any help but he's supportive. \n\nI don't really know what the purpose of this post is. Just to get things off my chest I guess and to day I didn't do it.",

  "title": "The girl my bf used to hookup with is starting to freak me out a bit...",
  "author": "throwawayhello123123",
  "self_text": "Throwaway.\n\nMy (F24) boyfriend (M26) and I have been dating for about eight months or so. Before I even knew he existed, maybe six months or so before we started dating, he hooked up with this girl a small handful of times. I trust him more than life, and him, my best friends (who were there when they were sort of seeing each other when I lived in a different town for a while), even HER friends have told me, \"They were nothing. She was weirdly obsessed and couldn't get over the fact that he didn't want to date her.\" etc. etc. etc. Now within the last two months or so I've met her (we live in a small town where everyone knows everyone pretty much and everyone goes to the same two bars. It's inevitable that we'll run into each other. We even have a lot of casual mutual friends) and EVERY time we see each other she finds a way to somewhat casually throw in like, \"Hey no worries about you and \\_\\_\\_\\_ by the way, you guys are so cute, like it's not weird at all, don't even worry. I want us to be like BFFS though I think we could be such good friends!\" She's a super outgoing girl so the \"bff\" part makes sense kind of, like she's just exaggerating I think? And I would MAYBE understand her saying all of this one time? Even though we didn't even know each other when they hooked up so who cares? But it's every single time we see each other...\n\nLast Friday night we were at a bar and ran into her. She gave me a big hug and I complimented her beanie and said I have one just like it. She said, \"Oh! Well it's clear that \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ has a type!\" (my boyfriend). I felt so uncomfortable with this. Obviously. Like that's just inappropriate to say about my boyfriend or to suggest that he's really into both of us. (Also, just for the record, we couldn't look more opposite... not really relevant but like...)\n\nI told my boyfriend and he was pissed. He said he wanted to text her about it because he was over it and felt really bad. I told him not too because that would stir the pot even more and like I said, it's a small town with a lot of mutual friends and it would get really awkward really fast. I think next time she says something I'm going to casually say like, \"Hey dude no worries but let's just not discuss him anymore.\" The reason I have such an issue telling her off is because there's a chance she really is just trying to be nice and maybe is a little insecure and maybe she really truly does just want to be friends because we have a ton of mutual friends and interests, etc. In that case, I don't want to be rude. But come on... also, my biggest insecurity in relationships is comparing myself to my S/O's past girlfriends or hookups (I had an ex who cheated on me with his ex girlfriend and it sort of stuck). So this whole situation has layers of weird for me.\n\nSo my question... I know that obviously none of you know this girl so you can't really say. But I just have a hard time figuring out what this is... I feel like she's either intimidated by me but doesn't care about him and wants to just be good with me, maybe she's being totally manipulative and has it out for me a bit and is just being a bitch, maybe she's still a little obsessed with him, etc.? I have no idea, but it's making me so uncomfortable. If I KNEW she was just being a bitch, I'd say, \"Hey please fuck off\" and I'd have no problem with it. But if she is just trying to be friends in the weirdest way possible, then I don't want to be a bitch. What does it seem like she's trying to do? She's a super charismatic, social person so she talks to everyone super peppy and happy, it's not like she's just doing this sort of thing to me... but I don't know. I don't want to make a big deal out of nothing but I'm trusting my gut when I feel like she still kind of wants him...? I don't know. Any input or advice would be great.\n\nThank you!",

  "self_text": "Ok reddit, so I\u2019m in a pickle. I purchased a wedding dress like 2 years ago. During our engagement I became pregnant &amp; we had to postpone the wedding. I have 4 weeks left to fit in this dress. I gained about 65 pounds during pregnancy and delivered a beautiful baby 10 months ago. I struggled a lot with the weight loss, but have lost most of it. I\u2019m down to the last 10 pounds which feels really really good but also I\u2019m starting to panic. I\u2019m about 2\u201d from my dress fitting in the waist (will fit everywhere else now). So I need your help in ideas to get that area down. I\u2019ve been told to try wraps &amp; cleanses. Does anyone have any real experience with this stuff working? &amp; if so, which products did you use? \nI also want to say, I\u2019m not usually a fan of trying to take weight off super fast or on a specific timeline but this is a special circumstance where I kind of HAVE to make do with what I have. The dress is very intricate &amp; frankly it would be a fortune to make it bigger.\nSince mid June I\u2019ve been very low net carb &amp; extremely strict on my diet of mostly veggies and a little protein. I\u2019m close to OMAD but not quite because I\u2019ll have a spoonful of cottage cheese at some point during the morning. I also have been careful about CICO. Ive had good luck with this different times in my life &amp; realize how careful you need to be with measuring. I\u2019m on what many would consider a VLCD at this point - less than 1000 cals/day 152 lbs &amp; 5\u20193\u201d. My Apple Watch says I burn like 2200-2400 cals/day depending on the day. I don\u2019t think it can be quite that much. But I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m not losing more than I am. The numbers just aren\u2019t panning out. Also I\u2019ll randomly lose a couple of pounds after staying the EXACT same weight  for a week or more. I don\u2019t drink a lot of water- I know I need to change that piece. \nEveryone here seems to have great results so I\u2019m hoping one of you will have some advice for me. Thank you in advance!!",

It's making me feel depressed and I can't find any way to sort stuff out.  \nIf I don't do something on her terms then she gets annoyed, even if she knows that my way takes longer but I understand it better and can get it done still.  \nI even used to smoke weed to get rid of my back pain (I get muscle cramps around my spine, with some of it deformed), and she really hated it, and basically forced me to stop so now I have to use CBD oil which barely touches it, (I don't advocate for the use of drugs at all).  \nI also have symptoms of memory loss (probably not helped by the medication I was using), and she gets frustrated if I forget anything, although I can't help it! All my other friends incl. my best friend help me cope with it and understand, even repeating things just to help me out.  \nFor years I used to be on anti-depressants, and quite strong ones at that, but managed to reel myself off them via the doctor, and it was great for a while!  \nI just try to hide everything, but I'm on the same college course as her and I really don't know what to do...\n\n TL;DR, Bossed around by my partner, medical conditions she doesn't help me with, feeling depressed.",

  "author": "NoNewFriends2019",
  "self_text": "I'm back with lots of updates! We closed on our house 3 weeks ago (after a two week delay and shit show). FDH and I love our new home. Now onto the shit show that's transpired over the past month and a half.\n\n\nSo WW completely fucked herself and completely fucked FDH's finances and credit in the process with her bullshit. A little while after FDH moved in with me, before our house was finalized, FDH received a court summons to appear on the matter of back-rent owed at MIL house. Now he was confused because he had never paid rent there, his mother and stepfather did since it was their lease. Well, FDH went to the courthouse to explain that the letter couldn't be for him and there's no way he owed 4k in back rent...well the judge produced a lease from 8 years ago with his signature. Come to find out that MIL had him sign a lease for them when he was in his early 20s because they had just filed bankruptcy and she told him that they signed a new lease (easy since they were renting from a family member) about two years ago after it was discharged. Of course, him still being in the FOG he believed her and felt good that he did his deed as a good son (eye roll). Either way, WW had been served eviction papers back in June and refused to leave or pay up the rent (probably because she knew it wouldn't fall back on her). The judge basically threw the book at FDH and told him he had to pay the 4k in back rent plus attorney and court fees...totally up to over 10k. The judge wasn't trying to hear that he wasn't the one responsible for any of that and said everything and everyone had to be vacated from the property within 7 days or he would be arrested for trespassing. He was so upset that day his medical issues flared up and he was violently sick. \n\n\nSo he confronted The Warden the next day and she 'don't know anything about it', 'the judge is lying', 'the landlord is lying' blah blah blah. The crazy part is that she hid all of this from her husband as well and he's the one that works fulltime. She's spent over 6k from his salary and his social security on what was supposed to be for rent in bills on stuff that no one knows about. FDH told her she needed to pay all those fees herself and that she needed to vacate the property and he wasn't helping her. She refused of course, so he said he would take her to court himself if she didn't. Anyways, me and a friend of his helped him remove the rest of his stuff from their house and took it to my place. \n\n\nWe closed on our house a few days later and were in the process of getting the utilities cut on and FDH and I agreed that those would be in his name until after we got married (in case he needed a utility bill for something for proof of address and instead of giving them the contract that was drawn up by the lawyer). The utility companies informed him that he couldn't get new service until he paid past due amounts and put down a hefty deposit. He was confused of course because he never opened utilities in his name....well MIL did. She owed almost 1K from the two months she hadn't been paying it. FDH hit the fucking fan. We got the utilites put in my name and went straight to MIL house where they got into a screaming match. In the midst of it all MIL flicks her cigarette into some very dry, dead plants that caught a big fire very close to the front of the house. Her dumbass, in front of the neighbors, screamed 'this house can burn to the ground for all I care it's not in my name anyway' which pissed FDH off more as he tried to find something to but the fire out. It did kind of char the trim under a window. FDH said he no longer wanted ANYTHING to do with MIL and that the next and only times she would see him is in court.\n\n\nA few days after that, FDH goes to family member to explain the entire situation and how MIL had lied to him and if he could please do something about the court and eviction stuff on his name. The family member was real nice and happens to dislike MIL so hell yeah he would see about getting everything straightened out with the courts. As we were leaving he asked about the charred trim and FDH told him about what happened with MIL including her bolding statement about the house burning to the ground and he goes 'oh really?'. And just last week The Warden left a screaming message on his phone (since she's blocked) about how she had to go to court to pay for everything and being investigated for arson.....HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA..........FDH just said, oh well, serves her right. \n\n\nSo now we're just enjoying our new house and enjoying life without Warden Wendy in it..hopefully for a while!",

  "author": "yaloha95",
  "self_text": "I (24F) have a good friend (33M) who I used to work with, and considered him and I extremely close. Life happened, so our line of communication dropped off, and we both just moved on to different phases of our lives. Recently i've gotten back in touch with him, and from looking at conversations we used to have, and even some of the content now it just...gives me pause. When I looked back at our conversation from years ago (I dont even really know why i was doing this, maybe nostalgia?) we seem to have gotten into this huge fight where he says he needs some time to get over this because he feels like I treat him as a second option. but i dont remeber what \"this\" was? I don't even remember the fight. I have never had a friend of either gender say that to me. And there's smaller things, like how when talked about our days off and plans, he asks me who im with instead of what im doing. He was so consistent with making sure he followed up with me, like if i asked him to grab lunch and he had plans, he would either hold off on doing what he was doing or rearrange his day, or reschedule. I know for a fact he had other girls he was interested in at the time, and i started dating someone about 2 years after we met, which is when our communication really just fell flat, he couldn't stand the dude (but i dont think that was because of me) When i reached out to him, we exchanged a couple messages, just saying how we'd like to keep in touch, and an hour after the conversation ended he sent me another message that said \"Even though i dont do a good job of keeping in touch, I still think of you as a good friend and i get excited every time i get a message from you.\" In my mind when i read it, i thought wow how sweet i feel the same way, but when i mentioned all this to my friend she was like uuum i would not say that to a friend, especially if the conversation ended an hour ago. I mentioned he should take care of himself because i love having my friend back. he said \"I'm not going anywhere, at some point im going to meet your daughter and tell her stories about you.\" and when i mentioned to him that he should come visit, he said it wouldnt take very much convincing, but i live in hawai'i for crying out loud, who would need convincing to come here?! When i read the conversations as a whole, it doesn't seem that odd to me, and it doesn't seem as though hes interested in me romantically, but other peoples perspectives have started to seep into my mind. He was a really important part of my life, and going back to certain memories make me think twice about the nature of our relationship from both sides. I feel like im starting down a road of unnecessary overthinking, we dont even live in the same state anymore, but i a curious to get other male perspectives on what you guys think. Are these normal exchanges between two old friends?",

I feel like there's no way out, NOT because I'm lazy but because I cannot get the help I need to even take the first step in getting out.\n\nI also live in a shitty trailer that doesn't have potable water and there are rats and snakes and overgrowth all around. It makes me feel like I'm dirty and overall worth shit. It's like a sick joke where I work my ass off and can never get ahead. I can't cook my own food because of the filthy water and rat shit in the oven no matter how many times I clean it, I live too far away from places to go frequently and I've tried killing myself by OD here so I'm just about ready to leave before I do it again.\n\nThen I applied for an apartment that I really felt like I could get. I pay my rent I'm a good tenant and I never caused trouble for anyone in the trailer park. But there are so many people applying and I look like a worthless piece of shit on paper: young, shit job, no money, trailer trash, etc. And the people at the apartments were so nice and welcoming that I really felt like I could make it, like I could get it. The manager even said \"Welcome home!\". But as I finished the paperwork today, after a lot of running around town (literally) to get signatures and other shit, I asked how many people were looking at this place and the lady said so many. Like dozens. And so I asked if that means I won't get in and she said that they'll try their best to get me in, in an empathetic tone. But later informed me that they don't decide, corporate does. So I guess she fucking lied about 'trying their best to get me in'. As I thanked her and walked out I feel stupid and used. Used to get a fucking application fee. They tried so hard to make me feel like I could make it so I would hand that money over. I feel dumber than ever. The only way corporate sees me is on a piece of paper that says all the most negative shit about me that doesn't reflect my ethics or my character.\n\nSo now, no school, no new job, no new place. I'm in the same shithole I've been in for three years. And where I'll be for a long time. Hearing people say from afar \"It gets better!\" when I see the lives they live, how nice their shit is and how everything is taken care of for them but not for me. My parents didn't want a non-christian son in the house so fuck me.\n\nI put in so much effort to make life better but I have no time or resources, and my constant struggle with depression amplifies it. I'm not even sure I have depression I might just have a shit life. But I know that I see other people all the time who say they're depressed. And sleep all day and stay inside, and I believe them and respect them because I know how much this hurts. But I can't help but feel even worse because through all the shit I deal with I always have to keep pushing harder and harder, get up earlier and deal with this shit life head on. I've been in this mess for 3 years and I'll never get out. All just to stay afloat, to stay alive in a world I'm coming closer to not wanting to be in anymore.\n\nI just want it to end. I just want peace. I just want to sleep and never worry again.",

  "author": "LongTurnover8",
  "self_text": "Hey all,\n\nI've never posted on reddit before so forgive me if I'm doing this all wrong. BUT...I am (very proudly) gay and have been in a relationship with an absolutely incredible guy for about 5.5 years. Sadly, although my own parents/extended family are supportive of us and our relationship 100%, his parents/family are very much not. Navigating the tension between us and them has easily been the most painful and challenging obstacle I've faced in life, given that I value family a TON and am super close with my own family.\n\nI am a teacher (third grade, general ed) but do lots of music stuff on the side, which sometimes includes a little bit of songwriting to cope with life's weird shit. I wrote this particular song in response to a realization I had a few years back about my partner's parents -- I could talk for days about what exactly inspired this song but, simply put, there's no possible way for us to \"compromise\" or meet them in the middle when it comes to building a relationship between us and them. I tried to imagine a scenario where my partner's family might sacrifice a few of their strongly-held beliefs and we sacrificed \\*\\*something\\*\\* of our own to meet them in the middle ground...but then realized that we can't possibly (and shouldn't have to) give up any part of who WE are to meet them where THEY are. In other words, we're going to keep on living the beautiful shared life we've built, and let them figure out if they're going to change/welcome us into their lives/embrace their son and his partner as they are, or not. It took me a long time to reach the point where I fully believe this but - I refuse to be a lesser version of who I am to appease someone else.\n\nSo - this song is called Fraction. If it makes even just one LGBTQIA+ person who is walking through a similarly hellish scenario with non-supportive folks feel less alone, I'll be so stoked, hence why I thought it would be fun to share it here on Reddit. Much, much love to you all.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeQa3L0yS9o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeQa3L0yS9o)\n\nP.S.!

We have had a pretty trusting relationship, and when we first started dating he made sure to tell me like hey my phone is open whenever you want it. I trust you. \n\nWell the other day he was texting an old friend (25F) and when I peeked at his phone he kinda like hid the phone screen from me. He seemed kinda annoyed that I would even want to look.  FYI, we were cuddling and I don\u2019t normally read his messages but like if you\u2019re right next to each other and you look over you\u2019re gonna see what the person is saying. He\u2019s never done that before. So safe to say it felt very weird to me. \n\nWell the other day he did it again. Idk who he was texting but I peeked and he grabbed the phone away so I got worried. I tested it later by asking if I could read what he sent a friend because he was laughing really hard and I wanted to be in on the joke. HE PUT AWAY the phone and was like oh I\u2019ll summarize and then didn\u2019t give any info. \n\nSo now I\u2019m getting worried, and I did (I\u2019ll admit) the craziest thing. The next time we were together, when he went to go grab something I went through his messages to see what he was texting that friend. It ended up being nothing, but he ended up catching me and man was he pissed. I instantly felt bad and guilty and knew I had done wrong. I was also insanely embarrassed, like when did I become that girl? So I asked if he wanted to talk about why I went to such lengths.\n\nThe part that is getting me now is that he was pissed for like 30 minutes then was fine. He told me he didn\u2019t understand why I would do that, but when I asked if he wanted to talk he was like no and changed the subject. Someone tell me I\u2019m being crazy please or advice on how to approach this. How do you not want to talk about your gf snooping through your phone when you have a trusting relationship, and so called open phone relationship????",

Its something that I have known about for roughly 4 years now and it feels like if I don't do it soon, I'll basically break down inside.\n\nBut I'm scared that everything I know and all the relationships I've built up with people will be broken down. My mum and I are really close and she has asked me before whether I am gay or not and I have denied it - I don't want her to feel like I don't trust her or I've let her down in some way. Me and my sister are also close but she has previously said homophobic comments and I'm not sure whether me coming out would change her perception on the LGBTQ+ community or ruin our relationship. \n\nI'm also worried about what people at work might say - I've been with the company for almost two years now and I'm liked by generally everyone. But I dont want that to change for me, or for people to start treating me differently. Although, I don't really enjoy my job anymore too much so this would only be the final straw for me to hand my notice in and leave if this is the case. \n\nHowever, there is this one boy that I work with that's about a month younger than me and I am absolutely crushing on - we have similar interests (we both like stand up comedy and comedians/ similar music/ both love horrors) and he makes me laugh a lot, plus things seem flirty between us sometimes, and I'll buy him food/drinks if he's got horrible shifts where he can't get food and he offered me a lift home the other day. He will also dodge questions about getting a girlfriend or being in a relationship, and the other week, when a co-worker mentioned about getting him a girlfriend or boyfriend, he didn't say anything and just stayed quiet. But I may be looking into things a lot as he could just be really kind and I could just be really hopeful. He has zero confidence and is always putting himself down and I want to tell him how I feel about him and that, even if he doesn't like me or is straight, then he will find someone right for him because he is amazing.\n\nBut I can't. Because I'm not out, and as much as I want to do it, I'm just scared that what little I do have will disappear.\n\nI don't think anyone will read this, but I just needed to get this off my chest.",

Last year i distanced myself from her so i could get some space. Over the summer we became super close again, and i fell for her again, then she got a boyfriend. He is not a fan of the fact that we hang out, He thinks that we're going to fuck, even tough we are specifically said we won't and I'm also waiting until marriage (by choice). They have had lots of problems, to the point of yelling at each other. near the last day of summer we watched a movie, and afterwards she texted me and said she felt something between us. I did too. i got extremely excited because i thought we would could finally figure stuff out between us. on the last day of summer we watched another movie an afterwards i brought this up, and we talked about it. We kissed. I was happy for a split second, then i realized that i made a mistake and i apologized so many times. If he ever found out he would kill her, because he hates me even though he\u2019s never talk to me. He only hates me because I hang out with her. the week after that its like all feelings she had for me were gone. as if they were never there. that messed me up. That was a few weeks ago, and i can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop thinking about her. I think she knows but she keeps asking me whats wrong and I'm afraid if I tell her it will make life so hard, because I can't lose her again.
