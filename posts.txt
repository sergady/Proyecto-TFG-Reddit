She was 19 years old ( I was 20 at the time, now 22) she was coming home from work, she was on the highway and came to a full stop due to traffic ahead of her, however the semi truck behind her never stopped and went into her, pinching her car between 2 semi trucks. The pain I felt when I found out she had died, the feeling of picking out the clothes that she will be viewed in for the last time. Seeing my best friend in a casket, man that feeling/moment is something I will never forget. She was my foundation. I\u2019m not close with my own family and she and her family are/were my family. Losing my best friend has impacted my life in so many ways. I\u2019m currently going through  intensive ptsd therapy because I\u2019m so scared to get behind the wheel or be a passenger in the car. I am crippled by the fear of dying in my car. This has impacted my professional, social and even my love life. I was doing really good for a while, but lately I feel so crippled by anxiety and depression that I\u2019m having a hard time coping day to day.

What ensued was hours of her almost comically trying to baby me and give me every food and drink she knows I enjoy (I didn't accept any of it except a cup of melting ice btw) while threatening to kick me out if I didn't respect her, moaning about how I cut her off \"for no reason\" (Actually because she tried to force me to birth a child I don't want and can't care for, as I've posted before) after we agreed to talk things through, how she wasn't going to go against her principles by helping me get an abortion (which I never asked her to do anyway), etc. She also denied having hung up on me when Dirty Hypocrite, my MIL, assaulted me while I was still pregnant.

He said it was up to me. Then she called Dirty who also told her I was okay. So then she phoned my grandpa, who doesn't have my new number, and my grandma. She told my grandma that she's \"super worried\" about my health despite having been told twice already that I'm fine, and she also told my grandma that my MIL told her she hasn't been able to reach me either.

I just speak to her when I absolutely have to and visit maybe once every three months. It's fabulous.\n\nVery recently, I attended a sports event that my sibling-in-law was in. While there, my MiL wanted my SO and myself to come over and see her friend's grandchild. My SO never talks to these people, but we went over because it would have been awkward not to (lame excuse but it would have been.. she was loud asking us to come over and it was a public space full of locals who know my in-laws). As soon as we get over, MiL's friend goes \"you guys, [MiL] needs one of these herself!!!\". My SO awkwardly replied \"uh, no not anytime soon\" and I could only say \"well, she's young enough to adopt another one herself\" pointedly. It got real quiet and I just started talking to the baby's mother. \n\nIt wasn't much but usually I'm very non-confrontational and to say something instead of laughing it off was actually a step forward for me. I should been able to just brush this interaction off... but combined with her past behavior and her words from before I can't! This interaction has been bugging me so badly.

Earlier this week DH told his JNM to stop talking to us (after a great number of incidents which I will definitely be sharing in other posts). \n\nMy BIL is a complete bum and is totally enabled by his parents. I will occasionally ask him to babysit our DD cause I know he needs money and my daughter loves him. Welp, he has notoriously sticky fingers which had caused us to go NC previously. On Monday he watched DD for half an hour while DH and I were viewing a house. Well doesn't he end up stealing from us for the millionth time (my husband indulges in marijuana since it's legal here, and had it hidden away) and we noticed. So I very politely told him verbatim \"while I suuuuuper appreciate you watching DD, that doesn't mean you can help yourself to DH's weed\". in my mind it's the same as helping yourself to someone else's booze while you're watching their kid.  Well doesn't he go home and tell JNMIL that we're never letting them see DD again (we said if they keep ignoring our wishes as parents/feeding her unsafe food/calling me names that DD is now repeating; we would limit contact) and a bunch of other BS. They call us screaming &amp; my husband was not having it. He let loose, told them exactly how they've hurt us and to jog on. \n\nWell don't we get a call from the Bank &amp; a text from JNMIL that JNMIL had tried to close his bank account but wasn't able to cause he wasn't there. My husband still has his account linked to hers cause she likes to use her credit card for air miles so she would put our large purchases on and we'd just transfer the money, but she's unable to move money without him authorizing it. My husband's savings is where we keep our nest egg so there's a lot in there &amp; I guess she knew this. I don't know if she was hoping the money would go into limbo and we'd be completely screwed for a few days or if she was planning on taking it and using it as leverage to see DD and our bun in the oven. Needless to say it didn't work because thank god our bank has competent employees, but also WTAF. Who does that? Like if she had such an issue having them linked she could have just said something and we would have dealt with it. But no, trying to mess up our finances is obviously the most logical choice to her. Another thing to note, is she did this knowing how important it is not to stress me out. I'm high risk for this pregnancy and stress almost caused DD to be born early and I've already been having some worrying signs with the bun in the oven, so purposefully doing something like this is in my eyes completely putting my unborn babies health below her desire to be petty.

Everything seemed to go well, we had chemistry, a 1st kiss and an agreement for a second date. We made things clear before we met in that he claimed he was looking for something long term, where as I wasn't sure what I was looking for but that something pretty serious was not what I wanted, however wouldn't knock something if it turned out that way. (Probably my first mistake).\n\n2nd date also went well and again an agreement for the 3rd. However no specifics were planned. He'd hinted in a drunken chat that i was his '1st choice' to which I figured he was also dating other people which he was well within his rights to do. I then had a pretty heavy night with my friends and thought to myself I may as well get in there whilst I have a chance, have nothing to lose and have lost him anyway (it'd been a long long time since I'd had sex) and invited him over for a drunken booty call to which he answered.\n\nIt ended up being rather incredible, so much so that it made me question everything the next day, but in a positive way. No regrets and I'm reclaiming my sexuality. \n\nAfter this he wanted to see me for another date a few days after where he'd brought me a box of chocolates and a copy of a book we'd both been talking about. We ended up having non-drunk sex which was also incredible. Few days later he asked me if I wanted to be 'exclusive'. I agreed but was a little apprehensive as everything has been moving quite fast. Another date also followed which was in public and rather sweet.\n\nNext date, we did a Netflix and chill type thing, he also brought me another gift which was meaningful me. And we had sex again. And he's the one who's referenced being in a relationship.\n\nNow it's a week later, we have barely texted, I've been reaching out because he'd asked me to and get nothing in return. There's been no plans for a follow-up meeting. He usually only texts me when he's drunk. It's been about a month and I have yet to be invited to his place. I have no idea where his head is at.\n\nHis last texts were about him helping out a drunk girl on a night out, to which he said 'i did the right thing but still feel like a scumbag'. Either something more happened on this night out or he's just being weird. \n\nIt all seems very suspicious, however why on Earth did he ask me to be exclusive in the first place, if he hadn't of done it, it'd be fine to keep it casual. I'm new to dating again so I don't know if I've forgotten the rules or that there's just people out there more confused than I am about what they want.\n\nTL;DR! sex has clouded my judgement, dating advice, have I been messed about?", "subreddit": "relationships"}

She has called from a blocked number numerous times and left voicemails that you can\u2019t understand because she is talking like she had a stroke (news flash: she didn\u2019t really have one). I\u2019ve ignored them since I can\u2019t block a call from \u201cno caller ID.\u201d She\u2019s made vague Facebook posts that I screenshot as documentation just in case, put in a folder on my phone, and forget about. \n\nThe past week she has called my little sister over and over again. For context, my sister left the house about 3 years ago and came to live with me (we are 12 years apart). She recently went 3.5 hour away to college. Since she left our nmom has been trying to get her to talk, because nmom still has it in her head that I wouldn\u2019t allow my sister to talk to her and that I was \u201ckeeping her\u201d from nmom.  \n\nToday I received a very lengthy Facebook message from her.  https://imgur.com/a/hRPDGRD  It\u2019s FULL of gaslighting. She (supposedly) has MSA-C syndrome. I don\u2019t know what that is and quite frankly, I don\u2019t care. \n\nThe issue herein is that she\u2019s lying. All the things she claims I said or did in this message are not true. I recognize the gaslighting but here\u2019s where I need advice, because this is my absolute only weak spot:\n\nMy grandmother and I were very, very close. She is really who raised me and tried to protect me from my nmom any way she could. She\u2019s the reason I didn\u2019t end up just like my nmom. She hated who my nmom was and could not stand her, just as I can\u2019t, but she stayed for her granddaughters. She took abuse for us, both physical and emotional, just so it wasn\u2019t directed at us...any chance she got. If there\u2019s a Saint, it\u2019s her. She would give anyone the shirt off her back even if it was the last shirt she owned. My grandma passed away 3 years ago and that\u2019s when shit hit the fan.\n\nMy nmom making all these claims about things I did to or said about her and my grandma (where she says \u201cmom\u201d that\u2019s who she\u2019s referring to, my grandma) that are not true. I would never have done anything to my grandma and everyone that knew her in my circles knew how close we were. When my nmom makes any insinuations and accusations involving my grandma it triggers my anxiety and fury more than literally anything on the planet. I would have done anything to keep my grandma on this earth. \n\nShe also claims that someone who\u2019s a client at my business is her therapist. Sadly for her, she doesn\u2019t know any clients in my business anymore as anyone she would have known is now graduated out of our program. When she tries to bring my job and career into her nonsense it really pisses me off.\n\nShe also claims she would want me to take stuff to my niece who lives with my other sister about an hour away. Little does she know, that sister and I don\u2019t speak. She\u2019s the nsis and I don\u2019t have room for that in my life.\nThen there\u2019s her friends that I allegedly talk to...except I don\u2019t. The last talk I had with her \u201cbest friend\u201d was June of 2018 over Facebook and it was literally her asking if I\u2019d spoken to my nmom lately, me saying \u201cno I have not,\u201d and that was the end of it. That part just makes me laugh, though. \n\nLastly I know she is trying to use the whole \u201cinsurance money\u201d bit to try to get me to respond so that she can claim I\u2019m \u201conly doing it for the money.\u201d I don\u2019t want or need her money. \n\nI guess my question is, should I respond somehow? What would I even say? I know defending yourself against a narcissist does no good. But I am tired of her making these false claims because I know she tells other people these lies as well. I don\u2019t want to be her executor but I do want whatever belongings and momentos she still has from my childhood. How should I proceed?", "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists"}
{"post_id": "cy380k", "title": "Me (18M) and my girlfriend (18F)", "author": "throwaway990098", "self_text": "An event recently occurred where I got invited to a small drinks by a friend I met at University. I myself and everyone their is studying in STEM field. At this event I met a girl who was flirting at me but very subtly, because I try maintain being a good person I didn't flirt back, but the thoughts lingered of actually leaving my girlfriend to be single and pursue a relationship with her. Am I on a level of immature where I shouldn't even be in a relationship and sort my shit out? Note I honor truth in a relationship and told her about this incident and brought up parts of the *below backstory* with her, and now just stuck on what I should do.\n\nSome back story:  \nI've been with my current girlfriend for nearly a year now. And before it (when I was in high school) I had a relationship of nearly 3 years with my ex. These relationships are pretty much back to back (I was single for probably around a week in between these two relationships). Being with someone for 3 years naturally makes you best friends and when it all went away it made me rush getting into another relationship.\n\nAlthough it was rushed how I met my current girlfriend without giving myself time to rethink and contemplate on my life but, I get along with my current girlfriend. I got with her based on personality and not how visually attractive I thought she was. (Note, I feel like in hindsight it would've been better if I stayed single and worked on myself and find out what I needed in a person). But we have some mutual humor which was unknown territory to me, where I can make her genuinely laugh and smile.\n\nHowever, my girlfriend didn't complete the last year of high school (worked part-time/full-time instead) as her plans prior to being with me was to go to Europe (a different continent to where I am), and chase a career of doing Super Yachting (this didn't sound like a full proof plan as the demand for these roles are not high).\n\nAfter she met me though, I influenced her to complete her last year of high school and now she's also planning to study a STEM subject at University. She is very happy she met me and in her words \"positively influence her\". The thing is I wish I had this kind of push as well. I myself am studying a STEM subject at university and she cant push me like I push her. Her words have no authority since she isn't as academic.\n\nNote: I do not have the notorious mentality where I think STEM is superior, so apologies if the above seemed like that. In fact I am not doing well myself and wish I could have the same support my girlfriend has.\n\nSo the thing is. I don't know whether that incident (second time its happened) was caused because:  \nA: My current girlfriend isn't the one. We just aren't compatible.  \nB: I am immature and not ready for a committed relationship. I need to be single and find out what I specifically need in a person.  \nC: It's normal, these thoughts happen even when you have found the \"one\"\n\nSo could you please tell me which one of the above I am or just help me out because I have a lingering suspicion she isn't the one.", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

Things went wrong", "author": "friendthreeway", "self_text": "TL;DR I had a threesome with my best friend and male friend. Both had ulterior motives. Best friend had a crush on me but I didn't return her feelings. Now she's not speaking to me.\n\nI had a threesome with two of my friends a month ago. We'll call them Leah and Jake. Leah is my best friend and I met Jake through her two years ago. I thought he was attractive but I could tell he had a thing for Leah and I had a boyfriend at the time.\n\nI broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year. It was a bit of a bummer but I started to enjoy my singlehood. I had a couple of hookups but nothing serious. I was talking to Leah about my escapades and I mentioned I would like to try a threesome. It was something me and my ex both wanted to do but we never found a third. I joked that me and her should find a guy to share. To my surprise, she was actually down for it.\n\nThe first guy that came to my mind was Jake. We knew and trusted him so it seemed perfect. I talked to him about it and he agreed. We set a date to do it at my house. The day came and they came over. We watched a movie and Jake and I had a couple of drinks (Leah does not drink alcohol). We went into the room and Leah and I made out as did me and Jake. Leah refused to kiss Jake which modeled her behavior throughout the night. Whenever he went to touch her, she pulled away. When she was going down on me, he penetrated her from behind and she screamed. We stopped and she started yelling at him. An argument broke out between all us and she left. He waited around for a moment then left too.\n\nI talked to her a few days later and she admitted she only agreed to a threesome as a way to get with me. She said she was in love with me and had been for awhile. She had no intentions of having sex with Jake or any other man. She felt he ruined her and had been crying about it ever since. I actually felt bad and comforted her. She decided to cut ties with Jake. \n\nI spoke to him and his story was pretty much like hers. He saw the threesome as opportunity for him to be with her. He was OK with having sex with me but his main goal was her. I told him what she said and he got mad and doesn't understand how he \"ruined\" her and thinks she needs to get over it.\n\nIt's been a month now and everything's pretty much back to normal between me and Jake. However, things are still rocky with Leah. We have only spoken a few times since the incident and the last time I had to make it bluntly clear that there was no chance of us ever being together. Haven't heard from her since. I think she ended the friendship and I'm really hurt. What do I do? Is there anyway to fix this? I have been on the end of unrequited love before. I'm still friends with the guy but it did take a while for it to stop feeling weird.", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

I don't have a good relationship with food, and J has known this from the beginning. I used to come over to him and his parents house and would have full blown panic attacks over not being able to finish what small amount of food I would let myself take. Growing up it was always an effed up combination of, \"you always waste so much food!\" Even if I only had three bites left, and \"only take a little bit!\" To make sure there was enough for my two brothers and my parents. When I first started being friends with J he wouldn't push it too much. He'd just encourage me to snack on a bag of chips if a full plate of food felt too overwhelming. \n\nAfter almost an entire year of his Mom cooking, feeding, not criticizing my choices or guilting me about all this the anxiety started to get better. I stopped feeling guilty over a few leftover bites, or getting a second helping of something. But the second I get back home it starts all over. I can't cook for myself at home because if the kitchen isn't cleaned to perfection after I get yelled at, but I can't eat food out either because then I'm just wasting money when we have \"perfectly good food you could cook here!\" Then, factor in half the time the food I decide to cook was, \"going to be used for dinner and I should have known better\" and the fact that most mornings I get up at 4:20 for work, and God forbid I make noise! I only realized a month ago that the reason I have a problem even remembering to drink water half the time is because my Dad will yell at us for daring to leave our water glasses everywhere, so if we don't finish it right away we have to dump it down the sink. \n\nRight now, I am sitting on my bed too afraid to go downstairs to bring up a snack. Half the time I just go to bed hungry if dinner didn't fill me up, sometimes I just don't bother eating at all. I hate being so anxious about this, and I don't know how to make it stop. I spent $9 on some fried mushrooms and a coke earlier (we were on our own for dinner at a festival while my Grandma is in town) and now I'm trying not to cry because I just wasted so much money on something that didn't fill me up for long, and I feel guilty that I spent money period because I should have just eaten at home even though...well. see the argument above. It's a cycle that I feel trapped in, and even if I have the money for something I still ask J for permission to spend it because if he says it's ok the anxiety dissipates. He's super patient about it, and he keeps reassuring me I'll get there and it will get easier but I'm having a really hard time tonight...\n\nWhenever I do go out to eat or make myself food, or get something while I work, I almost always go for the high calorie foods because I want to make sure it will fill me up. I'm always afraid I'm going to get shaky hungry later in the day (especially if I'm working), and I know it's not always the healthiest thing. I'm maintaining my weight thankfully, but that's partially thanks to fizzy drinks. If I go for more than a week without pop I start to lose a few pounds and I hate it. I'm a healthy weight for the first time in my life (since J's mom started feeding me three years ago) and I want it to stay that way, but I know I don't have a good relationship with food at all.

I say all that to say that there were some immediate trust issues going on on both ends. I was still doing \"comfortable relationship\" things with my first child's father and my current boyfriend had a history before me of cheating and always being with multiple girls. I made a mistake with my first child's father when I first got with my current boyfriend that I won't mention and my current boyfriend made a few mistakes with other girls early on in our newly developing relationship. Obvious red flags but of course we were too infatuated with each other to realize it. So that was a little background. With that in mind, fast forward to about almost 2 years into our relationship, he CHEATS. I stupidly take him back in hopes that it was a one time mistake...but then IT KEEPS HAPPENING...with the same girl. (who, by the way, is COMPLETELY disrespectful and gives no fucks that she's sleeping with a man who she KNOWS still sleeps with me; so clearly a bonafide side chick) He continuously tried to talk to this girl and see her behind my back, WHILE WE LIVED TOGETHER. All the while promising me he wasn't but lying about everything. Not to mention he likes to go out and drink A LOT, so him getting drunk and being out multiple nights in a row wasn't helping the situation. So we ended up actually losing our apartment because of his drinking and partying ways, and then moved in with his grandparents (don't ask why I was still with him because I HAVE NO IDEA) But the \"affair\" girl's number KEPT popping up ONCE AGAIN after promising me change. So after more attempts of me moving out and leaving him and saying it was the last time, his mom finds us an apartment pretty far away from my current boyfriend's \"party scene\" including all his rowdy, alcoholic friends etc. He tells me this is the change that we need for him to prove that he can be better. So we moved and we've been at this new apartment for about a month now. And he has been with me pretty much EVERY DAY. He promised to cut back on going out and drinking, which he definitely has, and there also hasn't been any mishaps regarding the \"affair\" girl. I think it's safe to assume she's FINALLY out of the picture, besides the fact that I just don't trust him now so I think he's finding ways to talk to and see her, even though like I mentioned, he's been with me EVERY DAY and he leaves his phone out face up around us with the ringer on to try to prove she is in fact, gone. (because remember, she's a YOUNG, very disrespectful girl who would try to blow their cover any chance she had just to hurt me) The problem is that I feel like I have ptsd from staying with him through him continuously cheating on me. I'm pretty good with trusting my intuition when I feel like somethings off but lately I think its just been a matter of \"paranoia\" because as I mentioned, he's been with me everyday so there's physically no way for him to have cheated. I still accuse him every day of cheating and it could be because of the smallest or dumbest thing and every day or every other day I attempt to break up with him because of how fucked up I am in my mind from dealing with his lying and cheating. But he BEGS me to stay (which he didn't before, he would just let me leave) and reassures me that he is a changed man and he will never hurt me like that again and I FEEL like its genuine this time. So now he's actually being a better man for me and I see it but I can't fully enjoy it because the past is still haunting me. So I guess my question is should I give him yet ANOTHER chance to try to prove to me that he actually made a misake, or should I just find a way to let this go?", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

Also might be depressed again.", "author": "rbrt_", "self_text": "I thought my depression was gone. I\u2019ve been numb for months now, due to medication. I can\u2019t seem to care for a lot of things anymore and no matter how much I want to cry, I physically can\u2019t. It\u2019s really annoying and it can be frustrating. My self esteem right now is worse than ever in my life. I don\u2019t even want to leave the house if I don\u2019t need to, I don\u2019t want to be seen by anymore, ESPECIALLY friends and acquaintances. I don\u2019t want them to see how disgusting I look. Can\u2019t remember the last time I went out to have fun, I now spend all my free time at home. I run home when I\u2019m done with work. \n\nDoing my makeup is my favourite thing in the world and I haven\u2019t done it in months. I find it pointless even though I never did it to look pretty in first please cause I couldn\u2019t if I tried. I avoid looking in the mirror as much as I can. Sometimes if I spend a long time without seeing my reflection I start to think I may not look as bad. It turns out I unfortunately find myself to look much worse when I finally do it. Needless to say I\u2019m uninterested in sex. Even if someone presumably wanted to get intimate with me, I believe no one should experience the repulsiveness that is my body. \n\nToday I had to shop for glasses which has ALWAYS been a struggle by itself since my face is abnormally wide. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how I should get new clothes for my family holiday (in less than 2 weeks) because if my mum sees me in my same old clothes again she\u2019s gonna yell at me. I literally have nothing but rags and very casual clothes since I\u2019ve gained some weight and nothing else fits. So I looked into Zara and gave up right away cause I know nothing will look good because I look like shit. And if you think I should do something \u201cnice for myself\u201d to help with my self image, I went to get my hair done for the first time since December. It looked good for 2 days and now it looks terrible when I wash it from all the bleach. Guess I deserved it cause I\u2019m also stupid. I\u2019ve just realised I actually wish I could not go on this trip tbh. I would just cancel everything if I could. I\u2019d rather stay home than be uncomfortable abroad. Just thinking about it makes my stomach turn.\n\nI also felt I was about to have a panic attack today (saw a cute old lady and felt emotional for some reason then it trigged everything else) which I haven\u2019t had in a long time. Had to run to the nearest toilet to cry (yay? At least there are some tears left) and thought I was going to faint or vomit at any time. \n\nSo what is all this? I know I have a self esteem problem (I have thought I was tragically ugly but lived my life and tried to have fun regardless) but this sudden anxiety attack seems so strange. Is it possible that my depression is coming back? Are my meds not working anymore?   Should I tell my family I don\u2019t want to go on the holiday or just suck it up and show up wearing a burlap sack?\n\nTLDR I have a feeling I might be depressed again and my self esteem has never been worse. I also have a family trip in less than two weeks and just the thought of it is making me squeamish.", "subreddit": "Anxiety"}

We have been together for almost four years now, and like all relationships, we have our petty arguments, but we generally get along very well and have fun together and have comparable life-goals in terms of careers and general desires. However, there is one glaring issue with our relationship in the fact that she is a devout Catholic and that I am not. For context, I am not an atheist, but would consider myself 'spiritual but not religious'. I don't object to the idea of some form of deity or creating force, but I have never been a religious person and find the idea of structured spiritual beliefs, with all its rituals, figureheads, and traditions, alien to me. Of course, this is not the case for her, and she has been going to Church every Sunday for her entire life. While she does question some of the traditions and dogma of the Church, she is still fairly pious and I know that she wants me to join her in this. The problem is that I simply cannot do this.  I have tried to become more open to the ideas espoused by her faith, but a lifetime without these beliefs has seemingly made it impossible for me to believe in such things. I know that as our relationship has grown, this problem has and will continue to grow as well, especially as we begin to discuss our possible future together (e.g., the possibility of my conversion for the sake of marriage, how to raise any children we may have, etc.). I know that her parents have also expressed doubts in me regarding this, even though they like me as a person. I have talked to some of my friends who are religious (and of different faiths) and they have all said it is wrong to convert to a religion if you do not truly believe in its doctrine, something that I agree with as I find that it is disingenuous if you are just trying to 'trick' your partner. With that being said, I feel like it would be very difficult to be with my girlfriend long-term without my doing this. She has also been talking about how she wants more \"commitment\" on my part. She claims it is not a hint at wanting to be engaged, but I feel it probably is in a way (or at least in getting a promise ring) and that she just feels nervous to say so. I feel like I am at a cross-roads in our relationship; either I somehow take the plunge into Catholicism and join her, something which I do not think I am capable of doing, or we break things off. After reading many responses on this subreddit, it seems like the latter option is the most likely outcome. I honestly don't want this, and would like for our relationship to succeed, but I also do not want to be unrealistic. I truly do not want my girlfriend to be hurt (or me, for that matter) as I adore her and think she is a great person, deserving of the best person possible for her. But I also fear that, if this must be done, putting it off any longer will only cause more harm down the line.\n\nI guess I am just looking to vent and for some advice.

So this time I\u2019ve been on only 2.5 months, about 4-6 TBSPS/day. So withdrawal is never too bad with just Kratom, even after a 2 year daily stint, that was a little worse but nothing like Bupenorphine it what I\u2019d expect other opioids...\nSo what I really need help with is not getting off, nor even getting past the withdrawals or even depression that\u2019s from the withdrawals.\n\nNow after I\u2019m well and done, off and ready for life, the depression is the only thing that lingers and then stays for a time idk because I end up using something. This isn\u2019t an SSSRI Zoloft thing. It is something with the Kratom and the anti-depression it causes, so when I stop that coping part goes away. With other substances the anti-depression they bring (whether it be euphoria, contentness, happy, worry-free) and then therefore the subsequent depression that follows, goes away in after a period.\nIt seems kratom is different.

I\u2019m not here to fish for attention or compliments, I\u2019m not here to seem like I\u2019m begging for people to shower me with positive comments, I\u2019m just here to get this off my chest because I\u2019m trapped, I feel like I need to say this to someone but I have no one I can talk to. I don\u2019t know if saying this will help and to be honest I don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t think much can help anyway. I just need to know that atleast one person heard my story before I go. Since I was a kid I\u2019ve always been on the chubby side, always putting the reasoning down to \u2018just being a kid\u2019 and that it\u2019ll \u2018get better soon\u2019 when I\u2019m more mature and able to push myself to stop eating. But that mentality never came. In fact it\u2019s gotten worse. I eat food when I\u2019m bored, sad, angry, depressed, anything. I just can\u2019t stop myself from being able to say \u201cNo\u201d to it. And as a result I\u2019m so overweight but, even more so, I\u2019m so disgusted by myself everyday. I have nothing against people who are overweight and contempt with it but I hate the look of myself every time I catch a glimpse in the mirror. That\u2019s ultimately the beginning of the spiral down. \n\nA year and 3 months ago was the catalyst to this all. Not only was I the largest I\u2019ve ever been but I was the loneliest after the whole \u2018events\u2019 happened (more on that later.) Prior to the \u2018events\u2019 I was part of a big group of friends, consisting of 2 guys that were the closest to me as I was to them, I\u2019ll call them Jack and Ben. Jack, a good friend but not as close to me as Ben was, usually would invite us round or go out to play football and do what most 15 year olds did at this age. And Ben would come out aswell, but we were not surprised when he would tell us that he was instead going to make plans with his girlfriend. Both great personalities but I was never invited to parties that they would go to, days out with mates that they would enjoy or even sleepovers that they would be having. I was always outcasted in the best of times. Which ultimately just forced my self esteem to plummet quickly. \n \nBefore I write the next bit I need to say I\u2019m  not proud of this, and I never will be by any means. I apologised more than I thought I could to my friends but to no avail, and rightly so. I was outcasted, and I was and loner with friends who would act like friends when there was no other entertainment from other peers at school. So I got lonely, very lonely, and to be honest I became desperate; desperate for even the slightest bit of attention, desperate for someone to just talk to me and put a smile on my face, desperate for someone just to come up to me and ask if I was okay. So as an attempt to attract attention I, stupidly, faked having a girlfriend. Stupid I know, but it worked, people were asking me about her, talking to me, happy for me and most of all, people wanted to hear me talk to them, even for a second. It was good, and bad. The good parts consisted of awesome conversations, the greatest pieces of interest in my life and smiles being thrown across the place. But the bad parts consisted of the worry of being caught, the hopelessness of the reality of it all and, Ofcourse, the immense guilt of lying to those very friends who I thought cared about me. \n\nBut, as many lies nowadays, I was caught. Filled with relief that I didn\u2019t have to lie anymore but overcome with guilt too. This is school we are talking about. That kind of lie being found out would\u2019ve been the equivalent of having Lamborghinis being handed out for free to all of the students. They thought it was Christmas come early. And Ofcourse, it spread like wildfire. Now, you\u2019ll think it\u2019s childish to find out that I\u2019m not suicidal because of all of the fun that was made out of me in school because I lied once but until you have been the subject of your own hell, being rejected from conversations by every single person in your school, having students eyes glued to you as you walked into the cafeteria, and being plastered over social media for your failed attempt at having people finally care about you. It\u2019s torturous, more than that even, it\u2019s humiliating; and frankly it\u2019s draining. That kind of hate thrown at one single person both physically and verbally is terrifying. \n\nI left school. I refused to get out of bed, refused to go outside and therefore refused to stop eating. With no school to occupy my day, I got bored, sad, depressed. And I ate more, the fridge was only steps away. Being off school didn\u2019t stop the onslaught. A year later, I still get literally 15 messages per day of people flooding me with messages about that event and that lie I created. They make new accounts each time I block them. Quite literally the only thing keeping me alive was my best friend I\u2019ve known for 15 years. Let\u2019s call him Josh. The effort he put into the friendship was at an all time low. I didn\u2019t want to lose him, he was the only person I talked  to and the only person i wanted to talk to. But, Ofcourse, my luck strikes twice in the same month and I lose him too. The worst part is, he lives 4 doors down from me, I walk past his house each time I manage to get out of the house and a flood of memories from our friendship comes flowing back, knowing damn well that I\u2019m not getting them back. Each time I see a word or a picture that reminds me of an inside joke we had sends me straight to tears. Each times I saw anything that reminded me of school makes my hands shake. \n\nTo make the fire burn brighter, my family in the house that I live in, consisting of my sister, my mum and I, is the most toxic area that I\u2019ve ever been in, barring school Ofcourse. My mother doesn\u2019t understand me, so arguments happen, she\u2019s told me she gave up on trying with me and that she doesn\u2019t care. My 18 yr old sister plays the victim when there isn\u2019t even a situation to be the victim in and I\u2019m always, and I can\u2019t stress this enough, always the bad guy. I\u2019m always in the wrong. The mental stress that this puts onto me is so tiring, I can\u2019t deal with it. I have to literally hold back tears when I am arguing with someone or when they\u2019re even just in the same room as me. But I can\u2019t leave, I\u2019m only 16, where would I go. \n\nOn August 24th, I stood over the edge of a bridge and I just wanted the slightest gush of wind to usher me over the edge. I\u2019m too scared to do it myself, but I know that in a situation that may decide my life, I know that I would be okay with dying. I am so lonely. I have no one. Nothing. I\u2019m not even allowed to go to my nearest doctors office and book an appointment on my own to talk about my depression because I\u2019m not old enough for it. This world is so fucking big, and I\u2019m so fucking small compared to this all. My own family doesn\u2019t care about me, I don\u2019t have to assume that when they have told me themselves. No one understands me, and no one understood me when I needed them the most. I know I did wrong by lying, but it was my only way I knew how to give a big enough cry for help so that someone could realise how hurt and in pain I am. \n\nI need to say before I finish this that I know whoever is going through depression and pain right now, you\u2019ll be okay in the long run, there is people who care about you. You\u2019re not me, you\u2019re not alone like I am. You are cared for. \n\nI\u2019m just sad that I wasn\u2019t able to make a loud enough cry for help.", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch"}

I didn't have any visuals. I didn't feel very different after coming down and slept really well.   \n\nI then flew back home the following day.

As you know, so much of these subjective experiences are just beyond what words are able to describe. With my eyes closed, I saw what was almost like a solar eclipse in my mind. I realized that I was the \"light\" inside me, and that the moon shadow was my ego and thoughts. I felt like this was the only time I was able to see directly what I am. And all that I am is energy/light.   \n\nThis is where things get weirder though. I saw what was a monkey/homunculus type creature in the \"shadow\". He was laughing at me saying that I had fallen for his trick. I had been listening to his thoughts for too long.   \n\nThat's when I started to cry. I (or this shadow inside me) had been so cruel to me for 25 years of life. I had believed that I was worthless, unattractive, unintelligent. But I wasn't any of those things. All I am in this light/energy. Then this shadow creature told me I don't have to take it so seriously.   \n\nThen my eyes started to move rapidly. At this point I may have been lucidly dreaming. But I was able to see all of my traumatic events in life and was able to forgive those who wronged me because I felt the sense of oneness, that those people who wronged me were really me and I could forgive myself.   \n\nI have never felt so at peace as I have after this experience.

My parents aren't being pushy at all, they WANT me to stay, but I would like to be on my own with my dog sometime soon. I save whenever I can and pay for my own gas, car insurance, groceries, vet visits, etc. I live pretty simply and, because of my dog, want to own a house with a yard. I have 25k saved and know realistically that I need a full-time job or something with benefits before becoming a homeowner.

I was hospitalized twice for suicide attempts. I currently no longer see my therapist or take medication because I was doing \"alright\" for awhile, but I'm scared to make any big changes. I'm just drifting along life right now. I think I mostly need to be re-diagnosed, as I've been thinking for a few years I have an undiagnosed mood or personality disorder. A lot of it is I can be okay for a few days, then be extremely moody and irritated. It used to be out of control and I would feel so many things change within a day, which I thought may have been rapid-cycling BPD or Bipolar. \n\nI guess I'm just terrified to confide in my parents and talk about this with them, since I'm under their insurance (United Healthcare), and they would probably have to know at least if I'm seeing a new psychiatrist? No one knows anything is up, I'm surviving, but only doing that. Not thriving if that makes sense. I want to possibly apply for SSI/SSDI though I'm scared what my parents will think, since I technically am \"functional\", maybe high-functioning depression. It's not that I can't hold down a job but the previous retail job I had for 3 years was almost full-time, very demanding and I lost myself in it. I know better about self-care now but there's still a fear. I was working myself too hard until I became an anxious mess and went from being out on the sales floor chatting it up with customers to being unable to hold a conversation.\n\nI actually enjoy working, keeping myself busy with projects, I just get worn out easily. I'm scared that I will deal with anxiety and hit rock bottom again. I do know better ways to cope now and am constantly searching for full-time jobs, most of them are customer service related. I also pet sit on the side which is money under the table, obviously not enough to live on, though it is the only job I don't feel stressed about because I'm good with animals and know what to do in certain situations. \n\nI've looked up similar questions/situations on reddit but am getting stressed because there is so much info out there.

{"post_id": "cy3f3w", "title": "Advice on how to proceed with my Ex.", "author": "AdviceYoPlz", "self_text": "Hey guys, this is a throw away account as the person in question knows my main. Me (26M) and my ex (23F) broke up about a year ago and a half ago. It was a cordial breakup, I was somewhat going through a rough patch at the time plus school which ended up stressing the relationship time wise. I understood why this relationship wasn't being fruitful. I didn't fight for the us to remain together, even though I did really like her. We stayed in touch after, and we met from time to time. We still had mutual feelings up until last Christmas (We both admitted to such), though it never went anywhere, but the interaction was pleasant and regular. I also had better control over my time in a sense. I left home for vacation, and after I came back she became distant. She took weeks to respond to  my texts, and she wouldn't pick up my calls or call back. When she did call back it was perhaps a week or so later.\n\nWe both generally maintain a low amount of friends so that we can spend quality time with them. Quality over quantity :3. She ofc doesn't owe me a anything, and that includes texting me back. I completely understand that. Though regardless, that behavior didn't set well with me. I was quite hurt and somewhat confused. She did confess to still liking me, and things were going very differently before I left for Christmas. This continued till about May after which I become fed up and blocked her on everything. Now she's an amazing person, perhaps the best soul that I had the pleasure of knowing so far. Now my phone, bless its electrical soul, tells when you get a text and it blocks it. I wavered slightly and sent her an explanation of what I was doing. I didn't think it was right to ghost her, and I was really hopping she will either give me a proper explanation or change what she was doing. She ended up trying to call me a few times, and I caved eventually. We had a very long, and fairly pleasant conversation. I didn't budge though, and when we were saying goodbye, she ended things with \"I love you\".\n\nThose three words broke my heart all over again. In the morning I decided that I will unblock her while maintaining new boundaries.  We met a few days after I believe, though I was somewhat stiff. She changed her behavior for perhaps a week and then fell back into old her old habit. Now Summer rolls in, and she goes to her family's summer house at the edge of the known world. She doesn't per say have continuous access to internet. So no communication in a sense. Over the summer I grew over her, or so I thought. School for her starts soonish, so she came back to the city, and we met the other day. The meeting goes really well, it was the most fun I had in a very long time. We in a sense spent the whole day together (We were out). I had to stay out for a while longer to handle a few things, and she left home. After she left I started to feel my heart sink, and I realized that there is no way in hell I am over her. And I somewhat spent the rest of my evening despondent. She is an amazing person, and I am super comfortable around her. We share to a great extent the same philosophies about life, about personal growth, we have similar interests. I am at least interested in what she does, and she is into some of the things I do. She is someone I can spend hours talking to and never get bored. To me she is really special. This never happened to me before lets say. She is so very much like me, the good parts at least.This hurts me like crazy, and she is someone I really wanted to keep in my life. I haven't met anyone like her, and I don't think I ever will. I just don't know what to do. I don't think our relationship can grow into a normal friendship. I am not sure if I will ever not feel something for her. To clarify something after we broke up, I had plenty of opportunities to date other people. I passed on all of them in the hopes that she might take me back again. In hindsight that perhaps was the wrong thing to do. I don't know what to do now? Should I block her for good this time and just force myself to move on? Should I tell her what I sorta told you now and take it from there? Should I keep her in my life, and sorta go into another relationship to properly get over her? I honestly don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

We clicked immediately, we hang out almost every day, she's beautiful and really easy to talk to. We went out 3 days ago and we kissed and it was amazing, I feel a connection with her I had only felt with my current girlfriend before. And she feels the same way. The thing is she left today for good, she went back to her country and the only time we know we are seeing each other again is on a work thing at the end of October that lasts for a week. We agreed to keep talking and try to make sense of all because it was really intense and fast, but I know in my heart that I want to be with her, and she has told me the same. \n\nI don't know what to do, I think I might break up with my girlfriend, but I love her a lot.

I want to begin planning my suicide.", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "I've recently turned 20, had my first suicidal thought at 11, diagnosed with depression at 15, anxiety and PTSD at 17, and I have never felt this low. I've been in  bed for 10 hours, and there's been nothing on my mind but suicide. I'm so strangely calm about it - I think I finally feel comfortable with leaving. I don't want to call the suicide hotline because they called the police on me last time I did.\n\n Please, I need someone to read this.\n\nI am trying to end a 3 and a half year relationship and I am having so much anxiety and I'm having really, really morbid thoughts. Basically the first 2 years were good, I considered it just a normal teenage relationship. The last year and a half has been hectic. \n\nShe has Borderline Personality Disorder and it's completely ruined me physically and mentally. I've been isolated from my family and friends, I've been turned into her slave. I stopped working out, I have gained a little weight and don't recognize myself in the mirror; I'm lethargic and fatigued, constantly.\n\nShe started to be seriously abusive when I was maybe 18 and a half and she was 2 years older. She started to scream at me, call me names, hit me, etc. almost every day she would scream at me, or call me an asshole or a piece of shit. All the while she would make posts on Facebook and Twitter about me.\n\nI went to hang out with a friend who isn't friends with her (the first time I've done so in about a year) because she was going back to college and I wanted to see her, and my girlfriend flipped out. She has always been pathologically jealous, but this was next level. She screamed at me, demanded I give her my phone, and wouldn't listen to me when I described her and how long I've known her (4 years), her name, details of our friendship, and where my gf has seen her.\n\nShe continued being livid so I went to hang out with my friend. On my way there, she called me and told me she figured out who she was through a \"source\" and said the girl was popular and that we never talked, and I said there were other girls with that name at my high school, and this one was a nerd. I hung up and kept driving there. While there, she blew up my phone frantically, 20+ texts about \"YOU'RE PUTTING ANOTHER GIRL BEFORE ME!\" \"I'M HAVING A PANIC ATTACK AND YOU DON'T CARE!\" \"HOW'S YOUR DATE GOING?\" and it ruined my mood. \n\nWhile I was talking to my friend, one of my gf's friends showed up and sat right behind me. I found out that this was premeditated, and that she'd been texting my girlfriend while performing espionage. I also found out that she'd been messaging two of my friends (who i met before we started dating, but are now on \"her\" side, as I've deduced by the things they said about me), unloaded all my private business and personal details on them, and sent screenshots of the girl and her name, asking who she was. I've deduced that she messaged about half a dozen people trying to figure out who the girl was.\n\nI got home and she flipped out again. She started screaming at me again and I tried talking but she wouldn't calm down. I told her I wasn't going to have her scream at me all night and that I needed to go upstairs to help my dad with something before he went to bed (true) and I tried to leave my room. She started blocking my path and continued screaming and cussing at me. She wouldn't let me past for 15 minutes and kept telling me \"HIT ME! DO IT! DO IT!\". I kept calm and finally she let me through, after screaming in my face that she was leaving me, how she hates me, wants to kill herself because of me, etc. etc.\n\nAnyway she went somewhere for 2 days and came back and left a very unapologetic note on our computer, failing to acknowledge what she did and pinning the blame on me. I left one back, telling her we'd talk when she wouldn't scream at me. We talked and I told her we had to break up and she had a mental breakdown. She started begging, saying \"I DIDN'T MEAN IT!\" and that she \"was going to get help\", but was also talking about how she wants to kill herself, how she made her parents hate her, how she was an accident, etc.\n\nThis is hard on me for a lot of reasons...\n\n1. I'm completely mentally depleted. Like, I'm a shell of my former self. She abused and damaged me so much that I've completely lost contact with who I am. I'm part of her, I'm not part of this world anymore. I don't know that I will ever be the same again. I feel almost sociopathic at this point. I feel completely disconnected from everything around me.\n\n2. In practicality - she does not have a car or a home. She drives my spare car and lives in my house. She doesn't have finances - I fed her every day when she was in school (2 years). She has impulsive spending habits, but she does have a job (Hooters style restaurant). I am afraid that she will be resourceless and commit suicide.\n\n3. She was there for me when my mom passed away (3 and a half years ago) and we have an emotional connection because of that. She helped me and my family and was with me every day.\n\nI'm really, really hurting because I realized I'm 20 and the only person I've ever had a positive relationship with is gone. My best friend of 10 years tried to ruin my life after I started dating this girl, and she was similarly abusive - we stopped talking when my mom passed, and she decided to scream at me on the day of her funeral, and then not go to it. My dad didn't talk to me until after my mom passed away, he cheated on her, was never home, always screaming, saying fuck my life, etc. My mom spent the last 3 years of her life strung out on drugs, rarely ever able to drive or speak. My older brother beat me probably weekly for 8ish years, stopping after my mom passed. My first girlfriend told our school I raped her, resulting in me dropping out sophomore year and being hospitalized.\n\nI just feel like this is the end. I'm hopeless. I've always felt like reaching for something but at this point I don't want to go anywhere. I just... I don't want to keep going. Normally I'm sad, I'm wailing, but I'm just... empty. I feel completely comfortable in proceeding with this.\n\nI wasted my youth in a horribly abusive relationship, developed no skills, lost all my friends, and for the past 2 years have made no friends in college, and mt mental state has deteriorated. I have depression, anxiety, and PTSD, and have yet to have a strong positive relationship with anyone. \n\nTime just keeps ticking and I feel less and less connected with reality each day. There are no ups and downs - it's just a constant homeostasis. I wake up, and feel the same. Empty, devoid of feeling, or life. Waiting to fall asleep.\n\nI feel stone cold, I feel like a serial killer. I don't mean that literally, the only person I want to kill is myself. I mean that I don't feel human. I feel cold, empty, stale, bored, lifeless. Robotic.\n\nThere's not even hurt anymore... there's just nothing. I don't see anything when I look in the mirror.", "subreddit": "SuicideWatch"}

I won't go into the details of it because it was the ride home (I was riding the motorcycle, now you get it huh, but so much happened while nothing did as well).\n\nMy first concert, really out of the ordinary action for myself, self diagnosed social anxious, introverted as fuck though I learnt so much socially I'd say I could be considered \"normal\" (though still better than everyone since my ego is so big), but now I dove deep into the world of festivals, shows which is not my kind of environment AT ALL on the paper, especially considering the music there (I love every type but house is not the kind of edm I live for) but now I'm trying to make a habit of dealing there, for the well being of everyone. \n\nDropped 15mg orally at 20h57 and I regret the first thing I said to my friend(though I usually don't regret things, no point you feel me), as drug enthousiast as I, \"yeah 2C-B is trash actually\" around midnight before my ride home. Visuals complimented well the lightshow and vice versa (the artist was worakls and his live orchestra btw, really amazing as I only knew his most popular remix, which had nothing to do with what I saw (heard ?) at the show. I felt empathy and the mindset felt better than LSD's, comparatively LSD (to me) is too real and 2C-B made me legitimately happy again (even though LSD might was well), I cried listening to a music because I was so happy to be able to do that, listen to music I live for.

Was never close with my nmom growing up but thought it was normalish. Went to college and seen how close my peers were with their parents, even the ones who claimed they hated/weren't close with their parents and I thought we related to each other on that level, they were still sooo much closer bonded and loving mutually towards each other. Then I was dealing with my own mental issues. Spent a lot of time watching videos on different mental illness I related to, to find out how to deal with my symptoms. Was actually I think watching tarot readings bc I really liked that a few years ago and stumbled onto  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHrNiaXf63U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHrNiaXf63U) and was like wow, and started reading up on it only to find out my relationship with my mom was weird for a reason. Also, I just went through some memories to realize they were more messed up than I thought. Its weird to me realizing its only been little over a year that I realized she was a narcissists, we've also been NC a year bc last time we fought I didn't just bend over backwards and get over it bc she always had a habit of exploding and then forgetting afterwards and just expecting me to get over everything she did while fighting. No issues get discussed, no apologies she just hurts and then acts like nothing happened and made me feel crazy for acting upset for longer periods of time. Last time we fought, I looked in her eyes and thought she was going to kill me, I saw nothing but hate and disgust in her. I've never have in my life called my mother a curse word, never got physical or threatened her, usually don't yell at all but she was always like a barking dog at me about everything when she's trying to tear me down and just making a fight more intense she always made me feel so small and scared to move. I feel like my body would go into a freeze around her bc anything I do could make it worse. Also with the narc moms there's roles assigned to the children, golden child and scapegoat. IDk what I was because my little brother was the golden child and nothing he did was wrong, everyone in my extended family knew my mom favored my lil brother and it perplexed people bc my little brother was a little shithead. I resented him so much growing up and was always jealous of the clear favoritism. My older brother was the scapegoat but he also acted out a lot and got in trouble with the law, he was often saying growing up he was blamed for everything anyway and in a way I feel bad he had that role but also he wasn't really a good person to me either so not so much. I was pretty much a maid/nanny, my mom paid very little attention to me, I was in charge of cleaning everything even up after my brothers who wouldn't do it themselves. I was in charge of watching my brothers so if they acted out I got punished for not making sure they were acting right. I was in charge of dealing with my mothers emotions, she'd cry to me or rant to me about this and that and I'd have to comfort her which is parentification which messed me up, she wouldn't ever listen to me in that way bc i wasn't of interest to her.", "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists"}

I tend to stay up late in order to avoid her, is it normal?\n\nI'll try to make it as short as I can. My mom has been pretty much abusive and manipulative since I can remember.\n\n She, herself, didn't have good parents, her mother especially was always mean to her and prefered my mom's brother to her. She always obeyed to whatever her parents said to her and did as they wished, despite having many opportunities to break from them (something that even she admits).\n\nI remember growing up as a teenager and hearing even now her \"you should gain more weight here\", \"I just want my baby to be the most beautiful\", \"if you don't do the \\_\\_\\_ thing, how men are going to be attracted to you?\". But this is just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nWe lived with her parents in the same house and because my mom had a rough relationship both with her mom and brother, fights between them were almost a daily thing. However, during these fights, my mom was never able to stand for herself/ answer them. Instead, I had to hear everything. Every time. For instance, I could literally misplace a thing and would start yelling at me but her words weren't directed at me exactly; she was speaking in the third person about me in front of me as well as listing all the comebacks she should've have said to her mom/brother. This went on for years.\n\nFast forward a few years, my grandma passed away, I am a college student now and my mom moved in with me. My life has been going absolute downhill since she moved in. The fighting (aka her yelling me) never stops. I have no privacy. And the worst thing is that she thinks that \"that's the way things should be\" e.g. going through my dairy and then making fun of me for what I'm writing there.\n\nI could go on and on, but since I am trying to getting an actual answer, I hope I gave a somewhat good idea of our dynamic.\n\nAnd yes, I know \"I am probably being subjective and remembering the bad things\" but the truth is, I tried thinking of something positive but I really couldn't find it. Every day becomes more and more unbearable. The only valid reason I see is that when she lives with me I can take her to the doctor if anything is needed etc. Speaking of which, we even went to a psychiatrist/ neurologist (due to her rare memory losses) but nope, she was fine on that department. She went to a therapist as part of her treatment and he said that indeed it was a therapy that was needed. But of course, she didn't listen cause \"what the f\\*ck do you mean I have a trauma from my parents??\"\n\nAnyways, my question is the following: What I crave the most is peace. When she is up, I am literally always tensed either. As a result, I tend to go to bed way later after her (around 4-5 am) in order to have a few quiet hours. Am I overreacting? Sometimes staying in the same room with her makes me nauseous, but am I perhaps using this as an excuse to just stay up late. I've been told by her to stop playing the victim so many times that I don't even know how am I or what I'm doing anymore...", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

This month overall has been very shit.  \n\n\nOne day my dad told me and my brother to get out of the house for a while for some unknown reason. My brother and I just went with it and went out of the house for a little bit. We drove around our neighborhood before eventually getting bored and turning back to our house. When we get back to the house we both heard shouting. So we quickly get inside.  \n\n\nMy dad was furious at my mom for something and I had no idea what it was. I just yelled at them \"What was going on\" and that is when my mom just tells me she cheated on my dad and that they are getting divorced. I never thought I would ever have to go through that pain at all. I just kept saying this couldn't be happening and I nearly broke down crying until I just sat at my desk just staring at my monitor. I was furious at everyone in that moment and I really wanted to yell but I didn't. Instead, I kept it all inside of me and just let it be.   \n\n\nWeeks have gone by, my mom and dad now seemingly have daily arguments and my dad just says to my mom that \"she is gonna get what is coming to her\" and all of this other bad stuff. I couldn't do or say anything to either of them because I was too scared to bring it up and makes things already worse then they already are. Being surrounded by a failing marriage has really done a number on my mental state.  \n\n\nI have been in a constant loop of just feeling like crap and feeling alone at some point in my day. I even started to be scared of what I can do when angry and this included self-harm. I started to feel worthless at some point and me feeling the need to compare myself to others and the things they have that I don't only adds to my pains.  \n\n\nIts like I can't even cry because I feel like no one will be there for me when it happens. The only person I can trust is my brother and even then, its hard to talk to anyone in my family about my mental state. My friends can only do so much when they aren't in front of me as well. So I have to rely on myself to pick myself back up.  \n\n\nI tried to apply to multiple jobs and they all turned me down so far. The ones that haven't may have already contacted me but I don't know the number to pick up when they call me so I just hang up. This only adds to my struggles as well because I still haven't found a job yet and I don't know if a job will help me feel better.  \n\n\nTrying to help people not be depressed is also a pain. I tried to help people not be depressed anymore but I can only do so much before my efforts seem pointless. One person I knew was clinically depressed and I wanted to help them be happy again. I didn't know it at the time but I was already doomed for failure. I kept getting more frustrated that all my efforts seemed pointless. I eventually snapped and told him that nothing I do works and that I gave up. The last thing he said to me before blocking me was \"How you feel in this doesn't matter at all. Its not about you.\" It felt like my kindness was being used and I was betrayed but looking back, I probably shouldn't have helped him but even still, I would feel guilty that I did nothing. Several people I know now are going through something and I want to help them out but it seems I can't do anything because they just want to be alone.  \n\n\nOverall, I am glad this month is over but I still feel the pains now. Just writing this post I welled up with tears and now I feel bad. The thoughts of self-harm are becoming more apparent and I haven't been to my therapist in months.", "subreddit": "depression"}

It was really enjoyable until we went out for dinner. While we were ordering or waiting for our food (I can\u2019t remember which), we started reminiscing on our high school/middle school days. I usually opt out of these conversations because my friends often bounce back and forth between the two and neither were fond experiences for me. I was raped when I was 13 by an ex-boyfriend who on top of the rape was really emotionally and verbally abusive. \n\nAs you can imagine, I opt out of those conversations for my own sanity. I try not to make it obvious that I don\u2019t want to talk about it because in the end, it\u2019s a harmless conversation and if anything, it was just good to go out again. I suffer from PTSD and anxiety so it\u2019s difficult to go out every now and then. \n\nBut during the conversation I hear her winding up some punchline for a joke. Cool, however, she starts cracking up about how terrible my exes have been \u201cattraction-wise\u201d. She proceeded to ridicule how I would wait in the hallways for him despite breaking up for the \u201cmillionth time\u201d that week, as she put it. And that if anything, I looked like a fool for even putting up with him. \n\nBelieve it or not, I wouldn\u2019t have taken this joke personally if she didn\u2019t know the full story behind him\u2014 but, she does and that\u2019s what made me completely silent. Without going in depth with it, after my ex raped me he threatened to blackmail me and spread rumors about me to the whole school if I ever left him. As a 13 year old girl at the time, of course I was mortified. I already felt so ashamed of what he did to me let alone have the whole school know about it too. It still takes me a while to admit because I have so much blame towards myself, but I was just a kid and there was nothing I could do being that young and completely traumatized. \n\nMy best friend knows that. She has seen me cry and break down into full blown fits at even just the mention of his name. Yet she made that joke and I don\u2019t know the rest of the day I was just completely shut down. In the past, she has expressed some doubt about my rape but she apologized and we moved on from there. But now I just don\u2019t know what to do or how to feel or if I\u2019m taking this too seriously. Should I stop being friends with her? Is it unfair? \n\nSummary: My best friend made a joke about my rapist who she knows about, triggered me, and is making me question our friendship.", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

This relationship has become a burden on my shoulders and I think I need to end it before our anniversary in december.\n\nThe problem is, I don't know how.\n\nFor the first year, our relationship was perfect; humorous, romantic, and we both got along really well. The issue started when I entered college and he still hasn't.  I am now a sophomore, and he's been saying for almost 8 months that he's going to start college next month, and it still hasn't happened. \n\nI've noticed within this time that he's become kind of a jerk around people in general as well as super opinionated. I had been hoping that him going back to school would remind him how to socialize without coming of rude constantly, but he never went to school, and his spending habits make me worry he never will. Neither me nor my friends are comfortable around him anymore it seems.\n\nThe issue is, we've given eachother really meaningful gifts. On our first anniversary I gave him a starmap of the night we started dating and for all holidays he's given me really expensive things and often gives me things like flowers. \n\nHow do I go about breaking up with him?

{"post_id": "cy3t2l", "title": "Is my mom a narcissist? (Opinion &amp; Advice)", "author": "psychedelic_rae1", "self_text": "So to clarify, I've come to the realization (on my own and through therapy) that my mom is abusive towards me in a mental/emotional way. I have no idea if you would consider her a narcissist or just an emotionally abusive mom. I'm not sure what I am allowed to describe here (I read the rules but still kind of confused) so I'll try to just write brief description of things she's done. I am a 27 yo female who was forced to move back home last year due to an abusive relationship which I have since gotten away from. The examples I'm giving are all from my childhood up to more recent times.\n\n1. Isolated as a child such as my mom not bothering to socialize me as a toddler and therefore not developing proper social skills. I didn't make my first friend until the end of 1st grade and only after my mother told me I would never have the guts to approach her. Socializing has always been difficult due to this and I remain socially awkward to this day.\n\n2. I was told by her growing up starting at age 11 that I needed to lose weight so that I would \"look pretty and get boys.\" Which made shopping for clothes, eating and various other normal activities hard. To clarify, at 11, I was around 5 foot and was a size 8 (maybe 120 lbs, which is super healthy for that height). This resulted in poor body image and eventually an eating disorder. Along these lines, she also made me uncomfortable in my own body by pointing out my growing chest (which I hit puberty at 11) and so early on I had trouble wearing certain shirts due to cleavage and she would constantly point it out and tell me \"no boobie shirts\". I now cover my full body so that nothing shows (boobs, butt, belly). Also along those lines, she has always projected her poor body image onto me.\n\n3. None of my friends, boyfriend's, or girlfriends have ever been \"worthy\" of her and she has complaints about every single one of them. I must admit I did make quite a few poor choices with all 3 but not all of them were bad people and some have been incredibly great friends etc with me. But she only ever sees the negative in life and in people. No matter what I tell her, she always sees something wrong with them or something they aren't doing right or \"her way.\" I have gotten into many arguments with her about this. She believes she's always right and I can never be right myself and I have \"poor judgement.\" \n\n4. I have tried multiple times to talk to her about these things and what she's said that was hurtful in the past now that I'm older and can see it for what it truly is and have the guts to speak up. She will deny everything I say and will try to make me seem crazy or delusional and it will sometimes turn into arguments. She believes she can do no wrong but at the same time will claim at other times that she was a bad mother (but she doesn't want you to confirm that, she wants you to tell her that she was not and praise her). \n\nHonestly, I could give even more examples but I think that's enough for the moment. I am willing to answer any questions, if that helps. I am also not looking for a diagnosis for her, I just want to know if it's a possibility and generally any advice on how to handle it. I've recently gotten into screaming matches with her (like just as recent as yesterday) and I've gotten to my breaking point with her abuse and I need some idea of how to handle it all until I can save up money again and move out again.

I really thought this time it would work :( Feeling disappointed in myself.\n\nTL;DR Does anyone have any ways to stop a binge from starting - especially when you aren't even hungry and just feel like you need to fill a nonexistent pit?\n\n17F, 5ft7 SW:63kg CW:63kg GW:53kg", "subreddit": "loseit"}

I\u2019m acting like a person I never thought I was over someone I dont even know if I like. I don\u2019t get it. Is it love addiction, obsession,  or do I hate myself? \n\nDated this guy for about three months. I didn\u2019t really like him in the beginning, His vanity was really offputting and I couldn\u2019t see myself with someone like that. but when he started love bombing me I was actually surprised and let my guard up a little bit. We start seeing each other regularly, but he Was always double booking me like only wanted to see me when it was convenient for him, or we would work out together etc. etc. after time I started feeling needy because I felt like my needs were not being met. It always felt like when we hung outhitting night as well have been alone. Like he would asked me to go to the gym with him or to come over and cook for him or we would go get coffee and work. \n\nI tell him I feel we need to spend more quality time, and if that means we spend less time then that is OK. Things start to change and he starts to detach. I won\u2019t hear from him a few days.. and when I do see him he\u2019s telling me that I\u2019m asking for too much or im too needy, He never wants to give me an exact time for when we are going to meet so I literally have to leave my day open,he texts less and less . it got to the point to where I just wasn\u2019t feeling good about myself so I cut it off. When I left him he didn\u2019t argue he was extremely cold about it just was like ok and gave me back my parking pass. \n\nI had one relapse when I was drinking and I ran into him, and I really wanted him to give me some attention cause I missed him so much, I tried to go home with him and he just kept rejecting my advances but the more he rejected me the more I wanted him. He complained about me latching on but really allowed it to go on if you know what I mean. He even dropped me back at my house in an Uber crying. It left me feeling really Low. I sent him a bunch of cringe lovey text messages and . And he said goodnight and never replied again. But I know I don\u2019t want to be with this person. What is wrong with me? \n\nSince then I\u2019ve been kind of obsessing over him. I\u2019ve been watching his Instagram stories from my creeper account. And lately he\u2019s been posting things that are hard to decipher, Like I can\u2019t tell if they are jabs at me. Like for instance He posted a  story hiking, which was ironic because the day we broke up we were supposed to go hiking and he canceled. He never goes hiking alone,And most recently he posted a story of breakfast and it said \u201cthanks bae\u201d. I know that he is seeing other people just from digging, And I know I have a problem and I should just stop myself from questioning why he is doing these type of things and if it is because he\u2019s trying to get at me. We were together for a while and I cooked for him all the time and he never posted pictures of it or anything like that with me or the stuff we do together. Which is why I think he\u2019s doing this because  he knows I\u2019m watching. I know there are a few girls not just one. But what joy does he get out of showing me? Is he trying to make me jealous? He doesn\u2019t even text me or try to contact me and that makes me feel like shit. Maybe I\u2019m the narcissist? But I don\u2019t think I am because I always make excuses for him. Does anyone else ever feel like this? Like they can\u2019t tell if the other person is actually as bad as they think or if it\u2019s just a defense mechanism they developed in their head because they know they\u2019re hard to deal with.. \n\nI know that they are directed towards me, I will get pleasure from that. And I think about that and I realize that it\u2019s super fucked up. Like why would him trying to make me jealous actually make me want him? I\u2019ve deleted my stalker account and stopped watching what he\u2019s doing, it\u2019s like obsessive. But I still cannot get him out of my head and it\u2019s just really hard. I feel like all this rejection, ignoring , and posting how he\u2019s like so moved on has really hurt my confidence. I\u2019ve been going to therapy and I know we\u2019re not right for each other but why can\u2019t I just happily move on from someone who I didn\u2019t really want that much in the first place, but now he just clearly doesn\u2019t want me. I keep looking back at my head and replaying things I could\u2019ve done differently in the relationship, and maybe he would be towards me like how he was in the beginning, just so sweet and always so surprising. Now I just feel like I got tricked, and I kind of blame myself because I think I didn\u2019t play the game well enough. Maybe if I had then I wouldn\u2019t be longing for him so much and I would still be in control of my own emotions.\ufffc it\u2019s been about 3 weeks since we officially broke up but it feels like months. I just want this to be over but I feel like my mind is infected. I went and looked through all our old text threads and watched the decline of the relationship, it really made me sad. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t even tell if it\u2019s him or if it\u2019s me, he always told me that I was so extremely selfish. And I know I can be selfish but I really felt like I was trying to do my best with us. I just feel so stuck.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

(below)\n\nme and her went to a party together and she got too drunk.  i drove her back to my house, fed her and got her water until she sobered up.  then i was horny &amp; drunk.  and called over one of my guy friends w benefits.  him and i ended up hanging out and talking with my female friend.   things escalated and we moved upstairs into my bed, including my female friend.  i was in the middle of the 2 of them kissing both back and fourth (i had kissed her before but in a drunk/non sexual way).  i was very turned on.  and then my guy friend moved to the middle of my best friend and I.  things stayed somewhat innocent, just kissing and she was rubbing her body on him.  but i wished it was me with her.  we ended up not having the threesome and i was surprisingly disappointed.  i want to experiment with my sexuality and she\u2019s someone i\u2019m in love with and would be comfortable doing that with.  \n\ni know that the only person who can truly tell me if i\u2019m bisexual is myself but i feel really overwhelmed and confused by my thoughts.  these thoughts are new and unfamiliar to me.  so if someone can give me any advice or opinions, it would be so helpful.  i can\u2019t talk about this with any of my family (they\u2019re very traditional and religious &amp; would lose their shit).  \n\n1. is it possible to be sexually and romantically attracted to one person (of the same sex) and not be bisexual?\n\n2. are these things i\u2019m feeling the beginning to discovering my bisexuality?\n\n3. why am i just now beginning to have these thoughts at 18?\n\nif you were able to read all of this, i truly appreciate it.  any advice or opinions ab my situation from you would be appreciated more than you know.", "subreddit": "lgbt"}

But nothing back from her. Sent a meme Thursday night, and I haven't heard back. So I just stopped.\n\nShe did start classes on Monday, which makes things hell of a lot busier, I get that. But she's out there posting on her snap story, and she's out there watching my story. Like couldn't she at least shoot me a message like \"hey I'm sorry it's been busy\"? Couldn't she have sent me a quick snap? I've explicitly told her what a shit time I'm having with the move, and part of that was because I miss her. I don't expect her to coddle me or be my emotional support animal, but her presence, if not a little support would be nice. \n\nI think this is making me second-guess a lot of the friendship because I've been pretty tolerant of how selfish she's been in the past year. I will admit, I do feel bad because I've had patches of time when I was pretty flaky during our friendship (my dad was in the hospital for a year, another close friend of mine took her life, so very emotionally nitty gritty shit), but I've really worked on fixing this in the past two years. In the past year, I've really sacrificed a lot for her. Whenever she wants I make time for her (and follow through), we always hang out by her apartment, I'm cool with her boyfriend hanging out with us,  etc. But she never does the same thing for me; its always \"Oh I'm busy that night!\", or \"Oh I don't really want to come out by you\". She's been pretty invalidating of the fact that I've been having a shit time moving because \"I'm so close\", hasn't even attempted to arrange anything to come out to visit me. On my graduation day, I wanted to get a meal with her, but she said she was \"tight on cash\" and then later posted snaps of her partying with another mutual friend of ours. Like the fuck? You couldn't have invited me or been straight up? This was shortly after I was the only person to show up to a free happy hour that she won... I've just kind of had it with the bullshit and insensitivity.\n\nI think part of it has to do with the fact that she's moved in with her boyfriend in the past year and she's extremely emotionally dependent on him and she feels no need to nourish other friendships, but yeah.\n\nSo for now. I'm leaving things. She can reach out when she's ready, but I deserve better than waiting on edge for a reply, worrying about a friendship that doesn't even pay me back.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I overreacting? Should I give in and contact her at some point?\n\nTLDR; my best friend hasn't responded to me in the past week, she's been pretty selfish in the past year, what do I do?", "subreddit": "FriendshipAdvice"}

Right before this I was extremely contemplating if I was gay or what not for the second time in my life (first time was back in middle school) and the reason I had those thoughts was because of feeling and wondering if I\u2019m not so good at my job because I didn\u2019t realize something or I was hold myself back . I do remember being pretty adamant to myself that I didn\u2019t want to be a girl. Before the convention and me thinking I am trans, a week or two before that I got into a fight with my dad about stuff unrelated to this and needless to say it was pretty intense, so I\u2019m not sure if that has anything to do with it? I\u2019ve also been viewing my own characters as trans even though I don\u2019t want to and it\u2019s getting kinda annoying.\n\nPhysically wise, the only time I\u2019ve tried cross dressing was when my mom was away trying on my moms heels though they were pretty so they didn\u2019t entirely fit and I tried put one of my moms dresses next to me last night and getting a \u201cno\u201d or \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t do this kind of feeling.\n\nIf we\u2019re looking at my childhood for any evidence, I\u2019ve (and still to this day) don\u2019t really give a crap about sports and I find them to be very boring and I\u2019ve never been the most social type of kid. There was also period in my life in middle school where I would prefer hanging out with female rather than males. Other than that I generally remember genuinely enjoying boys stuff like Spiderman and such. I also always chose the male character in a video game though I\u2019m not sure if it was the fear of my parents finding out or I genuinely wanted to play the male character. \n\nCould it be a side effect of me looking at a ton of porn? Even before I started thinking I was trans I would \u201cbeat my meat\u201d a lot and I still do.\n\nEvery time I try thinking of myself in the future I know see my self in a dress of sorts and I dunno how to feel about it.\n\nI also have a couple other questions?\n\n1. Has anyone who asked if they were trans on this subreddit before come to the conclusion they were cis?\n\n2. Could a trans women ever be fully happy without socially or physically transitioning?\n\n3. Would a Mtf trans person ever be comfortable with cosplaying a male character? I\u2019ve seen Ftm trans people cosplay female character and say they liked doing so.\n\n4.

I think my last post was about her freaking out about a fan. A few things have happened. First, she decided she wanted to make up with her son.\n\nDH and I have our own living space, which is in the basement. We were sitting and eating dinner, thankfully not doing anything else, when she decided to open the door, and waltz downstairs. She stood behind our couch and said to her son \u201cI want to get along\u201d. DH says to her that she needs to look in the mirror and that he is tired of hearing it. If she wants to get along she needs to change, not either he or I need to change. She just looked at him and said \u201cso we will get along then\u201d. DH shook his head and said you need to stop. She said okay. Can I have a hug. DH said no.\n\nSo, then she goes well I want a hug, and storm over to him and hovers over him on the couch and attempts to hug him. I\u2019m a strong believer in personal autonomy and not being touched or forced to do anything. I said oh don\u2019t touch him, he doesn\u2019t want to be touched! I further said that is not fair, don\u2019t hug him! And she stood up, looked at me and said he\u2019s my son! And I said he has personal autonomy and doesn\u2019t have to touch anyone or be touched. And she stood there and (I\u2019m not exaggerating) stomped her feet and said I have personal autonomy! I swear I just about laughed. She didn\u2019t even know what I meant. But I kept a straight face and I said you\u2019re right, you do and you also shouldn\u2019t be touched when you don\u2019t want to! And with that, off she stomped.\n\nSo things at the house are quiet because we are just carrying on. We no longer go out of our way to speak. When DH and I are asked questions we answer them, but we don\u2019t answer phone calls and texts are currently blocked. I\u2019m not rude to her, I\u2019m just ambivalent now. \n\nShe also disappeared for a few days and we weren\u2019t sure where she went but she is back again.\n\nAnd finally, the funniest part: today is DHs birthday. He and I had a nice dinner out and came home. He\u2019s out in the garage working on his car and I\u2019m inside. His mother decides to go outside into the garage and open the door. DH is NOT a patient or nice person when he\u2019s interrupted. So she opens the door and asks him if he\u2019s going to hide from her all day.\n\nAs it was told to me, he said he was just working on the car. She said I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday. He said hmmph and she walked back in the house.\n\nI find her behaviour comical. It\u2019s so pathetic that it\u2019s funny. I\u2019m just soo done with her behaviour that I no longer care about what she does. I just find it funny.", "subreddit": "JUSTNOMIL"}

{"post_id": "cy41h1", "title": "I (29F) am struggling to decide whether or not to break up with my boyfriend (32M)", "author": "th4owuhway12345", "self_text": "I've been together with my boyfriend for four years. We live together in an apartment we share with roommates in a major city.\n\nMy boyfriend is a kind, supportive, generous person. He is good to me, listens to me, is emotionally supportive, most of my friends think he's sweet and a really great guy, which he is. He owns his own business, it's been open a few years, and in that time he has spent a lot of time working. The way he has set up his business, he is busy 8-10 hours a day, six days a week, including every single Saturday and Sunday. This type of business is not an especially lucrative one, but he likes what he does, and with our incomes combined, we are somewhat financially comfortable if we live with roommates and don't want to have kids or a dog or a whole bunch of luxuries, but its unlikely the business will ever become a booming success just because of its intrinsic nature.\n\nBecause he is busy getting his business up and running, I've been picking up a lot of the slack in the relationship which means doing pretty much everything else. I'm the kind of person who can keep everything spinning; I work full time, work out, schedule time with friends, maintain the cooking (breakfast, most dinners if we're not busy that night, and prepping lunches) and cleaning (all the laundry, 95% of dishes, literally everything else), and run errands. I'm reliable and consistent, and its rare that anything falls through the cracks. I like to be busy, but I do want an equal partnership eventually, and I've told myself that I'm supporting him right now so that he can build up his business.\n\nI visited his place of business recently, and realized that the place is a mess. It was filled with months of containers full of rotting food, left over from lunches I've made and sent with him to work, dozens of coffee cups, all of this readily visible to his clients. He's been keeping client orders on post-it notes which are strewn around the place in no particular order, in overflowing stacks, crammed between equipment, etc. The place is beyond disorganized and not conducive to a functioning business.\n\nWe both realized together that he needed my help. I gathered up the old food containers and tried to do some organizing. I did some data entry for him. We sat down with the post-it notes and we tried to figure out out to sort them so he could tackle the tasks on them. He realized as we were going through them that he had lost thousands of dollars in revenue because he hadn't followed up on so many customer inquiries and requests.\n\nAt first I was just resigned to the fact that he would need my help on yet another thing, but after a few days of processing, I'm pissed. I've been hustling, maintaining my life, our life together, and aspects of his life that he should be doing himself, to free up time for him to focus on his business, and he can't even keep that together without my help. In doing everything, I've deferred spending time and energy on my own stuff. In short, I feel resentful.\n\nOn top of this, he doesn't have any instinct to do any kind of cleaning at home, and needs constant reminders to do basic functions. He doesn't brush his teeth regularly, doesn't maintain friendships (not that he's not likable, he just doesn't go out, call, or keep up with people), doesn't reliably keep a to-do list or calendar, seems almost incapable of making plans or arranging dates or my birthday party without my help. He doesn't seem to spend much energy of anything outside of his job.\n\nBUT! Again, he is kind, supportive, lovable, and a very good person. But I feel like I've grown up so much in four years, and he's just stuck in this not very adult behavior. We've talked about it a lot, but it doesn't seem to change. I feel like his mother how I have to take care of him and remind him and maintain his life for him. I hate it.\n\nDoes this sound like something you've experienced? Did you stay with them or leave them, and how do you feel about that decision today? Help.\n\nTL;DR My boyfriend is a great guy, but can't grow up and maintain his life and business.

I've been trying to set things up to move out. I graduated in May from university and have a full time job. A friend of mine decided to rent out the top part of her house as a separate furnished apartment at a good price. My mom found out and has raged at me since telling me that if I move out it will end the relationship between her and I.\n\nI'm looking for some advice/courage on moving out of the home. I'm 21, soon 22, and have just started therapy a few months ago to acknowledge the abuse that had been ongoing since I was a child from my mom. I always accepted everything as normal but I've come to realize emotional and verbal abuse had been present through my life. Now that I am more aware I have been coming more to the conclusion I need to move out and get away from the stress at home and the control and manipulation she tries to use against me. She has been fighting with me over spending time with other people more than her, claiming I must 'hate' her and hate spending time with her and that these friends I have are 'stealing' her daughter away from her. She uses every guilt tactic against me and now it's at the point she threatens me that she will never speak to me again and have no relationship if I move out or do certain things, but also says it's all my fault why we won't have a relationship and that it's me who hates her and will cut her off. \n\nAnyone have a similar experience moving out from home or advice?

Kind of long post so my bad but I need to rant. \n\nSo me and my gf have been together since we were 16 and 18, and I've been drinking very sporadically since I was about 16. My family is pretty lenient and more of a 'I'll let you mess up so you can learn and then help clean up the mess' style parenting, and they never had any problems if I'd have a few drinks here and there at family events. Since my gf and I have been together she's made it clear how she felt about drinking (not an age thing- her whole family is adamantly against drinking in any way) and for the most part there weren't many issues. She never asked me not to drink. However, as we stayed together longer and I got older, we'd argue over drinking and I always maintained the argument that my parents allow it and if there was truly a problem they would have me stop. Well I turned 21 this year and a little after my birthday I went to a bar and strip club with some friends and family and all of us got absolutely hammered and I had a few lap dances. \n\nNow, I told my gf beforehand that we were going to the bar and strip club and she didn't have an issue- didn't ask me to not drink or not to go there. I went and had a blast. As soon as I got home I told her about the lap dances and she got very angry at me for them and for drinking. This turned into a few days long fight and we very nearly broke up over it. The end result was me saying I would not drink again as she said she felt like I valued drinking over her. I didn't want her to feel like that, so it was my idea to say not to drink despite that not making me happy. \n\nI have a few friends who are a few years older than me, and one night after I promised I wouldn't drink I drank with my friends. I told my gf and she got very mad and we once again almost broke up. She views me drinking as me being peer pressured into it by friends and family and doesn't seem to understand that I drink just because I enjoy it. She maintains the argument that I can have fun without alcohol, and doesn't understand that while that is true, I like to drink anyway. \n\nThis is an argument that goes no where each time, and it just results in me saying I won't drink again even though I don't agree with it and it doesn't make me happy. I am 21, and I want to be able to go out with friends and drink. I'm not asking for acceptance to get shit faced each night. I just want to be able to drink a beer or two with friends and not have to worry about losing my gf over this. \n\nSo Reddit, how do I go about talking to my gf about this topic without causing anymore issues or making her think I prioritize drinking over her? Her stance makes me feel as if she views me as an alcoholic, when in reality I drink only 1-3 times a month with friends, if that.", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

(below)\n\nme and her went to a party together and she got too drunk.  i drove her back to my house, fed her and got her water until she sobered up.  then i was horny &amp; drunk.  and called over one of my guy friends w benefits.  him and i ended up hanging out and talking with my female friend.   things escalated and we moved upstairs into my bed, including my female friend.  i was in the middle of the 2 of them kissing both back and fourth (i had kissed her before but in a drunk/non sexual way).  i was very turned on.  and then my guy friend moved to the middle of my best friend and I.  things stayed somewhat innocent, just kissing and she was rubbing her body on him.  but i wished it was me with her.  we ended up not having the threesome and i was surprisingly disappointed.  i want to experiment with my sexuality and she\u2019s someone i\u2019m in love with and would be comfortable doing that with.  \n\ni know that the only person who can truly tell me if i\u2019m bisexual is myself but i feel really overwhelmed and confused by my thoughts.  these thoughts are new and unfamiliar to me.  so if someone can give me any advice or opinions, it would be so helpful.  i can\u2019t talk about this with any of my family (they\u2019re very traditional and religious &amp; would lose their shit).  \n\n1. is it possible to be sexually and romantically attracted to one person (of the same sex) and not be bisexual?\n\n2. are these things i\u2019m feeling the beginning to discovering my bisexuality?\n\n3. why am i just now beginning to have these thoughts at 18?\n\nif you were able to read all of this, i truly appreciate it.  any advice or opinions ab my situation from you would be appreciated more than you know.", "subreddit": "bisexual"}

She showes great care for me when this happens, which i really appreciate, but i feel like i cant invite her over to my place when i feel this way, so i often drive her back home. But today her family where not home, so she said it would be scary to stay there. ( I didnt know about the fact that she does not feel safe at home). So when i drove her home today she become distant to me, and it really seemed like she didnt want anything to do with me. But i still follow her inside. This is when i Ask her what up with the attitude and she tells my why. I suggest she can come with me home (Even tho my stomach is ill), but she refuses, because i have now taken the choice of driving her home. \n\nLike i said earlier she has had problems with an ex-boyfriends and struggle to belive people, so when i try to explain to her that i care about her she does not belive me\n\nWhat do i do?\nAnd what are your thoughts on the situation?\nAll answers will be appreicated\n\nEdit: i wrote this late tonight, so if you have any questions i might not be able to answer them for a few hours", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

I hope it's not nonsensible rambles or anything, it's late as hell and I feel like bursting apart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've almost had depression for the last almost 10 years. It was attempted to be treated about 2-3 years ago, suddenly stopped bc reasons that are not important as of now. It did leave me with trust issues, finally admitted to my doctor that isn't connected to my therapist about suicidal thoughts and everything. Cut myself the next day, felt drained the day after. Out of nowhere I felt good today, I mean I felt like shit too since I had to try my best to hide my cuts from my mother. But I feel like invincible but horrible now. I've always suffered from mood swings, especially when shit went downhill. I've been doing studies on mental illnesses for one of my stories. Everything just felt like it clicked in place, I've been chewing off my nails from what just raced through my mind. I mean, I have been diagnosed by only therapist... they can't do that right??? I mean, maybe here they can?? I've no damn idea but I feel like laughing and crying about this, I feel so damn stupid and invincible. I've always suspected it wasn't just depression that ails me, I always fucking knew it was more. But everyone refused to look deeper into it and just blamed it on my autism. I have claimed countless of times that I never had certain problems before shit hit the fan. I used to be able to keep friendships just fine, I never fucking hallucinated, I never had mood swings when shit went down. But everyone keeps insisting it's just depression, my last therapist refused to look further into my claims and just said \"I think autism and depression are enough of diagnoses\" or some shit like that. I'm starting to think it's starting to lean more towards the bipolar spectrum, or however I should call it. I've no idea what it is, maybe not bipolar itself, just something like it.

Not even the first time I had to drop out of school. I always wanted to finish school, but it took 5 fucking years to be heard at once. And even if I was heard, I got fucking nowhere, I'm back at square one. If not even worse. I want to just lay down and break shit, so much damn steam I've had to boil up over the months and years. Especially the last few months.  I'm so worn down and scared of people from it all, yet I want to work on my dreams and have friends. The devil that's lurking is just inside of me, I wish I didn't think of fucking death or hallucinated bugs all over my body and under my skin. Maybe it's just my declining sleep by now, but god damn. I needed to spew it out right now.

{"post_id": "cy45au", "title": "I (24F) settled with my ex (24M) for nine years until I finally had enough courage to leave. Five months ago I met my soulmate (19M)", "author": "BiochemKoshka", "self_text": "I was with my high school sweetheart for 9 years. I had anxious doubts on and off about our relationship. But there didn\u2019t seem to be any red flags besides that, so I didn\u2019t give my anxiety much weight. Since it was my first serious relationship, I didn\u2019t have anything to compare it to. But I found myself having an intense urge to explore other love options and be independent. Subconsciously I knew he wasn\u2019t right for me. \n\nWhen I finally let myself actually process the anxiety and take an honest look at the relationship, I realized I wasn\u2019t happy. Even though there wasn\u2019t anything majorly wrong and I considered him my best friend, I realized I had fallen out of love. I knew I fell out of love because he began to irritate me constantly. I was never excited to see him, and I felt like I was lying through my teeth if I said I loved or missed him. I looked closer and realized we didn\u2019t have anything in common. And because of this we never did anything new together. We were very different people; I am curious, mature, resourceful, ambitious, and adventurous, while he is dependent, not curious, immature, lazy, and unmotivated. \n\nRealizing all of this, I felt utterly stupid for wasting so many years being unhappy. But to my defense, my relationship seemed a million times better than my parents\u2019. I didn\u2019t have a good comparison at the time. \n\nI went back and forth between breaking up with him because I was terrified of making the wrong decision. I lost sleep and hair over it. But I made the final decision because I knew we weren\u2019t compatible and I did not want to waste anymore time. He was devastated, but I couldn\u2019t be miserable for someone else\u2019s happiness. That wouldn\u2019t be fair for either of us. \n\nOnce I broke up with him, I felt a huge relief and I could finally sleep again! When walking away from his apartment after the breakup, I felt happy, free, and lighter than I had been in years. \n\nI had a steep learning curve figuring out the dating world. I avoided an actual relationship but instead casually dated. That is, until I met someone six months post breakup. \n\nHe came to my friends house for a big Russian dinner event. We locked eyes immediately and I felt a connection. The entire night we made eye contact from across the room. I felt seen. After dinner I went over to talk to him. We kept making excuses to touch each other. Then he asked for my phone number and if I wanted to step outside for some air. I obliged and he kissed me on the porch. It felt like I was kissing someone I was in love with. \n\nHe left shortly after. But in the following days we texted incessantly. Three days after we made plans for a date and met at a park to look over the city skyline at dusk. \n\nThe view of the city lights at night was beautiful, but we couldn\u2019t keep our eyes off each other. As we talked, we had way more in common than not (keeping journals, I\u2019m Russian and he taught himself to speak Russian, both chemists, both artists, both anxious, same temperament, both extremely introverted/introspective, and the list goes on and on). It seemed like he were opposite gender versions of each other. We both commented on how it felt like it wasn\u2019t the first time we met. How this night felt really special and significant. That night we both fell in love with each other. I knew I wanted to marry him that night. Up until this point I didn\u2019t want a relationship but I was all in. \n\nHe is almost five years younger than me, which would usually be an issue for young heterosexual couples since males usually mature later. But he is exceptional and is at least as mature as I am (a 24F also mature for her age). \n\nWe have everything in common and are true best friends. He taught me what actual healthy communication looks like. He is everything I\u2019d ever want in a partner\u2014curious, mature, adventurous, emotionally intelligent, and hilarious. I wish I could yell at my younger self. There weren\u2019t any major things wrong with my ex, but there also wasn\u2019t anything right with it. Now I\u2019m with a partner\u2014my soulmate. And I could not be happier. Everything in our relation is right. \n\nOur relationship is so deep and we are so interdependent (in a healthy way) that it\u2019s impossible to explain to anyone else. It\u2019s like we can read each other\u2019s thoughts. We are always on the same page. \n\nRecently we found out we were friends with the same girl as kids (we lived 1.5 hours away growing up). \n\nNow we live together (five months since we met) and plan to get married and have kids in the future. With my ex I always doubted our relationship. I thought I was just an extremely anxious person\u2014I am. But with my partner, I haven\u2019t had a single doubt. And it feels like my life began when we met. He agrees. \n\nI met my soulmate (what I imagine people mean when they say soulmate\u2014we aren\u2019t spiritual in any way).\n\nSo, if you are having major doubts in your relationship take a step back. Don\u2019t settle because you\u2019re afraid of \u201cthrowing\u201d something away. You have no idea what your future holds. :)\n\nEdit: thank goodness I wasn\u2019t posting this for validation. I just wanted to share my story of how I ended a bad relationship and unexpectedly found my partner. \n\nI recognize I sound delusional and like I jumped into a rebound relationship.

I was diagnosed with Depression and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 6 years ago. I've come a long way since that day, even one month ago I could truthfully tell you that I was happy but now it all seems like it was simply a mirage. Its ironic that the driving force behind my journey to getting better was a failed OD attampt that took more from me than I'll ever realise. The financial burden of spending 2 weeks in hospital, the shock and trauma I put my family through. I would grow to resent it and blame myself perpetually for it but it started a journey of self discovery and recovery. I can proudly say that I am over 6 months clean, finally got off of medication for the first time in 5 years and started feeling like I was finally getting better. But I never realised that my depression stems from my own family and now that I'm aware of it, I can't unsee it. My insecurities, my constant doubt and fear of never being good enough, my lack of confidence, my own self hatred stemmed from years of feeling like the black sheep of the family, my mother's constant praise for my older sibling and disregard for me. I learnt to accept my mother's behaviour and it messed me up more than I realised. My entire personality was shaped by it and it's affecting my current relationships and academics (college student) and I feel like my entire world is crumbling around me.  I really don't know what to feel anymore, I'm just confused, angry and exhausted and each day I wake up more tired than the previous, how that's even possible I don't know.

To be honest there isn\u2019t a clear reason i\u2019m depressed but I know I\u2019m fucked in the head. I was diagnosed with clinical depression at 13 after trying to kill myself. I struggle to understand why even to this day I do these things to myself. I went through a stage of slitting my wrists with knives. I\u2019ve been smoking cannabis on and off for a year. I live in London so it\u2019s kind of pick and mix what you get off these dealers. I mainly struggle with mood swings. For example last year I was fine, happy and hyper for a week and then over a period of 20 mins out of nowhere I slit my wrists and overdosed on prescribed medicines. My mum found me semi-conscious on the kitchen table and took me to hospital where I was sectioned. I hate myself for what I do to my mum and what I put her through but I genuinely can\u2019t stop. My life now is constant swings from happy, loud and sociable to angry, depressed and aggressive. I smoked weed to deal with these swings as smoking would stabilise my mood. I receive countless abuse from peers at school for my habits and I am ostracised from people as my school is sporty and they think I\u2019m just a waste of space which is true. With school starting in a few days I\u2019ve decided to quit suddenly and ngl it\u2019s fucking killing me. I\u2019m ordering CBD flowers because I\u2019ve heard it can help with out the risk of fucking up my mess of a head even more.

Day one was easy because I was so emotionally drained that I didn't have the energy to do anything, let alone smoke. Day two was really hard, I was home alone all day and there's a pot shop (I live in Canada) a ten minute walk away from my house and I kept just counting down until it was closed and I was in the clear. Day 3 was the worst and I ended up caving and buying some, and as soon as I got stoned, the weight of the shame and guilt fell onto me. I called my sister and had her take everything out of the house for me. \n\nSo Day 1 again, that's OK!

Infact, i am even taking it another direction then astral projection, as i consider astral projection to be one of the forms of meditation.\n\nThat is if we define meditation as a state of mind where we are in a trance of purpose or kind and have an open or closed eye effect on the visual stimuli through an internal stimulation of that perception.\n\nIn the past i have experiemented with these trance and perceptive meditations and while the mentioned are well known, i have also found others that i will list here swiftly:\n\nEye open astral projection\nZone out to blindness\nMusic inspired visualizations\n3rd person wander projection\nDifferent entry astral projections\nGibberish regress displaced mentality\nTranquil dissasociative zone out\n\nHowever, none of these are the one i am currently experiementing with, because i am playing with the perception meditation, a method of inspiring psychedelic shut eye experiences. \n\nCurrently, while i actually struggle with the patience required to cause the internally created visual stimulus in vivid detail, i can manage to gain a glimpse at more psychedelic visuals.\n\nBut further , my experiments have lead me to additional utilities, firstly i have found use for eye open hallucinations in memetic interface and chance forms thus far, but also discovered a method of tuning my mind to be more aware of certain objects in the room.\n\nI am also beginning to realize that the internal visions can be given meaning purposes and used eyes open or closed and this means i can treat them as another substance in reality that can actually be more personalized then solely a spiritual or informational purpose. \n\nI have also found that , because it is hard to imagine visuals on the spot, that drawing the desired visual and then shutting the eye helps in a two fold way. \n\nFirstly it lets memory create the visual and second your vision has it already embedded when closing the eyes making manifestation swifter.\n\nI am curious to see what i can do beyond this, but i can now say that we can create visuals inside our mind through the will of observation, that can if well conceived, resemble a surreal experience.\n\nMy next goal shall be to see in another direction then forward, as while i have done this in visual thought, i have not done this in internally generated perception. \n\nAs such, i thought i'd share my current experiements solely for those who take interest in the idea, but also because it is rather interesting and fits here.\n\nI have also begun to note chemical reactions to visual stimuli, which is caused by memetic visual reaction, a beautiful image brings feelings after all and likewise to the more frightful.\n\nThis has made me presume that perception and what we see can have an effect on the brain beyond seeing, so far as to render positive or negative experiences.\n\nIf a negative picture is seen at the wrong time, it can actually increase the likely hood of retaining depresssed feelings for longer.

New member here, been a lurker for a few weeks. I had been sober for almost 7 years until this past May. I convinced myself that I could start drinking normally, obviously not the right choice. I can\u2019t tell you why I broke my sobriety, I work at a bar, have been to weddings, concerts, parties, football games and have always stayed sober. Not white knuckling it either, I genuinely enjoyed my sobriety. Anyway, like I said I started drinking this past May. Started out slow, maybe one or two drinks a week. But this past month I\u2019m on a good 1-2 bottle of wine a night. I don\u2019t drink in the mornings, but usually around the 24hr mark I get the typical shakes and anxiety. I\u2019m frustrated that I allowed myself to get to this point, but also frustrated that I was able to convince myself that I could drink normally. I know I am going to quit, because I don\u2019t want to be where I was 7 years ago (a liter of rum a day) and luckily I have the history and knowledge to know when to call it quits. I am going to do a short taper over the next few days just in case.

And I never thought I\u2019d say this, but I\u2019m so glad I did.\n\nThis is my third attempt quitting this year. I was 3 months sober in April and started back again for 4 long, stressful months. 4 months during which I wanted to blame my mood on anything but my use, of course. \n\nWhen I decided to quit earlier this month, I just felt so damn tired. I knew I deserved to feel good and so I quit once again. This time around I had zero withdrawals and only passing and very occasional cravings. My mood started improving and I was feeling confident and inspired by my sober life. At the same time, I was very wary of being triggered. So when a trigger came up last night, I consciously gave in. Yep, consciously. \n\nI allowed myself to smoke and then sat back as the observer. Immediately, I felt super relaxed (yay) and then my stomach started acting up (ugh). From there, I sat on the couch in a haze and then my skin started itching. I proceeded to eat too many snacks then scrolled on my phone til 2am. When I woke up today - and for the majority of the day - I felt like absolute shit. I was so tired, sore, lethargic, skin broken out and overall felt blah. Yet I went through my routine and eventually started to feel a bit better.\n\nSo now here I am, another 24 hours sober and I\u2019m just over it. I\u2019m playing out what would happen if I smoke again, and I truly do not want those feelings back. I tell myself I enjoy the body high, that I enjoy the deep thinking, but the reality isn\u2019t nearly as great. I become detached not only from reality but from my own self! And that\u2019s not ok for me anymore. So here I go again. Putting one foot in front of the other, and eager to welcome more energy and vitality tomorrow.

Anyhow, I go through cycles in friendships where I am really invested in one friend at a time. I am annoyed with that about myself and don\u2019t understand it, but just the same.  \nI will grow OVERLY concerned, crave attention and constantly think of the friend.... whoever the \u2018best friend\u2019 of the moment happens to be. In this case, it\u2019s my friend of almost  two years. I wait for her  texts and Facebook messages. If I don't hear from her, I\u2019m in an edgy mood until we connect, almost like my sense of worth is tied into the relationship. I never confess these things and instead internalize them. When the friend finally reaches out of her own accord, I respond like Pavlov\u2019s damn dog. I\u2019m giddy, relieved, convinced I matter. When I text at 9 am like I did today and get radio silence now twelve hours later, I\u2019m sad, worried, wondering if she\u2019s mad at me, etc.  And then if I see she\u2019s updated her Facebook without getting back to my text, these negative feelings are reinforced and I feel like I\u2019m intentionally being ignored. I start to wonder what I did wrong and essentially mentally implode. I should say (you probably can tell by now) that I have anxiety and pretty rubbish self esteem. \n\nThe friendship started out in such a good way that I was convinced it would be amazing always. This friend would be my ride or die. I was so happy because the friend was SO into me, lavish gifts to say she just adored me, etc. It felt SO good to have that friend. Not because I craved material things, but it felt so wonderful to be thought of at random times and just celebrated.  We were always together. Love tank was filled! I had always wanted a friend like that. \n\nFast forward to now... \n\nThat kind of stuff doesn\u2019t happen anymore. No more fun, impromptu plans, no more gifts. Maybe the honeymoon is over or the friendship has started to run its course. Like a two year itch.\n\nGranted, the friend has had major life change in a short amount of time\u2014 bought a house and moved in with her boyfriend in a city 45 minutes to an hour or so away, had a weight loss surgery, and works full time and goes to school full time. I don\u2019t expect to be the top dog in her life anymore, but I don\u2019t know what to do with the hurt feelings now that it just... stopped. I\u2019m afraid voicing these things aloud will just overwhelm her and make me sound like some immature schmo who doesn\u2019t know how friendships work when folks get busy. Again, it\u2019s not about the material things. Thinking of you cards/texts  have always been my love language! \n\nMore realistically? She\u2019s got a mortgage now and school debt and a host of other expenses and doesn\u2019t need to buy me anything or spend extra money to go places. Also, her WLS surgery is limiting her food choices and so I can understand not wanting to go out and be surrounded by food you can\u2019t eat.  I can wrap my mind around it, but not my feelings. \n\nI am literally forcing myself to not text her because I don\u2019t wanna feed myself with thoughts of being ignored, especially if she\u2019s just living her weekend and struggling to get the many things she needs to get done accomplished. Hell, I have things I need to do, and my energy is here. Sucks! \n\nThing is, we used to be so engaged with each other through the weekend and week that I depended on it like a drug that made me happy. Codependent, much? \n\nAlso, we work with each other! I can\u2019t just not see her, so this needs to be a mental boundary I set with myself to maintain professionalism and not be so... needy.\n\nI know I sound desperate. Help! How to detach and not be so pathetic? \n \nTL;DR: Feeling obsessed or preoccupied  with friend, missing the friendship that \u2018was\u2019..Trying to detach or steel myself to not be so sensitive.

But I'm kind of uncertain if I'm being \"healthy\" or not. I've already been kinda chubby (ok, get rid of the kinda), and I'm too afraid to check the scale, but I want to lose weight. Here's some habits that I am unsure of. I used to binge a lot, and now I've kinda slowed that down.\n\n1. Eating 2 meals a day. Sometimes these meals are mainly protein, sometimes they're mainly carbs, sometimes it's pizza, sometimes it's 2 apples. Today I just ate something that made me feel really full and I'm kind of regretting it. Sometimes I have snacks, but the snacks are mostly fruit (maybe a kind bar). If I have an entire soft drink or coffee, then that's my meal. (The strange thing is that before I went to college I like finished everything in one sitting, now I eat a tiny bag of chips over the course of 6 hours. It's weird. I actually saved a cup of soda for 2 days instead of drinking it all at once.)\n\n2. Walking briskly to class. This may initially sound ok, but the tops of my feet hurt really bad when I walk too fast. I talked to my doctor about it but she said she'd take it more seriously if I lost some weight. I looked it up online and it could mean that my feet could have tendons break in them or something? I'm kind of afraid, and don't want to talk to my doctor about it because I know she'll just say I need to lose more. Is it normal? I also like taking walks around campus at night (spooky? Unsafe? I hate walking around during the day.) but I'm worried it might make the issue worse.\n\n3. Going to bed late and getting up late. My earliest class starts at 2pm and my latest class goes till 7pm. I personally love being awake when it's dark, but I am unsure if this is healthy. Should I still do the early to bed and early to rise thing, or do I just make sure I get enough sleep?

And right now he\u2019s the only therapist in my area that takes my insurance and because of my mental health issues, therapy is necessary. Generally he has been a good therapist except this one particular issue and I find myself wanting to cancel sessions all the time. \n\nShould I just let it continue or is there way to confront him without making it so awkward that I stop going all together?\n\nUPDATE: I just want to thank everyone for their advice. It has help me come to the realization that I can\u2019t continue seeing a therapist that I\u2019m constantly on guard with. And after two years of having to defend my sexuality and he still doesn\u2019t take it seriously, the patient/therapist relationship is irrevocably ruined in my mind.

And I never once felt uncomfortable or scared. We haven't done anything like physically to each other yet because it's not logistically feasible right now, but we've been having fun just texting and enjoying each other's company and flirtatiousness.\n\nThis is the first girl that has ever shown any sort of interest in me and tonight we did something different, we masturbated to thoughts of each other and messages to each other. She sent pictures of herself (I didn't ask her to, infact when she suggested it I told her only if she's comfortable doing it) and I did the deed, but idk. \n\nI'm just really really really uncomfortable right now, and I feel a bit like crying I'm actually fighting back tears, idk why, I don't even know if I enjoyed it or not, I honestly don't know what I feel really except I know I feel scared and I have a sinking feeling in my stomach, all I really know is I'm uncomfortable, confused, scared and sad.\nAfter the whole thing, I made sure she was ok and we spoke for a bit, and she kept being really really flirty and I don't like lying to her but when she asked how I felt I told her I was happy and that I felt good, I hate lying to her or to my friends in general because it kills friendships, so I make it a point not to lie, but she's a very sensitive girl and I didn't want to hurt her feelings, telling her how I felt would have caused profuse apologies and she'd end up feeling really bad about herself.\n\nI just want advice really, is this normal? What can I do to alleviate it? Will it stop? Idk I'm just confused and scared any advice is appreciated.\n\nIt's not really sex or even a proper relationship but the people of this sub tend to give really good advice anyway and the issue is of a sexual/relationship matter.\n\nFurther things to note, I'm depressed and I take meds for it (sertraline pills if you're wondering, 50g each)\n\nI don't want to break off whatever it is we have with each other because I like her, but I feel so bad right now. I want to talk to her about it, but ik if I do I'll make her feel 10 times worse than I do right now(which will be something because I'm teary eyed right now) and I know she'll say we should break off what were doing or she'll never want to do what we did tonight again.\n\nI also can't just show her this post because ik she'll be even more hurt.\n\nFurther context; I made her cum or at least helped her while she made herself cum before she did the same for me, I was fine with the first part I liked how my words and suggestions made her feel good, but when she did the same for me afterwards, idk, I just feel like this now.\n\nAnyway that's my story, please help me, I really need help and advice I'm so confused and I just don't know what to do, it's been a day and the feeling is still bringing tears to my eyes, and I don't understand why.\n\nRelationship Length:\nFriendship: 3-4 years\nRomantic Interests: About a Month\n\nTl;Dr: After a sort of sexual encounter with a close friend turned sort of girlfriend, I feel horrible, this was yesterday and today I still feel horrible, and idk why.", "subreddit": "relationships"}

A few details changed for the same reason.\n\nMy boyfriend has Aspergers and is a very reserved person. Right from the beginning of our relationship, he was uncomfortable with any kind of PDA, even things like quick pecks on the cheek or holding hands for longer than five minutes or so.  This didn\u2019t bother me much because A) I was straight out of an abusive relationship and just happy to be with someone who treated me with kindness and respect, and B) at the time he was very affectionate to me when we were in private, which was most of the time as we\u2019re both pretty introverted.\n\nWe\u2019re now coming up on our five year anniversary, and for the most part our relationship is wonderful. It sounds corny, but I really do love him more every day. We have a very deep bond and can talk about anything together. We still have fun with each other even if we\u2019re just grocery shopping or sitting around at home. He is my best friend in the whole world and our relationship is nearly perfect.... except for this one thing.\n\nHe is not affectionate with me anymore. He has told me he only was in the beginning because he felt like that was what I wanted from him, but he doesn\u2019t enjoy physical affection and would prefer not to do it much. He does hug me (because I asked him to) and sometimes he will kiss me very quickly and with his lips puckered far away from his mouth, but that\u2019s it. If I sit too close to him on the couch or touch him in any way, he usually asks me to stop, and even when he doesn\u2019t I usually stop because it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s uncomfortable. In public he is even less comfortable with PDA than he was - he says he finds it rude because other couples being affectionate with each other disgust him so he doesn\u2019t want to put anyone else through that. If he is leaving for work and I\u2019m FaceTimeing with my sister, he makes me cover the camera up so he can very chastely kiss me goodbye.\n\nWe also haven\u2019t had sex in around 4 months. We used to have sex pretty regularly, then around a year before it stopped completely it started to dwindle off. He stopped initiating or showing much interest. I thought maybe he wasn\u2019t attracted to me anymore and asked him about it a few times and he always denied it. Then four months ago he admitted that he wasn\u2019t attracted to me, but said it was because of his depression. Then he said there were a few issues with my grooming that turned him off, so I fixed those. Lately he has said that he has started having sexual thoughts about me but isn\u2019t ready yet, and just isn\u2019t that interested in sex in general. He\u2019s made references to how his sexuality is \u201calmost nonexistent\u201d and how sex is \u201cgross\u201d.\n\nI respect his boundaries and I absolutely do not want to pressure him into doing anything he isn\u2019t comfortable with, but I hate this. It makes me feel horrible about myself, like I\u2019m completely undesirable and always have to hold part of myself back. When I talked to him about it he said \u201cjust try to remember that it\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s me\u201d. I get that but I still want to feel desired and loved. I feel like he thinks I\u2019m just horny and want to fuck, and to an extent that\u2019s true, but for me the biggest reason I want to have sex is because it\u2019s a bonding experience and I like feeling close to a partner in that way. I\u2019ve tried to explain that but he doesn\u2019t really seem to get what I mean, he says he feels we already are close without sex or affection. Meanwhile I\u2019m here writing this post because we\u2019re going out with friends who are a couple tonight and I\u2019m already dreading having to be around a couple who act more couple-y in public than we do in private.\n\nI already know people are going to tell me to break up with him, and I would be lying if I said I haven\u2019t considered it as an option. But because the relationship is so good in every other way, I don\u2019t want to break up unless I\u2019m absolutely sure we can\u2019t make it work. There are two things I particularly want to know: 1) is there a way I can talk to him about this that makes my feelings clear but also is respectful of his boundaries? And 2) if anyone else has faced similar problems in their relationship, is there a compromise that worked for you and made everyone happy?\n\nThank you in advance for all advice given.\n\nTl;dr my boyfriend is happy without affection or sex but I am not at all", "subreddit": "relationships"}

I identify as Trans male, but I haven't fully came out to everyone, so I am pretty understanding when people call me a female. But what happened yesterday was unacceptable. \nSo my crush came up to me yesterday during passing period (when I was heading to the bathroom) and told me he was down to fuck. He said he only was interested in a quick fuck after school, and planned to simply forget about it afterwards. I just shrugged and said I'd think about it, because I really liked him. I was kinda saddened by the fact that he only wanted the sex, but whatever. I thought it was a dream come true at first. I forgot to tell him I was trans, though. He then began telling me about how soft my chest must feel and how loud I must be in bed. So, I politely tell him I identify as Trans male, and this sets him off.\nSo he begins yelling at me about how there's no way I could be trans, as I really loved girly stuff in 2nd grade (he was exaggerating- I wasn't really girly or feminine at any age) and so I politely tell him again that I'm trans, and then he seemingly leaves. I head towards the male bathroom (I go in there, despite being told many times told to go to the females room) and then this is when everything goes from 0 to 100.\nI'm about to head in a stall when I start being groped by my crush, and he is grinding against me.

I left school, still feeling really uncomfortable. I don't even know why he did this.

I have been doing my best to be supportive, attentive, and readily available to them, and I think I have been able to at least be a positive and supportive voice in the storm despite living far away. I really love this person and want what is best for them, no buts or howevers.   \n\n\nSo this family member has recently, after another recent volley of trauma, been asking to come stay with me for an undetermined amount of time and.... I am extremely against this. Like I said, I love this person like a little sibling but I am in no way mentally or financially equipped to handle this person in my home right now, even for a short visit. I absolutely can not manage a manically depressed, impulsive, unemployed, physically unhealthy person with a recent (possibly ongoing) history of substance abuse as a guest in my home right now or honestly ever in that state. I am a married introvert with a demanding full time job that doesn't pay all that well and I while I will continue to support this family member in any way that I can, I CANNOT CARE FOR THEM OR PARENT THEM RIGHT NOW. My husband, who also loves this person, also does not want this for obvious reasons. While I definitely won't say yes to their repeated requests, I am really struggling with the extreme guilt of all this and I'm having a hard time balancing the 'supportive family member' role with the 'emotional dumping ground with a familial responsibility' that I'm currently in. This person recently visited a mutual family member of ours and it was a total nightmare for that person as they essentially had to play therapist and suicide watcher 24/7 for a week and a half.  I've been on edge and tense for weeks. I have moderate phone call anxiety from something I went through as a young adult that involved a lot of middle of the night phone calls with bad news and repeatedly being the go-to middle of the night phone contact is really taking an emotional toll on me. I'm losing sleep and I'm starting to lose patience (something I promised I wouldn't do with them). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe fact of the matter is that I can't fix their problems for them. A lot (probably most) of the things this person has endured are external hardships that converged in a particularly awful way, but the hard truth is that a lot of their responsive and destructive actions and behaviors as a result of these things are entirely self inflicted and I can't be the person to manage that for them - this person desperately needs professional help and usually agrees when I bridge that topic, but never actually does anything to obtain it even though they have access to it. I am so devastated for what they are going through and I live in fear that they'll harm themselves as a result, but I also am not equipped to manage this situation. They sent me a text yesterday about coming again, and this time I justdidn't respond. I feel like shit for doing that but I don't know what to say anymore because the honest truth is that I don't want that and can't handle that now or probably ever.   \n\n\nTL:DR beloved but unstable family member wants to come stay with me and I am struggling hard with the guilt of denying that because I am a) unequipped to handle the situation and b) I honestly don't want to.

He's the kind of person to question you incessantly to try to poke holes through your reasoning. I'm currently pregnant and when we found out we waited until 16 weeks to tell DH side of the family as his mother can't keep a secret or ask to share someone else's news. When we told them, StepFIL kept asking why we waited so late to tell them. I just claimed it was because we wanted to make sure it was well past the risk of miscarriage. Within 24 hours of telling them, they told everyone without even asking us if they could as predict. Today we went to brunch with them and near the end of the meal they asked what our plans were for the rest of the day. I said we didn't really have any and he mentioned they were heading down to the village. He attempted to \"ask\" us to go down as well. I agreed and it ended up being a nice visit. I'm on bedrest and technically not allowed to walk around much or even go out to eat, but things have been going well and I lay down in the car and at the village as much as I can. It gets to being around dinner time and I am getting tired and hungry and have to eat often to maintain my sugars for gestational diabetes. They have a lot of food I can't eat, and what I can eat doesn't interest me so I pass on eating dinner and honestly can't wait for it to finish as I am very hungry as well as having dinner that we need to eat at home or else throw it out. We start saying our goodbyes and everyone else is fine with us leaving yet StepFIL asks \"Oh, you aren't staying for dinner?\" I say no and he say \"Oh, how come?\" I explain briefly we have food at home that needs to be eaten and he's says\"okay\" in a really high pitched voice and turns his back away from me as we are still talking. I also explain as I already had eaten out earlier that I had to be careful with what I ate to make sure my sugars are within range and again another high pitched dismissive \"okay\". I have no desire to seek his approval, it just annoys me that we went without even intending to go and get questioned when we are ready to leave. I know this kind of behavior is mild now, but I've had a couple of interactions in the past where I firmly had to stand my ground and I wanted advice on how I can be firm yet still respectful without having to justify my decisions. I'm having a child and I'm not always going to want to do what they want and I have a right to decide for myself as does DH. I don't want this silly unnecessary confrontational behavior to continue but it will none the less, so how do I word my responses to seem like complete sentences to someone who doesn't seem to respect that we make our own decisions.

Tl:dr at the bottom. \n\nSo as far as I can tell, I\u2019ve been living with some manner of high-functioning anxiety depression mix for most of my life, and only within the last few months has that fact been illuminated for me (college pushed me over the edge during the spring semester) now I believe I\u2019m slowly losing the high functioning bit as my anxiety is starting to grow and I am becoming more emotionally unstable. \n\nAn example, and the reason I\u2019m taking the time to write out this post, is I have developed extremely negative feelings towards alcohol, despite having no real reason to. My parents weren\u2019t alcoholics, I was never pressured to drink, I never had a \u201cbad\u201d experience with it. \n\nMy girlfriend is at a party tonight with her sorority sisters and she told me that they had plans to drink tonight, and she had arranged for one of her friends that would also be there to drive her home. When she told me this, my heart immediately dropped a little. I tried to fight the feeling back and not let it grow, but as I was driving home later that day it just kept getting stronger and stronger, until it manifested into the tell-tale cold-heat feeling I get in my chest when I\u2019m anxious. This began at around 11am and I\u2019m now writing this post at 10:30pm and the feeling hasn\u2019t left me all day. At first, my mind floods with all the things that could go wrong, and then when that all subsides, I\u2019m left with a very profound sadness. All encompassing overwhelming, all because my girlfriend is drinking with her friends. \n\nAnother example of this was last weekend, when I was similarly at my friends apartment and we were drinking, I really don\u2019t like the taste but my friend made me a mixed drink which was ok and I sipped on it for most of the night. However, as the night went on I couldn\u2019t help but feel alienated. I felt totally isolated in a room full of my close friends. I was able to power through so that no one noticed but by the time I was back at my apartment I was in tears. \n\nI don\u2019t really know what to make of any of this. I don\u2019t really know what to do in the short term because I know I shouldn\u2019t feel this depressed and anxious over other people\u2019s fun and by acknowledging that I push myself further into a spiral. \n\nAnyways, if you read all the way through this rant/vent/thing, I appreciate it. I\u2019m interested to hear if anyone has had a similar experience or any other thoughts that may come to mind from my story. \n\nTl:dr when my friends drink it makes me anxious and when I think about that it makes me more anxious.", "subreddit": "Anxiety"}

{"post_id": "cy4rtg", "title": "Just need to vent", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "I just need to vent because the past week has been mentally and emotionally exhausting/destructive. Let's start with the simple stuff, work:\n\nWe've been trying to track down an issue at work for the past 2 months. Its sporadic, and all search results yield that it may be an IT issue. IT has been pushing it back over to the software side and only doing limited testing on the issue. Meanwhile, we produce logs that seem to reflect the issue back towards them. We did a few minor changes and the issue still happened. Went into a meeting the other day with them and was essentially thrown under the bus by the director saying that, essentially, the changes are too complex and I'll need help with them. I spent the next day implementing the changes, testing them, and doing code reviews. My manager wasn't happy about what he said to me and it really burnt me there. Something I've been researching, discussing, including entire departments on email chains to try and get help with, nothing - I'm one of the few (any???) at work who seemed to have the dual-sided nature of having a balanced understanding between software and IT. I was even sending the director of IT commands that he could execute from shells to mimic the behavior.\n\nAnyways, that really burnt me. Then the other day I decide to push my changes out for everyone. I received a lot of flak from many different people. I honestly didn't care. Having to be on various calls with clients, customers, and others to tell them we have a resolution (a side step that went against ITs wishes) to keep their systems functional + monitoring alerts that would wake me up at all hours of the night. Eh I was done. I pushed the change with no remorse. I let my manager know I had advised I was done with the issue a month ago when I sent him, the other leads, and the CIO an email advising I was done trying to resolve the issue and put someone else on it. Overall, he became concerned I was going to quit, he called the CIO who diffused the situation and essentially talked with everyone else to not be so... hmm.... What would be the word? Disrespectful? Disdainful? Not sure. One of the managers emailed me + others and said congrats on being the first developer to do this - in a snide manner. \n\nI left work early and remote the remainder of the day. I told my lead I wasn't sure if I would be in the next day or just take it off.\n\nAfter all that fall out, I've kept quiet, not really talking to anyone but everyone seems to be intent on asking questions, seeing how I'm doing, bringing up small talk about anything. I have a feeling people talked about what happened, so they're trying to be \"extra nice\". Something that irritates me. Don't get me wrong I understand that it shows people care right? But to the person who knows its happening, it feels patronizing.\n\nOh well, its coming up on the weekend and an order I had should be on the way right?\n\nSo I had ordered an upgrade for my PC last weekend on Amazon. It was due to be delivered on Friday. They didn't deliver it. I contacted Amazon and they said it could be delivered anywhere between Saturday-Tuesday. I inquired why and they set the delivery to Monday. Well I contacted them again advising I didn't authorize a delivery change, requested a refund for shipping, etc. They changed the delivery date to Tuesday. That was the one thing I was looking towards this weekend. I was going to take a 3 day weekend and work on some upgrades, virtual systems, and work on some personal projects. That's now out of the question. I'm very frustrated with Amazon, I have a strong disliking of them for changing my stuff without my approval. Sure I received a refund on shipping, but the fact is they didn't deliver at the end of the agreement - 5 business days.\n\nSo where does this put me? How is all of this destructive and emotionally bearing? Essentially, I'm burnt out; I feel I don't have time for myself, I'm always doing things for everyone else, I'm facing boredom at work, I don't sleep well at nights, I keep missing the gym due to sleeping in, etc. I feel like the more I do, the more I help, the more I try to do more for myself, that stress just piles on further and further. I haven't had a complete breakdown like I did at work for about 10 years. Everything's eating at me, and I just feel like I'm stuck. Let's do more reading - can't read, other things going on. Let's go to the gym in the mornings - I sleep in. Let's play games - oh I have work calls, or get pulled into watching nephew, or running around to stores to get necessities for the house. Let's get stuff in bulk - still missing something necessary/needed. Let's plan in advance - still forget certain things, even with lists, or stuff is out, or I'm running short on time as is. Even if I do find the time for myself, I'm usually so drained that I fall asleep or do something so basic and mind numbing just to remove myself from my surroundings.\n\nI'm not sure where to move forward on this. All I can do is keep pushing forward, but I'm so aggravated at everything. Little tiny things just seem to wear on me. My puppy was getting into she shouldn't be getting into; I yelled at her. I spilled my coffee, ended up pouring it out and saying screw it. I feel like my stress has hit a level where if something doesn't work, it just lights my fuse so quickly. Normally, I'm extremely patient, I wait and if small things happen its no big deal, but today and the past couple of days with the stress just compounding, every little thing is just irritating me. I know my depression and anxiety are flaring up. I'm just struggling anymore.", "subreddit": "gaybros"}

We usually visit my JNMIL there 1-2 times per year, which is fine: the kids love the lake and my husband relives fond childhood memories. I find it relaxing as long as I can spend most of my time buried in a book and don't think too hard about the state of the kitchen.\n\nWhen we leave the lake house, I always clean up after my family. Sheets get washed, beds re-made, floors vacuumed, sink and toilet cleaned, etc. \n\nThis last visit, I was putting away the vacuum and I asked JNMIL if she would like me to fold the heap of paper bags in the utility room, near where she keeps all the dry good she can't cram into her overflowing kitchen. She was surprisingly amenable, so I got to work. It wasn't long before I found the mouse droppings. A few mouse droppings- no big deal. It's a country house that is occupied sporadically, of course there are going to be mice from time to time. The utility room is right next to the kitchen, after all! \n\nI move the surrounding clutter to make sure I've gotten all the poop- and I hadn't. There was so. much. more. The floor was literally black with mouse poop. There had been a full-on infestation for some time and the mice had been living in the piles of paper bags and feasting on the stacks of expired chips and cookies. We're talking at least a litre of feces on the floor, and more in the bags and other clutter.\n\nBut I couldn't just throw everything away. That would have provoked WWIII. JNMIL needed to evaluate every item- every last mildewy flip flop, plastic tote bag, and dented can of tonic water- before it could be thrown away. \n\nA saint would have had a rough time doing this job. \n\nI am not a saint.\n\nHonestly, I was pretty disgusted at having to clean up the sea of feces, and by the thought that my kids and I had been living with it for an entire week. JNMIL picked up on my disgust and responded by gaslighting me in the most ridiculous way possible: \"I know you're not used to this\" (I grew up on a farm, I've been around lots of nice) \"and you're not a naturalist like me,\" (I'm literally a biologist) \"but you see, these are just clean little country mice. Yes, just clean little country mice.\"\n\nI put down the dust pan and went outside to get some fresh air. Wild mice may be cute and little, but their excreta are NOT clean. They are health hazards and the fact that I spent the last afternoon of my vacation cleaning them up- while being gaslighted!- is why my enthusiasm for lake house vacations is most definitely on the wane.", "subreddit": "JUSTNOMIL"}

{"post_id": "cy4tg2", "title": "Not sure I'm trans or not", "author": "throwaway535766", "self_text": " \n\nNot sure really how to start this but going to a psychologist isn't an option right now as my parents think I'm the only normal one in my family and are worried over my older sister who attempted suicide twice. Also I don't think they would be very supportive of me, as when my sister first had depression, my dad told her to kill herself so she wouldn't influence me or my younger sister. Even though they calmed down and are trying to help her the best they can, I don't think now is the right time to talk to them about this. English is not my strong suit so excuse my mistakes.\n\nWell I guess I'll basically explain why I'm just extremely confused and not sure what to do. As early as I could remember I acted more feminine and wanted to do more girly things, which could be due growing up with mostly female influences. In my family, my father was mostly gone working and I didn't have any cousins my age that were guys, the closest one was 6 years off. So I spent most of my time around two sisters, one older and one younger, and my mother who I spent most of my time with. I was often jealous of my sisters doing things that I wished I could do like paint my nails. Before I started 3rd grade I acted very girly but that soon was becoming less acceptable by my parents who kept saying \"don't act like that, you're a guy.\" I sort of realized that's not what my parents wanted and with them being extremely strict I was scared not to listen. This caused me to become extremely introverted spending most of my free time reading to get me away from reality. This continued up to early middle school when I moved to a new house. My parents become a little more lax, but I was still scared for them to find out. I started to google things about girl fashion and I started to cross-dress if I ever had the chance. I would be happy to wear the clothes for a bit but then look in the mirror and feel disgusted at myself. Going through a phase of depression and such I learned about transgender things through videos and google. Flash forward a year before high school I tried to forget all of these things. It kinda worked as I was busy with school, swim, and music. I slowly started to become really extroverted and I was making a lot of friends. I was having fun but I was trying to act masculine and stuff which made me feel off. You know the saying \"fake it til you make it?\" Well I continued it for 2 years and it sort of worked. I had periods of infatuation with a few girls, but I wouldn't call it love as it wouldn't last for more than a week or two. Finally my sophomore year of high school came around. I don't remember how or what triggered me to relapse into wishing every moment of my life to be a girl again but it happened. Maybe it was because I was held to extremely high standards and expectations compared to my sisters and I wished to get away from that. After the relapse happened, the only way I would fall asleep would be to pretend I was a girl imagining someone else holding me tight and saying sweet things. I started to think of what it would be like to date some guys if I were a girl. Though it wouldn't just be a simple thought it would be more like a whole story of meeting, falling in love, etc. And I'm actually scared of if it is true, cause I definitely do not have feminine features. I have big hands and feet, with extremely broad shoulders. I'm about 5'7 and 170 lbs, with 12% body fat (got that from when I went to PT for my shoulders). So with that you can kind of imagine that I'm very bulky for my size. Which makes me quite sad, cause maybe I never was supposed to have a chance at this. It just wasn\u2019t meant to be like how I wasn\u2019t meant to be born a girl. Maybe my feelings grew out of jealousy how much attention my sisters had compared to me, all the extra things they got to do that I couldn\u2019t, or maybe it\u2019s just because I don\u2019t have it, that I want it. I'm not really sure if I truly feel like I want to become a girl anymore, I've been doubting everything I used to believe cause maybe I just got into a habit of wanting to be a girl or I'm just thinking that it would fix all my problems. But all I can think about now is this so I want some opinions on it. This was actually really hard for me to write cause at one point I thought I was gonna take this secret with me to the grave. This is driving me crazy so I'm hoping that knowing if its real or not may help me a little.\n\nThe writing is a bit messy and stuff but it's kinda hard for me to focus right now, and I feel like even though this is how I remember it.", "subreddit": "TransSpace"}

We have lived together for almost the entire length of our relationship but recently we have both been vocal with each other that things just aren't what they used to be. We bought an apartment together (in London), I get on really well with her family, we have a lot of fun together, we have the same life ambitions and goals and want to start a family.\n\nHowever, there are several issues.\n\nOur sex life has become extremely weird and not in a good way. She is often quite adverse to having sex, and when we do it is normally incredible formulaic with next to no foreplay and its often over before it even started (this never used to be the case). I will also sometimes pay her money to have sex if she is not in the mood and I am (I'm sure this sounds incredibly fucked up but it has become normalised for us). I find her incredibly attractive and sexy and tell her this all the time, however she will never tell me that I am sexy or give me any compliments of this nature  which actually really upsets me which she is aware of. It also irritates her when I touch her too frequently, despite the fact we only see each other for a few hours a day in the evening, sometimes even less as we work different hours.\n\nThe second problem is our lack of mutual interests has become much more apparent. We both have quite different interests; I am very into going out to see music, cycling, movies and architecture which she will join me to do but this is mostly just to come along with me rather than her really deeply enjoying it. She is more into fashion/beauty type things and even then she is not really that passionate about anything which has always kind of bugged me. We also do not have the same friendship group and she will almost never come out with my friends whilst she just flat out wont invite me to go out with her when she meets her friends.\n\nLastly, we have almost no connection on a intellectual level. I am a PhD level scientist and really relish intellectual conversations which I can have with my friends but that I can't have with her. Don't get me wrong, I can talk with her like I can't do with anyone else and this is great but this is just not the same thing.\n\nOne last thing, she has tried to break up with me twice before, once near the start of the relationship citing \"we're just too different\" and once about 8 months ago because she was unhappy with the relationship but other than that the relationship as a whole has been a happy one.\n\nWhen I really think about the reasons that I like her they are simply that I am incredibly sexually attracted to her and I can just do whatever I want around her but is this enough to sustain a life long relationship? Has anyone else been in a similar situation and what did you do?\n\nEDIT: I am a 27M my partner is a 27F", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

I had recently been notified of the 7th person that I had known to have died that year and had experienced my first real heartbreak due to my inexperience and drinking. I was done, and my relationship with my family was worn-out. That night after about 8 pints, I got in a fight with my brother and got it in mind that everyone was better off without me. Sometime early in the morning, maybe 3 am, I found myself on the top level of a parking garage at my college campus, as I looked out over the city, I thought this was a good place to end it. I stood up on the ledge, closed my eyes, looked down, and decided it would be too big of a mess. I ended up going home and wrestling with my thoughts until it was time for class. Later on that day I planned on shooting myself in a park near my home but by the grace of God I was stopped by a good friend of mine who took the time to show me compassion and love. \n\nI have still struggled with alcohol, although not as badly as I did then, and I am making positive gains! \n\nI don't know why I felt compelled to share that story, I haven't ever shared it with anyone.

I never saw it coming. So far, life has become meaningless and boringly plain. People have tried to support me, I've gotten help from coworkers and friends, but nothing can fill the void. Her mother and her sister called me about two days after the \"incident\" happened. They both apologized and said that they'd do anything they could.

But I truly feel that this isn't the case this time.\n\nI (25M) met this girl (23F), we'll call her L, at my job and we went to have drink back in December after work. We talked for a while at the bar, but sparks weren't exactly flying for me - as I had just gotten out of a relationship and wasn't looking to jump right into a new one. It was pleasant but we left that night as friends and didn't talk at all after that, mostly because she went back to college to finish her degree.\nFast forward to just a couple of months ago, and L comes back to the job after moving back home. We get reunited and it\u2019s still friendly. A week passes of friendly banter - nothing serious, but one night after work, she comes up and asks if I'd like to get a drink after work. I told her that I don't drink as much anymore (personal reasons) but that I was hungry and wanted to get food, so after work we went to go get some food and a drink for her. We sat in that restaurant for hours just talking, joking and laughing. It was almost completely different than last time and I genuinely started liking her. That night ended with a hug and me asking her if I could text her the next day, she said yes. Within days, after constantly texting, she was inviting me to go out with her almost every day, whether to go swimming, go get food, or run any errands she might've had (which I never mind doing). We hung out often and it was amazing, it had been a long time since I had fallen for someone like this. Things continued like this for a month and then she went to the beach with her friends for a week. While gone, L kept telling me how was excited to see me again. And when she did come back, we got dinner and all was normal, or so I thought.\n\nThroughout the week of her return I tried to hang out with her multiple days - admittedly maybe too often, but I was very smitten...what can I say? - but if she wasn't able to, I never got upset, I just said \"okay maybe next time\". As time passed though, we hung out less, we talked less, and when we did hang out, she was less physical and very quiet. She warned me early on that she can be awkward so that's what I thought this was. It was strange, but I dealt with it, hoping it was only temporary. It continued like this for a little bit, She'd leave me on \"read\" through texts and would not text me for whole days unless I reached out first. I didn't want to pry and ask why, as I'm pretty against investigating like that (as a way not to seem crazy or desperate).\n\nThen came the tipping point: One night we went to some bars (I broke my personal rule) for some work friends who were about to leave to college - I had to get invited by the other people as L didn't invite me. The friends are two attractive females who are pretty young so they had fakes. Regardless, one of these girls was looking for free shots and was talking how she was gonna talk to guys and get hooked up. Fair enough. However, at the first bar we went to, she asked L to go help her. I don't care. It's girl stuff right? I'm not too worried so I hang back and chill. That was until I saw L and the friend dancing ON (not with) the guys they were flirting with for drinks. My heart sunk to my stomach, but I braved it thinking that she's not like that and this was a fluke....and then we went to a different bar and it happened again.\n\nAt this point, I was pretty drunk and semi-emotional and she was also very drunk too. I stopped her as we were walking out of the bar and asked her what she was doing that for and began to confront her for how shes been making me feel like shes\u2019s pushing me to the background and to dance on other guys is completely insulting. She began to cry and became non-verbal (due to being completely intoxicated). So obviously I stopped talking to her about it, called her sister using her phone and got her to come pick us up and get L home safely. I texted her that I was sorry for yelling (there was a lot of loud music so I sort of had to) and for being angry.\n\nThe next day she texted and I brought up that I think we needed to talk. She agreed, so later that day we got some coffee and talked. Essentially the conversation was just that, she felt like I was smothering her and when that happens she has a tendency to throw up walls (understandable). I apologized for being a fool the prior night and we left pretty much continuing our \u201crelationship\u201d and texting each other until she left me on \"read\" (while still being active on other social media platforms) and didnt text me at all for the next two days. At first I wanted to be understand and non-\u201csmothering\u201d but I couldn\u2019t get the image of her dancing on those guys out of my head (which she never apologized for). I had had enough, so I texted that we were through and told her to bring me my clothes that she had borrowed. We argued, and L told me she didnt feel the same about me anymore and we stopped talking for two weeks - she eventually brought my clothes by sneaking to my apartment and leaving them on the doorstep.\n\nDuring the two weeks of silence, I felt horrible. I really like this girl and to have it broken off before it really even started sucked. But towards the end, things started to get better mentally and emotionally and I began to accept  and move on....until she texted me out of the blue.\n\nShe asked me to get dinner with her so that we could talk about things and so she could apologize and that she missed me too. I - like sucker - agreed. I assumed that she wanted to break things off, but do it in a civil manner and I felt like that was a good way to go about things (we do work together after all).\n\nWhen we met up, we talked for a long while - not about the situation but about random stuff - but eventually we did talk about things and smoothed them over. I told her that I didnt ACTUALLY want to end things and she seemingly agreed and said we should take it slow.\n\nThis brings us to today: it's been a week since our meet up and nothing has changed. The level of communication is completely lacking and the conversations are brief...and incredibly boring, which is weird for me because I am a very goofy texter. I try to be, but she always responds with a no more than a sentence or a couple of words. When we weren't talking during our brief hiatus, I began to feel okay and sometimes even happy. But now that she's back in my life, I feel miserable when she's not talking to me, and I still feel like I'm just someone she talks to when she's bored or has literally no one else, because when she does talk to other people she\u2019s pretty conversational. But all I know is, I don't feel the same as when we first started and am starting to doubt if it'll go different. Unfortunately, I am still completely head-over-heels for her. And I'm not sure if I should just play it cool and wait to see how things happen, or break things off to get it over with for some ounce of happiness, however brief it is.\n\nSorry for the novel, but it honestly felt good to get this typed out (while I'm work...shhh don't tell my company they're paying me to write about my relationship problems).\n\nTL;DR: A relationship started out super hot, then fizzled and then exploded.

I just want to perpetual funk to lift!", "subreddit": "widowers"}

I have been keeping my mind off things and lost 30-40 pounds by just keeping myself busy. I just need to know whether what I am doing is right, I feel like I am alone, I moved in with my father who barely knows me with my brother who pretends to be something he isn't and the only reason I haven't thought about offing myself is because of my cats. I feel desperate and I usually start breathing heavily and have to leave a room to be alone when her death comes to mind or something about cancer. Is this normal?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Holy hell, guys, apparently my Customer Service face has them all pretty well fooled. My boss said something the other day that wasn't meant to in any way hurt my feelings or upset me, and I nodded and smiled and thanked him for the feedback even though it was destroying me a little and pissed me off.\n\nThen? Then I sat at my cubicle and cried and somehow successfully hid this, as well. I'm both really happy that I am putting out such a positive image... but also absolutely insanely frustrated that I don't seem to have the ability to stop. \n\nCan anyone relate to this?

She will eat lunch and leave her food and plates on the table the rest of the day. Take off her shoes and just leave them there. Start a game when dinner is in five minutes. I'm living at home again and the behavior I see in her is similar in many ways, and occasionally worse than the behavior I see in my cousin's three-year old. \n\nHow do I talk to her about this or remind her to clean up after herself? She's getting older but not infirm by any means. Since these are all lessons a child learns I can only imagine any reminders would be condescending (and she hates that) but I also can't speak to her as an adult because that are all skills any adult should have so I wouldn't be patient or that kind.", "subreddit": "family"}

He\u2019s just ... gone.\n\nIDK how he got out of the fenced yard.  It seems he has vanished without a trace. \n\nWe went door-to-door. Posted on FB, NextDoor, Craigslist, county shelter website. Flyers at the dog park, all the vets. Drove around and around. The neighbor girls ride their bikes up and down the street calling him, which pushes me to tears every time. I\u2019ve been to the shelter every day to check the stray kennels. \n \nWe called public works to see if they had picked up a body. Morbid I know but the situation is killing me. \n\nI just can\u2019t understand where he has gone and I can\u2019t stop crying. He has slept next to me every night since he came home from the shelter 7 years ago and now, nothing. I don\u2019t know what else to do and feel helpless.", "subreddit": "Petloss"}
