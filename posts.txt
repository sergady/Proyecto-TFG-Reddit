He is very clingy and likes me to spend all of my free time with him, unless I am spending one-on-one time with one of the kids. This has had the effect of alienating my friends over the years, to the point where the only adult interactions I have are with husband or coworkers. \n\nRecently, we got a new addition to the team at work. He is gay (22 M) and we get along very well despite our age difference. The other night, coworker invited me out for a drink after work, so I asked my husband if he minded if I stopped for a drink with coworker.  Husband flipped, said absolutely not, he\u2019s a man, it\u2019s totally inappropriate, why wasn\u2019t he invited, etc.. For context, I very rarely go out without my spouse. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I have done so over the last 7 years. \n\nHowever, I caved and invited husband along. I thought we all had a good time, but as husband and I pulled away from the pub, he started making nasty comments about coworker, calling him a \u201cdrama queen\u201d and a compulsive liar. He then tried to forbid me from spending any more time with coworker. I told husband that I like coworker, and that I will hang out with him when I please. Husband does not have to join us if he dislikes coworker so much. \n\nFast-forward to this morning, coworker is picking me up for work as a favor. Husband is in a horrible mood, talking shit about coworker (who he barely knows), and making veiled threats that he is going to go find a woman to hang out with, saying \u201cI guess I just have to show you, we\u2019ll see how you feel\u201d etc.. \n\nSo, is it inappropriate for a married woman to spend time alone with another man, even if he is not at all sexually interested in or attracted to women? Or are all opposite sex relationships forbidden once one is married, regardless of the orientation of the individuals?  \n\nTL; DR - Husband does not want me (F) to spend any time alone with a gay male coworker, and now says he is going to find a woman to spend time alone with.

I\u2019m his first relationship after a nasty divorce. He also has a kid from his marriage. I\u2019ve never been in a relationship before. I dated some in college, but nothing serious. I\u2019m sick to my stomach right now. We almost broke up in February, but we were able to work it out. We fight over my career and money. I\u2019m a teacher and only get paid 10 months out of the year and it\u2019s a huge issue for my bf. I usually get summer jobs, but even then it\u2019s a struggle to make ends meet. We\u2019ve shared finances and even accounts and loans now for about 4 years. Ive got a great family that is very supportive and sometimes helps financially. That\u2019s become a huge issue to him. He has never had a good relationship with his own family and sees my relationship with my family as childish. He tells me all the time that I\u2019ve never grown up. He got a new job which required us to move this summer. So I left my job at the end of the school year to move with him. He ended up having to change his custody too which has resulted in having less time with his son which has also been a huge stressor. We were fighting so much with everything going on that I almost didn\u2019t move. My friend warned me against it as my chance to break away with out any consequences. I contributed money out of my retirement account out of necessity for us to survive this summer and the move. I didn\u2019t get a summer job though because of the move and everything going on. He drunk called me last week while traveling for work and told me to move out. The next day he called me and we talked it through. He explained his feelings, but that he doesn\u2019t actually want me to go. He has bad anxiety and explained some of his concerns with me. We go from being good or at least better to completely falling apart again almost weekly now. I know we can\u2019t keep this up. My new job doesn\u2019t pay me for another week. He\u2019s now freaking out that as of the first of the month we\u2019re behind on rent and bills. He thinks I don\u2019t care because according to him I\u2019m a child and expect him to take care of everything. He texted me all day and tried to call me while I was at work and then accused me of ignoring our problems for not answering. I\u2019m terrified of losing him. Im scared of being alone. Im scared of having to move back home especially since my dad FINALLY retired last week. I\u2019m not going to pretend that everything is good or that I\u2019m blameless in this, but I also don\u2019t want to just give up. What do I do? \n\nTLDR; bf keeps threatening to break up after almost 5 years of dating. I\u2019m not ready to give up. Afraid to be single and move home.", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

I have reiterated my asexuality again and again throughout my teens and twenties and my parents still seem to think I'll meet a cis straight man someday who will magically make me want to settle down, get married, and have a \"normal\" heteronormative relationship, complete with 2.5 kids. \\*vomit\\*\n\nMy brother and I have never been close. I speak to him maybe two or three times a year and I haven't seen him since Christmas 2017. I really don't want him in my life because of the person he is and the way he treated me as a child, which irreparably destroyed our sibling relationship and which he still refuses to acknowledge or accept any responsibility for. He recently moved across the country for work and a few days ago he called me out of the blue just to ask how things were going (actually the main reason he called me was because he wanted information from me about something totally unrelated, but whatever). \n\nAnd like an idiot, when he asked me what's new, I blurted that I have a girlfriend now. I have no idea why I did it. I guess because I'm so happy and excited about it and I really, really like her it's so hard to keep quiet about it, but I don't think it's any of his business and I regretted it immediately. He told me congratulations, and then went running off to tattle on his little sister to mommy and daddy because, you know, that's what a mature 32-year-old man does. And then of course, I had to deal with them calling me up and prying about it.\n\nMy father has believed since I was 14 that I'm a closeted lesbian. I'm not a lesbian by definition, because I don't desire women. I try to explain that to him, but he just doesn't get it. What's even worse is he tries to mansplain what he thinks love objectively is, and how there's no such thing as love without sex, so obviously I'm either lying about my girlfriend or lying about not being a lesbian and that I've just been calling myself asexual for the last 15 years because I can't admit to being a lesbian or something. I'll tell him sexual attraction isn't necessary to be in love with someone and I don't care what parts someone has and he'll say stuff like \"no, see, that's where you're wrong\" or \"you shouldn't feel that way\", because he can't deal with the fact that the way he perceives the world isn't true for everyone. \n\nNot only that but as an adult I find it very intrusive and offensive that my parents try to talk to me about this stuff, like I'm a 13-year-old getting the heterosexual safe sex ~~talk~~ lecture all over again. It's so disrespectful and infantilizing. Like they can't just be happy for me that I've found another asexual person who will love me for me and not because they want what's in my pants. Not only that but when my brother has a girlfriend, even if he's only been dating her for a few weeks, my parents are automatically so accepting. I've been seeing my girl for over a year but apparently our relationship isn't a real one or a serious one according to them because 1) we're both chicks, and 2) we're both asexual. They're always like \"that's not a relationship, that just means you're 'just friends'.\" \n\nI just had to open my big stupid mouth. It's easy to say don't worry about what they think, and to a certain extent I don't care, but it's also so insulting the way they talk to me and about me because they refuse to believe anything I say and would still rather project their assumptions onto me.

Both jobs require me to work 12 hour shifts most days; some days even longer. By the time I get off work, I\u2019m exhausted and just don\u2019t want to go to the gym or exercise like I use to. \n\nWhen I was younger, from teenager to 20\u2019s, I could put away food. Entire pizzas by myself. 2 chicken sandwiches and a large fry from McDonalds. Entire sleeves of Oreos. Eating after 10:00 pm. I basically did everything you\u2019re not suppose to do but I was very active and athletic back then. I\u2019m 36 now. And ever since hitting my 30s, I continued to eat exactly the same but with a slower metabolism and way less activity. It began to show. By 34, I had gotten up to 241 lbs, the heaviest I\u2019ve ever been. I had a gut that protruded past my feet.  \n\nThis past New Years, I made a cliche resolution to lose weight. Since I work so much without ever really having a day off, I decided the best thing I could do is portion control when I eat. Instead of eating two McChickens and a large fry, just order one sandwich. Instead of Mac n Chz at the buffet, try some green beans instead. Put salads for late night snacks instead of Chips Ahoy cookies, \n\nThe last time I weighed myself was back in April of this past year. I was 224 lbs. Something was working but I still felt fat. A buddy of mine told me \u201cDon\u2019t care what the scale says. Just keep doing what you\u2019re doing and eventually you\u2019ll be able to see it with your own eyes.\u201d I took his advice and sold my scale in a garage sale. \n\nToday I went to the doctor for a checkup and I had to stand on a scale. I was shocked at what I saw: 205.6 lbs. I\u2019ve lost nearly 40 lbs since January doing nothing but choosing healthier options and smaller portions of food. Crazy how that works, huh? \n\nSo if you don\u2019t want to/can\u2019t exercise, then my advice is to replace the little things you love with healthier, smaller options. Take it from a guy who had soda, ranch, and mayo with basically every (large) meal. If you\u2019re use to eating a certain way, at first it may be difficult to turn down Mac N Cheese and loaded baked potatoes for healthier stuff, but eventually you will see and feel a difference. I\u2019m almost mad at myself for not exercising during this time. I probably could\u2019ve doubled my progress. \n\nAnyway, I hope this helps someone out there.", "subreddit": "loseit"}

Oddly, doing long distance platonically with my best friend in Tennessee is easier than doing this...and I feel bad because all the things I'd normally tell her, I end up telling my best friends to seek consolation because she is truly busy.

Thanks ahead of time for any advice.\n\nLast year I recognized that I'd been in a number of codependent relationships all of my life and have since been trying to fix that. Creating boundaries and whatnot.\n\nI have one last relationship to fix and would appreciate any thoughts or shared experiences. I've known a friend from college for more than a decade. There was a few years in there where I cut her (and my family) off when I was dating someone (another codependency). Otherwise, she's always been one to constantly contact me to share some ridiculous story or ask for my advice on some decision she's making. And when I say constant, it's damn near everyday. \n\nBecause I (unknowingly) was dealing with depression all the time I hated her bubbly attitude about everything, but I decided maybe I needed that contrast in my life. I thought I was just in a bad mood all the time and needed to fix my attitude. I also enjoyed being asked all the time for my input because I enjoyed being needed.\n\nHer story is that she's Indian living here alone in the US. She keeps her distance metaphorically from her family, as well, bc they're overbearing and have unreasonable expectations of her.\n\nAnywho, now I'm at this crossroads where I'm exhausted from these types of relationships. I'm hoping that she's willing to grow with me and transform our relationship. Only, I don't know how to put a positive spin on the nature of our relationship and set up boundaries for my current mental health. \n\nI don't want to talk to her everyday, or hear about the next guy she's dating (not just from her, any of my friends. They're all dumb stories and concerns imo. Why are we such dummies, tho???), or give advice about things that really don't need my validation. I do feel like she needs me too much because she's constantly trying to get my attention.\n\nAs an example,  I had to tell her last week to be specific about why she wanted me to call her rather than text \"call me\". That gives me as much anxiety as \"we need to talk\". When I asked her about it, she just wanted to catch up with me. She's done this several times. This was the first time I asked her to change her message. \n\nIn my book, our relationship is worth keeping. I've cut a lot out of people out of my life over the years, and I feel it would be immature of me not to make an effort before walking away. For what it's worth, I also recognize that I'm not the best at keeping in touch with people bc I'm too depressed or anxious to do it a lot of the time.", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

A wedding isnt about things, but this really got to me.   \nI cant uninvite her because she paid for half the wedding and can pull the plug if she wants, and if i decide to just elope and say fuck the wedding I will lose alot of family members. Because she paid for the venue and her name is on the contract she has the right to call the cops to have us removed if we use it without her, and she 100% would and will.   \nIncluded in the image is a screen shot as to why they didnt tell me about it sooner, sticking to their story that the company sent the wrong veil.  \nShe evantually threw a fit, breaking things and screaming about how she didnt want to tell me about the veil because she is '\"so terrified (op's) temper, (op)  you are just like you father!\" context: father was physically abusive and sadistic, thats a different story.  \nIve never yelled at her, or done anything remotley aggressive. I cry when she freaks out at me but thats the most. I dont want her at my wedding but my arm is twisted.   \nMy fiance is out trying to find me the veil I want in the city because he has a heart of gold. I know we wont find it but i got to love the man for offering to try.", "subreddit": "raisedbynarcissists"}

(She's 18 and I'm 21) She's from another country and I had plans to move to that country even before I met her. Anyway, recently she's been a bit closed off or \"different\". After asking what the problem was, she told me that it felt as if I was \"suffocating\" her because of the constant talking we do everyday, and I'd ask what she's doing multiple times for the day and stuff like that. That's the main problem it seems, she feels as though she doesn't have enough space to be herself so for the past few days I've been giving her space and not talking to her much, or at all during the day. We talk mostly through text-to-text chatting, she doesn't like to actually voice-chat and stuff but on the rare occasion she still does it. She doesn't talk to other people either and doesn't have many friends at all, for some extra context. I don't doubt that she loves me but I'm not sure if she's in love with me, we've had great times and we do love each other deeply but I'm not sure what to do anymore. She's sick of me asking so many questions and not giving her space throughout the days, so that's why I've been asking less things in these past few days and talking to her less but it feels like our bond is going away. (This also isn't the first time we've had serious issues, last time we had another issue unrelated to this but we worked it out)\n\ntl;dr/question: Is this normal? How much do people in online relationships actually talk to each other during the day and stuff like that? I just don't know what to do, she said that she doesn't feel sad/happy anymore and she's just \"fine\", she's at home for most of the day and usually she just does basic stuff during the day. Lately (past few days), I've been feeling really down and I'm not sure why, I don't mind giving her space but at the same time it seems like she's detaching from me and isn't telling me everything about her life like she used to.", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

My boyfriend of nearly 6 years is a chronic smoker and we both enjoyed smoking heavily throughout most of our relationship. It got to the point where I was hitting my oil pen anywhere between 5 to 20 times a day. It helped me cope with my anxiety, made food and movies more interesting, made resting easier etc.\n3 weeks ago I began to get sudden bouts of nausea and gagging. Of course, I hit my pen even more to ease these feelings, thinking I was anxious, or worse, developing a stomach infection. A week in a half later I\u2019m in the ER at 3AM due to severe vomiting, complete loss of appetite and diarrhea. I was convinced it was a horrible bacterial infection until the doctor informed me that my bloodwork, urine and CT scan all came out negative and that what I was experiencing technically \u201cwasn\u2019t a medical emergency\u201d. Already in a state of panic, when I asked what else I can do he shrugged at me and said \u201cmight take about a week but go to a GI doctor\u201d. I was traumatized and began trembling, not only from the sickness, but from the antibiotic I took giving me pins and needles and sweating hands and feet. \nI was lucky to get an appointment with a GI doctor 2 days later. At this point, I hadn\u2019t eaten at all in 3 days (I lost 7 pounds). I was so weak I could barely even walk and constantly crying from the hunger pains and fear of vomiting in public and in general. That was the day I was diagnosed with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome.\nI never thought in a million years that weed could effect me this way. CHS was thought to be very very rare but is currently rapidly on the rise with legalization, my doctor said he sees it all the time. I urge everyone to google it....it can be so violent that it can cause complications that lead to death. (Ironic enough I was always the first one to say that no one could ever die from weed). \nMy last hit was the first of this month, and today my body is almost completely back to normal for the exception of only eating 1 meal a day currently. I\u2019m slowly working back up my appetite. \nNow that I\u2019m feeling better, the disbelief is hitting me and the realization that I\u2019m dependent on THC to relax and be happier is hitting me like a train. I crave the inhale and exhale. I\u2019m afraid of how I\u2019ll react with my boyfriend continuing to smoke. I\u2019ll miss looking forward to my hits after a 9 hour shift before bed while watching YouTube videos. I\u2019m restless and bored and already trying to find a million hobbies to fill in the time. But at this point, it\u2019s not even about whether I could do it or not. I MUST I have no choice. Being an anxious person by nature, I suppose I\u2019m most afraid of how I\u2019ll cope without instant relief....and I\u2019m beginning to realize that all this time I\u2019ve just been numbing my feelings rather than dealing with them.", "subreddit": "leaves"}

We, of course, have a history. When I first met him, I came on way too strong out of a LTR that I was essentially reeling from and grasping for any kind of attention I could get. As he's an Avoidant, you can imagine this went horribly for me (His words, specifically, were \"I'm not into it\"). I also found out after a while that he was in an undefined relationship with someone who he seems to have been very hurt by (we've never talked about it outright, but I get pieces here and there) which explains his rejection. Over a few years, we both mellowed out (particularly me, finding myself after that LTR). I have always felt that we had an underlying sexual tension between us and we obviously care for each other pretty significantly (bless him for being my friend after my craziness/anxiety in the beginning). \n\nJump to now and this FWB situation. It's been a few months and he BLEW UP on me the other week about the pettiest thing on social media that was an issue in our beginning development but hasn't been for a long time. I've been referring to our Attachment Styles this whole time because--- is he fighting feels? We've had arguments before being FWB that we've calmly discussed and worked through. But this recent one felt so different and just blindsided me-- so I'm trying to figure out what could be different. The only change is our knocking boots and I'm wondering if the blow-up was him pulling back from the intimacy. I'm hesitant to say he is developing feelings because of his initial rejection. I've totally come to terms with being his friend and the sex is just an awesome bonus. \n\nAm I overthinking this? Talk me down!

{"post_id": "d075sv", "created_utc": 1567719022, "title": "Is it possible for me to help my brother?", "author": "throwawayforrshpadvc", "self_text": "I expect this will be pretty long so TL;DR: My brother is in a relationship that is emotionally abusive. My family believes it may be physically abusive as well, but we have no proof. My family is not able to contact him over phone or social media and attempts to reach him in person have been unsuccessful. None of our family (and as far as we know, any of his friends) have seen or heard from him in nearly a year. Even if we were to contact my brother, I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s at a point where he\u2019s ready to try and get himself out - he\u2019s been defensive of his wife and her abuse in the past. I know that there\u2019s probably nothing we can do to help him but it weighs on me and my family to sit and do nothing while he\u2019s suffering. \n\n(throwaway because, well, you know)\n\nMy brother married his wife about three years ago now. Before they married, they dated for about a month, and knew each other for slightly longer through online dating. They had a courtroom marriage on her birthday and didn\u2019t inform any of our family until after the fact. Not a big problem, but in hindsight the first of many red flags. \n\nI\u2019ll pause and say that there were a lot of red flags that my family either didn\u2019t realize, or didn\u2019t handle well. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t blame myself and my family for his situation but there were a lot of opportunities to help my brother see his situation for what it is and all of them were handled so, so badly. That\u2019s why I want advice to see if we can still help him or if we\u2019ve messed things up for good. I\u2019ll try not to sound too biased about his wife, but it\u2019s almost certainly going to come through in places. \n\nFor a good year and a half or so, my family had very few - if any - indications that anything was amiss in their relationships. A red flag popped up once when my brother mentioned offhand that his wife didn\u2019t like him to close the door when he went to the bathroom, and she said herself that she was suspicious of what he could be doing with the door closed. All of us were understandably shocked when we heard this, but they laughed it off, and so did we. Throughout their whole marriage, my brother has been constantly changing his phone number. I\u2019m still unclear on exactly whose idea it was to change his number all the time, but knowing what I know about his wife, it was probably her. It got to the point that the best way to contact my brother was by contacting his wife, whose contact info never changed. \n\nLater in the relationship, it started becoming apparent that my brother was unhappy. I don\u2019t know as much about this as my parents do, but apparently he would often come to visit them, would tell them that his wife was upset at him, and refuse to elaborate. Eventually, my mom, brother and I sat down with them to talk. (It was intended to be only my mom, but I was home and she asked me to listen it. While they were talking, my other brother happened to come home and join their conversation, at which point I joined too. Probably, all things considered, a bad idea - I\u2019m sure they felt cornered.) \n\nDuring the course of this talk, more of my brother\u2019s wife\u2019s controlling behavior came out. She stated that she was upset at my mother for introducing her to the wife of a family friend at a recent gathering; her logic was that my mother had drawn the woman\u2019s attention to my brother, which his wife viewed as a threat. On that day, immediately after the introduction, my brother sat in the corner with his head down and hardly spoke to anyone for the feast of the day. I want to point out here that the family friend\u2019s wife has known my brother for a decade, and nothing improper has ever occurred between them. \n\nHowever, I\u2019ll note here something important that I accidentally left out - my brother\u2019s relationship prior to his wife ended because he had cheated on his girlfriend with a close friend. On that front, I understand why his wife is paranoid, but this isn\u2019t the least of her controlling behavior. \n\nSomething else that his wife said during our talk was, verbatim, \u201cI will divorce him if he doesn\u2019t do what I say.\u201d We asked my brother if he had a problem with this, and he shrugged. He asked us why he shouldn\u2019t try to love his wife despite her flaws. We grew up in a rather traditional household and our parents taught us to always work on a relationship before considering divorce. My brother, who is probably the most religious of the family, clearly took this to heart - in maybe the wrong way. His wife said to us that she doesn\u2019t believe that this is a flaw - she doesn\u2019t believe that she has any flaws, and in fact believes that she is better than other people, including everyone else in our family. This isn\u2019t really relevant, but I\u2019m trying to give you a picture of who this person is. I\u2019m not just giving you my impression of her - I\u2019m quoting her. She said these things straight out.  \n\nAlso tangentially related, we later came to find out that his wife, at the beginning of their marriage, reached out to my brother\u2019s ex-girlfriend and told her to stay away from him. Ex-girlfriend told her she had nothing to worry about and wished them good luck. Instead of thanking her or just not saying anything, my brother\u2019s wife proceeded to write a long message completely demeaning my brother, talking at length about how pathetic she found him and how quickly she would leave him if he made her unhappy in any way. (My mom is still on friendly terms with my brother\u2019s ex-girlfriend and was sent a screenshot of this convo by her.) \n\nAfter that talk, our family\u2019s contact and relationships with my brother and his wife gradually broke down. They nearly didn\u2019t come to our other brother\u2019s wedding, and my brother\u2019s wife made it clear before arriving that they would leave if anyone said anything about their relationship. At the wedding, my brother looked like a kicked dog. He was hunched, would hardly smile, kept his head down and would hardly make eye contact with anyone. His head was shaved weirdly and he had a scab on his forehead - not necessarily signs of abuse, but really shocking for us to see him looking and acting so differently. I guess I never brought this up before but my brother has always been the clown of the family, always goofing off and making jokes. The man we saw at the wedding wasn\u2019t even comparable to the person my brother usually is. \n\nSpeaking of dogs (this will seem unrelated but stick with me), my brother and his wife have had a revolving door of dogs throughout their relationship. They usually had 5+ dogs at a time, including a dog that my brother had gotten with his ex-girlfriend. At several points in time, they left several dogs with us for a brief time before taking them back. Eventually, they left my brother\u2019s dog from his previous relationship with us and never came to visit her or pick her back up to take her home. My family was fine with this - we love the dog, and she always looked in really bad condition when they had her, underfed and not well cared for. We never demanded money for her care or asked for them to take her back because we figured she was probably better off with us, anyways. \n\nWell, after nearly a year of caring for this dog, she was briefly lost. When she was returned, my brother\u2019s wife contacted us to tell us that they would be taking the dog back. My mom begged and pleaded with them to let us keep the dog, but they were unresponsive. When they came to our home to take the dog, we had decided that we wouldn\u2019t relinquish her and made this known to them. That day I experienced violent behavior from my brother that I have never, ever seen in him before, and the confrontation escalated so badly that we had to call the police. At one point my brother attempted to stop me from calling the police; when I got away with my phone, his wife (who was, up to this point, watching him attack us with no objection) called for him to leave with her, and they left. The police took our statements; technically the only one who had grounds to press charges for domestic violence was my sister, and she was so shaken that she decided to decline. My family talked about how, despite not wanting to have our brother arrested, it may be the best way to get him out of his relationship and get him help, and my sister resolved to press charges when the detective followed up, but one never did. \n\nThat was the last time I or anyone else in my family has seen or heard from my brother or his wife. We were really shaken by his outburst but he\u2019s still our brother. Recently my parents went to their house to try and reach out to him, but were unsuccessful. They noted that there were unfamiliar cars in the driveway, so we\u2019re not even sure that they still live there. We don\u2019t want to try catching him at work because his wife works at the same company he does. \n\nWe don\u2019t know how to help him. We don\u2019t know how to contact him. We don\u2019t even know if he\u2019s okay. I know that we should have handled our interactions in the past with them way better. I know there\u2019s probably nothing we can do, but every single day I think about my brother and know that he\u2019s not happy, that he\u2019s suffering. Even if not physically, he is not being the freedom or fulfillment that he deserves from a relationship. I know this probably sounds super biased and crazy, but I know I\u2019m my gut that my brother is not in a good situation at all. Is there any way it\u2019s possible for me to help him?", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

Didn't need to study much in school, sports came easily, I could draw and paint, musically inclined, accepted into programs etc. etc...basically failure didn't happen to me. I remember failing some spelling tests back in the 2nd grade. Anytime I started struggling, my stubbornness and pride ensured that no one ever knew and I would quietly breakdown and push on. I didn't cry, I didn't show emotion, I was bubbly and personable but I didn't show anyone the pain and hurt that bubbled just underneath. Until a wonderful professor in college. It was my final year and I was struggling.....hard.  I had experienced many stressful school loads in the past, but those seemed like child\u2019s play compared to the research I was currently working through, on top of my typical studio projects. Somewhere between my 67th page of a literature review, 12th concept sketch for studio and my 8th straight day of less than 5 hours of sleep, my mind became completely overwhelmed.  During a meeting she asked about a missed checkpoint and I revealed my struggles, fully expecting to be berated  about my laziness or lack of effort I had received from my parents in the past. But, I was met with more empathy and understanding than I've ever received or had for myself. She game me a second chance and I finished school incredibly strong and with a very important lesson - ASKING FOR HELP IS OKAY.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo years ago, I had an incident and realized that my anxiety was becoming dangerous. I worried constantly and it would occasionally come out as anger towards undeserving victims. Luckily, I had become very close with some new friends and while I was upset and mad with myself, they asked if I'd ever considered talking to someone. \"No, I don't need help\"   But I really thought about it....and they helped me find someone in my area that I could go see. I've been in therapy for about a year and a half and have resolved so many issues in my life...but even in therapy I struggled to be emotional and ask for help. One early session, I was becoming increasingly aggravated at myself because I was on the verge of crying and my therapist looks at me and says \"You know, this is a safe space and I have you flanked on all sides by boxes of tissues. It's okay to cry.\" and I lost it. Now, I have empathy for people, I embrace my own emotions and don't hide them, I am able to set boundaries and am more confident than ever before. But even with all this self-improvement there has been an underlying voice saying \"You're not worthy\" and since I'm posting here I bet you can guess what that voice represented...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDing Ding Ding!!! If you said \"Weight\" you are today's big winner! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have struggled since middle school to lose weight. Mind you, I was at a fairly healthy weight in middle/high school, maybe 5-10 pounds overweight at max. but I was constantly being told \"Don't wear that, it's not flattering\" \"You can't wear those shoes/skirts/shorts because of your cankles/thighs/large calves\" (I played soccer...yeah my thighs and calves were beefed up) \"Are you sure you want to wear that?\" from my mother. She has struggled with her weight since I was born and I can now realize some of what she said was projecting onto me, but it truly destroyed my self-confidence at such a young age. I still have anxiety visiting them and freak-out and have to put make-up on before I get to their house for fear of my mom making a comment. I recently wore a new outfit I adore while visiting them and was panicked all day wondering what she thought and if people were judging me because I was \\*gasp\\* wearing shorts in summer even though there is cellulite on my legs. I honestly don't remember a time I wasn't trying to lose weight, I remember trying to count calories, doing leg lifts and crunches in bed every night, trying to develop anorexia (teenager brain wasn't always so smart), feeling the need to lose weight for any event, terrified of performing on stage, sitting in different ways so my \"gut\" wouldn't show...the list goes on. But, since my initial college struggles, I've learned that asking for help can be amazing and extremely...well...helpful. So, after getting a referral from my doctor a few months ago, I finally called and set-up my first appointment for a Medical Weight Loss program at the local hospital. They are all board certified bariatric people and have behavior therapists to help address food issues, dietitians, group therapy and different program options that they design a program for each individual based on food preferences (real food vs meal replacements) and go through an entire body composition testing and a bunch of stuff that's in the packet that I don't remember off the top of my head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know, r/loseit can be a stickler for \"Just count calories, it's math\" and I've seen that work for people and I'm soooo happy for those that can do it! But, living with my boyfriend and seeing how he and his family view food and treat themselves, I realized that how I think about food and weight isn't awesome and I want to work on my relationship with myself and be healthy and feel worthy of love. I've always tried to lose weight to look nice or from fear or judgement (parents, family, random people, myself) And I've never shared with anyone my struggles to lose weight and what I look like, yeah I may act confident but there is a very very insecure lady at my core. And I don't want to feel this way forever, I don't want to be so harsh, judgmental, and full or resent towards myself. So I asked for help. Most people struggle with weight at some point in their lives and we kinda talk about it in a superficial Mean Girls way, but really being vulnerable and open doesn't happen too often in the real world. I'm going for it, all in, and I'm not sure what to expect, but I am so loved and supported right now, that I honestly don't think I could fall even if I tried. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologies for the novel, it kind of turned into a therapeutic raving. I will keep y'all posted with my journey (if y'all aren't mean) and I am so looking forward to continuing my path of self-improvement!", "subreddit": "loseit"}

She did not curtail her spending habits, gave thousand of dollars to her family without telling me about it, and even when I was paying for almost everything she was able to rack up over $5,000  in credit card debt. She told me about that in the fall of \u201818. I went into my savings so that she would not be paying crazy interest.

This is why predators went into the Catholic Church to abuse little boys. It is why about a bazillion sports coaches did that, everyone has heard about Larry Nassar, the cases of coaches abusing males is rarer because they have successfully gotten away with it and only now are these cases starting to emerge.\n\nIf there was a predator genuinely wishing to prey upon kids, why would they transition to female?

The feeling we could only describe as when you have your first love in high school, they are all you can think about. It was both our first affairs and we were still learning how to navigate through it. \nUnfortunately, the happiness was short lived. Soon after I unexpectedly fell pregnant and it was his. He pressured me to have an abortion, HARD. As expected, he was incredibly upset, as was I, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. I told him the second I found out, which meant that I did not have time to acknowledge any of my own feelings or even cry about it. Straight away I went into defensive mode, feeling the need protect the baby. That didn't stop me from feeling increasingly guilty, I was causing a person I loved deeply this incredible hurt and the only thing that could solve it I couldn't bring myself to do. \nIn the end it didn't matter. The pregnancy ended up in miscarriage and it nearly destroyed me. This resulted in an immense feeling of resentment towards AP, but instead of talking about it I tried to ignore it. It permeated into our relationship and how I acted towards him. I couldn't bring myself to forgive him. \n\nAt the same time on his end, he was having his own issues. His family was visiting and this brought feelings of guilt that he did not share with me. He says that he was only trying to spare me from being upset,  but I believe the lack of communication was at least partially due to how I was acting towards him. \n\nIt all came to a head nearly 2 months after the miscarriage. I had been toying with the idea of ending the relationship and trying to forget it ever happened but in my own messed up way I didn't want to \"own\" the break up, I still loved him. I wanted him to man up and do it, he was clearly unhappy too and I felt that he \"owed\" me at least that after everything. So I spoke to him, told him I'd give him space to reflect on how things were and he did, we parted ways. He wanted to remain friends and in touch, I asked for NC. \n\nNC only lasted a few days at a time, never a full week. Initially I was distant, sometimes angry. One day, however, we had a heart to heart on how we were feeling at that moment in time (no mention of what had happened). I finally could see his pain and our conversation took a turn. Despite everything I was still in love with him and I HATED knowing he was suffering. So slowly our texting picked up, they were light hearted, no tension and eventually flirty. He asked me to meet up to talk when I got back from my holidays a couple of times, the second time I accepted. \n\nBy the time we did go out it hadn't been a month since we parted ways but the inevitable happen. It started off innocent enough but ended up in kissing, etc. Following this, we continued as if we were back together, but there was a serious conversation pending, one which I wasn't prepared to have yet despite his insistance. But yesterday was the day, if I have learned anything from this experience is that communication is key, even when it's painful and scary as hell. \n\nWe talked about all the above. He told me that he always is hard on himself when his family is around. He is afraid of disappointing them and felt like he was letting them down. This time apart he realised how much happier he is around me. He had mentioned in the previous heart to heart that even in work people were asking him what was going on because he withdrew from everyone. \nHe also said that all he could think about everyday was how much happier he would be elsewhere (not in his marriage) and thought about leaving but he couldn't bring himself to do that to his child. Also how every night he went to bed wishing it was me he was going to. \nIt broke my heart to see him cry and the sadness on his face. \n\nI finally opened up about how I felt and why I acted like I did and apologised. The time apart had a positive outcome. I finally allowed myself to admit that I was resentful, disappointed and incredibly angry at him. Once that happened, I was able to let it go. It was nobody's fault, we were both navigating uncharted territories and our instinctive reactions were different. I no longer have those negative feeling towards him. \n\nIt felt like a weight lifted from my shoulders to finally let it all out. It will take time to build the trust back up to where it was, but our hearts are in it. My only regret is not being open from the get go, but sometimes we need to take a step back, allow ourselves to take in those feelings and then start healing or resetting. \n\nI remember before all this happened I came across a quote \"Don't let this pain go to waste\". I never truly got it. The day I miscarried it kept popping up into my head, and it did everyday for a while. I did not know at the time how helpful and true it would become not only in that circumstance but also when I was hurting for what I thought was the end of our relationship.", "subreddit": "adultery"}

I hung up.\n\nI called an ambulance and asked them to take me to another hospital. I got a couple hours sleep in the emergency before I was woken by a clinician who spoke to me like a dog at her feet. She had made up her mind before she even met me. She told me that she wouldn't admit me, or split my care (I wasn't asking her to) and told me I could have a taxi voucher to go home or go back to the mental health group that failed me in the first place. I wanted to walk in to traffic but I was too afraid of living and being punished by her again. \n\n\nBecause I was once diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder - a diagnosis that was since discarded by doctors treating me - all of the mental health workers I have asked to admit me to psych wards in the last few days keep prattling on about studies saying people with the disorder *I don't have* do better at home. Apparently studies should make me better going back after a suicide attempt to a home where I have been beaten and raped and treated like a domestic servant.\n\nI didn't want to go home so I took the taxi in to see the mental health group. I was going to walk to the local train station and try again but I hadn't eaten or drank in so long and my legs were too tired. I wound up having to go in and talk to a worker. They did their usual where they say they care but I can't believe them now. They gave me stuff to sleep but now I'm awake again and all I want is to die.

But mentioned struggling with mental health so figured a post here focusing more about that &amp; how I got from my worst to now where I'm feeling pretty good and achieving some things I'm very proud of.\n\nSo to start off, I make YouTube videos &amp; do livestreaming, have done for a number of years now, something I really enjoy &amp; am passionate about. Earlier this year around February/March a PC building company here in the UK were on the lookout for new members for their 'Stream Team', I figured meh why the hell not apply, not really thinking I'd get anywhere (I was already suffering a little from anxiety &amp; depression but not at it's worst yet). To my surprise I was accepted! Initially I was excited but then the anxiety started to creep in even more, the thought of having to talk to all these people I didn't know as well as the 'going to events' on behalf of the company which had been mentioned &amp; the traveling along with that was really beginning to freak me out. To the point I almost quit before I even started, but I stuck in there and fought through the anxiety because I knew this was a great opportunity doing something I really enjoy.\n\nOver the next month or so my anxiety got worse, chest pains, fear of doing the simplest things like going to the shop, picking up my daughter from school. It was really getting in the way of normal life &amp; I think this is what was making me depressed along with that, just not being able to function normally or do anything. Because of this I started to not want to do anything, Including making videos or do livestreams which obviously made an impact on the promotion and work I was doing on behalf of this PC company. In the end I decided being completely honest with my contact at the company would be the best option, so I was and they were so lovely and understanding. I thought at least they're not kicking me out &amp; I really needed to get my act together to repay their kindness &amp; the opportunity.\n\nSo at this point I knew I really needed try get myself sorted so I made an appointment and went to speak to my doctor. Again they were very understanding and super helpful, they ran a few blood tests to check if it was an issue caused by anything else and put me on some medication. The blood tests by the way were terrifying to me, being 24 and never having had one, being riddled with anxiety, I almost passed out in the waiting room just at the thought of it. But as I knew deep down it was absolutely nothing to be worried about.\n\nThe tests all came back clear and now I'm still on that medication, I feel amazing. Excited about the future, positive and just enjoying life again. With that it's meant I can throw myself into my passion of making videos and doing livestreams. I've been working hard and doing my best &amp; I was rewarded with 'Streamer of the month' from the PC company, it's only a small prize, some cash and some keyboard, headset etc and it's only a little fun inside competition for the team. But honestly the best thing is that I'm just proud of how I've progressed and how I've made a change and got myself to a much better place.\n\nI'm not making this post to show off or anything like that, but to tell my story and show that it doesn't matter how bad you feel right now, with the right help, the right medication, therapy, or whatever you may need, you can get back to being YOU again, feeling good, doing good and being excited about life and the future :)\n\nSorry for any spelling mistakes it's late and I'm writing this on my phone.", "subreddit": "Anxiety"}

I was seeing a guy from my city for 3 years on/off. I originally knew of him from a friend of the family. It at first started as a date but I at the time only wanted sex and got what I wanted. He on the other hand I felt, wanted me more. He would text.. try to take me out.. look at me like I was the only girl in the room for the longest time but i was too damaged to care. I eventually just started to ghost him because I felt like I was hurting his feelings by never falling through or just being careless when he was around. A year &amp; a half in &amp; a couple months of no seeing each other I see him at the bar. We go to my house. We hook up. Month later I was pregnant &amp; he was seeing someone who was visiting from across the country. I made the decision to have an abortion which is still something I struggle with. He seen me at a public event in our city little less than a week after I did it and kept trying to have me go over, and see him. I never told him. After minutes of him being persistent I went up to him &amp; told him. He told me we would make beautiful babies and I should of kept it. Ever since this happened I\u2019ve looked at him in a totally different way. Minus our sex being the most amazing intimate and loving sex I\u2019ve ever had, I\u2019ve come to love him and constantly miss his presence. &amp; the roles have switched. We still would see each other &amp; hook up, &amp; argue all the time like we\u2019re in a relationship but he progressively has changed into basically being a fuck boy. One night he told me drunk that He\u2019s purposely trying to get me pregnant. He now has multiple girls and I try and see other people. We argue about it, we care about what we\u2019re doing if it\u2019s not w each other but at the same time he doesn\u2019t go after me like he did before &amp; I wish he did. It\u2019s come to the point where he has sex w a girl one night and me the next &amp; I found out about it one night and flipped out. It\u2019s gotten really toxic. He goes out and flirts with girls in front of me knowing I\u2019ll flip out. I\u2019m very territorial. He recently moved out of his parents house &amp; got his own place and a brand new car so I\u2019m assuming his ego is definitely boosted.  After the last fight of me finding out he had sex w a girl the night before me he texted me ending whatever it is that our situation was and told me he couldn\u2019t even take me serious... the following week I gave my attention to another guy, he saw it.. &amp; blocked me on everything. I seen him at the bar 2 weeks ago and he purposely was pretending my friends were bumping into him so he could bump into me, but never said anything to me. I\u2019ve been blocked a month now and I just miss him. I just don\u2019t know how to move on. I need advice on the entire situation. I\u2019ve never been blocked before.

Needless to say it took all my willpower to keep my jaw from hitting the floor, I felt like I had just won the lottery. Here's the catch though, looking through the mound of paperwork I received with the script, I saw there's a sheet requiring me to take a drug test to verify compliance with the regimen, understandable.

Now something large happened and things aren't the same anymore.Any advice/thoughts? [LONG]", "author": "scoobydoo2705", "self_text": "Strap yourself in boys and girls, it's gonna be a long one.. Also note that English is not my first language, so grammar may not be perfect.\n\nSo my GF (Which I will from here on out call Eve) and I have been together for over 6 years now, ever since the last years of our high school. During those years, we helped eachother through some courses and both finished high school when we were 18. We were that hopelessly-in-love couple which did absolutely everything together and enjoyed every second of it. Note that she is my first \"real\" (I've had a LDR for a year, but I can't consider that as a real relationship as we only saw eachother once and well.. it just never really went off) girlfriend.\n\nEve and I both wanted to go to university and both got accepted. These universities weren't near our parental houses (idk if that's the way you say it.. I mean the house where our parents lived and we thus grew up) but quite near eachother so after 2 years of our relationship we decided we'd rent a studio in a city in the middle of our universities.\n\nThis worked great ever since. We grew closer to eachtother, matured very quickly (taxes, running a household etc.) and thought about the future such as final city to live in, name for children, dogs, cats.. you get the idea.\n\nThen, 2 years ago, something horrible happens. We get in a quite heavy one-sided car accident and we were both hospitalized. Although I had numeral bone fractures all over my body, I recovered relatively quickly. After only 1 week in wheelchair and 2 weeks with crutches, I managed to walk on my own again and after 2 months I decided I felt good enough to return to my studies at university.\n\nHowever, Eve was not that fortunate. Although she did not have any bone fractures, she suffered from severe brain damage. She was in a artificial coma for about three weeks and had a heavy revalidation period that lasts until today, although the heaviest period ended about a year after the accident. Note that at that point I resumed my study for over half a year now. Everything I did we did in agreement. In the beginning, she was upset that she could not resume her study but instead had to revalidate, but learned to live with it shortly after.\n\nNow here comes the first bad part: I've always been your mainstream late-90's boy: gaming all day, not caring about hygiene etc. This all turned around when I met Eve; I started to shave, work out, eat responsibly, you name it. However, during that half year that I was alone in our studio, those old habits returned and I silently enjoyed it a lot. Every time I went back to my parents-in-law' house (since that was where Eve was) every weekend I looked forward to getting back to being alone. Don't get me wrong: I still thouroughly enjoyed my time with Eve, but it slowly but surely became \"less\"  enjoyable than alone time.\n\nI know many of you are already typing the comments: \" Everyone has that feeling in a relationship! \" \" Everyone likes time for him/herself! \", which I completely agree with. However, stick with me.\n\nThe worst part is.. the brain damage did not only affect cognitive functions such as concentration but also affected her personality. She became more quickly agitated, became irresponsible in social situations (not thinking about reactions from her surroundings) and became more hingy (if that's the word..) to me. Especially the latter irritated me in the beginning, and we talked about that. That improved and I learned to live with it more and more. (Note that the list of changed personality traits is much much longer, but these are the ones that are most important to me.)\n\nHowever, as time progresses, more and more changes in her personality are becoming evident and she just isn't the person anymore that I fell in love with. There are still moments which I really enjoy with her and the love certainly isn't gone, but I now feel that I am currently in a relationship which is bound to end someday. I \"tried\" to end it once, telling her exactly all this (that she felt different and that I couldn't live with that) but she plainly said 'no' and said we will work it out. Ever since, we went to a social worker together and that improved things in the beginning, but the feeling about the changed personality comes back. The last couple of times we start talking about that, I more than often get the reaction \"this is the new Eve, and we'll both have to live with it\".\n\nAs a final note I would like to add that I had the feeling that I would have ended the relationship already if it hasn't been over 6 years and there are currently so many strings attached (both emotionally, socially and financially) to breaking up multiple times, although not all the time.\n\nNow I have a really bad feeling if and when break up, since I have the feeling I would just leave her with her problems instead of mentally (and physically) helping her with them. So Reddit, I ask you: is there anything that I/we can do to perhaps save the relationship or am I currently just living a lie?  \n\n\nTL:DR Good relationship of 6 years. Had a car accident 4 years into it. GF's personality changed due to it and doesn't feel like the same person anymore.", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

He has been noticeably feeling down lately, and to be honest, so am I. For context, we are college sophomores, and I have always been much more open about personal stuff than him, even though we both are very reserved. So we were chatting casually, when the subject turned to our teenage years and school, and I ended up telling him about a bullying episode that had affected me a lot in the past, but now I am pretty much over it. His tone changed and he started to ask if I recalled some stories about a guy he knew from his town, like them hanging out and going to parties. Now, my friend has been openly gay since we started college, but dated a girl for a few years in high school and told me this dude was a close friend of hers. Then he told the guy made advances on him a few times, and once even felt my friend up when they were right beside his girlfriend. He told me how it was confusing and of course, a harassment, and that besides me, just his brother, sister-in-law and ex-boyfriend knew, and he didn't know why he told me that. I was very shocked with all the info and surprised by his openess, so I didn't say much. How can I support him? I am not sure what that confession meant, I didn't think we were this close, and I care a lot about him.", "subreddit": "askgaybros"}

I'm hoping I can get some solid advice here as I'm at a loss of what to do. \n\nFirst off a bit of background: I (29m) met my girlfriend (39f) in my last job. There was always a connection between us but it was never acted on until I left the position. And then one day there's a Facebook message from her asking me out. Great right? Well things went from there and we've slowly formed a relationship from this. We have been officially dating since the start of June but due to work only get to see each other once a week or so. \n\nWe still have not slept together.. I know she struggles with intimacy but she has previously told me when she's ready we will \"have a great sex life\". We have obviously done other things but not had sex. I'd been waiting for her to be comfortable with the thought before I pushed for it. I have only stayed over her house once as I worry she thinks I expect sex. Despite explicitly telling her this is not the case.\n\nUp until the last week or so she was very affectionate. we'd talk all the time and she'd tell me she was mad about me frequently. Discussed holidays together and future plans.\n\nAll of a sudden one day. She was not texting as much, short answers and barely getting any response. She is normally happy to hear from me and what I'm up to but now did not seem to care.. I noticed this as we went from 30-50 texts a day to about 2. So it was noticeable. I thought it best to acknowledge this so said \"you're quiet the last couple days.  is everything alright?\" She replies that she thinks we text too much and won't have anything to talk about when we see each other (never yet happened) \n\n\n We had a day out together Tuesday at the beach. We never normally get to do things like this due to out work patterns. She was different to normal, didn't want to seem to hold my hand which she normally does.  At the end of the day she blows up at me and says \"I couldn't bare to look at my phone you were texting and messaging me that much the other day. You know I've blocked people for texting me like that before. Do you want me doing that to you?!\" Etc etc. We had the opportunity to hang out at hers when we got home and she did not invite me.  And would not even kiss me goodbye. \n\nWe have not spoken since and she's made no effort to contact me aside from sending me a photo of me she took while we were together..\n\nWtf do I do Reddit? I feel like she's mad at me for caring. I'm really not a presure person either. I like my own space too but I felt like such shit for caring about someone\n\nNo events that I can place have happened.

It bugged me for a long time and got progressively worse over time like a cancer. I didn\u2019t say anything at first because I didn\u2019t want to bug him or make it seem like I was shaming him but it ate away at me. The way he would talk about other women in front of me really hurt my feelings because he didn\u2019t treat me or talk about me like I was the woman of his dreams. I cried a lot when I would get home after we hung out. He made me feel bland and boring and undesirable. Even though I did everything in my power every single day to support and love him and make him feel like a man. \n\nEventually I told him that it hurt me. He immediately defended himself by saying that \u201ceveryone else does it\u201d and \u201cno one else\u2019s girlfriend cares\u201d. But when did I become everyone else\u2019s girlfriend? I expressed to him how much it truly hurt me and how I felt cheated. To which he responded by calling me crazy in multiple ways. This same exchange happened multiple times until finally he said he was stopping and only wanted to look at pics of me. Stupidly, I believed him. For like two years. Mind you, during this time I was dealing with a lot of my own mental health problems so this just weighed on me even more. \n\nRecently he wanted to have a serious talk and revealed that he in fact had not stopped and that he had an addiction. He said he was trying to be accountable and to stop so that he wasn\u2019t lying to me anymore and so that he could be a better man. A couple of his friends had been through the same thing I guess and had talked to him about it. I was proud of him and happy to hear that he was trying to stop. I expressed that I was proud and I gave him my word to be supportive and I still have been because I know in order to beat this he needs support.. however I was angry (and I mean angry) and hurt that for a year and some change or longer he lied to me. For that whole period he wanted to have sex much less often and he couldn\u2019t really get hard. He blamed it on low T but the reality was that I didn\u2019t turn him on anymore. He was just so wrapped up in what he was watching. When I questioned him he got defensive and called me crazy as usual. I work hard to keep up a good and athletic physique and to keep up my appearance (mostly for my own happiness but still) and because I know guys appreciate that even years into a relationship because it shows you care. I always support him and love him and show him he\u2019s appreciated so it felt like a total slap in the face. \n\nI truly love him with all of my heart and I would do anything for him. He\u2019s my best friend and I think he\u2019s the most wonderful human being on the planet but this flaw hit me like a train. \n\nIn conclusion, here I am a few months after \u201cthe talk\u201d and he is immensely apologetic and he always expresses how bad he feels and when I get sad or angry about it he says he understands which is something he NEVER did before. Which to me shows growth and maturity. But then again I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m still so angry and so hurt. \n\nAdvice? Am I being reasonable?", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

I am grateful to this community for your support. Our couple's therapist helped us to see that there's still hope for us, so we're giving it another try. \n\nOne thing that's helped is that our therapist finally called out exactly why JNMIL is causing so much conflict in our lives. According to her, JNMIL has been transferring her primary attachment needs to us. In layman's terms, JNMIL is enmeshed and looks to her sons to fulfill her emotional needs. It's a HUGE relief that a professional has finally called it out in black and white terms. He doesn't fully understand the concept of being enmeshed, but he's finally admitted that there were some role reversal issues with JNMIL growing up. This is HUGE! \n\nAlso, DH's own therapist has said some things to defend JNMIL's behavior, which seemed odd. Well, she finally disclosed that she's having an issue being unbiased bc she recently became a grandmother herself, so DH is going to look for a replacement. \n\nI've written about JNMIL's  enmeshed behavior in prior posts, but here's some examples: \n\n1.  JNMIL is very pushy and insisted that I allow her to babysit LO starting when he was 1 week old. I figured she was trying to help, but I quickly realized that she just wanted alone w/LO to hold him. She clearly\nhad no interest in actually attending to his needs: She never put him down for his naps/bedtime, never followed our instructions, and disregarded our pediatrician's instructions. LO is a very chill baby, but every single time she babysat I'd come back to find him screaming his head off and JNMIL shoving a bottle in his mouth and/or passing him off to FIL. \n\n2. LO had surgery at 6 weeks and it was especially stressful for LO bc he was in a hospital hooked up to IVs and wasn't allowed to eat. Despite this, JNMIL insisted on coming to LO's hospital room the night before his surgery, lingered for two hours, and then INSISTED on getting LO out of bed to hold him. After tripping over the IVs and setting off the machines, she sat there snuggling with our sick newborn trying to get comfort and attention FROM HIM. FIL tried to make her to leave, but she angrily refused. \n\n3. During her last visit, she aggressively got into my personal space and tried to kiss me on the cheek. I blocked her because boundaries. She immediately burst into tears. However, instead of going to FIL for comfort, she waited until I was in the bathroom and then ran over to DH and cried to him about how I had \"pushed her away.\" DH told her to knock it off, thank goodness. \n\nThese are just some of many instances of JNMIL's enmeshed behavior. I'm reading \"When He's Married to Mom\" and now realize that DH is a victim of hardcore narcissistic, enmeshed parenting. DH has 2 siblings, but he got the absolute worst of it bc he was the first born, the only son for 10 years, and the first grandchild.  JNMIL forced DH into a role and seems to think that LO is going to fall into that same role. F that.  Luckily, we have a phenomenal therapist who is committed to helping us with this. \n\nEDIT: I just posted a photo of LO on the shared family folder and as usual, JNMIL liked and commented on the photo within seconds. This may be BEC, but she always comments on his appearance and it makes me uncomfortable. Other family and friends say that LO is cute, but they also comment about other things like how fast he's growing, how he's sitting up, etc. However, JNMIL only ever comments on his appearance. And when she buys him clothes, she comments on how he's going to look in the clothes. It makes me feel icky. \n\nTLDR: Our couples therapist calls out JNMIL's enmeshed behavior and DH starts to recognize that JNMIL imposed role reversal issues on him.", "subreddit": "JUSTNOMIL"}

I suppose kratom's the only drug, or even serious/chronic habit, I've ever set out to quit. I'd seen a lot of conversation w/in this sub about the vulnerability of the 2-3 month mark.. and I believe it's very real. I'm not sure it was entirely this false sense of security and/or some haphazard stab at rewarding my good behavior, but those factors diluted my perceived risk for sure. I was approaching a deadline for my final paper of my final college course, and there was an all-too-familiar communicative gap between my psychiatrist and pharmacy.. i.e. I didn't have access to my Adderall. My brain felt like a dumpster, so in a panic, I went to my local shop to pick up 10 capsules of Green Borneo (I've almost always tried to use kratom as a focusing-aid). I was up til 7am, working on my paper, but crashed before finishing the last \\~tenth of it.. The following day, for whatever f###ing reason, I picked up 30 more capsules. I completed the assignment (albeit a bit past the deadline), but I was left with excess kratom. I have some left, but have felt like a nasty, naked zombie for a couple of days now. I really hope I can refrain from buying more.\n\nWhat I learned:\n\nAt this point in time, I do not have the self-control to use kratom temporarily and/or medicinally \\[self-diagnostically\\].\n\nI have reason to believe that kratom perpetuates suicidal ideations (for me, personally). Internal dialogue of self-harm hadn't popped up much \\[perhaps at all\\] during that 3 month window. I'm a bit of an oneironaut, so before bed or immediately after waking, I like to passively observe subconscious dialogue in a semi-conscious hypnagogic state.. And the morning after relapsing, all sorts of suicidal dialogue came up (but also when I was very low-energy throughout the day). On the other hand, it's important to recognize that I was in a major stress event at the time of relapse, and very disappointed in myself afterwards.. So I'm simply suggesting this a cautionary note - as I encourage people to appreciate the confounding variables when withdrawing/relapsing/using kratom.. (independently, or when sharing their experiences in here etc). This has been a very supportive &amp; informative community for me, but there's also a sensitive scientist in me, concerned w/ how many symptoms are blindly projected onto kratom (esp. as they can discourage someone from feeling ready to quit).\n\nWith love though. Everyone's struggle here is valid. I just wish everyone the resources to make the safest and best-informed decisions for navigating their addiction. Smooches.", "subreddit": "quittingkratom"}

But it is not so. This is more of a confession than anything else. Three years ago, a young woman (17f) at the time, moved from the states to my town. I was (20m) , dealing with a bad breakup. Our mums somehow met,became good friends very quickly. and then her mum asked me if I would  like to meet her daughte, help herr find new friends here and keep her from hanging with a bad crowd. I refused, having felt unsuited for such a task. Her father was extremely abusive, I later found out, though only to the mother, which led to her parents divorcing. Three months later, my best friend, who was also 20, at the time, found her on instagram. They started hanging out, having met over a mutual friend of ours that also knew her. My friend became obsessed with her, asking me not to interfere with her life or thier relationship. I told him that I have never met the girl in person and I never will, unless he is the one to introduce me to her. While extremely touched by her sad life story, the entirety of which is not mine to tell (her mother told mine, who then told me), I genuinely believed he was the right guy for her, and had no intention of ruining that for him, so I gave him my support. He was too rash however, and she rejected him. Then he started spreading horrible rumors about her being a golddigger and a dirty slut. None of which are true, the girl was a virgin and I am pretty sure she never kissed anyone either, if her mother is to be believed. Eventually, she was forced to move back with her father, who proceeded to abuse her in place of her mother, to escape from the rumors and various unsavory characters. I immediately stopped talking o my friend I tried to counteract the rumors, but it was too late. A young woman's life was ruined, simply because I was too loyal to a friend, and ignored her mother when she asked me to help her daughter after she god harrassed by some acquaintances of mine (i couldn't without breaking my promise to him,which I considered sacred at the time). She acquired all kinds of psychological trauma both from her father and the peer group, and I feel at fault. I've never dated anyone since, nor I think I ever will, as each time I think about a girl it brings back the memory how I abandoned the one I was asked to protect, and worse, if given a choice, I might even do it again. Instead, I offer advice, psychological and other support to those in need, helping them recover enough to find someone who will actually be by their side both in sickness and in health, someone, who will not make my mistake of making such a promise, that it prevented him from helping an abused young woman without breaking it. Do not be like I was, blinded by pride. Do what is right, not what sees the most convenient option at the time.", "subreddit": "rapecounseling"}

The relationship is long distance but it started out that way, so its been easier to cope with. We've taken vacations to see eachother, and basically taken every chance we could to see eachother. Its gotten pretty serious and we have discussed moving in together after she graduates. And we both have expressed that we love one another. But i dont know if i do actually love her.\n\nThis all started last time i was with her on her back porch. We were having a discussion and got onto the topic of ethics. Her dad is a serious right wing fox loving radical, (she claims hes not racist but he calls black people \"chocolate milk\" soo.) And unfortunetly thats where she gets all of her information from. She also lives in small town bibleville. As for me, i am a secular humanist. I have very high moral views, and believe everyone deserves love. I was telling her why i viewed this way, and she got super frusturated with me. She then started talking about how she wouldnt mind if (person x) died. It appauld me, and i tried to explain to her why. I told her that the hatred is the reason why we have such intolerance, and the normalization of hatred can really do harm. She told me that she didnt care, she doesnt mind only getting information from propoganda and she wants to stay the way she is.\n\nWe also got onto the topic of physical punishments, it went from the death penalty to spanking, we were all over the board. But all across she told me that physical punishments is key to keeping people inline.\n\nNow, thats fine, its not my place to force her to change her world ideology, but its different because this is my partner. I dont know if i could have a relationship with someone i would worry might hit me or my future children. I dont know if i could share a life with some that I fundementally wholeheartedly disagree with. It may not seem like a big deal, but for me it is. My belifes are strong for a reason, and she was getting mad at me for having them, and seemed to want to disagree with me.\n\nWow this is getting rambally lets get down and to the point.\n\nBasically, i really have felt disconnected. To the point where i pretend to fall asleep during our evening phone calls, so i can go watch youtube or something. And i'm really stuggling to even feel as passionately with her as i did before.\n\nNow to the down sides. I dont want to hurt her, I am the very firstperson she has ever said the words \"i love you\" to. And i know she means it. I feel awful for having brought that out and now wanting to break away. It makes me sick thinking about how hurt she would be if i broke up with her. We have a cat that she would probably get rid of after (i would) because its a manifest of me. Her little brother, would be so lost, he loves me too. I dont want to cause all that pain. I dont want to loose what we have gained. I dont know what to do. Seriously. Ive been in the bathroom crying while writing this at work. I want to throw up right now. Any words would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nEdit: one other thing, if i choose to break the relationship, how tf could i do it. We live 8 hours away, should i wait for next time i see her, should i do it over phone?", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

{"post_id": "d07x16", "created_utc": 1567722638, "title": "A Letter To the Other Woman", "author": "husband-is-an-idiot", "self_text": "*Edit: Thank you to all the commenters and all the silver, gold and platinum givers!*\n\nDear Other Woman,\n\nI've started this email and erased it probably ten times. I have rehearsed lines of what I would say to you if I ever confronted you. Would it be rage, contempt, petty bitchiness, or pity that prevailed? My feelings have gone through the roof, and plummeted through the floorboards.\n\nFor months after learning about you by no admission of my husband's but rather my discovery through an email, I would immediately become focused on the idea of *you*. I would torture myself with thoughts and questions. What did you have that I didn't? What did you provide to my husband that I couldn't? What type of woman would be ok to break up a marriage, especially one with an infant involved? Who raised you and what would your family think about your choices? What was your end game? To mesh yourself into our lives and co-parent with us? Are you ready for endless story times and cleaning boogers and wiping poop off bottoms? Figuring out school schedules and shuffling between houses and making lunches? Surely *not* your thing. I would drive to work almost in a haze, wondering if you had told your friends, over vodka sodas and White Claws at the bars, bringing up his photo on your phone and gloating about how he's going to leave his wife for you. Had you even *told* your friends? What would they think of you? What did YOU think of you? You are only 25, so you've barely just finished developing your brain. That's not even a dig, your brain *literally* finishes developing at 25. You poor thing.\n\nI thought about a lot over the next few months. My marriage. My vows. I replayed myself breezing down the aisle, filled with hope and excitement of the life I would be starting with this man. I walked up to him and held on tight to his hands. I remember the ring, the one he placed on my finger and the one I placed on his, and how good it felt to finally belong to someone, letting all our family and friends know it. I remember later on\u2014only months down the line\u2014how I was so proud of my ring and how he barely wore his. I recall thinking how strange it was that he didn't seem to truly like this idea of being married. He would brush it off saying rings weren't his thing. And maybe they weren't, ya know? But it would be something small that bothered me, beginning the pile of tiny worries that built up into a tower of eventual paranoia and fear.\n\nWhen you came into the picture, I admittedly allowed myself to become consumed in who you were. I thought about your body. I compared it endlessly to mine. How it looked on top of my husband's. How you shaved your legs and put on makeup to go see him, picking out your underwear you'd know he'd take off. I wondered about your prowess. Were you any good? Were you kinky or vanilla? Were you shy or loud? I didn't wonder about my husband. I knew his faces. I've seen them for 8 years. I know what he looks like against sheets and in showers. I didn't wonder what his moves were. I didn't wonder what he sounded like when he came. I knew all that. But with you, I wondered. I didn't want to, but I wondered.\n\nI went through many torturous months of trying to co-parent, while you lurked in the shadows of my mind. Was it you he was texting? No, I'd say, trying to convince myself. He told me he was done with you. It had to be true because it needed to be true. I relaxed. I allowed myself to move forward with co-parenting, with not looking out the window wondering if he was hiding something in the car before he came inside. I could finally breathe\u2014or so I thought.\n\nThen reality gave me a strong dose of Wake The Fuck Up. I found out all over again that you existed ... still. That you had in fact never gone away. This added months on to the timeline that I thought had been done. I had to now add 5 more months to the tally of time he's been lying to me. If he was telling me the truth about when he began with you, you two would be coming up on a year together. It crushed me. Did this mean you were no longer a fling? Were you *real? Was this a real thing?* I cried. I was angry this time. Angry that he thought I was so stupid, angry that he was risking his custody with his child, her stability, that he was writing this story and still not realizing how he was the villain. I noticed something though, I was angry but I wasn't sad. I had already mourned the life I thought I had. This was a different pain. This was the pain that all along, he had never evolved as I had thought. He had never valued the things that should have come first, but only himself. And then slowly over a few days time, my senses came back. And I remembered that no, you weren't real. No, my dear, you aren't real at all. A real relationship doesn't sprout within the cracks of a marriage. It isn't shushed and hidden behind closed doors and erased like deleted texts for almost a year (or more). A real relationship doesn't thrive on secrecy and darkness. A real woman with self worth and dignity wouldn't allow herself to succumb to being an option, an escape, a play thing to a married man for so long. She wouldn't accept being hidden. This dose of reality the universe had given me was actually a gift and it has only now dawned on me how priceless it truly is.\n\nIn the following days after discovery #2, I began to think about you again, but in a totally different light than ever before. I began to feel sadness for you, and relief for me. Because you, my dear, you can *have* him. He's all yours. All the lies, the ability for him to ease into a script to protect himself, the inability to process pain and loneliness, his marital problems or even childhood attachment issues, his history with cheating, his criticism of anything that doesn't fit into his box, all of it. **It's all your problem now**. And thank god for that, right? Because you are now with someone who has no issue cheating on his wife and family, on previous ex girlfriends, on the law, on anything he feels he's above. He has no bar, no line he won't cross to fulfill a deep, deep void that lies within himself. He is damaged goods, broken beyond repair with a self-image complex that needs constant servicing. You're just a prop. Perhaps I was just a prop. I don't know. What I *do* know is that my life's work will be dedicated to making sure he doesn't infect his daughter with the same illnesses of inadequacy I can only imagine is at the bottom of all of this, fueling his choices and his actions. So congratulations, you may have him, but buyer beware, he isn't what he seems. Don't look too closely because if you do, you'll see behind that shiny talk, the flowers and romance that you're actually getting a pretty raw deal.\n\nI feel for you because when I was your age, I, too, believed he hung the moon. I thought he was the answer and I looked beyond all the soaring red flags. I buried them in the far corners of my brain, but they would be washed over with oxytocin and soon forgotten. I'd excuse it all away for years and years to come. And I know you will, too. You may already be doing so. I've heard your hesitation. You have a little voice in the back of your head, too, and it's saying \"is this worth the risk?\" I'll tell you right now, it's not. But that's for you to figure out. Hopefully it won't take you as long as it took me.\n\nFast forward to current day: You both have no idea I know. You think you've tricked me, gotten away with something which keeps the flame lit, the risk hot and the sex hotter. I know this. Which is why I will play my cards well. Which is why this is on a throwaway account. Which is why I play nice in the foreground smiling and co-parenting and pretending, but in the background I'm listening and planning and I can't wait to be free. He has told you that I am the one holding up the divorce. That yes, he's still married but he *doesn't wanna be.* I am positive this is how he's spun the narrative and won't it be a surprise and shock to find out he's been the one dragging his feet this whole time and I am the one that will file.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to say one final thing: Thank you. For being the catalyst that allowed me to see who he truly was this whole time. For allowing me to see that he values himself over all else, including you. For continuing to be the side girl, the one waiting in the wings with bated breath hoping maybe one day he'll take you out in the sunlight instead of keeping you behind closed doors. I'm sure you're wondering why it hasn't happened yet, and unfortunately for you, it probably won't. I don't know what it's like to be the other woman. I won't ever know because I know my worth now. But what I do know is that I see you and I recognize you have been swept up by his sweet talk, his persuasion and his lies, just as I was when I was your age. I wish I had me to tell me back then that it all wasn't worth it. But I suppose it's okay because in the end, I got a beautiful daughter and a huge lesson in life. But you? In the end you'll just get more lies, more waiting, more pieces that pile up into towers of paranoia and fear. What you will eventually come to realize is that this isn't something that can be fixed by outside forces simply because it isn't you, or me, or any other woman that can make him whole. It's *him*. It's how he's built and who he is and nothing and no one will ever be enough to change this festering hole in his heart. If he couldn't change his patterns for his own daughter's stability, he certainly won't change his patterns for you. It took this last blow for me to finally realize that. I wasted so many hours wondering who you were when it never really mattered, did it?\n\nOther Woman, I want you to know that I don't hate you. I don't really feel anything for you now and it's an amazing feeling. Maybe you two will work out and I will meet you. Maybe you'll dip and run once he pays the piper that's whistling down the lane, about to knock on his door. Who knows, and honestly, who cares anymore. He has handed me each nail for his own coffin, one by one and I'm coming for him. Except this time instead of bringing a worthless ring down that aisle, I'll be bringing one *hell* of a lawyer.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe Wife.", "subreddit": "survivinginfidelity"}

I felt extremely offended and went to the bathroom to ball my eyes out at how rude and ungrateful it was... nowadays nobody is friendly or even willing to talk to you!

He has great eyes, lots of hair, fab smile, knows how to hold and keep and conversation, checks all my lifestyle boxes - we vibe. Now, things seem promising, I know. \n\nBut then we made out.

I guess I\u2019m disappointed compared to OG AP who shakes me to my core and sets me on fire.\n\nSo I ended up confronting Ap yesterday. Asked him WTF? Turns out he\u2019s overthinking it - stuck in the moral dilemma of how wrong it all is and how he doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for me beating myself up about it. So he\u2019s been pushing me away even though he\u2019s still interested. And I\u2019m honestly just glad it\u2019s not about me! \n\nI\u2019m cool as a cucumber.

Will it eventually implode because he can\u2019t get past it? Will it all eventually dissipate because we are basically fire together? Should I push it? Give him space?

But it is not so. This is more of a confession than anything else. Three years ago, a young woman (17f) at the time, moved from the states to my town. I was (20m) , dealing with a bad breakup. Our mums somehow met,became good friends very quickly. and then her mum asked me if I would  like to meet her daughte, help herr find new friends here and keep her from hanging with a bad crowd. I refused, having felt unsuited for such a task. Her father was extremely abusive, I later found out, though only to the mother, which led to her parents divorcing. Three months later, my best friend, who was also 20, at the time, found her on instagram. They started hanging out, having met over a mutual friend of ours that also knew her. My friend became obsessed with her, asking me not to interfere with her life or thier relationship. I told him that I have never met the girl in person and I never will, unless he is the one to introduce me to her. While extremely touched by her sad life story, the entirety of which is not mine to tell (her mother told mine, who then told me), I genuinely believed he was the right guy for her, and had no intention of ruining that for him, so I gave him my support. He was too rash however, and she rejected him. Then he started spreading horrible rumors about her being a golddigger and a dirty slut. None of which are true, the girl was a virgin and I am pretty sure she never kissed anyone either, if her mother is to be believed. Eventually, she was forced to move back with her father, who proceeded to abuse her in place of her mother, to escape from the rumors and various unsavory characters. I immediately stopped talking o my friend I tried to counteract the rumors, but it was too late. A young woman's life was ruined, simply because I was too loyal to a friend, and ignored her mother when she asked me to help her daughter after she god harrassed by some acquaintances of mine (i couldn't without breaking my promise to him,which I considered sacred at the time). She acquired all kinds of psychological trauma both from her father and the peer group, and I feel at fault. I've never dated anyone since, nor I think I ever will, as each time I think about a girl it brings back the memory how I abandoned the one I was asked to protect, and worse, if given a choice, I might even do it again. Instead, I offer advice, psychological and other support to those in need, helping them recover enough to find someone who will actually be by their side both in sickness and in health, someone, who will not make my mistake of making such a promise, that it prevented him from helping an abused young woman without breaking it.

She doesn\u2019t love me back, at least not the way I love her, but she was still cool to be friends and offered to put some distance between us in my best interest since it would happen anyways when she left for college. She moved into her college about 3 weeks ago and I told her I loved her a little more than a month ago. We\u2019ve hung out since then and neither of us have brought it up, but it hasn\u2019t been awkward or bad really. Honestly, I\u2019m not even sad about it because I just feel relieved that I\u2019m not hiding anything from her anymore. It\u2019s also nice to know how she feels, even though she doesn\u2019t feel the same as me. She\u2019s an amazing person and I really do love her a lot, but I\u2019m glad I can move on now that all our cards are on the table.\n\nThank you guys so much for your advice! :)", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

My boss is a newish business broker (has been practicing for 2 years) and has one other employee, another girl my age. Our workspace is integrated with his father and brother's respective offices. \n\nThe environment is decently casual and people are laid back. However...on my second day (yesterday) I was called into my boss's office. He's a good looking guy who's into fitness and has a treadmill in his closet-like office. He tells me to sit in his work chair. I do. He closes the door to the tiny office and on the back of the door is a picture of a nude pornstar, boobs staring directly at my face. Instantly it made me feel uncomfortable....this is an office setting. He had flashing mood lighting making the room feel like an opium den. He stood on the treadmill and talked to me for an hour about marketing strategies, constantly getting side tracked and talking about random things in his life.\n\n I just could not get comfortable in there. It also weirds me out that every single employee he has ever hired (according to the other girl that works for him) has been a pretty young woman fresh out of college. I'm not saying this is wrong it just....idk. \n\nAfter our meeting, wherein nothing \"wrong\" actually occured, he told me not to tell the other girl that I work with (who wasn't there that day) that we had a long meeting. I asked him why and he said \"because she will make fun of me.\" I was like ummm ok and he let me leave the office. When I got back out there I noticed that I was sweaty as fuck and kind of shaky. The older people who work in the office (his dad's employees etc) kept staring at me too. I don't know why but it just all felt so surreal to me. \n\nHe seems like a nice guy, and he works in an office with his immediate family....not a lot of \"space\" to be a creep (not saying he is). I just get a weird vibe from him, and I felt it during my interview too. However I can't place exactly what makes me feel uncomfortable. \n\nI know this isn't really a question but I'm just...confused? I want to hear from others who have had more experience in the workplace/with weird gut feelings/etc. \n\nbonus: I browsed some of his recent online job listings and saw that he was requesting headshots for a marketing position (same position I applied for, but that wasn't requires on the site I applied through). That seems fishy to me but again....nothing solid.\n\nedit: this obviously isn't a long term job, but they are paying me surprisingly well and I want to try to hold onto this until I can get my foot in another door.

I ask him to write it down at his convenience - what he would like for me to do differently or what he\u2019s going to try with regard to himself or whatever. It never happens. \nWe get nowhere. But then he doesn\u2019t like it when I get loud and mad and says he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me because I\u2019m yelling. \nWe\u2019ve been to a few counseling sessions, basically when the counselor started to expect him to give direct answers (and not deflect or change the subject) he said we were ganging up on him and not letting him answer.\nI\u2019m at a loss. We\u2019ve been sleeping separately for almost a year. As of now we\u2019re only staying together because we own a home and have 2 kids and trying to afford separate residences and also not disrupt the kids and their lifestyles, etc is basically impossible.\nWe also have 2 large dogs that we all adore and moving to an apartment would make us have to give them up. \nHelp!\nEdit* He also in the last year has developed a very time consuming phone game habit that basically has his face in his phone at every free moment when he\u2019s not at work.", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

We do always have to be talking about heavy topics, every now and the we can talk about much littler subjects but i would like to keep a focus on the more thought out conversation.

Excuse the rambling, I don\u2019t know what response I\u2019m looking for, I just feel like I\u2019ve hit a wall.\n\nI\u2019ve come to London for 4 days with my mum for a break, my dad walked out on us suddenly last July and now every couple of weeks he\u2019s chasing her up to make the next decision, we needed a breather. It\u2019s just me and her at home, I\u2019ve been looking for work since May. Had a couple of volunteering roles but nothing concrete.\n\nWe got here by coach yesterday, 6 hours on the coach, and we got some cheap theatre tickets through an app and went last night. Then today we went to see a TV recording in the morning and got some more cheap theatre tickets for the evening. We\u2019ve kind of front loaded the trip! We\u2019ve crammed in a lot. Through all three shows, I felt like I was having an out of body experience. I just couldn\u2019t really engage with them, I was always thinking about how bad things have been the last year and why aren\u2019t I enjoying this.\n\nI just feel broken. Like I know, coming to London isn\u2019t going to fix my problems, but why can\u2019t I switch off just for a couple of hours? Maybe I\u2019m tired from all the travelling, I\u2019m still adjusting to it, I dunno. We\u2019ve been to three things and I feel like I was just going through the motions and not really taking them in. \n\nWe\u2019ve been walking around London through parks and Chinatown and all that, I feel like I\u2019ve been on edge all day. Maybe I\u2019m so eager to enjoy everything that I\u2019m trying too hard and not? I dunno, I\u2019m not really. I feel like all my enthusiasm and energy has been sucked out of me over the last year! I\u2019m in London and it\u2019s all great but why do I only feel relaxed when I\u2019m back in the hotel and my mum\u2019s zonked out? \n\nI\u2019m starting to resent my mum a bit cos she\u2019s kind of a reminder of the divorce, I dunno, she\u2019s like damaged goods. That sounds bad. But there\u2019s this cloud hanging over us and she\u2019s more susceptible to it, understandably. She seems to be enjoying the things we\u2019re doing, but she\u2019ll get panicky at first when we\u2019re planning out the day because she\u2019s not sure of where we\u2019re going\u2026 She is always saying we\u2019re doing too much etc but it doesn\u2019t feel like much to me, and then we end up doing it and she enjoys it, but I have to fight through that before we get to that point. I feel like when she\u2019s upset, I\u2019m trying to support and comfort her, and then later she\u2019s alright and all my energy\u2019s gone by that point. Planning a route isn\u2019t as bad as trying to convince her there\u2019s things worth living for like I\u2019ve had to in the last year, but it takes similar effort and the former feels like an extension of the latter.\n\nI feel like I need to detach myself from the situation before I get worse. Or maybe things will get better once the divorce goes through and I haven\u2019t got it on my mind all the time?\n\nBut I also feel like this feeling has been there for years, at least since when I started university 7 years ago. I think I kind of knew how my dad was feeling for a while and was cold to him because of how he was with my mum. There\u2019s been this feeling of unrest for a while.\n\nWe\u2019re going to take it easier for the remaining 3 days. I didn\u2019t plan anything else cos I want to just chill out and mooch around. But we did plan to go to the 3 shows and I feel like I squandered them by not being in the right frame of mind. I did enjoy them and I was engaged at times, but they also felt like ordeals I had to get through. Maybe I\u2019d just built the hype up too much in my head, but I don\u2019t think so.

My gf of about a year comes from an extremely wealthy family and good family and is studying to be a doctor! When we first started dating she told me she liked how we both were from the same religion and we did activities. That\u2019s how I met my current gf .\n\nAnyway I met my friend Aaron at college and we hit it off right away! He helped me financially and helped me get over my bad breakup. After my lease was up with my roommates who my current gf likes I decided to move in with Aaron and his best friend joe.\n\nJoe is extremely trashy in my gf eyes because one he has necktats, high school dropout, is 35 and works at Burger King, and is abusive towards my gf and had threatened and hit her. He also threw her dog and broke his leg . So I can understand why she hates him.\n\nMy other friend Aaron isn\u2019t bad at all maybe just isn\u2019t motivated and is 30 without a degree yet. Aaron has helped me a lot\n\nMy lease is coming to an end with joe and Aaron and I decided to move in with my gf\n\nJoe moved out of state and both my gf and i are glad but The reason why I\u2019m writing this is because my gf and I just moved in together and i just found out that Aaron had a prior eviction and owes $6000 to a previous landlord and because of this doesn\u2019t qualify for his own place. He has asked me if he could stay with my gf and I for a couple months and my gf is upset!\n\nShe is upset because she feels it isn\u2019t our responsibility to help my friend Aaron because it\u2019s his fault he got evicted and she doesn\u2019t want someone who she thinks is a liability living with us.\n\nAaron is a nice guy and has helped me a lot but i can see why my gf thinks he is a loser. She told me it\u2019s because 1. He is 30 without a real job 2. Brags about getting c\u2019s and d\u2019s in classes 3. Hangs out and is associated with trashy people his friend joe and he also had a friend stay with us at our apartment for 5 months who ended up doing crack in the bathroom 4. Has two kids he can barley pay child support to 5. Spends all his free time watching anime and movies and playing video games 6. And has 6 cats\n\nBut I feel obligated to help him because he helped my financially but my gf says if he moves in she\u2019ll move out she feels me associating with people like that lowers my potential. She also said that by me hanging out with him and people like him will make me a loser by association and will ruin my reputation. She also doesn't feel safe with the idea of him living with us because of the fact he is friends with scary people.\n\nI am deeply in love with my gf and the only time we Have ever fought is now about my friend having nowhere to go because of his eviction but I also care about my friend.\n\nMy parents And other friends agree with my gf that they think Aaron is trashy but he is still my friend She told me she doesn't really care if I\u2019m still friends with with him but she Just thinks I shouldn\u2019t enable him by letting him live with us.\n\nI don\u2019t want to drop and abandon my friend but I can see why my gf wants nothing to do with him and it\u2019s killing me!\n\nIs she wrong for not wanting him to live with us? What should I do? Thanks\n\nEven my parents don\u2019t like my roommates or my other friends Don\u2019t like them either!\n\nShe never told me I can\u2019t be friends with him just that he can\u2019t move in with us!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHELP\n\n0 upvotes\u20223 comments", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

We met in high school and had been dating until college then broke up for a year due to various reasons on her part then got back together after a year. Now she (22) and I (22) are both living together and have been for about 3 months. We\u2019ve also been talking about getting married. \n\nI came out as bi 4 years ago and told her once we got back together. She was totally cool with it and we had been happy since. Ever since then, I was confident in my sexuality until a little while ago. I keep having this back-to-back conversation in my head about my identity and I have come to realize that I\u2019m gay. \n\nShe has a history of anxiety, depression, has attempted suicide, been abused, the whole deal. I keep telling myself that I need to tell her the truth but I don\u2019t want to add on to the mental strain she already has. To make matters worse, we have a trip with her family coming up next week and a trip to Disney world next month with my family (a lot of our money went into that trip). I don\u2019t want to break up with her before all of this happens and make things awkward, but I don\u2019t want to keep lying to her until after the trip. I just don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI really do care for her and I don\u2019t want to lose her as a friend, but I can\u2019t keep this relationship going and lie to her for the rest of my life.\n\nUpdate: I came out to her last night. She was understanding about my struggles, but she was mad I had waited until we had moved in and started renting a house because now she doesn\u2019t know if she\u2019ll be able to afford living there by herself and my name is also on the lease. I\u2019m happy things didn\u2019t turn out any worse than it did but I feel so sick from all of this mess. I hope things turn out better as time goes on, but right now I feel like throwing up every second knowing I crushed her dreams as well as having to give up the relationship I had.

In chapter 31 titled: The Four Steps, Plus One, Dr. Mat\u00e9 outlines a method for healing addiction based off a program at the UCLA School of Medicine for the treatment of OCD, formally called the Four-Step Self-Treatment Method.  \n\nThe five steps should be practiced daily at least once, but also whenever the urge to smoke is so strong that you are tempted to act on it. Find a place to write\u2014preferably somewhere quiet.  \n\nTake whatever resonates with you and leave whatever doesn't serve you.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**THE FOUR STEPS PLUS ONE**  \n**1.  Re-label**  \nLabel the addictive thought or urge exactly for what it is, an obsessive thought.\n\nEXAMPLE: \u201cI don\u2019t need to smoke now; I\u2019m only having an obsessive\nthought that I have such a need. It\u2019s not a real, objective need but a\nfalse belief. I may have a feeling of urgency, but there is actually\nnothing urgent going on.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**2. Re-attribute**  \nState very clearly where that urge originated: in neurological circuits that were programmed into your brain long ago. Instead of blaming yourself for having addictive thoughts or desires, you calmly ask why these desires have exercised such a powerful hold over you.\n\nEXAMPLE: \u201cBecause they are deeply ingrained in my brain\nand because they are easily triggered whenever I\u2019m stressed or\nfatigued or unhappy or bored.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**3. Re-focus**  \nBuy yourself time because the urge is temporary. Rather than smoke, find something else to do. Choose something that you enjoy and that will keep you active: preferably something healthy and creative, but anything that won't cause greater harm. Start with a small goal, maybe it's just five minutes. When you accomplish your goal, record it in a journal as a success.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**4.  Re-value**  \nRemind yourself all the problems smoking weed has caused you. Ask yourself, \"What has weed done for me?\"\n\nEXAMPLES:  \n\u2022 \"Weed has caused me to spend money needlessly or to stuff myself when I wasn\u2019t hungry or to be absent from the ones I love or to expend my energies on activities I later regretted.\"  \n\u2022 \"Weed has wasted my time.\"  \n\u2022 \"Weed has led me to lie and to cheat and to pretend\u2014first to myself and then to everyone close to me.\"  \n\u2022 \"Weed has left me feeling ashamed and isolated.\"  \n\u2022 \"Weed promised joy and delivered bitterness.\"  \n\u2022 \"Weed has caused me to betray my true values and disregard my true goals.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**5. Re-create**  \nChoose a different life. Write down your values and intentions. Envision yourself living with integrity, creativity, and presence. What is the life you really want? What do you choose to create?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI found the entire book for free by searching In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts chapter 31.\n\n\"In choosing sobriety we\u2019re not so much avoiding something harmful\nas envisioning ourselves living the life we value.\"", "subreddit": "leaves"}

I (19M) am worried, but want to keep our relationship.", "author": "OpenRelationship1231", "self_text": "Some background: \n\nMy (19M) girlfriend (18F) have been together for a little over 3 months. We met during the second semester of our senior year of high school (just graduated). Originally we were just FWB but fell hard for each other and we are both very deeply in love now. One of the amazing aspects of our relationship was our sex life. To spare everyone the details we just clicked in a way neither of us had ever clicked with anyone before. Both of us have articulated this and I know its true from her. We both want a future together, despite knowing the odds of highschool romances lasting. The next time we are going to be together physically will be in January.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe issue: \n\nIt has now been roughly two weeks (I know, not a lot of time) since we've been together in person and both of us are craving sex and have talked about this with each other plenty. Both of us have a very high libido and since we can't be with each other, we are often left frustrated sexually. Today she brought up that she had a dream last night where she was with someone else and I was okay with it and she really enjoyed it. We talked about her dream and came to the conclusion that an open relationship is what she wants. She explained to me that she is still extremely in love with me and she believes that I am her soul mate (I believe the same) but she misses the act of sex. She says that she only wants someone to be with physically and she will always be mine emotionally. What I am scared/anxious about is that since I can't be there for her physically and I can't comfort her physically (not just sex), she will find someone else to replace me. It's hard for me to explain because I know it sounds like the opposite, but it isn't that I don't trust her, it's more that I don't know what could happen. Based on others' stories it often feels like an \"open relationship\" is the beginning of the end of the relationship and I really really don't want that. In my opinion, the flip side of this is that I deny her the open relationship and deny her sex for four months. I feel that this would only drive us apart. It feels like this is my only option to continue with the relationship (I really don't want to lose her) and I suppose I'm scared of this change as I don't know what it entails. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRequest: \n\nWhile I have read the stories that open relationships were the beginning of the end, I've also read some that say it saved their relationship/marriage. I trust her that she is mine emotionally and the same goes the other way. I don't consider breaking up with her to be an option. I have accepted that we are going to try an open relationship, I just need some help coming to terms with it and understanding what I'm doing here. I would love stories about how being open saved relationships and any personal anecdotes or advice. I understand that what we are doing is going to be difficult, but I'm willing to at least try it for the sake of our love.", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

I forgive him as i get feelings dont just switch off and he probably still sid miss her but this didnt mean he wanted to get back with her. \n\n\n5 months in : i find him on tinder, as i snooped. Heart sank. He lied &amp; said he hadnt been on it since we met. He really got drunk at christmas on a night out and said he sent some messages with no intention of meeting them. \n\n7 months in : we went away on separate weekends away 4 monthe in. At this point i found out he cheated with 2 girl 'friends' he met uo with during his trip. First one stays with him on the friday night. He sleeps with her (taking her virginity). Second one stays on saturday night he sleeps with her (they had often kissed everytimethey saw eachother at music things, friends for years, he fancied her). Comes home, sleeps with me. I find out 3 months later when i noticed 1 girl was not on his friends list. He admitted kissing her. I contact her &amp; get the truth. I asked him why he keeps doing this. He discloses sexual abuse &amp; agrees to go for counselling. He said he has a problem with sexual risk taking linked to abuse and wants to change. Says no other partner has known he has had such a problem re sex/cheating and although i caught him out im the first one who he has wanted to change for. I stay with him. \n\nDid the counselling. Very open &amp; honest te phones &amp; passwords. Send me screenshots of every message from a girl. Girl whom he slept with wanted him to see her he apolgised to her said he regretted his behaviour had hurt us was selfish was doing a lot or work on himself to change/ fix it.\n\n2 years in - saw message on his phone which he deleted (technical glitch, i dunno why i could see it but i was meant to see it) to woman twice his age \"my gf wouldnt be too happy and neither would your boyfriend \ud83d\ude05 but text me if u want to chat\"\n\nThat was 4 week ago. Screamed cried told him to pack his stuff. Couldnt stick it, told him to come over, i needed comfort - he instead went out drinking with friends. Has since apologised. Said he'd do whatever to make up for it. Has re referred to counselling. Is on the waiting list. I cant go to work. Im crying nearly every day. I cant handle losing him. I imagined forever together. But what we tried to build trust over the last year and a half hasnt stopped him returning to old habits. I cant forget about it. I caught him out again so how can i relax when he is out drinking or with his friends. Yet i love him. I love his company. Hes a perfect match for me emotionally intellectually physically, but im tired of the worry. He is inconsistent in terms of whether he supports me or lets me down. I dont know if its repairable. Any advice? At the minute im trying to limit how much we see each other to get used to not having him here everyday. Part of me thinks it was just a text atleast he hasnt physically cheated but then i think this last year and a half has all been for nothing cos he has done it again.\n\nSorry for the long post &amp; thanks for reading", "subreddit": "survivinginfidelity"}

Even though he doesn't name me it makes my entire body feel like it's on fire with cringe when he says stuff about me. if you're curious it's mostly about how i'm so \"past my prime\" (he goes into a lot of detail about that) and incapable of love. he also does a lot of deep hinting that i'm an unfaithful partner and/or obsessed with rich men.\n\nand just for background by the way...i've never cheated. i've never considered cheating. we broke up because he was god awful at sex, to be fucking honest. selfish and boring and he's always unwilling to do anything. i felt so deeply lonely and neglected emotionally and physically from it that it felt like we were living as roommates more than partners. when i felt like shit about our relationship i ended it. i didn't wallow in self pity about aging out of my teenage body and craving older richer men. i broke up with his doofy ass and moved on like an adult. the split was respectful and somewhat amicable. he understood why i wanted out. if he were a great catch i could have lived without good sex, but he's deeply stupid and painfully boring (although apparently his audience of dweebs would disagree with me because they seem to love him) and passionless as a turd. This fucking idiot still cries when he talks to me and begs me to give him another chance. yet he's going online and spewing this shit the whole time, making it sound like our split was because i was a cheater who was insecure about \"losing my looks\" and looking for a rich dude.\n\ni feel like i don't even know him. i feel like he's an actual psychopath to be able to hide his character like this...i don't know what the hell i should even do. so far i've told one person in my life and he thinks i should blast him and tell everyone and embrace the cringe and laugh at it. but i don't see the humor in it. and i don't feel like i can do it, i mean beyond the anger i'm also feeliing so heartbroken for his sorry worthless ass. i spent a lot of my life with him. i've carried a lot of love for him even though i don't like him as a partner. it is devastating to see that he is in this pathetic of a head space. i don't want to embarrass him. this whole thing is just so fucked up and feels so surreal. how could i spend so much of my life with someone and not know him at all. i still have to interact with this idiot from time to time. i almost feel like he WANTED me to find it so that he could grab my attention. it fucking did the trick if that was it.\n\nanyway i'm sorry this is so long, there's a lot more to it  but idk. what the actual fuck do i do. should i ignore this whole thing? if so is there anywhere someone can direct me to go to talk to other people about this? because i need to vent. or should i confront him and ask him to get a new hobby and get rid of his platform? and if you think that i should confront him how should i do it? should i email him/call him/text him/meet in person? and waht should i even say....just any advice at all would be fucking wonderful. i know it's a long shot but if there are any other women who have gone through something similar i would love your advice in particular.\n\ntl;dr : my ex is a red piller/ men-go-their-own-way goofball with a social media platform and it's painfully embarrassing to think that people in our real life will see it so i don't know if i should confront him about it, ignore it, or set myself on fire and jump off a cliff", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}

I'm not super obsessed with him or anything, but I've never tried to pursue a crush in my life and it's been so frustrating. I talk to him in the one class we have together, and I asked for his snap last week. So far we've only texted a little bit, and I've tried complimenting him and asking about where he lived before moving here (irl), to which I got good responses. \n\nThe thing is, this guy is not very talkative. He talks to me, and we've had nice convos, but he doesn't seem as relaxed. He talks to guys more easily than he talks to me, which I guess is understandable, but it makes it just that much harder to read him. He doesn't really make eye contact when we talk either, which according to YouTube could either be a great or not so great sign (translation: idk wtf it means)\n\nI also have a lot of trouble with my own self confidence. I've always been kind of bitch-faced and nihilistic, and many people have told me I look intimidating, but pretty??? I never wanted to be in clubs and overall didn't really like people. However this year, I'm trying so hard to have a better mind set, and it's been going great. I'm in a sport, I made some new friends, I had the courage to talk to this guy etc.\n\nAnyways, homecoming is coming up in a WEEK and I initially had a plan to get to know him before I asked him to go with me, but I don't think we know each other that well. I'm falling back into my \"I hate everything\" mindset and my confidence, as well as patience, is dwindling. I honestly don't know if I should ask him or not. \n\nIf anyone can, please help meee", "subreddit": "relationship_advice"}
