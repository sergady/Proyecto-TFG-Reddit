The thing is while it reminds me of the acid reflux sound I'm not having issues with acid reflux.  Also similarly I'm hearing it internally if that makes any sense, like how if you swish saliva around your mouth you hear it sort of from inside rather than the noise outside your cheeks through your ears.\n\nI have had moment's where I feel off balance as well. I used to have panic attacks when I was drinking still. My anxiety has been quite low to non existant since getting sober, and I haven't had a panic attack well over a year.

For the past month I have noticed a lot of concerning symptoms arise and I've been to the doctor for a few of them and got no where. It all started with REALLY bad bruising on all of my extremities. Arms, legs, knees, thighs, etc. I normally would not be concerned because I do bruise easily but I woke up one morning to discover many bruises and one LARGE one on my knee that looks like it would be from a fall or accident and I literally did nothing the day before to cause any of the bruising on my body. I went to my primary doctor for a physical and mentioned the bruising. She was very concerned and ordered lab work to check my blood for any spikes or falls in any of my blood counts and everything was in normal range. She decided to chalk it up to the extreme heat we're experiencing here in Las Vegas, NV and said if it persists to come back. Now I'm no doctor but really? The heat where I was born and raised, and that my body would be use to? \n\nSoon after that I got a UTI and yeast infection which I have never had. I went on antibiotics and everything was back to normal after a week. A few days after that I woke up in the middle of the night because my left tonsil was EXTREMELY swollen to the point where I thought my throat was closing (it wasn't). I had some steroids (prednisone) on hand and  I could not afford to get sick with classes starting up for me so I started to to take them to bring the inflammation down. The tonsil slowly started going down after a few days of taking the steroids. Eventually I finished the medication but 2 days after completing the course of steroids it swelled up again and this time my entire throat was red and felt like knives and I had excruciating body aches like when you have a fever. I checked and my thermometer said I did not have a fever but hours later after taking Advil I began having sweats like I was breaking a fever.  The body aches persisted for two days with a swollen tonsil. Eventually, it all stopped and went down. On the couple days in between of me feeling better I then got pins and needle like sensations of the palms of my hands for two days and they went away. Then yesterday I woke up with my right tonsil now slightly swollen and my left one is back to normal. While on top of this all I have felt extra fatigued but I've always thought it was maybe the fact I'm just busy and always on the go. I do not smoke, I drink on social occasions, and live a fairly active/healthy lifestyle. I workout a few times a week and eat a balanced diet. \n\nNormally I would not be concerned but this has all been happening in just a span of one month and I just want to feel well and healthy again. I'm tired of being tired, runned down and experiencing something like a sore throat or UTI and yeast infection or tingling hands right after the other. My main concern is do any of you think each of these symptoms are just single individual problems or is there a bigger picture and are related? If so what do you think it could be? I plan on seeing my primary doctor again but I feel she may not connect the dots if they need to be connected. Also I want to see the many options you come up with because I've gone in to see a doctor and have been told because they cant figure out what is wrong that it must be in my head, especially since I'm young.

I have what I can only describe as \"flares\" where, for weeks at a time I have urgent loose stools, usually occurring within 20 minutes of eating, up to 10+ times/day.  I have to stress that it does not matter the type of food I eat when this occurs.  During these flares, I have right-sided abdominal pain, mostly under my ribs but sometimes right above my hip and medially as close to an inch from my bellybutton.\n\nTwo years ago I sought help when I wasn't able to keep food in my system for over a month and I lost over 40 pounds. The mds were concerned about Crohns due to family history (father). I had upper/lower endoscopy, bloodwork and stool testing that showed only minor gastritis and a polyp (removed) in the small intestine.  However, since GI appointments are so damn hard to come by, my issues had all but resolved the week before so I wonder if they would have seen differently if I was actively \"flaring\".  \n\nA year later, I ended up having my gallbladder removed and the surgeon (who was doubtful g-unit was the issue but still removed since I had stones/sludge) also did a liver biopsy.  This showed mild fatty liver disease.  Diet/exercise and careful watch was prescribed.  I complained to my PCP about the still ongoing diarrhea issue and was shooed away, being told it was from the surgery.  I understand the post-surgery diarrhea a bunch of people exhibit but my OG symptoms never went away so I'm doubtful, especially since I'm so far out from surgery with same old problems at this point, that was the case.\n\nI guess I'll throw in some abnormal lab values while I'm taking the time to write this.  Increased ALP within past 3 months and lifetime sky-high values for CRP and IgA.  I've been given no reason for the elevation in these values.  Also, diabetic and asthmatic if that's relevant.\n\nPresent day, I still experience these digestive flares.

Sometimes pain medice can make it stronger.  \nIn 15 years, I only had a couple hours without the pain, it was the first time I tried Quetiapine before sleep.  \nThat day I woked up like I just removed a ton of weight of my head, but the pain returned a couple of hours after...  \nUnfortunatelly the medicine didn't worked after that...  \n(It wasn't mine, so I couldn't keep taking it and I guess it only would work again in higher doses)  \n\n\nIt's getting stronger as time goes by...

(they said I jumped of the ground and started convulse...)  \nWoke up in the hospital, I think they did an head exam with a Contrast agent.  \nI remember the doctor saying that he did saw 3 dots in my brain, the doctor said it looked like calcification spots, that he thought could become benign tumors...  \nI lost that exam papers, never did another exam that could visualize this, only without a Contrast agent... (I don't know, I'm kinda of scared of needles and invasive exams... D: )  \n\n\nRecently I discovered that my great grandmother died by an unknown disease before I was born, she apparently went crazy, they said that religion did that to her, since she seemed to become fanatic before dying, she was released from the asylum before dying, without a diagnosis, so she may have died by the mysterious disease.  \n\n\nThis got me thinking it could be Fahr's Disease, since it's really rare in young people, and it's genetic.  \nThe dots that was in my brain in that old exam may be what causes all the other symptoms as it grows.  \nIf it was arteriovenous malformation, that could've been a bleed in my brain, that triggered the seizure, that would explain why the other exams didn't showed anything (without Contrast agent)  \n\n\n  \nI also have Migraine with aura sometimes, but I think it has something to do with my diet or something...  \nThe pain of the migraine can combine with the disease head pain. So it couldn't be \"just a migraine\" like some (bad) doctors said...  \nThey blamed me with things like \"you should use eye glasses, you should keep away from a computer\"  \nThese suggestions never did nothing.  \n\n\n  \nOther thing that could be a symptom, I notice that my body \"wants\" carbohydrates all the time.  \nDon't know if it has something to do...  \nI also struggle to gain weight, my metabolism seem to adapt, when I eat a lot it speed up, when I eat less it slowdown, so I stay pretty stable at 65kg (my max is 70kg, but require exercise, lots of food and protein supplements, my height is 1,79m)  \n\n\n  \nI really want to find out what it is and treat it, I feeling worse day after day...  \nFor information: I'm a white male, I live in Brazil but part of my family come from Portugal (before I was born), I also have a Heart murmur, I do not take any meds right now.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

(TL:DR at the bottom.)\n\nIn November 2017 I came down with the longest-lasting case of the flu I've ever had. It lasted about 6 weeks. I missed over a week of work, and recovery was excruciatingly slow. During and after that 6 weeks I had around 5 ear infections and was put on antibiotics 3 times. In March of 2018 I went to my family doctor for what I thought was yet another ear infection. I felt the pressure and pain I had come to recognize as an ear infection. To my surprise, he told me my ears were fine. A catscan of my sinuses also showed no issues, so the doctor referred me to an ENT.\n\nI had a hearing test and was told that I had some mild hearing loss for my age--they explained there was hearing loss that could occur because of normal use/aging, and loss due to other damage, and their test indicated some of both. Thought that was interesting, but when I saw the ENT, he told me there was nothing wrong with my ears. He said what I'm experiencing could either be TMJ or allergies.\n\nI am now treating both TMJ and allergies. I have a night guard for my teeth that I use most nights, which I started late last year (on a related note, I read somewhere that TMJ is caused by sleep apnea. Not sure if it's true, but I have mild apnea and use a CPAP machine nightly). For the allergies, I am taking drops and have been on them for about 11 weeks.\n\nI still feel like my sinuses are swollen all the time. I have occasional ear pain. I know something's wrong because I've always loved swimming, especially diving and going deep, and when I go more than a few feet under water now, my ears hurt badly.\n\nI am treating TMJ and allergies in order to do my \"due dilligence\" but I have seen no alleviation of symptoms since starting any of these treatments. I have always felt like neither of these were the cause of my symptoms but I don't know what else could be going on here. I would be very grateful to anyone with any insight or experience who can share. Thanks!\n\nTL:DR - Got the flu 2 years ago, 5 ear infections, now my ears and sinuses feel off and sometimes painful, no relief by treating TMJ or allergies.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

After multiple miscarriages she decided to do some tests of her hormonal levels and found out that they are a bit of. To compensate for this she decided to try a sort of skin creme with added bio identical progesterone. She has been using this creme for about five weeks now and two weeks ago we found out that we are finally pregnant again.\n\nAlthough about a week ago we noticed that she had developed a sort of rash on her arms. At first we thought it was only an allergic reaction to some cray fish and shrimp that we had eaten and which we are not used to eat that often. But when three days had passed and the rash and irritation had not gone down what so ever but had actually increased to more parts of the body we started to suspect it might be something else. The best way to describe the rash that it all began with is that is looks like [urticaria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hives). We contacted our doctor and they suggested we try applying cortisone creme to the rash for it to go down as well as eating antihistamine. This has had no effect what so ever.\n\nToday, nine days after the initial signs, the rashes have spread to as good as the entire dront side of her body, from the throat to the thighs. On the arms where it all started the rashes has gone to full cover hives with liquid filled blisters. The arms and right hand are swollen beyond recognition. We have quit with the progesterone creme and have been prescribed another type of progesterone medication,three days ago, but the conditions are still only getting worse. The doctors say they don't know what the cause is but they have submitted a request that we will be sent to a dermatologist. Unfortunately the waiting times for the dermatologist could be to long.\n\nIt doesn't seem to be contagious though since i have had no signs of any irritation on my skin.\n\n[Here are some images of the condition.](https://imgur.com/gallery/w5vZx6N)\n\n\nWe are getting desperate and we are so worried that anything we do to fix this will harm the fetus.

Appeared to get better at first, and about 2 months later started getting worse. \n\n**Previous discussion with doctors:**  \nI spoke to a doctor over the phone about 4 months after the injury, who ordered an x-ray which ruled out arthritis. About a month later I was able to speak to a nurse practitioner.  **I did not communicate my symptoms well,** and she jumped directly to ordering a nerve test based on the numbness and rushed me out the door. (Neurologists in my area are booked up for months, so now I'm in limbo).  \n**Current symptoms:**  \nI am unable to bend the metacarpophalangeal joint of my thumb, and may have issues in the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb.  If I immobilize the metacarpal bone of the thumb, I can only bend the right MCP joint about 40-50 degrees before I experience discomfort, while the corresponding left joint easily passes 90 degrees.  I can force the right MCP joint to bend farther, but experience pain in the joint and hear a crunching noise within the MCP.  \nI can not extend the tip of my right thumb to the base of my right pinky without pain. (While left thumb can do this easily).  \nI have occasional numbness in a subset of the area served by the sensory branch of the radial nerve, which I believe passes through the anatomical snuff box adjacent to the carpometacarpal joint.  (This joint was also affected by the injury 6 months ago, also appeared to get better).  \nMy right MCP always appears 'flatter' than my left MCP, if I try to hold symmetric positions.  I'm not 100% sure this is not an optical illusion due to slight edema, but it appears that the heads of the bones are usually in slightly different positions, and the right joint always prefers to be straighter than the left. It looks 'collapsed'. My apologies if this is a spurious, irrelevant 'symptom'. \n\nThe soft tissue near the MCP, between MCP &amp; CMC, and within the nearby webbing are usually sensitive to the touch. This is especially true for some locations where I think muscles/tendons attach to bone? (Left thumb is not sensitive)  \nThe above symptoms  have been consistent for several months, persisting even after I started (two weeks ago)  wearing a brace, and icing frequently.   \n**Previous symptoms:**  \nPrevious to restricting activity &amp; icing frequently, I would try to use my right hand to perform light manual labor, and would experience pain, inability to move the thumb from a neutral position without escalating pain, apparent loss of grip strength in the thumb (or maybe that is psychosomatic, as my mind rebels from the pain?), throbbing pain even while resting in a neutral position.    \n\n\nI have also previously experienced burning, itchiness, numbness, and tingling in two small regions very near the MCP joint, both contained within the region served by the sensory branch of the radial nerve, labelled \"dorsal digital\" in [this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorsal_digital_nerves_of_radial_nerve#/media/File:Gray812and814.PNG)  \nPersonally I think my nerve issues are a secondary effect of another, unidentified problem, but in the interest of thoroughness: I do not have any obvious (to me) issues with my motor nerves. I've done some generic, crude self tests for this, will be happy to do any you recommend to me.  (I do not believe I have \"Wartenberg syndrome\" as my itching, numbness, burning, etc was all distal to the anatomical snuff box.)  \n\n\n**Questions?**  \nYou folks know more than me, and I would love to hear your ideas, suggestions, or questions you have for me. I have a few questions I'm hoping some of you may help me with, but if you already have something to share with me, please just skip the rest. :)   \n\n\n1) Can nerve impingement, nerve crush, or nerve damage cause the crunching sound &amp; lack of movement in my MCP joint? I really want to know this, because I want to know if I have two separate problems, or if one set of problems is causing the other set. (And does A cause B, or B cause A?)\n\n2) Can damage to my joints or adjacent tissue cause the neurological symptoms? What kind of damage? Are there tests I can do to myself to narrow this down?\n\n3) Is it important to get this nerve test, even though the NP who ordered it was unaware of joint pain symptoms and appeared to me to be grasping at straws? (She even thought it was the medial nerve, not the radial nerve).\n\n4) What, in general, can limit my ability to move through a normal range of motion, but also:\n\n   \\- not be noticed by the radiologist\n\n  \\- occur even if I'm able to willfully grit my teeth and force my joint further (ie muscle still works, nerves still driving the muscle)  \n\n\n5) I won't be able to see a doctor for a while.  What should I do until then to reduce harm and/or diagnose myself?\n\nThank you so much for your time!", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I\u2019m in the U.S. I\u2019ve had other issues, but none that I think are relevant.\n\nStarting July 28th, I woke up around 5-6ish in the morning to throw up and then have a lovely bout of diarrhea. We had eaten at my mother in law\u2019s the night before and I remember she had made a comment about \u201choping the burgers were cooked enough, because she wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d \n\nSo, immediately I suspected the burgers. I haven\u2019t done well with red meat since high school, so I figured on top of being undercooked, it was just normal, me-not-being-able-to-eat-red-meat stuff again, and went about my day being sick like I would normally do when I am sick (which is frequently)\n\nNext day, same thing, I wake up between 5-6, puke and diarrhea, again, still figuring that the food from the aforementioned night. I\u2019m also having stupidly bad stomach pains when I am not occupying the bathroom, making it hard to eat. To combat this pain, I have been taking gas-x which helped the immense pain.\n\nThe week continues on like this (with intermittent puking that gradually subsided almost completely) and as it i have been keeping track of what I\u2019ve eaten. My wife and I began to suspect that I\u2019ve magically developed a gluten allergy, so I cut out all the gluten I am aware of, and i start to feel a little better. The stomach cramps are less, I\u2019m not puking, so we figured that was it. During this time, I also discovered that if I got up and ate something (I ended up choosing Activia so I could get some probiotics) that my morning queasiness wouldn\u2019t last as long. \n\nSince then, it has been pretty routine, waking up early to use the bathroom (it\u2019s mostly no longer diarrhea) and while I haven\u2019t puked in a little bit, \n\nI\u2019ve hesitating posting about it, and haven\u2019t gone to the doctor because I\u2019m not sure if this is really anything serious, and also, I\u2019m broke. I can\u2019t afford to go, especially if this isn\u2019t a big deal.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Those days my stomach muscle(?) must get pulled because the pain is excruciating to where I can only be in fetal position sometimes an hour, sometimes 3 hours, between puking up absolutely nothing. These days are really rare to be honest. It is the constant feeling that is beyond frustrating, I can throw up at any given point if I want to. I originally got told it was terrible acid reflux. I adjusted my diet and took nexium for weeks on end, to no avail. The diet improvement made my mood a bit better but the throat is still constantly thick. Then I got told it was anxiety, which i do get bad spells so saw a counselor, started working out. The diet and exercise helped with anxiety and overall feeling but did nothing for my throat.

have not income and use Medicare or whatever is free for alduts jobless in their early 20s I\u2019m not sure but very worried that I have cancer not a cyct today I was reading on my iPad and ended up feeling my earlobe while reading and then felt a pea sized lump inside of my left earlobe then while mad that I receive this lump in the same place again after it was gone when I pierced my earlobe and gently removed one already it was a pain to do as I dislike pain so I google treatments and people talking about cyst and ear piercing also mentioned cancer and tumors so I looked up how to tell the difference between cancer tumors and cysts but only got more worried \n\nI\u2019m 6 ft tall male 21 most of the time I eat lots and weight around 160 pounds I\u2019ve had a loss of apatite and that changed my weight as it would I now weight about 133 to 128 based on my weekly meals / what is available to eat but I have noticed changes in my energy to even sleeping for 19 hours I still wake up groggy and get fatigued by everyday exercise and before 1 and a half years ago I would do all the time I also have very large changes in pooping like constipation to liquid and a nearly 100% increase in burping and farting in my case is a alarming amount I almost nearly never burped for my first 20 years of life to the point that I only burped before I\u2019d puke and was a instant red flag for being sick in hindsight but I just noticed that while typing this also the lumps are inside my earlobe are the hardness of a pebble but also cause pain when in contact with my bed note I sleep on my stomach with my head to the side so my ears are pressed against my bed all the time but I\u2019m 60 to 70 % confiden it\u2019s if not cancer a tumor that\u2019s none malignant but the other symptoms point to it only been noticed after the second lump in my earlobe as I\u2019ve already remove the first 1 a year ago and now I have a new lump in the other earlobe on the right earlobe also an pebbles hardness and a 3/8 the size of the other which is roughly the size of a green pea and they both hurt also I have low to medium undisclosed hearing loss my left ear rings when there\u2019s a absence of sound of a unknown amount at the time it\u2019s ringing the only sounds are my keyboard ac outside of my room behind concrete and insulation and drywall and a glass window with drapes and shutters of metal over the glass at her than that the house is at around the most quiet it will be at any time other than powers out and everything and everyone is sleeping or not there at the time any way my hearing lose isn\u2019t related but hasn\u2019t gotten worse or changed but the people said the it\u2019s a tumor if it\u2019s not tender and feels like you can move it around and have pain from contact but it\u2019s hurting to wear headphones that aren\u2019t in or on ear but over ear headphones also I can\u2019t afford cancer and will be in permanent debt and can\u2019t even get places that take poor people healthcare my pcp has a appointment for me in about a 6 month or 1 year from a few days ago last week it\u2019s I think around the first next year but I\u2019m not even sure if it\u2019s all a everything that s not really connected just kind of fitting into place around the same time or my health problems being a cause of a fast but unnoticed change in my eating and my thoughts have been easy to get lost or get into loops or repeating thoughts to my self (example I\u2019ll read something and get on and internal monologue related to the line I read or see while listening and following along even more specifically a YouTube video by emkey I watched played for about 3 minutes and then around 3:34s it switches story\u2019s and I\u2019d still been thing about one line in the comment that was in the middle and had been past by already but when I realized this I came to the realization I\u2019d just repeatedly read the same line 3 or 4 times for no reason other than I\u2019d not noticed yet and now I\u2019ll find myself doing it 2 times before I related but sometimes back in school I had to re read lines to pronounce and comprehend that 1 line a few times no more than 3 to 5 times and the last 2 of 5were just out of place  every time it happened I fear that I might have had slow growing cancer unnoticed internally and it\u2019s in my colon and the combination of these symptoms are a red flag of death and that saying I\u2019m fine because I\u2019m not puking or shifting or pissing blood probably is a bad mind set to have but I\u2019ve also lost so much weight over a 8 month period that my body has acclamation to mild hunger pain to the point my subconscious has turned off most hunger pain in the mind set of food shortages but I\u2019ve got lots of food to eat but I\u2019m not satisfied with it and I\u2019ll eat as much as I can but I\u2019ve made a change in what I want I crave lots of high protein foods like meat an in particular hamburger meat  and other high in protein meats and I\u2019ve gotten to the point of making sure to go by the weight of food instead of calories because it\u2019s 1 to 1 scale with body weight so I just look at actual weight in pounds and ounces and try my best to eat 3.5 pounds and drink 1.5 or whenever I\u2019m thirsty but I struggle to hit 3.5 pounds of food and end up having excessive gas and blotting when eating bread of any kind no this is new I\u2019m not alerigic to gluten that over diagnoses and ever more self diagnosing with no evidence I\u2019m almost convinced gluten allergies don\u2019t exist or are placebo effects and people really are just that stupid lots of things like that piss me off especially adhd and other made up reasons to sell kids parents drugs for normal 5 to 15 year old behavior it\u2019s gotten out of hand where we\u2019re giving low dose speed to kids being kids and having fun and not sitting still keeps other things animals alive yet it\u2019s now a problem because of shit teachers that should teach only their own kids at best \n\nTl;dr lump in both earlobes size of green pea and smaller related symptoms and possible none related are fatigue and change in what I like to eat to the point of not eat if not in that group of food poop changes none blood changes just incandescent and day to day changes lumps fit the tumor side rather than cyst due to the hardness and shape of them but also have contact and pressure pain none related hearing loss but noted that it\u2019s not getting worse than what it has always been also my burping has gone from never unless I\u2019m puking to a daily and some times every meal thing in 8 months also all bread I\u2019ve tried make me blotted and gassy and no one wants that so a avoid most bread and eat or try to eat burgers and high protein fora and I find myself walking to my kitchen looking for something and finding nothing and coming back In a few minutes to do the same also a change in my ability to focus on reading \nSorry side rant aside I\u2019m going to get these check but I\u2019d like the best guess as to it\u2019s a go to the er and get cancer tests or it\u2019s probably best to get and early appointment with my pcp as soon as possible but don\u2019t jump straight to cancer", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

My mother had taken me to doctor after doctor, but kept getting the same answer, \"Its just growing pains, they'll stop...\" But by the time i was 17 we knew it wasnt growing pains. So i went to a podiatrist. After doing some xrays they said the xrays were somewhat normal. So i went for an MRI scan. I had a *lot* of junk in my ankles. Some bone shards and things, so my podiatrist tried giving me steroid injections, which worked for only a few days. So after that i tried othotics. Again, no help.\n\nSo i saw him again, and he decided to schedule me for an ankle arthroscopy. My doctor was shocked! He said my ankle joint was so cloudy, that he couldnt even tell he was in the joint... So he removed some of the shards and other things, and found out im loosing cartilage in *both* my ankles. So after clearing both my ankles out i was fine for about a year. Then i went back to him again. And eventually i was sent in for ANOTHER surgery. This time he lengthened my calf muscle. He did my left leg first, then my right a few months later. This lasted me about 3 years, so, i saw him one last time. He wanted me to get a cadaver donated ankle, and refereed me to another surgeon that was more adept at the surgery. This was only earlier this year. I saw a new podiatrist. And he took xrays, my left ankle only had 0.3 mm of space left. When it should be about 7 mm. My right ankle was only slightly better. So he had told me that the doner ankle replacement has a high rate of failure. So he scheduled me for a different surgery that was a bit dramatic, an ankle fusion surgery. That was on June 3rd of this year. When he did that, he found that i only have 5% cartilage left in my ankle.\n\nI saw him again, i think in early August. He reffered me to a rheumatologist to see if there was a reason that im losing so much cartilage. My rheumatologist scheduled me for a Nuclear Bone scan. So i had that done, and he told me theres inflammation in my ankles, and worse yet, its moving into my knees. He tested my blood, and it said i tested positive for an autoimmune disease... i think anyway, this is what it said. \"ANA IgG, Detected\" \n\nIf any of you can recommend anything!

Tried taking a nap, eating more food in case it was a calorie thing because I ate a little less than normal yesterday. Also might be of note that i drank 3/4 a gallon of milk yesterday, a multivitamin and 4 tums because of bad acid reflux (diagnosed GERD week ago waiting for prescription to become available)\n\nNormally my heart rate through the day is about 57-75. Today its been as low as 52 and as high as 185 (for like 30 seconds while walking according to my apple watch), but in case that was a fluke it's peaked at about 133. However, every time I stand up today I get varying levels of headrushes, and my BPM spikes from 65/75 - 95-120. To my knowledge this isn't common daily for me, but seems to be just an issue today.\n\nWhat could be the cause of it and what can I do to fix it? I am now very fatigued and feel hotter than normal today and just want whatever this is to end.

Random muscle/bone/connective tissue issues everywhere", "author": "its_that_sort_of_day", "self_text": "30 yo, female, 5'7\", 125 lbs, white, USA. \n\nTL;DR - Is there something that would cause many different distinct muscle pains (not just full body pain) to appear over time? Would include multiple kinds of headaches, sharp stabbing pains in ribs and wrist, and lead to easily damaged muscles that don't heal well.\n\nI have a range of diagnoses that clutter my medical chart (full list at the end). What I'm wondering about is a heck of a lot of different kinds of muscle/skeletal pain. I have migraines, tension headaches, ice-pick headaches, neck pain, back pain, rib pain, pelvic pain, and wrist pain. Each has been treated as a separate thing. I've got explanations on some but also counter-explanations. Others just don't have an answer. I'm wondering if there's anything that would explain all of them that would lead to different treatment.\n\nCurrently, this is as much of an answer as I have: My vertebrae are too tall, so the curve of my spine is off (not scoliosis and not something a doctor would diagnose, just something the PT and chiro say) and/or I just have bad posture. This puts tension on my neck and ribs. On my neck, that causes the debilitating tension headaches that I get nearly yearly and need physical therapy for for months at a time. (Therapy eases the flare up, but home exercises never really increase strength or stop a return.) The tension on my ribs strains my chest muscles, causing spasms and an \"ice-pick side ache\" that stops me in my tracks. Each physical therapist has given completely different methods to treat it from posture and neck control to connective tissue release (?) and general back strengthening or ultrasound and electrical stimulation. Chiropractics got the ice-pick side aches to completely disappear for a few years. When they returned, chiropractics seemed to make other back pain worse, so we've stopped. This \\*may\\* also be the cause for the pelvic pain which started in high school as a \"wear and tear\" injury from karate and was \"probably\" a bulging disc. It's never healed completely and ended my time in karate as I can't do a side kick without it flaring up.\n\nThis doesn't explain the wrist pain, which I'd describe as either a \"ice-pick wrist ache\" or one of my wrist bones popping out of place. It's excruciatingly painful for about a minute, stops me in my tracks, and I can't move my wrist until it's over. Then I roll my wrist and the pain won't go away completely until I hear a few clicks. (No initial injury or trauma.)\n\nThe migraines are a family issue with my sister's migraines much worse than mine. I generally only get knocked out for about half a day with only a few cases of multiple day migraines.\n\nThe reason I'm looking for help now is because this year has ramped up to a new level. In April I got a new \"wear and tear\" injury, this one in my back from...life? It was the worst pain I've ever felt. When the ER doctor touched my back, I started hyperventilating and crying without even realizing it. X-rays say no bone issues. Sports medicine guessed I injured my rhomboid muscle. Acupuncture was the only thing that helped (I went in completely skeptic and was surprised). The pain went away, but the muscle never got strong again. I could do everything: walking, typing, doing house chores, picking up and playing with my toddler, exercising on my stationary bike. Except sway my arms like when dancing or doing my PT exercises. That would make the pain flare up again for a full day. And the tingly nerve pain that came from too much bed rest still flared up as well, long after I'd returned to my normal activities. (A neck MRI says no pinched nerve high enough to explain why all four limbs have had some of this). \n\nThe back pain was replaced by a month-long headache spree (migraine-ish but not full migraines), so I wasn't really healthy for the interlude.\n\nNow we're back to the back pain. I tried to push a tiny bit with my PT exercises and it's back to the same terrifying level of pain as when I first injured it. Scheduled to see sports medicine on Wednesday, probably a back MRI after that. My primary care doctor doesn't understand why it's happened again.\n\nMy question is this: My whole life I've had weird pains and weak muscles and repetitive issues. Is there something everyone is missing? Is there something we're not treating? Any advice would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nFull list of diagnoses: Migraines, Tension headaches, Atypical bipolar II, Seasonal affective disorder, Anxiety disorder, Eustachian tube dysfunction, Thyroid nodules (potentially pre-hashimoto disease - family history), IBS, lactose intolerance, plantar's warts (for 20 years, literally.

What I'm wanting to know is whether this could be tied to autoimmune/systemic stuff.\n\nRecent history: two weeks ago I started getting lower abdominal pain, burning, and cramping. I have IBS type problems so I assumed it was that and I didn't connect it to the mild aches in my testicles because I've had that for years too. 5 days ago I went on a walk for exercise and that night my testicles started hurting more and I noticed they were swollen. Within a couple hours it felt like I had just been hit in the nuts but it was just persisting. I went to the ER the following day and they initially said epididymitis. Ultrasound showed a \"small hydrocele\" on my left testicle and \"mild thickening of the scrotum.\" ER doc said epididymitis doesn't always show on ultrasound. At my follow up today they told me urinalysis for UTIs and gonorrhea, etc were negative. My current guidance is to take Ibuprofen every 8 hours for 3 - 5 days and to continue the doxycycline that I got from the ER. Also, in the last two months I started walking 2 - 3 miles or using an elliptical for 30 - 40 minutes two or three times a week.\n\nLonger history: I had some aches and chaffing issues probably 2008 - 2011 and I had a larger hydrocele drained and stitched in 2011. About a year ago I started having aches and tenderness in my testicles, painful ejaculation, pain in my shaft during intercourse, and just a weird change in sensation. Some of it I chalked up to SSRI medication problems. I saw a urologist that recommended I switch to briefs from boxers and that seemed to reduce, not eliminate, the aches and tenderness in my testicles.\n\nI'm also diagnosed with fibromyalgia and inflammatory arthritis.

Its weird because sometimes the pain feels like breathing worsens it, or moving worsens it, and other times neither of those do. When it does hurt its a sharper pain in a focused area, not a dull ache. Theres also pain in my left shoulder. Its a burning sort of ache.\nThis happened twice awhile back earlier this year.

Possible anaemia.", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "18F\n\nI've had mental health problems since 12 and have been trying different mental health experts for about 2 years. About to go for an ADOS test in 2 weeks. My more physical symptoms started towards the summer of this year.\n\nMaking my mental health worse is a constant fatigue and headaches. Like, sometimes I'm taking naps in the afternoon (which I've never done before) and sometimes I'm literally asleep on my feet, and my arms but especially my legs feel unsteady and floppy. I have headaches after I coming back home from somewhere. I cannot mentally process much and my speech frequently comes out slurred because I'm tired.\n\nI don't know if it's caused by 1. My mental health issues and my attitude of doom and gloom, 2. Possible anaemia or 3. Waking up at night because of restless legs that in turn may be caused by possible anaemia or mental health problems\n\nI may be anaemic based on some blood tests. But the problem is that I took a blood test a little over a week after I donated a pint of blood (where I stupidly forgot to tell the doctor). The blood test came through the mail showing I had lower levels of haemoglobin and iron than normal and with it came a prescription for iron pills. I did not go for the pills because I was convinced the results were because of my blood donation.\n\nI have an appointment with my doctor at the end of September, who's actually a gynecologist treating me for PCOS, but it will take up to 2 months to get another blood test result because that's government hospitals for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really don't want to have anaemia and I don't want to spend months thinking I have it when my symptoms may be caused by something else. But for what it's worth:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Fatigue, tiredness, headaches? Check\n* Restless leg syndrome which can be caused by both mental health problems and anaemia? Check\n* Pale skin? No. Not possible because I am a bit dark.\n* White under-eyes? Not sure. They're not white but they're not a deep red either.\n* Less heavy period flow? No.\n* Not eating enough meat? Probably. My diet has changed quite a bit over the past year. I dislike the vast majority of meat, including fish. The rare time I have meat, it's in a sweet sauce or it's the occasional slice of ham. Before my mother used to make me eat her terrible cooking, but she eventually stopped doing that. To make matters worse, summer is so hot that it kills my appetite for anything meaty and I just crave fruit and salad. I estimate that for most of the summer I've eaten 1-2 portions of meat a week, but lately I've been trying to do an effort to eat more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention this thing until it came up again. For the past 3 years, exactly when my diet became more restrictive, I've been having a sort of fungus/dry skin at the corners of my mouth. It springs up 2-3 times a year and only goes away with a medicinal gel. Tbh all the more reason that I could have some nutrient defficiency.

My mother is living with daily pain and no one can help her.\n\nMy mother is a caucasian woman in her mid 60's. She has been on the heavier side for most of her life, fluctuating between a healthy weight and overweight but not severely overweight.\n\nIn the last year she has developed a \"lump\" on her side around her buttocks/hip area on one side only. It is less of a bump and more like that entire area of her body has grown in size disproportionate to the rest of her body. The area is very sensitive and causes her pain, especially when she sits for long periods of time. Due to breaking her ankle a few years back and plantars fasciitis, she can't spend long on her feet either and has no choice.\n\nIt grew very quickly, over the course of a few weeks, and though it has slowed down we think it is still slowly growing. Doctors have speculated that it may be a tumor or a lipoma, but it doesn't quite look or behave like a tumor, and the doctors say that if it were a lipoma it should not cause her pain and should show up on an MRI. The trouble is after many tests including two MRIs, none have shown a differentiation between her normal fat cells, and the \"sick\" fat cells, or what would be a lipoma. They have not done any biopsys because they cannot see a differentiation between the new and old (normal) fat cells. \n\nHer physician has referred her to a podiatrist (I'm not sure why) and an oncologist as well as a plastic surgeon. All of them have said her problem is not under their specialist umbrella or that its not their job and have said they can't help her. Her physician has now also said that they don't know what it is and that there is nothing they can do for her.\n\nWe are now after a year back at square one. She is desperate to have this removed as it is quite large and visible to others, and causes her a lot of discomfort and pain on a daily basis. She goes to acupuncture which helps to manage the pain, but it always returns. Shes worried that it is still growing, and that it might be starting on the other side as well. She is highly discouraged and disparaged after being shut down and turned away so many times. We don't know where to go from here. There is no real next step here, and I'm reaching out with the hope that someone might be able to suggest anything at all for us. While she has the option to get liposuction on it, this is deemed a cosmetic procedure because all of her tests have been inconclusive, and she cannot afford it. If we could get some kind of medical diagnosis, the procedure would be covered under OHIP (we live in Ontario, Canada) and she could finally get some relief. \n\nIf anyone here has any ideas, theories, suggestions, knows someone who has gone through something similar, if there is anything at all that you can add here we would be eternally grateful!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(cross-posted to r/AskDocs)", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I am terrified to get checked out because Doctor Google has convinced me I have cancer. \n\nOver a year ago, I saw my PCP because my jaw/TMJ. It had gotten really bad and painful to the point of clicking constantly for months. She gave me some exercises, but it still took months for it to get somewhat better. \n\nDuring that time, one of my ears got \u201cclogged\u201d and I felt like I had a sinus or ear infection. Went to a walk in clinic, they said I was fine and no ear infection. Ear remained clogged, and noticed my tonsil on that side was slightly swollen (or at least sticking out more than usual). Had a follow up with my PCP and asked if the jaw/tonsil/ear could be related, she said she didn\u2019t see anything wrong with either my ear or my tonsil besides a small tonsil stone- and those issues wouldn\u2019t be related.\n\nWell, it mostly did except for my ear. There\u2019s no pain- but a lot of congestion in that ear and on that side of my face/sinuses. Nasal sprays and OTC decongestants help a little with sinuses, but nothing helps ear. And my tonsil still looks kind of swollen in comparison to the other side (it juts out, where the other tonsil is tucked away if that makes sense?). It doesn\u2019t seem to have gotten larger at the very least. It\u2019s harder to swallow from that side when it\u2019s really congested (if my allergies are bad for instance). \n\nSince three visits basically told me I was fine I tried to wait it out. But it\u2019s been over a year of Eustachian tube dysfunction so I know I need to see an ENT. But I feel like since I used to smoke, and no one saw anything in my ears OR throat, I must have a cancerous tumor further down or internally. Hoping the reddit docs can help me with any other OTC solutions to try, maybe some other common things it could be (could I have had a middle ear infection for this long?) or just encouragement to go to the in real life ENT.\n\nBefore anyone asks this, and because of \u201cprior medical history\u201d info- a lot of this happened right as I got pregnant. So I had to switch all of my medical care to my OB and she brushed it off, then newborn, now anxiety because it\u2019s been so long.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

The day after I scratch a lot, it's covered with some white stuff which comes off when I rub it using a wet finger (and sometimes when I'm sweating).\n\n\nIt started when I was 15 or 16, I don't remember exactly. I remember that it started with itchiness when I went to pee in the night before sleeping. I used to spend minutes in the toilet scratching it without knowing what it was. Next significant change I remember is the skin getting dark, this was when I was around 17. The night itchiness was still there but it was occasional, like once a week. I was adding weight at that time so I thought that skin's getting dark down there because my thighs are getting larger around the crotch. I used to wash the area with soap (I know, big mistake). \n\nFast forward to 19. I'm gonna see a skin specialist next week. I still would like to know what it could be and what can I do to reduce/treat it. It's getting very bad, I hope my skin color gets back to normal.

Last MRI was 2 years ago) for the last couple of years.\n\nA few months ago, I had a small coughing fit and had a fairly intense sharp pain in that area (upper right side, front temporal area), that lasted only a couple of seconds (with no residual effects), but it left me a little worried as to what might be going on, as many of the internet searches I have done on the issue, returns suggestions that it could be something like an aneurysm; and that unilateral cough headaches are very rare.  \nThankfully, for the next few months the pain never returned when coughing (though my 'regular' head pains I previously mentioned have continued), but I just recently developed a cold, and today it happened again a couple of times. The same brief, sharp pain coming on with a hard cough.\n\nAside from the occasional 'cough pain' and a mild cold, I feel pretty great at the moment.

They removed the mass and did the sinus surgery and found out I had chronic polyposis. \n\nOn top of all this,  my ENT doctor performed an adenoidectomy during the sinus surgery,  because she said that problems with adenoids can cause ear popping.

I have no welts whatsoever and have not been itchy at all, but that day (and then again today because her legs and feet are covered in welts) we tore the room apart looking for bed bugs and no dice. the beds are clean, no blood stains no fecal matter, nothing, just white, clean beds. I checked the box spring, areas around the bed but I just cant find the little guys if they exist.\n\nMy next thought was she is allergic to something, but if she was allergic to the detergent used to clean the sheets, wouldnt that affect her whole body and not just legs and feet? She did buy a new pair of jeans that she wore without washing them, and the hives got progressively worse, but she did have a few before she even bought the jeans. I am stumped.

He was admitted to the hospital and released to rehab upon accepting they couldn\u2019t find a cause. They put him on an anti clotting medicine just to be safe. He aced rehab physically, mentally got a bad case of aphasia. He was then released home with me for 4 days while we began teaching him all the things he had trouble with from the left sided stroke. \n\nOn about the 4/5th day he woke me up at 1am with extreme stomach pain, took him to ER and found out he had a blood clot hit his spleen. They cleared it, and kept him for two days looking for another cause. Nada. They did almost every scan they could(according to them) heart looked perfect, everything looked good except some small buildup on the aorta from years of smoking that they said could have caused it but unlikely. Released again this time on xerelto (sp?). \n\nA day later, more stomach pain, so I bring him back and we\u2019re here a bunch of different explanations. First doc (ER doc) said that the anti blood clotting meds made a bunch of blood rush to the dead part of the spleen causing it to expand and create pain (33% of his spleen was killed off by the clot) the next doc (his current main doc) said it was because the blood in his spleen is clotting and healing? She put him on fluids and said in 2 weeks she thinks the spleen should heal and be fine. \n\n\nHere\u2019s the weird part, this 3rd admission to the hospital he started having mini seizure like activity, back arching, eyes glossing etc. keep in mind all the years I\u2019ve lived with him and even post stroke he\u2019s never had a seizure. The only time I\u2019d noticed this kind of behavior is when I\u2019d bring him to the ER for the spleen and they\u2019d give him daliaudid, fentynol and morphine for the pain because one would not take care of it, then the back arching would start.\n\nHowever, now he does it randomly while lying in the hospital bed: they gave him anti seizure meds and it still continued.\n\nThey also found out they could \u201csnap him out\u201d of the seizures by poking his foot with something sharp and he was able to do the whole \u201csqueeze my hands, wiggle your toes\u201d things right after coming out of them.\n\nThey told us this means they aren\u2019t \u201creal\u201d seziures but could be caused from the pain of his spleen healing.\n\nHowever, they took eeg tests, ct scans, everything short of an MRI because he can\u2019t sit still for a fulll hour and everything looks clean. \n\nThe other day one of these \u201cpsuedo seizures\u201d were so bad he almost swallowed his tongue and had to have a rapid response team called to keep him alive. He also is constantly sleeping and lethargic with no medical explanation as to why. \n\n\nToday I noticed my dad has really bad seizures  when his work friend came to visit and he tried to engage in conversation with him. One of the first days it seemed like me taking with him also may have triggered it but other times he goes long periods without one.  \n\nAlso side note, yesterday my dad made it all day with only a Percocet for pain, no morphine fentnyol or anything and never once had a seizure, and he was happy for awhile too!\n\nToday they gave him morphine around 9am because he was throwing up the percocet and had many seizures...coincidence? Maybe, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\n\n\nMy dad is the strongest man I know and he\u2019s been telling me he\u2019s ready to die and doesn\u2019t want to do this anymore.

It is EXTREMELY rare for it to take 10 minutes or less. So when I say \"normal time to sleep\" or anything like that, I mean this amount of time, which isn't, in fact, normal for most people. And a lot of times (Maybe like 2-3 times a week? Depends on sleep schedule.) take me a solid hour or 2 just to fall asleep, and it's always been super annoying. It leads to me staying up a lot just so I can get tired enough to fall asleep faster. If I'm not pretty tired when lying down it will always take FOREVER.                         \n\nNinja Edit for Submission Info guideline -- Age:20, Gender: Male, Height:5'11\", 220 pounds, White, Mississippi USA, Been happening for as long as I can remember, only pre-existing symptom is Allergies bad enough I get shots for it.

Yesterday night I couldn't sleep, I tried for 2 hours then gave up and got back on my PC to watch shows, and just ended up staying up all night. (Woke up the day before at 2pm, Started trying at 3am, gave up at around 5am). Well, I went to my girlfriend's around 12pm. We watched a movie or 2, then figured we would try and at least take a nap (around 5:30pm. This is where it gets interesting.                  \n\nMy perspective: I am laying behind her as big spoon for awhile, trying to go to sleep. After enough time I get slightly uncomfortable and feel like turning over. Then say something about how annoying it is to be this tired and still not sleep.\n\nWhat REALLY happened: I lay there for about 5 minutes at most, then fall asleep. She actually took a recording of me snoring. I then sleep for maybe 10 minutes, before waking up again and turning over, then saying the comment. She immediately said I was wrong and showed me the video. Said she hadn't moved at all to prompt me to wake up when I did. (Took the video at start of me snoring.)              \n\nNot only did all of that happen, but I did realize I was slightly more rested so it was harder to go back to sleep again after all of that happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRANDOM INFO THAT MIGHT BE USEFUL. Don't know if it's all relevant but just in case.  \n* I never fall asleep randomly when I'm not trying. Aka when driving, working, etc. No narcolepsy type stuff I'm aware of.\n* When working an 8-5 job over the summer (waking up at 7am), I would be screwed for Monday cause of the weekend staying up late, but after Tuesday or so I almost always be able to sleep around 12am-1am. I might just not be remembering the times I couldn't though as it's not really out of the ordinary.\n  * Although this sleep schedule was consistent, I went through every day not at 100%. Aka tired to some degree, some days worse than others.\n* Using Melatonin puts me down, but makes me have CONSTANT dreams and waking up throughout the night, causing a LOT of confusion and annoyance. Also causes fear depending on the % of nightmares lol.\n* Using Benadryl/Cough Syrup usually helps. It isn't like crazy good but definitely helps me get down, I just don't feel like it's good to rely on those for every single night of sleep.\n* A lot of times it feels like I just can't make my thoughts shut up. Like I constantly think about stuff and can't sleep. A great night is one where I'm so tired I don't even think of stuff, I just lie there and fall asleep relatively quickly.\n* I make it a point to NOT use my phone while trying to sleep, like not checking it or anything. I read a lot about this being a problem for people. So I only look at it to get a sense of how much time has passed over I know I've been lying there for ages.\n* To be fair, I don't exercise, which I've heard is bad, but at the same time what they call \"bad from no exercise\" has always been my base, even when I DID exercise practically every day.\n\nSo, people of reddit, WTF is happening? Was this just because of the lack of sleep from before (I was exhausted), or could this be the reason I can't fall asleep so often? I had literally no idea I had slept at all.

I've applied it a few times and I'm not done but the skin tag is receding. I'm so happy I didn't have to pay a doctor $2000 to do this.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\nI have a prince albert piercing that due to the upward pull of too-tight jewlery formed an overly sensitive skin tag. I know it doesn't really fit the definition of skin tag by how it formed, but it's a big bump that's barely attached to my skin and if I can help it I don't want to pay $7000 to remove something that seems within reach of removing for free. I just threw that number out there, I don't know what it would cost to remove, but if a doctor would do it for under $1000 I would definitely get it done professionally. Here's why: there's a skin tag removal recommendation where you tie floss around to cut off circulation and it'll eventually fall off. I had floss wrapped around it and after an hour looked and was startled by how black it looked. I know that's the point of cutting off circulation but with how little skin there is I figured it would be a wait of a matter of hours. I looked it up and no, they expect you to leave it on for 10 days, after which point it should finally fall off. I'm worried that 10 days of leaving dead skin attached could lead to bigger problems. Even if it is barely attached by anything, I wouldn't want that cell death to spread. I really wish I could get a strong anesthesic and just cut it off myself. No worry about dead skin, and as it's so little area it should clot quickly. What do you think? Can I get my hands on an anesthesic, would necrosis not spread if I use the floss method, or do I really need to go the route of surgery?\n\nUpdate: nevermind, I'll get surgery. I'm leaving this up just as a warning. This was very risky of me to attempt, and while it can be expensive, no matter what your medical problem, you should always get professional help.

I am a 21 year old male college student.\n\nIn September 2015, a classmate was messing around and pressed his fists into my chest with lots of pressure until we heard a snapping noise from my chest. I experienced sharp pain in my sternum for only one day and heartburn for two weeks after this incident. Afterwards, everything seemed to be fine and I never really experienced any more pain for about 2 and \u00bd years until April 2018, when I landed on my chest while snowboarding. I started experiencing sharp pain and popping sounds in my sternum a week later and it has been there ever since. Since this incident I have gone to over 20 doctors and tried countless treatments, including 5 procedures under general anesthesia, but nothing has made any significant difference. I mainly experience sharp pain in my sternum when I move my upper body and lift things. I also experience sharp pain and pressure when I take a deep, and sometimes even small, breaths. This prevents me from doing just about any physical activity. I added a chart that gives a summary of some of the things I have tried in the past.\n\nMost recently, I got an Xray of my spine in late June, 2019 and then again in mid- August. I will attach them below. I saw this chiropractor 9 times a week for adjustments from July 3rd to August 29th, 2019. After seeing her, I think that I have had some improvement in my mood and energy, but still no significant change in my chest pain. The X Rays showed improvement in my spine alignment. As you might be able to see, my fractures and misalignments seem to be getting better.\u00a0\n\nThe closest diagnosis that I have is costochondritis. Several doctors have suggested this based on my symptoms, but none of the normal treatments have worked. Other physical therapists and chiropractors have told me that they feel hardened tissue along my sternum. The MRI that I took in August 2018 showed a little bit of inflammation in my chest.\n\nIf anyone has experienced anything similar with any level of treatment success I would be very grateful to hear about it... thank you very much", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I get burning pains that feel like many needles being poked into my skin whenever I am stressed or sweat mildly. Minimal physical activity will cause the pain such as lifting objects or walking outside. Pain occurs all over the body but sometimes can be localized. General situations that cause stress result in pain all over, typically chest, back, arms legs. Eating hot food would centralize the pain on the face, head or neck. Anything that would make you warm enough to sweat such as warm clothing or sunlight causes the pain. So I typically wear much thinner clothes and jackets that most people. \n\nWhen a situation arises that flares up the pain it typically comes very quickly, within a few seconds. When I can move to a place to cool down or avoid the stress the pain typically goes away within a few minutes. There isn't anything I can see physically during or after the pain except in very rare instances. When the pain is exceptionally bad sometimes some very tiny little pimple like things form and then almost instantly pop or get rubbed off on my legs or arms, maybe other areas. But this only happens maybe a few times a year. \n\nMale, around age 15 to late 20s, so well over a decade. Same location in western USA, California, for that duration. It also only occurs in winter or when the average temperature drops below around 70F. The warm half of the year I do not have this problem. I do know that if I go to an area that is cold for a period of time the pain will come back within 48 hours. For example, staying indoors at hotels that are air conditioned in the 60-70F range can bring the pain back even if it is the middle of summer as I am being exposed to a continuously cool climate.\n\nStressful thoughts and whatnot cause the pain to, and it is certainly enough to hamper day to day activities and influences clothing and food choices (nothing mildly spicy, no hot liquids at all). As an example if there is a lot of pain I'll take off my jacket even if it is very cold outside. In one instance it I was on vacation and it was lightly snowing outside but a tee shirt in the snow was preferable to the burning pains.\n\nWhen there is a flare up the pain is fairly severe like other major pains and makes it difficult to do normal tasks. The problem is they occur regularly throughout the day and again once you remove yourself from a situation, there is little evidence or effect. \n\nI've been to doctors a few times and briefly saw a dermatologist. It was mostly useless and they suggested to try some lotions which were useless. Even if it was a solution it is impractical cover my whole body with them throughout the day. Other suggestions were that the pain is neurological. They suggested I take a blood test which I did although they claim there was nothing abnormal.\n\nI tried an over the counter drug, a generic version of Aller Tec which I believe was called Cetirizine. It didn't seem effective in the least. I was prescribed Doxepin 10 MG pills with the suggestion to take them before bed. This was worthless. If I took them during the day they would remedy the pain for 3-4 hours so if I was going somewhere stressful I'd take one 40 minutes beforehand however it made me extremely drowsy to the point I would fall asleep and was not able to do anything productive at all. And as mentioned, the effective window was short and not a full day solution. I was also prescribed Gabapentin with 300 MG capsules but I never actually took them and I believe they expired 2 years ago. I assume these are unsafe to try again this year?\n\nI haven't been back to the doctors in a few years. Not too sure what else to try.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

It is now clear and has a prominent yellow color to it (almost like pee but brighter). It has some whitish cloudy spots at first, then fades back to clear. Possibly related is a slight discomfort (not pain) towards the end of peeing and occasionally after ejaculating. Best way to describe the feeling is like stopping mid-pee and holding it. The discomfort is located just below my bellybutton and back an inch or so I think. Fairly localized feeling, not radiating. I have read some articles and the following information may be of use: no change in odor, no fever, no skin yellowing, not dark yellow.\n\nMore info:\nI\u2019m gay and mostly bottom. I\u2019ve topped only a couple times (peed after each time). Both me and my partner tested negative for standard tested STIs and neither of us have changed partners recently (5 months). I had a bad cold around the time the issue arose, the cold is gone but the issue remains. Issue arose gradually over a few days, now completely yellow (a couple times a little more normal, then back again). I\u2019ve peed clear after one instance so unlikely a mix of pee. Let me know if you need more info. I\u2019ll keep updating if things change or if I go to the doctor and get an answer. Thanks!\n\nUPDATE 9/19:\nWent to the doctor and peed in a cup. No blood or white blood cells detected in urine and urine culture came back negative. The doctor said is it probably a prostate infection and prescribed antibiotics.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

{"post_id": "d600fi", "created_utc": 1568823035, "title": "Feels like I'm being poked constantly- haven't slept right in 2 days. Nerves? Am i going crazy? (15 Y/O F)", "author": "zlepperburg", "self_text": "Further info about me: I have been on norethindrone (a form of birth control) since spring of last year (I'm sorry I'm not good with times.) though I don't know if that medication has this effect. I have no history of nerve damage or neurological disorders relating to skin pain at all.\n\nHonestly not sure how I'd title this actually but let me explain.\n\nSince April of 2018, I have been having random spurts of what I just call \"the tingles\". Basically what happens is that when I lay down to go to sleep, it feels like someone's got a sewing needle or pin and will just poke random areas of my skin with it. Let me clarify: this is NOT pins and needles. I know I literally just used the analogy of someone poking me with pins or needles but it isn't the same as what you'd call pins and needles. There is no numbing, and it isn't restricted to one area like my hand or foot. It also doesn't feel like a bunch of pins stabbing me over and over in one area, it's just a single poke on a random area. \n\nI don't know why, but every few months or so I'll get a string of nights where this'll happen every single time I try to go to sleep without fail. It doesn't matter what I do. I've tried to stop using technology before I go to sleep, my mom has tried putting lavender on me, I've drank and took all kinds of relaxants. I've tried sleeping with different blankets, different bedsheets, sleeping naked or sleeping with full body covering clothes like jackets and sweatpants. Nothing makes it stop. At first, it was mostly okay. It was an annoyance, but if I just manned up and sat through it I could eventually fall asleep. Back then it was more like \"tingles\" than it was stabs. Now it's different. The latest time it's come back it's full on pain. The severity changes slightly but sometimes the burst of pain is so bad it'll cause me to flinch and once the pain was so strong I actually made a noise out loud like a shriek. I cannot fall asleep anymore when I have this. In order to fall asleep now I have to stay up all night to wear myself out and only then can I fall asleep. And the thing is, once it starts, I can't get rid of it by just not sleeping. If I get up to just do other things to get rid of it and THEN try sleeping it will stay with me, so I'll have the tingling even while im awake and active and it will come back immediately after I lay down.\n\nI've tried looking everywhere to find out what this is and I've turned up nothing. Any search I do brings up pins and needles instead. I pretty much gave up on finding anything about this or if it happens to other people. I really want to get to the bottom of this because I haven't slept more than 6 hours total in the last 2 days- once I actually fall asleep with this, I'll usually only sleep a few hours or even just one before waking up from the pain and once I'm awake it's incredibly difficult to fall back asleep. I would have to spend all day trying to get enough sleep... To be awake at night I guess. \n\nWhat could this be? Is it nerve damage? Is it just my brain being an absolute bitch? My meds? The only logical explanation I could come up with was overstimulation, I have ADHD and I'm stimulated very easily but like I said this happens even if I starve myself of stimuli before going to sleep and if it was a case of overstimulation I have no idea why it only happens occasionally in random bursts. I've always used technology before bed without any issue and only stop using it before bed when this starts happening and that doesn't make it go away. The only other idea I have is that it's my medication/birth control but as far as I know this isn't a side affect of norethindrone. If you have any explanations or ideas I'd love to hear because I'm really eager to sleep longer than 3 hours tomorrow night.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Initially it wasn\u2019t frequent enough to notice a trigger. Now I know the trigger is pants/tightness around my abdomen (even seatbelt).

Nothing makes the pain worse besides standing up and remaining in tight pants. No change in bowel habits, nor does having a bowel movement change the pain, no bloating, no tenderness to palpating, no change with medicines (NSAIDs, Tylenol, bentyl, antacids, marijuana, CBD, alcohol) or with food intake.

Both taken for years.\n\n\\---------\n\nThis will be long, so bear with me.\n\nThis  all technically started in early September 2015 when I woke up one day  feeling... off. Like my body was swaying, as if I was a buoy in the  ocean. I thought I was just dehydrated or something and it would go  away. It didn't. It persisted for weeks. Blood tests, brain scan,  thyroid, everything came back normal. ENT said I was fine. Every doctor  said it was anxiety, and I was prescribed Zoloft by a psychiatrist (100  mg.) I had to take the semester off because it was dehabilitating. It  was consuming my mind every second of my day. Anyways, it went away 100%  around late October 2015, and I was able to complete my undergraduate  career and get my degree. It stayed gone for 4 YEARS (well, mostly...  more on that right now.)\n\nIn Fall  2018, I tried to wean myself off the Zoloft. Once I got down to 50 mg,  the symptoms returned. I immediately went back up in dosage to 100 mg,  and the symptoms went away in a few days.\n\nIn  June 2019, I moved across the country for grad school. This was the  first time by myself far away from home, so I was anxious, but very  excited. The first three months of grad school went perfectly. Fast  forward to early September 2019, and I'm still in grad school. One  night, I close my eyes to go to sleep and it feels like my body is  moving/swaying. The symptoms are back. I call my psychiatrist, and he  ups me to 150 mg of Zoloft. I've been taking the 150 mg for about 8 days  now, with no sign of relief.\n\nNow  usually, I wouldn't have a difficult time saying this is all anxiety. I  understand it can cause very real, and very weird physical symptoms.  HOWEVER... I do notice relief when I'm doing one thing: moving quickly.  Whether that's running, in a car, on my scooter, or whatever, the  symptoms will subside until I remain stationary again. Frankly, I'm sick  of this so I googled a ton today (not the best idea, but whatever.) I  found something called \"Mal de Debarquement Syndrome\", or MdDS. My  symptoms mirror this quite well, but there's two things that still don't  make sense. First, MdDS is predominantly seen in women, usually in  their 40-50s. Secondly, I did not travel by air or sea directly prior to  any of these symptoms occurring. But the fact that it goes away with  any fast/passive movement, which is an extremely common theme seen in  people with MdDS, has me very worried.\n\nI  really, really just need this one question answered: \\*If it was just  anxiety-based dizziness, why would it go away in a car? Or when I run on  the treadmill?\\* I'm so confused at this point, and super frustrated. I  was doing so well for years and years, and now the most traumatizing  experience of my life is back. I know I sound dramatic but it's the  truth. It consumes my brain constantly. I don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Except one thing they mentioned was there was a slight irregularity in my ECG. Went back to my family doctor the next day and he told me it was panic attacks that occur randomly and prescribed me some panic medicine called lorazepam sl. He told me to use it whenever the pain happens. But these days the pain/discomfort has been constant instead of episodes of pain. I just feel it somewhere in my chest like a mass or rock or gas bubble, it doesnt bother me too much except times where I feel sharp stabbing pains.

A few days ago I started actively paying attention to what and how much I\u2019m eating and I\u2019m now intentionally eating at least two full meals a day. I already can say that I feel better and my heart isn\u2019t pounding like crazy when I get up to walk 50 steps from my desk. Sounds kinda lame now, but this is a really big deal for me. \n\nThanks to the people who put my mind at ease and gave me good advice :) I greatly appreciate it and your comments made me realize nothing crazy is wrong with me, and I just need to change my habits!! Thank you :)\n\n\nORIGINAL POST:::::\n\nAge: 23\nGender:Female\nHeight/weight: 5\u20194\u201d/130 lbs\nRace: Caucasian \nLocation: USA\nNo pre-existing medical issues\nCurrent meds: B12 vitamin, iron supplement, vitamin D3 supplement\nDuration of complaint: year and a half (roughly)\n\nSymptoms: my heart rate spikes if I do ANY physical activity (getting up and walking a brisk pace for a minute). Heart also beats very hard, I can feel it pounding. \n\nThis is a long and confusing one, so thanks for bearing with me... about a year and a half ago, I went through a two week period where I was not eating enough (maybe eating one meal a day, and I was a very active person and a runner, so this was definitely not enough). During that time and ever since then, I\u2019ve had a messed up heart as far as I can tell. My heart pounds so hard with any physical exertion, and I mean ANY exertion. I sit at a desk job and if I even get up and walk for a couple minutes to get something, my heart is pounding and I\u2019m getting warm and maybe even a tad out of breath. I used to be in excellent shape, ran a few miles every day, felt good, had energy. Now I can\u2019t really even go to the gym because if I do and especially if I run, I get heart palpitations and flutters, and I just have no energy, can\u2019t push myself at all. \n\nI also recently (couple months ago) got a cotton wool spot on my right eye. Went to an ophthalmologist, she told me those are almost always due to high blood pressure, but any time that I\u2019ve gotten my blood pressure checked, it\u2019s great. The cotton wool spot has not fully gone away, which is concerning, but I can\u2019t afford to go to the ophthalmologist again for her to tell me the same thing as before. \n\nI also recently went to my regular doctor to get blood panels , and every thing came back normal except my vitamin d was low, so I now take supplements as of a week ago.\n\nMy theory is that the problem with my high blood pressure and palpitations are from a year and a half ago when I wasn\u2019t eating for those two weeks. I assume it damaged my heart. But at any rate, I\u2019m really frustrated because I miss working out and being active, and I just could use some insight from anyone who could have experienced or encountered anyone with the same problem as me. I will definitely be seeing the doctor again sometime to see if I can get some tests to see if my heart is having problems, but I\u2019d love to hear anything that could be helpful in the meantime. \n\nThank you for reading, I really am at the end of my rope and need any advice/encouragement you can offer.

Im a swimmer and sometimes I'll get water in my ear, which is normal, but when I do its all I can think about. I can only focus on it and will do anything to get it out of my ear: ie, using my finger, jumping up and down, trying to hold me ear open. I've never really thought this was a big deal until last night when I realized I had been sitting outside the sports club in the parking lot for 15 minutes trying to get water out of my ear. And then while I was biking home I was still trying to get it out of my ear. I kept freaking out wondering if I would get an infection of something and was almost going crazy. When I got home I used (even thought I had read not to) a very small q-tip and it was able to make my ear feel better and I am pretty sure it got the water out. When there's water in my ear I am consumed by it, I've been a swimmer for a long time and I just can't do anything else, constantly stopping during my practice to get it out or try to, getting very frustrated with myself.\n\n2. My nails ( if I think about it, I can't stop thinking about it until I forget ) feel like they're pressed up against my skin; so I'll pull my finger just a little away from my nails so there's air in between my finger and nail (just a little ) and it feels so much better. I've done this since I was really young, younger than the ear thing. \n\nThis is all I can think of right now, and I know it sounds like nothing but im just wondering if this is something I should be worried about or not.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I've had internal ultrasounds and even taken progesterone multiple times to force them, and it has worked but with really bad side affects (heavily bleeding for a month straight, losing 15+ pounds in a month, fainting, severe cramping that doesn't go away no matter how many pills I take, and all of this being caused by the severe anemia I developed that almost resulted in a blood transfusion (my iron saturation was 6, hemoglobin was 9.9 and this was a month after I finally stopped bleeding and didnt pass out from sitting up so I have no idea how low my blood levels actually got. I have all my lab results if they're helpful to anyone)).\n\nFor some reason I just never got it. I've had all of the standard hormone tests done multiple times and they always come back within normal range, ultrasounds have shown follicles but no one tells me what that means. My current gyno seemed so intent on helping me when I first started going to her, even getting outside colleagues opinions (her husband is an endocrinologist) yet it's been 2 years since I've seen her in person and her assistant is the only person I've been contacted by and she's no help whatsoever. The last time I saw her, I asked honestly why I never developed the womanly figure everyone has (I have no hips or butt, they actually cave into my body, my arms and legs are long and skinny, and I have very little breast development and my nipples just don't look like anyone else's nipples, it's just one stretch of pointed skin and doesn't have the little balled tip that normal nipples have.) and she said blatantly that I was underdeveloped and that she didn't know why and that whatever is wrong with me isn't anything she'd know about, but then wouldn't refer me to an endocrinologist. She said I'd be better off getting a genetic health screening done but I can't afford it so to just take the 23 and Me DNA test to see if I had any of the genetic problems they test for because it was more in my price range (if it helps any, my biological father was, according to my Ancestry DNA test results, 100% European Jewish. I was a one night stand baby so no chance of tracking him down, don't have anything other than a nickname to go off of. He was an immigrant to America sometime in the 80's-90's.) I kinda gave up on her after that and I guess she gave up on me as well.\n\nMy last time I went to this practice, I asked her assistant about children, since having a period is kinda required to get pregnant and they haven't even tested to see if I even ovulate or anything and she just told me that the only way they'd look into that is if I had been actively trying for over a year to get pregnant and hadn't. I was so pissed that that was the requirement for being taken seriously. The rest of the conversation went like this.\n\nMe: \"So if I wait till I'm, say, 27 to start trying to have a child because I'm finally ready and it takes over a year with no results, then you'll finally take me seriously? What if it takes 2 years or more to finally figure it all out only for you to tell me that there's nothing that can be done but if I'd have found the problem sooner it could have been fixed but now it's too late. Then what?\"\n\nHer: \"We can't prove that you can't until you try.\"\n\nThen when I had a pregnancy scare (it was all in my head, I'm crazy honestly) she told me blatantly that I couldn't be pregnant but to come in and get checked out anyway.\n\nI have a lot of health problems, but I figured this would be the easiest to fix, clearly I was wrong. My parents didn't take any of my problems seriously and still don't, constantly downplaying everything, including telling me I'm reading my results wrong and don't know what I'm talking about. I don't know if all of my problems fall into one condition or honestly if they even exist at this point, but anything is appreciated.\n\nMy physical measurements are: bust -40 inches but I don't even fill out my 36 A cup bras and 34 band is too tight, waist- 34 inches but can pull the measuring tape to 29 comfortably, hips- 35 inches and I'm 5'4 and weigh 139 pounds. I've also had the exact same measurements even when I weighed 165 pounds which is the heaviest I've ever been. I've lost almost 30 pounds and yet my measurements are the exact same? I'm big in size yet have no curves or anything and exercise regularly.\n\nMy other health problems include: recurrent ear infections as a kid and I apparently have something wrong with my eustachian tubes and they're misshapen and don't drain properly so I have hearing loss in both ears, joint pains and frequent dislocations with disproportionately long arms and legs but shorter torso (apparently I was predicted to be 5'8 when fully grown, again I'm barely 5'4), super brittle skin, nails and hair and no vitamins or anything work (the only vitamin I was deficient in was D but sorted that out), I have an incredibly low/nonexistent libido except for like 2 days a month or something if that, and then lots of mental issues that I've never been taken seriously for so I just deal with them as best as I can. The only medication I take is the Lo loestrin fe birth control. I can't think of anything else since it's 2:30am and I'm already nervous as hell posting this, I'll add more stuff later if I think of it or if I'm asked something specific. It's a lot and it's jumbled and the grammar sucks but I'm desperate here.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, the only off thing on my blood work has been my DHEA-S which has been around 60-75 ug/dL since I was first tested around 15 (I only got the results from that test after I started going to my current gyno in 2017, I've had some shit doctors). I've been on a supplement called Biosom and it's raised my levels to about 120 ug/dL but nothing has changed.\n\nThank you and I'm sorry for how long this is.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

Non-smoker and occasional drinker, but don't use drugs. My only medications are spironolactone and Yacette birth control as of a few weeks ago. No health problems apart from a slight hormone imbalance.\n\nI usually feel pain in my calf but it sometimes extends up into my lower thigh. It can be a deep, aching pain, especially at night, and I frequently have to take painkillers to sleep. At other times like extended walking periods, the pain feels more like a high pressure and feels like it's swelling up and getting hot, although when I look at it either isn't at all or only mildly.\n\nI find this incredibly distressing and I'm sure it's not normal. I waited a while for it to go away but it's only gotten worse over time.\n\nSome other symptoms that might be worth mentioning are: tenderness at the lower back of the calf, although both of my calves get this sometimes; I seem to get pins and needles more easily now; skin can get itchy in the upper calf/lower thigh; and even when not hurting, my leg always feels \u201cdifferent\u201d somehow.\n\nI'm really worried about varicose veins and deep vein thrombosis. Sometimes the veins on my thighs look a little raised, but they don't have the gnarled appearance of varicose veins.\n\nI'm thinking it could be a vein issue because from what I've looked up online I don't know what else it could be. I'm not a medical professional though, so there are probably a ton of possible causes I don't know about.\n\nI've been to a doctor recently who didn't seem to think it was a big deal. He felt the back of my calf and said I definitely didn't have a blood clot because my calf was soft and that I'd have screamed from pain from him pressing on it if that was the case.\n\nI'm sure it's nothing as serious as a blood clot but I don't want to wait around for something serious to develop.\n\nHe asked about my activity levels and I told him I was very sedentary(I'm a writer who works from home) because I know being sedentary can be a risk factor for a bunch of conditions, but he just laughed and told be to take painkillers and come back in a month if it was still bad.\n\nI was sent for a blood test for serum 25-HO vitamin D3 level, thyroid function, ferretin level, bone profile, and a full blood count and everything came back fine, although it wasn't explained to me why these things were being tested.\n\nI would love to get to the bottom of this.

It is literally impossible for me to nap because of it. I do get them at night sometimes, but not really that much.\n\nWhenever i try to take a nap, I get this weird kind of \"zooming in and out\" feeling while falling asleep. It sounds weird, but while i drift off and relax i get this zoom or in and out sensation in my head, a bit like a rollercoaster (i know it sounds weird af). Also, my muscles tense up and i sweat a little bit. Then, when i think i'am about to fall asleep, i very often get hypnic jerks. Moreover it feels like i am not really breathing unless i really focus on it.\n\nMost of the time i lay in bed for like 30min with these weird sensations and after getting up i'm a little bit covered in sweat and completely clueless as to what the hell is going on.\n\nI don't know if it is stress/anxiety or something else, but what really keeps me thinking is the connection to taking naps. Why does this primarily happen when i try to nap during the day, but not at night. I can feel relaxed during the day and try to nap but it will still happen and it really worries me.\n\nI also suffer from  other neurological and muscular problems (not related to napping), mostly tingling (only when laying down), sharp pain in muscles, burning sensation, tense jaw, sinus problems (pressure on the bridge of my nose), throbbing pain etc. These throbbing and pain sensations on my muscles mostly happen when i lay down and rest. I never get tingling or numbness while moving. \n\nI get a lot of muscle twitching , like micro twitching inside my muscles that sometimes is not even visible.\n\nI often wake up in the morning and my arms or legs really hurt, it goes away when i get up after a few minutes though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of this started a few years ago and it was way worse initially. It started after i smoked a joint and got horrible stomach cramps and tingling all in my body. I felt completely out of it for a few weeks with dizziness, numbness, tingling and cramps and shooting pains. It eventually got better but like i said, i still have some neurological problems which I could not solve and they also prevent me from good sleep.\n\nI've had all my blood levels checked, MRI of brain and neck, and EEG. everything seemed fine there but one thing that was odd to me is that i felt really panicky/dizzy during MRI and EEG.\n\nI keep telling myself it's just anxiety but i have no idea, i do not really suffer from panick attacks or anything like that.\n\nI hope someone can help.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

I just need to know what this may be caused by and if there is any way of improving it because I'm starting to question my own ability to function.\n\nI'm aware this is an extremely broad complaint which may be caused by any number of conditions so I'll offer up some basic information that I think might be relevant:\n\n* I get a good amount of sleep per day (8 hours or more), although my sleep schedule frequently goes in and out of phase with normal timing.\n* I eat a relatively good diet.\n* I do not drink, smoke, or use recreational drugs.\n* I'm rather reclusive - I don't leave the house much and don't get much social interaction.\n* I have struggled with eczema before, which I currently have under good control using a mixture of moisturisers. steroid creams and antihistamines (the latter two which I use whenever a flareup occurs).\n* My family has a history of allergies and skin issues.\n* A few days ago I switched to a new glasses prescription that has been rather difficult to get used to, and I think this has exacerbated the fatigue a slight bit.", "subreddit": "DiagnoseMe"}

She's caucasian, 5ft 3ins, 73kgs, and her primary complaint is now an altered, unpleasant taste.\n\nThe eardrum itself had become damaged as a result of a low grade, long-lasting infection. As a result of the surgery she was told she suffered damage of her glossopharyngeal nerve, which we believe may be causing her taste problems. She has since been discharged by the treating doctor, being told there's nothing more that can be done. Initially following the surgery, she experienced a metallic taste when eating, and has since changed to an overwhelming salty taste when eating, though seemingly exacerbated by certain foods, such as vinegar, sugars, sand salty snacks?\n\nHer medical history is fairly complex, though broadly speaking, she was born 12 weeks premature, and ever since has had lung troubles (bronchitis, bronchiectasis, chronic Pseudomonas infection, sinus irritation and inflammation (leading to her ear drum dramas?). Her current medications and dosages include Azithramycin (thrice weekly) irbesartin (daily). Mum is a non-smoker, and non-drinker.\n\nAs for treatment she has received up until now, she has received several perineural injection treatments in an attempt to rehabilitate the nerve, but the location of the nerve has made it difficult to target directly.\n\nI would appreciate any information regarding where to go from here.

The increased saliva production goes away after about 3 hours, but the pain lasts for 2-4 days. I've had this my entire life and every doctor I've ever seen about it has been super confused by it. They've confirmed many times that it's not asthma, especially because it doesn't affect my ability to breathe at all. I've been prescribed ventolin just to see if it helps somehow, but it doesn't help at all. And it's really strange that it almost always triggers tonsillitis. The doctors also have no idea why it would make my teeth hurt. The tooth pain is specifically in the bone area just below my lower front teeth (would that be called \"tooth\" pain? idek), and it's a throbbing ache that hurts so bad it brings me to tears. Some doctors suggested I make sure that I'm not clenching my teeth when I run, or try breathing through only my mouth or only my nose, none of which make a difference.\n\nI can obviously live without doing cardio or strenuous activities that get me breathing heavily, but if I ever have to run for the bus or want to exercise with friends or do anything strenuous, I have to be ready to be in a lot of pain and then get tonsillitis.

Then I started to shake it to make the temperature drop. I wanted to retry the measurement because I wasn\u2019t sure if it was properly shaken before. \n\nThe temperature on the thermometer didn\u2019t want to drop so I started to shake it very furiously (i even heard some weird tiny sounds but assumed that it\u2019s ok idk?) and finally after quite a long time it dropped a little but it wasn\u2019t still where I wanted it to be so I just gave up and think nothing of it. \n\nBefore I go sleep I always plug my phone to charge it so I stood up from my bed and went to the desk with the lighter turned on and I noticed that when I move the light there are some tiny tinyy silver dots that shine on the floor just in the place where I was shaking my thermometer. I\u2019m not gonna lie, I kinda panicked and started researching the web about it and I\u2019m scared I inhaled the mercury or something. I checked the temperature at about 8pm and I noticed it at 3 am. I opened up my window and convinced myself that I\u2019m just panicking and went to sleep. Oh, and also it\u2019s worth to note that my feet had contact with it because I walked on the floor without any slippers/socks.\n\nI slept for a few hours and woke up (I guess from anxiety). My right hand (hand that I held the thermometer in and shook it with) feels kinda weird and also I was shaking but it was probably because I was cold due to the opened window so I closed it. I\u2019m a little nauseous and also the muscle in my left calve is twitching. It all may be because I\u2019m anxious, at least I hope so.\n\nIs it possible that my thermometer is leaky and the temperature in it didn\u2019t really drop down but instead some mercury spilled out?
