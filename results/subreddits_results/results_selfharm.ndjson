It was a great conversation, but it brought up a lot of old feelings. \n\nA few days after move in, an old friend that I haven\u2019t talked to in a while but had strong feelings for for a few years, told me she wants to come visit sometime. But I\u2019ve discovered that she\u2019s always been a major trigger for me because of the emotional tension of our relationship. The thought of seeing her after all this time is both super exciting, and extremely anxiety inducing. \n\nI told those friends about her, and they recommend that I cut her out of my life, given that, retrospectively, she was probably a large part of why I started cutting in the first place a couple years ago.

My mental state still yo-yoed like crazy after I had stopped but I haven\u2019t felt the same things that led me to self harm since then. \n\nBut over the past year or so I\u2019ve noticed anger problems I thought I had dealt with starting to get out of hand. I realised I was starting to get violent and if I couldn\u2019t find some kind of outlet for that anger someone was going to get hurt. So I cut myself in the toilets. And I just felt... I dunno, calm? All the anger seemed to bleed out of me and I felt more clear headed than I had in months. \n\nSo for the past few months I\u2019ve been using self harm to keep my anger in check. I hadn\u2019t had to for a few weeks (most of the anger was job related and I got fired sooooo) but I haven\u2019t had anything to smoke today and things started getting too much, so I gave in. \n\nNaturally it worked and I feel totally calm and composed now but that\u2019s the real problem.

My name is D (obviously not my full name but it's enough), and you can call me \"Big D\" (heh) (don't actually call me that, i just made a stupid joke). I do self-harm. I'm not really proud of it, but it's the truth. I'm a guy, if you haven't already understood that by my crude and unfunny humor. I'm also 16, which is an awkward age to be at.  \n\nI really don't like my life. I don't hate it, i just simply don't like it. I don't think i have depression though, because i haven't been to a psychiatrist to get diagnosed, and i don't self-diagnose. I just wanted to vent here, because i can't really vent to my friends in real life (not that i have many of them) because they would either misunderstand me and try to \"help me\" in their own futile way or they wouldn't really care (i only have 2 friends, and that's how each would react respectively). I know this for a fact because a couple of months ago my first friend (let's call him E, like that one meme) saw my fresh scar and almost lost his marbles. \"Oh my god, where did you get that cut?\", \"I can't believe you would do this to yourself\", \"D, we need to seriously talk about your unhealthy behavior\" and other stuff was told to me by E. While my other friend (let's call him A), when he heard of my tendencies to self-harm from E, just shrugged and didn't really give a damn. At his reaction i was initially actually quite relieved, that he wouldn't try to \"help me\" like E did, but then afterwards i was really hurt emotionally because it seemed like he just didn't really give a damn about my well being. Now me being a boy, and quite a dumb one at that, my coping mechanism is to bottle up emotions. \n\nAnd that's the main reason i self harm myself. There are other reasons why i hurt myself. About 3 years ago i moved to a new country. Now I'm not saying that people are slightly racist here where i live (it's in Europe somewhere), but the fact that i only have 2 friends which they themselves don't have many other friend speaks for itself. Let me tell you something about myself. I'm neither extroverted nor introverted. But boy am i charming. My teachers have told me that, my friend's mom has told me that, even random people have told me that at some point at time. I can make girls easily laugh, and i can make friend with almost everyone. I'm also 6ft1 or 186 cm tall . Here where i live I'm taller that the average guy or gal. I'm not thin, nor am i a bodybuilder, and I'm also not fat/overweight. I am on the hefty side though. Back in the country where i used to live, i would have been quite popular actually. But here where i currently live, i am just that guy from that other country. I have only 2 friends, and they aren't exactly the bestest of friends. I don't actually speak to girls that much, only when they need something from me. Teachers actually don't treat me equally to the others in my class, even though they deny it. But i know I'm being treated worse. And i hate it. I hate all of that. I hate the fact that I'm not being treated as a normal person. I hate the fact that people actively avoid me, just because I was born someplace else. I hate that teachers treat other student better than me when they haven't deserved it, and then they actively deny it. And i hate the fact that i can't realistically do anything about it. I hate being out of control of my life. But then i figured out what i can be in control of. I can be in control of my body, and specifically, how much pain it can be in.\n\nNow i know how that last paragraph and a half sounded (especially the last sentence). Bit intense yeah? I can assure you that it's not teenage angst that i have. I'm also not a sociopath or a psychopath or anything of the like. I have thought it through at least a thousand times, and then some. The fact that i bottle up my emotions is the main reason i hurt myself. I don't exactly like the pain, but i also don't hate it. I cut myself. I tried some other methods to help me out, like cigarettes (which was incredibly stupid), working out at the gym (what a surprise, it didn't work), energy drinks (I'm slowly weaning off of them, but i still haven't stopped consuming them), and others that i don't really remember now. But none of them can compare to cutting myself (at least for me). Now, if you aren't actually cutting yourself, good job. Don't do it. I know that i sound like a hypocrite, but i don't care. Don't cut yourself, don't even consider it. I personally don't cut myself now like i used to, it's considerably less. Instead i listen to music and read, like a lot. Or watch movies. Or Youtube. Whatever to take my mind off of my real life struggles. But sometimes it doesn't work, and i end up with a thin red line on my arm the next day. I'm also writing a book, so that's why there are a few ''poetic'' sentences. \n\nAnyways, I'm done with my rant. I'm not gonna cut myself tonight.

(Sometimes when I have a dream like that I get sleeping really deep and my alarm won't wake me up.) I woke up at like 2, and decided it wasn't worth going. It took me about an hour to get out of bed because I was so depressed. I finally went downstairs and got some food, and I really wanted to cut. I'm 2 months clean this week, but I really couldn't help myself. I didn't know what to do, so I went back to sleep, and woke up again at 10pm.

I recently downloaded this app called \"I am sober\" for tracking and helping deal with addiction. It has self-harm as a preset, which is really cool to me because my whole life it's been really invalidated as something in some other category, but it really is an addiction just like any other, and that app is SO helpful. It has you input a bunch of info, including your clean date so you can track your progress, and sometimes it just helps watching the seconds tick by to remind yourself how long it's been and how hard you've worked to get there. It also made me realize things I hadn't even thought about. Like, it asks how much you would usually spend a day on your habit, and at first I thought, \"oh, nothing\" but then I realized how untrue that is. I only bought fresh blades ocassionally, but I still was paying for bandages and clean up supplies and gauze pretty regularly, and so I put in how much I would spend on that in a week and divided it by 7 for the daily cost, and I've probably saved over 100 dollars already. It also tracks how much time you've saved. I put in that I spent about an hour and a half a day on sh, (yes it really was that much time,) and seeing in front of you how much time you've saved for other more productive things is insane. There's a lot more, but it's one of the only good apps I've seen, and they have it for iPhones and androids.

When I'm not I'm staring into space trying to process how I did that to you. \nI really wish I could die. \nThere's so many good reasons why it would benefit others, life insurance would help pay off your debt along with some family's and then some. \nLess problems worrying about where you'll get financially set. You'll have money for school now. And a better car. Maybe a half pay off of a house too. \nI really want to. But I did this to myself. I hurt you. I'm the lowest of the low and I should live with it until I can't anymore.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I've more or less stopped cutting entirely, but the idea of it being fully in the past makes me feel uneasy.  Seeing my scars fade and get obscured by hair makes me feel like I'm losing a part of myself.  The consensus my therapist and I arrived at a few years ago is that putting it in the past means opening up to the prospect of growing up and letting myself be hurt again, which is pretty accurate.  I'll tell concerned strangers that it's something I did as an angsty teenager and that I'm better now, but it doesn't really feel that way.  Like I'll still have really bad weeks where I entertain the idea of cutting again and it feels so comforting even though I know I don't want to go back to relying on self harm as a crutch.

I know that the pe*nis bleeds a lot and is hidden, but there is high risk of infection.  What should I do right now?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I also notice this happens with other kinds of self care, it gets pushed to the side while I try to avoid infection so I don't take care of myself in other ways. But picking gives me the same rush as self harm so I don't think it's just distraction that's responsible. I will continuously dig into something that I know I shouldn't just because it feels good, I feel accomplished if I get rid of every scab/pimple/piece of skin the same way I feel accomplished when I cut deep. Sometimes though it's not enough, and I find myself wanting to take a blade to imperfections on my skin because the feeling when I'm picking reminds me of cutting, but it doesn't feel quite the same. Once I did this to a pimple on my face then kept cutting into it for no reason except I enjoyed the feeling. I'm currently excited because I have a pimple on my leg I didn't find for awhile and it's a perfect excuse for pulling out my blade...urges are really bad right now so I guess I'm looking for a reason to cut but not make a large wound, because I have enough of those from last night. \n\nAlso find it interesting that I started picking my skin when I was about 8. This was 6 years before I first self harmed, but I've always wondered if the picking was a precursor to or served the same purpose as sh. It certainly is the latter right now, not sure if it just evolved into that or it's always been this way. \n\nIdk, just some thoughts I had.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'm a long winded bastard. \n\nContext: I've made two posts here in the past couple weeks, and this may not be my last post, but it will be the conclusion of the two earlier posts of mine. \n\nBackground: The other two posts entirely set up this one and give all the background.\n\nStory: I was clean for nearly a year, until last Friday. The day started off shitty. I slowly got out of bed when all I wanted was to sleep the day away. Before I left my house I grabbed a full razor head, stuck it in my shirt pocket, and left. At this point I was in a good amount of physical and emotional pain that I didn't know how to fix so I went numb on the way to school. When I was finally able to feel it(i.e when I got to school) my anxiety hit me like a freight train. My first period is an online language course so I was able to make an attempt at calming myself down. It sort've worked for a little bit. After that I was with a good friend of mine for two class periods which helped. Unfortunately, I opened my big fucking mouth in that third class, and really hurt his feelings. I don't deal well with upsetting the people I care about. My girlfriend also seemed upset, and I couldn't do anything to help. Couple those things with the anxiety I was already feeling and you have the perfect storm for a relapse. I was able to make it through our break period, but once I got to my last class I couldn't take it anymore. I tried to sleep it off because I take a bus to my last class, but that didn't help. I turned my music up as loud as I could to drown out the voices in my head, and the voices around me. It didn't really work for the voices in my head, but I may have done worse if my anxiety had gone up more from the people around me being loud so that's good. I got to my classroom and strongly debated handing another good friend of mine the razor head because I knew I was so close to losing it. I couldn't bring myself to do it, and when I saw my teacher walking over to start giving assignments that was the straw that broke the camel's back. I rushed out of the classroom to the bathroom and stayed there most of the period. I wanted this pain, this relief so bad that I spent most of that time biting down on the razor head so the casing would break, and I could get a razorblade out. I didn't cut bad, especially compared to my past, but nonetheless I still broke a clean streak and all that jazz. What scared me is that I didn't even feel bad about breaking the streak. I still don't. One of the reasons I stayed clean for so long is because I didn't want to lose that clean run, but if I don't really care then why bother? I dunno, I just wanted to post this as a story to read, and as a small rant since I haven't seen my therapist since last Wednesday. Thanks for reading this post, or the entire trilogy.\n\nP.S If anyone is genuinely worried about me, first of all thank you, but second of all you don't need to be. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist soon to get on meds again, I may be getting a service dog, and I do not have any plans of suicide. Especially if I get a service dog cause then I'll have a girlfriend AND a big floof to live for. The only reason I relapsed was overwhelming depression and anxiety. Honestly both of those have been better since last Friday despite the new anxiety of hiding the cuts. Of course, I'm still trying to stop permanently. But who knows if I'll come back to it again. I forgot how much relief it gives, and I think it'd be better if I reforget that. Anyway, thank you to the people who replied to my previous posts with support and advice. Stay safe friends, and I hope you all have a great day.  \n\nP.S.S Too many post scripts yet? Anyone who read all of this and the trilogy, y'all some real ones.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It turned into a \"it doesn't even need stitches\" or \"it didn't even hit fat so obviously I'm not valid\". \n\nIt got more and more toxic and now I can't NOT hit fat.

I\u2019ve never seen SH as a relationship, but in a way it really can function like one. You\u2019re hurting, SH has your back.

I'm currently a junior in high school, so it's been about six years of self harming on and off. My parents are aware of my problems, and hate that I cut. Like, absolutely hate it. They have tried everything to get me to stop. They've been sweet, they've been strict. My room has been searched more times than I can remember, and when I was in seventh grade I had daily arm, leg, and torso checks to look for self harm. But guess what? I never actually stopped. In fact, the more pressure I felt to stop, the more I ended up hurting myself. \n\nRecently, I've fallen into a deep relapse. However, it's different this time because for once I'm not cutting out of desperation or out of a need to escape my feelings. I'm doing it simply because *I enjoy it.* I really do. It's relaxing and I love it and even when I'm feeling alright, it still gives me a boost. Unfortunately, my parents haven't been seeing this realization, and have still been disappointed about my relapses, which is irritating as fuck. But here's where the story gets good. \n\nI have an incredible therapist. Genuinely the best person I have ever met. Today, for the first time to a person irl, I opened up about my love for self harm. I told her my thought process around it, and how, to me, it's just a daily routine that I have. I don't mind scars and I love cleaning up after it. The entire process makes me feel good. I'll admit, I was scared to tell her about it because I didn't know what she would think. My mom was coming in for a discussion about my SH immediately after my session ended, and I had no clue what my therapist would tell her. I was imagining some scenario of \"Oh hey Momma Legiteretly, your son is fucked in the head and loves to mutilate his body!\" But (and literally I cannot express how much I love my therapist) it went SO WELL. so so so well. My therapist basically summarized her and my conversation, and came up with some suggestions of how my parents can manage my self harm. Basically, my parents are in the loop about my cutting. After today, they know I do it, and I'm not going to hide it. I'm also not going to flaunt it, obviously, but it isn't going to be some big secret. We came up with some rules (no cutting on my arms or in highly visible places; I have to keep things clean; no cutting outside of the house; if things go wrong, like I hit a vein or something looks infected, I have to tell them or my therapist immediately; etc.), but honestly I never thought that I would be able to be this comfortable with my urges. \n\nMy therapist explained that, technically, this does add more pressure to me. I have to be alert of the causes for my self harming. She says it's okay if I'm just doing it to do it, but the second I cut due to intense emotions or anxiety or whatever I have to email her and we need to talk it out. But I am so willing to take that on if it means that I get to do this freely. I feel like for years and years and years I've been so ashamed of my love for self harm, but today I opened up about it and it ended really well. \n\nTL;DR: my therapist and my parents worked together and came up with a way to allow me to cut in a safe and controlled manner", "subreddit": "selfharm"}
{"post_id": "czw976", "created_utc": 1567659368, "title": "My Ex.", "author": "sufffix", "self_text": "Hey. I need some advice.\n\nSo a while ago me and this girl dated for around 3 months. She was amazing but she was also extremely depressed. I remember the time she showed me her SH scars, and that was before I started cutting. I knew that some people did it but I never realized someone who seemed so normal would do it. This, in a way, was one of the reasons I started. \n\nI started cutting about 2 months into our relationship, and this is where the \"she was amazing\" part comes into play. She cut wayy deeper than me, because I, like many people, started cutting very shallow. Still, when she saw my cuts she helped me clean them and talked to me about it, and she still to this day is the only person I've comfortably talked to about SH. \n\nNow. When she broke up with me, she did it in an extremely indecisive and sudden way. She, for the next 3 or so months, in a way teased me. She kept talking about how she missed me and might still get back with me. This was my first relationship so I was naive and thought that would happen. I stayed loyal to her, but then she went and started dating 2 different guys in the span of a few months. She, even while doing this, kept teasing me like she was before. \n\nShe manipulated me into staying loyal to her, and treated me like shit. She got mad at little things I would do and cut me off for a few weeks before crawling back to me, realizing I was one of the only people who could stand her bullshit. I was still oblivious to the fact I was being used, and kept on hoping. \n\nIn June, we got into an argument and cut me off for the entire summer, until yesterday, the first day of school. She came back to me and acted like nothing happened. She lives close to me, so we walked home together. And get this: she had the audacity to call ME an asshole. \n\nI'm not gonna pretend I was the perfect guy to her. I did some selfish things, but she literally used me. She would talk to me for a week, then cut me off for something tiny, then start talking to me again like nothing happened. During the summer, she turned her very few friends against me, to the point of them wanting to beat me up. I have no idea what she told them.\n\nNow. Let's go back to the \"she was amazing\" part. She wasn't really. She did tiny things for me, and sure, she was there for me\" but she was constantly hating me for nothing. I stayed loyal to her while she dated other guys. And funny thing, one time I told her I had a crush on another girl, as she was dating another guy so I thought she'd be okay with it, but she pouted and stopped talking to me for 2 or so days.\n\nMy problem is how in love I am with her. I can't get mad at her. I can't tell her these things outright, and I honestly preferred that she was the one to end it for the summer. Now that she's back I'm worried she'll ruin my life like she did before. \n\nWhat do I do?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

It\u2019s my coping mechanism. It is my body and I am not hurting anyone is the process. So what if I harm myself? Would they rather I bottle it up and end up killing myself? I see how these mental health professionals work. They only want you to stop harming so they can feel pride for themselves, not because they actually want you to stop cutting. But I will tell you what, I am never going be subjected to that. I will not be a prop in someone\u2019s journey to feel better. Why should I stop doing the one thing that holds me together? People don\u2019t care about me enough to actually want to me to stop. The only reason my family want me to stop is because otherwise they feel guilty. My friends may be the only people that genuinely want me to stop. Or perhaps is because they want me to stop needing help and advice from them. I hate feeling so vulnerable, but why shouldn\u2019t I depend on people? I don\u2019t trust the mental health professionals. Most of them lack compassion as they become desensitised. A psychiatrist I had knew I was self harming and had suicidal ideation and what did she do? Nothing! She offered no alternative support! She knew about what led up to my psychotic breakdown and yet she did nothing to help me! She is probably just in the game for the money.

I want to began by saying that I am completely conscious of everything I do, I\u2019ve never been diagnosed of a mental disorder, skin condition, or any neurological issues for that matter. \n\nIt began when I was around 6/7. I would get this extreme tingling sensation on the sides of my tongue (one side at a time) that would itch and cause me to nip at the sides with my teeth. The urge would come and go and there was never any physical warning of its forthcoming; such as bumps, or sores. My tongue looked perfect but this overwhelming urge to bite at the skin was there. One day, after days of biting and nipping small pieces of skin off i began to bleed. This is where most people would\u2019ve stopped. But with a rush of adrenaline the broken skin didn\u2019t cause me pain... but this stinging pleasurable sensation. That deep itch I had screaming for me to keep going. My mind was telling me \u201cif you keep going deep enough you\u2019ll hit \u201cthat spot\u201d and the itch would go away. The more I scratched the more intense it got. \n\nThe first instrument I used was a piece of paper. I took the edge of the paper and slid it across the broken skin on my tongue. I never felt anything like it in my life. The feeling of the sharp paper breaking through my skin was unfathomable and addicting. After about thirty minutes in the mirror I was finished. Looking at myself in disgust. The urge now gone and all that\u2019s left was a bloody mess. I cleaned everything and pretended it didn\u2019t happen. Although this happened countless times after I never figured out how to tell anyone. A couple years passed and the urge increased along with my pain tolerance. I stopped using paper and began using nail clippers that I bought and sterilized just for this. I wanted to know what it felt like to go as deep as I could. The first few times It was much too painful and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to really do much. But eventually the urge was too much. I would clip so my skin off one spot on my tongue it would be a bloody mess. I at times go into a moment of shock I guess you could call it. Where I wouldn\u2019t feel anymore pain and would keep going and going. My tongue would have a dark hole from all the picking. I would never reach \u201cthat spot\u201d (because there isn\u2019t one). But the feeling was again too much to ignore. And just like before after each time doing this the urge would subdue until I healed and it worked it\u2019s way back up. \n\nFast forward to my teenage years and my tongue issue is still there. I pick, it heals, it repeats. I\u2019m 13 at this and I wake up with the same feeling on my palm, left middle finger right between the knuckle. What began as scratching turned into skin peeling. And I quickly realized I had the same urge and sensation in this particular spot. I pick the skin so much and so often in that one spot I can barely close my hand at times. \n\nI\u2019m 24 now and there are 4 areas in total where from the moment I wake up until I go to sleep I have the urge to pick, peel, cut, and scratch. If I ignore it it becomes the only thing I can think about. If I do it I feel a stinging pleasure that is hard to describe but so intense it\u2019s addicting to the point where it causes me to continue until I cannot induce more pain. The only way to stop the urge is to give into it. Once I do it I\u2019ll have at least until it heals before it\u2019s 100% back. But it never completely goes away. Even as I type I can feel in each area a warm throbbing, a urge to scratch, squeeze or apply some kind of pressure to get that particular feelings. \n\nBefore suggesting some help I would like you to know that I\u2019m well-versed on common treatments and causes for skin-picking. Anti depressants have not helped me.. I do not have anxiety, I\u2019m not stressed aside from dealing with this. This is not stressed induced. There are no triggers. I am not trying to fix imperfections in my skin as my skin is otherwise clear. I do not have acne or eczema. I wake and the urge is there in each spot and no where else.. when I eat, shower, drive, all day 24/7. If I ignore it it intensifies. When I\u2019m busy the urge isn\u2019t as strong but still there unless I\u2019ve ignored it for hours already. I hope before suggesting something for me you take this information into consideration \n\nLastly, I do want help but it seems I\u2019m living a life where I\u2019ll literally never be comfortable in my own skin. I have frequent thoughts of taking a knife and cutting off those areas completely in hopes that if they are gone then so is the urge, but I couldn\u2019t take something like that. At this point I\u2019m beginning to think the only thing I can do is get multiple minor surgeries/amputations. But each doctor I\u2019ve done too either cannot help or want me on some anti depressant. If anyone has anything that they think would help my situation I would really appreciate it. I don\u2019t want to live the rest of my life with this.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I haven't self harmed since February and have no intention of ever doing so ever again. I just wanted to vent a little, and maybe see if others experienced something like this.\n\nI first started self harming a few weeks before the start of senior year. The year prior to that had been an absolute shit show for me and the though of going back to school honestly made me want to kill myself.\n\nSo I started cutting. \n\nIt was little cuts at first, most didn't even bleed. I cut a whole bunch at once and then when it was over I felt really bad about it and didn't plan on doing it again.\n\nFlash forward to the start of school. I had zero friends, until I meet this girl in one of my art classes. She seemed really cool and we got along really well. We became fast friends. We got really close. I was closer to her than anyone else in my life. Eventually we're sitting down at my house and my shorts ride up and she sees my cuts. I know she sees them. She knows I know she sees them.\n\nSo she pulls up her shirt sleeve and shows me her arm, and it's *covered* in scars. Big, small, red, white, all kinds, all up and down her arm. She tells me that it's okay that I cut because she does it too. \n\nMaybe I would have stopped on my own if this hadn't happened, maybe not. But the validation she gave me then and continued to give over the course of our \"friendship,\" caused me to spiral so out of control. Things were one hundred times worse because of her being in my life. It wasn't until after she left that I was finally able to stop.\n\nAnyways. That's my story.

I\u2019m a 20 year old, ftm, binary trans guy. I\u2019ve been on T 5 months and am enjoying most of the experience (as far as changes go I\u2019m enjoying it at least, not really loving the emotional aspect of shit but that\u2019s just how puberty is, and hormones essentially trigger a second puberty). I am looking into top surgery and have got a surgeon picked. I am confident in who I am. SH is a coping skill I picked up at a young age (11) to deal with my then-unnamed and unidentified gender dysphoria. It\u2019s pretty much what i resort to, besides sobbing and panicking until I fall asleep, which isn\u2019t really much more pleasant. \n\nMy papa was on his way back to their place to help me work on my car (that\u2019s why I went up), and while I was waiting on him, my memaw decided that would be a fantastic time to give me the official, full on, \u201cyou\u2019re a horrible sinner, you\u2019re going to hell\u201d talk. We\u2019ve had 2-3 30 second spats about it, but she never got the chance to go at me like this. My mom is always up there when I am, and defends me. She dashed in the \u201cyour sin is no worse than mine\u201d seasoning, of course, but it was pretty much just a shame fest. She also drug my mom and little sister into it, saying I was damaging their souls by causing them to sin when they call me my preferred name and yanno... love and accept me for who I am, and respect my wishes to not be called a name and pronouns that inflict emotional damage upon me. She also used this as her justification for not using my name or pronouns or accepting me (that it\u2019s a sin for her to do such). I told her it was hurtful to hear those names and pronouns, to which she of course responded \u201coh, it\u2019s all about you isn\u2019t it? Poor pitiful (deadname)\u201d. Well yes, it fucking is about me, for the first time in 19 years. They\u2019re my emotions. I should want to fucking protect them. Don\u2019t make me feel like shit for not wanting to be made to feel like SHIT. Fuck your god if he wants you to make me miserable. I don\u2019t care what you say or how severely you were indoctrinated, the pain you feel when you \u201csin\u201d is absolutely incomparable to the pain I feel when I\u2019m misgendered and deadnamed repeatedly. \n\nShe also gave me the 3rd degree about why I waited so long to come out if I was really trans. Says she would have known. No. You fucking wouldn\u2019t have. You did not live in my body and in my brain and feel my emotions, or experience my life first hand. You cannot possibly know what the fuck I went through. You don\u2019t know me better than me. Not to even fucking mention there were lowkey signs (I cut my hair short, I dressed butch/tomboyish, i had a very typical \u201cmetal bro\u201d persona despite being technically not a bro, I had no female friends and found the men much easier to socialise with and more relatable, I always talked about having a reduction at the very least because my chest has always made me uncomf, and more, but those are just external things). I had even told my mom at 14 I thought I may be trans. I got scared because I was a kid still and far worse a people pleaser than I am now, and let it be forgotten, but it was always there, tucked away, nagging at me. \n\nShe tried to use my last ditch effort at femininity against me, too. I had a repression phase, sure. Many, many trans people do have a repression phase. I presented extremely fem for maybe a year, year and a half, probably from ages 17-18.5. It was my final attempt to make the assigned gender fit (spoiler: it doesn\u2019t fit) before I finally cut all my hair off (again, I cut and kept it short when I was younger prior to this repression phase) and started experimenting more with gender. And I tried hard. That phase nearly killed me though, literally, as it ended in me attempting suicide. I had previously bound my chest a few times (maybe 7 total) from 14-17 before I got to that repression phase. I started doing it more after the attempt, and slowly came to accept myself. Even the year from like 18-19 where I was slowly working my way into accepting myself was difficult in an entirely new way because I was like, aware and accepting that I was trans, but felt like I would never be able to do anything about it or come out, because I was still more worried about making other people happy than making me happy. \n\nThis sort of talk was truly what kept me in the closet for 19 years, until I tried to hang myself from it, and the universe literally handed me a pair of boxers as a wake up call (i actually did try to hang myself in a closet, that\u2019s the aforementioned suicide attempt, and at the psych place, they didn\u2019t have fem underwear and gave me boxers). The fear of facing this kept me trapped for years. And while I\u2019m now out and giving much less of a fuck, deep down, I\u2019m still a people pleaser who wants everyone to like me and view me as someone worthy of their respect. I\u2019m not a Christian, haven\u2019t been since I was 16, so I\u2019m not actually worried about hell or my sins... I just fucking hate to hear the non acceptance and the questioning of my gender, the gender I have already thoroughly, amongst 20 years, questioned myself to painful extents. It\u2019s not fun. It hurts. Plus the amount of times I heard \u201c(deadname)\u201d, \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher\u201d in reference to myself today was... a bit fucking much. I don\u2019t understand how you can put religion ahead of consideration for your grandsons wellbeing, and I never fucking will. \n\nSo it was big yeet time when I got home. I only fucked up like, the upper 1/4 of the thigh I had left (boxers cover down to about 1/2 the thigh so I try not to go too low, other thigh was all filled up and the rest of this one is still a little too freshly messed with to go over again yet, or I\u2019d probably have gone further). I\u2019m not even mad at myself about it. I was for like 30 minutes, sitting there like \u201cu/infinityonfuckyou you fucking dumbass\u201d but nah. Nah. I\u2019m mad at her for pushing me like this. I understand they\u2019re my feelings and actions, gotta take responsibility for them, but I did not act alone and certainly didn\u2019t pull the bad feelings out of my bad feeling closet and put them on. Have I done that before? Absolutely. But not this time. I could have employed better coping mechanisms, but she shouldn\u2019t have made me so upset I had to cope with these fucking thoughts and feelings of shame in the first place. \n\nAll in the name of God too. What fucking bullshit. Despite not being a Christian, I still know that\u2019s not what God\u2019s about. There\u2019s absolutely nothing against being transgender in the bible. Nada. Zilch. Zero. I asked her to show me where and she told me to read Romans\u2019 and corinthians and I\u2019d find the answer. I told her \u201cif you want to make that arguement, that\u2019s fine, but take responsibility for it. I should not have to research your argument and find the information your claiming exists by myself\u201d. She got big, BIG mad then and stormed off, saying \u201chave a nice life\u201d. That was the end of our conversation. Papa got there soon and we did our shit. Didn\u2019t mention it to him. He\u2019s very religious as well, and won\u2019t use the right pronouns, but will use my name because it \u201ccan be a girls name\u201d (it\u2019s Samuel, shortened to Sam, my mom picked it out for me). But he doesn\u2019t have the shame talks like memaw does. \n\nBut hey. Got my fucking car all fixed and bandaged up, even if my legs currently need steri strips.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Self-harm has really consumed my life at this point since alcohol and self-inflicted pains are my only ways out to distract myself from the toxic environment that I live in.

I quitted for a week, but one evening I got too fed up with my emotions I relapsed hard. Ever since that day I've been cutting 3-7 times per day. I ask to go to the bathroom at school and most of the time I don't even go for hygienic reasons. My main cutting areas are my breasts. I find it really easy to cut there since nobody is going to see them anytime soon. Since I'm a d cup, so it's literally the best place to cut. I hate wearing crop tops or any sort of see-through or revealing clothes due to my diagnosed body dysmorphia; last Thursday it was 90-degree weather and I refused to take off the hoodie of which is part of school uniform. I don't like to cut on my arms because my parents are extremely controlling and would get suspicious of me wearing long sleeve smack dab in the middle of summer. My cuts aren't small anymore. They're really deep that my entire chest and stomach get covered in blood, so much that I regularly take showers to clean the blood off and to avoid the blood staining fabric. \n\nI haven't gone to therapy in months and I really need someone to vent to about this. I want to tell my therapist so I can stop for sure- but she'll tell my parents. My parents finding out that I've been cutting for years is the last thing I want to happen. So for now, I'm stuck. I have friends, but we all self-harm. We give each other tips on how to hide them and such. I gave my friend two ultra-sharp blades that work WONDERS, and in return, she gives me two cigarettes. My other friend buys me blades and such. She gave me this bracelet with a pocket in which you can take your blades to go. I currently only have 13 blades left, which concerns me.

It\u2019s just comments that get me I guess. I had made myself throw up just last week over a weight loss comment my stepdad made. I haven\u2019t cut myself since April but idk how that\u2019s gonna go over the next 24 hours. Hell, I even wanted to cut earlier today before anything had even happened because there was broken glass near me. I just wanted to make myself bleed. I like seeing myself bleed and I don\u2019t understand it. I will say that the running comment is the number one reason I won\u2019t go to the gym. I feel like everyone will make those comments to me.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

(vent i guess)", "author": "letslonely", "self_text": "i cant sleep because my partner stopped responding 2 hours ago. they werent doing well tonight but didnt let me come over, and the last time they didnt send me a good night text a couple weeks back, they'd relapsed. im so scared but i cant know til i see them tomorrow if anything happened. i really hope they just fell asleep on me but they usually text goodnight to me when they get out of bed to turn out the lights and they wouldnt sleep with the lights on. they just got out of psych inpatient early, the day before yesterday, thanks to what seemed to be a very benefical medication change. they seemed so happy and optimistic about how much better they felt these past few days. the new medicine wears off over the course of the day and they started feeling very anxious and more down after i went home. im scared if they relapsed tonight they'll keep doing it night after night and/or go back to being suicidal because they believe the new meds aren't doing enough to keep them stable. i just want them to be okay.\n\ni don't feel like i can tell them, they have enough to worry about, but i'm really struggling too. i told them whenever i had urges before my partner's last relapse since theyd been clean almost 2 months before it, but since their last one happened i've kept quiet. i'm pretty confident my talking about it openly is part of why they relapsed so now i keep it to myself. i dont know how much longer i can deal with the constant stress every night lying awake terrified that they're going to have fresh wounds next time i see them, or that theyll tell me again they almost drove off a bridge. my anxiety is running higher than it has in years, since the last time i dated someone who self harmed. my therapist said i should avoid people with self harm problems but ive never dated someone who didnt have them and with being lgbt, its way too common to just avoid. \n\ni'm 5 weeks clean. i want to relapse so fucking badly too but i feel like that would totally doom our relationship and my partner is so precious to me, i can't lose them. i know if i brought up these fears they'd say they wouldnt leave me. but i dont want the wonderful bond we have to be lost to shitty unhealthy habits and for us to have to break up for our own individual health. i've had 2 exes where i got in a loop of self harm with them, where one person relapsing both triggered and made it \"okay\" to self harm for the other person. i love my partner too much, i refuse to let that happen. i refuse to make their mental health worse. so i've not given in to my urges.\n\nif i can just keep up this clean streak long enough, maybe they can get through the rough patch life has thrown at them and go back to months of being clean too. this is the first time in 8 years of SH that i've ever actually fought the desire to hurt myself with all my might like this instead of giving in almost immediatley, and it's been horrible. ive been getting urges every day, multiple times, for weeks. even away from home when i have no blades, i never feel truly safe from myself. if i'm just holding anything hard in my hand, from a pencil to a lighter to a fork, my impulse is to hit the shit outta my leg and make some nice bruises. id be asleep by now if i'd relapsed. id feel okay enough to relax even though im worried about my partner. i miss it so much.\n\nand, i feel horrible for thinking this, but if i gave in, my partner would give me more attention when they saw what i did to myself. their undivided attention has been so scarce lately. i know theyre going through a whole lot, and ive always been the more affectionate needy one, but when we spend time together i dont feel like they hardly ever focus on me quite like they used to. i dont feel like i can bring that up either because its honestly not their fault and they shouldn't feel bad for it. but i feel awful, though i know they love me, i wish they would be more expressive about it. i just want to feel truly beloved and precious to them again. these past few weeks, every day while i'm with them, i spend a lot of our time together trying to calm them down or get them out of the dark parts of their head. i'm giving them all the support theyll let me give, trying to keep them stable, and it's exhausting, makes me sad, and sometimes doesnt even work. oh, and we havent had sex in weeks. which sucks. \n\ni love them so much and aside from their recent struggles they're an amazing partner. the best i've ever had, they've never lied to me or hurt me and i dont think they ever will. unlike my past mentally ill partners, they're actually getting treatment and working on getting better. they're amazing at communicating, can sometimes even seem to read my mind, and they're kind and good towards everyone. we like the same music, the same political causes, the same fashion, we're even both nonbinary and understand each other's gender struggles. before their mental health suddenly declined maybe 3 weeks ago, i adored every minute i spent with them. now i still love their good moments, and i want to stick by them in hopes that we can go back to those being the majority. \n\nit seemed like their new meds really helped for most of the day and it was like i'd gotten the person i fell in love with back again for a while, but before they drove me home to head to dinner with their mom, their anxiety had gotten bad again. if they relapsed tonight i dont know if they'll have the same positive attitude about this new medication. i'm not sure how long i can keep this up but god damn it i'm going to try with my whole fucking soul to get through this and stay strong for them. if they can find a way to be stable, i know we can be happy. \n\ni doubt anyone will bother reading so much text in a sub where theres so many posts like this but i'd love if you could a comment saying if you did. im gonna go get drunk and stoned and see if that helps me sleep.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I always physically punished myself whenever I did something wrong. When I was 8 and my parents got mad at me, I hit my head repeatedly against a wall to make up for it. When I was 12 I began to starve myself because I thought I didn\u2019t deserve to eat. I started scratching at myself when I was 13. I asked my boyfriend to punch me when I made him mad. Now I\u2019m 19 and my automatic response to guilt/shame is taking the nearest sharp object and slashing my left wrist.\n\nI made my roommate/friends angry this past weekend because I was drinking and smoking despite claiming I was going sober. I relapsed, it got out of hand, and I was wasted. The smell of weed from my room gave my other roommate a severe panic attack, even though I genuinely thought the smell wouldn\u2019t escape. I hurt my friends severely and it\u2019s the worst decision I ever made. I can\u2019t stop slashing at myself. Today I tried to apologize and instinctively started crying, and one of them said \u201cStop trying to make us feel bad for you, stop playing the victim.\u201d As soon as I walked out the door with my keys in my hand, I cut my wrist vertically. I pushed my keys as hard as I could into my skin while I heard them talk about how dramatic I am behind the door.\n\nWhy is this my first response to everything? Why can\u2019t I stop punishing myself? I just want to apologize to my friends, they have every right to be angry, I just want them to know that I\u2019m sorry and remorseful.

You will find the blood and pain release addictive. Even though you think you can make a few tiny cuts that aren't deep and will heal easily, they will get deeper. They will scar. They will take sometimes months to heal. And years for the scars to fade. If you think you can limit the cutting to one area of your body, think again; it will spread when you run out of skin.\n\n\n\"Be prepared for your entire life to revolve around thinking about cutting, cutting and covering up cutting. And just wait till that first time you cut \"too deep.\" And you freak out because the blood won't stop, and you are gaping, and you feel yourself shaking all over. You are having a panic attack and you are terrified but you can't tell anyone. So you sit there alone, praying it will be ok swearing you'll never let it go this far again. But you will, and further.\n\n\"Don't worry, you will learn how to take care of your cuts so that you can go deeper and deeper and avoid the ER. And the better you get at treating your cuts, the deeper they get. You will lie to yourself and justify it when you find yourself spending 20, 30 or 50 dollars every time you go the pharmacy. You will feel the flutter of your heartbeat every time you go to the counter to ring up your order. Butterfly strips, 3 or four different kinds of dressings, Betadine, antibiotic cream, medical tape, scar reducers. You will tap your foot impatiently, hoping the line will just move and no one will stare at you or wonder why you need all these things. And at the same time, secretly hope someone will notice; someone who is standing in line with an armful of the same supplies; someone who understands but of course that never happens.\n\n\"You will always have to wash your laundry in private so know one sees the blood stains on your clothes and towels. You will always be cleaning up the blood, scrubbing your bathroom floor, wiping the blood off your keyboard. You won't be able to make it through a day without cutting.\n\n\" When you get really desperate anything will be a cutting tool; scissors, a car key, a needle, a paperclip, even a pen. Doesn't matter what it is if you need to cut badly enough, you will find something.\n\n\"Say goodbye to things you took for granted. Like wearing shorts or sandals, pedicures, sleeveless tops. A normal summer day at the beach or in a swimming pool will become a far off memory for you. Get ready to itch. Because you will itch and itch, \"so much you will look like you have fleas or a skin disease.\" You will become an expert on your body as you destroy it carefully. You will dream about cutting, you will dream about being exposed. It will haunt you day and night and take over your life. You will wish you never made that first cut because while you absolutely HATE cutting at the same time you love it and can not live with out it...\"\n\n- Anonymous", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Today is day one of recovery (after relapse) and I hope to make it a year. \nShould something happen and I\u2019m not doing so good and give into the urges I can almost guarantee I\u2019ll be back on here because y\u2019all have been so supportive and have been the only support system I\u2019ve had. y\u2019all understand somewhat what I\u2019m feeling and I really appreciate every one that has offered advice and have listened to me whine. I appreciate you all so much. Much love. \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Overall, the past two years have not gone great, and this year I don't have a single friend at my school. I finally worked up the courage to dress how I want but now no one will make eye contact with me and people refuse to talk to me. I try consistently to be kind and helpful to people and every single time it gets thrown back in my face by people pretending I'm not there, or miming shooting themselves in the head because they have to interact with me. The last two weeks I've had sobbing and cutting sessions on the floor of my bathroom because I can't take this and I just feel like there's no one who I can relate to. I look around my school of over 1600 kids and I can't find one person who looks like me, or talks like me. I feel so isolated and even though I've been 3 months clean it all came crashing down because I feel like everyone hates me and no one even reaches out. I've barely handled two weeks of this I don't know if I can take 9 more months. I want to transfer out of my school and go to where my best friend goes but this school has better academics so it's not even an option to my family, even if I feel like killing myself everytime I have to walk in there.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I haven\u2019t relapsed with cutting, but I\u2019m feeling guilty because I\u2019ve started picking and scratching at the skin around my nails when I\u2019m anxious, sometimes drawing blood. I even dug into my palm with a pen today. I try to tell myself it\u2019s not self harm because lots of people bite and pick at their nails, but in reality I\u2019m doing it for the same reason I used to cut.

I don\u2019t mind any other time, but this is at nursing school while working with patients and health care professionals. They\u2019re noticeable, they\u2019re wide and have no pigment so they\u2019re white and stand out. I get hot easily so I often have my sleeves rolled up. My patient noticed today and said something. I am sure my friends at school and teachers have noticed too and I hate it. \n\nI was hoping someone had some tips to cover up old scars like these with makeup? I put on five layers of foundation, trying to buildup and get the color on the scars but it didn\u2019t work. I may see if putting a contour darker shade first will help. \nThanks.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I'm probably overthinking this way too much as I usually do. First off the story. So I've been self harming for years now (about 6 or 7) and recently met this fantastic and caring doctor. He already noticed how nervous I am due to my constant trembling when in a stressfull and unknown situation. He offered me the choice to get help and also assured me that I can talk to him.\n\nWell that was half a year ago and of course I never went back there because only a mentally stable person would do such an atrocious thing! But I never stopped thinking about it. He doesn't know anything about the self harm but I would love to talk to him again because I feel like I can really trust him. He was so professional, kind, observant and took the situation seriously.\n\nBut here's the thing. I know that he's \"just\" an physician and I would need to speak to a psychiatrist or someone working in the mental health field. But I'm certain that I'm not ready for that kind of help. Which makes seeing my doctor pretty pointless if I'm not accepting further help. Of course I could still ask him about scar reduction etc. It would be weird and dumb to just show up for a bit of chit chat, wouldn't it?

I never cut very deep (my hands would always shake and I never had the courage or whatever to go deep) and it was always in this square area of skin on my inner arm so that no one could really see (I wore long sleeves 95% of the time anyway). One girl on my debate team saw them once in school and confronted me about it, didn't believe the excuse I gave. I told her that I didn't want to die and I never cut enough to bleed much and she never told anyone about it. Some of my friends might have suspected but I'm not sure.\n\nI graduated about 4 years ago now and the last few months have been hard on me. My anxiety has been through the roof and I can feel my depression creeping up on me. Things have been tense with family and my roommate and I are always fighting, to the point that our 10 year long friendship is done for.\n\nAnd a few weeks ago at work we got new box knives in, along with a few packages of replacement blades. I don't know what made me do it, but I picked up one of the packages of blades and took it home. \n\nIt sat in my nightstand for a week or so, and I kept thinking about it. Then one day I took one of the blades from the case and took it to my arm, in the same spot I used to. I cut that square of skin to near ribbons, but still not too deep. I covered it with a bandage and went on. They healed for the most part in a few days. Once it did, I got the urge again. This time though I wanted to be able to hide them at work easier so I did my thigh. Only a few cuts that first time. It amazed me how much easier it was to get the cuts to bleed there. They're taking a bit longer to heal too, although I didn't cut very deep with them either (I still think a few might scar though) Last night I cut my thigh even more. About half of the side of my thigh is covered in scratches and cuts, more than I've ever done. \n\nBut I feel satisfied. I know it shouldn't feel ok, I know it's a bad thing to do, but since I started doing it again I feel... Liberated?

{"post_id": "d3gunp", "created_utc": 1568333160, "title": "Post of Obligation", "author": "meryn_scouter", "self_text": "Hello strangers! My brother made me promise to him that i would tell someone about my self harm after he found out that i had started self destructive behavior again so i decided to post it on here so that the least amount of people would notice as possible so i wouldn't be as humiliating. \n\nSo i have a relatively long history with self harm although it has never been serious imo and after having been close family to two sibling who has done serious self harm my little scratches seem insignificant. The reason i have only been scratching is because first i liked the little sting it gave me but then one time when i finally went deep enough to actually draw blood i was enchanted and i felt this overwhelming sense of calmness and a feeling that everything was right in the world and that i was in control, after that i would try to draw blood with as little as pain as possible to just get that feeling back. After a while i stopped because the feeling had sort of worn off and the risks of getting caught with these puny marks was too humiliating, and so after about half a year had gone i noticed the tiny scaring it had given me and i was again enchanted and i got that feeling that i had so many years ago and i realized that i could create such bigger and such more beautiful marks if i had the courage to go deeper. And after a particularly bad week i began again to see what results it would yield. I am unfortunately a coward so i never managed to go deeper than like a centimeter because of the pain and i just started to get disappointed instead of feeling a sense of relief and calmness when i could only go so far and i still felt so very silly to make such small marks when my siblings had done so much worse and i just felt like a failure, like i couldn't even harm myself properly. And so i stopped but my mental health gradually got worse and worse and after a few months i looked at the scars again and i just felt like i was ready now, i was fucked up enough mentally for this to be justified and that maybe i could go deeper this time.\n\nAnd so i started first scratching again and it evolved into scratching with a box cutter, to drawing blood again, and finally splitting the first layer of the skin and i felt that same rush of pride, control and feeling of being safe again and i knew that this time i couldn't get caught because i just loved doing it so damn much and it was a break i really needed from my terrible mental state. That same day i still had left those scratching marks on my wrist but it was summer and i just thought people would assume it was a mosquito bite and so i only wore a tee. This i realized later was a mistake after my brother who is quite familiar with self harm knew where those marks where from and confronted me and made me promise to tell someone after i had done anything like that no matter how small. I really didn't feel like sharing something so personal to me that i knew, and still know that most likely not a lot of people will understand, so i took a break almost a week i think before my mental health had deteriorated even further and i felt like the only thing that could make me feel whole again was the cutting. So i started again after having bought another method of cutting which i knew would hurt less and cause more damage started again, small at first so as not to scare me into stopping and then it sort of escalated quickly and now i am actually doing flesh wound for the first time i think and i feel so... complete like this is how i am supposed to be and this is the only way for me to be truly happy for now even if it is only for a few minutes it still feels so, so good and i love it so much. I know i'm supposed to feel guilty knowing that eventually my family will find out and they'll probably be upset but i just... don't care it feels so right and i don't want anyone to take that away from me and after all the things i feel on a regular basis i just feel like i need that break to survive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really sorry if i upset anyone, because i know that i'm treating it lightly and i know it isn't like that for most of you, i know it is something of an addiction and something horrifying that many people have to go through and i don't mean to disrespect any of that i just wanted to actually explain myself if i had to share what i had done in at least an attempt to make people understand, even though i know that this will most likely upset some of you and for that i am truly sorry.\n\nTl;dr: cutting again and it's more serious than before although relatively harmless", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I am now 20. I quit for a year, from around August 2018 to my relapse at the end of this August. I thought I had washed my hands of this, finally. That was the longest I\u2019d ever had. \n\nSince I started 9 years ago, I had it in my head I\u2019d be dead by 20. I tried several times to make that reality. Until I hit 20, and when I hit 20, I was doing fine mental health wise. It felt surreal, to hit the age i never thought I would, and be okay with it. \n\nBut now I\u2019ve relapsed, and since then, I\u2019ve stared to feel like I\u2019m going to be dead by 30. My 20\u2019s are going to be my new teens. Full of self harm, because obviously I\u2019m incapable of leaving that behind, which is going to eventually turn into me being suicidal constantly. I\u2019m not exactly suicidal right now, but it\u2019s crossed my mind more often than usual recently. I can feel the spiral coming. And I\u2019m dreading it. But there\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve ever been able to do to stop it, I doubt that\u2019s different now. I\u2019m just eventually going to kill myself, and there\u2019s nothing I can really do to stop it. Even if 30 isn\u2019t as far as I go, I know eventually, one of these days, I\u2019m gonna do it. \n\nI don\u2019t want psych medication. For one, I can\u2019t really remember to take them. I\u2019ve never been good at taking pills. For another, even when I am able to remember them, they don\u2019t really do shit all. I\u2019ve been on at least 20, as many as 30 different medications, and none of them ever really worked enough for me to make a full recovery. It was always partial. I\u2019m so fucking sick of partial recoveries. My last clean streak wasn\u2019t meds, just sheer fucking willpower. And I\u2019m all out of willpower again. \n\nIt\u2019s also a lot harder to get approval for any of the surgeries I need if you have any kind of active mental health diagnosis (which is ironic, because the reason I need them is the reason my mental health is such fucking shit). I don\u2019t have any, just a history and \u201cin remissions\u201d, because as far as any doctors know, I\u2019m perfectly fine. \n\nI just feel stuck, and hopeless for any kind of brighter future where I\u2019m not a massive fuck up.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I use bandaids on my wrist because the one on my palm isn't noticable neither is the one on my thigh. But the problem is that they fall off when I sweat or wash my hands. They are \"waterproof\" bandaids. And they are the most quality bandaids I can buy. I spend 3 euros on them and there is only 10 of them inside. There are 6 small ones and 4 big ones. I only use big ones because the small ones are... too small. In PE class I sweat and the bandaids falls off. Last time I went to the bathroom while covering my wrist because it fell off. I spent about 10 minutes crying because I didn't have any more bandaids. I lied to the teacher and said I was sick. I   tried to stop cutting.

I get found by the one teacher I give a shit about, then am in the lesson next for the one I respect the most.

It's just not me. And one thing leads to another and suddenly I'm telling my girlfriend about me being suicidal and the note and close calls. So, I'm panicking and go get the bus without a response.

Which I didn\u2019t cry but I swear something in me today just fucking melted like I just suddenly felt sadness almost like grief, and hurt, and then felt like a stupid child for getting so hurt by stupid crap like that, and then I ended up using one of my tiny razors to cut myself a few times on the area of my arms that I could cover with sleeves because I suddenly felt that I should be hurt for being so stupid (but then I actually think a part of it was because some part of me absorbed/agreed with the judgement from the people I talked with which is even fucking worse), then I bit myself and scratched myself really hard a few times because it\u2019s painful but not enough to be more uncomfortable than not.

So I would understand if this post would get tons of downvotes or would get removed and I don't even expect anything more than that. And I'd totally understand if I'd get called a cringy teenager and a total pathetic idiot.\n\n\nSo. I'm all the time feeling about myself like about a failure. I grew up with my parents always saying \"do you even actually need that?\" whenever I came up with any idea. They always told me \"you'll change your mind soon\" whenever I told them about any plans for any future farther than a months away. Whenever I did a mistake they blamed me for doing it, but when I asked for help all what I could get was or telling me the solution without explaining how it works or just sitting with me, asking me how to solve it. Sometimes instead of almost blank \"good job\" I would get a \"and why are you not always like this?\" whenever I'd succeed in something. I always was told that I have to be strong, I have to hold my tears, go through anything, I gotta man up. Every time I got in trouble it was my fault for them, to point when I once got beaten up because I didn't googled a thing for them in a minute because I was busy. And now I can see effects of that parenting with my sensitiveness.\n\nWhen I told my parents that I felt too pressured and they blamed me too much they blamed me for blaming them, yelled at me until I left in tears. Several times. One time I heard them saying that they think I'd become addicted to drugs and a serial killer if they'd stop keeping an eye on me and when I told them that it was too much they cornered me, started asking tons of questions, blaming me for things, and when on their question about what do they have to do to help me I answered they they should not ask thousands of questions asking me to give them literal instructions for everything, they still continued pressuring me with questions in a corner. \n\nThey tell me that they love me, while all I get is a blank \"how are you?\" once per several weeks, guilt for any mistake, the only support in face of paying for my food and bills, and never even trying to start even a little talk, they're or rarely telling about themselves or talking about money/school stuff. They don't know about my self harm, they don't know that I tell myself to suicide several times per week, they won't even allow me to change my name because I hate one they gave me so I have to wait for a bit till I'll turn 16 and even then I doubt they'd call me by my changed name. They openly decided to not call me by name that I want even after a psychologist told them to, yelling \"but I called you \u2014!\". They didn't even care about me literally not talking to them except for texting at all for months and never even considered that I'm not talking to them because they've done something wrong so they should apologise, even after I texted them that several times. They're against my sexuality, against the fact that I want to move to my bf when I'll turn 18 and even hope I'll change my mind about that. And I highly doubt they've ever thought they have ever done anything wrong to me at all.\n\nNow I can't even call them bad parents cause I feel judged if I do that. I tell myself that I'm a pathetic being every day, telling how I don't deserve to be alive, how I should suffer and cut my arm into blood every day, how I'll never succeed in life, never achieve any goals and will just die from suicide maximum at age of around 20, without a job, education, love, or any support. I imagine me yelling at myself, telling how horrible I am and what bad things I deserve and should do to myself. And how can anyone expect me to not do that? I'm just hopeless, stupid, lazy, pathetic, useless being. I don't deserve a life. What's the point of living anyways? I would do world a favor if I'd kill myself, I wouldn't waste precious oxygen.\n\nBut no matter what, I don't think I need any help, I'm fine. I'm just weak and stupid. I bet I can't even actually kill myself, I'm too pathetic. So I'm ok, I'm just a cringy teenager, right? It's just a phase, isn't it? People actually having problems out there, so I shouldn't fake that I need any help. Who would care if I'd hurt myself too much anyway?\n\n\nTl;Dr: my parents used to push me a bit too hard so now I'm telling myself to cut and that I should die every day.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I would wear my watch with the face the wrong way to try and cover it up, but that would slip up my arm and show it off anyway.

It was the first time I was ever hospitalized. I had just broken things off with my ex the day before our 1 and a half year anniversary(September 9th). I had found texts between him and my best friend about them sending nudes and making plans to \"meet\" up. I was devastated and on top of it, he pinned it all on me. Everything was my fault and that I \"practically gave him no other choice but to cheat\". I felt that if all my love still wasn't enough for him, it wasn't ever going to be enough for anyone else. So I took a shit ton of pills and was ready to die. \n\nThen my friend I was staying with(now boyfriend:D) came into my room to see me unresponsive and called 911. I dont remember much after I took the pills, especially that day and the following day in the hospital. I was transported to a mental hospital after I was deemed stable. \n\nThe hospital isnt much to talk about, nonstop groups, horrible food, people screaming at night. I didnt sleep much the entire week I was there. I was just in limbo.\n\nAfter I got out, I was under constant supervision(as I was 17) but I still self harmed. I'm not sure what changed, but in December, I cut for the final time. So I've been clean for 10 months as of September 13th.\n\nAll of 2019, my goal has been to stay clean from cutting and, yea, it's been hard but I didn't realize that the guy I needed in my life was right besides me all along. We started dating in May and are happily together at 4 months now. \n\nWhat's really crazy is, I'm typing this from our dorm room. I'm actually in college. I never expected to make it this far but here I am. \n\nI'm not sure why I'm posting this but I felt like I needed to share.

It\u2019s built up and up.\n\nI\u2019ve thought a lot about suicide over the years but always brushed it off.\n\n6 weeks ago I almost went through with it (day after my psyche nurse told me it was a clear and well thought out method.. not reassuring for them..

This time I went to the bathroom to slit my wrist. She sensed something wasn\u2019t right and got to me before. I thought I was being really quiet but she told me after she heard lots of noise so maybe a subconscious cry for help ?\n\nAfter the emergency psychiatrist visit they decided I should go in to care for a week or two but as I have my own business and had a large contract to tie up they said I could wait until Monday (tomorrow) under my wife\u2019s supervision. She has confiscated all my razor blades (I shave with one of those old style safety razors) and I have some strong anti depressants/anxiety and sleeping tablets that she gives me when I need them.\n\nA couple of days ago while the went to get the kids from sport I played with a kitchen knife. All my kitchen knives are cheep pieces of shit. I laid in the bath and I managed some cuts on my torso. But they were pathetic. I\u2019ve had worse from thorns in the garden ! Human skin is tough and these knives were crap! My psyche asked me why my torso.. I didn\u2019t want to traumatise my kids or my clients with arms cut up. I can keep my torso to myself. \n\nTonight I was cleaning the garage and found my box of blades for my Stanley knife. I sterilized it and managed some proper cuts down my pec. It relieved the tension ! Blissful almost. Any way like I say I\u2019ll be in care tomorrow so there\u2019s no danger.

I also just worry that even if I went, nothing would change \u2014 I can never be truly fixed. \n\nI\u2019ve had a self harm issue for a long time that\u2019s just slowly evolved (this also relates to graphic suicidal thoughts that worry me, but I use pain as a way to distract myself instead). I started with little things, since my family looked down on it, I would purposely fall and scrap up my hands and knees. I punched walls, knocked my knuckles against hard surfaces, slammed my face or arms, sometimes short cuts on my arm that I blamed on my cats. Then I would pick at them to keep them from healing. I thought it was okay and I wasn\u2019t weak if I did it like that. \n\nHowever, when I moved out of my parents house, I had the freedom to do what ever I wanted to my body without anyone seeing. So I started cutting my legs. Since I always wear jeans, it\u2019s never been an issue. \n\nProgressively my cuts have been getting deeper and I know that I need to stop.

{"post_id": "d4yn4x", "created_utc": 1568628876, "title": "Copycat Cutter In High School", "author": "john_kennex", "self_text": "Note that I started self-harming at the age of 14, and I still self-harm today. Note also that I cannot disclose the location of where I was, for my own safety. Names and genders (not including my own) may have been changed for privacy reasons. For reference, I am a gay male. The school system used here is the UK school system, the one I grew up with. \n\nWhen I was 15-16, I'd just started year 10, and I really wanted to make friends, since I had been a loner all my life and was tired of people telling me I had no friends and using that against me to prove mental instability. Note that I didn't really want to do this, but peer pressure got to me at the time, and I just wanted people to shut the fuck up about me. \n\nSo I met these people who were already friends with each other, and we bonded over the MCU and comedy sitcoms. At the same time, I also made friends with a girl called Hanna, who seemed alright. \n\nI was obviously new to all this, but I did want to try. My mental health has always been a fragile thing, a disaster and a roller-coaster ride that never ended, but I had grown used to it. Trauma was almost a weekly if not daily thing for me, and had been since I was 5 years old.\n\nWell anyway. This was back when I had no knowledge of the Internet, having not been allowed on it properly yet, so we all exchanged email addresses, and talked to each other that way. I found people to talk to about my self harm, and my mental problems, and they didn't shut me down. They listened..sometimes. The point was that they didn't label me a freak. What I should have noticed though, was that word was spreading of my self-injury, something I had never really noticed. At the time, I would cut my left wrist during long sessions in the toilets, and wear a homemade wristband made to cover it up. It was neat, and covered them well. \n\nHowever, I often found myself showing the cuts openly, though I never did it when I was fully aware of the consequences. I would either cut openly or display the cuts but not for attention. \n\nMy mind would be manic, if you could call it that , and I felt high, exhilarated. I'd lose any ability to give a fuck about the situation. I would find myself laughing almost hysterically, sometimes actually hysterically, and saying things that would probably be seen as disturbing now. I'm not usually like this, as I'm much more self-conscious and don't act like I'm high all the time. But when those fits struck, I would *feel* high, despite not taking a single recreational drug in my life. Think a genderbent Cassie Ainsworth but more psychotic than harmless. And no, these strange lapses didn't always come after a self-harm session. \n\nMy reasons for the self-harm were obvious though - depression, anxiety, ptsd, depersonalisation disorder, BPD, anorexia nervosa and possible bipolar or schizophrenia. The latter two were never officially diagnosed, but bipolar runs in the family and my former psychiatrist stated that he was unsure of whether I actually had ADHD or my symptoms were bipolar symptoms. So far, the ADHD has been obvious, so I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar. As for the schizophrenia, that's pure speculation, and one particularly nasty message, but I've strayed from the point. \n\nAnyway, as I was saying, things were going okay, but only between the group and me. My friendship with Hanna was wearing thin. Mainly due to the fact that she would outright bully me then ask for favours, and my long-suffering mind struggled to understand that this was a form of abuse. She'd poke fun at something I did, and then find a way to ask me for a favour, albeit a stupid one, i.e. lending her a pen when she didn't have one.\n\nI did began to notice it soon, however, and finally snapped, telling her that I was done with her fucking bullshit. She didn't respond, but as the days progressed and I began to grow closer to the group instead, I started to notice that Hanna would always be there. At first I shrugged it off, it wasn't that big a school, but then I realised that she was slowly easing her way into the group. Suddenly, the friends who had shown either kindness or tolerance towards my self-destructive behaviour were no longer behaving that way, and one day they called me to an empty bathroom during class hours and held an impromptu meeting.\n\nI was a little confused by this, and so asked about what was going on and why.\n\nThe story poured out. I had to either stop self-harming or stop discussing it. It was \"triggering\" someone in the group. Not fooled in the slightest, I confronted the person speaking, immediately inquiring if Hanna was the triggered person. They didn't evade the question very well, and I knew I'd struck gold.\n\nI told them that she was *not* triggered, and that she was doing it for attention because that was what she wanted. She wanted them to stop paying attention to me, and start sympathising with her instead. This was revenge for daring to leave her for other people. Naturally, this sounded too much like a persecution complex, and nobody took me seriously. They only repeated themselves, and promised to \"help\" me the best they could.\n\nI knew then that it was too late to do anything. As the days passed, Hanna became the blameless victim, who was now scratching her wrist (no blood, just shallow white scratches) with a ruler before they came in, then displaying the scratches as casually as possible. She became everyone's favourite person, and the table we sat at together suddenly had room for her too. She'd be called to join group hangouts, and be picked when the group had to pick teams (I was never picked.) And all the while, I was being pushed slowly out of the group, as she took centre stage. As someone who was already too anxious to meet up with them during breaks, I stayed in class, writing, instead of joining that group downstairs. This gave her the opportunity to become a stronger part of the group, and even told a secret about me that involved my sexual orientation to the whole group when I wasn't there. They knew I was gay, but this particular secret was not Hanna's to share. It had been told to her in confidence and I never wanted it out. (One of my 40+ suicide attempts was because of this incident.)\n\nI felt deeply hurt, because I had never wanted attention from them. All I really wanted was someone who didn't abuse me and call me a freak for being what I am, and who I am. Note that I had grown up with abusive, gaslighting parents, in addition to my original trauma. \n\nPretty soon, the group no longer included me officially, and one of my strange fits of mania ended the friendship between me and the group leader, after they'd immediately tried to wrench a mirror shard from me. Just to clarify, I was not hurting myself, and the shards were not that sharp, considering the fact that this was a small mirror, and had some kind of backing that made it relatively safe. \n\n\nI simply broke the mirror and found the shards beautiful, so I wanted to show them to everyone. I didn't know why three people were trying to hold me back as the shard was ripped from my hand. In fact, I still have a small scar today on the palm of my hand from where the group leader scratched me with the shard as they tried to take it.\n\n\nWell, after that, I became even more estranged, and only spoke to about three people from that group of ten, especially since I was told indirectly by someone speaking for someone I thought I was in love with (the group leader) that either I had to stop cutting myself because I was triggering poor Hanna, or the group leader would keep ignoring me. I turned to heavy bruising for two weeks during that period and managed to get word through only that I had stopped *cutting.* Of course, they hadn't expected me to call their bluff, and still refused to talk to me or even look at me for the rest of high school until they left. \n\nI won't go into the extremely abusive friendships that followed between me and the two who stayed friends with me, as that particular story is still painful and confusing as hell.\n\nWhat I *will* get into is how I was severely villainised by friends of one of these two, who deliberately set me up in a conversation then claimed that I'd responded very differently from what I'd actually said. This was in 2016-17.\n\nThe conversation had been about Hanna and how aggravating she'd been, playing victim and placing me at the top of the \"people to avoid\" list. The person in question, Harley, asked me what I'd have liked to do to her for it, and I said I'd like to \"teach her a lesson in the worst kind of way\", a reference to the Fall Out Boy song, *Just One Yesterday* by which I hadn't meant anything specific. I'd simply quoted the lyric because it sounded appropriate. Harley immediately went \"BDSM?\" for some reason and I was really shocked, going \"No! What the hell? I definitely feel like hurting her but I'd never even *think* in that way. Hell, the worst *I'd* do is punch her in the face.\" \nHarley changed the topic, and I thought that was the end of it. Except.. It wasn't. \n\nHarley's friend, the one who had been abusing me all this time, suddenly asked me if I thought it was \"okay to rape someone because they pissed you off.\" Confused as hell I told them they were out of their mind, and nothing would ever condone rape as a solution to anything, ever. Slightly suspicious, I added that I'd never said that. \n\nThey muttered \"just asking, chill\" and I put it down to them being either fucked up, or having misinterpreted the original conversation I'd had with Harley. But that wasn't the case either. Not long after, they told me that if I really think that raping someone because I'm angry is okay then I should give them one good reason to not block me right now. I lashed out at this point, having had enough, and they pointed out that their \"informant\" (whose name had been blacked out conveniently in the screenshot shown to me) had never even said the word \"rape\" in their lives before this, and that they didn't know whether to believe me or the informant. \n\nAfter about five to ten minutes of argument, they told me that if I'd been innocent, I would not have gotten angry. \n\nThis, being a whole new level of fucked up, was something I didn't know how to handle. \n\nI had never said those words. \n\nI had never even implied them. \n\nI was angry and the worst thing I'd thought of was punching the daylights out of Hanna, something I'd never done, despite how I'd felt. I'd taken it out on myself instead.. And yet here we were. \n\nThe incident was skipped past later, and never really revisited but it makes me sick to my stomach that anybody would ever spread that kind of lie about me. \n\nBut now I come to the end of this post, and I really want to ask if I was right about Hanna, or if I'm just really fucked up.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I felt stuck, I couldn't even reach my phone to ask for help right then, so after at least 20 minutes when the bleeding had slowed down a little, I put down my bath towel (which is brown, thank god) and stood on that so I could reach under the sink and grab a pad to wrap around my arm. Once I did that I could take care of the rest easier, but I didn't bring tape for some reason so I had to use all my elastic wrap to secure the pad to my arm and the dressings to my legs. Couldn't wrap my stomach but it wasn't as bad so I'm just letting it bleed into my shirt lol.

It's normal to smoke or drink or even use some kind of drugs to numb the pain. At the same time cutting and tearing your body apart from the *outside* is somehow forbidden, wrong and horrible thing to do. I don't say cutting or any other form of hurting your body is somehow cool or good, but I really can't understand how it differs from smoking and drinking, which usually impact your body even more badly than cutting. I mean, if you don't try to slice your veins, cutting is probably more healthy (yes, it leaves \"ugly\" scars, but it doesn't affect your lungs or liver etc). Probably it's just about the human nature, it doesn't seem normal to actually attack your body. Still, I sometimes feel it's unfair that people treat me as a insane, because I like to kill the pain with cutting, not with smoking/drinking.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

(A message about our new chatroom; please read)", "author": "Rach0", "self_text": "Hey everyone! \n\nMaybe it\u2019s my lack of sleep, or my new medications, but I\u2019m feeling adventurous. I\u2019ve been trying out the new reddit-based chat feature, and we (the mods) feel like it might be a good time to try it out with the sub. 5 years ago, we had a tiny chat group with fewer than 20 people on a good day. I made some of my best friends in that group. Obviously I don\u2019t think that\u2019s 100% replicable because our sub is SO much larger than it was back then.. But I DO think we can gain something great from a chat. \n\nI\u2019ll be transparent and say that this gives us mods some anxiety. We get quite a few trolls through here. And while we do our best to block, ban, remove them and their comments as quickly as possible, the use of a chat feature could make this more difficult. It\u2019s going to take us all as a community to help ensure it\u2019s a safe place. If it ends up not being a safe place, we will have to turn off the feature. We will not compromise the safe space that we pride ourselves on creating and moderating. \n\nWith all that said, we\u2019ll have some rules in place to hopefully keep it running smoothly. As always, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me or any of the mods if you have questions or concerns about the chat. \n\n**Rules:**\n\n* All accounts must be at least 30 days old. This is to prevent trolls (who typically have fairly new accounts).\n\n* Be respectful. Always. If you don\u2019t like what someone is saying, leave the room. If someone is being a jerk, report the comment and message a mod. Please don\u2019t get into a fight. We\u2019re all in a sensitive place, or we wouldn\u2019t be on this subreddit. Be mindful of this.\n\n* All rules of the sub still apply. No discussing ways to further harm yourself (no instructing). No releasing personal information (phone numbers, other usernames, addresses, etc). Don\u2019t be an asshole. No pictures of self-harm. No suicide threats. No encouragement of self-harm or medical advice. \n\n**Consequences of rule breaking will be as follows:**\n\n* Warning by moderator \n\n* 7 day ban from chat\n\n* Permanent ban from chat.\n\n*Extreme cases will be banned from chat immediately and, depending on the offense, from our subreddit as well.* \n\nI want to reiterate that this is not an idea that came lightly to the mods. We went back and forth on whether this would be an overall positive idea for the group, and we decided we would try it out. I hope it can be successful, because I\u2019ve seen how wonderful group communication can be. \n\nAny questions? Concerns? As always, I\u2019m here to discuss any (constructive) feedback. \n\nIf no one has any feedback, concerns, or recommendations, the chat will go live on Friday, Sept. 20th. \n\nStay safe, \nRach.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Not deep, but just long. I cut 8 times. 8 long FUCKING cuts on my stupid wrist in one day. I hate myself. When I was done with cutting I cried with my bloody wrists.

I have 4 friends and they are the best friends I could have. I like them. And also today... a girl from my class saw my cuts and... she smilled. She is very shy. She only talks when the teacher tells her so or when she talks to her friend. So anyways. She smilled at me during class today and after school she walked up to me and said you're not alone. That made me feel better... we talked for a bit and she told me she has a few cuts on her thighs and showed me the cuts she had on her wrist. I felt really good. I decided to just hug her.

It should have been empty because this one frat had gotten kicked out of that floor, so I ditch the freshman and walk over to the dorm. I hear guys chanting \"Durrill! Durrill! Durrill!!!\" I have no idea what's going on until a window shatters as what I assume is a fur coat flies out and hits the ground. As I get closer, I realize that this 'fur coat' is a spider monkey. Once he gets reoriented, he picks himself up and he is madder than hell. He goes over to the bike racks and tries to destroy some bikes, but being only a little spider monkey, he can't do much. After figuring this out, he leaps into the laundry house and starts throwing clothes all over the place, finally running out with somebody's Superman underwear on his head. As he's looking for the next target for his rage, a friend of mine pulls up in his Mustang. I can see the evil flicker across this spider monkey's eyes. Even though I hate Ford, I'm not letting Durrill tear apart this car, so I run over and clothesline him, and we fight. He got my arm up pretty bad and I should have had stitches, but I finally tied up his arms and legs with his tail, tied him behind my van, and flew him like a kite 25 miles away and left him there.*\n\nThat being said, It's been almost 2 years (20 September) since I've gotten in a fight with this evil spider monkey Durrill.\n\nEdit: formatting\n\nEdit 2: This is just a fun story I made up for whenever someone asks about scars.

It was a piece of his memoir, and this snippet was about him getting blackout drunk on his first day of grad school (I can't recall the title, but it made allusions to quantum leaping). There's a point in the story where he just pulls cocaine out of his pocket and snorts it in the school bathroom, and there was only about a line devoted to it with no buildup or fanfare or nothing. It struck me as odd that someone could speak so casually about just finding a gram of coke in their pockets, even knowing that makes sense for an addict. But here I am, spending so much of my time with my thoughts consumed with ways to cut myself and in my reaction, I guess I'm just the same way.\n\nI used to cry and panic when I thought about self harming, even when I went through with it. So the timeline is that I got clean for two years, had a minor relapse, was clean for six months, relapsed, was clean for three months, relapsed, and now we're going on five months clean, but I don't think I even truly care about clean streaks anymore. \n\nI've spent a decent chunk of every day over the last two weeks in particular just thinking about hurting myself, and I'm so laissez-faire about it that I only really noticed today that's pretty fucked up.

I'm so lazy and tired these days that I can't be assed to put in that kind of effort, which makes this maybe the only case where that actually worked out in my favor.

But then it\u2019s more positive because drawing a heart is like a symbol of compassion/support for myself rather than cutting which is like a symbol of punishment/criticism/harshness with myself. Plus I use different colors like pink and sky blue so that\u2019s nice too LOL. Idk this is a random blurb but I just was kinda happy that this worked for me", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Last Sunday I fucked up badly. I ended saying fuck it and ran into the bathroom cutting my left arm and thigh. I didn't use anything too sharp, I used a fountain pen and a regular pen. It did cut but not too much, the fountain pen did most of cutting. I started to feel detached but I kept wondering if that fuck up was the thing that would finally make me take my own life. I kept thinking about what would happen because of this fuck up. Would I actually try to kill myself? Would my parents finally kick me out? Do they still love me? I ended up calling the suicide hotline because I needed someone to talk to. The conversation went ok. We talked and she gave me some kind words. I felt a little better. I ended up not eating and I pretended to be asleep so dad wouldn't confront me about. It worked although when he got home I was tempted just to get all over with. I could hear him telling my mom what happened and her shock(I didn't tell her about it, I didnt want to ruin her day). I kept panicking, wondering if he would storm into my room to wake me up and yell at me. Thankfully that didnt happen. I barely got any sleep. The next morning I woke up almost forgetting what had happened. I still felt terrible. I went through my usual routine and  wasn't until my mom and I got into the car that we started to talk about it.  I told her what happened and she told me that she still loves me and that I could learn from this mistake. I was breaking down at this point. I kept telling her that I wouldn't learn from this because I dont learn from my mistakes, that she shouldn't love me because I fuck up too much, that I wanted to die, and that I thought dropping out of college would be for the greater good. We continued arguing and crying in the parking lot. I kept debating myself whether or not I should go to class because of how bad I felt. My mom needed to know if was going to go to class and I kept thinking about it. I ended up going. I went to library to try to get further in a reading I had to do. I barely got through 5 pages and I ended cutting myself in the library bathroom. I used my fountain pen but it barely cut my thigh. It still hurt, it had a burning pain to it. I still went to my classes. After class, I went to the campus bookstore to try and find if they sold sharp things. I found out they did, mainly art supplies and box cutters. I debated myself whether or not i should buy a box cutter. I ended up not buying one because I was afraid the women at the counter would catch a glimpse of the cuts self harm on my arm. I was increasingly anxious about confronting my dad when he picked me up I was surprised by how forgiving he was. I guess he had time to cool off and maybe my mom told him what I said that morning. He told me he forgives me and that it could've happened to anyone. So my day got better. The next two days went ok although I still haven't forgiven myself for the incident and I barely got anything done because I keep thinking about all the other things I have to deal with. Yesterday got overwhelming. I didnt finish the reading I had to do and I wasn't even close to finishing the essay we had to write about it. Along with all the other stuff I have to worry about(taking care of my brother, my other classes, what I'm going to do with my life, etc). I decided to cut myself again. I initially tried using the sharp part of a bottle cap but that barely cut. Then I got the idea of using a razor blade. I opened one of my razors up and a blade fell out. It took me a bit to figure out the best way to use it. I ended giving myself a few small cuts that I quickly covered with band aids. For a few seconds I was only focused on cutting myself and nothing else seemed to matter. It felt relieving in a weird way. I felt like I could finally get away from how how I felt. I still didnt get anything done and I barely slept. Today I skipped my classes to try and get that paper done, I'm closer to finishing it but now I'm home and I cant focus because I have to take care of my brother.  I can't do both. I also have a mountain of other work due this weekend. I'm not sure if I'll cut again today. Hopefully not. But the more the stress piles up the more I want to cut.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Not me. On the few times I've cut myself, I've done so on my forehead.\n\nWhy? Couple reasons. One, I'm a huge pro-wrestling fan, and when wrestlers need to bleed, they often do so by cutting their forehead, a practice called \"blading\". Forehead wounds hurt about as much as they do on the wrist or thigh. However, they are much more visible, and bleed pretty profusely. Which quite frankly, is part of the reason why I did it that way. I don't want to hide my scars, I want everyone to see them. I don't want to suffer in silence, I want my pain to be known to the world.\n\nAttention-seeking? Pathetic? Absolutely. But when you've gone your entire life being told that your feelings aren't valid, you do what it takes so that people understand how you feel.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Looking back he probably wouldn't have cared if I was slashed up as long as sex was still on the table. After my daughter was born and her dad and I split I stopped (mostly), worried he would use it against and I would lose her. So over the past 12 years I mostly only sh during major lows in my life. The last time being about 2 or 3 years ago. (I cut a little too deep and wore a maxipad strapped to my leg for 3 days until the bleeding stopped (yes I changed the pad regularly)). \nFast forward to now. The past few months have been rough and getting rougher. So to be honest it's been a long time coming. A few months ago I bought big Band-Aids and Neosporin. A week or two ago I bought a 10pack of blades. Today I couldn't stop thinking about everything that was wrong. Every bad thought followed by visions of sharp things. So I got everything out and ready and after my shower I turned on some NF and started on my upper thigh. Being that it's been a long time and because of what happened last time I was afraid of going to deep I ended up with some disappointingly small scratches. So I threw a bandaid and clothes on, laid in bed and scratched a small part of my arm with my fingers until it was  slightly raw. I feel a little better. Physical pain, to me, is much easier to deal with than mental or emotional stuff. If you made it this far, thanks for listening. I know I'll be alright and will get through this rough patch. This is just where I'm at right now.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

Well, not voluntarily at least. People who know only know because of my failure to adequately cover them, and even then I refuse to go into detail and get very defensive. I've been cutting since I was 11, and I've been saying the same old excuses- Oh, my cat went crazy on me, I scraped my arms on a branch as I fell over....shit like that. Maybe people only believed it because they didn't want to believe the alternative, maybe they were genuinely oblivious. Recently I've noticed my mum pay more attention to the ones on my ankle that I did a few months ago (marks are still very prominent,) but I always managed to cover it up.\n\nLiterally 5 minutes ago she came into my room and I had my legs up and she asked what the cuts on my leg were. I covered them with my other leg and she kept trying to move it so she could see but I didn't let her. She kept asking what it was and when I did it. I just did what I always do- Oh I don't know, it was ages ago, don't touch it it hurts.... (don't know why I fucking said that one.) She left with a concerned look. She knows. Of course she knows. I have been doing this for 5/6 years and she did not have a single suspicion. I just know she knows now because of how I reacted it and how obvious it was that they were self harm cuts. I don't know how to feel or what to do. I really don't want to see her hurt expression when she finds out I've been doing this, and I just KNOW that all of the memories from when I was younger making up excuses about whatever cuts I had will flood back into her mind and everything will just.... click? She'll realise what they really are. I mean, she looked at me like she was truely unaware of just what I am capable of. She knows I have mental health issues and all that but I am VERY sensitive when it comes to my self harm, and I don't know how this is going to impact our relationship. \n\nI convince myself I am deceitful. That the image I project onto the world is all just a makeshift imposter. I'm not sure if this makes sense to anyone, but every negative emotion I feel- guilt, regret, shame- every time I am affiliated with any action that hurts another individual, I automatically think I am deserving of punishment. And it's true, that's how my brain works. I see self harm as a form of punishment to myself. I drive myself crazy in thought loops asking myself am I evil? Am I an imposter? This is my secret. Cutting is my secret and I crave secrecy. I love it. So you see this is very big for me, and I really don't know what to do. I already feel shame...it's like a cycle?

A human can survive without food a whole week so I don't count my diet as not enough.\n\nBut I feel weak, tho. I want to cut but I barely have enough motivation to do it with this little hunger that I feel. I still cut but I feel like it's not enough. I just don't want to bother with cooking food for myself. And I'm not rich enough to order any more often than a coffee and a burger several times per week. And I can afford ordering that much only because I'm not buying any more food than that and not eating much more than such a meal for the day.\n\nI'm starting to feel very demotivated and upset lately. My bf says that I might have depression. But I don't think I do. It's a serious thing so I shouldn't just say that I have it unless a doctor would say so.

The one thing that I do somewhat often is every time I\u2019m very upset, crying, and crying because of my own mistakes/anger at myself I just hit the fuck out of my head. I\u2019m still not completely mentally healed obviously, but I\u2019m not depressed right now. I don\u2019t have a diagnosis or specific way to describe it because I never have the energy to see a counselor when I\u2019m depressed, but it\u2019s some sort of chronic depression that occurs when something that\u2019s majorly upsetting happens (ex: breakup, failed class, social struggles as a teen) and then I\u2019m not even upset about the thing anymore I\u2019m just extremely depressed and usually having suicide idealization until something bigger in my life changes for the better to pull me out of it. This has led to me transferring from my dream university last year to a university closer home because I was so depressed after a breakup. I\u2019ve had anxiety my whole life, but it\u2019s gotten worse as I\u2019ve become an adult and feel like I can\u2019t keep up with functional human being things. I can do things for others such as work and go above and beyond for friends and family, but can\u2019t even clean my room to make myself comfortable at home. \n\nSo anyway now the actual important reason behind this post. I got a tattoo a few days ago on my hip. I used to self harm on my hip. One of my (sickly) favorite parts of cutting was the constant reminder of it being there by the burning of the cuts rubbing on my jeans and in the shower from water running on them. Well my tattoo feels the same way. It\u2019s gone down from burning now as it\u2019s scabbed over, but I still can\u2019t stop thinking about it. And the itching of the healing process is another thing reminding me of cuts healing. It also doesn\u2019t help that a lot of the tattoo is done in red ink and is mostly just line work, so it seriously looks like cuts. Agh I think I can get through this, but it\u2019s hard.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I\u2019m slowly but surely getting over the whole I-am-forever-damaged-and-ugly-nobody-will-ever-love-me-when-I-look-like-this mindset, but as I said, it\u2019s not so much about the scars themselves as it is about having a choice. I\u2019m not an angry person by nature, yet I often feel enraged by looking in the mirror and I\u2019m tired of being this way. So if anyone has gone through something similar, how did you manage? Unfortunately, I also can\u2019t go to therapist with this at the moment due to me relocating and having very little free money, but I\u2019ll surely do so as soon as the opportunity strikes", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I note needing to see blood, because my objects aren\u2019t very sharp, I don\u2019t press hard, I just go over and over and over the space until I finally see some red. I don\u2019t know why a I do this and all i can think is that I want the attention. Someone here said they did it as defiance, a little bit of \u201cyou think I\u2019m not hurting?

Why the hell do I feel these urges to hurt myself, even though sometimes I can be in a perfectly good mood? Why do I currently want to hurt myself?? I can give life events and current events in comments if that will help more, I just...

I'm reluctant to start cutting again because of the scars, but right now it's feeling like an attractive solution again, especially since it's late and my bf is sleeping, so obviously can't hit my hand right now.\n\nI have an intense urge to stab myself in the stomach, or slice across the palm of my hand, or cut myself on my stomach and thighs.\n\nIdk what I want from this. My heart hurts. Maybe just venting, idk, but rn I feel like I'm suffocating and need to cut my way out, or stay trapped.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I've basically gotten rid of the part of my brain that gave me the urge to sh, or at least surpressed it enough that it doesn't make an appearance in my daily life anymore.\n\nFor this, I have somebody to thank. It's not my therapists, they made it worse. It's not my psychologist, he made it worse. It's not crisis, I literally tried to kill myself twice because of them.\n\nIt's my amazing boyfriend. When we started talking, we were in late 6th grade. It wasn't really talking, though. I don't know how it came about but every time we saw eachother in the hallway, we shouted bork at eachother until we were out of earshot. I didn't think much of it, but I should have, really.\n\nFast forward to mid-late 7th grade. We were talking more. We started having real conversations with eachother. He also struggled with depression, I found out. His parents were complete nutcases and he had almost no support in his life. I didn't like that but I never had any luck with anybody else and I thought he was way out of my league, but in hindsight I really should have shoot'd my shot. (I know it's not a word but shot my shot sounds weird)\n\nI remember vividly one time in 8th period, he was clearly going through something. So, I started scratching his head which is what do do best. I don't remember the exact reaction he gave me, but in response I said \"Woah, I didn't know you felt that way\" which is basically my signature line when somebody makes a slightly sexual remark or \\*cough\\* noise directed at me. That would have been a good time to say something but I kept my mouth shut because again, I thought he was way out of my league.\n\nThen, right before 8th grade started, about a week or two before, he added me on Snapchat. I added him back and just to bring us back to our roots, I said one thing. \"bork.\" He said bork back, but then added on \"Btw you mega cute.\" I was kinda shocked, but I didn't want to get my hopes up so I just asked if it was a friendly compliment or a \"Hey man let's do\" kind of message. I asked which one and he told me to guess. Should have been an obvious sign but I can't take hints if they're written in 50pt font.\n\nEventually he caved in and said he liked me. We started dating and I promised him that as long as we were dating, I'd stay clean from sh. It's worked! I've been clean for about two months now and I've never been happier. I'm excited for any and all adventures we can share together, the memories we make, and the happiness that just seems to link us together all the time. Jay, I doubt you use Reddit and follow this sub but if you do, I love you more than anything. \n\nIt's been amazing seeing what you all have accomplished and I'm proud of every one of you. In most cases seeing people leave subreddits is a bad thing, but seeing people post about leaving this one makes me happy. They've found something or someone to motivate them to stay clean.

I was in 8th grade, and i had a blade on me for some stupid reason i brought it to school, unbeknownst to a lot of people they had the drug dogs come in. They searched everywhere in the classroom. My blade was in my wallet in a pocket but the dogs sniffed it out. I kinda knew something was up, so i  had to wait in the hallway until they were done. Being out there i was shaking from nervousness. I had the feeling in my stomach. The vice principal was called in and a few minutes later they called me in. Walking in i was trembling. Scared and nervous.\n\nThe cop pulls out my blade and explains that i could get into trouble for bringing a weapon to school. But he makes me show my wrist. There were some fresh cuts. From there it was a blur, this was going on for a while. I had scars and fresh cuts on my arm.   It was always on my right arm. But from there i got pulled from class and had to talk to the counselor. Sitting in her office i couldn't explain why. Because i truly couldn't tell the truth of why i started.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the time i was living with my aunt. They were my legal guardian, so she was called. But they also had other students who had some stuff they also needed to deal with. So i was let go to class. I was almost in tears and I didn't have my jacket on, so i felt the difference in temperatures, i was hot from the anxiety and cold from the AC. Sitting in class i couldn't concentrate, i sat by myself and just thought about what happens next. As the class was finishing i was called out.  Meeting my aunt i couldn't lookup. I looked at the floor and didnt say a word to anyone, not even a glance. In the car ride, my aunt and uncle were saying stuff, not anything bad, but was trying to understand the situation.\n\nAt home, i once again couldn't bring myself to do anything but sit there. I come from a native American background, so my aunt and uncle were talking in Navajo, i couldnt understand fully but they wanted a ceremony done for me. That day was filled with silence and not looking at people. They called my uncle who is a medicine man. They had a cedar blessing, basically a prayer. I sat there and your supposed to say what's bothering you, while the cedar burns. But once again i couldn't verbalize or admit what was the reason. Throughout the ceremony, i sat there basically emotionally empty. Then there's another ceremony where the medicine man basically \"sucks\" out the bad things, i don't know the name, but he pulled out this black stuff from the back of my neck. He said prayers, and it was over. Part of the ceremony were supposed to give our story, i couldnt but my family said what they needed. One of which was how they were worried i was suicidal. I never considered it but i was always aware of what i was doing. After the ceremony, my aunt wrapped my wrist in an ace bandage while also putting on Neosporin. We also counted the cuts, 24 were all on my right wrist.\n\nAfter that i stopped wearing long-sleeved shirts, and opened up more, but not about the incident. For a while i was basically watched, i was never put in therapy or anything like that because we couldnt really afford anything like that. But i promised i would stop. For a while that was true, i put up with random counting of my scars. Watched when we were alone. But i feel like i did get better and did stop, until the past week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently, starting college has been a whole new experience. But i was already stressing and i found my self looking for alternatives to calm down. I have social anxiety, so the thought of college was eating at me. For months my anxiety was worsening, i started to smoke marijuana to get a little relief. Living in a house of a drunk i seriously considered taking a swig. But before i could follow the family tradition, i started college. With social anxiety it makes it very hard to make friends, so for years i (still) dont have friends. Loneliness mixed with all my emotions again, this time i didnt have mj to take me away. Im an artist and i have an xacto blade for cutting out pieces of papers. But i used that. Its not as sharp as it would be, because i dulled it but i did it. Not deep though, just cat scratches. They currently scabbed over and is coming off, still doesnt change tha fact that i wasted 4 years. 4 years of being clean, wasted. I do feel ashamed and have started wearing jackets constantly again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason this began was because i came to terms im gay. In my family it was always the butt of jokes. The world around me didnt really accept it as much. But in 5th grade is when i knew, ive always knew i was gay i just knew now it wasnt the best thing to be. Ontop of that my social anxiety started going in full swing. Those two things and my inability to speak my mind. Im a closed person, i dont open up to many people, which is why i started. All my emotions was bottled up until they exploded open, and i found a release for the many emotions i felt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, i still cant open up cause i have no one to open up to. Ive tried many times. Ive given up hope id meet anyone. So with lonliness and emotianl botteling up, i started again. So i just had to get this out there. I feel lighter now that i finally gotten it out.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

A little attention from your friends. Any kid who had to use crutches got to be able to use the elevator. I don't know. Probably something along those lines from the ages of idk-13?\n\nLater in life I think it transformed into validation. I wanted validation that something was wrong with me so people would just give me a break (no pun intended). The thing is I don't want the attention now. I don't want people to know or to feel like I'm looking for attention. At this point I think I want it for my OWN validation. Like I think I've realized I need someone else to tell me when something is wrong in order to give /myself/ permission to take a break or take care of myself. \n\nThe first several people at the Urgent Care said they thought there were a couple of small fractures and showed me on the X-ray. I was pretty surprised. Went to an orthopedic a few days later who basically said  he didn't know what they saw because he didn't see anything (even though everyone else who had looked over and asked what happened thought it was... and he never even took any new X-rays). Still had pain at the follow-up a few weeks later and one of his residents/assistants/co-workers etc basically said that they HAD assumed it was a fracture based on where the pain was, the fact that there was pin point pain, how I fell, etc.\n\nAfter the second appointment since he thought it wasn't a fracture (\"or if it is it's very very small\") I was only given one of those bulky braces. I actually started wanting to hurt myself even more. I kept thinking and thinking and thinking.\n\n \"I'll show you a fucking broken wrist. You're too fucking pussy to handle that much pain? You made yourself look like an attention whore for nothing.\"\n\n I've had a history with having a high pain tolerance and my parents not believing or belittling any pain I have because I don't show much physically  (hard to bruise, can usually push through pain, swell minimally). Now that I can legally take myself to the doctor, and I know what a broken bone feels like for me (had my jaw broken a few years ago and had an uncomfortable numb and tingling feeling; it's just a very different feeling for me) I finally trusted my instincts and went there. I felt like such an attention whore at that second appointment.\n\nThey actually offered my the choice of a cast or to keep wearing the brace at the third appointment though. Since there was still pain and at this point most assumed it HAD to be a small fracture. I wanted to get that cast so bad. I dreamt of that cast man. That validation for myself. \n\nI said no. I said I'd use the brace. I don't know if it's because I didn't want anyone to think I was being an attention whore, or if I wanted the choice to hurt myself more. I regret it. Because of my high pain tolerance I can't stop wanting to hurt it more. There's something calming yet thrilling about that deep pain when you know you've fucked up.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I miss deeper yeets but also fear the reaction of whichever doctor removes my stitches and sees a recent should've-been-stitched cut.. sooo yeah idrk", "subreddit": "MadeOfStyrofoam"}

I'm always questioning if I really am allowed to open up so much to someone because surely it becomes a bother after a while and could cause things like emotional burnout, and I'm so scared of losing her because she's so important to me and she deserves everything, and I shouldn't be there to drag her down with my depressing self. \n\nso eventually I told her a few examples of what I think about, and in reply she messaged her thoughts to each of my thoughts. of course my messed up brain interpreted a few of them in the wrong ways, but overall I know she meant everything in the best possible way because she's just that kind of sweet and wholesome person I do not deserve to even have in my life. \n\ntoday at school, we talked for a little bit in the morning about it and I told her that she means a lot to me as well, and thank for for listening to me. \n\nand later, as I was lowkey panicking internally over a stupid maths problem in class, it sort of triggered my trains of thought and I sat there realising that maybe someone does actually care for me. maybe someone does actually care about me living, and maybe someone would miss me if I wasn't alive. \n\nbut then I thought, \"it doesn't work like that. someone isn't allowed to care about me because I'm not worthy of it. I'll only become a burden and she'll regret having ever cared about me.\" I feel like I'll just hold her down. \n\nit just kind of hit me that even if someone did care for me, I would just reject that care. I'm here waiting for someone to start caring, and when I realise someone does care, I'm too scared to accept that care for fear of something. I guess I'm scared I'll lose her, because I care so much about her and want her to live the best she can, and for her to always be happy.

While it may seem like a shitty thing to do, both me and my sister have been raised to never cry, every time we have for anything seemingly petty to my mother she's always been extremely harsh about it.

Sadly my therapy sessions ended before I could speak about this to my therapist as it was right around the time the business partner ran away with all my families savings...

Killing me slowly\n\nNow I've only gone as far as injuring myself with bruises and mild domestic torture (the classics of Legos, blunt battery, and mild electrocution) but nothing that'll go as far as damage anything internal. I've never been doing it consecutively further than how often my shriveled pituitary gland validates me with any accomplishment...

Punishment (T) : There were times when it was for punishing myself for fucking up but so very often it wasnt that. \n3. Outburst (M) : Wanting to get the self hatred a physical outlet.

It made sense. BUT recently it struck me I think another aspect of it is : when I cut I know I exist. I have a physical effect on the world around me. I am not a data point in some statistic. I have a real tangible effect on my surrounding. That is probably why cutting deeper is so appealing. I can have big noticeable impact on the world around me.

I\u2019m currently unemployed, enrolled in a boot camp to facilitate a career switch. I\u2019m way behind, but so close to being done. It\u2019s stressful but manageable on its own.\n\nI started an anti-depressant a few months back when I last hit a low point. At that point I was completely unproductive, not very communicative, and started planning ways I could off myself. Being there was so fucking horrible and scary. I never want to go back there again. Life was reasonably better after starting the med though the adjustment was a bit rough.\n\nAside from my GP, I never told anyone about any of what was going on then until about the middle of last week when my wife asked me when I was going to be done with my course. I decided that I should probably come clean-ish about that dark period to buffer the explanation of where I was in the course at that point. The conversation wasn\u2019t strained but I didn\u2019t get much more than \u201cif you need to talk to someone you should\u201d from her. Maybe my expectations were high but a hug and \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d would have been nice.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve felt the old habits slipping back in; running myself down, calling myself names, \u201cyou\u2019re stupid\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019ll never do this\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re a terrible father\u201d, \u201cthey\u2019d all be better off without you\u201d, \u201cworthless shit bag\u201d, etc. It\u2019s just like, fuck man, I can\u2019t go here again... stop.\n\nMy dad died Saturday. Mostly I just feel guilty that I could have treated him better, spent more time with him, been less selfish. It\u2019s a weight but manageable on its own.\n\nA couple hours ago I was looking at a capstone project of a fellow student and was just sick to my stomach about how good his work looked. As I\u2019m going through his project my thoughts are flooded with negativity about my own abilities. My wife was next to me in the car, I sent her a link to the project via text and said something about how good it looked and it was the done by \u201cthat guy I get lunch with sometimes.\u201d She comments that I was supposed to be done by now, she has to transfer money from savings at the beginning of the month, it makes her grumpy... and I just go cold. All I could do was listen to the shit in my head start up again while offering a weak \u201cI\u2019m working on it every day. I know it sucks and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d And then I go quiet.\n\nI hate the quiet. It\u2019s like a The first step. If I can\u2019t pull myself out of quiet then it\u2019s going to get dark.\n\nSo we get home and I start cleaning up a little to distract myself. I grab some socks from the floor and take them into our bathroom to the dirty laundry. And I just snapped on myself. My method is punching myself around the head and face. Every time it happens the punches land a little harder (enough to hurt but not hard enough to bruise), the episode lasts just a bit longer, the screaming at myself in my head a little more cruel and demeaning, the tick-tock landing of punches a little faster. Tonight I got myself good enough to lose my balance a bit, which was good because it snapped me out. I ended up standing in the closet with my head against the wall, breathing heavily, feeling like shit, head pounding, but enjoying the feeling of warmth flooding into my cheeks, jaw, and ears. I wanted to cry but couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d feel better, maybe, if I could but I can\u2019t produce more than little moisture. A few minutes later I\u2019m breathing normally, check myself for bruises, and go join the family, but I\u2019m still quiet. It\u2019s such shit.\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll do it again. I\u2019ve done it for years already.\n\nThat\u2019s a long post and if you made it all the way through, thank you for \u201clistening\u201d. I\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t really fit the theme here but god damn I have to get it out somehow.

Maybe shallow styro. \n\nSadly I enjoyed it way too much. Those cuts are what it took to finally feel like it was enough, and I'm a little worried for myself because of where they are and the fact that I'm fucking my head up the more I do this.

(i already had some, but at the time it felt like life or death) i was told that i stumbled into a dark room containing an xray machine, which i began harassing until (male) nurses were called to come restrain me. i fought them tooth and nail, and it took 4-5 to get me back to my bed. i remember straining with all of my might to get up, to get water so that i could survive. i was pouring sweat, and my body was on fire. the nurses managed to strap me down, and the last thing i recall before slipping into unconsciousness was a sharp stab in my neck, and a radiating warmth creeping from it followed quickly (but in my mind, as slow as universal entropy) by blackness swelling from the outside of my vision until everything was void. i woke up in a different room, hooked up to an IV, with a minder sitting idle in a chair. i had been tranquilized, and given sedatives and was still tripping, but with much less intensity. after a day of monitoring in the cardiac unit to make sure i hadn't put too much stress on my body, i spent a few days in the psych ward until i was deemed fit to leave. for days my whole body ached terribly because of the intensity of which i resisted restraint, and for years after i was convinced that i had died during that experience, and that i was experiencing a sort of simulated purgatory. i still have spells of derealization where i have to actively ground myself back into reality. it is something i eventually made peace with, in the sense that if this was some sort of unreality then it feels real enough for me in this moment. one would think this would be enough to deter me from stepping back into that experiential portal, but i repeated this torturous exercise again and again. i hated myself so much that it felt i deserved it. \n\nthere were many times where i would use LSD every day for about a week, with exponentially increasing doses each day. i know this isn't the proper way to use this powerful tool, but at the time a sober reality was not something in which i was comfortable, and i fell in love with lucy the day we met. i obtained many of vials of liquid, and would drop it on marshmallows if not straight under my tongue. the first day was always the best, with each successive experience reduced in potency due to tolerance that i attempted to combat by taking more and more. the first day 300mics, the second 600, third 1200 and so on. besides being a  waste of money, this really messed with my perceptions of experience. in the moment, i would frequently get stuck in loops where i would obsess over some mundane dilemma, come to some wild conclusion, and repeat over and over. it felt like i was solving great mysteries of the world, but in reality it was the psychological equivalent of repeatedly slamming my head into a wall. for years after i would have derealized episodes where i would fixate on an aspect of my experience in a paranoid fashion, and ruminate as if the questions i had even had meaningful answers. this was exacerbated by my OCD, anxiety, depression, and dissociative episodes. \n\nthere are a few miscellaneous shards of memory that come to mind while writing this out. i'll detail a couple here, without context as the full story is lost to me in an amalgam of altered state. \n\nthe iron statues of men: frozen, running perpetually toward an unseen target resembled rats to me in the dark winter night. i reclined beneath a leafless tree to take in the sight, and looked upwards into the cloudy sky, pierced by stark branches like roots digging into clay.\n\nwords inscribed on a monument, detaching from their cold prison and reaching out into my eyes, the letters constantly shifting and morphing into pseudo-hieroglyphs which i witnessed in silence.\n\nmy arm which was broken at the time, in a cast, pulsing with warm tingly energy. i stared into the darkness of my room and absorbed the patterns washing over my vision, transforming everything in fractals and waves. \n\nstaring at the illustrated gold filigree on the blue cover of a book, as it twisted and turned in a complex dance like serpents in  a lake reflecting an empty sky.\n\neach tick-tock of my clock tearing through the fabric of a silent eternity.\n\nsometimes it feels the only thing that will ground me from the terrifying unreality is cutting myself, the pain feels like a wave of ice cold sea water blasting me into the present.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I took this voluntary year as a chance to be 100% myself in a completely new environment, and so I have also embraced the scars on my arm and stopped hiding them. Most people who see them just ignore it, for which I am very happy as they don't define who I am as a person. But in the two months that I've been here, two people have asked me about the scars. One of them asked if they were from an accident, which I found very weird as they very obviously aren't (I posted a picture of the scars, scroll down my profile to the third post to find it. They are completely healed and quite faded, but still trigger warning!!). I told them both that I don't want to talk about it as it already is a very difficult subject to me, and I can't possibly explain it in spanish as my spanish isn't close to being good enough for such a topic.\nSo, now my question to people from south america, especially Bolivia, is: how is self harm perceived here? Do some people maybe don't know that it is a thing at all (thus assuming the scars must be from an accident)? Is it a taboo subject and I'm offending people by showing my scars openly?\nIt would mean the world to me if someone took their time to explain more to me \u2764 thanks in advance!", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I started self harming primarily because of my emotionally abusive parents and problems relating to that - I'm turning 20 but still financially dependent on them and I don't feel safe trying to get a therapist again until I (hopefully - plans are in the works) cut them off next year. In the meantime, they keep adding stress and anxiety to my life and I don't have any way to avoid that rn, nor can I effectively address any of the problems they've caused while they're still creating them. I know self harm is bad for me, and I plan on trying to stop after I'm in a better situation, but I don't feel ready to tackle that on top of trying to cope with my parents and sometimes even suicidal thoughts. But, in the month that I've been doing this, I've already reached the point where I don't fully feel satisfied unless I hit styro. I don't know how long it'll be until hitting fat stops being something that scares me and starts being the only thing that works. I don't know if I should tell my friends about this if I'm not planning to stop - they'll probably freak out and I don't expect them to necessarily understand why I'm doing this. I feel like I could almost get better so easily right now if only it felt safe to do so - I've been avoiding anything other than a couple very light scratches for a couple days because I'm visiting home from college this weekend and don't want to risk the bandages giving me trouble, and it's gotten a little easier - but I know I'm going to get worse again anyway like I always do and I feel so trapped and frustrated about the circumstances that make really stopping seem impossible right now. I keep seeing people urge people to stop sh now, or as early as possible, how much they regret having done it and how they wished they had stopped earlier, and I know that, but this feels like just another symptom of problems I never had a say in. I know I wouldn't be doing this if I had gotten out earlier, or maybe if I had better support, but I'm just so tired of dealing with all of this and trying to get better while I'm still being hurt and things are just getting worse.

During mid summer, my parents helped me with my cutting and decided to spend more time with me. They also started talking to me more and checking up on me. For the first time in a while, I felt so relieved and somewhat happy. Then... school had to start again. But a bit before that, I finally got the confidence to go short sleeved. After that went good, school started like I said. I'm 100% sure some of my friends saw, but they didn't say anything. All is going okay, I'm wearing some long sleeves because they looked really cute; then something happened yesterday. I was waiting for my best friend (the one who gave me the box cutter, like I said in my last post I believe). I was wearing a short sleeve, short enough that it shows my deep scars. I was also waiting for my best friend because he had my sweater I had him hold but I forgot to get it back. So while I was waiting, I\u2019m standing next to my other \u201cfriend\u201d I sometimes talk to when I wait for my best friend. I\u2019m talking to him and it goes silent. I then hear him say,\n\n\u201cNice scars.\u201d\n\nI look at him and ask what he said. He then started teasing me about them. How they looked fresh, (like I said I\u2019ve been clean for two months now), how his girlfriend used to do \u201cthe ol slicey slice\u201d I stayed quiet. I know there are people who joke around about this and I too, enjoy dark humor sometimes. But never about self harm. I started getting sad but I tried not to show it. Luckily, I see my best friend walking towards me. I don\u2019t say anything to the \u201cfriend\u201d Unfortunately, I start breaking down to my best friend and pleading for my jacket back. He quickly got it out and asked what\u2019s wrong. I explained to him a little bit later during class. He was not happy and threatened to fight him. I told him to not start anything right now. Because the only thing I was focusing on was how my confidence to wear short sleeves is now gone. I stopped going near that boy. And he can tell because when I pass by him, he smirks in a way. Or tried to get my attention. I hope to rebuild that confidence back up soon..\n\nWell that\u2019s it. Thank you if you made it.

However, I continually have had thoughts about doing it again like it's an addiction, but I suppose it kind of is.\n\nRecently, I've been put on anti-anxiety medication, but oh boy, it's making my anxiety worse, which triggers the desire to hurt myself. I was in a relationship previously where I was told that I'd lose all contact with them and my best friends (the only people I really have) if I ever relapsed, so the one time I have relapsed, I kept it a secret until after the relationship ended. In a haze of anxiety one night, I messaged my current partner and asked if I ever relapsed, would they immediately stop talking to me, and they said they'd do what they could to help me, and it kinda just threw me for a loop. Like it's just a completely different scenario where I'm not in the fear of another's reaction to relapsing. So I'm in a weird state where I have the unbearable desire to do it just once more, and it just feels so weird and bad because of how much they care about me and how they understand and wouldn't hate me and I feel like I'm in a blender of emotions and I don't know how to deal with this.\n\nLike I want to get better, but I have an unhealthy obsession with numbers and remembering dates and I do not remember the exact amount of time I have been clean due to an issue with dissociation.

Not for anyone to see because I hide them just for me to see and rub my fingers over the scar to feel it. Gosh I sound insane. Anyway just need to keep myself away from any sharp objects.

They claimed to have tried to overdose using energy drinks, only to back out when they felt sick. (I was glad they did). They had reassured us that they haven't recently tried at the time.\n\nAt the time, I was new to self harm, and suicide attempts, or just barely anything that had to do with wanting to die or punishing yourself. I had a fresh cut hidden under my watch, and I was still concerned and scared that I had managed to ever do something like that to myself. I wasn't prepared to admit that to anyone too- but I had hoped to get a bit of comfort even if it was indirect. I had hoped to take it slowly, that depending on their answer maybe I would tell them. So I had started with, \"I know how you feel.\" But they didn't press me after that. I had just thought that maybe they didn't want to talk about it anymore. \n\nFast forward in time (like months after), somehow my best friend and I got into a fight (for what reason, I don't really remember), causing our other roommate to be some sort of referee, neutral ground, messenger.\n\nOne day, my best friend had talked to our roommate, to vent. And I know this because that roommate went to me afterwards to tell me what they had been told.\n\nThey said a lot of things. But what really stuck with me was the fact that my best friend thought I was insensitive for saying \"I know how you feel,\" during our conversation that time. That I was undermining their suicide attempt. \n\nI was stunned, confused, and felt betrayed. \n\nMy best friend had just assumed I didn't know what I was talking about. That I said it for conversation, for- for whatever reason. The bottom line was they didn't believe me. \n\nMore pain and betrayal rose in me when my roommate told me to apologize for it- because they didn't believe me too.\n\nSo... that was the moment I started distancing myself from my \"best friend\" and I had started to cut more and more afterwards.\n\nThinking back to it now, now that I'm less mad and just tired, I guess I failed as a best friend for them because I could only assume they had wanted comfort at the time and apparently \"I know how you feel\" wasn't the right thing to say- even if it was the truth. \n\nBut it's fine.

Today I remembered again why I don't actually do it, and felt like sharing the story.  \n\nWhen I was 14 I cut my leg quite badly by accident and had to go to the emergency room to have a couple of stitches, friday night so it was busy.  When I was waiting there with my dad for hours,  he started talking to an older couple who were also waiting.  They were there with their daughter and they were very open about the fact that she'd self harmed.  \n\nThey made her show us her wound, which was hidden by a dressing at first.  It  was high up on her arm and I can only describe it as a gaping flap of bloody flesh.  I was horrified, and the look on her face...  Apparently she'd had a fight with her bf, but what really bothers me in retrospect is how her parents were so mean and dismissive of her.\n\nI wish I could apologise to her for being part of that.  But I also want to thank her, because I always remember her when I get the urge to hurt myself, and I think that somehow she's the reason that I don't do it.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

At 1am she just sent a simple 'sorry' message after I sent her about 50 about how much I was worried about her and when I asked a friend of her where she was she told me that people were getting roofied at the party and that she lost her friend and had to look for her. She was asking others where her friend was and she ended up crying off all her make up and kissing a random cunt because he said he knew where she was.\n\nWhen I woke up today I just felt that what happened to her hurt me so much and that I feel so hopeless in our relationship because I don't live close to her so I couldn't do anything about it.

I've relapsed maybe three times in those seven months but he never noticed until last night. He was holding my hand and started feeling my arms and when he felt the scars he turned my wrist over and asked me when I had done it and why. I didnt really know how to reply and was kind of overwhelmed because no one has ever actually seen my cuts before. I never cut deep and they usually heal without scars in a couple of weeks so it doesnt seem like that big of a deal. Some fucked up part of me was thinking I'd want him to see and make a big deal out of it so I could feel like someone cares but when he got concerned my brain just shut off and now I feel sorry he has to deal with this. We've talked about my mental illness in the past so he knew that this was a thing I had done before but I think he thought I was doing ok. I just hit depression hard this last week and while my relapses used to be a single bad day it's been almost every day this past week and it feels harder to stop this time. He made me promise not to do it again but as soon as he left I felt so alone I went right back to it within an hour. I'd like to stop but at the same time when I'm feeling really down seeing the cuts makes me feel like I have some control over myself and my situation. I dont receive help well from people and my brain is just beating me up for letting him find out more than it is for the fact that I'm actively hurting myself. He talked over the reasons I've been feeling down and was a voice of reason but the guilt from making him feel like he needs to help me only makes me feel worse and want to do it more. I know I'll probably feel better within a week and I just need to wait it out for my brain to start being ok again but I just wish I could melt into the floor.", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

I\u2019m away with my confirmation class. Just a weekend of peace and bible work. Just a normal communion with normal children. Just a good time. That\u2019s what I told myself. Just about two minutes in my hope was broken. It was music. A piano and a woman singing. It was beautiful for everyone else but for me.. it was pure torture. I saw us sitting in your living room. You were playing the piano while I was singing. It gave me goosebumps. You were there just playing. It was a beautifully horrifying memory. As the music stopped I found myself silently crying. I immediately took my scarf and hid my mouth and nose. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna remember. I refuse to remember\u201d Then the priest talked about how we were all connected with our brothers and sisters beneath the stars. When he said that I felt something on my temple and my throat. I realised that.. one my brothers and sisters were strangling themselves. They were killing themselves. I had the urge to scream. To let it all out. But I was sitting a circle with 30 different people. I just couldn\u2019t scream. It wasn\u2019t a possibility for me. I was sobbing and twitching. \u201cAre you ok?\u201d She put her hand on my lab but before she could place it I grabbed it and put it back onto her lab. \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d Not a minute later the music kicks back in. Memories flooding back almost suffocating me. It want in like that for about 20 minutes. Talking then music again. Pain pain and pain again. Then suddenly they told us to stand up. The seconds passed but it felt like ages. \u201cJesus\u2019 body smth smth for you\u201d \u201cAmen\u201d They must not notice my tears. Under no circumstance-\u201c Jesus\u2019 blood spilled for you\u201d \u201cA-amen..\u201d I dunked the host into the grape juice hoping that this would be over soon. It didn\u2019t take much longer until we were allowed to leave. I immediately went up to our floor and locked myself in the toilet. I saw you sitting in front of me. You were being picked up by medics and carried into the ambulance. Then I lost you. It was just me sitting there. Crying and screaming. Then he was banging on the door. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Talk to me. I\u2019m here for you. It\u2019ll be alright. You can share your pain.\u201d \u201cGo away! I don\u2019t wanna talk about it. I don\u2019t wanna share. You won\u2019t understand. Nobody will.\u201d Back and forth. \u201cJust let me in. We\u2019ll talk it out. You\u2019ll feel much better. Just open this door. Come on. OP. Come on open up. I\u2019m here OP. Come on out.\u201d Two minutes. \u201cIf I open the door will you go away? Will you leave me alone?\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll talk.\u201d Another minute. Then I gave in. \u201cWell done.\u201d He saw me. Sobbing. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong. Talk to me.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I.. I\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re obviously not. What\u2019s going on in your head?\u201d Silence. \u201cIt was four months ago.. how does it still haunt me?\u201d Then I saw you again. One pill after another. Falling into your mouth ending up in you stomach acid. Dissolving. I couldn\u2019t breathe. There was no light, no air, nothing to hold onto. Heavy breathing, uncontrollable twitching, Tears. Panic. \u201cLook at me. Everything will be ok.\u201d \u201c It\u2019ll never be ok! Never.\u201d He managed to calm me down and brought me back to my room.

I purposely would punch things that I knew wouldn't break to vent when I was mostly alone and upset, whether that be sad or angry. I've punched things to the point where my right hand knuckles (I hit with my right hand) are severely different than my left hand through injury.  \nI also when getting incredibly upset kind of hit myself. Depending on how upset would decide on where I hit myself, my most upset being kinda pulling at my hair and hitting my head, and not very lightly I should add.   \nI don't feel like I walk away from these situations hurting an obscene amount but I've also done this since I was probably 13, being 22 now so I do feel like my tolerance for pain tends to be pretty high.  \n\n\nI recently saw a post about a character where the character hit their own head repeatedly and the redditors referred to it as self-harm. I've never considered myself someone who self-harms, but I've also always had the stereotypical view of self-harm being cutting, which I know isn't true, so I figured I'd ask here and see how people feel about it. I know I could just look it up but I feel like anything I find would be along the lines of what doctors might say, and while doctors are good imo, I'd rather hear from the community about it.  \n\n\nSorry for Wall of Text  \nTL;DR: I punch things and myself when any kind of unhappy, is that self-harm?", "subreddit": "selfharm"}

He\u2019d been having a really bad day, broke down crying in the shower, mostly from all the stress he\u2019s been dealing with, part of which is me and the severity of my mental illness and the pressure I\u2019ve put on him as a partner and with all of my problems. He said it was just a result of severe depression over the phone, that my stuff was only one small part of a lot of other stress that\u2019s more to blame. \n\nHe knows I\u2019ve been cutting and has tried his best to support me but also has had to look after himself and his own mental health. I already cut myself once today, didn\u2019t tell him though. When we were laying in bed, ready to eat food he ordered, I tried discretely dragging a small plastic knife across my skin. When he wasn\u2019t looking earlier though, I dragged it much harder across hoping I could scar myself. I wanted to feel pain. I also sort of wanted him to notice and ask if I was okay. \n\nHe finally saw me doing it and asked what I was doing, almost kind of amused. I didn\u2019t say anything. He then got really mad at me. He accused of me of being an attention whore for doing it in front of him, that I was being selfish not thinking about how it affected him as someone who was suicidal once, that if I actually was cutting myself out of shame I wouldn\u2019t do it in front of him or other people. He was mad I did it in front of him at all, and was cold towards me for the rest of the night until some time before we went to bed. He said that if I was doing it for pity, he wasn\u2019t going to give me any at all. When I went to go throw out the knife, he started dogging me like \u201cOh okay, you\u2019re going to do it in front of me again?\u201d\n\nI feel bad. I feel pathetic. I ruined our night together.

My dad picks me up and drops me off at school everyday, and i only take the bus home when im feeling super depressed.

I never skipped a class last year, but now it feels like a once a week occurrence. Im irrational and im going to go spend $100 on a money card for money in a game I play.

I'm only using dull scissors but I am deciding to buy a knife to cut with. \nI'm just under a lot of emotional stress as of late so I went back to cutting as my only option, I don't have any supportive people in my life. I don't believe I'm beautiful enough anyways, nobody will ever love nor care for me so that's why I do it. I'm already ugly so I decided to make myself worse...\nI've been in therapy since I was 10, I left last year but I'm thinking about going back and finding a therapist that'll hopefully fit me.
