It's bothered me my whole life. I feel like I have some \"un-evolved\" gene that carried over. Why am I so hairy? I thought humans shed their hair when they started using fire for heat. I'm hairier than any male I see in pubic, on television, in movies, etc... I get envious. There's this fear that I need to explain that some might think is irrational. I'm scared of becoming a \"wolf-man\" meaning my entire face will be covered in thick hair. This first started like a decade ago when I saw a TV special on this man who was like this. I think I may have this same genetic defect, it just hasn't fully set in yet.\n\nRecently I've noticed dark, black hairs growing directly to the side of the bridge of my nose, directly under the eye socket. No one has to shave that area of the face, so what the hell is going on? It's the skin that your upper check before your nose, hard to explain. I fear that if I puck these hairs they will grow back even thicker, and perhaps more will spread. This brings me to another question: what if I accidentally shave \"peach fuzz\"? Will the hair grow in as thick as my beard? This is why I fear shaving and only do it every few weeks. I am scared of knicking peach fuzz and having it grow in thick and coarse. I'm scared of becoming something that does not resemble a human. What sets us apart from apes is that our faces have clearly defined places where there is no hair. I'm starting to think that I have some crazy mutation. Whenever I see men in public, they always have a clearly defined beard line where the hair stops. Why don't I? It goes all the way to my cheeks and up to my eyebrows (which are very thick and prominent, something else I'm ashamed of). All in all, I feel like an \"unevolved man.\" It's gotten to the point where I don't want children to pass on this amount of body hair. Downright fearful to.\n\nI'm not a religious person, but I'm starting to think god is punishing me for masturbating to porn multiple times per week, and living like a glutton, and causing this excess hair to grow. I think it could also be punishment for me having casual sex with women over the last few years. I swear that every time after I masturabte, I notice more, thicker hair growing in places it shouldn't on my face.\n\nI just don't understand. I'm embarrassed everywhere I go. Even for people to just look at my hands. The digits of my fingers have so much hair, and it also goes up to my knuckles. I've never felt normal my whole life. I also don't understand why if my parents and their ancestors come from a warm climate (Italy) why do I have so much hair? It doesn't make sense. It's made me hate being Italian, and whenever I hear jokingly how hairy they are, it makes me ashamed and sad, because it's true for me. Not a religious person, but it is starting to feel more and more like a curse put upon me for living the wrong way, watching porn, and having casual sex.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

He is not overweight at all and has not had any self image or weight issues in the past. He has now asked me to lose a significant amount of weight (60+ lbs) and I'm not sure how to feel. I love him deeply, and would do anything for him, but I'm worried that my mental health may suffer because I am trying to be something he wants me to be. I shudder at the thought of him not thinking I'm attractive, and I can't help but wonder if he is embarrassed to be seen with me, or if he even likes to touch me and kiss me. He has never said anything outrightly rude, but my own insecurities have made me paranoid. \n\nI am wondering, what do you think about this situation? Is he in the right for asking me to lose weight?

A home I went to visit had a doorway that was unusually higher up than the landing, and I could not step inside because the height was too tall for me. Basically, I ended up partially crawling inside, and I felt humiliated/embarrassed even if I think this was mostly the result of my mind resorting to negativity. I\u2019m the type of person where I actually couldn\u2019t give less of a crap about things like crawling in on my knees or outright doing my job on the concrete outside, I\u2019m pretty flexible and open; but it\u2019s old beliefs that still get me, especially fear of scorn/disgust from others.\n\nSome background: I am in a larger body. I\u2019m currently going through ED therapy and therapy in general for anxiety and depression, and Intuitive Eating is really having a tremendously positive impact on my life. I\u2019m reading Jes Baker\u2019s (first?) book and Every Body Yoga to genuinely make progress on loving myself. So far it\u2019s going really good. Also, I had issues with a knee years ago and have consistently engaged in physical therapy to support my body in a good way. :) My body is legit amazing at carrying very heavy loads and walking up stairs, including the maximum height most therapy recommends not going over (if that\u2019s a thing, I could be forgetting). \n\nMy game plan for right now: I think in the past I would have beaten myself up about my weight. But because of my wonderful therapists and the mind shift I\u2019m gradually making, I\u2019ve now switched to finding a solution, and I have a lightweight but super sturdy and safe stair stepper platform I plan to bring with me to help me get into the doorway. Initially I berated myself for being out of shape, too weak, etc. but I confronted that and reminded myself many different types of bodies would have trouble in a similar situation. What if I had just had surgery or something? I know people who way less than I do who\u2019d also have trouble. I think my body was trying to tell me \u201chey don\u2019t try to do this, it might hurt you\u201d especially because I often bring in lots of heavy bags with me on the job. I decided I owe it to my body to respect that.\n\nSo...\n\nWhat I wanted to ask was I guess a few things. Has anyone ever been in this situation? What did you do? Do you have any suggestions, even in general, like about mindset or being proactively assertive for yourself without allowing shame? Comments from people who can relate are also cool. I actually have a lot of background/past shame built into \u201cnot being able to get up into something\u201d because of traumatic experiences in childhood and emotional abuse, so knowing this stuff doesn\u2019t have to be so loaded will help me.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I've struggled with body image issues in the past - in junior high and high school I hated how I looked so much that I wouldn't let any of my family or friends take pictures of me! I hated shopping, I hated the way clothes looked on me, and I stayed indoors during the summer because I couldn't look at myself in a swimsuit, much less have anyone else look at me. Food was my enemy - I was either overeating or eating nothing. It sucked.\n\nIn college I found the gym, but it wasn't love at first sight. I didn't want to go alone, so I went with girl friends who all gravitated towards treadmills, yoga, ab workouts, and Zumba classes (Zumba was a lot of fun and something I would still do!). I hate cardio and yoga didn't get my heart rate up, so my appearances at the gym were spotty at best.\n\nThen, 1.5 years ago, I found weight lifting.\n\nI absolutely love it. I love being strong, and I love pushing my body to BE strong. I got 205 in squat this summer and hope to get 225 one day.

I love how big my quads and biceps are. I like that I can see my abs (most of the time). Food is something I have more control over now - I eat a pretty strict, healthy diet with lots of lean protein and indulge occasionally.  I like finding clothes that I think look good on me and accentuate how hard I work to be strong (this has its own set of problems, as most of my shirts no longer have sleeves since sleeves don't fit around my upper arms anymore, and if they do then the rest of the shirt hangs off me like a poncho). Working out makes me happy.\n\nHowever, sometimes I struggle with men. Men don't seem to respect how hard I work to be strong, and can be creepy, commenting on my body in an unsolicited, sexual way. I hate it when this happens - I feel like all my work (work I've done for ME) is reduced to looking like a sexual object for strange men, and I wonder what the point is.

I like to wear fitted clothing, neutral (grays, blacks, whites, mauve-- love burnt orange and olive too), mostly white sneakers or black booties, and I like a lot of contemporary items with athletic and/or edgy elements. I actually have a lot heels and dresses that I wear when I feel like it and despite my clothing my desk and my home is decorated with alot of feminine things and colors...\n\nIdk it makes me feel uncomfortable when ppl say things like that to me because just because they think I have a \"nice body\" I'm obligated to dress more feminine or sexy. I'm actually inherently a very sexual person-- I'm just more cerebral about it. Of course I find ppl attractive, but I am more attracted to the mind and what ppl can do with my imagination and spirit and I love sex and how it connects ppl. \n\nI love to be surrounded by beautiful feminine things but not necessarily wear them... I lean more to gender neutral clothing to detour some objectification (because ppl still do it to an extent) AND because I feel most like myself in them. \n\nI know I'm ranting, but does anyone get what I'm saying?

I'd step on the scale and see it not move and in that moment my very long day that started at 5am would be ruined.\n\nIt is wild to me how such a little change can completely change how I feel about myself. Life without a scale is a WAAAAY better life. \n\nI am a straight sized woman (I can wear a 8 or a 12 depending on my meals) with a regular curvy body but I have been sold the lie that if I work out and eat in restrictive disordered ways then I will feel worthy. Turns out you can just decided that you are worthy and fake it until you become it. Turns out all I had to do was stop dieting and throw away my scale. I have been on a weight loss journey since puberty and at 35 I have given up and I must say I have never been happier more self assured. All the time spend focusing on my body are now spent doing a podcast. I sleep better, my skin is clearer, I have gained some weight (maybe 10lbs or so). However I have gained \"A LOT of weight according to my elderly neighbor who called me \"succulent\" a few months ago, it was her version of a compliment. She said I looked healthy as she pointed to my thighs and rear and then asked if I was eating a lot lol! Obviously since I was starving myself to be cute for all long as she has known me. I was horrified in the moment but I now embrace it. It's a funny story that I laughed with my friends about. I now talk about my life pre vs post succulence lol! I bought new jeans and kept it moving. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I still have thoughts about weight gain, good vs bad foods but in those moments I try to be kind to myself because I have absorbed a lifetime of diet culture and fat stigma, it is impossible to get rid of these thoughts in 7 months. But I am on my way! I still have fat days where I feel bloated and icky. It is so odd I found the only thing that cures this yucky feeling is standing naked in front of my full length mirror. Its bizzare, but my warped fat phobic mind makes my body feel uncomfortable in clothing but naked I feel how perfect would feel if it was a word with real-world applications.\n\nI invite others to do the same-trash the scale, stand twice daily in front of the mirror in your bday suit (preferably while dancing/listening to Lizzo) and see how you feel after 7 months.

The following things have helped me come to accept my body over the past few years:\n\nThe biggest help has been making a conscious decision to value and respect myself as a whole person, mind, body, soul. It sounds simple but it was the starting point. \n\nI started by prioritizing getting sleep over drinking and staying up late, I needed help from sleeping pills in the beginning but eventually settled into a consistent routine.\n\nThen I started focusing on eating nutrient dense foods -NOT for weight loss but to fill my body with beautiful, healing foods that make me feel GOOD.\n\nI then got into therapy to find some healthy coping skills for stress. Therapy for body image/eating disorder stuff never did much for me, but once I got help for bigger picture stuff ( how do I deal with life better??) I was able to take better care of myself. \n\nTherapy also helped me challenge a lot of the beliefs I had, and I realized how silly it would be if I was really given this one life to just try my hardest to be attractive, like?? There\u2019s just no way that that could be my ultimate purpose here on this earth, but that\u2019s kind of how I was living my life- and that was really sad for me. I started focusing on finding deeper purpose outside of my looks and, even if it\u2019s small things like making an effort to genuinely smile at strangers or picking up litter or taking the time to go to the dog park with your dog because she loves it- whatever it may be, feeling like your living a fuller, more purposeful life can take a lot of focus away from body image issues.\n\nAnother belief I didn\u2019t even know I had came to me while looking at myself naked in the mirror after a shower. I saw my reflection and I realized that as the criticisms started flying around in my head, they were all spoken by other people, or what I assume other people would think if they saw me naked. \u201c oh she\u2019s let herself go\u201d \u201c she\u2019s not that fat, if she just worked harder she could be pretty fit\u201d \u201c why does she have SO MUCH cellulite?!\u201d \u201c if she didn\u2019t have all that cottage cheese she wouldn\u2019t look half bad\u201d \u201cwhat a weird face, good GOD\u201d and I could go on literally for hours, but the point is, after a minute another voice chimed in and reminded me that it\u2019s just a body. Really, that\u2019s it! If I take away all of the things I assume other people would think about my body, and if I take away all the societal expectations of what I think I\u2019m supposed to look like,  I\u2019m left with..... a body. And it\u2019s lovely simply because it\u2019s mine! It\u2019s grown with me, it\u2019s functional, it does A LOT for me on a daily basis even if I\u2019ve emotionally abused it for decades. My body has been with me my whole life, it should be my closest friend, so I decided that\u2019s how I was going to treat her. \n\nCut out any social media that makes you feel like you\u2019re not good enough ITS NOT WORTH IT. Surround yourself with imagery that either preaches acceptance of all body types, or, even better, content that has nothing to do with hair/makeup/fashion/ bodies etc. at all! Get really into dogs or admiring travel photography or really amazing recipes with lots of healthy ingredients AND flavor! What you see all day affects how you feel so don\u2019t fuck around with anything that doesn\u2019t lift you up.\n\n\nAnd lastly, throw that fucking scale away. You don\u2019t need it I PROMISE.\n\nHope these help someone, you all deserve it!", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I've looked at skin lighten creams and consider buying some. When I told my friends abou this, they were all pretty upset with me. They told me that its unsafe to bleach/lighten your skin. They also told me that i need to love my skin color the way it is.\n\nThe funny thing Is that they all get tan and tell themselves that tanning isn't that bad for your skin. I know this is BS. \n\nSo yeah why is it bad that I want to look lighter? I dont want to look white. I just want to look 2 shades lighter.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

But it's changed to an activity weekend and looking at the company's website I can see I'm too fat (I mean this as a description not an insult, there's no point beating around the bush; I am fat) to do the activities. I'm feeling such a mix of emotions, sad because I'm so big, angry that the organisers of the weekend haven't thought about accessibility issues (fat and disability), confused about why exactly I can't take part (is it just that they don't have safety gear that would fit, or could I actually sink the kayak?) I really want to love my body and be grateful for what it CAN do, but it's so hard when society puts up barriers.  I've told them something has come up and I can't go any more and I'm pretending to my boyfriend that I don't want to go and do those activities but really I do want to do them.\n\nHow can I feel good or at least accept my body's limitations?

One side of my face looks like a different person", "author": "hardcorewonderer", "self_text": "So i have been struggling with this for many years. People around me dont know how much it actually affect my life.\n\nEverybody thinks im pretty, that my life is all perfect, and i get compliments and attention all the time. I have no trouble getting men. Little do they know, that i often times lock myself inside crying for days over my own looks. Now i know this probably makes me sound shallow, but i am certainly not, so dont judge me please.\n\nWhat i cant stand about my face is how crooked it is. This is especially noticable when i record films of myself with my phone, and when i put two mirrors together in an 90 degree angle and get to see the tilted side view of my face. My left side is my \u2018good side\u2019, the one i always show on pictures and such. My left side however, is like a totally different person, and i get depressed everytime i see it\ud83d\ude14 how is it even possible, i think to myself as i stand there crying my eyeballs out. Other people say they cant see it, but its impossible not to see these magnificent differences in my face! So who is lying? My mind, the mirrors and cameras, or the people around me? \nThis is starting to get a hold of me and its affecting my relationship. I can feel good one day, but as soon as i look in a mirror and get reminded of my uglyness, my mood goes from sky high down to the bottom of the deepest sea. I dont want to be social, i dont want to go grocery shopping, i just want to sit inside and hide my ugly.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I've never been overweight before, in fact I recovered from Anorexia Nervosa 5 years ago. Even when I was underweight I still wasn't \"thin enough\" to go outside, swim, buy new clothes.\n\nI do have severe generalised anxiety disorder which has played a role in this. I have been \"stress eating\" while dealing with a new leadership role at work and trying to help my boyfriend with his alcoholism. As a result I'm now the heaviest I've been (70kg or 155lbs, which is overweight, almost obese for my height). I want to go get a massage with a voucher from my birthday and go to hot springs and start skateboarding... but I am terrified even just leaving the house. I feel people will laugh and judge and think I shouldn't be doing those things because I am overweight. I am thinking I will wait till I lose the weight... but fuck that, I want to get out and beat my anxiety. \n\nIt feels so much easier to just hide inside and lose the weight, but I know I'll still feel like I'm not thin enough. I know I just need to do it! It has gotten easier to not care as I'm getting older, but just need a bit of encouragement please. \n\nThank you :) and fuck anxiety haha.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}
