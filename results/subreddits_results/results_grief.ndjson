She was 19 years old ( I was 20 at the time, now 22) she was coming home from work, she was on the highway and came to a full stop due to traffic ahead of her, however the semi truck behind her never stopped and went into her, pinching her car between 2 semi trucks. The pain I felt when I found out she had died, the feeling of picking out the clothes that she will be viewed in for the last time. Seeing my best friend in a casket, man that feeling/moment is something I will never forget. She was my foundation. I\u2019m not close with my own family and she and her family are/were my family. Losing my best friend has impacted my life in so many ways. I\u2019m currently going through  intensive ptsd therapy because I\u2019m so scared to get behind the wheel or be a passenger in the car. I am crippled by the fear of dying in my car. This has impacted my professional, social and even my love life. I was doing really good for a while, but lately I feel so crippled by anxiety and depression that I\u2019m having a hard time coping day to day. I\u2019m just looking for some hope and kind words/ advice during a really intense time in my life.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I was adopted when I was 9 and at first we got along well but as I started battling my traumatic past I took it out on her. She was very kind but also had a No-BS -attitude and HATED disrespect. She didn't express affection in hugs or the ways I needed. She was very strict but only because she saw my potential and wanted the very best for me. It led to many arguments and \"I hate you\"'s and words I don't care to say. \nWhen I was 17 I moved out with no regrets. I rarely visited home and even less than that, spent the night. But when I did, I could see my mom's slow decline in health. Every time I visited she became weaker. I wondered whether to make amends, to try to fight and have a good mother daughter relationship as I desperately craved. But I thought it'd be selfish and wanted her to spend time with my siblings whom she loved and cared about. I felt guilty for wanting her attention when I hadn't before, was I just trying to earn brownie points or something? I couldn't even know if my own intentions were right. \nAfter a 2 year period of watching her slowly give in to stage 4 bile duct cancer. I stayed at home for the last week before she died but left again 3 days before her death. I cry in random spurts and at embarrassing times. I feel like I shouldn't be sad because I wasn't really her daughter anymore. I barely talked to her in the years before her death. I felt like a bitch for crying at her funeral. I was horrible to her. \nI'll never forget the day my dad told me that it was me who did this to her. That the stress I put on her led to her getting cancer somehow. I know that's not true but it hurt me to know that he actually thought that at some point. I know he didn't mean it but I can't forget it. \nThis is my third parent lost in 10 years and I'm only 18. I feel lost and scared, and I don't trust that anything is permanent anymore. I don't want to sound like i'm just looking for attention when obviously it shouldn't have even affected me that much due to the fact that she seemed to hate me and my words caused her harm. \nI don't know what to do or how to cope. I've been getting high constantly just so I can numb myself. In fact I'm so stoned now that I can write this how I really feel it. Most of the time i'm too dishonest with myself but now I can freely confront my devil. \nI wonder if I should try to let myself cry it all out or if the crying will never quite go away no matter what I do.\nI miss the mom I never had. All my life, all I wanted was a relationship after my first mother took her own life. My mom could not give me what I needed to thrive but I knew that one day I would learn to thrive on my own. And after I have healed more, I could have that relationship. I thought that one day we would be closer. But all my dreams of a better relationship were ruined when my mom passed away and I was left motherless for the second time. I still feel broken and like I'm missing something. \nI don't know if i'll ever be able to pick up all these pieces or find a way to cope. Thanks for reading.

Unfortunately today happens to be fathers day, as you can imagine. My dad hasn't been doing so well. Brittle bones run in my family, my mother and my brother both have it. Basically for those of you who don't know what it is. Their bones are weak, they can trip and break a leg. Which they did. Alot. My dad has spent the last 25 years of his life caring for my mother. I had never seen a love like theirs, my whole life you could see it in the way that they looked at each other. A few years ago my mother broke her leg. After that, she just stopped walked. Confined to her wheelchair. It was like she gave up. She gained a lot of weight. Her health went down hill. She didnt leave the house once within the last 8 months. She was a stubborn women, a trait of hers I most definitely have. I'm so angry. Angry with her for leaving. Angry with myself for not bringing up my worries about her health with her. She seemed happy. But I hated the fact that she spent her days in front of her computer. I have so much guilt and regret. For not visiting more often, for not putting more effort into messaging. Yes I have a life and in life we get busy. But fuck . I didnt think this day would come anytime soon. I cannot get the images of her passed on the floor out of my head. I'm hoping they they get replaced by good memories. Its taken me a while to come to terms with the fact this is real. A few months back I had this nightmare that I was messaging my mum on facebook, she just wouldn't reply. Because she was gone. I woke up bawling. Now. This is my reality. I can only talk about her. Not to her. I wish I had taken more pictures. I have a few. But I want more. I wish i had cherished the hugs where she wouldnt let go just a little longer. Its become very apparent to me just how real death is this year. Until this year I had never attended a funeral. I had never lost someone close to me. Now. Including my own mother's. I have attended four. I'm really struggling. I struggle with mental illness alot. I struggle to show alot of emotions, unless its anger. I'm so unsure how long I am or I am not supposed to be sad. How often I should I shouldn't cry? I'm so lost. I have no idea what to do or how to feel. I worry about my father. I took him out for lunch today, first time we had ever been out. Mum never really had the confidence to go do things like that. I have visited him alot, we really leaned on each other during this time. But I worry. I cant imagine spending such a large time of your life with/caring for someone. Just to watch them die in front of you. To be without them. I know hes not okay. He has been posting statuses on Facebook every few hours. Which he never used to do. He is staying up drinking. I just dont know how to help? I don't know what to do. I have never felt so lost in my life. This is the first time I have not felt thankful for being numb. The first two funerals i attended were as a support person. The other was a close friend. That hit me hard. Then my mum. Death is not something i am accustomed to. How long is it before you start to heal? Before you stop feeling guilty for feeling happy for a second. Before it stops feeling like the world around you is carrying on and you're stuck still? Before you stop getting upset over the fact that your mother will no longer be there with you to celebrate milestones or support you through your shitty decisions even if she doesn't agree. I guess I just needed somewhere to get this down. I'm not good at expressing myself and there is no instruction book on getting through this. If anyone could help suggest anything. At all.

Grief on top of depression is more than I can handle. The phone calls and text messages from my support group have tapered off. People shy away from conversation when I bring up my dead husband.

I\u2019ve immersed myself in grief books, mindfulness meditation, and group therapy. It helps for a short while, then I am back in the quietness of our house. Who knew quiet could be so deafening?  I find myself just trying to get through each hour so I could just fall asleep at night and do it all over again. I started seeing a therapist. She asked me where I saw myself 5 years from now.

It wasn\u2019t until the last few years that he was able to reconnect with his family. They never accepted our marriage, as it did not fit into the definition of marriage that their religion taught them. I know this broke Steve\u2019s heart. He always wanted to be accepted by them. I don\u2019t think he ever was completely. My sister has been supportive. My parents have no interest in my personal life and will change the subject when I try to talk to them about it.

She was 29 and we'd been together 6 years, married for 1. We didn't have children.  She died suddenly in a car accident on a \"girl's day out\" with her sister and 2 friends. Her sister and one friend survived. Sarah and one friend died.\n\nInitially people understood that I was grieving. Most were also grieving to some degree.  Then after about 2 years people started to suggest I should be trying to \"move on\". The number of my family and friends who talk this way has increased and now (with one exception) they are ALL saying it. Even my wife's parents came over to talk to me about it. Even they gave me the \"do you think Sarah would want you to be this way\" speech.   \n\nI know they are all doing it out of love but they don't understand how I feel.  I have tried to explain it in as much detail as I am able but it's not sinking in.   \n\nI will NEVER get over losing Sarah.   \n\nI went for grief counselling 3 months after I lost her and again after 2 years.  I understand that it's normal for the grief to ease and for the person to eventually move on. I just don't think that will happen to me.\n\nI HAVE improved. When it first happened I couldn't function. After the initial shock I accepted that she had died but I thought the pain would kill me.  I don't know how I got through the funeral.

It's not that they're not nice people. They have been mostly attractive, funny, warm women but I only want Sarah.   \n\nThey are never going to be Sarah, so I don't want to try. Nobody seems to get it. The only person who doesn't do it is Sarah's sister. She was driving and survived the accident. She is too consumed with guilt to be trying to set me up with someone. She comes over 2 or 3 times each week. I always have to reassure her that I don't blame her for the accident.

I've grown to despise my own inhibition. I have always been nervous to say certain things or talk about myself, the few times I did with him would always spark progressive and engaging conversations. I always learned from him, mostly about myself. So much more could've been shared between us. I just thought I'd have so much more time to build that relationship. It was still more than I've ever connected with anyone. He saw himself in me and was able to guide me, it hurts to think he never had that. I thought about how I'd tell him the story of seeing him in the ER. Even when he was dying, I thought we'd still end up talking about it. A large portion of my life will be fixated on this one aspect of the past. He was the realest person I knew, and now nothing feels real. I can't go fifty seconds without thinking of him, something he showed or taught me, something that relates to him. He was so much an integral part of my being. I discovered the world and myself through my older brother. Otherwise, I'd still be equally terrified and self-repressed as before. He helped me turn myself into an individual. \n\nSome people talking about forgetting someone is dead, going to type in their phone number, and having it hit all over again. I haven't forgotten once. I can't stop thinking about it. My brother is dead. He is nowhere. I can't find him. \n\nI had a dream the other night. We were driving in his car at night time. He was going to drop me off somewhere, there were no words spoken but I just knew he was dropping me off somewhere. I was scared.

I started crying and I didn't want to get out. I was sobbing, I wanted him to ask me what was wrong but he only looked at me. I woke up sobbing.\n\n I'll never hear him again, we'll never sing a song together ever again, he'll never laugh again. I just have to keep living my life exactly the same. As if everything is the same. It's only almost everything. School was already monotonous, I already held disdain for most of the things people say. It's all meaningless and it's never felt more prevalent. He always hated the expectations in life. Go to school, grow up, get a job, make money, die. I guess he found another way to display his defiance and took a short cut. I just have to keep dragging myself forward. I can't wait for school to end so I can just live my life.

I've been holding so much inside, and I don't really know who to turn to. I'm trying to stay strong for my family, especially my grandmother and father (it was his dad), and it's leaving me feeling like I have no shoulder to cry on. \n\n\nI've always been very close to my grandparents, me and my sister are their only grandchildren.  My grandmother has had health issues for years, so I've spent a lot of my time helping her. Well that all changed about a month ago. My grandfather was hospitalized, and his health was fading fast. They released him from the hospital, and I took him to all of his appointments and such. \n\n\nWe had a small family vacation scheduled for the end of August, and we were going to cancel it. My grandfather insisted that we go because he loved where we were going (said it was one of his favorite places in the world) and it wasn't terribly far from home. While on vacation he wasn't doing great, but was trying to make the best of it.\n\nThe morning we left to come home, he sat in the backseat of my car, with my grandmother in the passenger seat and my parents riding in a separate car ahead of us. About 30 minutes into our trip and he asks me for some Tylenol, said his back was bothering me. Well, I didn't have any on me, but my mom did in the other car, so I told him when we stopped I would get it for him (we were stopping in about 15 minutes). He said okay, no problem. We get to the gas station and I look in the rear view mirror and see that my grandfather is sleeping (he wasn't). I tell my mom he wanted some Tylenol, so goes to give it to him. I started crying like a baby, for no reason at this point. My father comes over to me and just looks at me and I knew. He passed away in the backseat of the car while I thought he had just fallen asleep.\n\nIt was like it was meant to happen there though. There was an ambulance with 2 EMTS, and a cop car in the parking lot. My mom got the paramedics and they confirmed he had passed. We had to wait for the coroner to come, all the while my grandfather was in the car because they couldn't move him until the coroner arrived. Everyone there was nice.\n\nLast week I kept busy, helping my grandmother, dealing with phones calls and deliveries and handling all of the funeral stuff. I think it kept me from thinking about things too much. Since the funeral though, I've been a mess. I keep thinking what if I had just pulled over when he asked for Tylenol? Could he have been saved? I feel like it was my fault, though logically I know it's not, but I can't get it out of my head. I could have done more for him, I don't know.\n\nI don't know if it's grief or guilt or what it is. I don't even want to drive my car anymore because I just keep seeing his face in the rear view mirror.  The car has too many negative memories. And I keep expecting to see him again in the backseat.\n\nI'm sorry this story and stuff went on so long, I had to get it out, it's driving me crazy. I miss him and I'm worried about my grandmother now. I just wish he was here.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

That was my wife. Isn\u2019t she gorgeous? I have no idea how I won her over. I mean, I know what happened. I just don\u2019t know how. Here is the story of what happened:\n\nIt was 8 years ago that I kissed her for the first time (on September 9th. I was going to wait to post this on the 9th, but I\u2019m impatient). The previous spring she had told me that she wasn\u2019t interested in dating me, so I was operating under the assumption that we were just friends. I was attracted to her, and wanted to date her, but I didn\u2019t want to pressure her, and I was okay with being friends. I stuck with her as she was going through treatment for leukemia, and trying to recover from her stem cell transplant (the thing that would ultimately kill her a few short years later, September 27, 2014). At some point she realized how loyal I was, and changed her mind about me, but didn\u2019t know how to bring it up.\n\nOn Monday that week (Labor Day, September 5th, 2011) I went to her place, and we watched a movie together, and part way through she started sitting so close that our arms touched. That felt like being more than just friends to me, but I didn't want to push it, so I didn't say anything. We made plans to hang out again on that Friday, and on that day we ended up watching another movie, and once again our arms touched, and again, it felt like we were more than friends. I was a little frustrated at the situation because I didn\u2019t know how to deal with my feelings.\n\nAfter the movie we went to a park where we could see the stars. As we sat down on a bench I decided to put my arm around her, just to see what would happen. We sat like that for a while and eventually she put her hand on top of my other hand. Then I started holding her hand with our fingers intertwined. Our faces were close together and she would glance up at me and then look down again. She did that a few times, and I wondered if she wanted me to kiss her, so I decided to go for it. She didn't kiss me back, and then lowered her face from mine, and my heart sank. I thought I had misread the situation and that she was going to be mad at me, and so I waited for her to yell at me.\n\nInstead, she said quietly that she had never been kissed before, and that she was sorry it was so awkward. She said that it seems we're more than just friends now, and in kind of a daze I was like, \u201coh...yeah...okay!\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s the story of our first \u201cdate\u201d.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tq8mz80y9pk31.jpg?width=384&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=992b90e68c9bf58a4fdba6fcbc594751a65e4480", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It took us three hours to get there instead of the usual 40 minutes. For much of the drive, we could only see where the road was by the lights of the other cars. The sun rose so gradually, I didn't notice it at first, until the world outside had gone from black to gray. \n\nPappa and Helen were both such clever, funny people, and for those three hours it was like we were in our own little world.

She had schizoaffective disorder so her life was obviously hard, but I never imagined she would take her own life. I have 3 siblings (I'm the youngest at 17) and all 4 of us have grieved and been there for each other. I had a rough relationship with her. I'd been exposed to her episodes before and for the past year or 2 I refused to visit her or I just got so much anxiety and dread around our visits. Obviously, this adds guilt. I think she needed more love. In one of her MANY journals, she asked about who to love even when nobody loved her, which completely broke my heart. I never dreamed of something like this, in fact after acknowledging how hard my parent's lives have been I wondered how neither of them committed suicide. A lot of my friends underestimate how much I love her because I was always complaining about my mommy issues, but once it happens it's horrible.\n\nThe first few days after it happened, I was more suicidal than before. I felt like I needed to run away or escape in any way possible. It wasn't worth it. After that, I felt completely OK. It was almost like it never happened. Instead, it was just a fact looming over me. I didn't focus on it but it was just like a cloud reminding me my mom died. Before it got better, I had a good and long cry. I cried while laying in my dad's bed and tears would legitimately not stop coming (I can feel tears as I'm writing this tbh) but it felt so good afterwards. However, when you grieve, you kind of go through cycles at times and sudden waves of sadness hit at the most random times. On top of this, I just started senior year. I was late the first day because before then, I hadn't been eating or sleeping normally. The cycles are basically you feel terrible, then suddenly you're fine and nothing feels wrong but the next day you're afraid. Ever since it happened I realized how fragile life was and got even more afraid of death. Now I think I'll die every day, even if I'm not going out. This is a random addition, but have you ever hated when people say things ONLY for attention? I hate those kids, but once my mom died talking about it or even just writing about it is so therapeutic. I'm going to therapy soon, but I'm still afraid.\n\nUsually I have the sense of humor to joke about tragedy to play it off, but this time it's clearly different. Since some of my friends knew how much I complained about her, they think they can joke about it in front of me and expect me to laugh. Sometimes I do, but other times it's not OK in any situation. I hate to be that \\*triggered\\* person, but even seeing someone choke or suffocate is hard for me. I'm not entirely sure why I wrote this, but it helped me process my feelings as I was writing. Other than everything previously stated, I'm more resilient than I thought, but it's simply a case of not knowing what you have until it's gone.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I saw it when we were resting in my dad's room in his family home, my mom trying to take a nap and me digging through the past in the drawers. My father's family weren't the best at archiving their past, but very good at hoarding.\u202c\n\n\u202aWhile reading aloud my cousin's secondary school biodata project and cheesy essays about ghost encounters, I looked over to my mom to see if she was okay and, well, she wasn't. On the mattress she shared with my dad for five years before we moved out, she was laying on her back watching something in her head. Then, she made a joke about my cousin telling tall tales in his essay about my uncle being sporty, when he's just the lazy TV/newspaper type. I'd never seen my mom lost before, she's always very driven. \u202c\n\n\u202aMy parents always made me feel like they were complete. Bickerings and all. They were together almost 24/7, in the house or in the office or whatever. Like how you'd expect happily ever after to be like. Just now, she came to my room crying for moral support and I sat and listened and reminisced about my dad's silly habits when he was alive.\u202c\n\n\u202aI also found out what is it she was watching in her head that day. Almost everyday, to be exact. I thought it had been good memories of them together. No, it was of that moment where she stood by him as they tried to revive him, when his heart suddenly stopped in the stroke rehab centre. She told me she was calling out to him to wake up and come back, but she felt completely helpless. His chest began to move again so they tried to put on an oxygen mask to help him breathe. It didn't work. The doctors took turns pumping his chest, while she stood stubbornly by his side to watch. And this image is just stuck on replay in her head. \u202c\n\n\u202aIm trying to convince her to use a counseling service recommended by the funeral director. I also suggested she made a visit to our family doctor, as he had prescribed me a mild sedative to help with my own anxiety. I'm also trying to be more available for her when she needs the company. I think the thing that triggered her panic attack today was our disagreement on what to do with my dad's garden, and that she had spent the whole day alone while I was doing my own things out of the house for once. \u202c\n\n\u202aIdk. My mom keeps saying she wants me, us, to move forward from all this but I feel guilty at every attempt at trying to. Like properly maintaining the garden or just having the desire to move out and have my own life. I was already planning a game plan for making something of myself as an adult before my father's death. When he called us to tell us he was having trouble staying focused at a last contract job, I was about to finalise and submit my final year project for my bachelor's and I thought \"yes, now I'm ready to work and have a career and move to my own place and have a stable and mature relationship with someone.\"\u202c\n\u202aThe former I still have the zeal for, but the latter I'm unable to open up to. How is love really worth it when life is so unpredictable? And no amount of time spent with a significant other is ever enough. My parents were together for 23 years, I'm turning 22 next month, and she still feels like it wasn't enough. And nothing ever is truly enough. \u202c", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Growing up, my parents were abusive alcoholics so I spent a lot of time at their house. Her dad, Mike, was always strict but caring. As I got older I cut off contact with my parents and grew even closer to my friend's family. When I had my first child it was like something switched on and this stern man turned into the softest, most loving Papa you could ever imagine. My boys love that man more than anything in this world and he has literally been the perfect grandpa. Their father hasn't been consistently in their lives so Mike was even more important in their lives. \nWe were supposed to be spending Easter weekend with them but we ended up having some financial issues and couldn't make it. He had a massive heart attack that Saturday. We would have been there to get him to a hospital but he died alone and the weight of that is crushing me. It's hard to breathe if I think about it too long. I've never felt loss like this and watching my boys go through this makes it more painful than I thought possible. \nThe thing is though, he wasn't my dad. He was my friend and her brother's dad. I don't feel entitled to have this much grief. I feel guilty for thinking I know what they are going through. Or that my hurt is on the same level as theirs. It feels so selfish of me.

All those \"what if's\" that are only tormenting me. Also, I know better but it feels to me they are downplaying her death and that kind of makes me angry. No, I don't think it was ment to be. She was healthy and could have lived a lot longer if she had not been alone. I think not being with her on that day is my biggest regret I have.\n\nA few weeks after she passed I had a dream. \nI was in the yard and my grandma came over, as she usually did, and we talked and i hugged her, I could smell her, but somehow I know she was dead. I asked her how she was here and told her that she was dead. She said it was stupid talk, and my mum came outside too. \nI woke up just as they convinced me that I was just imagining things. I was so happy. \nI could not get out of bed the next day. \n\nThere are days, like today, when I just start crying when I think of her. I love her so much. She was the most loving and selfless person I knew.\n\nI kind of just wanted someone to know. \nAnd I am aware that I am not at any fault, but the feeling is kind of there.\n\nThank you for reading. I'll try to add a picure of her if I can figure out how.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My dad died in January after a shocking diagnosis of stage 4 cancer in Sept 2018. He was dead less then 6 months later. He declined so rapidly I still have trouble comprehending it now. He went from golfing in July to needing a wheel chair in Oct. Lost a ton of cognitive ability due to the cancer matestizing to his brain. I was heavily involved in all of his treatments and care which I am so happy about but was also traumatizing. \n\nI got married in Dec and we moved into our first new home in Feb (both of which were planned before my dad got sick). Both of these events while wonderful were completely overwhelming given what was going on with my dad.\n\nI ended up quitting the job I had while my dad was sick in April. Talking about him all the time, being reminded of him and all of the things that happened there became too much. l took another job offer but could not handle the social culture at that place and quit after a week. I was not in the right head space for lunches, dinners, happy hours, constant team building activities. I couldn't be \"on\" all the time and felt like I was going to have a breakdown.\n\nI ended up quickly finding another job in May (my profession is very in-demand in my area) and liked it at first but it began to become increasingly stressful within a month of being there. \n\nI found out I was pregant the second week of July. I was so excited and happy. Before that I honestly didn't ever think I would be able to get pregnant on my own without a ton of medical help. I was able to track when I would have gotten pregnant and it would have been right around Father's Day (that day was also a massive struggle for me). I felt like it was a sign from my dad even though I don't normally believe in those things. \n\nI had a horrible day at work beginning of Aug. I was in tears all day due to a bunch of things that had happened and when I got home and used the washroom, there was bright red blood when I wiped. The next day I started heavily clotting and bleeding through a pad every 10 minutes. I went to the hospital and they confirmed I was having a miscarriage. I initially thought the stress of my job was what induced the miscarriage though I realize now that is not the case. \n\nAgain, I could not face going back to that job after that. I ended up quitting. I am now taking some time off for myself though I feel like a massive failure. I have never been a job hopper like this in my life and feel like I am ruining my career which also adds on a ton of stress. It takes everything I have to get out of bed in the morning.\n\nMy husband is fully supportive of me. He wants me to take as much time as I need and work through my emotions. I am going to therapy but so far haven't made any major break throughs. \n\nI feel so lost, so down, so scared. Whenever anything even minorly stressful happens, whether it be at work, in my personal life, wherever, I turn into a sobbing, nervous wreck. I've never been like this in my life. I barely cried before my dad got sick. Now I cry all the time.\n\nIf anyone has read this far, thank you. I think it's cathartic for me to type this out. I don't know what I'm looking for other then maybe people who can relate and for someone other then my husband, therapist and mom to tell me what I'm going through is normal and that I'm not a massive failure.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I don\u2019t know anything else that suffocated me so much. \n\nTo start with, my grandpa (and grandma - she\u2019s another story) raised me since I was a newborn until he passed (I was 19). Figuratively, he is my father. I have a father who I do occasionally talk to. He\u2019s alright. I love him. But he did not raise me and I never lived with him (or my mom). \n\nHe died from cancer. It was so weird. Fucking weird. He didn\u2019t tell me he had cancer. Which is so like him. I estimate from the facts I have now he was diagnosed in February with lung cancer. He died in May. But he never got \u201cbad\u201d. I didn\u2019t know he actually had cancer until late April. He had a seizure late May, went into the hospital, and died 9 days later. So you can imagine the amount of SHOCK. I was so naive standing in the hospital next to him the first few days that he was sick... but he would come home. I didn\u2019t have much time with him... but I had time. I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t have ANYTHING. And, I was 13 weeks pregnant soon to be single mom. \n\nSo he died. And this sounds so callous of me because if I could show you guys the amount of tears I have cried I\u2019d need a fucking ocean. I\u2019ve cried so much I\u2019ve made myself sick. I\u2019ve cried so much I have wanted to die. I\u2019ve been angry. At him. At life. At everyone who has their dad. I\u2019ve been in a frozen state over how quickly he died, and other times relieved that it happened quickly. He didn\u2019t want to be a vegetable. We had many conversations about it over the years where it would end with \u201cjust pull the damn plug\u201d and we would laugh. I told him to do the same to me if it ever came down to it. God. \n\nBut. I\u2019ve been through the stages of grief like I had season passes and for the most part on most days I am okay. Sometimes I am happy. Sometimes I miss him and I can still coexist as happy. That\u2019s my goal to work towards anyways. Sometimes I talk to him. I have seen signs from him. I have seen some really weird stuff from from (as has other people with me - that\u2019s another story). But now I don\u2019t feel or see anything anymore. After his wife (my grandma) passed away I didn\u2019t feel it anymore. That was comforting in a way. But nonetheless I still talk to him. Maybe for myself. \n\nMy issue now is describing who I have lost. Because when I say I lost my grandpa people usually tell stories of their grandpa who died and it\u2019s not the same. Not only did my grandpa raise me but he is the only person in this entire world who has never done me wrong. Not once. Not ever. Never. And then it feels wrong to say I lost my dad because my actual dad is still alive and I still love him. It\u2019s hard to explain and exhausting. So I\u2019m hoping there are other stories similar to mine out there. \n\nAnd if anyone I know in real life is reading this and recognizes this hi.

I just lost my dog two hours ago while I was at School, here is my story. In 2016 i went to a RSPCA pet rescue center here in Australia for a school trip. The school trip involved understanding the process of adopting rescue dogs and for me personally the trip really got me interested in adopting a dog. \"huh a dog would be a good addition to the household'\" i thought throughout the day. After  a year of convincing my mum. (Who can't be convinced btw) She agreed to buy a dog for us. Throughout the year prior i had been nagging my mother constantly and because she had been sick of it she bought dog related items (Album of dog pictures, Blankets, Pillows... Basically anything dog related)  Which only fueled my dog obsession and because my Mum had been sick of the constant nagging she caved in and on my 13th birthday I received a dog for the first time. Chloe (The Dog) was a jack russell x corgi x cattle dog presumed to be 12 years and 5 months when we adopted her. Me and her were both very avoiding when we first met. I didn't talk and she didn't lick. I avoided her because i was disgusted by the fur, her teeth, etc... Like typical teenage fashion i wouldn't feed her either so mum would do everything for me, but eventually as time passed I became incredibly attached as we would sleep on the same bed together, go for walks, talk in baby-voice, etc... What was amazing about my dog is how, stupid she was! When i'd give her a bath she'd try to run away but because of her condition (Heart murmur and old age) she barely could run! Also when i took her out to my pool area in my house she'd flop into the pool by accident! (what a classic) Anyway around 5 - 4 months ago she began coughing violently in my room (flem was coming out) We took her to the VET and they diagnosed that she had a sensitive windpipe and so they prescript ed her with medication (Steroids) to relax and open up her wind pipe. She got instantly better. Until yesterday when she began coughing flem, i thought nothing of course (It'll pass.) I come home today and mum is crying, \"I am sorry but chloe has died\" I wasn't shocked but confused. I tried to call an animal ambulance but mum said that she was dead, with a Hard D. I couldn't believe it, i thought she had been drinking. I snatch her phone (my phone was dead at the time) and the internet is running slow. She eventually convinces me that she is dead and there is nothing to do. I eventually find out that she had been dead for an hour, I lose hope. I sit there and touch her and eventually conclude that she is dead and there is nothing i can do. I don't cry or feel sad, i feel voided and i had no emotions. My mum gets me a cold cup of milk and i sit there next to her for over an hour. She rings a funeral transport to take the dog to the morgue and i continue waiting. At this point i couldn't touch her, it felt disgusting, she was cold and stiff. So they take her body, put it in a basket, cover her with a sheet and put a flower on top. And that's the story of a chloe\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA wonderful loving, carefree dog. I love you so much little girl. RIP Chloe", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I am sorry I failed to see the signs earlier. I did not realize you were trying to tell me something, you still had the young cat vigor you had when I met you 10 years ago. I never could\u2019ve guessed about the growth in your mouth. How I did not realize how very little you were eating. You were still drinking so much water that it did not alarm me. Then you drank less and less. Until one day, I saw you with blood foaming out of your mouth. I was so scared, I called the vet right away. She is such a sweet lady, you liked her a lot when you saw her. She talked about the growth, she told me about your lower kidney levels, told me all the risks, but she said you were not in serious pain, just discomfort from the food. You had lost 3 pounds since your 6 month checkup, I knew you were not going to have much longer left, but I wanted to have hope. When she called me the next day to talk about the kidney failure, I felt like the ground swallowed out from under me, I was still holding on to hope, but it was in vain. She said that we could try to do treatments and surgery, but it would be painful, very costly and would not give you much longer if the procedures worked. She then gave me the other choice, the peaceful death. She knew how devastated that made me, but she also said that if you were her cat, she would do the same. It made me feel a little better inside, she really liked you and she is a great professional. She knew the risks and knew it would be better to prevent you from all the suffering.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am sorry we did not have more time for me to spoil you a little more and give you everything you wanted. You mostly had stopped eating, the morning of, you looked at the broth and walked away, you kept going to smell you water and also walked away. I did not want you to suffer from hunger and dehydration. I love you so much and I hope that you know it. This has been the hardest, most difficult, decision I have had to make in my life. You were a part of me, a part of the family. I hope you understand. I am also sorry that you had to be in your own room when I was not home, you were so scared of the dog, I did not want to impose the stress of it on you. But I made sure that every moment I spent with you was a moment filled with love and adoration. You have changed me, you have helped me, you have grown with me, you were always there for me since I found myself living on my own, then moved to New York City with me. Life has been better living here even though there were ups and downs. I always made sure you had food and water and a clean litter box. You were such a picky little eater. If it was not your brand of foods, you were not having it, you slowly gave in to more brands, but it was so funny. You were so good, never asking for table scraps, not even interested in them unless it was cream cheese. I tried to give you some cream cheese on your last day, but it looked like it made you uncomfortable. I want you to know that I tried and that this was the best I could do for you because I love you and did not want you to be in pain any longer. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain, I am sorry I did not see the signs earlier and I am sorry that everything happened so suddenly. I love you now, always and forever. Please enjoy kitty heaven until I come to reunite with you. You deserve all the treats and cuddles the place has to offer. I am sorry you had to go when I thought you had so many more years, I was wrong, I don\u2019t think I could have done more than I have, but guilt settles in once you realize the companion you care so much for is now gone. I know you loved me and I know that from your kitty perch in the sky, you are looking on me with adoring eyes and wishing the best for me. I love you Toby. I will miss you so much, my heart breaks at the thought of a future without you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10 years ago, you chose me as your mom. I walked into the adoption center and you came scratching at the window when you saw me. It is true what they say, cats really choose us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSigned,\n\nYour mom\n\nWith all the love I can offer...\n\nThank you for highlighting the darkest days and making the sun shine even brighter on the best ones.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Her passing brought back old feelings of grief around the passing of my mother (also cancer). Feeling sad and anxious, I called my brother to talk about it. I told him that these kinds of events make me scared of getting sick and worried that I am not doing enough to look after my health. He started to tell me a story about this Tilly hat that my mom had given him the year she passed. Seems like a silly thing ...to pass on a hat to someone but this hat was something she wore on every adventure, every sunny day and it saw her happiest moments. It had her name written into the top with marker. That name eventually faded but my brother knew it was once there and thought of it and her every time he put it on. This summer, his dear hat and precious gift started to really fall apart. He stopped giving shoulder rides to his daughter because he was afraid it would rip more. He wasn\u2019t sure if he should keep wearing it on his adventures because he didn\u2019t want it to get more damaged. There is a big hole between the brim and the actual hat. It\u2019s in tatters basically. He told me that he actually struggled with whether he should replace it or keep wearing it (it all seems trivial, I know). Finally he decided that the hat has a life-time guarantee and he\u2019d call the company to see if he could get a replacement. They said yes - so he went for it. He told me this story because he wanted to illustrate that my mom gave him a hat. Something functional. When it no longer functions, it\u2019s no longer a hat. Don\u2019t keep an old hat that\u2019s not even a hat. He said I get why you are scared but don\u2019t die of cancer before you die of cancer. Life is precious but don\u2019t live preciously. Go out and appreciate it while you have it instead of worrying about that old hat and whether it\u2019s going to get even more damaged.

I'm just starting to uncover the topics that still need closure. I'm beginning to get a sense of what my emotional and phsychological inheritance is, the interpersonal legacy that he left. With those insights I'm working to unravel the enigma of our relationship which I had written off as superficial but now understand that the complexity reveals that he was a flawed human being like we all are\u2014but now I can see that I'm not to blame for his behavior and so then the basis for some negative self narratives have been nullified. Simply put ,\u201dit wasn\u2019t about me,\u201d Not at all. There was a great distance between us that I never acknowledged. That un-acknowledged distance and a few other factors that I won\u2019t go into are what held up my initial grieving.\n\nStill, with all these freeing insights, I can hardly cry in the privacy of my own room. Yet I only get the urge to cry in public because when I'm around people who care about me and see my struggle I realize for a moment to that it's ok to not to be ok.  Right now I'm wrestling with some preconceived notions of what society expects of me.

He lost the battle to addiction after seven years of being a drug addict. \n\nAdam had the best laugh. It was loud &amp; boisterous. He was tall, handsome, daring and charming. Eight years my junior, I grew up watching him come into his own. I remember him putting on magic shows in the living room. One time, he wanted to hold my hand on the roller coaster when he was scared. Adam wanted reassurance that he wasn\u2019t too old for that. As any big sister would, I told him of course it was okay.\n\nAs time went on, I grew to be the worrier of the family. Adam grew up to be a total daredevil. Jumping off the Stratosphere in Vegas, flying a hot air balloon with my Dad, and living his life in the fast lane. \n\nMy brother was the kind of guy that grabbed life by the horns and stared fear in the face with a smirk. I used to think of him as a cat with many lives because no matter what happened, he always came out of the situation unscathed.\n\nHe became a drug addict slowly, but with warning signs. In the end, it seemed like he was overdosing every other day. The calls from rehabs and hospitals were relentless. The year before he died, my parents got a call from California encouraging us all to fly out there. He overdosed and his numbers were horrible. In this dark time, we all prepared to say goodbye to him. Miraculously, he landed on his feet yet again. \n\nThis time the overdose had consequences. He passed out on his hands and this caused serious nerve damage. He couldn\u2019t use his hands for a while, but with his first hand surgery he acclimated quite well. The doctors said his hands wouldn\u2019t recover and that the damage was permanent.  After about six months, he started to get movement back in his hand and to our surprise, were told he\u2019d make a full recovery. I remember him sending me a video of him moving his hands. I sat there in awe, crying happy tears.\n\nSurely, this will all make him wake up and stop using, I thought. I hoped. In times like this, hope is the only thing that really gets you through. Every time something catastrophic happened, this was my mindset. \n\nWe never quite got the whole story, but I knew things weren\u2019t looking good. He seemed to be spinning faster towards danger and I felt angry that there wasn\u2019t a damn thing I could do to stop it. \n\nIn the year or so before he passed away, my friend Kate who had lost her Dad to alcoholism, told me to prepare myself for the worst. She said she had wished she accepted the fact that he could die before it happened. Maybe, just maybe, if I could do that, it would help me in the long run. I reluctantly took her advice. I sat down in my office and really thought about what she said. I cried for what felt like forever.\n\nThis harsh but valuable insight from my dear friend helped me beyond words. Every time I saw my brother, I acted as if it could be the last time. This has brought me a great amount of peace looking back on things. I don\u2019t have regrets of what I could have done, because I know for sure I tried everything. Tough love, soft love and everything in between.\nOf course, none of it worked so there is a part of me that feels defeated. Who am I to impart any wisdom on others? \n\nThere is great peace in being able to look back on things with a clear conscience. I never looked at addiction through rose colored glasses. I saw it exactly for what it was no matter how difficult it was. I remember begging on the phone to his rehab not to let him out because I was worried he\u2019d overdose and die. I was told there was nothing they can do to keep him there. It was his choice to leave. I\u2019d be on the phone from morning to night fighting for answers.\n\nI spent hours talking to him about his addiction, trying to understand it and help him in any way I could. I suggested everything I could possibly think of and was there for him anytime he called me. I\u2019d take his calls even when I suspected he was high. Sometimes he\u2019d make no sense and ask for money. Other times, the Adam I knew and loved was just calling to say hi. I never missed one of those calls. \n\nMost importantly, I spent as much time as possible with him and always hugged him extra tight before I left. I told him how much I loved him and cherished every second. If I had not done this, I know for sure I\u2019d look back with regret. \n\nSomething I wasn\u2019t prepared for was how permanent death is. \n\nHe flew home from rehab in California and I saw him the day before he died. He was back in town to get surgery on his other hand. I remember him standing in the driveway on my way out. I told him again for the millionth time not to use, especially before or after his surgery. He agreed not to and I told him I loved him. We hugged and I got into my car. That was the last time I saw my brother. \n\nI wanted to write this open letter to anyone that will read it. To those who are suffering with addiction and the families around them, please know that you are not alone. I grew up in the middle class. We had a nice house on a cul-de-sac. We were taught to love each other. No one would have expected what was going on in our lives.\n\nI want to share a few words of wisdom I have learned along the way. Take it as you will.\nTo those of you in the beginning stages of grief\u2026 hold on. I know you feel like you\u2019re drowning and can\u2019t catch your breath. You will breathe again, I promise. In the beginning, my family took everything ten seconds at a time. I cried for months in grocery store lines. There were long periods of time where I woke up crying and I went to bed crying. I could hardly catch my breath. \n\nPlease, hang on. We had an outreach of support from friends and family in the darkest time of our lives. I encourage you to reach out to those that love you and let them take care of you when you need it. \n\nCry your eyes out. I used to hate crying until I realized how healing it is. Let\u2019s be honest, I still hate it, but I can recognize its undeniable benefits. To process grief, you have to feel the emotions behind it. I promise, you won\u2019t cry forever. Crying is good for you and is so incredibly tiring. Cry yourself to sleep, bring tissues everywhere you go and allow yourself to feel whatever it is you\u2019re feeling in the moment.\n\nTo anyone suffering with addiction, please know you are loved and you are not alone. I want you to know that losing a family member to this is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do. It\u2019s been a year and a half, and I still cry every single day. Please, do everything you can to take the addiction seriously and to get support in any way you can. \n\nAddiction is something a person is suffering with. It does not define who they are. It\u2019s easy to judge an addict until you have walked the same path. Offer kindness and love to the addict instead of judgment. That addict is someone\u2019s family member or best friend. All I\u2019m saying is, love goes a lot farther than judgment. As humans, we are all suffering in some way. It makes the world a much better place to offer encouragement, love, and understanding to a person. \n\nTo families and friends of addicts, I see you. I know how painful and hard it is to watch someone you love go further down the rabbit hole. It\u2019s a hopeless, devastating feeling I wouldn\u2019t wish on anyone. I try to openly share my story with others. You would not believe the amount of people who are dealing with the exact same thing. We feel like we need to hide in the shadows because it\u2019s embarrassing to discuss. Trust me, I get it. Please remember, none of us choose this. It\u2019s something that unfortunately happens way more than it should. \n\nTo those reading this, thank you for taking the time to listen to what I have to say. I miss my brother every single second of every single day. Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I can still hear his laugh. On the really tough days, that gets me through.\nAnd to my brother Adam; fly high. I will never forget you.\n\n- Allison", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Literally in the blink of an eye. That is not just a saying or a quote for me, it's reality. On his way home from work, 4:24 in the afternoon my best friend,  my fiance, love of my life glanced down for one second and wrecked, he was killed instantly. It does not give me comfort that it happened quickly, maybe someday that fact will but not today. The past 2 years have been a blurry fog of empty days. Passing by so slow but yet sometimes seems too fast. \nI am on my first vacation since 2012, at our family home on Nantucket Island. This old but charming house has been in the family for nearly a decade, not sure of the exact time line. It took me up until a few months ago to even begin to consider the idea of doing something for fun, what does that word even mean anymore when you are being torn apart by the confusing, crushing weight they call grief. But I went and my soul is a little bit lighter than when I left home in Virginia. Daniel was supposed to come with us on the next Nantucket trip, I think that fact made this that much harder to muster up the courage to do. I smiled, even laughed, and I meant it. I didn't have to force those muscles to do what is usually quite simple. This post doesn't really have a direction, I apologize for the random if you've taken the time to read all the way through. \nGrief has no conception of time, space, anything. I carry it with me everywhere I go, my heart has a constant ache that I'm afraid will never go away. Where there was great love there is great grief, no truer words have been spoken. But anywho..... I am thankful that I came on this family trip, even though I'm secretly terrified to return home, back to my \"new normal\" routine. Also excited, because even though it's just a stone in the ground and Daniel is everywhere, I still take comfort in my weekly visits to the graveyard, and staying with my mother in law as often as I can. \nThis is ending on a sorta jumbled note and I'm sorry again, I'm also getting back into the groove of writing. Something that used to be daily for me turned foreign after I lost half of my heart. I guess this is me jumping over that fear, or whatever it is that's been keeping me from putting my thoughts to paper (or keyboard, ha). \nIf anybody reads this (if anyone even does lol) that has lost a piece of your heart and needs to vent, or has any questions on my process of getting through (though everyone goes through it differently obviously) don't hesitate to message me. I joined this to read other people's stories and experiences, and to hopefully connect with broken souls like myself and maybe just maybe help someone or get advice for myself?

The funeral was yesterday. \n\nHis health had been declining for a few years, due to Parkinsons/Dementia. He's been on palliative care since April 2018, and hospice care since July 2019. When he started palliative care, the visiting nurse told me she estimated had had about a year left. I was shocked! I knew he was declining, but it seemed slow. At the time he was still walking without assistance (although he should not have been), living at home with my mother (although both should have been in personal care by then). Then he went to the hospital with low blood pressure and dehydration around June 2018. Close call, but he bounced back to his baseline. In October 2018 he was hospitalized for over a week, for what turned out to be sepsis resulting from an unknown UTI. He was close to death at that point but eventually improved enough to be discharged. By then, I was convinced that the palliative nurse knew what she was talking about. This UTI/sepsis bout left my dad too weak to walk, too uncoordinated to eat without making a mess, and with shockingly severe verbal aphasia. \n\nHe and my mom (who has Alzheimer's - another story/another time) have been in a personal care facility ever since then, and I've been intellectually prepared for the inevitable. Two months ago, his PCP and palliative nurse discussed hospice care with me, and I agreed. September 3 they called to tell me that dad had taken a serious downturn the previous night and that he was probably close to the end. We were able to say goodbye to him while he was still responsive. Early this past Saturday morning, he took his final breath. \n\nThe past year has been exhausting at times. I did have some crying moments yesterday just before the funeral service, but managed to rally for the eulogy, held it together at the cemetery, and ever since then. \n\nToday, only one day after the funeral, I am definitely aware of this loss, and I feel lots of sadness when I'm with my mother because she is understandably sad. But, for now I feel like I've done all the crying I'm going to do over this. I'm telling myself that this is because I've been preparing for this inevitability all year long. Yet I can't help wondering if I haven't sufficiently grieved. \n\nTL;DR -  I feel bad that I don't feel worse about my elderly father's death following his 1-1/2 year-long health decline.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

She loved going to concerts and seeing live music with her friends. She never wore makeup her whole life, including her wedding day. She didn\u2019t need it. However, she did like to wear funky eyeglasses like cat eyes or just oversized styles in general. For the majority of my childhood , she had long hair that grew well past her bum.

She was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer on May 15, 2018. She had had a pain in her side for 6 months, was losing weight, and was fatigued. She saw three doctors who blew her off. Finally, she became extremely short of breath and could not even walk down the hallway of her condo building. I persuaded her to let me take her to a care clinic (NO ER--she refused). When they put her chest x ray up on the monitor I almost fell over. I work in health care so I can read x rays--the right side of her chest was white--severe pleural effusion. No one would look me in the eye, so I knew. They sent her by amo to the nearest ER, where a CT confirmed a huge tumor in her lung. Subsequent tests showed metastasis to her spine and possible brain lesions. \n\nShe wanted to try chemo, which surprised me. She had always said if she were ever diagnosed with cancer, she would refuse treatment. Her oncologist was not straightforward with her. I was. She wanted to know, and I told her that it was highly unlikely that she was going to live for longer than 6 months. I explained that this was palliative chemo only. \n\nShe pretty much gave in to her illness. She put on her nightgown and went to bed, and she never got up again. I think one time she put on clothes. She had a chest tube that I had to drain every few days. My dad was not much help. He was overwhelmed and began to show signs of anxiety and vagueness. He could not hold a conversation. I had to repeat things over and over to him. My brother checked out. I was pretty much on my own here. I do have a cousin who helped me--she was my refuge (we are like sisters). \n\nThe pain of watching my mother die is indescribable.  I would go to her condo every day and lie in bed with her to do my work (I was freelancing at the time--I'm a medical editor). I guess I am grateful that I spent so much time with her. But she ceased being my mom on the day she was diagnosed. The roles reversed abruptly. I was now her caretaker.\n\nOn September 10 she was told that the chemo was not working and that her tumors had doubled in size. We called in hospice. Her sisters visited her on the 12th. On the 13th, she started actively dying. I stayed up with her all night to give her morphine and ativan. She had attacks where she couldn't breathe. I believe that she was probably drowning from fluids in her lungs. When she had these attacks, she would panic. I soothed her as best I could and started giving her more and more morphine.\n\nOn Satuday morning, I decided to help her to the other side. She was unconscious, but I started talking to her about our childhood dog, Bridget, whom she loved like another child and who died in 1982. I told her Bridget was waiting for her. She woke up--looked at me--held my hand--I kept talking \"Go to Bridget. She is waiting for you\"--and then she died. \n\nI won't go into the fact that during this time, my cat died of lymphoma. Or after her death, her sister, my godmother, decided that she wanted to die too...severe COPD, no children, so I became her caregiver. She died on May 24. My cousin's mother now has dementia that's getting worse. \n\nI am so tired of grief. I miss my family. I miss these women who meant so much to me. I feel alone. I'm 55 years old and I can't seem to feel any hope for the future. I go to acupuncture--my therapist is wonderful. She asked me last week to try to daydream...to try to think of the future. I have tried and I can't. \n\nNext week I have an appointment with a grief counselor. I know I need to speak to someone. Meanwhile, I am supporting my dad through this, and my brother. I want OFF this ride. I want my mom back. I want to talk to her and get her advice. I am the strong one, the responsible one, the one everyone leans on, and I am so very tired. \n\nThanks for listening. I just needed to get this out today.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Worrying that every new pain in my knee, or bone ache in my leg is cancer. Worrying that that unexplained bruising pattern is indicative of a cancer.

Happiness when I find someone who \"gets it.\" Happiness when I find someone who understands why I worry, understand why I make sure that they have sunscreen on, or are well fed and hydrated. Someone who gets why I have to make sure everyone around me is as safe and happy and okay as they can be. \n\nIt means a great understanding of the fragility of life. Life can go at any time, for whatever reason. When your times up, it's up. So you may as well do that thing that makes you nervous. Eat new food, try new things, but don't be stupid about it. \n\nIt means a better understanding of who is worth keeping in your life. The friends who care about you. Who know how hard some days are. Who check in, that make sure you're okay.\n\nGrief is a multifaceted response to a loss. It's a weight on your back, and a wind pushing you forward. It's bad. And it's good.

Frankly, there are times I wish I could have been there to see him die so at least it would be real.

First off, even if you were his friend, the way you're acting is disrespectful. Second, HE'S OUR FUCKING FATHER! We are GRIEVING! And IN SHOCK. You KNOW his death was sudden.

He also introduced us to video games early in our lives and is the reason they're so important to me.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, my uncle moved to the other side of the country. It was around this time I learned he was having issues with drugs and severe mental health problems. We would talk on the phone almost daily to keep up with and support each other but I also began to progress in my own life and had less time to talk to him. He would make me feel really guilty about this, and eventually I realized how codependent our relationship was. I was basically the only person in my family who would talk to my uncle, and he took advantage of that. \n\nAfter a few years, he started using again. It became very apparent as he would call and text me almost constantly and it was negatively affecting my mental health, work and my other relationships with family, friends, and SOs. It made me physically ill from stressing out. He refused to admit or acknowledge his drug problem, and I became fed up. I told him I loved him, but if he didn't attempt to get clean that I could not have him in my life as it was not my responsibility to be constantly struck with worry and I needed to progress in my life and I couldn't if he was blowing me up and depending on me every day. Then I blocked his phone number and cried myself to sleep because I felt guilty for essentially abandoning him, but I needed to take care of myself.\n\nMonths passed, and eventually I got a call from my mom early in the morning. She told me my uncle was found dead in his bedroom. We eventually came to learn he died of a drug overdose. Obviously nobody was alongside him when this happened, nor did he leave a note explaining why he was doing what he did. I was told he looked incredibly frail, amongst other things about his physical appearance as I couldn't go to the other side of the country for any services for him. \n\nI don't know how to find closure. \n\n\nTL;DR: My uncle and I were very close, but I cut him off due to his drug addiction.

He even got fired for stealing when it was that he actually forgot to bring something from work back (beginning of the symptoms).\n\nMy mom also had to move away to live with my sister as I just didn't have the room or means. She is still in the US thankfully. I am struggling everyday since the walk at 3am at the hospice house after getting \"the call\". Walking down the dark hallway and making the first left turn to find him motionless with a carnation in his hand. I see this image everytime I close my eyes. \n\nNow I live in fear. I am afraid of going to bed at night because I know I am one day closer to the next tragedy. I don't want to live through something like this but I know it's inevitable. Once I manage to go to sleep, I then don't want to wake up because that's another day closer anyway. Time really is a bitch. I fear someday my wife will pass, my sister will pass, my mom will pass, and I will be left so alone. How long is the pain supposed to take? And the fear? I hate that everyday, I am one day farther away from seeing him. And one day closer to losing someone else.\n\nI feel like I was finally able to be normal, have a life here, a girlfriend (now my wife), parents and a job. Now, my mom moved away, my sister moved away, and my Dad moved away indefinitely. And I feel guilty for even feeling this way since now I may have it better than most and I should be happy but everyday is a struggle.\n\nSorry for typos, typing all this on a phone is tough.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He served for 8 years and then left to be a firefighter (the fire fighter thing is true, but exaggerated, apparently idk anymore).\n\nWe had discussions on the emotional toll the people he killed had on him and his attempts at therapy.

He put in two good hours and took a break. He was chatting with the guys while resting, being his normal funny, British self. I could hear him the distance chatting away. The next thing I know, some of the workers are yelling for help. I run up and find my dad collapsed and struggling to breathe.\n\nI called 911, and then he stopped breathing. I performed CPR on him for nearly 10 minutes straight. It may have been the hardest thing I've ever done both physically and emotionally. CPR is awful to perform. I had a really hard time giving rescue breaths as directed by 911 dispatch. It was difficult to hold back my gag reflex. I fear that and the cracking of his sternum will stay with me forever now. As well as the uncertainty of whether or not I did enough... The paramedics said I did a great job, and that a lot of people can't even start CPR. I'm not sure if that is just something they say or of it is true, but it did help.\n\nI'm not sure what tomorrow will bring emotionally, and I'm kind of afraid to go to sleep and what my dreams will bring...\n\nIf I were to seek grief counseling, which I am highly considering, what should I look for in a therapist?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I\u2019ve been toying with this idea to name my daughter (if that\u2019s what I have first) after my dad who recently passed to cancer. \n\nBack story: my family had this tradition of specific initial orders. Guys would be RKV and girls would be KRV, but all the guys would go by their middle name. So it was essentially a bunch of K names. I was named after my granddad but he was still alive at the time. I really thought the whole concept of being named after my grandpa was cool since I am a girl. But I\u2019m hesitant because my dad died recently, and I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll be filled with sadness because I\u2019m still grieving my dad and it\u2019ll just remind me of him. (I say recently, but it\u2019s been a year. It feels like yesterday though)\n\nHis name was Kristopher but he went by Kris. I think Kris would be a great girl\u2019s name, but at the same time, I\u2019m worried about being sad.

Deeply depressed and suicidal at 22.", "author": "plur3131", "self_text": "OK so this is my first attempt too vent and tell my life experiences. I mostly putting this out their because I feel it will help me to vent and write it all down. I don't have really anyone too talk too about life issues. When I was young I moved around with my single mom alot. She was a kind woman and would always put others before herself. But like me she had low self esteem. Going from boyfriend too boyfriend. I feel she always needed to be with someone or she didn't feel loved. My mother was loving but not perfect. She got addicted to prescription pills at a early age due to having her gallbladder removed at 16 and the doctors fucking up when they stitched her back up and left a piece of clothing. So for years she was in constant pain. I would live off and on with her and my grandparents. I eventually had them take me back. When things got bad  me and her were homeless living from drug house too drug house. We were than living with her boyfriend who was secretly abusive too me. She didn't know for the longest time until she came home and I had a busted lip. And was badly brushed and beaten. One day she didn't come home for a few days. Her boyfriend got wierd and scary too me. At the time I didn't understand. Cuz he would give me baths before. but this time..... He started touching me more excessively. Then he would start to touch himself. Obviously I was young and didn't understand what had happened. He told me anytime he would beat me. Too not tell mom Otherwise he would force her to stay with him forever and hurt her. I started being scared of adult males and my grandparents could tell something wasn't right. I eventually told my mom. Not about the bathroom incident but him beating me and threats. She finally left his ass and we went back with my grandparents. For a good few yrs she did good. Shebwas going too school and got a job. She then started dating a new guy will call him bobby. He was actually a nice dude in the beginning and me and my mom happy. They ended up getting married when I was 8. It was good I had a family and by 10 I got a new baby brother. It was fine until bobby got bad on meth and was in and out of jail. My moms addiction was on a Rollercoaster she got on a drug called methadone. It was too help pill or heroin addicts wean off of opiates. My moms was on dissibility and foodstamps. My step-dad got fucked up all the time and just quit going too work. We eventually had too move because of this. We ended up renting a house from my grandparents until we found are own place. Around this time I always had too move around and start over. Or go back to a old school I went too yrs before. Around this time my mom was expecting a baby girl. However she had a early labor, I was young and connot remember why exactly but I think it was due to her substance abuse. I had birth defects myself being pre mature being only 2 lb 11 ozs. I was suppose too be in a wheelchair because I had a curved spine. But I did physical therapy until I was 4 yrs old. And was eventually able to walk just fine thank God. Sorry got off track but my mom delivered my sister however she died minutes later because her lungs wasn't full devoloped. My step-dad didn't have us show up till later because he was hungover. We eventually got are own place for ourselves again. Then one night I remember my mom picked me up from scouts and said we needed to talk. She sounded serious and scared. She said I'm sorry hunny but your dad passed away last night. I was stunned and had a roller-coaster of emotion. I said bobby??? Why what happened????. Then this is when things got all crazy she said NO sweetheart your real father. Will call him Luke. I then went from sad too numb. I didn't know him or really care. I got too. Meet him about 4 times if I recall but I was really young. He passed then I was 12 years old. My mother and step-dad then had their finally kid my youngest brother. Around this time is when it all went bad sadly again ha. I came home with my grandparents from a movie and both my parents were fucked up. My mom delirious and bobby fucked up tweaking or drunk. My grandparents took all us kids away and that's when my mom and step-dad wanted to separate. Like always my mom  wasn't perfect but I loved her. she always talked to me and was my rock. She did good again building back her life we were planning too go live with my mom's sister my aunt. Then Easter came my mom was in contact with my step-dad and decided for all of us to visit and spend The day. Not a good choice. Idk how it started but we were at my stepdads parents. And my mom and bobby left for a while. They came back obviously all fucked up. Bobby then had a altercation with his own parents and they ended up leaving. He was so spun out of his mind he said he wanted too die. He grabbed the kitchen knife slashing his wrists in front of me. We all of course panicked the fuck out. We got In the car rushing too the hospital. Cops followed us when we were speeding there. Things were fucked. He had surgery and cops found out they were on drugs. DCFS involved and my brothers had too go With them. I was able to go home with my mom. After that my mom and stepdad finally separated. My stepdad signed away his rights and  my mom. Fought for hers. My brothers would live with my aunt and uncle until my mom got her rights back yrs later. I was 14 and we had my brothers back my mom's got us a two bedroom apartment too live in. Sections 8 housing. It was nice to have are own place but my mom being a addict was surrounded by addicts. This is when her addiction too oxycoton,and methadone got the best of her. Her liver started getting bad and she was trading and going through her pills. Too weak she would be sick in bed and not be able too do anything. She eventually snapped and drove my brother's drunk to are grandparents. My grandma took Control and had us move back with them. She would keep lock of her pills and have too give them Too her.. My mom would then sometimes call friends and score pills. Till one day my littlest brother found her unconcious and not breathing we called a abbulance and she was able too be resuscitated. My mom. Had another wake up call and knew she needed help. She had a long term stay at a rehab. She did so good and I could tell she was happy. She had plans and wanted too help others. She was flawed. But like me had the biggest hears of wanting to help other even at are own expense. I tried too call her one day and we talked about 15 seconds. She said she was really tired and loved me and couldn't wait too see me for Halloween. Around this time we were living with my grandparents again. They had there youngest daughter my aunt with then too. They have 7 kids my mom. Was the second eldest.. There oldest child died in her 30s she has cerbal pullusy. My grandmother was in the hospital due to heart problems. We all planned too come see her until my grandpa got a call. This call changes my life forever. My grandma screaming on the phone and my grandpa trying to calm her down then after a few seconds screams NO and keeps repeating it. He looks at me and says with shock your mother's dead. I didnt know or really remember because I was in shock. How I reacted tbh. I just remember being puzzled and trying to understand what happened. I didn't cry or anything yet just felt numb and disbelief. I was 16 years old and now lost my other parent. My first best friend, my rock, My only mother and parent I had left gone. My brothers were 6 and 4 yrs old. their deadbeat dad still alive in Prison for the next few yrs. It's weird like It didn't feel real even after the funeral seeing her body. I cried and so did my brother. My youngest was too young to understand. But 2nd eldest knew mommy was gone. Thats when I fell off iv never been the same I feel as if a part of me was taken from me. And I have never been able too get it back. Just a empty feeling and pain in my throat. For yrs too come I would try too replace that pain but never able too do so. After that my safety net was gone I realized we are all Going to go and I questioned life and myself. I realized yrs later especially after graduating and not having parents be at your graduation that I lost something most kids don't at that age. That's when my dreams about her had stopped and the realization she's gone come more in minded. Then that's when I said fuck it I don't wanna feel pain anymore. I started doing drugs. I always loved weed. But that got into phycadelics and even more ecstacy, coke, GHB, Molly, codeine. I then got kicked out of my grandparents I was stupid and started dealing weed. I already knew about the drug game as a kid from my stepdad and my friends that taught me in high school. its how I made money Not saying I was right  but even working at a job and being kicked out I needed too pay my bills. I don't have a mom and dad too ask help for. I got off health insurance at 19 while. Having asthma which was not good And really hard for me. I ended up in the ER because of my attacks and have a few medical bills in collections for it ha. Next part of my life I'm 19 and I meet this awesome older couple that I met selling weed too ha. I call her My friend Hippy lady and her husband Johnny. We got close because hippy lady had pancreatic cancer and I would help make her oils for her cancer it helped with her pain. They even eventually had me rent out a room and live with then they became my good friends and family. It's crazy too say but I have alot of real family I just dont come around them . When my mom died and I got into drugs they all said they would be there. but when it come too it no one came around. And instead had alot of realitives talk bad about me saying I'm a drug addict and going too end up like my parents die by the age of 35. I'm not going to act like I'm a good person I fucked up alot. I was rude and pushed people away. I was heartless too my mom before she died and hated my grandparents. Understand when i was leaving with them I made bad choices. However even tho they let me live with them they didn't give me emotional support I couldn't talk too them about anything. They just didn't talk about feelings or anything. After my mom was gone I felt so alone cuz even tho I had parents figures. It just wasn't the same. I know they loved me and I lved them. But I felt like I never could have that parent connection they were just grandma and grandpa. They were strict Mormons who lost their kids and were stuck raising us. And honestly I felt bad and a burden. When I got kicked out it was more me leaving cuz I felt bad being around my family doing what I was doing. So Living with hippy lady and her husband. I was working and had a chance too do good. Obviously I fucked that up and didn't idk why I get majorly depressed. I do good work on goals for a few months then slip and start getting high not caring. I quit my job got stupid and starting dealing. Didn't last long until I got caught up. Dont get too comfortable kids and start selling too anyone even if it's a old high school friend. Some of them like to be criminal informants for the local police department. I got a felony charge and put on Probation. First offence I got no prison time and was able have my charge reduced too a misdemeanor once I successfully complete probation. After that I had too pull my head outta my ass. I moved back to my grandparents and got a job. Got sober and started too work on my goals again. My dear friend hippy lady started too slowly slip as well. I would go with her husband to Colorado too get her medicine. Cannibis oils. She was one of the few good things that happened too me in my life. She passed when I was 20 years old. When I was still dealing with that months later my grandma had a seizure and ended comatose in the hospital. Tuned out she had a tumor. She eventually woke and surprisingly ended up OK considering the circumstances. The doctors gave her a month to live and concidered chemo. She didn't believe in medicine like that and said No. The craziest part about this is they did some research and decided too use cannibis. Even being religious my grandma asked me too help get her oils So I did. It helped her eat and not have pain when she walked. We knew she was going too get worse tho. She needed too move too a legal state too have cannibis without getting in trouble with the law. My grandparents and brothers moved to Nevada. Until my grandmother would pass. She said before she went. That she wished she could be here when I got married and had children. I was 21 years old when She passed. After this whole ordeal my grandpa beings the age he was at 70. Decided too sell his house. He got remarried months after. My brothers would go on too live with there aunt and uncle again. Who loves them very much. My aunt can't have kids of her own and has always loved them like it was her kids. I'm Happy because after all the bullshit they delt with. they finally had a stable home and a mother and father figure. As for myself now 22 Iv been working in a production plant for 2 yrs I make ice cream ha. It's gives me bennifits and I can pay my bills. I eventually went back too live with hippy lady's husband John. He didn't mind the company due too losing his wife two yrs ago. Plus having a five bedroom house too yourself gets depressing. His words exactly. This is now where I finally get too my point. I started getting high again just more stoned nothing major. But after all these years even tho I'm young. All my burdens finally caught up too me and made me realize. I'm not normal or right in the head. After getting in trouble yrs ago. I found out who my true friends were. And realized I'm not like them. I get jealous of others who have familys. I feel it's not fair and I don't know why I was even born if all I have felt was pain. In my life. I don't mean too get more Into this. But I feel like a damaged person. I don't know what love is or how to honestly accept it.. When you go through your life as a kid and have everything you love taken. You almost feel you don't deserve it.  Your never going too be loved.. No girl wants some damaged kid. Because of my sexual tranma im still a virgin. I have done forplay and oral. But I get high anxiety when it came too sex I feel Low self esteem and feel no one wants me. I had a girlfriend in high school but it was never serious. One of my friends sisters she actually one of the only girls I really loved. I feel in love with her and her family. Her and I became good friends for yrs. She had trouble of he own with drugs. She would act like she had feelings. And she would Say I like you alot. I just can't be in relationships. When in figuring myself out. We still flirt all the time even tho she has a boyfriend. she gets with these asshole drugs addicts. Then started getting back into it herself. After being sober for months at a time. Idk I know it's already a mess and mixed signals usually means she's not interested. But it's When she gets high with her boyfriend she acts that way. Then when she's sober. She will litterly flirt hold my hand and tell me she loves me???? Idk lol like I could be reading it all wrong. But fuck man the heart wants what it wants. I'm Not some dick head who wants too just smash. I actually feel like maybe I love her and her. I wanna be apart of her family and want something more with her. But it's hard too know when you never had love yourself sadly. Sorry I'm about at the end if you actually kept reading this far. I'm just at a point now where I'm really depressed I just feel so lonely and worthless. I just feel like if I don't find purpose in life will I ever be happy. The thing is iv always been depressed. But I'd be able too still be happy over things. Now.... I dont feel anything it's just numb. Idk if it was the drugs Molly especially or the trauma and anxiety. Maybe its burdens catching up with and not having parents. But im stuck. idk who too talk or turn too.. The girl I think I actually have a connection too. Probably will never know what she wants and end up hurting me in the process. I have no purpose I just feel like I'd rather be dead. I hate myself I feel regret. I blame myself for my mom and I feel bad I'm here and she's not. I was able too hid these feelings for yrs. But it's about over. I didnt think about killing Myself because I would hurt the one thing I love left. My baby brothers. My moms death ruined me. I couldn't imagine what mine would do too them. They are the cutest kids man I see my mom In them...... You see tho now I'm at the point where I'm depressed everyday. I honestly don't have joy anymore I feel like a burden. I feel like a coward and a victim. I'm sorry about the poor me attitude. I'm Not trying to gain any sympathy. I guess what I wanted too ask anyone that is still reading this. How does the pain go away.... I'm sorry but no matter what I do how many drugs I did Or things I enjoyed or goals I try and set. I just feel this pain deep In My heart. That will never go away . I'm at war with myself and convince myself I don't deserve too be alive. Im agnostic myself. But I will say when we do go from this world. If the pain I feel finally goes away it will finally give me relief. Until then I'm in my own hell. I feel no girl or family will love me. Mostly because I don't love myself. If you don't have a family and are alone. Is there really a point in life with no love. With no parent or lovers warm embrace.....thats what I'm hoping too figure out.\n\nThanks too anyone that took the time too read this. I was close to a mental breakdown today. I just needed to vent. This had been a struggle in my mind for a long time.  Last thing I didn't wanna mention anyone's real name. That's why I used fake names. I hope anyone that can relate In a way gets through this hard life. Whatever happens I just wish too feel love again \ud83d\ude14. \n\nPs...

But it's hard wanting something like that from someone who is undoubtedly still hurting. \n\nBasically my biggest issue is his lack of patience for our daughters we have a variety of ages and does a little better with our oldest, but she's not around much but the younger ones tend to get snapped at for seemingly minor infractions. \n\nHe wakes on his own schedule and does his own thing most of the time ignoring us and the fact that I'm getting 4 kids off to school until it's time to say goodbye each morning. Then he will 'chill' around the house until it's time for work, usually taking a typically 2 hour nap. He heads to work, I finish work, I get the kids usually drive them by dad for a kiss, make dinner, do homework, clean up, get everyone ready for showers or bed whatever etc. Then wait for him to come home. I head to bed about 10, prepared to do it all again tomorrow, he stays up for hours playing games or watching videos. \n\nWe both have 1 day off shared each week, Saturdays. I would think this is where he spends time with the kids, no he isolates. I usually take the kids and do my needed running around or leave the oldest 2 with him as they fair pretty well independently.\n\nTonight was the night I was going to broach the subject because on two different occasions today, he yelled at two of our daughters because they did something wrong. Except he didn't even yell at the kid who caused the issue never mind the fact that he didn't need to yell about it anyway. Then when it came time for bed (I'm more lax about specific times on Saturdays) we were horsing around in the living room (he was again on his Xbox in the back of the house) he got tired of the noise and came up stomping around and yelling at everyone to get ready for bed and then being extremely impatient about how long it was taking (3 little girls to go potty, brush their teeth and head to bed).\n\nAll in all I don't think he's a bad parent I think he's just going through depression (he IS being treated), and really hasn't accepted the grief that's really caused this 180 in parenting. So id like to know others' ideas for helping me to help him become more aware of what's going on. \n\nTL:DR husband lost Mom, Grandpa, and Grandma within the last 3 years, and has since become an absent parent. Need help to help him accept that things are different and we need to approach parenting different.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

Few days later she told me the story. It's horrible. He had a totally out of character drug related accident the night before her birthday, and she was the first to find him passed away when she came looking for him. Her father was on the phone at the moment, listening to one of his children cry over the other. He was only 22. He was her best friend in the world.

Thing is, I've never lost anyone, or been in the inner circle of support for anyone who has. I'm kind of surprised she was out looking for a relationship right now, but again what would I know. I hate to make it about me, so that's kind of why I'm addressing it here. I feel like I just walked into this very sensitive time in her life when wounds are fresh.

I almost feel like his name isn't mine to say, you know? We've gotten close fast and had some long nights of opening up to each other but still. This is very new. \n\nOn the other hand, she's very intuitive. I don't want her to pick up on my hesitance and think the topic makes me uncomfortable.

I can\u2019t wait to move out of this freaking apartment. Then I maybe won\u2019t feel this horrible feeling every time I walk in. Day or night, but nights are worse. Because everything else is the same. I enter, I turn on the light. I take off my shoes outside of my room. I throw my purse on my bed.\n\nBut I don\u2019t look for Dani. I don\u2019t call her name. I don\u2019t have that stupid routine interrupted so I can pet my cat. I don\u2019t leave my room after throwing my purse, calling Dani\u2019s name. I don\u2019t wash her bowl out. I don\u2019t fill her water. I don\u2019t either get her food from my room, opening a new can, or retrieve the one from the fridge. She isn\u2019t meowing, excited for that special food.

She\u2019s not climbing on me as I browse Facebook or play a game on my phone. She\u2019s not gently biting my arm, trying to get me to pet her. I don\u2019t try snuggling her. I don\u2019t give her goodnight kisses and scratches and pets.\n\nI don\u2019t wake up, soon to be laid on by a cat. I don\u2019t give her forehead kisses. I don\u2019t pet her ears, probably one of her favorite kinds of pets. I don\u2019t delay getting up because she\u2019s laying on my chest. I don\u2019t wake up early just to give her love. I don\u2019t say bye to her most days. Or any days. I don\u2019t stop at the store randomly to buy her more things.\n\nI don\u2019t feel that warmth filling my chest as I realize just how much I love her. How precious she is to me. I don\u2019t look forward to seeing her adorable face. I don\u2019t plan to buy her the best cat tree for my next apartment. I don\u2019t need the lint roller for my black uniforms so much anymore.\n\nI loved everything about coming home before. I\u2019d rush home, be less willing to stay late. I had to see my little kitty. Give her love. \n\nI hate my bedroom. Where we both slept. Where I\u2019d lay in bed, practicing poor sleep hygiene. Where she\u2019d lay with me. Where I slept next to her for the last time. Where I held her paw, thinking about how adorable it was and how I should take a picture of it soon. How I needed to take more pictures of her in general, because I\u2019ve been busy lately and haven\u2019t been doing so.\n\nI feel like I should have known something was wrong. She broke her tooth and I blamed her eating less on that. But I brought her to the vet. I had pain medicine and antibiotics and a tooth extraction was going to be scheduled. If something else was wrong, they\u2019d know, right? So I don\u2019t understand. She was only days away from being thirteen months old. She was supposed to stay with me for so much longer. When I finally called to ask if I could find out what happened, it was too late. Things change after, and they wouldn\u2019t be able to determine what it was. So I\u2019ll never know. I did everything I could to make sure everything was going well. She was getting better. The night before, she followed me into the kitchen as I got her food, almost like before.  She was closer to normal. Everything seemed BETTER. Then I came home from work, searching for my baby. I took my time, too. Then I saw her, feeling the fleeting feeling of panic where I worry that something\u2019s wrong. But it wasn\u2019t fleeting. I placed my hand on her fur, my fears increasing, only to feel cool fur. Cold paws. Her mouth slightly open. And then everything became kind of hazy, but I remember the realization dawning on me and the feeling that I can\u2019t describe right now. Over an hour later, I held her, wrapped in a blanket, on the stairs. As my dad tried finding parking, I genuinely believed that she was warm, that there was a pulse. It all lifted for a moment, even as the rational side told me to stop. It was my arm. The blanket was fleece. \n\nWhat did I do wrong? Did I not make sure she was eating enough? Did I not tell the vet the right symptoms noticed? Did I miss something? Did she get into something? There has to be something that I could have done. She shouldn\u2019t have- this shouldn\u2019t have happened. \n\nDani was a cat. The best little cat. She was my baby kitty and I want her back. More than anything else in the world, I want her back. I can\u2019t accept that she\u2019s really gone. I often believe that she\u2019s going to appear next to me or something, despite knowing otherwise. The receptionist even said that they first verify that the animal is, you know... gone. But that\u2019s a faint voice in the back of my mind. Because Dani has to come back. I don\u2019t know how to handle this horribleness that I feel. So it has to be not real. It has to be some horrible nightmare that won\u2019t end. I need to wake up to her loudly meowing because I\u2019ve slept far too long.\n\nI feel like I shouldn\u2019t be enjoying life. Like my life shouldn\u2019t continue on happily. I shouldn\u2019t enjoy my upcoming vacation. I shouldn\u2019t be happy about my crush on a guy being mutual. I\u2019m trying, and the excitement is there, but the guilt and sadness winds its way through. \n\nMy sister took her food bowls from my room after finding out that I couldn\u2019t do it. I think she tried getting to the cat litter, but my room\u2019s been messier than usual since I got really depressed (which Dani helped me through), then got busier and busier. Not being able to clean without crying doesn\u2019t help.\n\nI got her a litter locker that arrived the Monday after. It\u2019s still in its box, placed in the closet. Her scratching board as well. A toy that made me cry, too. Her food, both soft and dry, are still sitting in my room.\n\nI gave her one of my blankets to take with her. It\u2019s really soft and I know she\u2019ll love sleeping on it, if the afterlife exists. (And on that note, I don\u2019t even believe in a single place we all go. I chose to believe in reincarnation. It\u2019s how I dealt with the idea of my own mortality and it\u2019s amazing. I want to be reincarnated. People say that I\u2019ll see her again later, but I don\u2019t believe in what they do.)\n\nI think I\u2019m done now. I cried lots, but my thoughts are finally out and not on Facebook, where I worried that I was bothering my friends. \n\nThis is all really disorganized and long, and I\u2019m sorry.

You were lying and cheating to be with her. Heck, you were downright creative and cliche all at the same time. One regret was not reaching out to her when you died. You may have been the last person he loved. Plus it would have been helpful to know if the missing money was given to you since I was getting blamed for it. But I digress.\n\nAfter 12 years you were tired of me, \u201cresentful,\u201d was the word you used. All we still had in common was our business. The kids; my kids, your kids, were pretty much grown and you didn\u2019t need my help in raising yours anymore so I wasn\u2019t worth as much. \n\nWe fought, a lot. We did couples counseling. Expensive couples counseling, you made sure to remind me. I was asked the question, \u201cwhy are you putting up with his behavior?\u201d \n\nAnother project was needed to divert so we remodeled. It was expensive. It was frustrating. You became even better at being dismissive of my feelings. \n\nYour adult kids were putting you through the ringer that summer more than usual. Seemed every week there was another fire to put out. The stress was ridiculous and the month before the world shifted you had to call the police to our home because your son was being abusive to you and out of control. That same week you had to report your daughter to child services because your grandchild was being abused. \n\nI thought you would crumble under the weight. How right I would be. We spoke about his lack of a will. I begged him to make one because I needed to know what he\u2019d want me to do. We weren\u2019t married. He told me he didn\u2019t want his kids to get anything, that he was ready to kick his son out and the other two would blow through everything. He said he wanted me to have all of it, the money, the investments, the house, vehicles, all of it. I didn\u2019t want anything just a plan. He said he\u2019d get a will. He didn\u2019t. He ran out of time.\n\nThe last day I spent with you in the hospital - you\u2019d been there for 9 days - the doctors told you all the things you wouldn\u2019t be able to do anymore. No more driving. No more working. No more fishing. No more motorcycle. No stairs. No using a knife to cut your food. See he was on a high dose of blood thinners so if he accidentally cut himself he\u2019d be done. \n\nI assured him the business would still continue we\u2019d just hire more help. I\u2019d move his bedroom to the first floor. We\u2019d work it all out. \n\nRemember last Thanksgiving when you said you were done with lame holidays? Well we\u2019re going to rent a big cabin up north and everyone is going to come and celebrate.\n\nHe kept urging me to leave that day. He was worried about the business and our customers. I kept hanging around. I was waiting for him to tell me he loved me. He never did. \n\nThe next morning I was up at 3am to get the crew set up. He texted me saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I know you\u2019re up and taking care of everything.\u201d We joked around, he was funny. I was going to take a quick nap. I was exhausted. I dreamed of an outdoor carnival, there were so many people rushing around and I heard carnival music and saw a carousel. I spotted you in the crowd moving in slow motion, you had a black sweatshirt on with the hood pulled over your eyes. And I knew. \n\nI woke up and had to make a delivery when I got the call. You were headed for another emergency operation. I drove the hour to the hospital and I saw them wheel you into surgery but I was confused. I ran after you screaming, you were gray. The doors closed but someone came back and handed me a tissue. I couldn\u2019t even tell if it was a man or a woman. Later I learned that you had the first surgery which was quick but when they got you back to recovery you started hemorrhaging and they rushed you back, that\u2019s when I saw you. You were gone 14 hours later. I remember when the surgeon came to tell me what a fighter you were, yes you were still alive. The surgeons sneakers were splattered with your blood. I remember that. \n\nYou lasted 45 minutes and never regained consciousness. We all went in to say goodbye and your body was cold. You looked at peace though and I remember thinking you could finally stop working so hard.\n\nToday is 7 years since you\u2019ve been gone. You would have been 64. What a character you were, just bulldozed your way through life. \n\nIt was difficult to mourn him since sometimes I\u2019m not sure exactly who he was. His voice has faded from my memory. I rarely dream of him. I\u2019ve bounced from being broken-hearted to angry to sad to guilty, all those stages of grief. \n\nI tried to rebuild my life - I lost pretty much everything. I got married almost 5 years ago. No one was happy about that saying it was too soon. It\u2019s ok though cause I\u2019m getting what I deserve, we are divorcing soon. So have your party people. Maybe you\u2019re even laughing at my misfortune up there in Heaven, if that\u2019s how it works. \n\nI do like to imagine that he\u2019s in Heaven, on a small boat fishing, a cigar hanging from his mouth, cup of hot coffee and our beloved dog laying at his feet. Eric Clapton music in the background. Tears in Heaven was one of his favorites. \n\nRest In Peace.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

This was drafted on my phone \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f* \n\nWe met on Hinge at the beginning of May, I was not particularly excited about meeting him. It\u2019s so ironic now that I think about it, my coworker had to convince me to go on the date. I am so happy I did, we hit it off so well, our first date lasted for about..... 17 hours (after which I met his mom, sooo soon I know) and from there \"the rest was history\" as they say. He told me things about him, and I told him things about me. It was like being a teenager all over again. We would stay up late, having been on the phone for hours. Most of it was us just spewing non-sense at one another. We talked about anything and planned everything. He took me to my first concert this past July, when he met my dad. When we were out he was so kind and warm. He had such a hearty, laugh. He could make anything be ok, and it was, when I was with him. So incredibly cliche but it's true. He lived life so thoroughly, every moment we had together was electric, he was alive.\n\nAs time went on, work took over, trying to see one another got harder (he lived with his parents while renovating a home he bought that was a hour away from me and I didn't have a car) so we had to pump the brakes a bit.  We never made anything official, though we often alluded to it often. Truthfully I think we were both afraid, come to find out I was the first woman he had gone on a date with in 2yrs. Also of note, I had been divorced for 2 yrs, getting married at 20 and divorced by 23.\n\n There was good news; I would have a car before the end of the month! It had been about a week since we last spoke, which was odd but I had to tell him! Instead of just messaging him, something told me to check his facebook because he often went on weekend trips to the lake; that's how I found out that Griffin had unexpectedly passed at his (parents) home a few days prior.\n\nI reached out to his brother, apparently he had mentioned me because he told me that Griffin mentioned me often and was also a fan of mine. They had a memorial party for him that I was invited to. I went and I was so moved and happy to see so many people there. It was so overwhelming but I was happy to be in a place, surrounded by so many people that also loved him. \n\nI accidently ran into his mom, trying to formally introduce myself to his brother. I thought she was going to remember me as the girl who crashed at her house but she embraced me and kissed me and we just cried together. She told me about some of our misadventures (like me locking my keys in my rental car on our second date) that he told her about. She made sure I was able to meet his dad and they both informed me that they had paid for us to go to the concert. I thanked her for raising such an amazing person. \n\nShe thanked me for being a part of his life and she told me I'm invited over at any time, but this time she'll invite me in and we can actually talk. I saw her once after that. I compiled videos from the night of that concert, little snippets that feature him, put them on a flashdrive and took it to them on Labor Day. I'd like to reach out to her again, but I'm scared. I don't want to impede her healing process.\n\nNaturally I could have go on about \"he made me feel\" etc. etc. but fuck that because the truth is I'm hurting, confused and it is painful to think about. It's much bigger than me though. I'm sad for this world. I'm sad because he was only 28, and such a bright light but now he is gone. His niece, that he adored, his brother, parents, extended family, his friends. \n\nI AM SO eternally grateful, to have had someone so special, though it was for such a short amount of time. I'm angry some days. With him, with life. I'm judging myself and the amount of grief I think I should be feeling. I look at love so differently now because of him. I used to think it was direct, and clear. Now I see that love is more like a wave. It covers all, at least it should. He made sure I knew I owed no one nothing,not even him. He taught me how to live, I just didn't think I'd be having to do that without him, so fucking soon.\n \n\nSome days I still wake up anticipating a text, call anything from him. It\u2019s so hard. I think about him everyday.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My son is handling everything in a healthy and balanced way, my advisors in my PhD program are amazing and all super supportive, my friends and partner have surrounded me with so much love and even though I am truly grateful I\u2019ve been lashing out in my close relationships, really losing my temper and being mean and hurtful and I have moments where I am just so rageful.  My partner is amazingly understanding and loving but he doesn\u2019t deserve it and I feel awful. My emotions swing around so intensely and so quickly that I have absolutely no idea what to expect in any given moment and all people can say is hang on, it takes timmmme. Fuck time, I feel like I am barely barely hanging on and I honestly don\u2019t know how I am going to keep going, and I don\u2019t want to hurt the people around me. What are some healthy ways you guys have found to release intense emotions? I am in therapy and have a ton of support from my friends too, but it is still so much more than I can handle.\n\nThe second and most pressing thing that I really need help wrapping my mind around is the situation with my brother. He has been transiently MIA for years. He will go a few months where we can reach him, he feeds us lies about his situation, and then disappears for the next few months. Based on his arrest records that I find online when I search for him, he is homeless and struggling with substance addiction. Since this has been the norm for years I\u2019d gotten to the point that I am numb to it, when he would call I wouldn\u2019t even want to talk to him, but my mom always would, she had such an open and beautiful heart. He has finally surfaced again, I haven\u2019t spoken to him since last year, and he doesn\u2019t know about my mom, our mom, passing away. He says he will call tonight, and I am so so scared of losing my shit on him. Through this whole thing I\u2019ve grown really resentful of how selfish his lifestyle is, how absent he has been from our lives, and lost my perspective of compassion that he is suffering too. I worked really really hard to make a nice life for my mom and son, I was there to call the ambulance, and kiss her forehead before she went into surgery, hold her hand during her last days and be there as she passed. We\u2019ve been so close for so long and I am insanely grateful that we were. We would regularly express our love and appreciation for each other. I\u2019m the executor of her estate, planned and set up her memorial on her birthday, 6 days after she died, AND HE DIDN\u2019T EVEN CALL ON HER GODDAMN BIRTHDAY. I am so so hurt and so angry. And I will be talking to him at some point soon and I know that it will be hard enough to learn that she is gone without me dumping all my shit on him too. I want to be compassionate, I want to come from a place of love, because that is how my mom showed me to live. But I am at the absolute ends of my limits.\n\nPlease, if you have experience with learning from someone else that your loved one has passed, please tell me what helped you in that moment. I need to see things from his perspective if I can, I really don\u2019t want to erupt at him, I feel so justified, but I know the right thing to do is to be compassionate. \n\nThank you for reading, and letting me vent, and for any help or advice you can give, this community has already helped me so much and I am so grateful for all of you.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

And Danny and Chris were 2 and 3 but I don't know which one was older. I've only seen one picture of Danny. And I have Heather's ring. My dad gave it to me years ago. It's a tiny copper and turquoise ring. I don't know if she ever got to wear it but I'm glad I have it. There aren't any more pictures of them that I know of. My family doesn't really talk about the kids. It's too upsetting for my dad especially. I don't know any of their birthdays or middle names and I don't want to ask and upset my dad. But I wish I knew. It makes me sad that I never got to meet them and they didn't get to grow up. I wonder what they'd be like if they were still alive.\nAnd my aunt is dying. She's been sick for a long time and recently found out she isn't going to survive much longer. And she wants to be buried with the kids. She said that way they'll have someone to take care of them. I don't know what I believe but I really hope she can. I hope they're in heaven or something and I hope my aunt will go there too. Right now she's so depressed and anxious. I'm not sure what my religion is but I've been praying about her. Asking God to comfort her. Or praying to my grandfather who passed about 7 years ago to visit her and help her when it's her time. And I pray that she gets to be with the kids and that they're with my grandparents right now.\nI don't know how much longer but aunt has but they said she'll be gone by Christmas. I was kind of close to her but I haven't seen her much because she's been in and out of the hospital for months. I visited her a couple of weeks ago and it might be the last time I'll see her.

Lately I have I been more awkward than usual, and I had a realization that the whole infertility issue and the embarrassment and jealousy I felt along with it and then grieving for my mom and feeling like no one understood me had me pushing people away.

He lost his balance and fell head first down the basement stairs. The violence of his death haunts me. I nearly passed out at work when I got the call. He was set to walk me down the aisle for my wedding in June. He had been having balance problems the past year, but they'd given him treatment that was supposed to stop it from happening. He was supposed to have 10 more years with a new pacemaker. He was supposed to be there for my wedding. He was my best friend. I have his signature tattoo'd on my arm with his birthday and the day he died. He would be 81 tomorrow. He had such a young soul. My biggest regret is not calling him more often. We had such wonderful talks. He was an important man, he played so many roles in his life. He was a JAG officer in the air Force. He was a substitute teacher. He helped start FEMA as well as the national weather safety week in our state. He was valedictorian of his college. He was so fucking smart. He was a husband, a father, a grandfather and great grandfather. I miss him so much it hurts. At the funeral it was brought up every few minutes that I was the granddaughter who's wedding he was supposed to be at, just reopening the wound. He was so fucking excited. We had planned for years. The worst part is him and his wife had booked everything 15 minutes before it happened. I got his rsvp in the mail the day after he passed. Just to twist the fucking knife. And his voice. Oh my god. Think Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson. A voice to make you stop in your tracks just to listen to it. I miss it so much. \n\nThank you to anyone who's read this far.\n\nIt might seem like a weird thing to grieve but I also lost two cars in the span of 4 months.

Fought like a champ. I was in prison for most of it. When I got out I wish I could say I spent every moment I had with her but I didnt. I hate myself for that. All the she would be proud of you now's dont mean anything to be honest. I almost made my dad miss being there with her when she passed so I could score another bag of dope. I held her hand as she died. Told her I would be ok and she could go. God I was lying. I was high at her funeral. I was late because I was scoring another bag. Wasn't enough dope and booze in the world to make the pain go away, but could numb me enough to make it another day. When I finally got into treatment and got clean it all came back. I remember writing her a goodbye letter almost a year after she died. I hadn't gone to visit her grave site yet. I remember writing it with no problem. But god I remember reading it. 2 words. \"Hey mom\" and I was sobbing. Took me an hour to read a one page letter. My little brother was my rock when I was going through treatment. Called him every day. Tell him I wanted to leave. He would talk me out of it, and I would stay another day. 9 months of that. When i finally got out I would like to say I learned my lesson. I didnt I replaced the drugs with work. I was working 80 hour weeks. 7 days a week. See the thing I forgot. The most important thing. I wasn't the only one dealing with the loss of a mother. One night my little brother calls me. He was stationed at fort riley in the army. He calls me. His radio is on way to loud. En the nd by linkin park.\nHe says to me, \"I need to talk to you, I am having a hard time.\" My rock that helped me through nine months of wanting to give up. And I told him no. I needed to sleep I had work. He said Maybe we would talk again one day.  The other side of that story. Is that my little brother had also lost his mother. He didnt have drugs to turn to, or friends. My little brother drove his car into a cement pillar going 120 five minutes after I got off the phone with him. That was 6 years and 4 months ago.\n\nSee the thing is this pain inside me is like a fkn cancer. I have tried to learn from my mistakes and I spend as much time as I can with my dad. I have a family of my own now. But my biggest problem is that on the days I should be happiest the best of the days. Are the days I am the most depressed. They should be here. As the years have gone by I have found it harder and harder to go visit them. It's like my shame and guilt just keep getting worse. Tbh some days I am mad at my little brother and that makes me feel worse. Because I understand the pain of not wanting to go on. But he stole the out from me. I can't do that to my dad. I cant do that to my kids. Idk if that makes sense. Some days the only thing that keeps me going is I don't want to pass this disease of Loss to my children. \n\nI have been clean for 6 years and 4 months. I dont need the drugs to push away the pain anymore. Mainly because that pain is all I have left of them. And as much as It hurts me I treasure it. That sounds kinda messed up but it's just my truth. I miss them so much. The stupidest things trigger it. Music. Movies. Jones soda. I really needed to get this out. I have been bottling it up for a long time.

I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

It's like the finality of it all is constantly being shoved in my face. She's not coming back. In tandem, though, most people around me are very much moving into the stage where they stop checking up on me as much, are perhaps less sensitive about bringing up certain topics, etc. But I want to grab them and scream that, for me, I still cannot believe this happened and I am still very fragile. I've heard that the few months after the loss are often harder than the time directly after, and I feel like my grief is matching that pattern at precisely the time when people are expecting me to be \"stronger\" than I was three months ago. I am not the kind of person who likes asking for comfort, I can be shy and I do not like to dump my emotions on people. I'm just uncomfortable with that. I do see a therapist regularly and go to a grief group, and those are a big help, but I'm nervous moving forward with my grief in a world that seems to have very much \"moved on.\" \n\nAny advice or tips for handling grief and life in this period?

I knew my life would never be the same, but what I didn\u2019t know was that losing my dad would mean losing myself, and thus, being forced to embark on this rather uncomfortable journey of self-discovery and newfound awareness. I admit, I still get fixated on many details better left unsaid - pleading with him to hang in there and take another breath. Please Dad, take another breath. Take another breath. I remember his skin turn gray, and his eyes became lifeless, and without spirit. His grasp began to loosen as my brother fiercely preformed CPR, his tongue limp on the side of his mouth and saliva drooling.. all of this so horrifying to me, and once something I\u2019d avoid confronting at all costs - in a number of unhealthy ways. How could this man, my ultimate protector, who had offered me unfailing, unconditional love, whether through the bad times or good, be in such a sad state? Clearly, I\u2019m still writing this, I\u2019m not even close to being over it, nor do I think I will ever be. \n\nBut, have I made progress? Yes. The first 6 months, I was so afraid of the world, I only left to work temp, oddball jobs when I really, desperately needed the money, my therapist, the hospital (my mom has an incurable lymphoma) or the liquor store when I just couldn\u2019t take the replays anymore. I oftentimes went through 3-6 wine bottles a day at 110 lbs, and would cry myself to sleep, only to wake up with a lukewarm bottle next to me and, repeat. I lived with my mom because I couldn\u2019t afford rent, and had no health insurance, and really could care less about life. Doing every day tasks was a great struggle. I would read countless stories in North Korea and world suffering to realize my life really wasn\u2019t so bad (yeah, that sounds so fucking weird). I latched on to the first man that I could find, who ended up being a high level drug dealer, member of the drug cartel, and serial cheater (I got chlamydia and left it untreated unknowingly for so long that I got PID and could barely move for 2.5 weeks, and STILL stayed with him). I took whatever he gave me to numb the pain - pills, hallucinogens, anything. Every day was such an intense internal struggle for my mom and I, and the thought of losing my mom and seeing us both abuse drugs the same way is still something we don\u2019t talk about, nor will we likely ever. \n\nI remember writing down my goal was to stop doing ketamine every morning. It wasn\u2019t until then, that I mustered up the little inner strength to leave my ex-boyfriend and start to regain life and faith in the idea that there was light at the end of tunnel. I stopped doing cocaine, ketamine, and ecstasy cold turkey after going on month long bingers (I once took over 30 pills in less than 14 days). I went full-time at my little job and was promoted. I became a better, more valuable team-player with this newfound clarity. I met the love my life who has served as a mentor, positive influence, and someone who has pushed me to become the best version of myself. I now mentor homeless youth every week, hoping to just give back and see them smile as they face their hard times. I got a new job for a company that helps and empowers children with autism and their families, and on my way to making triple digits. I feel as though I am a walking miracle, and I so desperately wanted to be who I am today for as long as I can remember, and my father\u2019s death kickstarted the grueling yet so needed journey to becoming a powerful, mental warrior and genuinely good person to society. I love you dad, thank you for raising me right and being that angel every daughter needs in their life. I hope I make you proud. \n\nIf you, or anyone you know needs a friend, someone you can just talk to, reach out.

I just know it was because he was training to be a therapy dog and the emotional support was appreciated. My mom usually sleeps most of the day being a night person and also working nights at the time, I was worried he wouldn\u2019t be let out or fed regularly, I took it upon myself to do all those things and he eventually became attached to me. \n\nHe\u2019d follow me around everywhere. If I was walking around he\u2019d be one step behind, if I was cooking he\u2019d be laying in the middle of the kitchen floor, he\u2019d jump on my bed and sleep with me. The whole nine \n\nAt this point he was already 10-12 with Addison\u2019s disease (from what they told me he drank a fuck ton of water, peed a lot, and his weight would plummet when it got particularly out of hand) we didn\u2019t expect him to live as long as he did. My family would tease me about how \u201cwhat\u2019ll you do when he dies? No one will look at you the way he does!\u201d \n\nThey weren\u2019t wrong. He\u2019d look at me like I was the only person that mattered. Like I was a saint. I miss that. \n\nHe saw me through freshman, sophomore, and junior years,where my extra weight caused gossip around me. Saw me through a group of boys taking me in and treating me like one of them. Saw me through my first heartbreak with one of them and the subsequent rift it caused. And even saw me discover that I really love performing in a choir \n\nHe helped me deliver apple turnovers to one of the boys down the street, funnily enough this guy was scared of this gentle giant, who did nothing but nudge him for pets. \n\nHe saw me fail to get my license the first time and then pass with no error the next time. We\u2019d get fast food for the whole family and I\u2019d put my back seats down so he had basically the whole car to hang around in. I\u2019d jam out to sublime and sing to him while feeding him fries (his favorite). \n\nThat same summer of sublime and fries something went very wrong. He lost tons of weight, think 100 to 83 in a few weeks and switching between constipation and diarrhea, with a bonus of a wheezing cough when exerting himself. I took him to the vet where they SPECIFICALLY ruled out congestive heart failure and told me he was just sick, they gave me antibiotics and sent me on my way. He didn\u2019t get better. I took him back, they told me it must be a different area than the antibiotics were targeted for, so they gave me different pills and sent me away again. Still not working. \n\nI sat by and watched him stop eating dry food completely, we gave him wet food but that only worked for so long, we even tried fast food, and much more. He\u2019d just stop eating it over a day or two. \n\nI kept taking him back over and over again to no avail. It got so bad I could see his body physically pushing to beat his own heart. The last time I took him they finally realized it was congestive heart failure (after weeks of denying it was) and gave me heart medicine and other things to give him to help. I asked my mom if he was gonna get better, she said it\u2019s only really to help until his heart decided to give out. \n\nA few days after getting his new meds he\u2019d refuse to take them. I was so frustrated I tried shoving them down his throat, even then he wouldn\u2019t budge. And yes I felt horrible for even trying it and collapsed on the kitchen floor next to him crying my eyes out while he looked on. \n\nA few days later after putting him outside I noticed he just stood there drooling, he\u2019d never done it before. He looked so gone... like he was just barely hanging on. \n\nI brought him in and got him to lay on his bed, I watched him a bit before getting my mom and telling her it was time to let him go.  That was August second of this year. \n\nThis part is really hard for me, I\u2019m sorry. \n\nWe drove him to the vet, who\u2019d knew beforehand we\u2019d be arriving, I sat in the back of my car where it felt like I\u2019d just been singing Santeria at him and handing him fries, this time I was letting him go. \n\nHe didn\u2019t wanna get out. He held against the nurse who was trying to get him out. He didn\u2019t wanna go. That fucking tears me up knowing he didn\u2019t want to.  They took him to a room where they\u2019d set up a bed and blanket for him. My mom stepped out to grab my sister who had parked my car. They had me sign the euthanasia form right then and there. My name is on that paper. I personally signed my best friends life away. \n\nWe had the woman who gave him to us there, she would\u2019ve adopted him if we didn\u2019t work out. I gave her his therapy dog vest. She\u2019d appreciate it more than I could. They gave us a booklet and let us choose an urn with the labeling we wanted, I picked that out too. I asked for a paw print and ink print as well. They walked us through the euthanasia process and how there\u2019d be no pain or problems. \n\nHe passed away within 30 seconds\n\nWe sat there for twenty minutes, crying, talking about him, and just petting him. \n\n\nIt\u2019s been nearly two months now. I turned Seventeen and started my senior year not 14 days later. A lot of good has happened since then but I can\u2019t feel truly happy about it. I just imagine celebrating with him and I can\u2019t be happy. \n\nI\u2019m supposed to be getting a job and going out with friends because it\u2019s my big last year, but I feel so weighed down by what happened I go through the motions every day. I feel more volatile and moody, my jokes aren\u2019t funny anymore, and every moment of happiness drains away after I few hours. \n\nI feel so trapped and alone. I just want him back. I just want to be okay again. I feel so guilty that I did what I did. I feel like I did something wrong. Or if I waited another day he\u2019d be alive now. But I don\u2019t know anymore. I\u2019m so tired and lonely. I lost my rock who got me through everything. \n\nThank you for letting me share.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

They told us the situation was bad, and that immediate family should get there as soon as possible. \nWe received a few updates while making the 14 hour drive. That they were cooling him down to prevent swelling in his brain and that he was on a ventilator, but that his heart was beating on its own. \nMy husband could not stand seeing his little brother in that state. When we arrived at the hospital he broke down pretty bad and we sat outside the room for a while. \nThey warmed his brother, did a bunch of brain activity tests and determined he was brain dead and told us they did not think he would ever breath on his own. \nTogether, my husband, my SIL and his parents made the decision to remove him from the ventilator. No one but my husband was willing to stay in the room with him while he was passing. I stayed where I felt I should. With my husband. It was the hardest 20 minutes of my life. It was peaceful overall compared to the other two I have sat with. He never took a breath on his own. \nI knew my husband was struggling, but when we got home Sunday, after him having to drive the 14 hours back by himself (I had to drive my SIL in the car my BIL took down there), he had what I think was a very bad panic attack and he said since then he feels different inside.  Like something has snapped. \n\nMonday I got him in to a grief counseling appointment, and then the next day to a crisis mental health center.  The Psychiatrist cannot see him for several months, so they recommended we go to a regular doctor or the ER to get some meds for the anxiety and to head off depression. He was prescribed both. He has another appointment on Friday. He seemed to be dealing a bit better but still 100% of all conversation was about him missing his brother and the circumstances surrounding the accident. \n\nHe and I are the ones who also went and retrieved my BIL\u2019s belongings from the hotel he was staying at. Both this and sitting with him while he passed have created images and memories that my husband cannot shake. \n\nYesterday afternoon he went to bed and really hasn\u2019t been up or communicated at all with me. I am making sure he eats and takes a shower every day. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. Do I keep letting him sleep? How much is too much sleep? Do I go to work? I feel like I am doing him no good at all. I feel like I have lost my husband to his grief.  I am so incredibly sad for him and his entire family.  Am I overreacting because it has only been days? \n\nAlso, my BIL\u2019s wishes were no funeral or visitation of any kind. I know these were his wishes and I respect them.  \n\nCan anyone help me?", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

My parents are 200 miles from grandparents etc. \n\nMy Grandpa is currently laid in a hospital bed waiting to die. I'm at home with my nearly 6 month old baby and all he wants to do is play. \n\nPart of me wants to be at the hospital, or at least with my grandma close by but that's extremely impractical as I live so far away and my partner is in work and I have no one to watch the baby for me. My sister is willing to take me but I would have to take baby and that just makes it difficult for everyone as it means someone has to be with baby at all times and we can't grieve properly so as not to upset him. \n\nThen the other part of me doesn't want to be anywhere near, not until after anyway. I sat and watched my\n\u00a0partner's mum die just over 2 years ago and I don't want to go through that again. The difference is I quit smoking since so if I'm in the hospital I can't even get 5 mins that way. I mean no one would stop me going out for 5 mins every now and again but it's not the same. \n\nI have a wonderful memory from the last time I saw my Grandpa, he told me he loves me, which is a first and will stay with me forever. \n\nMy partner can't really help as he is in work and as I am still on maternity leave we can't afford for him to have any time off. Especially as it's not someone related to him and all that bullshit. His family would help but we have moved away from them and as my partner has the car I have no way of getting to them, not even adding in the whole last minuteness and that they have plans etc. \n\nI just feel lost. My Grandpa, for all his faults, is an amazing man. He would give you the shirt off his back if you asked him. He has been my biggest supporter my whole life and I don't know how I'll cope when he is gone. Not to mention the guilt of me not spending as much time with him as I probably could have done. \n\nHe is my mum's dad and we have always lived away from them, my dad was in the RAF so it was a given. My mums sister on the other hand has always lived 5 mins away from them so she has been the main carer. Her kids, my cousins, are there every other day. Sometimes I just feel they think less of us because we aren't there. \n\nI just feel so lost. I want to curl up in bed and cry but I have to look after baby who makes my heart swell with love and then I just break down crying again because I know how much my Grandpa loves him, how much my son would live him. He was only able to meet him once when he was about 1 month old, he's been in hospital since then and I won't risk taking baby to the hospital. \n\nI feel guilty laughing and playing with baby. \n\nI didn't expect this to be so long.

One of my chickens was decapitated by a raccoon. The fucking thing somehow got into their outdoor run during the day. I feel like everything I love is systematically destroyed by some outer force. First, I drove for 3 hours to buy four baby chickens of a specific variety that I had always wanted. I took them home and took care of them for probably two weeks before my mother's dog broke into my room and killed them all for no reason. He didn't even try to eat them, just ripped open their bellies and left them there. Later, I found one of them the dog hadn't managed to get, she was curled up in my shoe organizer. I held her for a long, long time before I put her back under the heat lamp. She ended up dying within a few hours of being found, I think it was the shock. I've lived in abject terror since the first incident. I didn't want any more chickens or anything that my mother's horrible dogs could easily kill. I was constantly terrified of my cats getting out of my bedroom. I should mention that these dogs have killed cats before. I guess a lot of this trauma extends from my mother, who disregards completely my sensitivity towards animals as she continues to cause me to be in these situations over and over again. She always runs to come make me deal with whatever fucked-up bullshit she's created. When the dogs killed someone's cat that got into our backyard when I was 15, she called me over to come clean it up. I vividly remember her throwing away the poor cat in the trash. After my chicks died, I told my mother so many times that I didn't want any more chickens even though she kept telling me that she would \"replace\" them. She went ahead and order me four new chicks off of some website and had them shipped to us ('which I am firmly against). One of the chickens turned out to be male, who are illegal to have in the city. I kept him as long as I could before I took him to my mother's to live, though I was very afraid to do so. Then I only had three hens, but the largest one started taking on the role of rooster and attacking the other girls, so I had to take her to live with her brother. I had the last two, my favorites, up until this incident. I had finally gotten comfortable enough to think about adopting them some friends when it happened. I'm not terrified again. I think about where my cats are all the time. I get up every 15 or so minutes to look around for them. Every time a door opens, I lose all the feeling in my legs and hands and I have to go make sure everything is ok. I'm so anxious that I am barely functioning and I really don't know what to do about it. The idea of my cat's safety seems entirely unattainable to me unless I am there to witness and ensure it. It's almost like my brain is broken. I'm incapable of not thinking that everything will go horribly wrong if I am not there. I guess I have trust issues.

But I'll try to keep it short. \n\nWhen I was 8 years old my dad was an alcoholic, he would not work, sleep on the couch all day with a 40oz battle in a paper bag and drink. I would leave for school and he would on the couch and when I came home same story. \n\nI was always told my dad was just sick. \n\nOne night I hear my dad crying downstairs for my mom to give him booze money. \n\nThe next morning I came down the stairs and said \"morning dad\", instead of \"good morning dad.\"  Like a bat out of hell, my dad just jumps on me (8) and starts choking me on the ground and my brother (9) and sister (11) try to pull him off of me. \n\nEventually he let's go, cleans me up and tells me not to tell anyone what just happened. I don't remember the walk to school but all I remember is my 3rd grade saying \"good morning\" to me and I just lost all composure and told him everything. I was brought to the principals office and they called my dad to ask what happened, he obviously didn't answer the phone so they called my mom and told he what happened. She was obviously frustrated at what she had heard. I don't rememeber anything to between them getting off the phone with my mom and that night at home. \n\nWhen my mom got home she and my dad started arguing. Me and siblings went into my sister's room and shut the door. We then started to hear glass break and my mom screaming. I ran down to the top of the stairs and yelled, \"I hate you\" to my dad and my mom ran upstairs covered in blood and we locked ourselves in my sister room. We called the police and my dad was arrested. There was glass and blood all over the living room. Me, my siblings and mom all went to the ER that night. \n\nFast forward to the custody battle and my dad never showed up. My mom wins by default. I have tried to contact my dad when I was 13. I wrote him a letter and he never got back to me. When I was in the Marine Corps I was visiting my dad's family in California and they got me on the phone with him. He told he was proud of me and my brother that we both enlisted in the Marines. (Today I found after he got off the with me, he changed his number)\n\n3 weeks before he died this Tuesday, I found out he tried to have me aborted but my mom convinced him out of it  \n\nLast night i went to look for a picture of me and him as a memory of him but I only found one picture of me and him when I was a baby and he had a look of annoyance. He never took picture with me. I was just a nuisance to him and for years I wanted to find him but having a career it's hard to do that. These past days I beat myself up about not finding the time to visit him but now I feel like he never found the time to visit me. I feel awful but part of my is glad he chose a 19 year game of hide and seek instead of being in my life.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I am 20.\n\nMy mom was diagnosed on May 24th, 2019, after countless arguments with the doctors insisting she had laryngitis. She had non small cell lung cancer (stage 4), a brain tumor that started at 5mm transferred by blood from her lung cancer, and cancer in the lymph nodes in her neck and chest.\n\nShe knew something wasn't right.\n\nWhen we found out, we all cried a lot. Everyone was scared. Things felt like they were spiralling, but it settled a bit.\n\nI, like many others, drove her to appointments and to get groceries and run errands. She had lost her license due to the tumor, as seizures were possible. \n\nShe had a major seizure in the pub on Canada Day (July 1st for my non-Canadian friends) and I listened to her screaming as loud as she possibly could in the back of an ambulance as they didn't have the shot to stop the seizure on hand. She came out of that okay, the seizures were caused by the brain tumor.\n\nShe had the tumor removed and the surgery went well. Unfortunately, she had been on steroids pretty much since her first small seizure, and she needed to stay on them to stop the swelling.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, steroids reduce swelling, but also drastically drop your immune system. Mom had been given her first shot of immunotherapy when everything went to shit.\n\nShe got feverish, started having major exhaustion and eventually my brother took her to the hospital to be checked out.\n\nShe never made it out.\n\nThe steroids had dropped her immune system too much and she developed an infection in her lungs. We were able to visit her on the tenth floor for the first week, and she was speaking, walking, and showering by herself. She was hooked up to oxygen as hers had dropped too low. I took her outside in the wheelchair with an oxygen tank hooked up to the back.\n\nThe last conversation I had with her was over the phone, and she told me not to come visit her. I had been cleaning the house all weekend and doing chores, and she wanted me to relax. I saw her the day before, but on situations like these, one day seems like forever. The hospital was an hour away.\n\nShe developed PCP, blood clots, and pnemonia in the second week, and she was sedated and paralyzed with a breathing tube down her throat. A different fungal infection came later, and her heart wasn't pumping as strongly as it should have been.\n\nAfter almost three weeks, the doctor said she couldn't recover, and her lungs had taken too much damage.\n\nSo we made the call to have her tube pulled, and I watched her die. I made sure she would be knocked out for it all. I listened to her suffocate and her breathing fade off into nothing. If you've been with anyone who's had a lung infection, you know the 'blowing bubbles into a cup of milk' sound I'm talking about.\n\nI couldn't look at her face. I stared at her hand, at all the little scars on it from a life of manual labor on a farm. I listened to my mother die.\n\nThen five minutes later I was on the phone with the funeral home making arrangements. \n\nI don't know how to get this out. I can't cry. I can't get mad. I'm not happy she's gone by any means, she and I were literally best friends. I just work, make money to keep the bills paid, do my chores, look after the animals, take care of my older brothers, and try not to look too hard at her empty room.\n\nI don't know how to process this.

The autopsy took so long, and there was a piece of me that was holding onto the hope that it was some freak accident thing. He had struggled with addiction for almost as long as I can remember, but he had been in recovery for 3 years. He'd had his slip ups, but he had just gotten his one year chip. He had a wife, and 5 children. He just had a baby a month ago. He was on the up swing in a way I had never seen.\n\nPart of me kind of knew it was an overdose. He died so suddenly and so young (he was only 29) that I think I knew deep down what had happened. But I didn't want to believe it.\n\nFinding out it was in fact an overdose ripped the wound wide open again. I finally was getting back to some sense of normalcy, and now I am lost all over again. I'm not angry at him. A lot of my family is, and understandably so, but I'm not. If anything, my heart hurts for him. I can't wrap my head around what he must have been going through.

I wish he had a normal life, that he graduated from high school like me, that he got to drop out of college, that he got to make the dumb mistakes I made and still have his life turn out okay. \n\nAddiction has been a huge part of my life. My dad, one of my sisters, and my only brother are/were addicts. They have all been in recovery, and doing so, so well. And I just can't understand why I got a life he will never get to have. Why didn't I become an addict? I've drank, I've done drugs, I've made stupid choices. Why him? Why did he have to suffer from this horrible disease? What drove him to use over and over and over? What kind of pain did he have to carry around? I just cannot imagine the shame and the guilt he went through every time he relapsed. \n\nI know this isn't how he wanted it to end. I know he didn't want to be an addict. I know he wanted to be better. He did everything he could to atone for his mistakes. He hated himself for the things he had done, and he wanted to make up for it in some way.\n\nIf I could, I would give him everything I have. I would go through what he did, just so he could experience the good side of life. I would do anything to bring him back, to give him the life I know he so desperately wanted. The life he deserved. \n\nEveryone keeps saying he lost his fight with addiction. And that makes my heart ache more deeply than I knew it could. He deserved so much more. And I don't know why I am left here, with my amazing life, when he never got to have the same.\n\nI miss him so much.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

He had a stroke last night in his sleep. When they were getting him to the hospital, the damage was already done. His brain tissue is completely dead near the stem so once he's off life support, he's going to be gone.\n\nI wish I spent more time with him recently. I constantly said no thanks to my mom when she'd ask if I wanted to go see him because I was busy. I feel awful for putting other things over seeing him when I'd always tell myself to never do that because you don't know when it'll be the last time you'd see them.\n\nHe's permanently asleep in the hospital and no one is there with him right now because we're waiting for all my other aunts to fly in so we can all see him. I'm hurting so bad because this is the first time I've lost someone so close to me. \n\nWhat hurts the most is that the last thing he posted before he went to bed was a picture of me. It hurts so much and I love him so much. I hope he knows that and I just can't handle this right now. I haven't even cried yet because I'm in denial and crying makes it real. My mom has been on the phone to prepare his damn funeral and I can't even describe how much it hurt my heart to hear. \n\nMy mom just had a double mastectomy and is starting chemo to make sure the cancer doesn't come back and now she just found out her daddy is basically dead? How do you even handle something like that? My mom has always been my hero, now more than ever. \n\nMy grandfather was the only solid male figure in my life, besides my older brothers. I'm so close to him, closer than any of my other cousins. They rarely visited him and it made me so angry that they wouldn't visit him. I know he loves me and always will but I just want him to be here with me and to be okay. I don't want him to leave me like so many others have.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}

I just can't stop thinking of all the things she's missing, of all the things she's missing out on, and how badly I miss her, still.\n\nThe worst part is probably the intrusive thoughts. I realized that there's a chance she was listening to music at the time, and I might listen to the same song and never know it was the one she died to, and that thought threw me for days.

Today I visited her in hospital and she was unresponsive. They said she\u2019s sleeping and may never wake up again. I told her that I love her so much and she nodded. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I kind of said my goodbyes today, I don\u2019t know if I can face seeing her again, but then I feel so guilty for avoiding it. My Nan is truly my best friend in the whole world. I spent a lot of time hanging out with her and my grandad (who passed away years ago) when I was growing up and I have such wonderful memories of her. As I got older we would have phone calls almost everyday, but now I\u2019m 22, I haven\u2019t really made as much of an effort in recent times. She always understood, because I have my own home and job and girlfriend etc but I\u2019ll never forgive myself.\n\nShe has also suffered badly with anxiety and depression her whole life. I have both of those plus borderline personality disorder (which causes intense emotions at the best of times), so we would always help each other through our shared shitty mental health. Who am I supposed to talk to now? We always understood each other perfectly. She was also always so understanding and accepting of me (I\u2019m a lesbian), and she was so pro LGBT of any kind. The world will be a darker place without her light.\n\nAnyway that\u2019s irrelevant, I\u2019m rambling. I don\u2019t know what to do. Part of me wants her to just go now because the waiting is awful... it\u2019s like I\u2019m grieving now but I can\u2019t fully grieve. I also am struggling to talk about it and be around people, I don\u2019t like my parents fussing over me and touching me and idk why.\n\nShe briefly woke up earlier (I had left by then) and told my mum she was ready to die. She is 79 and misses her husband and other family members so much, I know she is ready and I know she\u2019s suffering. But selfishly I\u2019m not ready, and I\u2019d rather have my Nan alive but chronically unwell forever, which i know is horrible. I just feel shattered, like someone has dropped me from a massive height and I\u2019m made of glass and nobody will ever be able to put me back together again. \n\nKnowing that I probably will never hear her voice again, or make her laugh, or hear her tell me how much she loves me is tearing me apart and I honestly can\u2019t see how I can possibly cope with this. Nothing has ever hurt this bad and I\u2019ve been dreading this happening my whole life.", "subreddit": "GriefSupport"}
