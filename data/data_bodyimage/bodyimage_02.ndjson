I\u2019m just...small. I do the best with what I have but it is so hard to find decent clothes that fit me well and I\u2019ve just opened that beast back up recently because I just started student teaching so I need to have more business-casual looking clothes, especially since because I\u2019m small, white, and blonde, I tend to also get mistaken for a 16 year old. So if I say one word when shopping, asking if they have a smaller size (because I\u2019m a XXS or 00/23-24) I just get laughed at. Like \u201caw sorry honey is that too big? You look like your drowning, do you need help?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m SO done with it. I understand that plus sized people have struggles and our cultures have gotten so good at accepting them and I\u2019m so proud of that. But... can we stop putting that negative energy on the small people? No I\u2019m not a child, yes I\u2019m small and I\u2019m trying!! I\u2019m trying to gain weight but I can\u2019t! It\u2019s not so easy. It\u2019s not something to roll your eyes at. My doctors say I\u2019m healthy but if that was the case then why can\u2019t I gain any weight at all? What is wrong with me??\n\nWhen people complain about being skinny they are NOT looking for compliments. They are simply complaining and you can let them complain. That\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t compare your frustrations, just let them complain. Offer reputable advise if you have any... but otherwise just accept them. Accept them and know that being skinny and small is painful. You don\u2019t get taken like a real adult no matter what. People try to walk all over you, and it\u2019s hard to keep fighting that. It\u2019s a battle. \n\nBeing skinny also physically hurts!! I have lots of back pain and the top cm layer of my skin on my legs is usually in pain because my little muscles just don\u2019t know how to support my body.  Exercising is absolutely exhausting even if you eat 3,000 calories a day!! And eating those 3,000 calories is also exhausting\u2014it takes me forever to eat and eating is a chore because I\u2019m always trying to make sure I have enough calories to spend doing regular daily activities. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do. I feel helpless. Don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m pretty or that I don\u2019t deserve pity because this has been my entire life. Kids asking if they can have my cake \u201cbecause I\u2019m annorexic anyways\u201d\u2014no I\u2019m not! Please. Just let people be people.

He has even asked me how much I weight and tried to guess it. although that doesn't happen so regularly anymore, all my life I've been getting comments from people that ended up affecting me.

For the past 6 months, I have been going to the gym and doing ab exercises, but in december, I pulled an oblique muscle (just a minor pull), but it still hasn't healed. Last year, I used to be a runner until a hamstring injury and after getting back into running, I was constantly injured. I love exercise, it's the one thing I crave the most, but my body just can't handle it for some stupid reason. the past 2 years, I had a slight problem with restrictive eating, especially because of the injuries so to prevent myself from an eating disorder, I started a low carb diet. the low carb diet is the only way I have control since exercise isn't reliable. I like the low carb diet because I can burn fat without exercise or restricting. I eat about 1700 calories a day. Every day I eat the same thing. A serving of peanuts with a yogurt for breakfast, almonds and celery for snack, a salad with a few strawberries and a serving of sunflower seeds for lunch, peanuts again for snack along with cucumbers, maybe a piece of 100% dark chocolate, and for dinner, some meat with veggies. \nI hate how other girls who are toned and skinny get to eat carbs and whatever they want while I have to eat the same low carb meals and snacks every day just so my stomach doesn't look completely horrible. The only thing I have control of is my diet, but I don't want to restrict and fall into the same old habbits. Since I can't exercise to be more toned, I have to eat under 40 grams of carbs per day to lose fat. I hope one day, I will have a toned stomach. ", "subreddit": "BodyImage"}

I have enough proof in my family that I am risk for both with genetics. That is an automatic. I am an hourglass muscular shape. When I was my lowest weight (135lb) age 22, I was still big.. size 10 if I was lucky. Over the years, I have gained weight because life caught up to me...mostly belly fat, since I have had children. I have had several massive surgeries. More or less, I have lived my life instead of worrying about my appearance. Now that I am in my 40's, my weight is the first thing mostly discussed by doctors and it is always the root of all cures. I have been working at this healthy life style choice for a few years now. It is a slow process. As a person who suffers from depression, anxiety, and ADHD, I am more concerned about my happiness than physical appearance. Another words, I have learned to take most criticisms of my body with a grain of salt. My husband thinks I am sexy, and personally, that is all that matters to me. I maintain good choices for my children so that they develop good habits. What frustrates me most is the whole BMI count, with your age, weight, and height. Physical images do not add up. I weigh 240 lbs. at 5'2, with a pants size in 18-20. My mother weights 230 lbs. at 5'1 with pants size in 22-24. How does this work out? I know the scales are accurate because we both used them. This has my mind blown about physical appearance and BMI. How does this add up? This experience has really messed with my head! Knowing the physical appearances of both my mom and myself, along with our weight differences, has left me feeling that I will never be deemed a healthy weight in the eyes of a doctor because I will never be 110-120 lbs. When I was 135 lbs, I was still heavy, with a little belly fat, my periods were off-sync, and I still suffered from PCOS. I was practically starving myself to get to that weight, and was not happy. When I was 150lbs, I was deemed still heavy for my height, but still skinny to me..size 12. My truly happiest weight where I felt physically comfortable in my skin was at 180lbs. I had just had my 1st child and I was physically active at a size 14-16. I really need fresh perspective from people who have found ways to love themselves and not get bogged down with health drama from physicians because of family history. I feel like to meet the physical form of healthy at my height, age, and weight, would require me to look like a deformed Barbie Doll. ", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I started taking antidepressants when I was 18 and gained a lot of weight (up to 165lbs) as a result of the medication. As soon as I came off of it when I was 20, I dropped to 130lbs. I have been this weight since then, and I'm now 24. I feel happy at this size and I think my body likes being this weight too. I eat pretty healthy because I'm studying nutrition and exercise moderately. I could definitely exercise more though, but I'm working towards that.\n\nThis issue is, every time I eat anything bad, my boyfriend shames me for it. He says I didn't exercise that day so I shouldn't eat that dessert, I'm going to get fatter, I won't be a MILF in the future, I've gained so much weight since we started dating, etc. He always calls me out if I eat something bad or if I don't work out as much as usual that week. I'm very in tune with my body and know when I need to make changes, so his shaming only insults me and makes me feel incredibly insecure. \n\nWhen I was at my heaviest (on antidepressants), I worked out 5 times a week with a trainer and ate super healthy and couldn't lose a single pound. He constantly talked about my weight and how I should exercise more so I can lose it, even though I was trying so hard. This resulted in really odd eating patterns for me and an insecurity around him moving forward. Now, when I crave something sweet, I eat it quickly when he's not around or hide it in my room so he doesn't see it. I'm ashamed and I don't need to be. I hardly eat bad, and when I do, I would like to be able to do so. I'm completely aware of my food choices, but sometimes you need to satisfy your cravings.\n\nHas this happened to anyone else?

In school there are rumors that I wear extensions and that I look like a hooker and that I'm \"fooling nobody with my colored lenses\" Ontop of that neither of my parents have blue eyes. My mom's eyes are green and my dad's are brown. Only my Grandpa's eyes are blue. Because of this I feel like I look nothing like my parents. My hair color isn't like my parent's at all- both my parents have brown hair. My natural hair is auburn like my Janou (dad's mom) but I was ridiculed because of that so I started dying it blonde. Anyway, because of this stupid unlikely thing there were a ton of rumors and still are about how my mom probably cheated on my dad and that I was a bastard (she did not!)

Following this he felt a lot better about it, he did some research about real penises for the first time ever and found my words to be confirmed, however as time has passed old intrusive thoughts have re-entered his mind.  \n\n\nHe is also very self-conscious about his body, he is fit, he goes to the gym every other day and does squats and his legs and bum are fucking ripped but he has a little bit of weight around his top which he says he expects on his current exercise plan but will get rid of before summer. However as good as I think he looks, he thinks he looks disgusting. \n\n\nIt has absolutely demolished our sex life to say the least, and on the other side I suffer with feelings that are diametrically opposed to his, where, when he doesn\u2019t want to have sex with me I feel disgusting and undesirable in my own body. As you can imagine its been difficult for me to rectify these feelings with his feelings of being unable to have sex because he feels disgusting and undesirable. \n\n\nAnyway, I love him, so I\u2019ve been working on my side and I\u2019ve spoken to him and taken the pressure off, told him that while I want to have sex with him, if he doesn\u2019t want it I won\u2019t push for it, but I asked if we could at least keep the intimacy, which we have and its helped a lot.\n\n\nWhile this does work well for now, I don\u2019t want him to feel this way about himself, its deeply disordered thinking and affects him in more than just the bedroom, so basically what I\u2019m asking is: what can I do to help? \n\n\nIf I vocalise my appreciation for his body, he takes it almost offensively, as if I\u2019m going out of my way to lie to him, which is hard for me because I just do it naturally, because I do think he looks good\n\n\nIs there anything I can do, or anything I would be able to suggest he does? We\u2019re at an impasse here and I feel like he needs professional help, but I think that is something he can neither afford of would pursue. \n\nTL;DR My boyfriend has severe feelings of low self esteem, but rejects any and all compliments, how can I help him change the way he seems himself?\n", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

A few years back I actually struggled with eating disorders and stuff like that and am finally at a place where I\u2019m working so hard to be happy as I am. I\u2019ve been seeing a therapist and working on things and I have been feeling so so so much better. \n\nMy problem is my partner, gorgeous tall skinny girl, makes a lot of comments about her own body in ways that then somehow go back to hurt me? I know she isn\u2019t aware of it, she\u2019d never do it if she knew it affected me but I still find it hard to hear. \n\nShe\u2019s recently got back from holiday and have been talking about how she\u2019s now \u2018very fat\u2019 because she almost has a belly, and I\u2019m sat next to her, thinking about my very existing belly and it hurts. \n\nI don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m allowed to be offended by this? She\u2019s never said anything to me other than called me beautiful and yet whenever she talks about herself putting on weight it makes me so sad about myself. \n\nI don\u2019t really know how to tackle this.

It's something that has always lingered in my mind, even to this day.\n\nHowever with the body positivity movement, encouraging everyone to love themselves as they are, I feel strongly that as a fat woman, I should learn to love and accept my body just as it is. I have definitely learned to love myself in my fat body as I've grown out of some of my insecurities and just by getting older, going to college, and also meeting other people who have similar ideals. Some days, I genuinely love my fat body! And feel a \"fuck it if nobody else likes my body! because I like myself and my body today!\" \n\n  \nBut of course, that isn't everyday. Losing the weight and becoming thin is something that I think is going to hang over my head for the rest of my life. My insecurities about my body are probably so deep seated, that in a sense it literally traumatizes me. My desire to be thin is too strong I guess. Basically, I ping-pong from loving myself in my fat body and wanting to be a thin person (probably because I don't actually? love myself in my fat body...idk).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I'm mostly wondering if any other fat people out there feel this. That strange paradox of feeling like you want to accept and love yourself as you exist in your fat body, but also having the desire to lose the weight and become thin one day. I tried discussing this with my therapist and she doesn't really understand it--she kind of poses it as making an either/or choice, but I don't really see it as so black and white as that? I don't really understand completely either...I'm trying to contextualize these feelings but I can't, so I would love to hear anyone else's thoughts on this, particularly if you're experiencing the same thing.
