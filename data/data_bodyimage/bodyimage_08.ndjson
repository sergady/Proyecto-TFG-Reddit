It used to be based around weight, at the beginning of my senior year of high school I was 218lbs and I've dropped down to 193lbs due to new medication and having to ride my bike to and from school, but in my mind I still look gross. My breasts are noticeably uneven and even after losing weight it's still the same, I've been thinking about getting them done but I'm afraid of surgery doing more harm than good. I get anxious about things and talk myself out of it easily because change is scary to me. I have some problems about not feeling feminine enough and it's gotten to the point that I feel sick when I think about putting makeup on or wearing different clothes because it feels like I'm a kid playing dress up. \n\nI'm worried it's affecting my relationship with my girlfriend. She's supportive of me and has made it clear that she loves me for who I am and any changes I make regarding appearance wouldn't bother her as long as it makes me happy. Despite that I feel awful when she let's me be little spoon or things in that nature because in my mind I'm too big to be it. Too clunky and wrong or something like that. My gf and my sister have both mentioned I could have body dysmorphic disorder but I've never gotten anything from a doctor confirming that or even have asked my therapist about it. My insecurities are deep rooted and have been around for a long time and it feels like they won't ever go away, and I know they probably won't ever fully be gone, I just need something to help alleviate it somehow because it feels like it's killing me metaphorically. \n\nIf anyone has any tips on overcoming this or how to not hate my body as much it would be appreciated.

I was there with my walkaround performance project ([theinsecurityguards.com](https://theinsecurityguards.com)) and the event that month was focused on Body Acceptance, featuring talks from Megyn Crabbe and my now-friend Harri Rose.\n\nI was so impressed by Harri; she was witty, self-effacing but not self-critical, warm and insightful. She was also honest about her own struggle with eating disorders, diet culture and self-acceptance. We got talking at the event and she's become one of my best friends. I love her to bits.\n\nSo, I hope it's okay but I'd like to tell you all about my amazing friend Harri's brand new book that came out yesterday: You Are Enough. It's small (pocket-sized if you have fairly big pockets), beautifully designed and illustrated (by @ashlukadraws), and full of genuinely really insightful, original and helpful advice and information about defying capitalist constructs of self-criticism and insecurity in order to accept and celebrate yourself, whatever you look like.\n\nYou can find Harri on Insta @harri\\_rose\\_ and her website is [harrirose.com](https://harrirose.com). You Are Enough is available at Waterstones in the UK and on Amazon.\n\nThanks!", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I was holding a lunch bag in my right hand and my phone in the other, I stopped to look at phone and was about to start walking again when I look up to see the man LEANED TOWARDS ME AND KISSED ME. I managed to duck so he only got my ear but the interaction got me shaking for hours afterwards. I have been catcalled before and the worst got as far as someone following me until I pretended to make a phone call. I told a few people about what happened and the vast minority were sympathetic but most of them didn't really know what to say to me. And I still feel shitty about it now.\n\nI care about aesthetics but it is not a performative act, it's a part of my ~~consumerism~~ personality. I only dress for myself and I follow a professional dress code at work. In fact, I was not even wearing anything revealing!!  I had on a cardigan and a sleeveless tank where I guess you can see a square inch of my shoulders on each side if I stretch (wow scandalous). I had wide legged black pants that couldn't even be any less sexy. I don't work in a field that focuses on exterior beauty but I have a lot of interest in makeup and fashion and I like taking the time to pamper myself. I sometimes feel like I'm supposed to be punished for wanting to enjoy makeup, picking out a nice outfit and going outside with God forbid some joy and confidence. \n\nI want to be safe (and my outfit was \"safe\") but I don't want to be harassed or assaulted! I don't even go out often and never go out at night time. I always tell someone where I am going and I take extra caution in crowded areas. Yet it felt like nothing can guarantee my safety and it's terrifying. It took me years, decades even to get my self-esteem here and I'm damn proud of myself. I just want to enjoy who I am without feeling threatened. I know I can't control other people's actions and that's what really sucks. I'm SICK of feeling scared of going outside and evaluating whether or not my outfits are \"too flattering\" or I look \"too pretty\" and slouching to hide my boobs!!! I feel like I've been made to feel bad for complaining about these types of encounters because women just need to \"working\" on something about their appearance all the time so this is just normal!

I found an old series that I watched back in 2017/18 called Dietland it only has one season and I connected with it because is about what we as bigger people go through.  From being bigger kids to full-figured adults people still, find ways to make us feel bad for our weight and just project their own insecurities onto us and not only that,  society has deemed us ugly and undesirable. We are portrayed like the butt of a joke over and over again in mainstream media.  When was the last time you saw someone bigger doing a serious role in a movie?  When have you someone doing a dramatic scene or acting their asses off on screen with a plus figure? Almost never, that has always rubbed me the wrong way. Feels like you have to have a flat stomach in order to evoke emotion to an audience and don't get the wrong idea there's are people like Kevin James, my favorite comedian Gabriel Iglesias, and Melissa McCarthy who have done it but they all had to start in comedy and build up from there.  Even John Goodman, one of the greatest actors of our days had to get stupid roles in his career before even got considered for more serious roles or action roles.\n\nFat people are constantly treated like the emotional punching bags or the comedic relief of the world at least in modern days we have  the body positivity movement  and at least they  are leveling the playing field by doing important work and creating a market for people who's waist  like mine is not a 32, that is beautiful.

I remember at 14 I was doing caplets for weight loss you know how dangerous that is at such a young age,  I did exercises, I walked, I ran every sunset and jumped rope in the morning just to please the eye of someone or in my mind I thought that I needed to burn fat in order to be treated like other men or even being deserving of love and respect.  We do so many things for society.  The same society that treats us so badly and corners us constantly.  A society that has kept our character hostage for so long.   We are so addicted to beauty standards that we evaluate someone by how they look before we even listen to a word that person says.  Even in the dating world as a fat person, you are forced to do poses and angles just so people think you are slimmer than you actually are. I read somewhere that women's first fear is a blind date is that their date is a rapist and men's first fear in a blind date is that their date is fat.  Being gay is no cake either, unattractiveness is viewed as an illness for the gays; some even say that being gay is only fun if you are physically beautiful.\n\nOver and over we repeat the same lies to ourselves.  Lies got stuck in our head like the latest pop song on the radio.  It's time to break the cycle.  Some of what we say is not even our own thoughts,  some of it is just insecurities of other people projected onto us.  We use it as a weapon against ourselves because in some fucked up way the worst we can do is actually love ourselves and be positive about our body.  The most offensive thing that we can do is actually in the eyes of society is actually liking what we see in the mirror and flaunting it so people can see that we are not an emotional punching bag, comedic relief or ultimately the butt of a joke. Maybe it's time we bring out the worst in us, maybe it is time that we show society that their worst is our best.  That even if they get offended, angry or disrespectful we are going to still wear what we like, we are gonna get out are we are gonna still kill the game. Because being bigger is just part of us not what we are.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

The other day I wore a shirt which I truly liked and the shirt made my nipples look hard as hell and being a guy with man boobs you always are self-conscious of that but in the same second I thought to myself I am no longer in high school, there are no bullies here.\n\nI bought this shirt with my honest and hard work why don't I wore it with pride? At that moment I knew I came so far from being a tiny fucking person to the man that I am now.  A man who's not afraid to occupy space anymore.  A man who loves himself not because of what's on the outside but for what's on the inside.  I think that is what they meant when they said:  It gets better.  With time you stop giving a fuck on how people see you or perceive you and you start enjoying life because this is a one chance thing only and no one should waste there time hating themselves.  Wear those jeans, use that shirt, buy that swimsuit and feel like the most beautiful person in the world why? Because society will make you feel like the garbage they will try to make you feel like you are undeserving of love and respect and that is not true.  Everyone deserve love and respect in this world no matter the size of the belt they use.  Stop believing the lies that has been told to you in media that the only reason that people aren't giving a fuck about you is because you're fat I've seen bigger people constantly falling in love and being truly happy because they know how to carry themselves and because they know that being fat is their asset, not their liability (for my accounting people out there)  If you are struggling with any type of dysmorphia or body issues disorder just know that you are not alone.  You are valued and you are loved. Reach out and look for like-minded people who are more than willing to help you it's not an easy battle but is a battle that with the right knowledge and work you can win.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

We spent a small amount of time talking about the cyst(which ended up in us scheduling a surgery to remove it) and the majority of my time there was spent listening to the surgeon harp on about my weight. Sorry if this is kind of rambling, I'm still really upset at how the appointment went.\n\nWhen the nurse was taking my blood pressure she went to her desk and got a bigger arm cuff and said \"I call this my curvy cuff.\" I have never EVER required a bigger blood pressure arm cuff, the regular ones fit me fine. She had to wrap this bigger one around my arm like twice because it was too big for me. \n\nAfter that I was brought into the examining room. The doctor spent maybe 5 minutes looking at my cyst and asking if I wanted it removed. After we agreed on a surgery date, she began by asking if anyone has ever talked to me about my weight. When I said no she then began to give me diet tips, telling me I should start eating more veggies and stop drinking soda/eating fast food. Little did she know, I go to my local farmer's market every weekend and load up on fresh veggies, I don't drink soda, and my husband and I eat fast food MAYBE once a month...which I ended up telling her. She then asked how I sleep at night and I said on my stomach....to which she replied \"oh wow, you're able to sleep on your stomach?\" She then said she would be right back and left the room. I sat there wondering what the hell any of that had to do with getting a cyst removed on my hand. She came back with an iPad in her hand....she looked up weight loss tips and how to deal with my GERD(which I've had since high school when I was 120 pounds.) She told me that it was entirely possible to lose 5-10 pounds before my surgery(in less than 2 weeks) so that I would be more comfortable laying down during the procedure.\n\nThey also repeatedly told me that they would have to do the procedure in their office under a local anesthetic instead of at the hospital where they can put me under because \"the hospital probably won't put you under because your BMI is too high.\" This was a weird statement to me because from what I've heard, these types of procedures are done in office without putting people under anyway. To me it was kind of a way for them to say \"see how difficult your weight makes things?\"\n\nTo top it all off, before I left the nurse told me I shouldn't get my nails done anymore because it's not good for me. Silly me, I thought I was going there to get a cyst looked at. Nope, turns out I went to get unsolicited life and health advice that had nothing to do with the issue at hand.\n\nTLDR; Went to a hand surgeon, scheduled surgery to remove a cyst from my hand, majority of the time was spent by the doctor telling me I'm overweight, making false assumptions about my diet and giving me diet tips, and then the nurse told me getting my nails done is bad for me.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

No matter how much love handles I have, how red or big are my stretch marks even how my manboobs are the butt of a joke by a few.  When I look in the mirror I see a survivor but more than that I see someone deserving of love, decency, and a good life. Whenever I feel down I repeat to myself all the bad things I been through always repeating one of Tess Holiday's quotes: No matter how big your waist is, everyone deserves respect.\n\nSorry for my grammatical and/or syntax errors.

It used to be based around weight, at the beginning of my senior year of high school I was 218lbs and I've dropped down to 193lbs due to new medication and having to ride my bike to and from school, but in my mind I still look gross. My breasts are noticeably uneven and even after losing weight it's still the same, I've been thinking about getting them done but I'm afraid of surgery doing more harm than good. I get anxious about things and talk myself out of it easily because change is scary to me. I have some problems about not feeling feminine enough and it's gotten to the point that I feel sick when I think about putting makeup on or wearing different clothes because it feels like I'm a kid playing dress up. \n\nI'm worried it's affecting my relationship with my girlfriend. She's supportive of me and has made it clear that she loves me for who I am and any changes I make regarding appearance wouldn't bother her as long as it makes me happy. Despite that I feel awful when she let's me be little spoon or things in that nature because in my mind I'm too big to be it. Too clunky and wrong or something like that. My gf and my sister have both mentioned I could have body dysmorphic disorder but I've never gotten anything from a doctor confirming that or even have asked my therapist about it. My insecurities are deep rooted and have been around for a long time and it feels like they won't ever go away, and I know they probably won't ever fully be gone, I just need something to help alleviate it somehow because it feels like it's killing me metaphorically. \n\nIf anyone has any tips on overcoming this or how to not hate my body as much it would be appreciated.

I was there with my walkaround performance project ([theinsecurityguards.com](https://theinsecurityguards.com)) and the event that month was focused on Body Acceptance, featuring talks from Megyn Crabbe and my now-friend Harri Rose.\n\nI was so impressed by Harri; she was witty, self-effacing but not self-critical, warm and insightful. She was also honest about her own struggle with eating disorders, diet culture and self-acceptance. We got talking at the event and she's become one of my best friends. I love her to bits.\n\nSo, I hope it's okay but I'd like to tell you all about my amazing friend Harri's brand new book that came out yesterday: You Are Enough. It's small (pocket-sized if you have fairly big pockets), beautifully designed and illustrated (by @ashlukadraws), and full of genuinely really insightful, original and helpful advice and information about defying capitalist constructs of self-criticism and insecurity in order to accept and celebrate yourself, whatever you look like.\n\nYou can find Harri on Insta @harri\\_rose\\_ and her website is [harrirose.com](https://harrirose.com).

I was holding a lunch bag in my right hand and my phone in the other, I stopped to look at phone and was about to start walking again when I look up to see the man LEANED TOWARDS ME AND KISSED ME.

I had wide legged black pants that couldn't even be any less sexy. I don't work in a field that focuses on exterior beauty but I have a lot of interest in makeup and fashion and I like taking the time to pamper myself.

It\u2019s probably going to take a lot more than a single moment to undo years of negative self esteem and body comparisons.\n\nBut it really made me think about it. What do I have to gain from hating the way I look? Absolutely no one is benefiting from my misery, especially not myself. Beating myself up for my soft spots and rolls is not going to \u201cfix\u201d them, not that they even need fixing in the first place. \n\nWorst case? Maybe I get a little bit sunburnt from exposing my legs in the sun. Maybe I decide to spend money on the clothes I WANT to wear instead of spending money on the clothes I think I should wear. Maybe I let myself indulge in that piece of cake that I\u2019ve been obsessing over for the past week and get a little bloated because, damn, sugar really sets my digestive system off.\n\nBut I can live with those things. I can\u2019t live with nitpicking myself and my self-labeled flaws. I can\u2019t live in fear of letting my future boyfriends/sexual partners see me nude (and if, God forbid, I hear a negative comment, I guess they aren\u2019t getting laid \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). I can\u2019t live with the constant \u201cugh, if only I looked like this I could wear those shorts\u201d.  I can\u2019t live with crying almost daily over things I literally cannot change short of drastic and wholly unnecessary surgery. \n\nSo maybe, next time when you\u2019re feeling low about yourself, ask yourself what would actually happen if you accepted your body for how it is.

{"post_id": "cqqnjs", "created_utc": 1565879732, "title": "Fatness attraction and dating.", "author": "jayharr9", "self_text": "Hello, beautiful people of r/BodyAcceptance,\n\nI came back because I found this subreddit very inspiring and you guys made me feel creative. I found an old series that I watched back in 2017/18 called Dietland it only has one season and I connected with it because is about what we as bigger people go through.  From being bigger kids to full-figured adults people still, find ways to make us feel bad for our weight and just project their own insecurities onto us and not only that,  society has deemed us ugly and undesirable. We are portrayed like the butt of a joke over and over again in mainstream media.  When was the last time you saw someone bigger doing a serious role in a movie?  When have you someone doing a dramatic scene or acting their asses off on screen with a plus figure? Almost never, that has always rubbed me the wrong way. Feels like you have to have a flat stomach in order to evoke emotion to an audience and don't get the wrong idea there's are people like Kevin James, my favorite comedian Gabriel Iglesias, and Melissa McCarthy who have done it but they all had to start in comedy and build up from there.  Even John Goodman, one of the greatest actors of our days had to get stupid roles in his career before even got considered for more serious roles or action roles.\n\nFat people are constantly treated like the emotional punching bags or the comedic relief of the world at least in modern days we have  the body positivity movement  and at least they  are leveling the playing field by doing important work and creating a market for people who's waist  like mine is not a 32, that is beautiful. There's a lot of work to do.  Kids out there that are still victims of bullying for being fat,  also being shamed and mistreated for not having the 'ideal body'.  I remember at 14 I was doing caplets for weight loss you know how dangerous that is at such a young age,  I did exercises, I walked, I ran every sunset and jumped rope in the morning just to please the eye of someone or in my mind I thought that I needed to burn fat in order to be treated like other men or even being deserving of love and respect.  We do so many things for society.  The same society that treats us so badly and corners us constantly.  A society that has kept our character hostage for so long.   We are so addicted to beauty standards that we evaluate someone by how they look before we even listen to a word that person says.  Even in the dating world as a fat person, you are forced to do poses and angles just so people think you are slimmer than you actually are. I read somewhere that women's first fear is a blind date is that their date is a rapist and men's first fear in a blind date is that their date is fat.  Being gay is no cake either, unattractiveness is viewed as an illness for the gays; some even say that being gay is only fun if you are physically beautiful.\n\nOver and over we repeat the same lies to ourselves.  Lies got stuck in our head like the latest pop song on the radio.  It's time to break the cycle.  Some of what we say is not even our own thoughts,  some of it is just insecurities of other people projected onto us.  We use it as a weapon against ourselves because in some fucked up way the worst we can do is actually love ourselves and be positive about our body.  The most offensive thing that we can do is actually in the eyes of society is actually liking what we see in the mirror and flaunting it so people can see that we are not an emotional punching bag, comedic relief or ultimately the butt of a joke. Maybe it's time we bring out the worst in us, maybe it is time that we show society that their worst is our best.  That even if they get offended, angry or disrespectful we are going to still wear what we like, we are gonna get out are we are gonna still kill the game. Because being bigger is just part of us not what we are.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

To be honest I feel the same way I love my body.  I love Every part of my body and of course, there are parts that I am not that happy but I accept them because that is who I am. Throughout my life, I've been through terrible shit my life has been a constant struggle.  From sexual violence, to losing all my belongings to a hurricane twice in my life my body has always been there and it is the only thing that I got and is the vessel for my soul why would I hate it?  Why would I go into the mirror and strip and say negative stuff about myself?  The other day I wore a shirt which I truly liked and the shirt made my nipples look hard as hell and being a guy with man boobs you always are self-conscious of that but in the same second I thought to myself I am no longer in high school, there are no bullies here.\n\nI bought this shirt with my honest and hard work why don't I wore it with pride? At that moment I knew I came so far from being a tiny fucking person to the man that I am now.  A man who's not afraid to occupy space anymore.  A man who loves himself not because of what's on the outside but for what's on the inside.  I think that is what they meant when they said:  It gets better.  With time you stop giving a fuck on how people see you or perceive you and you start enjoying life because this is a one chance thing only and no one should waste there time hating themselves.  Wear those jeans, use that shirt, buy that swimsuit and feel like the most beautiful person in the world why? Because society will make you feel like the garbage they will try to make you feel like you are undeserving of love and respect and that is not true.  Everyone deserve love and respect in this world no matter the size of the belt they use.  Stop believing the lies that has been told to you in media that the only reason that people aren't giving a fuck about you is because you're fat I've seen bigger people constantly falling in love and being truly happy because they know how to carry themselves and because they know that being fat is their asset, not their liability (for my accounting people out there)  If you are struggling with any type of dysmorphia or body issues disorder just know that you are not alone.  You are valued and you are loved.

My new ENT specialist and I spent an hour going through all kinds of tests and questions. At the end he off-handedly said, \u201cwhat is your BMI?\u201d and then figured it out for me while I said, \u201cI know it\u2019s high...it\u2019s in the obesity range...\u201d and then he started telling me that even if I lost 20 or 30 lbs. I would be in the overweight category. He then said that I should set my goal and not focus on exercise but, eat less than I expend, it\u2019s a simple math equation, etc. I play tennis very aggressively three times a week and walk 30 mins a day to work and back. I broke down crying in front of him because, I have felt bad about my body since I was 13 and in the last five years I have felt pretty good with my curves. I\u2019m 38 and it sucks to melt down in front of a stranger because, I feel so broken by the constant conversation in my own mind everyday about my body coming back in under a minute today. The rule = health isn\u2019t body image on this sub, so not discussing that aspect of a health professional\u2019s job here -- just sharing and knowing that others might have felt this way is why I\u2019m posting.

There are times when my (25M) partner initiates sex and I feel too awful about my body to go through with it. We have been together for almost 7 years and we live together, and so it's not like he hasn't seen me naked before.\n\n\nMy weight has fluctuated up and down since the beginning of our relationship and I sure am not as thin as I was before. Ive struggled with disordered eating in the past and am certain I have some form of body dysmorphia. On top of this, I have a very boyish-shaped body. I am very short, broad shoulders with no hips, butt, waist or boobs. I have some muscle but I'm certainly not shredded. My quads and calves are large for no reason (blaming genetics) and I struggle to find pants that fit properly. I try to take care of my body so I work out and do some cardio but I still absolutely can't stand the way I look. I end up wearing a lot of baggy clothes to cover myself up because I am so embarrassed, also because it's easier to wear oversized things than to find clothing that really fits. I recognize the body types and women he thinks are hot or beautiful and I am nothing like them.\n\n\nMy partner initiates sex often and there are times where I have to say no because I am feeling particularly ugly, ashamed, and uncomfortable in my body. He counteracts with comments like, \"I love you the way you are\" or \"I still think you are pretty\" and reassures me that he finds me attractive and comments on my legs. By this point, I am very conflicted and feel like I'm being lied to just to get in the sack. I know I have a high sex drive (especially with the current medication I am taking right now) but a lot of the time I need to say no because I am embarrassed and ashamed of my body. If I go through with it, you best bet I won't be having a good time because all I would think about is how ugly, fat, and unflattering my body looks from his point of view.\nI am very very frustrated and torn.\n\n\nHas anyone ever felt this way? What can I do to feel less like this? \n\n\n\n\nTLDR: I am too insecure about my body to have sex with my long term partner who has seen me naked many times before.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

We spent a small amount of time talking about the cyst(which ended up in us scheduling a surgery to remove it) and the majority of my time there was spent listening to the surgeon harp on about my weight. Sorry if this is kind of rambling, I'm still really upset at how the appointment went.\n\nWhen the nurse was taking my blood pressure she went to her desk and got a bigger arm cuff and said \"I call this my curvy cuff.\" I have never EVER required a bigger blood pressure arm cuff, the regular ones fit me fine. She had to wrap this bigger one around my arm like twice because it was too big for me. \n\nAfter that I was brought into the examining room. The doctor spent maybe 5 minutes looking at my cyst and asking if I wanted it removed. After we agreed on a surgery date, she began by asking if anyone has ever talked to me about my weight. When I said no she then began to give me diet tips, telling me I should start eating more veggies and stop drinking soda/eating fast food. Little did she know, I go to my local farmer's market every weekend and load up on fresh veggies, I don't drink soda, and my husband and I eat fast food MAYBE once a month...which I ended up telling her. She then asked how I sleep at night and I said on my stomach....to which she replied \"oh wow, you're able to sleep on your stomach?\" She then said she would be right back and left the room. I sat there wondering what the hell any of that had to do with getting a cyst removed on my hand. She came back with an iPad in her hand....she looked up weight loss tips and how to deal with my GERD(which I've had since high school when I was 120 pounds.) She told me that it was entirely possible to lose 5-10 pounds before my surgery(in less than 2 weeks) so that I would be more comfortable laying down during the procedure.\n\nThey also repeatedly told me that they would have to do the procedure in their office under a local anesthetic instead of at the hospital where they can put me under because \"the hospital probably won't put you under because your BMI is too high.\" This was a weird statement to me because from what I've heard, these types of procedures are done in office without putting people under anyway. To me it was kind of a way for them to say \"see how difficult your weight makes things?\"\n\nTo top it all off, before I left the nurse told me I shouldn't get my nails done anymore because it's not good for me. Silly me, I thought I was going there to get a cyst looked at. Nope, turns out I went to get unsolicited life and health advice that had nothing to do with the issue at hand.\n\nTLDR; Went to a hand surgeon, scheduled surgery to remove a cyst from my hand, majority of the time was spent by the doctor telling me I'm overweight, making false assumptions about my diet and giving me diet tips, and then the nurse told me getting my nails done is bad for me.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}
