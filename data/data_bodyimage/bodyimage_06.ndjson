How to make sense of it all and live a meaningful life despite not feeling good in my skin?", "author": "babypeach_", "self_text": "Warning: This post is pretty damn negative and I don't want to make someone in a similar situation feel shittier. The reason I'm writing is because I realize my experience is not helpful or healthy or  based on accurate assumptions, but despite this, I still struggle. And I'm hoping someone has a recommendation. I see a therapist who is extremely helpful and I take anti-anxiety medication. I don't exercise regularly and I don't meditate even though I want to be a person who does both things. My life is generally a mess right now (recently out of a long-term relationship, failed out of college, dysfunctional family, poor) so this fixation on my body is definitely being exacerbated by it.\n\nHi. 23 F, shouting into the void because I feel trapped in a body whose mercy I feel tirelessly at. Sorry for the stream of consciousness. I'm suffocating.\n\nI'm really struggling right now and hoping to find someone else who relates because I feel so alone. A lot of posts on here are about people concerned with their size, which is something I currently \u2014 for the first time in my life \u2014 actually feel less worried about because I've lost some weight, but I relate to it. I'm tall and I guess somewhat slender now. 5.9 and 137 pounds. My highest weight was 170, my \"normal\" weight was around in 150. I've basically fluctuated with the wind my entire life, and it just so happens I'm thin now because I'm a poor struggling student and have no money to buy food. So it's not like I really earned anything.\n\nSometimes I wish I could go back to just wishing I was skinnier, because change was always possible, rather than having permanent changes that only MAYBE surgery could fix. (Or maybe it's just because I have other, more troublesome things that I've been obsessing over: my skin. My stretch marks, which are plentiful. My tits, which hang low now and are loose.)\n\nI can't look in the mirror anymore. I've always, always had poor body image. When I was 5, I asked my mom if I was fat because my little tummy bulged like 5-year-old bellies do. I discovered my \"hip dips\" at 11, and stared at them in the mirror wishing they'd go away. If I looked a little longer, I thought they might. At 13, I developed an eating disorder that would last through high school. My face was routinely shoved with food, then in front of a toilet. I watched pounds trickle off when I had weeks of self-control, then I'd watch them flood back in the moment I couldn't stop thinking about binging. I dreamed about the life I would live when I finally got skinny. The person I would become. In these fantasies, I was someone different. Not just thinner, but a different body frame. Different face. Different self. So I realize that my poor body image is deeply rooted in a floundering relationship with my self and my self-worth. My parents were largely absent in my teenage years. My mom died when I was 6, so I didn't have her as a role model. My borderline step-mom led me to believe that my experiences were ultimately silly, and that I was an idiot, an ugly and fat. I had no self-esteem. My dad told me, when I was 17, that I had the body of a 30-year-old. So they definitely didn't help.\n\nI feel stuck in skin I can barely stand to look at. I can hardly look in the mirror. I'm having a very hard time accepting that this is my body now, when my former body feels so close but so far. I used to inspect myself before showering when I was younger, yeah maybe wishing certain areas were smaller but feeling overall okay with how things looked. I still felt worthy of a lover, I wanted to be seen naked, I could look at my bare body and feel good.\n\nNow, I guess from weight change, my thighs are literally covered in white, deep and thick stretchmarks. It used to be my favorite part of my body, like my upper thighs. And now there's stretchmarks basically a quarter of the way down my thighs, and halfway around. They're like several inches long, and overlapping, and the texture is just totally different. I can hardly stomach looking at them some days. It doesn't feel like my body. My ass is smaller and again covered in stretchmarks. Like there's grooves, it's not just lines. And they go up my hips and towards my back, another area I used to love.\n\nMy boobs are a whole other beast. I've always been self-conscious of how they're not perky, they're looser, my nipples are wider. But after weight loss, they got smaller and just deflated. The skin is stretched, crepey and wrinkles in my bra. And they're saggy as shit. I just feel horrible looking in the mirror, despite looking decent when I'm in clothes. I used to love being naked. I want to love being naked again! I've always held out hope that plastic surgery could help them, and I even saw a top-rated plastic surgeon in my city last week for a consultation. (I'm very willing to go through surgery if it means a better experience in my skin). He told me there wasn't much he could do based on the anatomy of my tits. They're not quite deflated enough that he felt it was worth the money and scars, and implants wouldn't help.\n\nI sat in my car and just cried. Not even a plastic surgeon could help me, and stretch marks can't be fixed either. At least weight is changeable, I just feel absolutely stuck now. I can't picture myself being vulnerable with someone else. I don't want to be in my underwear around my friends, whereas I used to be teased for being super open with my body. I couldn't take off my bra during sex with my ex-boyfriend, and now that I'm recently single again, I'm struggling to imagine someone choosing my body over some other hotter 23-year-old's. Why am I going through this when I'm so young? I want to enjoy my body. It feels like I've had kids and this is my post-baby body when I haven't. Why are none of my friends going through this? Why do I have to feel this way, when I have a slew of other issues I need to deal with? I literally called out of work today because I felt so run down by this negative experience with myself.\n\nI'm constantly comparing myself to other people. When I see someone, I immediately imagine them naked (not in a sexual way), and picture their smooth skin and normal tits. I'm not an idiot, I know most people don't have tight perky boobs and perfect bodies, but I still feel like their flawed bodies are better than mine.\n\nI feel inherently apart from and less than other people, because of my body and other things. I'm scared of missing out. I'm an incredibly aesthetic person and feel inspired by beauty. How can I live an enjoyable life if I no longer enjoy this vessel carrying me? It feels like because of these changes, I can't do certain things. I can't have afternoon sex with the daylight sun on me because it makes my stretchmarks more noticeable. I can't have a hot stranger take off my dress and have steamy, random sex. I can't go swim in the river the way I used to. I can't go braless, ever. I feel like self-care isn't worth it, grooming myself isn't worth it, planning for my future isn't worth it because my body is just going to continue to get uglier.\n\nI know all these things are not objectively true, and they might seem vain or whatever, but it's the most painful part of all: not feeling free in my body any more.\n\nWhat is the point of this all if I can't enjoy my own body? It's making me feel like my life isn't worth living.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

My 5\"4\" mother is the size of a child and this 5\"6.5\" former beauty queen had  inherited her bone structure.\n\nAll throughout high school and even college I've weighed about 115 lbs and to me, that was normal! No diets, no eating disorders. Just me going about trying to live my best life.\n\nFlash forward to 26 and here I am weighing 140 lbs. By no means am I fat. In fact, I still look incredibly skinny! Still tall, still lanky, just filled out in all the right places. However, I'm struggling with the idea that I am now a size medium.\n\nIt's silly, I know. But it hit me today as I just received my new summer bikini in the mail. I ordered a medium because in the past I've ordered a small to no avail and when I tried it on IT FIT PERFECTLY.\n\nI've had to donate so much of my wardrobe to my skinnier friends and it has killed me. So many size 2 dresses, gone. The cutest going out outfit, buh bye. Small size bikinis, out the door.\n\nI know this may sound shallow of me but I need to remind you that I was a former beauty queen and had done some modeling. It's engrained in my brain that small is beautiful, even though I still look and feel \"beautiful\".\n\nI see girl's younger than me, these \"Instagram models\" who I used to look like flaunting themselves, and their bodies, in skimpy outfits (or none at all) all over social media. I used to have a career in social where I had to see this all the time and it really diminishes my self image.\n\nYes, I am no longer a 19 year old beauty queen but I am beautiful, \"curvy\", and fully enjoying my DDs. But there is something deep down inside of me that cringes when I have to admit I am a size medium.\n\nI know that vanity sizing is a thing and maybe that somewhat comes into play but the truth of the matter is is that I just need to accept it and be confident. Accept that I am no longer and will never choose to be a size 2 and that I should love myself just the way I am. But it is so difficult in today's social media driven culture to be self accepting.\n\nThank you for reading my rant, I hope that others can take something away from this. I am still learning and growing as a person and hope to come to accept myself and my new norm.\n\nAlthough there are others who deal with much more extreme forms of body dysmorphia please understand my background and why I feel the way I do.

It\u2019s been especially difficult to manage these feelings for a year or so and have been previously diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Alongside this, I have psoriasis and arthritis which I am currently on medication to control my symptoms.\n\nI used to be significantly overweight throughout adolescence and have lost 4 stone during the summer last year within a short amount of time. In fact, towards the end of last year near Christmas, I am sure that I was developing an eating disorder as I dropped well under 7stone.

I am 5ft tall and currently weigh 7 stone.\n\nAlthough I\u2019ve put on some healthy weight since and know I should probably put on some more, I still can\u2019t help but punish myself and compare myself to others.

I weight normal and have a cute face. Also, I like to think of myself as a quite rational person who understands how women are being made into feeling self-consious about the way they look and that is why it bothers me so much. I used to live in a very small town where everybody knows eachother, they look at you and comment everything. My ex boyfriend was a manipulative abuser who convinced me I look like shit over the years. Also, my mother puts a lot into the way she looks, dieting all the time and never feeling happy about herself. She comments the way I look every time she gets a chance, but never says anything nice. She never misses an opportunity to remind me I have a pimple or something I'm wearing isn't really flattering for my figure. She does this in a really nasty way and its hurtful but she doesn't seem to understand why although we talked about it. However, 5 years ago I moved to go to unviersity and surrounded myself with really supportive friends and found a new boyfriend who treats me like a queen. When I'm away from home I find myself thinking I look amazing and wearing everything I like, short and tight clothes or whatever. And every time I get back home for holidays I feel awful again and change my clothes 5 times in the morning because I don't like how it looks on me even though I've been loving that outfit before I came home. This is becoming quite exhausting and I hate that I can stop feeling this way although I know it is stupid.

I had to have a small medicinal implant to stop me from getting my period three years ago, as when you get your period, you generally stop growing. It was taken out last year. My doctors think I am a few months from getting my period.\n\nOk so I am incredibly insecure about most aspects of my body. I hate how wide my face is. I hate how big my nose is in proportion to my face. I hate the baby fat still left on my cheeks and how when I smile it makes me look Asian. The problem with that is, I\u2019m white. Like I\u2019m half German, the other half a mix of Eastern European. Definitely not Asian. And people think before they meet me I\u2019m Asian, and I\u2019ll constantly get questions. I\u2019m fairly tan too, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my skin color. I really don\u2019t mean this in any offensive way at all, it\u2019s just that people think I\u2019m a race that I am definitely not! \n\nIn addition to this, in relation to my GHD, I\u2019m 4\u201911.6, and they\u2019re not sure if they\u2019ll be able to get me to 5 feet because I\u2019m starting to plateau. And I just want to be 5 feet so freaking bad! I don\u2019t want to be just under 60 inches for all of my life! My mom says just to tell everyone I\u2019m 5 feet, but I\u2019ll still know that I\u2019m not! And I just feel so embarrassed because when I babysit or volunteer with kids, they always compare how they\u2019re almost as tall as me. Or when I\u2019m with adults, they always think I\u2019m much younger than I am. And I can\u2019t even fit right into most junior sized clothing! When I went to homecoming I had to get a kids sized dress. And I\u2019m in high school! It was so completely and utterly embarrassing and we had to look all over for a dress that wasn\u2019t covered in pink or had sequins and rainbows. It\u2019s a little easier to find everyday clothes because T-shirt\u2019s don\u2019t have to fit 100% like dresses do, and black leggings and Nike shorts come in every size. But for dresses, it\u2019s absolutely horrible. And I love dances because when I go to them I feel beautiful. I feel like people are looking at me and I feel great! But the work to find something I like is absolutely the worst!\n\nI also haven\u2019t gotten my period yet, which means I haven\u2019t really gotten a body shape yet. I mean, I guess I\u2019m an a-cup, sometimes a b-cup in bras, which is one of the few things I\u2019m happy about, but my hips are nonexistent. And technically if I measured my proportions, I\u2019m an hourglass but I\u2019m just so tiny there\u2019s barely a difference anybody,  much less guys, can even notice. And everyone\u2019s out there, having a boyfriend and hips and boobs and I\u2019m over here, with one ex, and probably nobody even noticing me, much less taking interest. And I know having a boyfriend isn\u2019t everything blah blah blah, but it\u2019s so hard when everyone else is going through relationships like tissues, and I\u2019m the odd one out.\n\nFor the past 2-3 years I\u2019ve been a solid 86-90 pounds, and it\u2019s always been that way. When I went to the doctor, they said I had gained 3 pounds in 6 months. They were excited about that. They had been trying to get me to gain weight, not that I was underweight, I was just heading that way, and again, I stayed the same weight for 2-3 years. But I just felt awful. I have a love for everything sugary, especially since my mom\u2019s a dietitian, so I\u2019ll sometimes have some ice cream without telling anyone to celebrate a bit. And I\u2019ve done this for years, but now after gaining the few pounds, I still feel the cravings but I feel so so so awful after the fact. I sometimes, especially since I\u2019m off of school for the summer and I can sleep in, justify it by skipping lunch, but I still feel so so embarrassed. My stomach is pretty flat but if you pinch it, there\u2019s baby fat, and it just makes me feel so embarrassed because the baby fat hasn\u2019t gone away yet because I haven\u2019t matured enough physically yet. I\u2019m so afraid I\u2019m going to become anorexic or bulimic or start skipping meals more often, and most of the time when I do it I\u2019m not hungry, but I still feel bad because I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s going to suddenly make me develop an eating disorder. Which I know is not how it works. \n\nI have anxiety, which I\u2019m probably sure you can tell in this post, and I\u2019m seeing a therapist and I\u2019m getting so much better on the anxiety front and I don\u2019t want to have to go back to weeklies, and I want to be able to deal with this on my own. I know everyone has body image issues, and hates a bunch of stuff about themselves, but I just want to feel beautiful, like I do at dances, more than just twice a year.\n\nEdit: I always feel awful when I express how I feel about my body because people always say \u2018omg you\u2019re so skinny/tiny how could you feel that way?\u2019 And like to me I don\u2019t look skinny. I don\u2019t look large, I just feel broad. And logically I know I look like all the other small girls do but I still feel like my shoulders are too broad, and my ribs are too big, despite the size of my ribs/waistline is what makes finding bras really hard because they\u2019re small. It still doesn\u2019t make me feel any better. I know all these things logically it just never connects emotionally.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

When I look in the mirror I like my appearance most of the time, depending on lighting etc. however, other people's reaction to me has me confused. I've done decently with romantic and sexual relationships and those partners, as well as many of my friends (moreso when I was younger), have told me I'm beautiful. But when I'm out and about with someone, I'm always \"the friend\" that doesn't get flirted with. Men will approach my friend, tell them they're beautiful, then either completely ignore me or say hi out of politeness. Even if the friend is someone who I consider average looking. Plus I barely ever get catcalled. Now I'm not looking for attention from strangers and I understand people have different preferences, but it's happened so consistently and never the other way around, that frankly it hurts and makes me doubt myself. I feel like strangers on the street are the most impartial judge, no? Plus, even one of my best friends has said \"you're not ugly\" but implied she didn't think I'm pretty. Photos and videos of me that I see, seem to back this up. So really I'm just confused. On one hand, I have the mirror, myself, some men, and some friends, telling me I'm attractive.

{"post_id": "c5uhbb", "created_utc": 1561577389, "title": "Just some strategies that help me be body positive", "author": "Shuiner", "self_text": "(on mobile sorry if formatting is trash)\n\nMost of the posts on this sub seem to be by those struggling with body image. I wanted to share the thoughts and mental exercises that help me the most. These don't apply to everyone or every problem, but I hope this is helpful to some.\n\n\n1. **Therapy** If you struggle daily, it's something to consider. I did cognitive behavioral therapy for years through a local University (affordable that way) and it changed my life. Many of the points below were things I learned in therapy.\n\n\n2. **Stop focusing on myself so much** Best thing my therapist ever convinced me to do was Volunteer. I spent so much time thinking about my body, and what others thought of me. Volunteering helped me recognize that my attractiveness means little to the world. People in need don't care what I look like. I can do good in the world; my looks can't. Spending so much time thinking about myself was a pitfall that stopped me from being the good person I wanted to be. \n\n\n3. **Think of my body like a friend** Imagine you have a friend that is there for you no matter what. Day in and day out without question. They have flaws, but they never give up. That's your body. It works nonstop to keep you alive and as healthy as it can. Instead of resenting it, have some compassion for it. It didn't ask to have an owner that hates it. It deserves to be respected and loved. Separating myself from my body really helps me feel more loving towards my body.\n\n\n4. **Stop comparing my body to others** Easier said than done, I know. Similar to having compassion for my body, I had to learn compassion for those around me. I no longer reduce a beautiful person to their body. They don't deserve to have me dehumanize them. They are humans with insecurities and struggles. Their bodies don't make them better or worse people. Their beauty isn't some magical key to happiness. My envy is completely misplaced.\n\n\n5. **Seek out positive examples of bodies like mine** One of my main issues was that I'm fat (sorry for those who don't like that word but it's the one I prefer), and there's a lot of public negativity towards that. But when I actively seek out positivity from fat people, it helps me feel more confident. I follow plus size blogs, YouTube channels, etc. I see a person my size wearing cute clothes and think they look nice, then it's easier to think I look nice. I honestly like clothes shopping now, which would seem crazy to old me.\n\n\n6. **Accept your feelings** This, for me, is especially helpful when someone does say or do something hurtful regarding my body. I get body shamed a good amount, and no matter how much I generally love my body, it hurts. And that's okay. I don't have to be a super woman who doesn't let anything bother me. I accept when my feelings are hurt, give myself time to cry or get angry, then try to gently pull myself away from those negative thoughts by doing all the above steps. \n\n\n7. **I only have this reality** Some things you can't change. You can't make your hip bones narrower or shoulders broader. Some things won't change. I work to improve and be healthy, but it's likely I'll always be considered fat.\n\nDo I want to look back at these years and say \"I'm so glad I spent thousands of hours obsessing about not liking my body.\"? Or do I want to know I lived the best life I could with the hand I was dealt? \n\nI decided to be the person I dreamed of being in the body I have, instead of waiting for the body I thought I needed. I'm far from perfect, but I'm so much happier this way!", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

Like the title says, I'm really upset about something weird. It's considered kind of socially unacceptable even to be upset about this. Looking for advice. If this is the wrong sub for this, please direct me to a better sub. I wasn't sure where to go with this.\n\nLike most males born in America, I was circumcised as a newborn. I despise it. I despise it. I despise it. There are no words adequate enough for me to describe how much I deeply hate it. Circumcision has destroyed me. I kept hearing the words \"circumcision\" and \"foreskin\" every now and then through adolescence and always thought \"thank god my parents aren't religious.\" So I always figured I wasn't circumcised. In reality, I had a mild botch. The doctor took off too much skin, which makes erections feel painful and tight. I realized that I was circumcised on my 18th birthday when I saw my first intact cock in porn. At first I thought the guy just had a cool genetic mutation or something. I was curious about what was going on here, and I remember when I realized I was circumcised jumping up from my seat in horror like there was a rat or snake on my desk. Suddenly, the pain and some of the other problems I've had with my penis started making sense to me. I'm at peace with the rest of my body, but I absolutely hate that I was circ'd. I've never directly confronted my parents over this, but I've brought up the subject a few times in casual conversation. Apparently, the reason they had me circumcised was so I could match my father. Fuck. They each think foreskins are \"weird.\" If it were done because the doctor pushed for them to do it or because I had a medical emergency that couldn't be treated with more conservative methods, I think I could handle that better. But because they wanted me to match my dad, that makes it so much worse. Why couldn't they have just respected my bodily integrity? I'm in a pretty progressive part of the country where circumcision was quite a bit rarer the year I was born compared to other states. What the fuck? It's not okay. I'm constantly depressed. I wake up every morning, and there's a split second where I forget that I'm circumcised. It's the happiest part of my day. That split second seems to get shorter and shorter as the mornings pass. I genuinely believe circumcision is the worst thing to ever happen to me. It's worse than when my ex gf cheated on me with my best friend, it's worse than when my sisters disowned me for seemingly no reason, it's worse than the bullying I received as a small child, and it's worse than my parents getting divorced. This is, by a landslide, the most difficult thing I've ever been through. I honestly do NOT understand how so many guys can be seemingly content with being circumcised. I feel completely at odds with the world.\n\nI basically can't look at my parents anymore without filling to the brim with rage and disgust. I fantasize every day about killing myself so I can hurt them back. But I think I won't. I'd rather just feel better about this and live my life as originally intended. There are a couple things I've tried to feel better about this. The first is foreskin \"restoration\" where guys basically stretch out their remaining shaft skin to create a \"fauxskin.\" It looks and acts like a foreskin but without the nerves or supporting structures. This is a very long and physically painful process. I've done some of this, and it has made erections less tight. The other thing I've done is give to Foregen, which always makes me feel better. They're a group that wants to use regenerative medicine to grow back foreskins. IIRC, they're on animal trials. I've tried my hand at activism, but I don't think any of the existing anti-circumcision activism is radical enough. But that's a rant for a different time.\n\nMy question is simple. Since I have a long time to wait before I can restore the whole \"fauxskin\" or get the real deal with Foregen's regenerative medicine, what are some things I can while I wait to feel more at peace? I'd also like to take my mind off of it, but that's really difficult for me. Sorry again if this is the wrong sub for this.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I have been really happy recently with my size and the feeling of being curvaceous and \"thick\". My husband claims to love my size and doesn't want me any smaller and not a whole lot bigger. Although, I have been bigger and he has never protested. I like my looks as far as my face goes and id say that I am of average to mildly exceptional good looks. I'm by no means striking or gorgeous. My issue comes to light when I am around other women. I start to compare myself to them and becoming embarrassed of my body if i feel as though they are smaller or thinner than me. Almost to the point that I assume they're secretly judging me. My husband's sister will be in town soon. She's gorgeous and fit. Her children are not much younger than me and they're all gorgeous and fit. When they visit the whole family comes together to catch up and that is when I am around both my husband's sister and his brother's wife, whom is very very thin. So when we're all together I will be the biggest one of us all and I cant help but dread how I'll feel. I want to love my body always and feel good the way I am. I am healthy. I am very happy with my life ( which is when I'm the biggest. If I'm depressed I'll lose weight like it's nothing).
