To say my husband has been traumatized by this is an understatement. He was already struggling with severe depression and occasionally suicidal thoughts. Losing his mom just absolutely squashed any part of him that could still look forward with hope. I've strived to be everything he could need (his mother was his only family, he has few friends that are very close). He had to quit working so I'm supporting us on a not great teacher's salary. On paper, everything is fine. Our lawyers have a very air tight case to file against the hospital, my job can keep bills paid and all that. But emotionally I am drowning. I feel like I haven't had my husband here for a year. I'm lonely. \n\nAll this to say, I've been emotionally eating like a mother fucker. I've gained a not insignificant amount of weight in the last year, enough that I can feel its effect (being almost 35 and depressed also doesnt help.) My back hurts and I'm exhausted after work. My clothes are on the edge of not fitting well anymore. I'm finding it hard to muster up energy to do things I enjoy, much less go workout after work (my days at school often start at 6:30 so it's not feasible for me to exercise before school. I cant wake up at 4am. I'm not that person). \n\nI want to feel better but I dont want to get in the mindset of being hateful towards myself and my body. I'm thinking about joining the Y and doing some low impact pool classes. Over the summer I was working out a bit by dancing, but would get frustrated when i couldn't physically keep up, and would need to take many breaks. Logically i know being mad and hateful to myself about this will only hurt me. But my emotional response remains the same, hateful self talk that my mother instilled me as a child.  \n\nI'm just feeling lost, overwhelmed, tired. I needed to vent.

I was already really upset with this friend because she didn't really get the idea of boundaries. I also felt that she was prettier than me, smarter than me, had a better personality, etc. Overall I just had low self-esteem. But most importantly at the time, she was much thinner than me. I'm relatively healthy but I've been brought up being told that I'm too big (especially by \"Asian standards\" due to my ethnic background). My confidence has been going up steadily over the past few years, but it's crashed in the past few days because my boyfriend and this girl recently started talking again. I know that there is nothing going on between them and our relationship is wonderful, but I can't stop seeing myself as this chubby, flatchested and weirdly built person all over again.

I'm relatively healthy and my weight is fine. I try my best to go to the gym and I'm proud when make time for it, but it's been so difficult lately.

Today, a girl and i were talking dirty and swapping pics and she asked for a dick pic, so i sent her one, and she replied with \"Your dick is small, but cute.\" I felt so shattered and embarassed that i stopped talking to her and i cut all ties with her. I dont like my penis anymore, and i find everything about it ugly. All i can think about is how lucky those big guys who post on penis subreddits and ratemybody are. Im sad, and im crying right now.

I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just trying to give context. \n\nWhen I\u2019m at work (retail), customers will say stuff like\n \u201coh you must eat like a bird!\u201d\n\u201cOh my gosh you\u2019re so thin! ...well you must not eat very much\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re thin as a rail! You need to eat more\u201d\nI\u2019m just trying to make small talk at the registers sometimes and these people turn it into a questionnaire about my eating habits. I always say \u201cyeah I eat a lot actually but my metabolism is super fast. It\u2019s a blessing and a curse\u201d but most people don\u2019t like that answer. They just kinda say \u201creally? Oh.\u201d And it\u2019s annoying bc I know in their heads their thinking yeah right lady. \nThis is a legit conversation I had with a coworker\nMe: *walks by*\nHer: oh my gosh you\u2019re so thin!!!\nMe: ....yeah I\u2019ve always been this way. It\u2019s a blessing and a curse. \nHer: well do you eat!???\nMe: ....yeah?? \nAnd I just walked away. Another time one of my coworkers was suggesting a burger place for lunch and she interrupted herself and said \u201cwait do you eat?\u201d And I was just kinda set back. I don\u2019t understand why literally everyone thinks just bc I\u2019m thin that it\u2019s okay to comment on my weight. Maybe I don\u2019t wanna be thin! \n\nOnce, I walked by two customers talking to each other and I heard one of em say, \u201coh my god look she\u2019s so skinny\u201d in this kinda rude judgy tone. Another time an old coworker came in to shop and she straight up asked me, \u201care you getting thinner?\u201d And her face kinda contorted all weird and showed disgust. \nAny time I\u2019m helping a customer in the plus size section and they talk about some problem they maybe are having with the way a piece of clothing is fitting, they always throw in, \u201coh well you wouldn\u2019t know, you\u2019re tiny\u201d and it\u2019s like yeah lady I\u2019m tiny. I, too, have many problems finding that perfect dress that fits just right. But I can\u2019t say that. \n\nSo basically if you\u2019re thin in the Midwest, society is gonna harass you about it and tear down your self esteem with these weird comments that make you feel like you look ugly and too thin. \nSometimes I come home and ask my bf if I\u2019m too skinny or if I look like I\u2019m dying or something bc people treat me like this. I\u2019m just sick of it. I think that if it\u2019s not okay to fat shame people, it shouldn\u2019t be okay to skinny shame people either.

I have a condition (which has caused about a million anomalies in my body - ok that's an exaggeration - the issues aren't life threatening but serious enough to require management to avoid complications - some of which can be severe).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I was born with large feet and getting shoes/trainers is a nightmare. I've found lots of choice now, mostly in the USA (so I can't even try shoes before I buy, making it a big gamble). It does not help that most shoes are ugly and when you look at shows by feature, I need everything. e.g. wide toe box, extra depth, stretchable, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, so the shoes I have dealt with and being able to get them from USA helps.\n\nA few years ago I developed a symptom of my primary condition which means my legs got a bit bigger. Jeans used to be easy to wear and find, but now I have limited choice, and like with shoes, need to get from USA. I also don't want jeans that are too baggy. I won't feel attractive in that (or ugly shoes). Today I threw a tantrum as I am fed up with my current jeans that are loose but just catch on the biggest point of my calf. I am lucky that my leg swelling is not noticeable in public and I have no pain or tiredness. On top of all this, I decided to try on an old pair of jeans I outgrew, no idea why, when I already did this when the swelling happened and the conclusion was they are too tight to wear. Not sure what I was looking to achieve there, probably just want to go back to old times...\n\nI discussed this with friends and one friend kind of helped, but from both, they put it down to first world problems.

However, I couldn't help but immediately notice those parts of my body that I feel insecure about-my hips, my tummy, my legs, my arms (basically my entire body). Like this sub's description, we are constantly bombarded with the \"ideal body\" within today's society. So, I was instantly examining myself under that microscope. I felt so insecure, like I had no \"figure\" in comparison to the women that are plastered in front of us.  \n\nBut then, I took a step back and picked up a different lens.  I decided to look at my body under the beauty standards of Ancient Greece and Rome. I looked up statues of Venus and Aphrodite, the respective goddesses of beauty, and admired that they have tummies and hips and bumps and rolls just like me! AND they were regarded as the epitomes of beauty. This is something I do every now and again to remind myself that a lot of today's beauty standards aren't of human bodies, but of medically altered bodies. Bodies that are stretched, and pinched, and pushed to an extreme the doesn't resemble its natural course. \n\nThe Greeks and Romans just loved the human body for what it was- tissue, fat, and flesh. And that is how I choose to love my body. I hope that sharing my method of body acceptance and appreciation can lend itself to others- men and women alike- to appreciate their bodies for what they are- bodies!", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I QUIT A PASSION I LOVED BECAUSE I DIDNT LIKE HAVING MUSCLE-Y FUCKING LEGS, FOR GODS FUCKING SAKE WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME. \n\nand in addition to this, around the same time my mum and her ex boyfriend (who, may i add, i think has given me some mindset problems; like i\u2019ve never gotten on with my mum because of him, he teared down my confidence, make me scared to share my emotions and feelings, and made me feel isolated from everyone else. when i told my mum this - respectfully, cause it was a touchy subject - she would scream at me which kinda made me more shy of sharing my thoughts and feelings, which is probably why i\u2019m discussing my body image issues on reddit when i have literally told no one about this). wow i went off on a tangent, but anyways, my mum and her ex had a messy break up back in september and it kinda dragged out and to make a long story short, at this time i would get in from school; feel depressed because pf hormones i guess; be hungry as shit; my mum would say she could her voices shouting over the road from our house (where he ex lived oops)(also: this made everyone think she was crazy because who cant hear even the loudest of shouting when there is a busy main road in between the houses); she would shout at me for not being able to hear the voices; i would sit in my room alone and feel guilty and unable to share my thoughts; then my sister would get home from her boyfriends at 10pm and shout at me for not helping our mum even though MY SISTER DIDN\u2019T KNOW HALF OF THE SITUATION BECAUSE SHE WAS NEVER HOME, AND SHE WOULDN\u2019T LISTEN TO ME WHEN I TRIED TO COMMUNICATE HOW TERRIFYING IT IS TO A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD WHEN AN AUTHORITATIVE FIGURE IS SHOUTING AT YOU FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR VOICES. \n\nto summarise, i was in a bad situation and i think i might of been depressed lol. \n\nbut the point of that tangent, i moved in with my dad because my mum wasn\u2019t stable at the time.\n\nnow this may all seem irrelevant but this is probably the most important part, because at my dads he was lowkey concerned about my eating but like wouldn\u2019t  straight up say it. like he accepted i wouldn\u2019t eat breakfast because i said it made me feel sick. but his girlfriend (who was probably more concerned that him because i assume she gets what its like to be a teenage girl and wanting to lose weight to feel like we fit in), she would buy me food to eat after school (healthy food, but still food) and i always ate it because i have no self control and felt bad and didn\u2019t want to disappoint them i guess.\n\nbecause my metabolism (i\u2019m not a doctor i\u2019m just making educated guesses at this point) wasn\u2019t used to much food at all i put on some weight on my legs which pretty much brought me back to square one. the muscle that was no longer in use had now turned into fat and i was putting on weight. so now my legs weren\u2019t even just big they were also JIGGLY FOR CHRISTS SAKE.\n\nmind you i still wasn\u2019t even particularly fat, like i had a flat stomach, tiny waist, but big legs. i wasn\u2019t fat, and i knew it, but i FELT fat.\n\nmy living arrangement and weight gain stayed the same until about may, by then i was visiting my mum on fridays to saturdays and she was becoming more stable. and my dad was getting an extension (which if you have ever had one you will know they\u2019re a nightmare). so i had to go and stay with my mum for a while. by now my body was used to much more food that previously, i was eating two solid meals per day, but would also like binge eat a lot during the day. i tried to purge, but found out i have very little of a gag reflex when i\u2019m in control, like i would literally sit bu the toilet with my fingers pretty damn far down my throats pressing hard on the back of my tongue and nothing was happening, i was pretty fucking devastated say the least.\n\nbut nonetheless i moved back into my mums house, planning to cut down on the food big time. but i couldn\u2019t, and it was literally so heart breaking and frustrating to me. \n\nif you couldn\u2019t tell food and weight was all i could think about now, and i knew it was bad.\n\ni would constantly tell myself, \u2018okay next week only one meal like old times,\u2019 and when i couldn\u2019t control myself it would be, \u2018okay no food at all next week,\u2019 and i couldn\u2019t do that remotely. i felt so useless, which made me feel so depressed and isolated. i think this is when i began to realise this was becoming a problem. i would begin to eat a food item and halfway through i wouldn\u2019t  be able to eat it anymore because it made me feel disgusting.\n\nanother incident i would like to bring up is one time in the car when my mum offered me a biscuit, i declined, and she said with the most disgust in her voice, \u2018why are you starving yourself,\u2019 i cried about that like a week later, it hurt that she wasn\u2019t at all understanding, like mental health isn\u2019t something we talk about unless its hers. she proper fishes for sympathy all the time but when i try and help or offer support she shouts at me saying that i wouldn\u2019t understand cause i\u2019m a kid. that kinda sucked.\n\n\nanother quick incident, last month, for the first time in literally my whole life i wanted to talk about my mental health to my mum, i seriously thought (and still kinda think) i\u2019m depressed, and i want to feel better. so i told her about what i was feeling and my thoughts on the subject, and bitch, let me tell you, the most invalidating thing i have ever experienced was (and still is) being told, \u2018you\u2019re not depressed, its just hormones,\u2019 and yes. this may be true, but you don\u2019t say that, i put myself in a vulnerable position (which was a big arse step) only to get dismissed.\n\nthe unhealthy body image continued till year 10 (age 15, now) in this past month things have gotten worryingly worse, last week i literally went on the biggest food binge ever, i mean PROPER BINGE, everyday for a week i ate until it hurt, physically hurt my stomach. and i think this because i grew 1 inch taller in a week (mad ik) but it made me feel so shitty. not only do i now have big jiggly legs, my stomach isn\u2019t flat anymore, like it isn\u2019t huge but it makes a big difference because i have pretty small hips so i kinda just lost my waistline and i look like a cereal box. it makes me feel so disgusting. most of all i\u2019ve just had a week break for half term, so i\u2019m scares that when i go back people are going to notice that i\u2019ve put on weight.\n\ni think i want to cut down on food, like one meal a day, like i used to, and then slowly cut down more. idk i\u2019m going to see how it goes, because as of now i\u2019m more concerned about my stomach than my legs, but still, i want to lose weight.\n\nthanks for reading this long arse post, i just really need advice, or maybe just someone to say they understand, i just don\u2019t want to feel alone i guess.", "subreddit": "BodyImage"}

I have broad shoulders, slim hips and a near straight waist.\n\nI think I look ok enough when I look in the mirror, but whenever someone is complimenting me or a guy is looking at me I just think \"They probably think I have a better waist or proportions than I actually have\". I tend to wear what I like but I feel like clothes are still covering up a lot of my figure.

I\u2019m female ,19, and have always been insecure about the way I look. But it\u2019s gotten worse over the years due to abusive relationship, terrible friends , bulling ,my medical issues, mental health ,and autism. The thing I\u2019m most insecure about tho is my boobs. My left boob is a 32 E but my right boob barley fits into a 32 D cup. So as you can see there\u2019s a bit of a size difference, one hangs way lower than the other and not only that but they sag , and that\u2019s partially due to the curve in my spine (scoliosis). Basically my insecurities about my chest have gotten so bad that every time I see boobs on a film or in a tv show, or on social media, I cry, so I\u2019m reduce to watching kids films most of the time. When ever I get triggered I hide under my covers, or behind a cushion and I\u2019ll cry for hours. I can\u2019t look at my naked body in the mirror or I feel sick, I hate having to bath because having to touch my boobs makes me want to cry and throw up, I keep my shirt on when I\u2019m intimate with my partner (which isn\u2019t often due to all this) and I don\u2019t ever let him touch them, I hide under covers to get dressed and undressed. \n\nTo make matters worse , I have a clothing issue which means I find it extremely uncomfortable to wear certain clothes, including bras, which means I\u2019m never wearing one, which makes my boobs look saggier and just grosser.\n\nI honestly at this point don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019ve struggled with mental health , self harm, suicidal thoughts for years and I\u2019d been clean for almost a year really and now it\u2019s getting to the point where all those thoughts are coming back and I just can\u2019t take it, I spend 90% of my time crying and think about how much I hate my body, and I really try not to but it\u2019s just always in the back of my mind ya know. \n\nSo like could someone just tell me what to do cause I really don\u2019t know anymore?

She\u2019s making these comments about herself on posts she makes on her finsta account (fake instagram account;an account not connected to her identity for those who don\u2019t know). She struggles with other mental health issues that she is also candid about, but I think she\u2019s also struggling with body dysmorphia and may not know it, since she\u2019s not actually fat, and even if she was that wouldn\u2019t make her \u201cugly\u201d.\n\n I am bigger than her, and although still fairly straight-sized, I\u2019m kind of on the border between straight- and plus-size. I am also very comfortable in my body for the most part, but seeing these posts she makes about herself can sometimes get to me, and it also just makes my heart hurt for her that she is struggling with accepting her body and saying such negative things about herself. \n\nI don\u2019t want to unfollow her, as she is a close friend and I follow her finsta to stay up to date on how she is doing in general, not just mental health stuff. I would really just like some advice or suggestions for things I could comment on these posts she makes or message her that would counter her negative body speak, support her and lift her up as a friend, while also not perpetuating the idea she has internalized that fat=ugly, bad, etc. As of right now, my tactic is to just kind of ignore the posts, which I realize is not great, but I am at a loss for what else to do.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not trying to single-handedly solve her body image issues. I know that is not my job and that she needs to talk to her therapist about this. I\u2019m simply looking for how to support her as a close female friend. \n\nTL;DR: Friend makes negative comments about her body on social media, need suggestions for how to counter it/support her without perpetuating \u201cfat=ugly,bad,etc\u201d.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}
