Anyways ...\n\nI just had one of the biggest fights with my wife and it has left feeling frustrated, raw and empty, but I need to do something meaningful with these feelings, so I am turning to you folks. \n\nThe fight stems from my wife approaching me for the 40th time with weird welts/hives on her arms, chest and back. She has had a number of weird symptoms for years now and it just seems to be  getting worse every week. My frustrations comes from the fact that she will not even attempt to find a general practitioner that will figure out what's wrong with her.\n\nSome background: I have been with my wife since we were in high school and we're in our early 30s now with a toddler, our dream home and decent careers. We were already three years in to this relationship when she was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism/Hashimoto's disease. \u00a0She had gained 80+ pounds over the course of our teenage years and her energy level dropped. Her pediatrician, under her parent's insurance did a decent job, but as soon as she was off her parent's insurance, we really couldn't afford to keep going back to him. So as a result, years went by where she saw no doctors about her disease. Luckily, out of courtesy her pediatrician keep refilling her prescriptions, but did little to monitor her numbers. Her weight has fluctuated greatly over her 20s and 30s, never once has it affected how I feel about her, but it has made her feel self conscious, disgusted and ultimately depressed. I have watched her practically starve herself to be thin and work her ass off to shed the weight only to have be put back on. \n\n\nWhen she became pregnant a few years back we qualified for state insurance assistance, and we did get her thyroid numbers under control, but I feel like it was too little, too late. \n\n\nMy wife barely eats and she is fairly active. I on the other hand eat like shit, and I'm pretty overweight. (5\u201911\u201d 250, big frame, muscular) but it's unfairly easy for me to lose weight. If I diet for a month and hit the gym three times a week I can drop 10 to 20lbs with little effort.  Also keep in mind that she has literally perfect blood pressure and near perfect cholesterol numbers. Her blood sugar is normal and she eats fairly healthy compared to me.\n\n\nAnyway, here's the thing; my wife's weight is a direct result of her Hashimoto's disease, and I feel that all these additional symptoms she is experiencing (memory/cognitive issues, weird allergic reactions, hives all over her body, hair loss, weight fluctuation, crazy migraines, sore joints, and constant exhaustion) are signs that things are getting way worse. \n\n\nThe fight came down to me losing it because of this cynicism she demonstrates. Think of my wife as like a curvy April Ludgate from Parks and Rec, it's hilarious at times but can suck when you're trying to deal with real stuff. \u00a0A few months back I got my dream job, which includes amazing health insurance for my wife, my son and I. I just assumed that my wife would be eager to find a doctor ASAP and I was wrong.\n\n\nMy wife claimed that most of the doctors she has seen in her life have pretty much have dismissed any of her symptoms and just tell her she just needs to lose weight and she'll feel better. She then went on and explained that many large women, regardless or health are met with the same issues. This obviously made it quite hard for her to want to find a doctor that understands the issues surrounding her disease, when she has had her weight, which again is a result of her disease, thrown in her face.\n\n\nI didn't believe her. \n\n\nAnd she got upset. And she was justified for being mad at me for this, because I honestly thought it was just her dumb teenage like cynicism. I thought she was just making excuses for not getting her health under control. I was wrong. \n\n\nThe fight ended as I was questioning the validity of her obstinance, and she just told me to \u201cdo some research about it, I'm going to bed.\u201d \n\n\nSo I did just that, I found this VICE article, along with a ton of other first hand examples and research that explains the bias and discrimination against large women in the medical industry, it's even worse for large women of color. It completely opened my eyes to what my wife had been experiencing. I feel like a bag of shit for not understanding her experience. At some point in the fight I even said \u201cI'm fat too, and I've never experienced this.\u201d Which she replied, \u201cyou're a man, it's different.\u201d and I ignore it, and I shouldn't have. \n\n\nSo with all that being said, how do I help my wife find a Doctor that isn't just going to see her as a fat person, but as a sick person in need?\n\n\nTLDR: My wife is chubby because of a disease and could be really sick, but she can't find a doctor who isn't a jerk about her weight. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I guess it's time I join the rest of humanity in getting emotional and sexual needs fulfilled online rather than bothering my mate when he's busy. \n\nHe had a post on this group, but it was rejected. I saw it a couple weeks ago, but don't know what his write up was. I wish I did. I have a notion that understanding might help me cope, or change. However, I'm not much of a confidant either. \n\nNone of this is new to me. I have always been open to swinging. Hoping it could help me make meaningful friendships with women. Also hoping it would foster total honesty and transparency in all relationships.\n\nIt does neither. However, I refuse monogamy. It's a pathway to feeling unfulfilled, yet staying together out of obligation. \n\nIt never brings out the best in anyone. I love him, and I love to see him feeling his Swagger. He only shines that bright when there are fun friends with us. \n\nI've given him an open door to pursue side pussy, but he won't go without me. \n\n I know having his woman with him is cock blocking him. So many women I figure would gladly cheat with him, but they think it's weird that we wish to do things together. Even the hooker backed out of the discussed arrangement. \n\nMen who have spent time with us have totally tried getting me to sneak around, and I won't. Their attention doesn't satisfy anything for me. He is more jealous than I am. The men like to lie to us both. They are more trouble than I need.\n\nHe openly refuses to even get a massage without me, even though his need for attention from other women is such that it pains me to see him feeling rejected and low. We have had a difficult year.  I wish that I could create the golden feeling inside him, but I'm just too goddamn stable and boring. I'm what he needs, but as usual, I'm not what he wants.\n\nI've never been able to keep men interested for long unless I refused to be their woman. This was especially true if I refused to fuck them at all. My only power is to be their fox to hunt. Once caught, I am worth less and less. \n\nI'm not 16 though. I'm a grown woman who thinks the tendency men have to lose interest and need attention elsewhere is unfair. The more we connect, the greater my desire for him. But when I see him becoming distant, giving his thoughts and feelings to others while becoming cross with me, I fall behind and pull away myself.\n\nHe wants me to be the initiator, and has all but ceased to get things started, so our once very active and interesting sex life has become occasional.   He is often distant and distracted. I know he hides conversations from me. I don't know for certain that he's having interactive masterbation, but I see plenty of evidence that it's happening. He once adamantly denied such things. Now he gets snappy when I ask about his day.\n\nIf I come home hoping he's in a sex mood, he sometimes acts like, for him, the mood has passed.  He doesn't always join me when I masterbate. \n\nI am beginning to feel like I should give up on sex again. Give up on myself. There are too many things I'm naive and insecure about, and I'm too old to bother with. \n\nHe had nearly healed those thoughts from me. But facts are facts. Every man I've given love and time to has done this, most being much worse.  For some reason I'm the girl they want to live with, but not the girl who truly excites and fulfills them.\n\nSo, rather than giving in to hopelessness and destroying my last chance at being loved, maybe it's time I followed suit. Maybe I can learn to be less depressed, and not feel so left out. \n\nI can have secret sex friends too, right. Maybe I can find a friend who helps me feel less inhibited. Maybe I can even find a woman friend who is more dominant. \n\nMaybe she will teach me to be more dominant with him, and maybe that will help him be more fulfilled. \n\nOr maybe I'll just keep it all a fucking secret. Delete messages. Get snippy when asked about photos. Seem too grumpy for sex, but come back a few hours later with a spring in my step that he didn't put there.\n\nTalk about sex I plan for that afternoon, but then appear indifferent to the notion. While being indifferent, I'll be sure to talk about great sex in my past, and look at porn, but make no overture towards my mate. \n\nWho am I fooling? I'll do what I always do. Patiently wait for him to need me, wishing I was his whore instead of his wife. \n\nIt's the whores who get their best. The good woman is what he keeps, but the whore is what's on his mind. \n\nSo is the idea that I have to be his good woman, but someone else's whore, in order to fit in? I know it's just cybering. I've always regarded any deception as cheating, and taking attention away from my mate seems wrong. \n\nHis post on this Reddit tells me that this is normal and he shouldn't have any issue with it at all.", "subreddit": "BodyImage"}

Some people from forums that promote weight loss are already healthy and have no problems other than being unhappy or anxiety issues with a certain number on the scale. Some weigh themselves multiple times a day, encourage people to snack on \u201clow cal\u201d food as a way to ineffectively starve off hunger.

How do I accept my body when I know how much my parents judge me for it? Am I wrong to so stubbornly refuse to prioritize weight loss? \n\nSo I'm 25F and currently living at home with my parents (my job is so close to home that it just made sense, and culturally its expected for women). They are always on me about my weight, especially now as they want me to get married soon. I'm overweight for sure (probably like 10lbs), but I eat alright and play sports competitively on a weekly basis. Practice 1-3 times a week.\n\nMy relationship with them is good *except* for when the topic of weight is brought up. They're always on me about losing 10lbs. When I do lose 10lbs, then it's \"keep going; you'd look so much better after another 10lbs\" etc. I struggled with an eating disorder in high school, but they always point to pictures of me at that time to say \"see you looked so good back then. You have the capability you just aren't motivated or disciplined like you used to be\". They do say I don't need to go as extreme as that (back then my mom would comment on how my chest would get too small if I kept dieting and exercising the way I was), but that I should try to bring some of that back.\n\nAfter my brother's wedding last year, my mom yelled at me the worst shes ever done on my birthday about how fat I looked in the pictures and how embarrassed she was when people commented on my back rolls (wore a sari which exposes the midriff). At the wedding I felt so beautiful as I had been working out regularly and was so excited at the occasion and outfits, but now I can't look at the pictures without feeling sick.\n\nAnyway, last night she and my dad were leaving to a party and right as they were she told me to make sure I exercised while they were out because they'd like me to lose 10lbs before their friends come in May. They're interested in my marrying the son of that family. I've never met him, but I like their family and would be open to the match. However, I told them that I'd rather they see and accept me as I am because I'd probably be at this weight after marriage even if I lose weight now. There was a quick back and forth about how I can't find a good match looking the way I do, etc. How they just want me to be my best so they can find the best guy for me. \n\nI guess I don't really know what I'm asking here. I just feel really sad and down. I want to love my body for what it is, but I hate that the people I love most in this world see me the way they do. I don't want to spend more of my free time exercising than I already do, and I really don't care to cut out any more foods. Losing 10-20lbs would probably help fix our family dynamic, but I just can't bring myself to prioritize that. I don't know what a good middle ground is. I don't know how to feel or if im justified in what I'm doing.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

It was a pretty difficult adjustment for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have struggled with an eating disorder for 5 years in the past. I would say I am 1-2 years recovered, it's hard to say when I \"fully recovered\" because I feel like recovery is a lifelong process but there was definitely a period where I felt my body heal significantly from my ED. I've always been naturally skinny but when I developed my ED to me I noticed I gained a bit of weight, about 10-15 pounds from water weight I'm assuming. I also was a competitive swimmer at the time and it was the first time I put on a lot of muscle. I looked \"healthier\" for the first time in my life my family said. Little did they know I was overexercising myself everyday and struggled to eat \"normally\". It's just been such a long journey with many low points that I have a hard time recalling because I've never healed my eating disorder with the help of a professional. My god did I have such shame talking about this with doctors, therapists, and nutritionists. I felt like nobody took me seriously because I \"looked\" fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI talked to my doctor on the phone today and he reminded me that I have gained 15 pounds since about a year ago. Yet, my clothes size has gotten quite tinier. I used to be a small-medium now I am an xxs to x-small. I've definitely struggled with body dysmorphia and not understanding my new body but the past 2 weeks it's felt good. I don't hate my thickness. I'm so accepting that my body is constantly changing. I might not like the way I look, but it doesn't emotionally leave me drained like it had before. I would like to change my body. I still wish to be skinnier, less muscular in some parts but I am okay with myself now. I don't calorie restrict anymore and eat a very balanced diet. I worry all the time if I am feeding myself enough/properly but I don't change anything about what I'm doing because when I think about how I'm living my life I'm doing just fine. I am so aggressively kind to myself now as opposed to how mean I used to be telling myself I didn't deserve to eat. I always just want the best for my health. If I am unhappy about the way I look, I want to change it in a healthy and sustainable manner but also most importantly accept whatever form healthy looks and feels like for ME.

I know this is solely because diet culture has been in my life for the past 20 years and a part of my mind still is hooked onto diet culture and it's honestly disappointing. \n\nHas anyone else experienced conflicting feelings similar to this?", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}
