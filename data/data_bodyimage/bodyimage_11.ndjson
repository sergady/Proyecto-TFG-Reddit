I want to share that with you. \nI'll mention briefly the key points and I'll attach the link. \n\n1. The brain process the face holistically, (as a whole entity) rather than picking it part by part. So the details we focus on most people don't see them at all. \n\n2.the holistic process itself is asymetrical and scans the face from left to right. \n\n3.each side of the face (left then right ) is processed alone with focus on the left side. And due to that way of processing people tend not to notice the difference between the two sides.\n\n4 . Asymetrical faces need slightly more time to process (than completely symetrical faces, because left and right sides are identical) thus making asymetrical faces more memorable and in cases even more attractive.\n\nThe link\n\nhttp://m.nautil.us/issue/13/symmetry/an-experts-guide-to-celebrity-faces", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

It's my favourite song from her album that's coming out early next year, and I hope the video's message will resonate with folks. Here's what Kim had to say about the video, which [you can watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1u1FD5c4GI):\n\n\"I wanted to make a video, where I could 'glow without apologizing,' with other women like me, as extensions of myself. I wanted to be swimming, I wanted to be in formations together on a beach, mystic and ethereal. In the planning stages, as I spoke with people about the treatment for this video, the first reaction was always an immediate, 'How brave of you!' All well-meaning, some would follow by interrogating their initial reaction, or try to soften it. It is rare to see big bodies presented as objects of beauty. It is political to put my fat queer body in a gold bathing suit for the public. But does it have to be?\n\n\"We live in a world that both hates and fears fat bodies. Living in one as an artist, it's impossible to separate my life from my work. Along with a team of queer filmmakers, I made the video for 'Once You Were Wondrous' as an offering of the beauty and splendour of bodies like mine, in celebration, because I needed to.\"", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

The thing is, i was and am not overweight, and most would say i\u2019m somewhat skinny, but i could not see that. these workouts quickly became toxic for me, as i\u2019d beat myself up if i missed a day. i skipped any meal i could; if my family couldn\u2019t find out, i wouldn\u2019t eat. after around a year of that, i stopped working out and controlling what i eat, and i was somewhat happy, but deep down, i still disliked my body. this year, around 2 months ago, i started working out and being conscious about what i eat. it\u2019s been fine, but i still often beat myself up if i miss a day or eat something i shouldn\u2019t have. it\u2019s extremely toxic, but if i stop this cycle, it seems like my body would only get worse.\n\ni\u2019m super insecure about my face as well. all the girls around me are so beautiful, and i\u2019m just not. i know that when my friends compliment me, they don\u2019t mean it. some boys from my class have said that i have a sexy body, but my face is unbearable. i already know that i\u2019m not attractive, and people tell you to ignore those things, but it honestly hurts. even though i don\u2019t care about those people. i can\u2019t change my face, and i simply don\u2019t know how to live with it for the rest of my life.\n\nit also doesn\u2019t help when you have no one to vent to (kinda why i\u2019m posting this here). whenever i express my insecurities to my friends, they always just say things like \u201cyou\u2019re not ugly\u201d, \u201ci\u2019m fat, don\u2019t say you don\u2019t like your body\u201d, comparing me to their insecurities and guilt-tripping me about how i don\u2019t have the right to complain. deep down, i know that they probably think that i\u2019m seeking for attention, but it\u2019s not nice to not be allowed to be unhappy about myself.\n\nwhile i don\u2019t want to waste my time on worrying about how i look, looks are a huge part of our daily life, and it\u2019s really consuming me.\n\nplease drop any advice you can... thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

Such as expectations about the way you present your gender, how to define masculinity and femininity, how you \u201cshould\u201d present your race or ethnicity, how you \u201cshould\u201d fit into your social class, etc. I think that all of that is just meaningless. It doesn\u2019t really contribute a whole lot to society and I actually think you could say that it take takes away from society because it puts people in a made up box. Like because of your expectations you prevent people from expressing themselves.\n\nBut the reason that I\u2019m thinking about this is because my mom was watching a video of Niall Horan\u2019s music video she literally said \u201cdoes he not realize that his gut is sticking out?\u201d and I\u2019m like...you\u2019re kidding me right. Who tf cares if he has a gut or if it\u2019s sticking out? And plus I would have never noticed anything if she hadn\u2019t pointed it out. It\u2019s just part of the older generation I think that everything needs to be a certain way but their way is not the best, in the slightest. \n\nOn a brighter note, I think nowadays that box is becoming at least bigger and hopefully it will fade away to allow anyone to be seen and heard regardless of what they look like. Looks and genes are such a surface level and shallow way to judge someone.

Eating too much\n4. Not enough water\n5. Sleep\n\nAll 5 i just named were ALL of my battles. I had all of them since little, never liked to sleep, and than when i got older it got worse. \nSame with the eating, I'd binge till there's no tomorrow than would go days without food or water.\n\nRecently i dropped 25 pounds\nThe highest I've ever weighed in my life was 262 at 15 years old\nAnd it scared me to DEATH. That number was to never reach any further and i refused to let it. So i took a stand for my health, i already battle with sickel cell and possible arthritis so all that weight on my bones and joints will make it SO much harder for me to function on a day to day basis.\nI am 16 now and weigh 237\n\nI'm not completely in love with my body, but I've learned to love it SINCE i am changing it. Yes i was bullied all my life you already know how that goes, but i never let it cripple me. \n\n I struggled with hating how i looked and than not doing ANYTHING about it and I would be a hypocrite and say \"i wish i was skinny, i wish i looked like her\" and than continue to do bad habits that would cause me to blow up you know? Not on purpose but just out of being SOO stressed with my personal life. Stress and depression are bad toxins that your body doesn't need, so if you have either one or BOTH, you'll blow up without even realizing it until you look at yourself.\n\nSo i stood my ground and got tired of it.

This rash may appear as pimples that come to white tips on the face, chest, back, legs, buttocks, private area. It's usually cause by a bacterial or fungal infection and it can spread and turn into nonhealing, crusty sores and leave really bad scars. You may ask yourself, why I\u2019m so ashamed about this because it\u2019s a common thing for tennagers to have it on their face or back. I really wished I had it where most people have it, but no, unfortunately, I have it on the most uncomfortable parts: my butt and private area. \n\nGrowing up, my body was normal, like everybody else, till i turned 13 and puberty hit me. That\u2019s when all things went crazy. I starting noticing little pimples on my private area and butt. I was waxing so I didin\u2019t know what was the problem. These pimples in time, turned into red bumps that caused me awful pain. I remembered telling my mother about this and she told me it was a normal thing and that I shouldn\u2019t worry about it. But this bumps never healed and left me with permanent purple scars(on my butt) and with red bumps(on my private area). For the first time in my life I felt ashamed of my own body. Going to the beach and seeing girls, my age, havind perfectly normal butts without scars on them made me feel so miserable that I would cry for hours in my room, thinking \u201cwhy I am not like them?\u201d. Years passed till i had the courage to go to a dermatologist and they diagnosed me with folliculitis. I finally had an answear for my condition, but that didn\u2019t helped me a lot. The lotions from my doctor made the bumps go away, but still left me with really bad scars. \n\nThis affected me in so many ways, that when i went to the beach in the summer, I covered up my butt with a towel and i didn\u2019t want to go into the water because i was too afraid that people will see my scars and judge me. When my boyfriend invited me to go with him and his friends to the pool, I refused, because I was so afraid that if he saw my body he will freak out and be disgusted of how i look. My self confidence was really down...I couldn\u2019t even look to myself in the mirror and not feel sad. When I had really sore bumps, I couldn\u2019t even sit properly or not felling itchy down there. I always came up with excuse for my bad mood or why I couldn\u2019t go to the beach or wear certain things. I felt like i was trapped in my own body and I couldn\u2019t escape. \n\nLoving your body it\u2019s such a nice thing that is stole for me everyday just for having this condition. I really feel like I\u2019m the only one dealing with this and want to feel, just for a couple of seconds, like a normal 17 year old girl.

It was while I was having a conversation around the kitchen island with my mother. Now, I have always being a bit chubby and my mom made us go on a thousand diets when I was younger. But that\u2019s only partly relevant. \n\nSo I was having a conversation with my mom and I was just pointing out in conversation how insulting it is when people say to fat girl like my self, how pretty our faces look. As if the face was the only part of my self being deemed worthy of praised as I obviously did not deserve to be simply called pretty because of the rest of my body is unacceptable because of its fat content. My point is, say I\u2019m pretty, point. Or don\u2019t say anything at all.\n\nAnd I kept going with examples of stuff that annoys me, like ; when people say I\u2019d be prettier if I lose weight, and that\u2019s where the punch line comes in. \n\nMy mom, who had not said much till then, (I\u2019d assumed she was agreeing with me you know) but no that\u2019s where he true feeling shines thru when she very simply answers\u2026 \u201cYeah as if you did not already knew\u201d\n\nAnd I was shook. But you know what I did ? \n\nAbsolutely nothing,\n\nBecause that is what us daughters do when our parents hurt our feeling. At least that is what I do. I brush it off thinking they don\u2019t mean anything by it, because surely they love me right? There is no way that they said something to hurt me right?\n\nThat was not the direction my thoughts were going. No mother, I was saying that because I\u2019m sick of people assuming I\u2019d be happier thin. I am happy. I am confident. I was saying that because I thought it was stupid. But now you saying that as if it was a fact made me take a step back and for one second there, I felt like the little lili at 12 years old when you make me step on a scale in front of strangers at a weekly meeting to see if I had been \u201cgood\u201d, if I was to be worthy of a round of applause for not stuffing my chubby little face in \u201cbad foods\u201d this week.\n\nI had to hold my tears back while writing this, and felt so silly and defeated. Because I was there, to the magical place when you do not doubt yourself anymore, at the edge of 30, when you know who you are and don\u2019t need strangers approbation. But for a moment a couple words brought me back to lili of my early twenties where I believed I would be prettier thin and that all my worries would vanish if I did. But you know what, it passes. I started to unfollow every dieter on my Instagram, turned to body positive inspiration like tess holliday and other. I\u2019ve started to consume only what made me feel good.  And this day, I did not cry or flinch, because I know my worth, and I\u2019m over letting people affect me. I meant what I said when I was talking to her, if she misunderstood that is her problem not mine.

I'm new to reddit and I would always go on to find answers to question and finally decided to make an account! \n\nSo this is me looking for answers to resolve my body image issues and spill my soul in a mature and safe environment. So let me start from the beginning. In high school I was a competitive swimmer, and ran for my high schools track and cross country team. I was in pretty good shape, in the sense that I never really thought about my body. I loved going shopping had an amazing wardrobe and loved to dress up and was really into fashion. My first semester in college I swam for my college's swim club for a while, but quit because I realized I didn't have to do it. For about 9 years I did 5 am practices and I think I mainly did it because it was a lifestyle. But when I quit in college I ate EVERYTHING. I only had 2 dining swipes a day and would usually  stay  in the dining hall for HOURS just studying and eating. I would sit for hours and eat eat eat study study study.\n\nAround sophmore year I started noticing the weight gain. I couldn't fit into old jeans or shirts and started dressing in basketball pants and sweaters more often. Eventually it was ALL I WORE. Friends would comment on how I would wear shorts in the winter and hoodies in the summer. By junior year I literally had none of my old clothes because they didn't fit. Everyone started commenting on how I looked \"healthier\" because of the weight gain. I believed them because I was pretty skinny to begin with. \n\nFor my part time job all I had to wear was basketball and a plain t-shirt, and one of my internships was through the computer and the other had a very informal atmoshpere where all I had to wear was, you guessed it, basketball shorts and a plain shirt. I didn't really have to wear proper dress clothes until college graduation. I remember going to the store to buy a formal outfit and everything looked really bad on me. I thought now big deal, just wear dress pants, a t-shirt and my robe over my shirt to cover up the fact that I didn't wear a dress shirt. So I did that. Graduation was great, but this experience was the first time I had a negative experience with my body and clothes. \n\nI decided to take a couple months to unwind before stepping to the real world and kept my college parttime job. After a while I decided to get into the game. I polished my cover letter and resume and applied to jobs. I got five interviews the first week I applied! I was ECSTATIC. I got ready to spend some big bucks on a big boy outfit. I got some cltohes I thought would look nice and to the dressing rooms I headed only to find out I looked fat. I looked in the mirror and was absolutely disgusted. I didn't go to any of the interviews because I looked fat. I weighted myself and found out I gained 60 pounds. \n\nRight now, I'm too scared to apply to jobs because I'm afraid of how I look. I am the first to go to college and the pressure to be successful along with my poor body image is making me depressed. How do I get past this? How do I make myself feel better? I feel worthless and empty.", "subreddit": "BodyImage"}
