I know it\u2019s not true... and I shouldn\u2019t feel this way... but whenever I am not looking my best (at my lowest weight) I feel like it lowers my worth. I guess it\u2019s just so deeply engrained in me by my upbringing/ society/ whatever that a woman\u2019s worth stems from how attractive she is. It\u2019s stupid and I don\u2019t believe that when I look at other women. But I do believe on some unconscious level we all do. Pessimistic as it may sound I do think there is some truth in that. Sure I don\u2019t lose any actual worth when I gain a lb or breakout or whatever but I do think it affects how others value me. Example: my SO\u2019s family comes to mind. This holiday season I felt like all eyes were on me. I hadn\u2019t seen his family in a few months and in that time I put on a few lbs. A couple of people made joking comments about it (nothing intentionally harmful... more like: you can barely tell or it looks good on you) and even though they didn\u2019t mean anything hurtful all I could hear was \u201cwe notice your getting fat and slacking off\u201d. I feel like I am letting them down in some stupid way. I\u2019m embarrassed and ashamed to show my face. I dread every holiday season bc of this. I care that people notice for whatever reason. People care. Especially old people. Idk what it is but there is nothing like a back handed comment from someone\u2019s granny about how \u201cyou\u2019re filling out your jeans better than you were last thanksgiving\u201d \n\nI guess I don\u2019t really have a question.

Wonky face. Wonky skeleton. My eyes are a weird gangrene colour. My hair is a mousy, ashy brown. I struggle, to this day, to find something about my appearance that I like (maybe my pinky nails?).\n\nBut I have come to a point where it doesn't matter. Like... oh, what, people are going to judge my body for what it looks like? Okay? So, and, therefore? People could *choose* to judge my worth as a person on other things. They could judge me for my humour, my joy, my love for simple things like leaves falling from trees and Christmas lights. They could judge me for my willingness to listen to other people's problems, my ability to analyze and help people when they are too emotional to understand what's happening in their lives. Judge me on my fortitude, my warmth, my unwavering desire to create. You can even judge me for my poor qualities - my messiness, stubbornness, cruelty or recklessness. But... if you choose to judge me over the circumference of my THIGHS, that means I'm doing really well. If there's nothing else to judge me about, then I figure I'm doing alright.\n\nAs for my own dislike of my body, I have gotten to the point where aesthetics have ceased to matter too much. Fat legs, but do I walk? Long torso,  but does my spine still hold my body up? Chubby tummy, but are my organs protected? My body performs a function and it does so exceptionally well (except for my asthmatic lungs, but we can't be perfect and bless them they're trying). My body doesn't exist to look pretty and pleasing to the eye. It exists to keep me alive. So that I can enjoy those falling leaves and Christmas lights, so that I can help my friends, so that I can be warm and cruel and analytic. I have an intrinsic worth as a human being that is completely separate from what my body and face look like: they are just the support system to keep me alive. And for me, that has given me a *huge* amount of peace of mind. \n\nYes, my thunder thighs are huge, but thank you, thighs, for supporting the rest of my weight. Yes, my tummy is chubby, but thank you for keeping my organs safe &amp; being there in case I fall on hard times. Yes, my spine is hella crooked, but thank you spine for still holding me up as much as you can. Weird, misaligned eyes, but I can still see my mom's smile. Yes, my lungs function terribly (really, it's a problem... should probably revisit my physician about it...), but they are still working to keep me breathing. I am grateful for the body I have, because it means I can enjoy life.\n\nAnd I find that if you can start to lead your thought process down \"body means I can enjoy life\" rather than \"body means I don't enjoy life\", it can do wonders for you. It takes a long time and it will hurt, bad. I'm 25 now and couldn't have done this 10 years ago, or even 5. I spent so much of my youth believing I was missing out on life while I was fat/ugly, I didn't realize that I WAS living life. Like, I was just doing it, while thinking that it was impossible for me to do it. And now that I'm armoured with this knowledge, nobody can stop me from enjoying myself. Like... you can throw your trash at me and tell me I'm too fat to live as I walk down the street all you like, but I'm still going to laugh with my friends in the Silly Accessories section of the store on the corner, I'm still going to cry at the sad ending of the movie but watch it again the next week, I'm still going to eat a slice of cake on my birthday and I'm still going to live life. \n\nMaybe I'm just rambling at this point (another negative you can judge me for, lol), but I just wanted to put this kind of positivity out into the world. I've had such joy and peace of mind with this approach, I just hope it might give somebody else a similar freedom. Go. Live life. Dance down the street, sing terrible show tunes, laugh loudly.\n\nYou're already living life. Why not sit back and enjoy it?", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

It\u2019s so hard for me to accept myself. Some days I think I\u2019m attractive and I like what I see in the mirror, but on other days (like today), I feel upset about things about my face. For example, I don\u2019t know how I feel about my side profile. When I was younger, around 12 or 13, I hated it. Something was weird about it. Now, I always take photos of my side profile to figure out if I think it\u2019s attractive or not. \n\nAnyway, someone said something to me that just crushed me. I met someone for the first time and she asked, \u201coh did you go to [insert my high school\u2019s name] prom?\u201d And I was like \u201cyeah! How did you know?\u201d And she was like \u201cI remember seeing you.\u201d And I was like, \u201coh, how did you recognize me?\u201d And she said, \u201cYou have a very memorable face.\u201d \n\nThis may sound like I\u2019m overthinking, but there have been studies that prove that unattractive faces are the most memorable. And, based on my own experience, all the faces I\u2019ve seen that are memorable are faces with very distinct features. However, I don\u2019t think my face is distinct or unique at all. I\u2019m brunette, 1/4 latina, and people constantly say I look like the most normal looking brunette girls. People say I look like kendall Jenner, Selena Gomez, and basically any normal looking brunette girl or Hispanic girl. Random people on the streets have come up to me saying I look like their daughter (usually their daughters are brunette and normal looking). \n\nSorry if this sounds like I\u2019m hyper focused on my appearance, I don\u2019t mean to be. It\u2019s just a constant struggle. I ask myself: am I ugly? Is my side profile so ugly that it makes my face memorable? I don\u2019t know what to do. I go to therapy, but I feel as though it is not enough. I have mental breakdowns every couple of days because I feel so heart broken and completely devastated over my appearance. In the grand scheme of things, I know I\u2019m not ugly. If anything, I\u2019m average level. But, sometimes I feel like parts of my face are hideous. Sure, maybe the rest of my face is normal and it balances out the ugly parts, but the ugly parts to me are so ugly. I feel a deep, dark pain over this. And I need help and support. I came here hoping for some answers and guidance. All I want is to be normal looking. Please help me.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

None of this has helped.\n\nIt\u2019s always been clear that my little sister was going to be the \u201cpretty one\u201d, and that didn\u2019t bother me until recently. At 14 she started wearing my old bras, and recently she\u2019s quite obviously overtaken me in the boobs department. Around the house she wears what is essentially underwear - bralets and shorts/sweatpants - and it\u2019s hard not to notice that she has a hell of a lot more cleavage than I do. This is upsetting because my body image swings so much from being happy with how I look to really hating myself, and my much younger sister having bigger boobs than me has turned out to be a massive issue for me.\n\nObviously, my sister can wear what she likes in her own home, and as an adult I should just try to get over it. A side point is that she has shown some signs of having body image issues herself (although I\u2019m not sure if this is just me projecting).

It just hurts. My weight has fluctuated a lot over the past few years. Fighting depression has caused me to gain and lose weight but I never make any real progress.\n\nI went to another cousin\u2019s wedding in September, and my aunt just looked at me and was like \u201cYou need to lose weight. Seriously, you need to lose weight.\u201d And she said that over and over again, repeatedly, in front of my mother, my other aunts, and my cousins. It was hurtful and embarrassing. I was the only one trying to stick up for myself but it\u2019s hard to when you\u2019re alone in doing so and on the verge of crying. My cousins who don\u2019t believe in body shaming didn\u2019t say anything. My mom agreed with her and said it\u2019s because I drink too much bubble tea LOL.

I'm not trans, I've actually liked feminine things all my life and only ever had thoughts of wanting to a boy to escape how women are seen and the roles we are expected to play in this messed up world.  I definitely don't want to have a dick, I think they are one of the ugliest and most disgusting things to ever exist in this world and I feel this way despite being straight and 20 now.(maybe im ace sexual).  I've hated having boobs ever since puberty, to the point that I prayed to have small boobs.\n\n Unfortunately for me I hit puberty at 10 and it was a nightmare. Not only was I having painful period cramps but every time I looked in the mirror and saw my chest getting bigger I felt disgusting. I would try very hard not to look down at my body in the shower. Now that I'm older it's gotten better but my disgust with breasts is still there. They are so pointless to me, especially because humans are the only mammals where the females have breasts even before pregnancy. I read an article that discussed why females have breasts and the conclusion they came to is that it was just to attract males which just made it that much more disgusting to me. I also hate that i'm short and small framed so everyone underestimates me and If they see me standing up for myself  i'm described as \"feisty\" or \"sassy\"(i really hate those words now). It's like I can never be seen as powerful or strong or dominant and If i try it's just \"look at the tiny girl being feisty\". It seems like this world and everything in it was created by a cruel  God that only made it for men and as women we are forced to be in roles we can't escape. I know people will likely say that I shouldn't hate my body just because of society's mindset but when is that going to change? The world has always been like this for women and feminism only gave us rights it didn't give us  much respect or change the way men see us. I think it's  only natural for me to hate my body given the world we live in.\n\n I guess I just wanted to rant about this and maybe look for some advice.

Over the course of a 12-week program, the app helps users gain skills to target BDD symptoms through CBT exercises on their phone. Users are also paired with a coach who offers support throughout the program and answers any questions or concerns they may have.\n\nWe are conducting an ongoing research study to test how well *Perspectives* works in terms of improving BDD symptoms and related mental health symptoms.\n\nAfter an initial pilot trial, we are now opening the study up to more people to further test the app\u2019s potential benefits. We hope that developing and testing this CBT for BDD app will give many more people access to treatment.\n\nWe are looking for people with BDD in the United States who might benefit from this smartphone-based therapy, to use the app in our clinical trial, at no cost to them.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more, you can find the details on our website: [https://perspectives.health/](https://perspectives.health/)\n\nAlternatively, you can always email me directly at [bdd@partners.org](mailto:bdd@partners.org).\n\nI hope it can be of some help!!", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

My sex drive is higher than his, so I think this is mainly a concern for me.\n\nAgain I know this probably sounds vain and silly, but I would rather confront and acknowledge these issues now before it\u2019s something I can\u2019t go back from.\n\nThank you \ud83d\ude25", "subreddit": "BodyImage"}

When I was a teenager, I was an elite athlete, and then I stopped competing and learned how to exercise for the joy of it. Nowadays I do it all - running, weight lifting, yoga, Pilates, pole dancing, HIIT, whatever feels good on any given day. Over the past year, my bra size and pants size changed, and it really threw my body image for a loop, as a lot of my clothes no longer fit. I've been working on my attitudes around this, and I'm in an OK head space about it.\n\nLast week I had two friends over to help me Kon-Mari my clothes. A lot of stuff had to go. We were discussing the perils of having big boobs and wearing button down shirts, and one of my friends made some weirdly dismissive comments. She was like \"Why don't you keep complaining about your perfect porn star boobs and firm athletic butt, wow, what a horrible thing to have to deal with! Your boyfriend must HATE it!\" \n\nI know she meant it as a joke, but it really bummed me out and got into my head. I'm 5 foot 2 and a 32F bra size, so I'm already self-conscious about my bust. But also, I think I just naturally gain muscle easily when I work out. And I don't work out to \"make that booty pop,\" as it were; compound lifts like squats make my body strong and make me feel accomplished and proud. \n\nI don't think my friend realizes that I've had a rough go of it with my attitude about my body. When I was at my fittest competing in triathlons, my body wasn't good enough unless it was winning races. It was literally just a victory vehicle and if I wasn't winning and getting PRs all the time, I HATED myself. Also all the girls who were *really* good were tall and thin gazelle types, not petite and muscular. It took me a really long time to develop a healthy relationship with fitness and body image after quitting that sport.\n\nI also realize that my friend may be feeling some weirdness about herself because she's been going through a lot of changes with her body. She had a baby earlier this year. But it also really bums me out that she's taking any of it out on me.\n\nThose comments cut a lot deeper than I think she understood. It made me feel really awkward and made me question all the body-acceptance progress I've been making lately.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I feel sad because my brain continually reminds me that I'm \"fat\" , despite reassurance from people around me , bearing in mind a lot of people I am friends with are pretty honest in that they'll say what they think , that I don't have an issue with my weight. It really upsets me because my friend went to London a few days ago and we met up yesterday and when I asked her what she had for lunch she said she had had a toasted sandwich, a packet of crisps , a hot chocolate and a cake.  Which if this was a few years ago , I would have been able to eat all that without feeling like shit about myself but on the contrary when we went to a coffee shop yesterday all I had was a small box of fruit (literally about 5 small pieces of melon, 2 pieces of pineapple and 3 grapes) and a bottle of diet soda, whilst my friend is sat there with a creamy chocolate drink and a packet of crisps.  It also upsets me because the way I see it is that everyone views me as a weak, low motivated, pity-seeking human, but no one understands how difficult it is to let yourself eat what your heart wants you to eat not what your head is telling you to eat. I know I'm chubby/chunky , sure , but people like bodyposipanda and Tess Holliday , are both quite significantly larger than me in body size and although I'm sure they have lots of days when they feel like shit and feel insecure , I'm sure on other days they try and remain positive and they don't stay at home all day because they feel too disgusting to leave the house . So if they are larger than me and are trying to get the most out of what they have to use it to inspire and motivate others , why can't I have a good emotional quality of life? I also feel panicky because it's nearly Christmas , hence meaning that there is a tonne of less than healthy food in our kitchen and I feel like I'm not going to be able to control myself , even though I think I can have good control over food choices sometimes . The last thing is that I feel that if I express my concerns about possible having an eating disorder to someone , they'll laugh in my face because I'm simply too fat to possibly have any chance of suffering an eating disorder .

Also sorry for weird formatting, I\u2019m on mobile \n\nI\u2019m not too sure how to cope or set boundaries when it comes to getting pictures taken of me. I hate how I look so much, in fact the only good qualities I have are my eye color, eyelashes, hair color, and lip color. Everything else is too ugly for me to feel confident in. My self hatred runs so deep that looking in mirrors or seeing any pictures of me (whether taken or selfies) makes me feel disgusted. I can just stop taking selfies, and I really only need mirrors for brushing my hair and teeth and washing my face. But pictures??? They\u2019re harder to get around. \n\nMy dad is a photographer and always wants to take pictures of everyone, myself included. I don\u2019t know how to say I don\u2019t want a picture because my parents know that I\u2019m not confident, but if they knew how deep it ran they\u2019d be shocked. So I let him take pictures of me and I cringe every time it has to happen. It\u2019s been like this for years, too.\n\n Every yearbook picture has been from the waist up, which only adds insult to injury since I hate my entire torso. Every group picture I\u2019ve been in I have hated. Most of the time, if I\u2019m in a group picture with my class, I\u2019ll hide. The order is tall people in the back and I\u2019m 5\u201910 so I go to the back, and once there are enough people in front, i duck so I won\u2019t be seen. \n\nOne time, my friend took a picture of me. I started crying because I looked disgusting so I asked him to delete it. He didn\u2019t. (Yeah He was an asshole and I haven\u2019t talked to him in years now) \n\nRecently, I went to volunteer at a food bank with my class, it was really nice and i loved it. My teacher who I hate, walked up to me and my two friends and asked to take a picture. I set a boundary. I spoke up for myself and said \u201cI don\u2019t like pictures\u201d A clear no. It was clear as day that I was uncomfortable with the notion. Guess how this leech responded??? She said \u201cawww come on, I have to get pictures though.\u201d  I hesitated, but seeing as I have anxiety and didn\u2019t wanna cause a scene, I reluctantly hesitated and she took a picture of me. \n\nThis just brings me here. I hadn\u2019t set boundaries on pictures and didn\u2019t want them taken of me, but since I was saying yes to pictures, I couldn\u2019t blame the person taking them for taking them. But the one time I\u2019ve ever set a boundary on pictures, it got disrespected and thrown away and I got an unwanted picture taken of me anyway. How am I supposed to say that I don\u2019t want pictures taken of me??? Especially when people ignore it and take a picture against my will anyway???? I mean, my self hatred is so bad that I show visible distress when seeing a picture of me. I get panic attacks when I randomly see how I look when I\u2019m not ready to. It\u2019s so bad and no one understands just how bad my self hatred is. I just really need to figure out how to set boundaries because if I get another hideous unwanted picture of me, I\u2019ll cry and have a mental breakdown :( Thanks for reading this long post, any advice is helpful just don\u2019t be mean because I will also cry.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I've struggled with all of the above for a long time, and have been receiving professional help. Despite the weekly therapy, and a very loving wife (29f) I still struggle mightily with these issues. I find myself easily triggered into worrying about them, and it affects my overall quality of life quite a bit. \n\nWe've been together for going on 9 years now and married for 6 months, and have known other since freshman year of college. Despite that, I still sometimes slip into the fear that she'll leave me for someone with a more desirable body, larger penis, and overall attractiveness. Or even if she doesn't, that she actually wants someone with these qualities despite telling me she doesn't. \n\nI'm relatively fit: I grew up boxing and transitioned to weight lifting and now cycling and climbing, and work out at least 4 times a week. Despite that and a good diet, I'm not really toned or muscular, just athletic and healthy looking, and I'm only 5'7. For lack of a better descriptor, I look fairly stereotypically Jewish (which I am) and have a large nose. While I know it's the low end of average, my penis is only 5ish inches erect, and not terribly girthy. \n\nI hate my body and always find things wrong with it. When I see myself in the mirror (or another guy in the locker room or in porn), I compare myself unfavorably, and judge my own looks against theirs, especially in regards to penis size. I worry frequently that she wants someone larger, even if she says mine is good enough for her. I know how dumb it sounds, but I worry that \"good enough\" isn't \"best\". The fact that she works incredibly long weeks, and our sex life is currently slow doesn't help. Nor does the fact that to her knowledge she's never had an orgasm (which I feel awful for her about because I know it bothers her sometimes). \n\nIt's crazy to think that after previous sexual partners, and the long relationship with my now-wife, I'm still so hung up on this. \n\nCan I get some input from other posters?
