Salience: the degree to which self-relevant appearance information is brought to consciousness.\n2. Valence: The evaluation of our appearance in a positive or negative way.\u00a0\n\nIf we understand the components of appearance self-schema, we will be able to identify the individuals that might be more prominent to suffer appearance distress and help to change their perceptions. Thus, body image concern usually is associated to women, so it is important that practitioners recognise the existence of these issues in men and understand how to assist men. The aim of the present online survey is to explore body self-appearance perception and the impact on fear of negative evaluation. The study takes place entirely online and consists of a 15 minutes single session in which participants are simply asked to fill out some questionnaires.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your time!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you would like to have more information about the study or if you have any question, please contact:**Susana Alarcon Jimenez (**[**Susana2.AlarconJimenez@live.uwe.ac.uk**](mailto:Susana2.AlarconJimenez@live.uwe.ac.uk)\\*\\*)\\*\\*The University of the West of England, Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences, Frenchay Campus, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol, BS16 1QY - 0117 965 6261", "subreddit": "BodyImage"}

I'm a 21 year old female, weighing about 150 pounds and I'm 5'2\". All of my life, growing up, I was small. I stayed around 30 pounds underweight for my age and height most of my life. I was shamed for my size by friends and family, who told me I was just skin and bone. When I started college, I was 90 pounds, still 30 pounds underweight. I ate a lot and never gained the weight. My sophomore year of college, I went through a bad break up and started to cut back on eating. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, which I struggle with today. I met my now husband in 2016, weighing at 95 pounds and eating one meal a day. \nObviously, I now weigh more and I'm getting criticism for it. My mom has been overweight all of her life, but has just recently lost a lot of weight. I am super proud of her for doing that. However, I feel like she's using that as leverage against me to... well, I don't really know her aim. I don't believe in jean sizes because I can fit in an 8 in one brand and a 12 in another. I bought some new pants at a thrift store (16s) and visited my mom today wearing them. She looked at me in dismay and after a moment said: \"Do you realize I'm wearing 16s now and going down to 14s? Just how big are you planning to get?\"\n\nI wake up and go to bed not wanting to look at myself naked because I feel disgusting. I've gained stretch marks because of my weight. I have scars in addition from self harm. My husband loves me and tells me I look my best since he's met me, but my brain refuses to believe it. I'm so sick of feeling this way. I never feel confident in my \"cute\" clothes. I don't eat healthy because I have issues with texture, so I blame myself for all of it. I want to tell myself I'm beautiful and that I don't need to be skinny, but it's hard when I'm hearing this from my own mother. \n\nI don't know what to believe anymore. I've stumbled back into hurting myself because of this, on top of just being married, working, and being a full time stupid. \n\nHow do I pull myself out of this? I just want to be happy. \n\nI'm sorry for the long post. I hope whoever reads this has a great day~", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

It\u2019s quite the contrary, actually. But before you go screaming that I\u2019m a skinny, privileged white girl,  listen to what I say.\n\nI was a chubby kid. When I was around the age of 9-10, I was around 147 cm (4\u201910\u201d ) with a weight of about 49.8 Kg (110 lbs). I have wretched memories of being bullied by people who I thought I was close too, and I began to lose self confidence because of that.\n\nPuberty hit me at the age of 10, and I became a solid 162 cm (5\u20194\u201d) with a weight of 52.1 Kg (115 lbs) in only a short few months. I was still stared at because I was tall for the age group (not anymore) and I also weighed significantly more than the people who were only 40.8 Kg (90 lbs). As I began to secondary school, I started to fit more with my peers. \n\nAround August of last year I weighed around 53.9 Kg (119 lbs), and I was fine with that at the time, but the farther we get from August, the lower and lower my weight get. I\u2019m 50.8 Kg (112 lbs) currently (and it\u2019s still dropping). I know that some people would kill to be this skinny, but it\u2019s not good when your own family thinks you\u2019re anorexic. I will admit it\u2019s on me for not eating as much as I should, and I blame only myself for that.\n\nI\u2019m currently trying to simply keep my weight from continuing to fall.

I've expressed concerns about my body to people before and I've always been told \"BUT YOU'RE SO SKINNY\".\n\nYeah, I guess I am, but I also feel like my body is falling apart, and I'm not even 30.\n\nA lot of these issues are things I've had for a decade or more, and are starting to catch up with me. I have scoliosis caused by one leg shorter than the other, so my spine  bends and twists a little, pushing my lower ribs out sort of like two horns, and meaning that one of my hips and shoulders is higher and more prominent than the other. My other shoulder also has a bump on the end of it, presumably due to an injury I suffered when I was a child. To this day that arm (my dominant one) is 15% weaker than the other, and I don't have full range of movement. My trouble with my spine has also caused my to have problems with my jaw, as well as some rather disgusting bowel problems.\n\nI'm looking into these problems now, but it... sucks to find out about there's not to much which can be changed. As a kid and even as a younger adult I coped with my body insecurities by hiding myself away in big baggy jumpers (even in the summer). Can't see my dodgy ribs or shoulders if I hide them, nananana!\n\nI don't want to live like that anymore.\n\nNot least because I've come out as trans. I was assigned male at birth and it's been a long road for me to accept my gender. Honestly I feel like the reason I didn't accept I was trans when I was younger was because I felt discomfort with my body. Even outside of my \"deformities\", I'm almost 200cm tall, with a long torso, giant hands and feet, and what feels like an oversized head compared to my body. Compared to the image of transwomen I saw in the media as cute and petite, I used to feel like I was some sort of seperate species of human, a *Homo weirdensis*.\n\nAnd so I acted out as weird. When I'm not being shy and reserved I'm massively exuberant and loud, like I'm trying to overcompensate for my low self worth.\n\nI do feel more comfortable in my gender now, but I still struggle to think of myself as someone who could be sexually appealing. I can think of myself as \"funny\", \"cute\" or \"silly\", but \"sexy\" feels absolutely beyond me. I know I would struggle to show my chest (and never my shoulders) to anyone. My bowel problems mean that, if I get a partner, I'll only be able to have oral sex with them. On many days I still feel like everything below about my eyelevel is absolutely pants, even though people swear blind to me that my body issues aren't noticeable. It's especially hard when the advice for being trans and the advice for body acceptance smash together.\n\nTrans: Change yourself to fit how you want to be!\n\nBody acceptance: Love yourself as you are, you're perfect\n\nWell... no, I'm not.

I don't even know how to describe it?   \nIt's all the more prevalent when going into a plus size shop, or surfing plus size websites online and someone sees- And I get weird looks from people like \"What're you doing going in there or looking at that?\"   \nLike I shouldn't be anywhere near those types of stores, because they're \"not for me\"  \nAnd then similarly if I go to regular clothes places - I yet again, get weird looks like \"What're you doing? A crop top, for your body?

At the beginning of that relationship, I was fourteen years old and I was pretty thin (or \u201caverage sized\u201d I guess) because my metabolism hadn\u2019t caught up to me quite yet. A year or two passed by and I gained fifty pounds. It happened so suddenly I didn\u2019t even notice it right away.\n\nMy ex boyfriend told me he loved my body, and I felt so lucky because I felt like no one else would be capable of loving my body. I developed a lot of stretch marks on my stomach after I gained all of that weight. He said he still loved my body, and I\u2019m sure he did, but ever since I gained all of that weight I felt like he was lying. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I think stretch marks are beautiful and they\u2019re also just natural! However, the bodies you see on Instagram or twitter or whatever usually don\u2019t have any visible stretch marks. Even if they do have stretch marks, they\u2019re usually faded quite a bit and you can\u2019t even see them that well. It makes me feel like having stretch marks is unnatural and something to hide. I never wear crop tops and I always have my jeans high waisted. \n\nI hate that I care so much about what other people think of me. I personally am not picky about people\u2019s body types and I rarely even notice anyone\u2019s body. But I still feel like everybody\u2019s looking at me because I\u2019m not super thin or \u201cslim thick\u201d lol.

(Rant ahead)\n\n\nI know I look kinda okayish. Really, it isn't THAT bad. Also I wasn't always a person so invested in outer appearance.\nUltimately, this lead to a lot of bullying, because I didn't care about myself properly.\n\nNow I do but I am stuck in a work environment where the woman I work with seem to be very superficial. I am good friends with one of them and know they are not all about being beautiful! But I can't fail to recognize that looks and 'things' (and vacations and stuff like that) are the things those woman talk a lot about. They talk about it in regards of themselves but also about others.\nIt's a constant topic.\n\nAlso, they are all really beautiful, and I don't say that just because of low self esteem but when standing next to them I feel like I don't fit in. And I feel this immense pressure to 'get there'.\n\nThey all have clear skin, long hair, nice teeth and are skinny. I'm the complete opposite.\nI have acne scars and dull looking skin, short unhealthy hair, my front teeth are kinda going inwards (+ I can't and also kinda don't want to pay that much to get them fixed) and I am overweight.\n\nI am no beauty and I always thought that was ok and I could live with it but being in the presence of these woman I feel soooo inadequate. They seem to live exciting lives and also seem to be liked well and I can't not think that it has to do with their looks, at least a little bit.\n\nIn short, I envy them. I kind of want to be like them. But it kinda doesn't feel right, doesn't feel like 'me'.\nBut I'm afraid of not fitting in and people looking down at me for not doing that much to look better. I am no slob and I take good care of myself but I just have some features that don't necessarily make me look beautiful objectively.\n\nStrangers of reddit, how do I deal with this? I really like the workplace and it also doesn't seem really toxic, it's just the pressure I feel in myself without even knowing if it's appropriate.\nIt would be so nice if you could help me navigate this situation, since I think it has to do a lot with myself. \n\n\nWhat are some mindsets I should adapt so I can not feel pressured to keep up with them and feel more comfortable with my 'not-as-pretty' - self?\n\n\n\nTl;dr: I feel intimidated and pressured by pretty people.

You are ENOUGH. You are worthwhile regardless of what\u2019s happening on the outside. I think it's important to be kind to yourself and cognizant of your thoughts - but also to realize that there will be occasions where some circumstances make it difficult to take care of yourself the way you would like to, in which case, just do the best you can in those moments and seek out support from those closest to you.

I want to talk about what it's been like.", "author": "FatLogicThrowaway336", "self_text": "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatlogic/comments/7p66e4/im_struggling_very_badly_with_binge_eating/)    \n\nIt's been a while since my post, so hopefully people remember me, I got a lot of PMs and comments and stuff so it seemed like I should update, especially because a lot has happened.  \n\nI just want to start out by saying that everyone was so nice, I love this subreddit and I've felt really welcomed here by everyone. I got so many encouraging messages and so many people in my corner and that really helped me a lot when I was struggling really bad.  \n\nThat being said, I want to be up front that my update is going to be controversial, I'm sure. So I'll just come out with it: I had weight loss surgery. I'm not here to debate the merits of weight loss surgery with anyone, so if that's your goal just walk away, please. I already had it, so I'm not getting talked out of it, and I'm really, really happy I did it, so you won't hear anything negative from me.  \n\nSo my post ended with me attempting to go to a weight loss program at the hospital I work for and getting turned away for my binge eating disorder. That sucked. I ugly cried in front of the dietician that was talking to us and felt like giving up.  \n\nAfter I picked myself back up I decided to try again to find a therapist. I had actually tried to do this several times during my weight gain and had not been successful. I'd asked my family doctor and my regular therapist for recommendations and they had none. I had also just looked up therapists in my area and the few that I found did not take my insurance. However this time around I did actually find someone. My therapist was a formerly obese man who had binge eating disorder and primarily treated patients for eating disorders. I only saw him a handful of times but he really challenged a lot of the ideas I had about food and thankfully I stopped binging almost right away. A lot of the things I had been doing to deal with the binge eating on my own had actually been fueling the binges. Calorie counting with an iron grip, denying myself all kinds of foods, and viewing food as the enemy and evil had really warped my mind. \n\nUnfortunately, the therapy helped a lot with the binging but I did not lose weight. In fact, it felt nearly impossible to lose weight because he had cautioned me against further calorie counting. He really wanted me to practice intuitive eating, which I did, but my weight kind of just leveled off. I ended up at 343 pounds as my highest.  \n\nAbout six months after I ended therapy with him, I started to entertain the idea of weight loss surgery. I'd been really, really staunchly against it in the past. I work in healthcare and I've seen my fair share of failures. I felt like, if you still have to have so much discipline for it to work, then what's the point? But I had a coworker that had had surgery, and she was really happy with it, over ten years out and still thin. And my mother in law also had surgery and is over five years out and much much happier and healthier. \n\nI did a lot of research and talked to my husband about it extensively and we decided we both wanted to do it. We picked a surgeon in August and started the process. As part of the approval process, they wanted us both to see a psychologist. Most people see the psychologist once or twice but I opted to see him on an ongoing basis. In fact I'm still seeing him. His help was immeasurable, even though I had stopped binging I was still emotional eating and he really helped me get to the bottom of it. I also saw an exercise physiologist, a dietician, and followed a weight loss program for several months before being approved. \n\nMy husband had surgery in December and I had surgery in January of this year. I'm happy to say that he went from 299 to 220 in that time, and I've gone from 343 to 275. This is truly the best thing I ever did. My life has improved dramatically and my relationship with food is so much better. I eat like I always wanted to be able to eat, but couldn't because of all the mental health issues, fucked up hunger cues and gigantic stomach. My sugar addiction is gone, I no longer have reactive hypoglycemia or get constant yeast infections. I can reach my butthole again lol! But honestly even if it weren't for all of that, I finally feel relief. I don't feel ruled by food anymore. I don't obsess about food. I don't hate every second I'm eating healthy food. The voice in my head is finally quiet. I've never in my life had this much control over food. It's amazing.  \n\nSo anyway, if anyone is interested in following my progress, my weight loss username is u/NothingLikePoetry. I haven't posted any progress pictures of myself yet (just my husband), but I plan to when I feel like I have something worth showing off. My goal weight is 150 pounds and for the first time in a long, long time I feel like I might actually be able to get there. ", "subreddit": "fatlogic"}

So undesirable, that even *my own self* doesn\u2019t like me.\nI just can\u2019t view myself in the same light that I view everyone else in. And I wish I could, because the feelings and opinions I hold for other people are amazing things to feel. It makes *me* feel good to feel these things for others. Almost as if there\u2019s this brightness, floating around my body. As if seeing their spark, has ignited something in me. I could only imagine that holding those same feelings about myself would be out of this world. But it\u2019s just not possible.

I've fled my abusive family 7 months ago and I've cut contact with them ever since. It's been very stressful and I'm burried in debt now. That has made me very depressed, and stressed out on top of having depression already and other mental health problems. I've migrated to another country,  I have 0 friends here and that has just worsened my loneliness and stress. That gave my a lot of acne, so my coping mechanism was picking them. Because of that, I have a lot of scarring on my face and has made me even more depressed. I look even more awful than usually rn and I don't have the money to fix my skin. I already avoid mirrors at all costs just to avoid seeing my ugly face and body, but the scarring made it ten times worse. I don't even wanna leave the house anymore. I'm in shambles. \n\n\nAgain, I'm very sorry if this post isn't appropiate.

{"post_id": "b76coa", "created_utc": 1553914927, "title": "Beating my Eating Disorder with Humor", "author": "clarelandis", "self_text": "I\u2019m in rehab for the third time. Yes, three times in three years. This might go without saying, but, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Eating disorder rehab is not nearly as fun as it sounds, and, yes, I know it sounds like a damn party. I managed to land myself in this last treatment center after a phase of a bulimia-esque eating disorder and then a brief, but severe flair of my old pal anorexia. Let me tell you, some crazy shit goes down at these places.\n\nThe first time I went to treatment, it felt a bit like I would imagine going to jail would feel. You\u2019re searched, censored, locked in, and stripped. Well, the stripping was a me thing. It was an accident too. The nurse doing my intake assessment showed me behind a curtain and told me to take my clothes off for the examination. Shaking and pale from the nerves, I thought she said something, but I didn\u2019t process it. Uncomfortably, I undressed, slid my clothes and shoes out from the little stall, or rather, circle on the floor encircled by a yellow curtain that was clearly meant to be cheery but just looked gross, so they could be searched, and stepped out for my exam buck-ass nude. The nurse looked confused to see me with one arm over my boobs and the other hand cupped in front of my lady parts. I think I blocked out what happened after that out of sheer embarrassment. She said something nice, and I turned around to see that she had in fact handed me a gown. In my defense, the gown was essentially transparent, so I would\u2019ve been basically naked anyway. Great start.\n\nTreatment is a microcosm of the real world. Except it\u2019s way worse and filled with craziness. I mean crazy in the most endearing way, at least for most people. There was the one girl I went to treatment with who stood over her roomate while she slept and watched her. Or the other one who wrote in her journal that she wanted to kill all of the other people in the building; I was pretty scared of her already, and after finding out she wanted my scalp, I steered clear of her. When we did interact, I was always super nice. I\u2019m always super nice when I think someone wants to kill me, which actually happens a lot because I\u2019m neurotic and paranoid like that. Especially in high school, I went out of my way to be nice to the scary kids because I didn\u2019t want to end up dead, well, junior and senior year I didn\u2019t want to be dead. My high school experience needs its own blog, so I won\u2019t get into it now.\n\nBut in all seriousness, I\u2019ve met some of the best humans in treatment. Not that I would recommend going so that you can make friends, just FYI. I think it has to do with the fact that we share everything with one another and all have this common understanding because our minds are fucked-up in similar ways. There\u2019s something so comforting about meeting someone who is just as fucked-up as you are. Suddenly, this stranger makes your isolated existence not so lonely any more. I was shocked to find out there were people just like me because I was sixteen the first time I went to treatment, and for sixteen years prior, I didn\u2019t think it was possible for anyone else to understand me. I thought I was this one lonely alien-like being. I met my best friend in the whole world when I went to treatment the first time, and, unlike yours truly, she\u2019s killing this recovery thing. She lives in Pennsylvania, and although we don\u2019t talk all that much, we\u2019re incredibly close. When you go through something as terrifying as your first round of treatment with someone, there\u2019s an instant connection and it\u2019s so strong.\n\nIt\u2019s been a journey over the last six years with my eating disorder, but it hasn\u2019t lacked moments of humor. For those of you who are blessed enough not to know anything about treatment, there are these things called flush checks which are the disgusting and dehumanizing moments when a staff member has to look in the toilet before you flush it to make sure you\u2019re not vomiting. One of my friends took a baggie full of soil from a potted plant and dumped it into the toilet before her flush check. She then complained about her stomach hurting and said she didn\u2019t know what was going on. The staff member was terribly confused and concerned. Eventually, he got to the bottom of it and the plants were removed from the facility for the rest of her stay. Plants definitely get the short end of the stick in these places. No one cares about the damn plants. There was a plant in the corner of the caf\u00e9 here, but it\u2019s gone now because one of my friends decided to water it with her boost. Boost is this stuff that is exclusively consumed by eating disorder patients and really old people and is essentially liquid food replacement, definitely not plant food. It actually tastes pretty good, but it kills your stomach. The famous boost bomb is a real phenomenon.\n\nSo, I\u2019m at my third treatment center and really should\u2019ve gotten the hang of recovery by now, but whatever. I\u2019ll get it when I get it or I won\u2019t get it ever, not sure which one yet. This is my last stay in treatment because I\u2019m so ready to go on and have a life. I'm so ready that I even started a blog about it (This Crazy Beautiful Life) I don't know if it will go anywhere or not, but my therapist told me I needed a damn hobby that wasn't self destructive, so I'm trying Reddit too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

To preface, my ED had nothing to do with the way I looked, I used food to punish and control myself. How I physically looked was never a part of my eating disorder for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet now, I am relieved and proud to finally say that I feel fully recovered. However, I have never felt so disconnected from my body. I eat healthy and I exercise regularly. I have plenty of acne scars all across my body but I have relatively few active breakouts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a body that is socially accepted. I used to be extremely skinny as a child and pre-pubescent teenager, and I had an enormous appetite. My appetite was never the same after my ED and same with metabolism. I thought I was skinny, but recently since working out the past 2 months, I went back home after my college spring break and all my family complimented me on toning up but sensing this myself, I asked them if they felt I was skinny, to which they replied they don't consider me skinny anymore. I asked because I don't consider myself skinny anymore. If I'm being honest, at this moment in time I long to be skinny, but more than anything I long for the indifference and lack of awareness I had with my body prior to ever working out consistently this year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's so strange. I went from a size medium to size x-small in tops and feel like I look heavier. I always have fitness goals of wanting to look/have a very specific body type but when I make progress to achieve it, I hate how I look and feel. My clothes don't fit the same and I just don't recognize myself in the mirror.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never judge others' appearance the way I critically pick apart mine. Partly because of how I was raised, beauty was everything to my family and according to them I never had it. I was bullied for being ugly in school. Now that I'm older and in college, it's so strange being cat-called by older men and asked on dates by my peers because they think I'm \"pretty\". I don't value beauty, if someone likes the way I look (which if I'm being quite honest I don't like the way I look) I did not do anything to earn my \"beauty\". I was simply born with certain traits others find desirable. This is why I do not compliment others appearances, at least not so casually.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo this is how I am coming to terms with my ever-changing body as I continue to workout, tone up, get skinner in some areas and thicker in others, or maybe change in ways I do not expect:\n\nI look at myself in the mirror and do not tell myself I am beautiful. That comment does nothing for me. I look in the mirror and tell myself that this is the body of someone who has recovered from a 5 year eating disorder. Who for the past 2 years has tried so hard to aggressively love themself. I tell myself this is the body of someone who is healing, because my whole life my body has only had 1 job that it has consistently done for me: heal me. I admire the strength and years of recovery from mental illness and physical health obstacles it took me to get to this point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd after affirming myself, it doesn't matter what my measurements are. The imperfections on my skin still yet to fade or the cosmetic procedures I have yet to get done. I just admire who I am as a person without the vanity attached. I don't see anything wrong with being vain, that's just not the approach I am taking to learning to accept myself. I hope by sharing this that others can relate or affirm themselves in a way that I do and genuinely feel good about themselves afterwards!
