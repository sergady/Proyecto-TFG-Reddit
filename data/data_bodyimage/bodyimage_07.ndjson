I believe I suffer from body dysmorphia primarily as a result of living in Los Angeles surrounded by impossible (and surgically altered) beauty standards as well as social media always shoving highly curated accounts of perfect looking women in our faces.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have never been the most confident person ever, but lately, it seems to be getting worse. I'm not sure if I've actually gained weight since the last time I felt comfortable in a bathing suit or not. Basically, I'm questioning my reality and if I'm seeing myself as I really am in the mirror. My friends, family, and boyfriend all think I'm way too hard on myself and tell me I'm beautiful.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a very normal weight, some may even say thin, but I just don't see myself that way. I do not suffer from any type of disordered eating. I try to eat as healthy as possible, but indulge fairly often and don't restrict myself much but lately I find myself feeling more guilt surrounding my indulgences and wondering if the women I see with the ideal bodies ever indulge like this, I think to myself that they must not and I should be more disciplined. I'm worried about going down a dark path when it comes to an unhealthy relationship with food, but I wouldn't say I'm quite there yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also don't work out nearly as much as I should and the fact of the matter is that if I did, I probably could easily achieve a body I'm more confident with, but I have the hardest time being motivated and just continue to hate on my body without doing anything about it. I definitely will start working out more just for health reasons and to manage my anxiety, but I'm sure if I got more toned, I'd still find things to be insecure about, so I want to get to the source and find out how to be confident with myself no matter what.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am going to the beach with a bunch of friends on the 4th of July and I want to just be excited to spend time with friends and have fun but instead, I'm panicking about being in a bathing suit. The last time I went to the beach with this crew, I didn't even bring a bathing suit and everyone else was in their suits just enjoying themselves and I was envious of that and not even paying attention to their bodies. I'm sure they all have their own insecurities and no one had \"perfect\" bodies. I decided this time, I want to join everyone else and wear a bathing suit and face my fears.

She didn\u2019t do it intentionally, but she taught me from the very beginning that being conventionally beautiful and thin is the most important thing. She is very harsh about her own body, consistently diets and restricts, and I inherited all of that by watching her.\n\nLast year, around my birthday (August), she and my dad were giving me grief about having gained weight. For context, I was around 100 pounds in high school and most of college. I\u2019m now 24, and I\u2019m 148. I have a small frame, so it\u2019s quite a clear difference.

{"post_id": "c8xrt9", "created_utc": 1562212055, "title": "Adult male, very self-conscious about chest and to a lesser extent, being \"uncut\" down there", "author": "PhilipOliverHoals", "self_text": "I'm an adult male in his 30s. I'm writing this to get some outside perspectives but also perhaps as a catharsis for myself, as I find getting things out there can help in its own way. I've been taking steps in recent years to grow more as a person, and I've made some good progress, but one of my major weaknesses is that I have a pretty low opinion of my own body. This affects me most when it comes to my relations with women.\n\nAnyhow, I've been extremely self-conscious of my chest since around puberty... so I guess that means about 25 years or so :/ My areolae area is much pointier than the vast majority of men, even men who are quite obese and have large \"man boobs\". Even their \"boobs\" are still sort of rounded, whereas I feel my chest is pointy. I feel this is very obvious and I hate how it looks when I wear T-shirts and stuff. Tank tops or \"wife beaters\"? Forget it. No fucking way I am wearing those outside the house. In recent years I've started wearing undershirts most of the time, even in the summer. It does a little to help reduce the visual effect I feel. I'm pretty sure that I just have larger than normal glands for a man, AKA gynecomastia. I can count the number of times I've gone to the beach and/or taken my shirt off in public on one hand.\n\nMy weight fluctuates from being sort of chubby to being in decent/average shape, but even when I've been in very good shape, my chest is still \"pointy\" and it really makes me extremely self-conscious. It also discourages me from staying in shape because I feel like no matter how hard I work out, that is always going to be there ruining the way I want my chest to look. Anytime I hear a casual mention of \"man boobs\" it makes me kind of self-conscious, and it's even more anxiety-inducing if I overhear people (especially women) joking about guys with man boobs, etc.\n\nSome of this is likely tied to a few experiences during puberty, one of which being a few of my friends at the time chasing me around and like grabbing or pinching at my \"boobs\". Another incident was some chick in my class said I should get a training bra :/ Now, I'm all grown up now, but I recently remembered those incidents and it sort of made me bummed out that this never went away even after \"baby fat\" did. I've come to be a \\*little\\* bit more accepting of this as I've gotten older, but there is also a part of me that really wants to save up money and get gynecomastia surgery. Yet another part of me says, \"No, you shouldn't have to do that! You should try and build more confidence!\"\n\nAs for the other thing... I sometimes hate is the fact that I am an American man who is not circumcised. I mean 90% of the time I don't really think about it, but any time I think about maybe wanting to pursue a woman sexually, I do get a bit self-conscious. Perhaps more specifically I hate the fact that people in the US have been brainwashed for over a century to think that being uncircumcised is bad. The worst part is that I know it is completely fine and normal, but that's still not a widely accepted thing in the US... after all, this is how men are born, and all the nonsense about \"it's safer\" or \"it's more hygienic\" is actually complete horse shit/religious propaganda. The vast majority of the world does not circumcise their boys. The facts are that as long as people bath regularly, both sexes genitals are perfectly hygienic.\n\nBut anyway, the reality is that I am not planning to move where uncut penises are basically the norm (Europe and Asia) just to feel comfortable being naked in front of a woman. and it seems American women are generally just grossed out by uncircumcised penises. I have not really felt comfortable mentioning it to women, and in sexual situations, I usually don't request blowjobs or if a girl wants to give me one, I basically hold my dick the whole time in a way that sort of hides that I'm uncircumcised. It's not really that obvious when you're hard anyway, but I'm still paranoid. The exception to this was a woman I dated about 10 years ago... not long after meeting, but before dating officially, the topic of circumcision came up at a party (I know wtf right??) and I quickly mentioned that I wasn't. Her response was one of cautious intrigue, and the next week when I saw her at another party and we were both drunk, she was very flirty and told me that she had Googled uncircumcised penises and she thought that it was kind of sexy. Needless to say, that boosted my confidence through the fucking roof and unsurprisingly she ranks #1 on the list of girls I've dated that I felt the most comfortable around physically.\n\nBut still... It's been so ingrained into the American mindset that it's bad that it's common for it to be joked about in TV or film as if it's this sickening and terrible deformity. I remember an episode of a show from the 90s called Caroline in the City where basically the WHOLE PLOT of one episode revolved around the main characters anxiety/uncertainty about the fact that her new boyfriend was uncircumcised. The whole episode was filled with dumb jokes and all sorts of giggling with her girlfriends about it. Like WOW, way to make an adolescent boy feel even more self-conscious than he already is! Fuck.\n\nAnother more recent example is the film Bad Moms... there is this whole scene of them helping Mila Kunis get ready to go on a date and the one woman is just going ON AND ON AND ON about how awful it would be if her date ends up being uncircumcised... like OH SHIT! That would just be sooooo terrible. I remember watching the film with some family members, including my dad, which was fucking weird because he was laughing his ass off along with everyone else, even though I'm sure that on some level he would know that I wasn't circumcised?? I mean that's a decision my parents made when I was born. So I felt extra self-conscious and awkward with that. I mean look, I know there are jokes about women with \"flappy\" vaginas or whatever you can think of, but yeah... the whole hatred of uncircumcised men can really be discouraging, because I feel that my dick is pretty \"good\" otherwise in terms of length/girth.\n\nIn the end, these two areas of self-consciousness make me self-conscious about being naked in front of a woman. It also makes me shy away from women touching me, especially the chest area. It also makes me self-conscious if I want to perhaps date a smaller breasted women, because I find them to be perfectly beautiful and sexy as any other women, but I worry that they would find my \"man boobs\" sort of weird. I also have never really let a woman have full control of my dick, i.e. letting her stroke it or suck it without me trying to hide the fact I'm uncut. So basically what that all means is that the vast majority of my sexual experiences have been in low light or darkness, and that I was often buzzed or drunk to help me loosen up.\n\nI guess I'm not really sure what I expect from posting this, but perhaps advice from other guys in a similar position would be good, or also thoughts from women about how they perceive guys like this.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- I am self-conscious about my body, especially in situations where being shirtless or naked is expected. Specifically, I'm very self-conscious about having a \"pointy nipples\" AKA gynecomastia, which does not go away even if you get into great shape. The areolae are also sort of large in general imo. Also sort of self-conscious sexually due to having what I consider to be a totally natural dick, AKA I am uncircumcised AND I'm American, where it seems society seems to practically think being uncircumcised is a disgusting deformity or medical problem. Of course the reality is that it's perfectly normal and healthy, but it does still make me less confident sexually because I know that a majority of American women (and men tbh) are misinformed and basically brainwashed to think it's bad. I have basically done everything in my power to hide both my chest and my uncut cock from women, usually by having sex in dim or dark conditions and preventing them from touching me in certain areas without me sort of \"controlling\" them.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I actually think I\u2019ve done pretty well at loving and accepting my body. And I truly know my weight, size, or even physical appearance in general does not determine my worth. \n\nHowever, I have been seeing a guy the past few weeks who is smaller than what I am used to dating or even being around. He is 5\u20198\u201d and is muscular but has a slimmer build. He is great and I am very attracted to him but I can\u2019t help but feel huge next to him. I need some advice on how to stay confident in myself, if this relationship proceeds. I keep thinking to myself I need to go in a strict diet for a few weeks to make myself feel better about my body when I am around him. Even though logically I know that is a bad idea.

When I open up to someone about this it makes no sense to them. I have a very stereotypically feminine face with small and soft looking features, I dress up in skirts and dresses all the time, I always have my nails and makeup done, etc. My biggest fixation is my hips (I don\u2019t have any). I look in the mirror and feel a weird very strong mix of anger and anxiety when I see my hips because I just don\u2019t think they belong on me. It makes me feel like the way I carry myself so femininely is wrong because I look like a man from the waist down. I have muscular and thick legs from ballet but without hips I feel manly and it\u2019s gross. The thing is, I would consider getting some type of surgery or working out strategically to have round and large hips but then thinking about hips makes me have this whole existential anxiety and I start wishing evolutionary conditions of physical attractiveness literally didn\u2019t exist which stops me from trying to change them. I feel so jealous of girls who have big hips that it makes me mentally tear them down and hate them as people so much that I don\u2019t want to be like them. To worry about hips to this extent sounds silly but I literally zone out countless times throughout the day just having these feelings and mentally obsessing over them.

It's not a very exaggerated difference but it's there. And I felt the need to make this post and contribute to \"apple visibility\"- as happy as I am about progress in body inclusivity in media etc. I rarely find our shape represented. Google searches yield only how to dress for my shape to hide it and implicity be ashamed of it. Even on this subreddit I haven't found many posts about it. So I'm writing this in hopes that someone lurking who's struggling with this will be able to relate and know you're not alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll just say it. Being an apple-shaped woman is HARD. If pants fit in the waist, legs are saggy, especially at the knees. If they fit the legs, they won't close around my waist. I have to wear jegging style jeans to come close to a good fit, and even then the legs bag after a while. Well meaning companies have started to make \"curvy\" style jeans but usually this just means even more butt room and a smaller waist - fitting society's acceptable way to be \"curvy\". Plus-sized models are still hourglass shaped. It's become less acceptable to make fun of fat people, but remains acceptable to make fun of someone's flat butt. Fat on the waist is universally reviled - think ads to \"burn stubborn belly fat\" meanwhile people want to grow their butt. All around me, people are saying that attractiveness means the exact opposite of my body type. The whole big butt trend in the last decade has not helped things at all. I've always liked my breasts, but now it feels like butts are the only thing that matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just keep reminding myself that my worth and beauty isn't defined by what society or anyone finds attractive. And that it's absolutely ridiculous that women's entire bodies are trends, and it's not my responsibility to follow them. Additionally, I'd like to change the narrative, although well-meaning, that \"it's ok to not have a perfect hourglass body\"... who the hell decided hourglass was perfect? My body is perfect the way it is. I love my lean, strong legs, my full bust and cuddly arms. Maybe one day I'll love my round belly. But until then I'm deciding no longer to hate it. What's helping is seeing other women with my shape and deciding to see them as beautiful. It helps me see my own beauty too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't really have a direction I was going with this post. Just to say that APPLE SHAPED LADIES YOU ARE PERFECT THE WAY YOU ARE. YOUR BODY SHAPE IS NOT A FLAW. ALL WAISTS ARE GOOD WAISTS. ALL BOOBS ARE GOOD BOOBS. ALL BUTTS ARE GOOD BUTTS. Thanks for reading. End rant.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

Mostly in the text threads. Specifically, I am seeing a lot of people post about their eating plans and attitudes towards their bodies and weight loss that seem like ACTUAL eating disorders, and people responding like it's a typical lifestyle change. I totally understand that when you are losing weight in a healthy way it is annoying as FUCK to have people in your life constantly tell you that counting calories mean you're anorexic or that you HAVE TO STOP LOSING WEIGHT!!!11!!!1 when you still have plenty to lose, and I think people want so strongly to not do that to others that nobody is really willing to call folks out for maybe going too far. But I really like this place, and I don't want to see it get turned into a place where eating disorders are encouraged to flourish.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing that seems to be going up a lot lately is REALLY intense fasting. I'm not talking about IF, which I think is fine for a lot of people (schedule your daily meals whenever you want), I'm talking about entire days of subsisting off of black coffee and acting like that's totally normal or regularly having 200-800 calorie days. This seems to have started being accepted in this sub as totally healthy behavior.  I'm not sure it's much healthier to regularly eat nothing for an entire day than it is to eat an entire extra large pizza three times a day. This especially worries me when it's combined with people who state clearly they have active problems with bingeing, but always feel better after fasting (\"I can't believe I ate that much, but at least I'm six hours into a new fast and starting to feel clean again!\"). Regular bingeing followed by long fasts \\*is bulimia\\* and we should not be encouraging it. I am also seeing posts from people talking about how they're feeling dizzy or ill because it's \"outside their eating window\" but they have to \"stay strong\". That registers to me as eating disorder talk.  Also, people posting about losing weight into the medically underweight range because \"I like my body better this way\" without any mention of talking to a doctor and making sure it's a healthy weight for them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know there are folks here who will disagree with me.  If you think I am dead wrong please post, I would really like to have an open discussion. I just felt like it needed to be addressed. I am also just wondering on others thoughts for when it is appropriate to suggest to others they may wish to maybe check out an eating disorder screening tool, or speak with a counselor about their weight issues.

I really mean it.\n\nLinda Bacon's *Health at Every Size* (2008) is often described as the beginning of the HAES movement (although these ideas have been around since the 1960s). It's the seminal text that so many fat activists turn to when critiquing diet culture and pressures to be thin. I get books for free thanks to my job, so I decided to read up on Bacon's *HAES* and decide for myself what the main messages were.\n\nReader, I was surprised.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/9hzlnm9wsma31.jpg\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first thing to understand about this book is that it is divided in to two parts. My main focus on this review is the first half of the book, which outlines the HAES philosophy and the evidence behind it. This is where a surprising amount of sanity lurks. The second half is dedicated to tips about eating sensibly and enjoying exercise. I\u2019m happy to answer any questions about it, but it\u2019s more about worksheets than theory. It\u2019s also closer to what you might expect from a HAES handbook, advocating the idea that telling someone to lose weight is as bad as telling them to be whiter or straighter (p 190). The eating suggestions don't involve limiting calories, and the exercise advocated is so mild that it's not going to do much for peoples' cardiovascular fitness. No surprises there. The real gems of sanity (and the parts that FAs seem to have missed) are in the front half of this text.\n\n**Bacon's** ***HAES***\n\nLet's get on to a discussion of what's in the first half of the book and what Bacon is actually trying to achieve.\n\nAs regards the title, Bacon is saying they health can and should be your aim no matter what your size. Basically, being active is very good for your physical and mental wellbeing regardless of how fat or thin you may be. Everyone should endeavour to exercise in a way that is sustainable and habitual (p 54). Healthy lifestyle habits are available to everyone (p 157). I think that's something we can agree with on this sub, especially as many of us are currently over- or underweight.\n\nImportantly, *this book is not for people who find it easy to lose weight.*\n\nIf you are one of the many people on this sub who hasn\u2019t had too much trouble increasing your movement and decreasing your intake, then this book isn\u2019t for you. It\u2019s for those of us who have struggled with CICO and can\u2019t quite understand why. As someone with Binge Eating Disorder, I actually found her approach quite helpful. While I understand CICO, I have trouble adjusting my behaviour accordingly. \n\nOne of Bacon\u2019s main arguments is that we are not perfectly rational beings with full control over our appetites. On one level, we can be hijacked by external cues like food advertising and social pressure about when and what to eat. On another level, our body registers how much we have consumed and how much energy we have spent. This has a powerful impact on our hunger cues. We need very high levels of willpower to ignore these cues to eat more during significant caloric deficit. This is why only a minority of people lose weight and maintain weight loss after a crash diet. \n\nSo, you\u2019re set if you can say no to external cues to eat like enforced meal times or peer pressure. You have a good chance of losing weight if you are deeply motivated to ignore your body\u2019s many hunger signals and keep ignoring them for extended periods of time. That's awesome for you, and Bacon and I are a bit jealous. Don't judge.\n\nIf you can\u2019t honestly commit to weight loss via significantly reduced calories, you need to learn how to balance your approach to eating so that it synchronises with how your body works. The good news is that most of us who are trying to lose weight are eating more than our bodies want us to. I think this mindset is actually quite constructive and helpful for people like me with BED, or others who have problems with their willpower or maintaining a diet in their particular social circumstances.\n\n**Pro-CICO?**\n\nBacon makes some interesting observations that support CICO. Here are some arguments and observations that are in the book. They may surprise you:\n\n* \u201cWeight loss is simply a matter of taking in fewer calories than you spend\u201d. In a perfect world, reducing calorie intake by going on a diet and increasing calorie expenditure through exercise would lead to lasting weight loss. Many people fail to achieve this in a long lasting way because we don\u2019t have total conscious control of our body\u2019s cues, which makes following these regimens hard (pp 44-45).\n* Bacon knows that 2000 calories is ideal for a woman of her age and energy needs. She eats roughly this much each day and maintains her weight as a result. Some people will gain weight on this amount. Others will lose weight. It\u2019s all about their personal energy needs (p 45).\n* A big reason why chronic dieters fail despite frequent extreme calorie restriction is the periods of equally extreme indulgence. The more we take part in crash diets or starvation level diets, the more we mess up the hormonal cues that cause hunger. Our body also sends out signals that we need very high-fat foods and lowers our energy so that we feel too lethargic to burn them off with increased activity (pp 48-49).\n* \u201cMany people believe that exercising gives them permission to eat more than they are actually hungry for\u201d. This means that many people never see a significant change in weight when they increase their calorie output (p 53).\n* Our bodies have complex hungry responses impacted by hormonal responses to stress, sleep, and even the viruses in our bloodstream. Pollution hypothetically impacts our hormonal systems as well. There is no healthy way to change your hormones or immune system via pills or other aids. Even drugs that increase metabolism will stop working effectively as your body compensates. Basically, there's no magic fat burn pill so don't waste your time (pp 54ff)\n* With modern foods, we can eat high calorie snacks that bypass our natural hunger system due to new ingredients like high fructose corn syrup. The volume of food you consume does not have a direct relationship with your size, as you may be consuming small unsatisfying snacks with low fibre that don\u2019t satiate you. A small snack might have as many calories as a full meal, but will still leave you wanting more (p 69). On this note, the US food industry is insidious, corrupt, and distancing consumers from healthy, fresh produce and natural tastes. This messes with our hunger receptors and can make us eat more than we need to (pp 113ff).\n* Fat around your abdomen is particularly unhealthy. Heavier people are more likely to have insulin resistance, and develop Type II Diabetes as a result. Insulin helps to decrease our appetite, but this goes haywire when we get insulin spikes from too many refined grains (p 77). (FYI: she does explain that fibre can control the sugar hit. So if you crave apple juice, try to satisfy it by eating an actual apple instead). \n* Try not to label food as good or bad. Yep, we certainly see this argument in fatlogic world! But the reality of this statement isn\u2019t so bad. Bacon suggests we allow ourselves any kind of food in moderation without punishing ourselves for being bad or rewarding ourselves with a naughty treat. Instead, we should pay attention to how a \u2018bad\u2019 food like a Twinkie feels. Respect your body\u2019s response to the sugar and the taste. Tap in to these signals with an open-mind to see how and when a sugary snack might be good for you. You will probably find that you rarely want or need it if you base your desires on your body\u2019s behaviour during and after the 'bad' food (p 94).\n\n**The Notorious Set Point Theory**\n\nOne of the ideas from Bacon that seems to permeate the fatlogic world is the idea of a set point: a natural weight that our body seeks to stabilise at. We\u2019ve all heard people claiming that their set point is 250 pounds and no amount of dieting will change this.\n\nSo what does Bacon actually say?\n\nShe does argue for a set point, but notes that many people are *above* their set point of ideal weight because they are bad at recognising when they are hungry, go through binge/starve cycles, or over-eat for emotional reasons (p 28). So, if you want to use Bacon\u2019s argument about set points, you need to keep in mind that fact that *many people are below or above their set point due to bad eating choices*. \n\nA person who spends all day stuffing their face to address their emotions (lol, like me) cannot be at their set point. Only a healthy eater who pays proper attention to their body\u2019s signals can be at their natural set point. In modern America, such people are a minority. \n\nMy interpretation of a set point, in light of this book, is that we all have different physiques. For example, you might have two ladies who are 5\u20196. One has delicate bone structure, narrow hips, and a flat chest. Realistically, her body will settle on a lower natural weight than a 5\u20196 lady with a wide pelvis and a big bust size. Or, you might have two men who are 5\u20199. One has broad shoulders and stocky legs. The other is slim with a narrow physique. You wouldn\u2019t expect these people to have the same BMI. The naturally larger ones will need to eat a little more to sustain their higher natural set point. Their bodies will give them hormonal signals to help them achieve an appropriate intake specific to their own body. \n\nNow, we are talking a difference here of a few kilos and a few hundred calories. The healthy range on a BMI chart isn\u2019t just a single weight, after all. There\u2019s nothing in Bacon\u2019s text that actually condones the idea that 300 pounds is anyone\u2019s set point. Instead, she makes the fairly reasonable claim that all bodies are different with different dietary needs. \n\nIt\u2019s also clear that people like me who binge are probably quite a bit above our set point, as Bacon herself was before she put HAES in to action. Bacon actually lost 30 pounds following the HAES model. She also stopped her yo-yo dieting and learned how to relax around food and find a stable intake that worked for her (p xxii). She describes her set point as this *lower weight* that she obtained once she got in tune with her body\u2019s signals. \n\n**Some Critiques**\n\nNot everything about the first half of this book is flawless.\n\nThere are areas where I disagree with Bacon. She believes that bariatric surgeons routinely exaggerate the danger of obesity in order to sell very dangerous procedures (pp 62ff). I think obesity is life threatening, and I don\u2019t feel bothered by people who need a surgical solution to it (so long as they\u2019re well informed about the permanent lifestyle changes needed to make it work). \n\nEven more problematic is her occasional promotion of studies that \u2018prove\u2019 fat and thin people eat the same amount (p 68). Are we talking about the same volume, but thinner people eating fewer calories? Were the studies undertaken in a closed environment that didn\u2019t rely on self-reporting of intake? It\u2019s not clear. These studies can be very problematic, and I don't think they are used well.\n\nThere are also moments were she doesn\u2019t seem to believe in CICO anymore (pp 70, 143)!\n\nThe chapter titled \u2018We\u2019re Victims of Fat Politics\u2019 has some questionable statements. Bacon disagrees with the idea that overweight people are unhealthy or that obesity shortens our life spans. She argues that the data used in these studies is flawed. I think this chapter is really off, so I haven\u2019t included it in my positive observations above. I\u2019m also not the right kind of doctor to really comment on cardiovascular or metabolic studies. Maybe someone else here can jump in. \n\n**Conclusions**\n\nI certainly don't agree with Bacon in on every claim she makes. It\u2019s a book with multiple arguments based on interpretations of different scientific studies and clinical observations. The only books I stand by in full are the two I wrote. (Even then there\u2019s room for argument...). \n\nBut, I think it's important that we get a sense of where fat logic is coming from and how it has developed as an argument if we wish to combat this kind of thinking in our selves and our communities. You don't get anywhere by ignoring the people you disagree with.\n\nI'm very happy to have read *HAES*, and there are some real gems of advice that I will be taking on board. It also showed me that Bacon appeals due to her compassion for her readers. She's an empathetic person who challenges the view that everyone who is fat is an ignorant failure. Maybe that's something we need to consider more.\n\nIf anyone has recommendations for other books you'd like me to read and report back on, I'm happy to do so. I hope you enjoyed this review, and I'd love to hear your thoughts.\n\n^((Page numbers correspond to the BenBella 2010 edition.))", "subreddit": "fatlogic"}

I don\u2019t even have an appetite for dinner now because I\u2019m so disgusted with my feelings.  I KNOW I\u2019m not a big girl.  I should be thankful for what I have but I instead hide my body because of all its flaws. I have no kids but at 27 in the next few years it\u2019s something I will want and I don\u2019t want to fuck up my future kids with body issues like my mom did to me and my siblings.

I come from very strong religion-based values and in my house, it was always better to please God than to look good or to be \"hip\u201d to be honest if that is still an expression these days.  I distinctly remember negative comments about my weight when I was young and at that moment I associated my body as something bad and shameful.  My teen years weren't a cake either being as chubby as I am, middle school was terrible I was constantly bullied for my weight, mannerisms, and manboobs.  Thank heavens for my friends if it weren't for them I would've done much worse or even some crazy stuff. As a boy,  people expect you to be confident.  To be this force of nature that can handle a conversation or even brag about stuff.  That was not me,  I completely hid in books and animation.  All-day looking at cartoons about superheroes because the world of fantasy was always better than to live in a world where you don't feel accepted or even remotely validated.    \nHigh school came and bullying was apparent and very real in my life but there was something different I learned how to make people laugh and that helped get more socially savvy and it gave me lots of good friends and people that to this day we are close in some way shape or form.   People came just to see me crack jokes and have a good time and they were in for a treat.  That moment gave me lots of confidence in myself,  for the first time people weren't making fun of me they were laughing with me. Some witty observation or an absurd comment with a twist.  Glimpses of low self-esteem hit me when no one was around but I still felt that things would get better at some point.   \nThe puberty years were gone and now a totally different dimension opened for me at college which was great because I was finally watching different points of views in topics and society was changing its views on so many levels that I truly had hope and to make it more awesome that were I met one of my dearest friends who was a plus-sized model and through conversation and a lot of patience she made me feel like I was on top.  The best lesson that she gave me was self-confidence.  She pushed me to love myself in a way I never saw myself and not only she was an angel in that way she inspired me to be a better person by showing me that I was talented and that I was enough.  After college, I still struggle in some shape or form with my confidence some days I'm on top and some days I truly feel like garbage but even at those moments I still find ways to validate myself and love myself.  Something that will always stick in my mind is these two phrases:  \"You should always see yourself in the eyes of those who love you.\u201d and \u201cAll you have is your body and hating it constantly will only waste your time.   Looking back,  I wish I took more photos, made more memories or connected with more people.  I wish I took my shirt off (I still don't) and loved my essence completely and reflect that self-love I feel inside on the outside.  In the end, things will get better, love finds you.  You start to see yourself as a complete person and not someone that has to try a new diet every week or someone who buys baggier clothes so your body rolls do not show.   You hate yourself less and start to see the good sides of your body because confidence and sexy does not necessarily need to have the perfect body also it isn\u2019t tied to abs of a chiseled jaw.  Sometimes sexy can be a thick body, a nice belly or a smile that can light up a room that's why I constantly decide to love myself and not to listen to my negative thoughts.  Whenever you are in life or whatever your clothes sizes are always looking at the mirror-like you are deserving of love, respect, and acceptance.

What I\u2019d like to do is outline (and debunk) three misconceptions about thermodynamics that are persistently thrown around in the fat-o-sphere and other places online.\n\n***Thermodynamics applies only to \u201csimple\u201d systems, not ones as complex as the human body***\n\nThis particular misconception is particularly pervasive. It\u2019s not difficult to see why: physics is often thought as a discipline where abstraction is prized over concreteness (you may have heard of the joke about spherical cows in a vacuum). Thermodynamics, however, is unique amongst the branches of physics in that it\u2019s not so much a theory as a manual for theories. By this I mean that in thermodynamics, we really don\u2019t care about the internal workings of the systems we study (that\u2019s generally the job of statistical mechanics). In thermodynamics, you adopt a \u201cblack box\u201d approach:  no matter what goes on inside your incredibly complex system (be it the human body, a diesel engine, or even the Earth itself), thermodynamics is essentially a series of consistency checks against which you can check your theory. Your system can be as complicated as you want, but if your description of it doesn\u2019t obey the laws of thermodynamics, something has gone terribly wrong.\n\n***The first law of thermodynamics applies only to closed systems, so it can\u2019t apply to the human body***\n\nThis is flat-out wrong: the first law of thermodynamics applies to every system. In fact, the first law of thermodynamics is one of those consistency checks that I mentioned above:  in simple terms it tells you that you can\u2019t conjure energy out of thin air. It\u2019s an incredibly simple equation:\n\n&gt;dU = dQ - dW\n\n\u201cThe chance in internal energy of a system (dU) is equal to the energy you put in (dQ) minus the work the system performs (dW)\u201d. Simple as that. Closed systems are ones which don\u2019t interact with the environment (i.e. you never put energy into them, so dQ = 0), but the first law applies to all systems, no matter how complicated they are. The human body is absolutely fair game.\n\nWe all know that the change in your bank account over, say, a year is equal to the money you deposited minus the money you withdrew. Saying that the first law of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems is like saying that simple accountancy only applies if you never get paid! It makes no sense, and it shows a complete misunderstanding of what the first law of thermodynamics is.\n\nAs a side note, the second law of thermodynamics does only apply to closed systems, but discussing it is far too involved for me to do here. Let me just say that it really doesn\u2019t have much to do with what you\u2019re eating.\n\n***A calorie is not a calorie***\n\nThis isn\u2019t a single misconception, but rather a collection of serious misunderstandings about what the term \u201ccalorie\u201d actually means. Many times you hear fat proponents say things like:\n\n\u201cA calorie is just the amount of energy needed to heat a gram of water by one degree Celsius, and this has nothing to do with weight and the human body.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s lay down some terms: a calorie is a unit of energy. \u201cEnergy\u201d is a very difficult term to define, but for our purposes it suffices to view it as the capacity of a system to do work. Now, it\u2019s true that a calorie is defined as in the quote above, but that doesn\u2019t at all mean that \u201ccalories\u201d are special in any sort of way. You can measure energy using joules, electron-volts, or foot pound-forces if you want: the laws of nature are completely indifferent to the units you choose to express them in, and as it so happens, the first law of thermodynamics is one of them. Even saying \u201ccaloric intake\u201d is ever so slightly misleading: it\u2019s like calling your weight your \u201cpoundage\u201d (or electric potential difference \u201cvoltage\u201d). It\u2019s just your energy intake: you chose to use calories to measure it. \n\nImagine someone saying \u201cA meter is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second. What does that have to do with my height?\u201d That\u2019s exactly how silly it sounds to say that because the definition of a calorie uses water, it doesn\u2019t apply to the human body. It\u2019s just a standard we have chosen to use, and there are many, many other standards. If you want to use cupcakes to measure how much food energy you consume, be my guest, just be sure to use a standardized cupcake. \n\nOther common sayings are \u201chuman bodies process calories differently\u201d, or \u201ca calorie is not always a calorie\u201d. At the risk of being pedantic, this should read \u201chuman bodies process energy differently\u201d, but how true is that? It is certainly true that human bodies can process food differently, but energy? The answer is no. Once again, it doesn\u2019t matter what goes on inside your body: you will never be able to generate energy out of thin air (\u201cI eat nothing and I still put on the pounds\u201d), or make energy vanish (\u201cI eat like a pig and never gain weight\u201d), unless somehow the food you're eating isn't actually giving your body any energy (and even then, the energy isn't vanishing, it's just passing through you). Lizzie Vel\u00e1squez, for example, eats upwards of 5000kcal/day but is emaciated, since her body doesn't absorb most of it. You may even have a tapeworm that steals some of your precious dietary energy. However, if you look at the energy your body *actually takes in* (and in the vast majority of cases, all of the food you eat contributes towards it), you can never go wrong. Instead of saying \u201ca calorie isn\u2019t always a calorie\u201d, we should probably say \u201ca calorie on the nutritional information isn\u2019t always a calorie your body absorbs\u201d, although that\u2019s less pithy (and still misleading, because for the vast majority of people, nutritional information is perfectly accurate).\n\n**ADDENDUM:** This is a note about different metabolic rates in humans, and another justification for \"a calorie is not a calorie\". Though the frequency and magnitude of this effect is often overstated, it is absolutely possible that there is a difference between people of the same build and same activity level in how much energy their bodies spend each day (colloquially, their metabolism). The reason could be a fever (which raises it), hypothyroidism (which lowers it), amputation (whoch *severely* lowers it), or just a natural variance in the metabolic rate. You can never *fully* trust BMR and TDEE calculators, but more often than not, they give you a really good estimate of your caloric needs. Still, these inaccuracies *can* be taken into account: it may require some trial and error by carefully monitoring what you eat and your activity levels, but you will find that the predicted levels of your metabolic rate will very, very rarely vary beyond about 200kcal/day. Nonetheless, at the end of the day, all these complications eventually boil down to a modification of the equation above: if something is causing you not to absorb all the energy in your food that you're eating, dU is a bit lower than it says on your nutritional info, and if your body requires more or less energy than average, dW has to change slightly. The first law of thermodynamics still works: a calorie is still a calorie, much like a pound is still a pound even if your recipe mistakenly calls for less flour than you actually need. The take-home message is just that when *applying* this nifty law, you have to be very aware of how much energy your body is *actually* spending each day, which may just vary a bit from the average.\n\n\nThermodynamics, by design almost, deals in \u201cbroad strokes\u201d. It doesn\u2019t say much about the human body, or any other system really. If anything, it says the least: it tells you the absolute minimum of information that is true about a system without knowing anything about its inner workings, and one thing that will never, ever stop being true is that energy is always conserved; or, if you prefer, there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch.", "subreddit": "fatlogic"}

The veins in my forehead are always visible. Starting above my nose, 2 veins split up in a v that go to my hairline. I can feel indentations in my skull where they are. They are either dark blue if I'm not doing anything, more visible in the shade, or if I'm laughing or something just bulging but as soon as I stop they go back to dark blue lines\n\nI remember thinking about them as a kid, I'm pretty sure they have been at least somewhat visible my whole life, but in the last 8-9 months I have become so self conscious about it. I think I look grotesque. \n\nI've looked around online and I can't even find people talking about having the same thing, pictures of people who have it the same way, or anything to do about it. You've probably seen people with little blue veins on the side of the head by the temples. That is what it looks like for me, but instead 2 massive lines on my forehead.\n\n About 2.5 months ago when I moved back home for the summer from college, I went to the doctor and he suggested a type of plastic surgery that would kill the vein, but I don't think it would do anything because I have actual indentations in my skull, so the indentations would still be there. When I told him that, he suggested antidepressants and therapy. At the time, I was super depressed, but I feel like I have gotten a handle on that by myself. While my depression was directly caused by hating the way that I look, I got a haircut with bangs that covered my forehead and worked as hard as I could to not hate myself and focus on my good qualities. I'm planning on going to therapy when I move back to start school again.\n\nI had long hair for the last few years that I really liked, and I always got a lot of compliments on it. I wasn't worried about how my forehead looked at all. I'm not sure if my appearance or mentality changed. For the last 8-9 months I just wore a beanie or bandana every day to cover up my forehead. Any time I would take them off, I would be hyper self conscious. I went to my friends for help, and they all just said \"don't worry about it, you are who you are\" sort of thing. One day, I went into the food court without a hat on after I decided that they weren't too bad that day. Pretty much as soon as I walk inside, this guy I kinda know says, \"you know you have veins on your forehead right? That's really handsome, really attractive.\" I just said, \"thanks appreciate it.\" \n\nBefore I got a haircut, I thought my hair looked nice and complimented my face. Now with my current haircut i just look like a goofball, but my forehead is covered.\n\nI don't know what to do. I think I would be an attractive guy if I had a decent haircut and my forehead didn't look f**ked up. I think it just looks so weird. I think it's off-putting. Any suggestions?

Figured she was sick, left a note, and didn\u2019t bring it up. 3 days later, I pass by her bathroom again, hearing the same exact thing.\n\nWould\u2019ve asked her if she was sick the first time but had too much on my mind due to work. I would\u2019ve asked her 3 days later until she walked out and I noticed her knuckles were visibly red. It looks as she had scraped them badly.\n\nFirst thought that came to my head; self induced vomiting. Now, I know my daughter, if I bring this up to her right away, she will FLIP. I wanted to make sure I could really help her.\n\nNext night, I offered to take her out for dinner (told her I got a promotion at work.) She refused. I asked her why and she said she wasn\u2019t hungry. I told her I could pick something up for her and she could save it for tomorrow. Told me she wasn\u2019t in the mood.\n\nNow in my head, I figure she has some sort of eating disorder. I\u2019ve connected the facts and I\u2019m assuming it must be bulimia or some sort. I\u2019m not home very much anymore. Her father isn\u2019t around so I\u2019m mostly working.\n\nI love her to death. I wanna help her. I would\u2019ve brought it up to her long ago but when she gets mad, she flips out and threatens to move into a dorm after the summer.\n\nIt\u2019s just me and her. I don\u2019t know what to do. I want to talk to her but I want to make sure whatever I\u2019m doing is effective. I\u2019m very close with her.

I heard the same vomiting today, came out with red knuckles and red cheeks. I don\u2019t know if she knows I notice. She has a pale complexion so red on her is noticeable.\n\nSomeone please help me with this.\n\nEDIT: 2nd time around; I assumed if she was self inducing vomit, there was a reason. When I was in my 20\u2019s, I had a horrible stomach virus I didn\u2019t know about. I only felt nauseous and wasn\u2019t able to vomit, so I did it on my own. Haven\u2019t gotten sick like that since, so the details didn\u2019t cross my mind.\n\nShe\u2019s fairly skinny. Not overweight at all so I never thought she\u2019d have a problem with body image. I don\u2019t wanna sound like those oblivious moms.

This time the pain had taken over my entire lower back and hip. I couldn\u2019t walk. I, who avoids doctors because I always think it will just \u201cgo away\u201d,  couldn\u2019t take it and went to the only place that would take me. After x - rays were taken, I was diagnosed with lower back c-shape scoliosis. \n\nNow, I could go into more details, but overall at first I had a sense of relief knowing that the back pain I did carry was not in my head. My running always falling short because of my feet going numb, the days I hobbled around as a 20 year old struggling to get up, all the school pictures with an awkward head tilt. It wasn\u2019t in my head. But now at day three of pain, it\u2019s the first day I finally can stand straight up again. I still have pain but at least I feel that I will soon be able to get back to my lifestyle.\n\nThe issue now is that I think about it all the time. I feel I am in 7th grade trying to relearn my body. How has this limited me already? How will it in the future? How many days of severe back pain do I have? How did everyone miss this while I was growing up getting scoliosis tests in school? Is it obvious? Can people see my deformed back? I keep reaching back and trying to feel up my spine. How could I not have known this?!\n\nI struggled so long to be comfortable with myself. Ive always been over average weight, more pudgy because of my short height really. Had acne since 4th grade. Was one of the first kids in my grade to hit puberty. Made fun of most of my years in elementary school. It took me so long to love myself. Three days ago I was a bad ass independent, rock climbing, muscular woman who finally has accepted most of my \u201cflaws.\u201d Yesterday, I was a crying, embarrassed, frustrated, little girl who had to ask her boyfriend to carry her bag because she couldn\u2019t get out of the car and walk down the hallway without help.\n\nI know my muscles will loosen up soon and I will be right back at it, but I want to feel like I know myself again. I don\u2019t want to worry about what the future holds. I am trying to find a doctor currently, and will be proactive. This won\u2019t define my life, especially since it hasn\u2019t the last 28 years. I am thankful for a body that somehow over compensated and I do not live in chronic pain. I don\u2019t want to sit and complain. I just feel lost, ugly, and broken all again. It will pass, but I think I just needed to write it out. Thank you for reading.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

The yacht party was canceled because the yacht was crashed and I left before bathing suits came out with a water balloon fight. \n\nI take meds for depression and it\u2019s made me lose weight but even then I still feel so uncomfortable in my skin. \n\nLike no matter how I look, I will still feel this way and it makes me feel stuck, I have no clue how to accept this, or how to work out of this.

I'm a 21M, and am currently in a complicated situation. I would consider my sister (who is close to my age) to be a best friend of mine. We text each other all the time and she has always been there for me in the toughest of situations. We both attend colleges in different parts of the US. Recently I've wanted to see her in person, and while we still totally get along very well by text, she doesn't feel comfortable seeing me right now because of my body. She explicitly told me this, I didn't infer it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome context. Back in high school, I used to be a bit overweight, but it didn't effect might health negatively. This is kind of normal in my family, I never felt uncomfortable about my weight growing up. During high school, my sister had an eating disorder that I wasn't made aware of until relatively recently. She later told me that it was in part due to insecurities she had in high school, and to an extent she did it because she felt behind to me academically and socially. I understand why she felt that way because my high school could sometimes have an unforgiving social dynamic and I acknowledged I could have been a better support for her. We were never against each other in high school at all, but there was that hidden tension that I didn't know existed until I went to college.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce we started college, I think being a new environment really helped my sister a lot. She grew a lot academically and became very involved in a lot of activities.  When I went to college, I felt slightly insecure about my weight and got involved in some different athletic activities, so as a result I lost a noticeable amount of weight. When we'd visit for holidays, my sister would be very upset about my weight / eating habits; kind of micro-analyzing everything I did and would often leave the room during meals because it stressed her out. I don't make any comments about the way I eat or exercise, but just being physically around my sister upsets her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm at this point where I'm not really sure what to do. I imagine she needs time and distance to feel better about herself and her relationship with me, so I won't be visiting her this summer because I don't want to force her into an uncomfortable position. However, I would like to see if there are any conversations I could have with her to make her feel better about this situation. I've already told her that I'm taking care of myself and that I always love her no matter what her body is like. I also avoid talking about anything related to health, body image and diet with the exception of mental health because I have gone through some weird stuff lately (that's a whole other story). Anyways, I want to do what is best for my sister and I think the best thing right now is to give her space, but I'd like some advice for anyone who has been in this situation before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if this is the right place to post this, so let me know if there are other subreddits better suited for this.

I already feel better about how I look from not being exposed to that, but Im bitter that I cant be online as freely as some skinny white dude (I am female and also on some other marginalized axises) \n\nbut scrolling for random stuff can be compelling and today I glanced at the Reddit popular page.\n\nA top post from murderedbywords was about how every fat person can lose weight. \n\nThis is not true. Not exactly. Not if you add \u201clong term\u201d, or \u201csafely\u201d, not if you consider disability, pregnancy, illness. Not if what you mean is that we can all become skinny. \n\nBut also - man f that. Sure, I can and have lost weight. BUT I DONT OWE THAT TO YOU. Just because we can focus all our energy on becoming thin doesnt mean we should or have to. It doesnt justify the hate. \n\nAlso, an admin rejected reports of concern by saying he is fat, and Im so fuckin tired of self-hating fat people who cant see we are all different and want to drag us down in self hate. Studies show that self hate makes it harder to lose weight anyway!\n\nWe deserve to move in peace through the world like anyone else!  No one is entitled to mock us!\n\nAlso on reddit I saw a post wherein fat women *dancing* were mocked \u201cbc hEaLth!1!?!\u201d Because the way to encourage health is to mock us when we exercise? Like the guys who yell at us when we bike, the folks who post pics mocking us swimming or at the gym.  We dont owe the world invisibility!\n\nIn fact, my own fatphobic family mocks me for my obsession with healthy food! They try to pressure me to eat crap when I say no, the same people who convinced me to stop eating bread, blaming it for my diabetes. Later, hospitalized for anorexia, two teams of nutritionists worked overtime to deprogram me saying I am skipping important foods with my focus on \u201cjunk\u201d like bread.  My mom even tried to discourage me exercising. Im convinced some people just want us to stay fat to mock us.\n\nAfter one doctor fat shamed me after a weight loss the nurses said was too much too fast due to starving myself, I stopped being able to go to doctors for a while. My new doctor hates that shit and discourages me from focusing on weight loss. \n\nPeople say \u201cit\u2019s my business (to bully) bc your health care costs money.\u201d but yet you claim you bully due to health. If I was gonna lose weight I would have to do so under the care of a doctor! I DESERVE HEALTH CARE. No one is saying smokers shouldnt be allowed in public without mockery or allowed health care.  \n\nIt shouldnt matter why Im fat or whether I try to lose weight. I have a right to equal human dignity. I am not on this earth to be a punching bag. I dont owe the world misery, invisibility, or to destroy myself in pursuit of thinness. My life is about so much more than that and my energies belong elsewhere.\n\nI hope this was more helpful than depressing to read, I hope it is appropriate to post.

My legs, belly, back, face, and hands have been spared from the marks, but I really really dislike them and it made me self conscious, my mom doesn\u2019t have anything like this (she had very few marks) my sisters don\u2019t really have anything like it (so far I know) and my \u201cdad\u201d, yeah I don\u2019t know. \n\n\n\nOkay, thank you for reading this odd self conscious perception of my body.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I have had problems with body image my whole adult life, especially with how fat is distributed in my body. I am not overweight; all I eat just goes straight to my tummy area and I am self conscious about it. Soooo Today my co-worker approached me and started to congratulate me for being pregnant. I felt mortified and just shook my head, I did not know what to do. She got really embrassed and apologized multiple times. I know she didn't mean to be rude but I just felt so horrible the whole day and I still can't stop thinking about it. I can't shake the feeling that I have to start losing weight.

This seemed like an appropriate place to do so. Please, excuse me if I'm mistaken.\n\nI've reacquainted myself with a close childhood friend from 20 years ago, and our renewed relationship is romantic. We are both single parents, with me having two children out of wedlock, and her being divorced with three. At approximately 30 years old for the both of us, we still retain slim and supple builds, but there is a clear difference in our body types.\n\nBeing male, I was never directly affected by the physical toll of carrying children; she, on the other hand, obviously has. Through adulthood, I've maintained a balanced diet, and a strong exercise regimen, with a focus on attaining an ideal form for my own body, best depicted by mainstream male standards. She also eats decently, but doesn't exercise at nearly the same frequency or intensity as I. Of course, the process of multiple pregnancies does much to the female body also.\n\nMy conceptions of beauty for the female form, particularly, those features that arouse most, are confined by my heightened interest in nubile characteristics, and flawlessness, if such a condition exists for the human body. I saw her body, in its entirety, this weekend, as did she see mine. Her body did not match these ideal forms that I've accepted in my mind and imagination.\n\nHer body presented the evidence of bearing three children, in the multitude of ways you would expect it to. The definition of her muscular anatomy gave testimony to her time spent with her children, and not the gym. Scarring from  surgery due to a medical necessity was plainly visible in an area that is otherwise appreciated for its unadulterated form. Bruising acquired during hiccups of rough and tumble children's play presented themselves here and there.\n\nShe presented herself to me, and I love every inch I encountered. I knew every apparent imperfection, was only a perfection of her motherly form. Her reservations in exposing herself, was contrasted with the confidence in which I revealed mine. Yet, it seems to me that a lack of confidence is what drives me to meet physical standards, whereas a deep confidence in her parental commitment gives her the freedom to offer herself, both in body and mind, to what matters most to her. She's beautiful, and I'm so pleased to acknowledge and experience a beauty that I had previously undervalued.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I'm the same as I've been the past few months as I've started to love and embrace myself. Has anyone else dealt with this? Does what others say whether it be negative OR positve affect how you percieve yourself even if it was originally what you were aiming for?

I'm sure it adds to my anxieties, but the biggest thing pushing me is not the photoshopped people, but the people around me. My family constantly points out if someone gained weight, and my parents have been recently on the \"be fit and healthy\" train, which they don't mean for me to be affected by. My friends are skinny and complain about their weight, which makes me sink in more and more to my negative thoughts. My best friend who is skinnier than me tried her hardest to convince me that her legs are \"bigger than mine\" which she knows is not true, and makes me think she is just pitying me. \n\nSo the question is, how do I stop comparing myself? because I think other people with different body shapes are fine, yet I have a constant fear of being seen as the person who gained a bit of weight, or my friends pity-complimenting me.
