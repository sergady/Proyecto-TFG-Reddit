I honestly felt that no one was going to love me because of the way that I look and i actually believed it. I suppose to a point I still do believe it. I've done everything i can to change my appearance to be more pleasing for others. I went and got all my teeth fixed so that they are \"perfect\" now, I began spending an insane amount of time in the gym and would eat so much that i would be sick. I gained weight, got in shape, had a good smile, and here's the kicker...\n\n  It didnt change a thing about how i felt about myself.  This is truly an inside job. Its something that i struggle with on a daily basis. Changing our cognitive habits is more difficult than I could've imagined.  But I know that true acceptance comes from within as corny as it sounds. Theres nothing wrong with exercise and healthy living but dont do it to appease some sick standard that society has set. So for anyone struggling with BDD as I do I encourage you to not give up on yourself, and most importantly work on yourself from the inside out. \n\nTDLR: my main focus for this post was to share my experience with BDD from a skinny Male perspective.

After being OSFED for a few years and going to a psychologist supposedly specialised in EDs, who basically made me understand that at 19 of bmi i was too fat to have an ED, I obviously ended up falling into the spiral of anorexia nervosa. I reached 12 of bmi, almost died, it made me drop out and lose my friends, my boyfriend at the time and everything, but after lot of therapy, antidepressants, and seeing nutritionists and psychiatrists all the time I somehow got over that ED. I started eating. Well, I started binge eating. The first three months I gained 20lbs a month. Then 10lbs a month. Then I managed to slow down and now I maintain and eat normally I guess, so I'm already happy about that achievement.\n\nBut now not even one year after the end of my anorexia I stand in the obese category. And it hurts so much. Doctors keep telling me to lose weight and give me their so called diet advice (which I know sucks because I have so much more knowledge on the subject). My mom fat shames me every time she sees me, thanksfully I moved from home so she only does during the holidays but it hurts so much. Everyone and their son tells me how they are \"worried\" about my \"health\". No one was ever woried about my health when I was at an healthy weight but couldn't sleep at night and spent all my time counting calories. Obviously they just think being fat is bad. Which I don't think is overall. I follow lots of body positivity instagram accounts and there are so many fat girls I think look awesome but I still can't seem to accept myself and everytime I think I made an achievement in that regard someone has to come criticise my weight.\nI don't want to diet ever again because I know that if I start I'm just gonna go back to disordered eating forever, and I don't understand how doctors specifically told I have an history of eating disorders and severe anorexia can even be allowed to suggest dieting to me.\nWay too often, I'm seeing my mind consider I should either die or lose 65lbs.\n\nI know I'm not the only one in that case and plenty of recovered anorexics end up obese but how the hell do I cope with that. I'm already so stressed about my studies and so many other things and wanting to cry when I see myself in the mirror doesn't help. I know my body image is still way better than when I was anorexic but it still is really painful.\n\nI just made an account to post that because so many people know my normal username and I don't feel comfortable with them seeing that.\nI've read the rules and I don't think I broke them but if I did or if that kind of post is not allowed please let me know.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

It comes down to me having (had) an ED, my body not responding to food as it should (gaining weight when eating less than average) and not being believed by a lot of professionals, despite proving them during therapy that it really is the way my body reacts (they monitored my food intake and saw the scale). Its been hard to stand by my story and I have lost a lot of confidence while still having issues with how I see my body.\n\nThe story:\n\nI have had an eating disorder since I was 9 years old (currently 21). I have started treatment a year ago, which ended a month ago or so. During the years when I suffered the most from ED I starved myself to the point there were days I didnt eat at all, never bingeeating to compensate, just if anyones wondering.\n\nThing is: i have never been underweight like most people with my lifestyle would. When I started treatment and explained the way I lived for so long, my therapist did not believe me when I said that I ate like that and never really lost weight. I actually gained 30 kilos (66? pounds?) at my worst.  I know that should technically not be possible and some dieticians I spoke to when I was trying to lose weight told me that it could be hormonal issues or \u201cstarvation mode\u201d, which people now think is a myth. When my therapist didnt believe me I felt not taken serious, as if I had just convinced myself that I ate too little, while I did not like my body, just to avoid real dieting. I KNOW what I ate during those years, because that was my entire problem, being obsessively about restricting food intake for more than 10 years. Anyway, I tried to move past my therapists view, and really tried to focus on getting better and getting a better relation with food, so i was no longer terrified of it.\n\nTherapy has ended and I am now able to eat a little more normal and I am really trying to make progress with starting to love my body more. It stopped because I was doing considerably better, but Im still not there yet.\nWhat I now struggle with is that I am now gaining even more weight when eating more (still not even \u201cnormal people level\u201d and Yes, i eat healthy and exercise). I get anxious because I am so afraid of still putting on more, and I dont know why that happens and what I can do to stop it (my doctor just says Its probably just stress or something and that I should wait it out, but Its really hard to just do nothing when it in itself produces a lot of stress)\nIt gets in the way of my focus of improving acceptance to my body and to love my body more. \n\nI would like to know how I can try to look past my gaining weight and what I can do to care a little less about people (professionals) not believing i have (had) an ED where I starved myself. It has just been so awful having to explain myself over and over and not been believed when I was so fragile. I have moments where I fall back in my old eating pattern, because I hope that this time I will actually really lose weight (instead of gaining like in my last ED episodes)\n\nI dont want that, I just want to start loving my body no matter what diet and what people assume. I would love to hear how you think I could try to start getting a little confidence back.\n\nI know my story sounds fake, that there will be people reading this thinking I made it up to convince my overweight body that Its not really my fault that I am gaining weight etc. \nIts not what Im asking: you dont have to understand, because i dont either. I just want to know what I can do under these circumstances that can make me love my body more. I need support, not critics\n", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}
