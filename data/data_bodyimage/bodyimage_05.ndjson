I had some weight to lose, but not a lot and I also had a lot of muscle. I was happy with my body. Then, I had to get my wisdom teeth removed. Not a big deal. I had never had surgery before, but I wasn't even worried about it, because of how routine the procedure is. I am stubborn and went to work the day after my wisdom teeth removal, which led to me developing dry sockets. I was so sick and in so much pain that I lost 20 lbs in a week and a half. I started to recover from that when toward the end of February the rapid weight loss caught up with me, and my gallbladder became inflamed, infected and full of stones. I ended up losing 25 lbs overall, which was 15% of my body weight. It happened so fast, and while it was happening I was just trying to stay alive, and keep up with my job and graduate school. (When I came back to work after my gallbladder removal my manager even commented \"look at your new skinny body\") Now, months later, the weight is still off. I am smaller now than I have ever been. I hardly recognize myself. I constantly look at my body and all the parts that are much smaller and different now.  People keep commenting on how good I look, and how they've noticed my weight loss. It's a compliment, but it feels like a 'congrats on almost dying.' When I tell people about how I lost the weight, they comment 'maybe I should get my gallbladder removed.\" It's like they see it as a good thing, but it wasn't a good thing. If I had lost the weight slowly, and in a healthy way I would be celebrating. It's just been a tough year so far, and sometimes I forget everything that happened, until I look in a mirror, or get dressed. I don't know why this is so hard for me, but I have been struggling so much lately. Thanks for reading, I really just needed to vent.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

Apparently, this day is also some so-called \"International No Diet Day\", which many of those HAES/FA cultists venerate, and go all out to avoid \"being on a diet\" on this day. Though, then again, \"avoiding diets\" is an everyday occurrence for them, but this day is symbolically more important to them, so... o.o\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyway, using an idea that I came across on this sub years ago, for the past few years, every time 6 May comes around, I have decided to join in the festivities, by going on a 24-hour fast on this day every year! I too, am going \"no diet\" on this day as well! This, as the word \"diet\" refers to the foodstuff one consumes in their daily lives, hence, wouldn't \"no diet\" equals to no food consumed at all? &gt;:D\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHad been \"promoting\" this for the past few weeks on and off on this sub, but, if anyone wants to, feel free to join me on this fast, from 0000 Hrs on 6 May, until 0000 Hrs on 7 May, based off your local timezone? Please take note of the important caveats listed below if you intend to join before \"checking-in\" in this thread, and I wish you all the best in your 24-hour fast today. :)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nImportant caveats:\n\n* THIS EVENT IS COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY.\n\n* DO NOT JOIN THIS EVENT IF YOU EVER HAD A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OF ANY EATING DISORDER. Instead, please use this day to focus on your recovery. Take care!\n\n* IF YOU ARE NOT FEELING WELL, PLEASE DO NOT JOIN AS WELL. There is a risk of aggravating any current illness you might have, which is a risk I will rather avoid. Please rest well!\n\n* \"Starvation mode\" does not exist, at least, in the manner that those HAES/FA cultists put it. \"Dehydration mode\" however, does exist, and is potentially lethal! Please ensure adequate water consumption, but don't go overboard and end up with \"electrolyte imbalance mode\", which could be lethal as well...\n\n* If you are not feeling well during the course of the 24-hour fast, please stop your fast, and if needed, seek medical attention. Your safety and well-being is of utmost importance!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat being said, to everyone who will be joining, welcome~ :D\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nP.S.

Everyone commented on how they could count every bone in my body. I was pretty indifferent. Starting at about age 9, I slowly started getting chubbier, until hitting a peak of about 120 pounds with a height of about 5 feet at age 11. At this point, I didn't really like my extra chub, but I didn't completely hate it. That would come later. It was at this time that we found out I was allergic to a lot of different foods, the hardest to avoid being gluten and corn. I was on a rather restrictive diet for about a year, not to lose weight but to get over my allergies. Not only did I get over those for the most part, I lost 20 pounds in the process. I did lose most of my chub, but I still thought of myself as just as fat. Seeing pictures from a year ago really shocked me, since it hadn't registered in my mind that I was any thinner.\n\nStarting middle school at age 12, I was off the restrictive diet and over the course of a year, I gained 60 pounds. Seeing as how puberty was just starting, I doubt it was all fat, but a significant amount surely was. Regardless, it was a very difficult transition, since I was quickly outgrowing clothes and worried about what people would say. At this point, I actually stole a few of my Mom's sweatshirts, all of which I can still wear today amazingly enough. I was fearing people would give me snide comments regarding my bulk, but most of it was just neutral observations regarding my stature, like my Mom calling me a big guy (these still upset me, but it's better than getting it rubbed in my face.)\n\nOver the course of the next few years, I would gain more weight at a much slower and healthier rate. I am now 17, 5 foot 8, and weighing about 240ish pounds. I've gained about 20-30 pounds since middle school, but not very much of this appears to be fat, so my body size has been pretty stable thankfully. I've gotten used to being bigger since that massive spike in my weight at age 12, but I still wished to lose my weight, especially since I thought it would help with my gender dysphoria since my transition goals were to be rather petite. After reconnecting with my body and loving her, I've come to appreciate my body fat, not only for what the experience has taught me, but also because it's just fun to jiggle around and play with. I feel at home in my body for the first time in my life, and I love every last subatomic particle that makes her up (even the ones that make up my masculine features, they deserve love too).", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I've put on some muscle but my genetics sucks so even after 3 years I still don't look like a Chad, but people tell me that i look like I lift. \n\nNow I've had 3 girlfriends in the past but even after that and having gone on some dates, I still don't think I'm even the slightest bit attractive and still feel like I'm 284+ when I look in the mirror or see myself in pictures. I still constantly suck in my gut when I walk around in public because I feel like my stomach sticks out past my chest and whenever a girl looks in my direction I feel like she's thinking about how disgusting my body looks. I can't even bring myself to ask a girl out on a date in person because I'm just constantly thinking that she's looking at my \"fat\" and then I just basically give up in my mind before I even get close to asking. And if by some miracle I do end up dating them the entire time I'm just waiting for then to find someone that's obviously more attractive than I am and dumps me or cheats on me.\n\nI used to think I was gay because I always admired other mens bodies/faces, but I came to understand that I just really wish I could BE them. Because I hated being myself, I hated the way I look. I feel like no matter what I do, I'll always look hideous.\n\nI guess a silver lining is it made me a kind person, because I know what it's like to be made fun of because of the way you look or have insecurities.\n\nAnyways, sorry for the long post I'm just kind of wondering if anyone else currently feels or has felt this way before.

It began with easily ignored signs such as an obsession with blemishes, then it progressed to restrictive diets (a cucumber, some lettuce, an apple, and a yogurt), then eventually to plastic surgery plans. The incident today (and a few times before) is an indicator (to me) that she still struggles with her self-imposed standards, this friend of mine is an artist and she was drawing 'cats' that represented people, now of course (if you've seen my previous post, you'd know I wear a loose uniform), she drew my 'cat' as obese, with distorted facial features, and an obscenely large chest area. Ordinarily this would offend me, and I wouldn't say we are close enough for me to know this is a joke not at my expense, but for some inexplicable reason, I feel like this expresses her feelings towards her own body.

I was convinced that my destiny was to die alone and unwanted, as if it was some sort of biological fact: I was ugly, nothing more to it.\n\nEver since those days, I've started my transition, I've gone to therapy for my depression and suicidal thoughts and have even got a wonderful, loving boyfriend.

My boyfriend, , being completely asexual, has no physical or sexual attraction to me. He's with me for my personality and nothing else.

But I get very insecure at the idea of him climaxing at the sight of another woman. I worry that it subconsciously causes him to get used to seeing a beautiful woman to finish, and then the sight of me is disappointing in comparison. Obviously porn is almost going to have attractive women in it, and under my assumption that I'm unattractive, that means whoever he is watching does not look like me, because I don't exist in any of those genres. Even when considering that there are some less popular categories that feature women that aren't conventionally attractive, I don't fit in any of those either. None of them describe me. I don't want to describe what I look like, but trust me when I say that I would never be hired for any kind of those videos. Girls like me do not exist in the porn industry. It hurts to know that he'd much rather have sex with them than me. They serve as a reminder that I can't satisfy him with my physical body nearly as well as the girls he watches, and that he must be itching to have sex with one of those girls after seeing so many videos. And I've been told that it's possible for people to like different kinds of bodies simultaneously, but why would he like mine if he has seen so many better bodies. It makes me feel like I am on the lower end of girls that he likes, and that he is indifferent about having sex with me but still has to watch porn to get the experience he truly wants. I don't think he's satisfied with me. I'm scared he likes porn more than me.\n\nI've received advice on how to personally deal with him watching it, but I don't think they understand the experience I'm having, their advice will only work for people who are conventionally attractive.

This only went on for a week, but it made me addicted to disordered eating and behaviors. I was constantly looking up pro-ana \"\"diets\"\" and such, but my attempts always failed. \nThen last year, after graduating from high school, I started cutting out foods. First red meats, then soda, then cutting down on bread and such. Swearing off fries and candy. This escalated into me starting the \"IU diet\" in august.(small fact, IU actually had/has an eating disorder, self admitted, so this diet is literally what a woman going through hell ate daily) Since then, I have been deep in an eating disorder. I've spent the last 9-10 months restricting to extremely low amounts of calories and purging often. \nI know I didn't have the most drastic weight loss, and I haven't been battling an active eating disorder for years like others. But today I was able to look myself in the mirror, naked, and think, \"There is my body. And I think it looks amazing.\" I truly felt that I had a wonderful, nice, beautiful body. This is the first time I have thought this in my entire life. Never once as a kid did I have any ounce of confidence. And that makes me insanely happy. \nI'm still not ready to recover or stop restricting, but baby steps. Although, this baby step feels GIANT.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I pulled down my trousers and my god, the feeling I had, looking in the mirror, was overwhelming. I don\u2019t know what it is about changing room mirrors that makes everything so *vivid*. Maybe the lights are brighter, or the are mirrors cleaner, I don\u2019t know. But in that moment, I saw \u2018imperfections\u2019, everywhere. I am not going to go into detail, but what I saw in my reflection, particularly of my legs, was grotesque. A lot worse than I ever thought they looked like in my mirror at home. I wanted to cry. I felt myself transitioning back to hating myself. In that moment, I saw a monster. And I know my brain is playing tricks on me. I know the hatred I have for my body is due to the false societal beauty standard we have been conditioned to believe in. But that feeling in the changing room today was so intense. So overwhelming.\n\nI came home and cried and cried. I just couldn\u2019t stop crying. Everything I had learnt, every part of my body I had grown to love over my body-positivity journey, was gone, just like that. I was back to hating myself. I was back to wanting to starve myself. I haven\u2019t been on a diet for 6 months - 6 whole months of nourishing and looking after my body. But today I told myself I am not allowed to eat. For the rest of the day I didn\u2019t eat anything. I\u2019m starving. I\u2019m doing my finals rn and I have so much studying to catch up on, but right now I can\u2019t because I\u2019m starving and dizzy. At this moment, I\u2019d rather be skinny a month down the line than pass my exams.\n\nAnd this holiday I planned with my friends? I\u2019m going to tell them I can\u2019t go. I\u2019m going to tell them I don\u2019t have the money, or I\u2019m just too busy to go. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to subject the people on that beach to look at my grotesque body. And I know that feeling of self-consciousness will be intensely awful. I\u2019d rather stay in the comfort of my own home.\n\nIn the space of a day I\u2019ve fallen right back into my old habits. The hatred I had for myself before my bopo journey is back in full force. I feel so lost. I feel hurt, both physically and mentally. All of this because I decided to step into a brightly lit changing room today. I don\u2019t know what to do. The only thing I *know how* to do is not eat.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the responses guys. They really helped to reassure me.

I don't know what to do.", "author": "enough-throwaways", "self_text": "Let me give you guys some background. I never really struggled much with physical insecurity before. I recognised features of me that were subpar, but just sent them to the back of my head. This does not mean I viewed myself as gorgeous or anything, but I did think I was decently good-looking. Anyway, I didn't really think about it much.\n\nI have turned 17 this year, and perhaps this is why this has begun... but I've faced how ugly I am. Or how I perceive myself to be. I don't know. But my perception is my reality right now. And it happened all at once in the beginning -- I stared at the mirror and tallied up every single thing that was wrong. It was a fresh, unique kind of sting and hurt. Because I wasn't just sad that I was ugly. I was sad that I wasn't as pretty as other girls are, I was sad that my personality wasn't as well-interpreted as it could be because of the subconscious impression we *all* make of people based upon their looks. I was sad and horrified and embarrassed that I look like I try too hard. I love showy clothes, and when there's an event, I love going all out with dresses, makeup and heels. And I was sad that I looked like a clown trying to fit in.\n\nIt is very difficult for me to full convey the degree and nature of my insecurity \u2013 partly because it is extremely nuanced, and partly because it is composed of so many thoughts, feelings, behaviours and experiences that I cannot describe all of them in one post.\n\nBut what I really want to ask for help in is this. I've gotten to a point that when I see a pretty girl, I feel really jealous and sad. I remember all my shortcomings, I remember all the things I mentioned above and more. It cuts into me. And I stay sad and jealous and insecure and weighed down all day. Today was such a day. It's been hours since I saw that girl (and of course, my eyes scanned to every other girl, and I managed to find so much that was better in them than in me). And it's just fucking pathetic. Jealousy, envy and insecurity are really ugly features. They're horrible. They are the hallmark of low self esteem. And I really want to stop feeling that way. I can't cry whenever I see someone prettier than me. I can't do this. And I don't know how to stop. I'm trying to distract myself and focus on other things \u2013 I've been studying a lot (and yet, I saw that girl in my goddamn exam hall). I'm trying to better myself physically \u2013 eat healthy, go to the gym, take care of skin and my hair \u2013 and tell myself I'm trying to achieve the best version of myself which I can given my genetics right now. It's not working. Or it does for a while, and then I see someone and let it shatter me. I think also, the second way of trying to better myself isn't going well because I'm finding it really hard. I fall off the bandwagon a lot in all of those things because I'm in the middle of exams. I also used to fall off the tracks when I wasn't in the middle of exams, but I'm trying to better my discipline. I just find all of those things so hard. And I guess if I'm not doing them well enough, I have no right to complain. I don't know. I feel pathetic for finding basic self care things so taxing.\n\nSo... yeah. Maybe someone relates, or has some advice. I don't know. Thank you for reading.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

Beautiful dresses, emotional speeches, and reuniting with those I haven't seen in a long while. I'm a hopeless romantic but events that have a lot of pictures involved always stress me out.\n\n*In Fall 2017*, I was at a best friend's wedding. All I could think about was weight.  I had just started dating my boyfriend. I had a blossoming eating disorder. I remember stressing about the food there, stressing about the pictures after, crying in the car for hours with my patient boyfriend. I was determined to lose weight and despite his protests, I was convinced that I just needed to lose more weight to keep his affection. This fueled a lot of drama.\n\n*In Summer 2018*, I went to several weddings. It was the year for all of my close friends to get married. My boyfriend and I had broken up, after months of him patiently dealing with my destructive eating disorder, but then me self-consciously cheating on him. Although I had plus-oned him to two weddings, I went alone to all of them. I was very thin, I had to alter my bridesmaid dress.  I had so many compliments, but I had gotten to the dream weight by losing everything. I remember reflecting on the \"love is..\" passage of scripture (1 Corinthians 13) and thinking about all the things that love is...they are all character related, none image related. I was skinny, but I had become unfaithful and self-focused. I was determined to be better.\n\n*In Spring 2019,* my boyfriend and I were back together. I went to his brother's wedding. It was amazing the amount of forgiveness I received. I was a bridesmaid, despite everything.  I had gained back so much, including weight. But I was happy. The night after the wedding rehearsal I took out my stressed boyfriend to eat at a McDonald's and he was just in awe of how I wasn't embarrassed eating in front of him anymore. He told me it was insanely sexy.  I put my heart and soul into helping things run smoothly. I felt so loved.\n\n...but after it was over, anxious thoughts begin to creep in again. I felt self conscious about everything in retrospect, from the speech the bride asked me to do last minute, to the pictures that were released. One in particular haunted me. The photographer caught me off guard and asked me to pose with my boyfriend. Instead of sitting up straight I kind of melted into his arms, slouching and my stomach is sticking out. I spent hours staring at that photo. I'm in a ballgown but I look like a total slob. I don't have many fancy photos with my boyfriend (he never dresses up) and it made me wish that I still had my skinny figure. His brother's wife is a fashion-designer and looks like a supermodel. Image and posing are a part of her career.\n\nI know if I saw that photo when I was heartbroken last summer I would have been so elated to know I was at the wedding, back together with my boyfriend, and had earned back the trust of his family. But I keep slipping back to obsessive thinking.\n\nNow it's summer and I'm starting to get obsessive thoughts again about losing weight in time for the next wedding I have scheduled a month from a half and now.  I want to be thin again but I am worried about losing myself. But I also want to look good next to my boyfriend, his brother, and his fashion designer sister-in-law.\n\ntldr: my eating disorder/self-focused behavior ruined my relationship with my bf, but I looked good in wedding photos as a bridesmaid.

I had never had surgery before, but I wasn't even worried about it, because of how routine the procedure is. I am stubborn and went to work the day after my wisdom teeth removal, which led to me developing dry sockets. I was so sick and in so much pain that I lost 20 lbs in a week and a half. I started to recover from that when toward the end of February the rapid weight loss caught up with me, and my gallbladder became inflamed, infected and full of stones. I ended up losing 25 lbs overall, which was 15% of my body weight. It happened so fast, and while it was happening I was just trying to stay alive, and keep up with my job and graduate school. (When I came back to work after my gallbladder removal my manager even commented \"look at your new skinny body\") Now, months later, the weight is still off. I am smaller now than I have ever been. I hardly recognize myself. I constantly look at my body and all the parts that are much smaller and different now.  People keep commenting on how good I look, and how they've noticed my weight loss.

I don\u2019t know how I can accept the way I look. Sometimes I think I look fine as hell and I\u2019m a thicc goddess, and other times I hate myself. Does anyone else relate to this?

Thanks everyone, for your wholehearted participation and support~~~ :D**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGreetings to everyone here on r/fatlogic!!! :D\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, 6 May is upon us all again. Apparently, this day is also some so-called \"International No Diet Day\", which many of those HAES/FA cultists venerate, and go all out to avoid \"being on a diet\" on this day. Though, then again, \"avoiding diets\" is an everyday occurrence for them, but this day is symbolically more important to them, so... o.o\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyway, using an idea that I came across on this sub years ago, for the past few years, every time 6 May comes around, I have decided to join in the festivities, by going on a 24-hour fast on this day every year! I too, am going \"no diet\" on this day as well! This, as the word \"diet\" refers to the foodstuff one consumes in their daily lives, hence, wouldn't \"no diet\" equals to no food consumed at all? &gt;:D\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHad been \"promoting\" this for the past few weeks on and off on this sub, but, if anyone wants to, feel free to join me on this fast, from 0000 Hrs on 6 May, until 0000 Hrs on 7 May, based off your local timezone? Please take note of the important caveats listed below if you intend to join before \"checking-in\" in this thread, and I wish you all the best in your 24-hour fast today. :)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nImportant caveats:\n\n* THIS EVENT IS COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY.\n\n* DO NOT JOIN THIS EVENT IF YOU EVER HAD A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OF ANY EATING DISORDER. Instead, please use this day to focus on your recovery. Take care!\n\n* IF YOU ARE NOT FEELING WELL, PLEASE DO NOT JOIN AS WELL. There is a risk of aggravating any current illness you might have, which is a risk I will rather avoid. Please rest well!\n\n* \"Starvation mode\" does not exist, at least, in the manner that those HAES/FA cultists put it. \"Dehydration mode\" however, does exist, and is potentially lethal! Please ensure adequate water consumption, but don't go overboard and end up with \"electrolyte imbalance mode\", which could be lethal as well...\n\n* If you are not feeling well during the course of the 24-hour fast, please stop your fast, and if needed, seek medical attention. Your safety and well-being is of utmost importance!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThat being said, to everyone who will be joining, welcome~ :D\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nP.S.

Everyone commented on how they could count every bone in my body. I was pretty indifferent. Starting at about age 9, I slowly started getting chubbier, until hitting a peak of about 120 pounds with a height of about 5 feet at age 11. At this point, I didn't really like my extra chub, but I didn't completely hate it. That would come later. It was at this time that we found out I was allergic to a lot of different foods, the hardest to avoid being gluten and corn. I was on a rather restrictive diet for about a year, not to lose weight but to get over my allergies. Not only did I get over those for the most part, I lost 20 pounds in the process. I did lose most of my chub, but I still thought of myself as just as fat. Seeing pictures from a year ago really shocked me, since it hadn't registered in my mind that I was any thinner.\n\nStarting middle school at age 12, I was off the restrictive diet and over the course of a year, I gained 60 pounds. Seeing as how puberty was just starting, I doubt it was all fat, but a significant amount surely was. Regardless, it was a very difficult transition, since I was quickly outgrowing clothes and worried about what people would say. At this point, I actually stole a few of my Mom's sweatshirts, all of which I can still wear today amazingly enough. I was fearing people would give me snide comments regarding my bulk, but most of it was just neutral observations regarding my stature, like my Mom calling me a big guy (these still upset me, but it's better than getting it rubbed in my face.)\n\nOver the course of the next few years, I would gain more weight at a much slower and healthier rate. I am now 17, 5 foot 8, and weighing about 240ish pounds. I've gained about 20-30 pounds since middle school, but not very much of this appears to be fat, so my body size has been pretty stable thankfully. I've gotten used to being bigger since that massive spike in my weight at age 12, but I still wished to lose my weight, especially since I thought it would help with my gender dysphoria since my transition goals were to be rather petite. After reconnecting with my body and loving her, I've come to appreciate my body fat, not only for what the experience has taught me, but also because it's just fun to jiggle around and play with. I feel at home in my body for the first time in my life, and I love every last subatomic particle that makes her up (even the ones that make up my masculine features, they deserve love too).", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I've put on some muscle but my genetics sucks so even after 3 years I still don't look like a Chad, but people tell me that i look like I lift. \n\nNow I've had 3 girlfriends in the past but even after that and having gone on some dates, I still don't think I'm even the slightest bit attractive and still feel like I'm 284+ when I look in the mirror or see myself in pictures. I still constantly suck in my gut when I walk around in public because I feel like my stomach sticks out past my chest and whenever a girl looks in my direction I feel like she's thinking about how disgusting my body looks. I can't even bring myself to ask a girl out on a date in person because I'm just constantly thinking that she's looking at my \"fat\" and then I just basically give up in my mind before I even get close to asking.

It began with easily ignored signs such as an obsession with blemishes, then it progressed to restrictive diets (a cucumber, some lettuce, an apple, and a yogurt), then eventually to plastic surgery plans. The incident today (and a few times before) is an indicator (to me) that she still struggles with her self-imposed standards, this friend of mine is an artist and she was drawing 'cats' that represented people, now of course (if you've seen my previous post, you'd know I wear a loose uniform), she drew my 'cat' as obese, with distorted facial features, and an obscenely large chest area. Ordinarily this would offend me, and I wouldn't say we are close enough for me to know this is a joke not at my expense, but for some inexplicable reason, I feel like this expresses her feelings towards her own body.

I worry that it subconsciously causes him to get used to seeing a beautiful woman to finish, and then the sight of me is disappointing in comparison.

I don't want to describe what I look like, but trust me when I say that I would never be hired for any kind of those videos. Girls like me do not exist in the porn industry. It hurts to know that he'd much rather have sex with them than me. They serve as a reminder that I can't satisfy him with my physical body nearly as well as the girls he watches, and that he must be itching to have sex with one of those girls after seeing so many videos. And I've been told that it's possible for people to like different kinds of bodies simultaneously, but why would he like mine if he has seen so many better bodies. It makes me feel like I am on the lower end of girls that he likes, and that he is indifferent about having sex with me but still has to watch porn to get the experience he truly wants. I don't think he's satisfied with me. I'm scared he likes porn more than me.\n\nI've received advice on how to personally deal with him watching it, but I don't think they understand the experience I'm having, their advice will only work for people who are conventionally attractive.

Maybe the lights are brighter, or the are mirrors cleaner, I don\u2019t know. But in that moment, I saw \u2018imperfections\u2019, everywhere. I am not going to go into detail, but what I saw in my reflection, particularly of my legs, was grotesque. A lot worse than I ever thought they looked like in my mirror at home. I wanted to cry. I felt myself transitioning back to hating myself. In that moment, I saw a monster. And I know my brain is playing tricks on me. I know the hatred I have for my body is due to the false societal beauty standard we have been conditioned to believe in. But that feeling in the changing room today was so intense. So overwhelming.\n\nI came home and cried and cried. I just couldn\u2019t stop crying. Everything I had learnt, every part of my body I had grown to love over my body-positivity journey, was gone, just like that. I was back to hating myself. I was back to wanting to starve myself. I haven\u2019t been on a diet for 6 months - 6 whole months of nourishing and looking after my body. But today I told myself I am not allowed to eat. For the rest of the day I didn\u2019t eat anything. I\u2019m starving. I\u2019m doing my finals rn and I have so much studying to catch up on, but right now I can\u2019t because I\u2019m starving and dizzy.

I\u2019m going to tell them I don\u2019t have the money, or I\u2019m just too busy to go. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to subject the people on that beach to look at my grotesque body. And I know that feeling of self-consciousness will be intensely awful. I\u2019d rather stay in the comfort of my own home.\n\nIn the space of a day I\u2019ve fallen right back into my old habits. The hatred I had for myself before my bopo journey is back in full force. I feel so lost. I feel hurt, both physically and mentally. All of this because I decided to step into a brightly lit changing room today. I don\u2019t know what to do. The only thing I *know how* to do is not eat.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the responses guys. They really helped to reassure me.

Really no one else comments on my weight, but my mom keeps on doing so and it really frustrates me. I can't just live my life without being bombarded with how fat I am and how I need to lose weight. She just does it so casually and it really hurts. Like sometimes I would be in my room studying or doing something and she would come in and touch my stomach and tell me that it's getting big and that I need to lose weight. And sometimes she would say something like \"do you really want to go out like that during the summer? You would be alot prettier if you lost weight.\" What's worse is that once I went to the doctor(not related to weight. It was because I have asthma) and during the check up the doctor asked me to step on the scale and he said that my weight is ideal for my weight and height. But my mother was there and responded with \"no she needs to lose weight.\" I also remember that once I went to ask my mom if I was fat and she said \"yes have you seen how huge your thighs are?\" It's really frustrating. I can't breathe without my mom commenting on my weight although I'm perfectly healthy and I think that I look fine.

I don't know what to do.", "author": "enough-throwaways", "self_text": "Let me give you guys some background. I never really struggled much with physical insecurity before. I recognised features of me that were subpar, but just sent them to the back of my head. This does not mean I viewed myself as gorgeous or anything, but I did think I was decently good-looking. Anyway, I didn't really think about it much.\n\nI have turned 17 this year, and perhaps this is why this has begun... but I've faced how ugly I am. Or how I perceive myself to be. I don't know. But my perception is my reality right now. And it happened all at once in the beginning -- I stared at the mirror and tallied up every single thing that was wrong. It was a fresh, unique kind of sting and hurt. Because I wasn't just sad that I was ugly. I was sad that I wasn't as pretty as other girls are, I was sad that my personality wasn't as well-interpreted as it could be because of the subconscious impression we *all* make of people based upon their looks. I was sad and horrified and embarrassed that I look like I try too hard. I love showy clothes, and when there's an event, I love going all out with dresses, makeup and heels. And I was sad that I looked like a clown trying to fit in.\n\nIt is very difficult for me to full convey the degree and nature of my insecurity \u2013 partly because it is extremely nuanced, and partly because it is composed of so many thoughts, feelings, behaviours and experiences that I cannot describe all of them in one post.\n\nBut what I really want to ask for help in is this. I've gotten to a point that when I see a pretty girl, I feel really jealous and sad. I remember all my shortcomings, I remember all the things I mentioned above and more. It cuts into me. And I stay sad and jealous and insecure and weighed down all day. Today was such a day. It's been hours since I saw that girl (and of course, my eyes scanned to every other girl, and I managed to find so much that was better in them than in me). And it's just fucking pathetic. Jealousy, envy and insecurity are really ugly features. They're horrible. They are the hallmark of low self esteem. And I really want to stop feeling that way. I can't cry whenever I see someone prettier than me. I can't do this. And I don't know how to stop. I'm trying to distract myself and focus on other things \u2013 I've been studying a lot (and yet, I saw that girl in my goddamn exam hall). I'm trying to better myself physically \u2013 eat healthy, go to the gym, take care of skin and my hair \u2013 and tell myself I'm trying to achieve the best version of myself which I can given my genetics right now. It's not working. Or it does for a while, and then I see someone and let it shatter me. I think also, the second way of trying to better myself isn't going well because I'm finding it really hard. I fall off the bandwagon a lot in all of those things because I'm in the middle of exams. I also used to fall off the tracks when I wasn't in the middle of exams, but I'm trying to better my discipline. I just find all of those things so hard. And I guess if I'm not doing them well enough, I have no right to complain. I don't know. I feel pathetic for finding basic self care things so taxing.\n\nSo... yeah.

I keep going on off again on again diets and why just why can't I stick with one I wish I could eat like 0 calories a day bc at least then I'd know id be safe from gaining anymore weight. I know I'm rambling right now but I just can't go out there and fake a smile when I feel like I could tear out of my skin and start screaming and breaking down any second. I hate pretending to be happy, the stupid fake laugh and smile like I'm not debating on ending my life as we speak.

How do you stay centered, selfless, and relaxed at image-focused events?", "author": "lovelylefthander", "self_text": "First of all, I love weddings. Beautiful dresses, emotional speeches, and reuniting with those I haven't seen in a long while. I'm a hopeless romantic but events that have a lot of pictures involved always stress me out.\n\n*In Fall 2017*, I was at a best friend's wedding. All I could think about was weight.  I had just started dating my boyfriend. I had a blossoming eating disorder. I remember stressing about the food there, stressing about the pictures after, crying in the car for hours with my patient boyfriend. I was determined to lose weight and despite his protests, I was convinced that I just needed to lose more weight to keep his affection. This fueled a lot of drama.\n\n*In Summer 2018*, I went to several weddings. It was the year for all of my close friends to get married. My boyfriend and I had broken up, after months of him patiently dealing with my destructive eating disorder, but then me self-consciously cheating on him. Although I had plus-oned him to two weddings, I went alone to all of them. I was very thin, I had to alter my bridesmaid dress.  I had so many compliments, but I had gotten to the dream weight by losing everything. I remember reflecting on the \"love is..\" passage of scripture (1 Corinthians 13) and thinking about all the things that love is...they are all character related, none image related. I was skinny, but I had become unfaithful and self-focused. I was determined to be better.\n\n*In Spring 2019,* my boyfriend and I were back together. I went to his brother's wedding. It was amazing the amount of forgiveness I received. I was a bridesmaid, despite everything.  I had gained back so much, including weight. But I was happy. The night after the wedding rehearsal I took out my stressed boyfriend to eat at a McDonald's and he was just in awe of how I wasn't embarrassed eating in front of him anymore. He told me it was insanely sexy.  I put my heart and soul into helping things run smoothly. I felt so loved.\n\n...but after it was over, anxious thoughts begin to creep in again. I felt self conscious about everything in retrospect, from the speech the bride asked me to do last minute, to the pictures that were released. One in particular haunted me. The photographer caught me off guard and asked me to pose with my boyfriend. Instead of sitting up straight I kind of melted into his arms, slouching and my stomach is sticking out. I spent hours staring at that photo. I'm in a ballgown but I look like a total slob. I don't have many fancy photos with my boyfriend (he never dresses up) and it made me wish that I still had my skinny figure. His brother's wife is a fashion-designer and looks like a supermodel. Image and posing are a part of her career.\n\nI know if I saw that photo when I was heartbroken last summer I would have been so elated to know I was at the wedding, back together with my boyfriend, and had earned back the trust of his family. But I keep slipping back to obsessive thinking.\n\nNow it's summer and I'm starting to get obsessive thoughts again about losing weight in time for the next wedding I have scheduled a month from a half and now.  I want to be thin again but I am worried about losing myself. But I also want to look good next to my boyfriend, his brother, and his fashion designer sister-in-law.\n\ntldr: my eating disorder/self-focused behavior ruined my relationship with my bf, but I looked good in wedding photos as a bridesmaid. Then i recovered and we got back together and attended another wedding (also a bridesmaid) but now I want to lose weight after seeing those wedding pictures so I can be skinny for the next wedding we attend together.", "subreddit": "BodyAcceptance"}

I recently posted an innocent photo of me at dinner in a tank top and all the comments were literally 'omg look at your tits'. Again, some may find this complimentary, I find this depressing, as I'm literally being reduced to these two milk sacks.\n\nNB: I would not consider getting them reduced.
