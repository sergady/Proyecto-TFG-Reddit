Every time I asked for help or told her I thought I was depressed she would turn it on me. She used to tell me I'm looking for attention, I'm not depressed and I'm making her depressed by misbehaving etc. I really struggled as I never fit in, I stopped going to school and being a antisocial teenager. I was also bullied a lot in school and by 'friends' to the extent I was too scared to go to school. \nWhen I was 17 I was thrown out of my mums house and had to live with my dad. (because I didn't go to school that day) He left me alone with no money and no heating on a regular basis as he was at his girlfriends doing drugs. Eventually I had to move out of there as I found a dirty needle on the bathroom floor and one amongst my clothes.\nAt the age of 17 I was homeless, had to leave school as I needed to look for a job to support myself and then my dad died a month or two after that. He was found dead on his living room floor. The cause of death was heroin, cocaine and valium overdose. \nThe next couple of years I spiraled downwards. Drinking was what numbed me. I ended up in a mentally abusive then turned violent relationship but I had to courage to leave after he attacked me andbarricaded me in his flat. \n\nA year or so after that I fell pregnant. The best thing to ever happen to me was falling pregnant and being with my now fiance.\nI've always really struggled with mental health problems and I think I possibly have BPD.

Too scared to leave the house etc etc. It's really damaged me and messed me up in the head :'( \n\nI know i shouldnt (as it's illegal where I am) but I've been smoking weed near enough daily other than when I was pregnant for 7/8 years. It keeps my anger under control and makes me feel a bit better. I know I should really stop but it's been a crutch for so many years I don't think I can go without it without the bad dreams coming back. \n\nThere is probably so much more to this I haven't included but these are the main points.

Being called a bitch, stupid, etc everyday. My Dad &amp; sister were/are also abused by her. I moved to a different state in my 20s when I met my husband. Unfortunately I married an alcoholic and now he is sick with cirrhosis. Back in July he had bad complications from the cirrhosis and was in a coma for several days. When your the only one working...paying bills and buying medicine it doesn't take long to blow threw savings. So my parents told us that we could move in with them(my dad still lives with my mom). Of course I knew this would be a huge mistake since my mother is still abusive. Since moving back at the beginning of August Ive lost count of how many times shes called me a drama queen, psycho, that I need help, that she wants me to move. I'm devastated...even though I don't think I would have made it much longer on my income alone I left a decent job(making 12 an hour) and a nice apartment. I moved back because they said they would help and now shes saying move. I know my husband and I need to leave but his cirrhosis had him in the hospital three times last month.

I\u2019m young (only 20) and so is he. When I met him he was the sweetest person I\u2019ve ever met. He gave me so much attention and security that I never got from anyone because I never opened up to anyone unless they made me feel reassured. A few months after we began seeing each other, some sides of his personality started to show but I ignored them because in all honesty I let him take my virginity and back then that was very serious for me. He would tell me if I broke up with him he would kill himself and just different red flags like that so I didn\u2019t ever think much of it because... I honestly just wasn\u2019t taking it seriously. He began slowly comparing me to his ex girlfriend. Saying things like \u00ab\u00a0why can\u2019t you smoke more. my last girlfriend would roll all our blunts and could outsmoke all my friends.\u00a0\u00bb or \u00ab\u00a0shower with me. my last girlfriend and i would do it all the time.\u00a0\u00bb or \u00ab\u00a0why are you so awkward when you smoke. my last girl would be close with my friends\u00a0\u00bb etc; etc. This was all very hurtful to me because I was compared directly to her and she\u2019s honestly a lot cooler and prettier than I am. A few times he even called me by her name. One time before we were about to have sex, I was on my period. I was really embarrassed about this because we hadn\u2019t ever dealt with this situation before so I got a little insecure when I realized it. He said \u00ab\u00a0its okay, ive done it before a lot\u00a0with my ex\u00a0\u00bb literally while we were in bed... this all really took a damper on my confidence until one day it got worse. We got into a fight and I noticed he had followed his ex girlfriend on Twitter. I confronted him about it and he acted like it was nothing. About a week passed and he broke up with me, I was young and it was my first break up so i melted down crying in the mall with my friend. I tried to hard to be the best girl I could for him. I even spent hours looking for his Christmas present, wrapping it as nicely as I could, just for him to tell me I could take it back (it was a nice shirt and some other things but I guess he didn\u2019t like the shirt so he handed it back to me). So, this all felt really harsh. We ended up getting back together that night because he said he was willing to give it another chance, and he said sorry that he didn\u2019t reply all day because he decided to try to sell wax, and got pulled over with a felony amount of wax in his car. Couple months pass and he\u2019s on probation. Someone at lunch (because I was in highschool when this happened) mentioned something to me nonchalantly about him being still in love with his ex girlfriend. So, I decided to message her since he did talk about her all the time to me. She sent me screenshots of him begging for her back and telling her he was only using me to get over her. He also told her a bunch of sweet stuff he never said to me. I freaked out since he cheated on me (sent all this while we were dating) and tweeted out that he was a cheater. This was really immature of me to do but I was so hurt by the fact that I already suspected this and had asked him about it before while he lied to me for months. I also felt so insecure from how he had compared me so much to the person he ended up cheating with. My tweet had him go to a mental hospital because he is suicidal. I wasn\u2019t thinking when I tweeted and called him out for what he did publicly but it did effect him and I genuinely regret being so bitter in this moment. He got out and we decided to try again. We both acknowledged that we did things out of spite and were wrong so I figured it would be okay. For the next year after that, we would fight constantly. I would be incredibly mean to him in an effort to control the situation and for a while, I was verbally abusive myself towards him. I was so mad. I would start fights and break up with him etc. it was a very toxic time but over time I got over the cheating and emotional trauma I felt from being compared to this girl. Now, a couple years later, he has been on probation for 6 months and has violated it many times. He\u2019s on the verge of going to jail now, and has become a severe alcoholic since he can\u2019t smoke anymore. He drinks in the mornings after he tests, and at night if he does not test the next day. lately hes been waking me up at 8 am to start drinking and i refuse to drink with him because he is very mean when he drinks. a couple weeks ago, I hadnt seen him in a while so I wasn\u2019t sure how bad he had gotten but there was some argument that I genuinely did not start, and he threw me into a ping pong table and then onto the ground. then he threw cold water on me and told me to get out of his house but I could not drive because (like I said, i had not realized his alcoholism at this point) I had a few shots with him. I was so surprised he was asking me to drive in that state and giving me really no option. So, fast forward a couple weeks and I stopped drinking with him because I refuse to enable his behavior. I tell him i dont want to drink wth him because hes mean while drunk and he tries to persuade me but i 9/10 times say no. Every morning he wakes me up after he tests to beg me to drink. The thought of alcohol makes me sick that early in the morning and the fact that I have now been waking up to him drinking, the smell of rum, or him passed out from being wasted has really gotten me fed up and ive completely lost my desire to drink honestly. Well, yesterday, he woke me up at 8 am and would not stop until 10 am when I finally got fed up enough and said that I would take 2 shots with him. I was really irritated at this point so I was making some snarky remarks about how I wish I could sleep etc. This offended him and he brought up the fact that I had been with other men while we were broken up. One of the men was the same one from another break up a while ago- and I see why this would effect him but I told him straight up that I was with this man again. He got really mad and started saying i was going to make him punch another hole in the wall. i said it wasnt my fault and then he continued on getting more and more mad, telling me he could find another person better than me in 2 seconds if he wanted to. Saying I should go back to Kyle, (the name I\u2019m giving the other guy), even though I\u2019ve made it clear that I don\u2019t care about him. I can\u2019t get too mad when he does this because I know that\u2019s how I felt when he tried to go back to his ex. However, yesterday when we were fighting he started getting physical. He grabbed me by my hair and threw me into the corner of the ping pong table again. I was reluctant to drive home with 2 shots in my system (because I refuse usually to drive with any alcohol at all in my system- even while hungover). I went back into his room to go grab my things when he got up and threw me onto the bed in choking position and i tried squirming away and he said he was going to kill the boys i was with and then grabbed me by my boob and ripped my tanktop, started slapping and scratching me and then finally his mom came down to break it up. I left and hungout with my friend. I tried to apologize to him for the fight since this time I kind of started it by being so irritated in the morning. I confronted him for getting physical and he said he didn\u2019t remember it happening so hes not sorry because it didnt happen. I have pictures of the scratches that I sent to him. We moved past it like always because for me breaking up is too hard of an option as I\u2019ve tried to many times and feel so dependent on him. I hungout with him and my friends last night for NYE at his house. It was really uncomfortable and I remember being high and just laughing a lot at things to avoid the awkward tension since none of my friends like him. My friend i was with knew what happened so she was really reluctant to go. ALSO- before we went, he had been drunk driving and rear ended someone. He somehow got out of this situation but drank last night and pretty sure he missed a test today (another violation for probation). He told me last night that it was my last night with him because he was probably going to jail and i started sobbing because i would miss him so much but he just blacked out and fell asleep. This morning he did it again, waking me up to drink and instead of getting mad in fear of another fight like yesterdays, I just removed myself from his room to sleep on the couch. He decided to drink by himself as always and I walked into his room when I woke up to see he wet the bed...the second time this has happened. I asked him eventually to take me home and on the way home he was sobbing and saying he was going to kill himself, and watch over me in heaven. This really freaks me out. Yesterday he told me if I broke up with him he would tell everyone my secrets but he also talks about breaking up constantly because he doesnt feel like hes good enough. I dont know what to do, how to help him, or how to help myself. I love him so much. I have no friends. Really none- you can look at a different post that talks about how I lost them all I posted another week. I come here to vent so I hope someone has some advice for me. I dont want to enable his behavior and i want him to get help but idk how. he goes to AA he has been to rehab. i dont want him to go to jail and i dont want to stop seeing him because i am so attached but sometimes i am scared of him. AND i need to point out hes a really cool person when sober. i mean sometimes hes mean or depressed and takes this stuff out on me even sober but he really is fun for me to be around. i look back to the person i met when i met him and how terribly everything has gone. if he had just stayed home and turned off his phone the day he simultaneously cheated and got pulled over then none of this would be happening. he wouldnt be on probation wouldnt be an alcoholic and i wouldnt have been miserable and probably ruined a lot of our relationship for so long. just i need someone to listen to me because i have really no friends to tell and cant tell my mom who gets so worried. so yeah.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I am relatively new to the idea of narcissism, or that there is an actual name for my abuse until I started researching and reading this thread.\n\nMy nex broke up with me first when I told him I felt lonely and was going home for Christmas to spend time with my family (I'm living abroad and overseas in his home country).  He was so upset I \"didnt consult him\" in my decision, when in reality I had tried to tell him how alone and unsupported I felt so many times and as recently as the night prior but he either berated or ignored me when I tried.\n\nHe ended it as a result of my alleged failure to consult with him, but shockingly paid for my flight. Over the next week he was cold, then warm, then cold and finally on my last night before departure he cuddled me and told me he wanted to \"see where it goes\". He informed me he was still hurt and angry I didnt consult him and that I still hadn't apologised (he dumped me?!). He drove me to the airport the next morning and we had a gentle and sweet goodbye.  \n\nAfter a day across the pond he started ghosting. We would make plans to talk, but as always, he would unapolagetically reach out hours late or the next day.  If he couldn't reach me he would leave my messages on read and again make me wait for the next day.\n\nFinally, after 4 days of torture I told him we should take some time without talking to clear our heads and he was cold and short in his compliance. I tried reaching out 5 days later to wish him a merry Christmas and i was met with a cold and emotionless response hours later.  I didn't press or argue or engage, I just recently learned to let him be when he's like that. \n\nAfter returning home on NYE (we live together), he was still icing me out. He opted to work all day and went out for NYE without me. I said fine and acted nonchalantly. He came home drunk last night and wanted to cuddle and was trying to be intimate all of a sudden. He told me he had missed me.  I asked him if he thought we had been together this whole time (I had a suspicion he had been with someone else). He said no. I asked if he had slept with someone, he said no. I pressed again and he admitted to sleeping with someone after I \"broke it off when I said we should take some time not speaking\". \n\nHe was cold and unapologetic but he had a look in his eyes as if he were trying to look sympathetic (never seen him do that before).\n\nHe casually said he must have misinterpreted my text but did not apologise.  After a few minutes of asking questions it was clear he had no remorse.  I asked if it was the only time he's slept with someone else and he said no. First he said he had cheated 2-3 months ago, then he changed it to 7-8 months ago.  When I asked where or when he said \"it doesn't concern you\". When I asked why he said \"I found her attractive\".  He said it was not uncommon and pretty normal for people to cheat, and ok as long as they're honest about it (which he obviously wasnt).  He told me he thinks I'm his soulmate and the ball is still in my court what I want to do with this info.\n\nEventually I got up and said I was leaving and he just rolled over and fell asleep. I left the house and blocked him on everything but was told by my other flatmate that today he was sitting at home laughing and joking as always like nothing had happened. \n\nWhy did he come clean about his cheating? \n\nWas he just drunk and let his guard down?\n\nDid he even cheat or was this another power play to hurt me and get rid of me?\n\nAny advice or input would be so appreciated x\n Thanks and cheers to a narc free 2019 !!\n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Obviously I was new to a lot of things but I listened to her wants and needs and she always acted that she was perfectly content with our sex life and never said anything was wrong. She was a very sexual person in the beginning and pushed me into that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with our first few times together being that I was a virgin (I told her I was uncomfortable and that I wanted to take it slower but she didn\u2019t seem to care). I started to get more comfortable in time and things seemed great.\n\nExcept for the fact that in the course of our 3.5 year relationship, she only made me finish twice. And even that felt forced. So that\u2019s something I\u2019m trying to keep in mind right now as she wasn\u2019t a good partner at all but her words still hurt. \n\nI did communicate that I wasn\u2019t happy with our sex life to her during our relationship in the best way I knew how given that I had no experience before her. Just like I tried to communicate with her in all other aspects of our relationship. I thought there must be something wrong with me that I can\u2019t even enjoy sex and she made me feel like it was because I had no experience and didn\u2019t know how to enjoy having someone touch me. \n\nAfter the first 6 months or so, she was rarely the one to initiate, and when she did want to have sex, she had little to no consideration for my wants or needs and/or rarely reciprocated. I felt unwanted and silly for continuing to try to please someone who seemed to see sex as a one-sided thing. It was always about just her. I was open with her about how I felt during our relationship and now 7 months after discard she turns around and says this out of the blue and I think this hurts more than any of the endless name-calling she did towards me during our relationship. At least other people can tell me her name-calling wasn\u2019t true. She was my first so my first instinct is to believe her because I haven\u2019t been with anyone else. \n\nHalf of me realizes that she\u2019s just saying what she can to get to me. Half of me feels insecure because she was my first and what she said really hurt. I\u2019ve been much better at rarely checking up on her but as my New Years Resolution I\u2019m deciding to never do it again. By doing so I\u2019m only continuing to subject myself to more abuse that I should\u2019ve escaped at the end of our relationship. \n\nHas anyone else ever had a nex say something along these lines or guilt trip you about sex? I already felt unwanted and that I wasn\u2019t enough during our relationship and now I feel even worse. She knew it would get to me and I fell right into it. Maybe she\u2019s projecting, I don\u2019t know. I have to remember the fact that she never satisfied me either, but at least I was trying. I know the kind of person she is and that I shouldn\u2019t take her words to heart. But regardless like all of the other things she\u2019s said about me, it still hurts and I feel horrible right now. I see it as a reflection on myself. I\u2019m just now getting to the point where I\u2019m ready to start being casual with other people and now I feel like a joke.

I find it very hard to get angry and cause pain to people I love. Because of this, being friends with this person who I'll call 'A' has been very difficult. I recently stumbled onto the term 'covert narcissism'  and it's really opened my eyes to this recently ended relationship. It's also helped me sort through my feelings, as I felt for years that I was being a horrible friend. I guess I want to list this to get feedback, partially to sort through my emotions.   \n\n\nI ended the friendship with A about 5 months ago. We are in the same kind of career together that has a low success rate. I've found a spot for myself to make a comfortable living and I'm proud of myself. A was in a slightly different, but adjacent area and didn't have such good luck. (I'm being a bit vague about my career as it's a huge giveaway so forgive me!) Throughout the relationship there was an obvious jealously but I tried my best to navigate it, as I can understand how hard it can be in that situation (such as not mentioning overtly my successes and trying to helping A get a leg up). We were very close, but I was closer to their partner (who I'll call B) moreso who they are still with. Part of me feared especially losing that relationship with B, which unfortunately happened recently when B told me they wanted me out of their life.\n\nI could give a blow by blow of this relationship with A, but here's just some highlights. Has anyone experienced the same problems?\n\n\\- Would ask to stay over at my apartment constantly so to be closer to events.\n\n\\- Never congratulated me for anything.\n\n\\- Often minimized my successes that I was just in an easier career.\n\n\\- Would be awful at empathizing with me. When I had a problem they'd be weirdly distant. Unless it confirmed something about a person they hated...\n\n\\- Often got close to people that I had received abuse and negativity from (almost intentionally??)\n\n\\- Gossiped constantly to me about others. Nobody was ever good enough.\n\n\\- Often 'told on' my other friends about small things they had done/said about me, and made me confront them when i'd normally be unbothered about a slightly off comment.\n\n\\- I worked on something with A and feared their reactions to everything. They wouldn't talk to me for a week once when I pointed out something practical about their work that I thought could help.\n\n\\- I was often terrified of them, as their mood shifted wildly.\n\n\\- They couldn't take criticism and would get sullen and angry.\n\n\\- Would often ice me out for weeks or months randomly. Often after big successes in my career.\n\n\\- In arguments they would infer things like 'clearly I'm just a horrible person and you've always hated me' to simple criticisms or just wanting to talk.\n\n\\- Once left me alone on the streets after a group dinner while I had a panic attack after weeks of icing me out. Some lines got crossed and my partner accused A of being a bad friend and abandoning me (a mistake I know) and A refused to talk to me for a month and accused me of being a terrible friend along with other horrible accusations. They never asked how I was afterwards, just pretended that it never happened after a month when they deemed it okay for me to talk to them.\n\n\\- In these moments of 'icing me out' A would randomly leave me passive aggressive comments or accuse me of being too clingy for sending more then 2-3 messsages in a month-two months period.\n\n\\- B once professed that they were scared of A and would rather be alone, but it was too difficult to break up. This rose alarm bells.\n\n\\- I've chatted with mutual friends and a few who aren't all that close to A have told me that they're perfectly fine and sane, and I was in the wrong because A told them this or that, or I should just smooth things over. A is very charismatic and I worry about talking with my friends at all about this.\n\nAfter a huge breakthrough in my career, A just stopped talking with me even though I tried to maintain contact. They had moved states anyways and the fear I had around them was too much and I just kind of slowly started quietly deleting them from social media.   \n\n\nI'm zero contact with A and B now. I miss B a huge amount and I worry for them. But there's nothing I can do. I am on meds and in therapy for anxiety and what I think was longterm, subtle emotional abuse. This has been very cathartic to write out honestly because looking back their behavior was not okay.  \n\n\nSo I guess to relate back to the title - has anyone else experienced this kind of narcissistic abuse? Being made to feel like you're the 'bad guy' in situations. But being too frightened to confront them with it.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I admit them, I will here as well. I\u2019ve done CRAZY insane things, checked underwear, gone through phones, read texts, seen DM\u2019s. I\u2019ve been on all sides of crazy, I know this I\u2019ve cried over this, I\u2019ve begged myself to stop because this isn\u2019t who I am.

That\u2019s only the beginning, we only have sex \u201cat night\u201d because he doesn\u2019t \u201chave sex during the day\u201d we have been together for 6 years, this developed maybe 4 years ago. He masturbates, at work, in his car, while I\u2019m awake he just goes in the restroom and rubs one out. When I complain he says \u201cit\u2019s easier\u201d easier? Easier, than having someone climax you?! Ok, confused. But, here\u2019s the part that gets me, if I catch him... I\u2019ll go INSANE man, nuts. Like crazy hurt feelings, asking a million questions about why he would do that?! This is where he tells me I\u2019m crazy, that it\u2019s normal and I shouldn\u2019t care. But? While I\u2019m AWAKE, and INSIDE the same house? He says I\u2019m immature about masturbation. That he wouldn\u2019t care if I did that, and I explain that i never would. \nHe\u2019s talked to like, I think we are at 8 other women since we\u2019ve been together. But has never \u201cput his dick in them\u201d so he says it\u2019s ok. It\u2019s all be text relationships, bashing me. I\u2019m crazy, I monitor his social media (I have, after the first time i caught him cheating I monitored EVERYTHING... I don\u2019t do this anymore. It just hurts me.) he\u2019s not allowed things because of me, something\u2019s are true others are weird and made up. But it blows my mind the way these girls talk to him KNOWING I exist.

Found stains. (Its how I know he\u2019s jacking off random places.) \nBut here\u2019s the crazy part. He never hits me, he never tells me he love me, never tells me I\u2019m pretty, never tells me I look nice, never hold my hand, never puts his arms around me. But I\u2019ll fight and fight to keep him. He makes sure I know how stupid I am, how lost I\u2019d be without him. But, in turn. I make sure he knows no one would put up with his shit. His lying, his cheating, his lack of affection, his lack of communication... and I have. I\u2019ve stayed through all the shit. \n\nSo, who\u2019s the abuser?! Who is the NSO?! Who is fucked up?!

So I originally posted in the relationship subs, but I was told to post here as well. Still kinda processing all this. So, here's what I posted previously-\n\nAnyways, I left my ex about a year ago. Since then, I've been unsure if I was in a abusive relationship. I haven't thought of it much, until I saw another post that struck me as similar.\n\nWe got introduced when I was 16 through a mutual friend. It was a online relationship, and though we had never met in person at that point, we decided we were a couple. We talked/texted all day, and after enough time started sexting almost daily, eventually moving onto Skype. I feel so stupid for sending photos, but what's done is done.\n\nAfter a couple months, I got plane tickets, and flew across the country to visit him. In hindsight, I'm super lucky nothing bad happened. We mainly stayed in his room, where we watched videos and movies. When we went out, I remember thinking to myself how childish he was. Having butterknife \"fights\" with his brother in restaurants, middle fingers in photos. Even his mom was wondering what I saw in him. Honestly, I don't even remember. I actually actively disliked the guy before my friend suggested there was something more on my ex's end. I think I was more in love with the idea of a relationship\n\nI went back home, continued talking, blah blah. Around now is where I want to point out he had mental health issues. Depression mainly. He talked about how he wanted to join the military so he would get deployed and die. No hobbies other than games(nothing against gamers, I'm one myself, but dude literally only played games). When angry he would punch walls, I would beg him not to when he did. He would sigh and act depressed until I asked what was wrong, where we would proceed to have a full conversation of me comforting him. This happened weekly. He refused to see a therapist, claiming he saw one once and they were worthless.\n\nHe got his first job and quit after like a month.\n\nFor my 17th birthday, I asked him to visit me. God what a mistake. He insisted our beaches suck(something our whole family loves). At one point put a (fake) knife to my sisters throat. We had sex. I have... regrets, about this. A lot of regrets. Just about every day we did. I didn't particularly want to after the first time, but went along with it because I \"wanted to be a good girlfriend\". He insisted no condom, I'm a idiot, but at least knew my cycle and he pulled out.\n\nSo after one night, he and my mom got into a argument, I don't even remember about what. I do know he was in her face, and flaunted about how he had more money than we did(which he insisted didn't happen). In the end, he stormed off and flew back.\n\nAfter that, and at the suggestion of my family, I texted that we should break up. Instead of cutting everything off, I continued to game with him, talk to him. He kept talking about how depressed he was. His brother messaged telling me how bad he felt. Even mutual friends commented on it.\n\nOne night we were talking, he was being depressed, and said he was going to kill himself. He went quiet and I begged and sobbed for him not to. After a moment he replied, and we were a couple again because I feared for him.\n\nAfter that it was the same, but different at the same time. He started talking about houses, and kids. I thought it was hypotheticals, but looking back I think he thought I was going to be a housewife at 17.\n\nThroughout all this he still didn't pick up any jobs or hobbies. Every day was the same conversation, with some depressive stuff mixed in every now and then. Lots of asking if we were okay, and how I was perfect and without me he would die(was spread throughout the whole relationship now that I think about it).\n\nAt one point, I was physically assaulted while trying to defend a family member from a attack. The response I got from him was basically \"That sucks are you okay?\" iirc. From that point, I started wondering what in the hell am I doing. Our relationship continued to decline, and one day I texted him that we were done.\n\nWell, I worded it nicely and told him we could still be friends, and see if things ever pick back up. I slowly stopped talking to him over time, eventually stopping completely. He's now out of my contacts. I still haven't told our mutual friend the whole truth, not sure if I should.\n\nIt was... a little tough writing all that out. It's kinda a blur, and I feel I'm forgetting a ton so please feel free to ask questions.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

And then it was me being a new mom, tired and stressed clearly not thinking straight. \n\nI have anxiety, and he uses that against me. He is constantly telling me that I have issues and need help. Everything we fight about he finds a way to twist it to make my fault. If I mention that I\u2019m not happy or that I don\u2019t feel loved, he gets all offended and finds a way to twist it around so that I end up comforting him.  \n\nHe has double standards for everything. We both commute to work, so if he knows I\u2019m home, he would call and expect me to talk to him while he was driving. But when I try to call him while I\u2019m driving, he is always too busy and doesn\u2019t have time for me. We work different shifts and rarely have the same days off. His days off work are for him to go do things for himself, but when I take a day for myself he tells me I\u2019m lazy and worthless and never get anything done. He tells me I don\u2019t get enough done on my days off, that having my daughter isn\u2019t an excuse, even if I\u2019ve gotten a good amount of housework done. But when he watches her he will literally get nothing done, and play video games all day. \n\nHe will get mad at me if I interrupt him, but he talks over me all the time. He is constantly on his phone or playing video games, ignoring me even when I\u2019m standing there asking him to turn them off and put them away.  \n\nHe will do grand gestures every now and then, flowers, fixing me a fancy dinner, etc., (usually after I tell him how he hardly ever does anything for me) and then throw them back in my face later, saying that I don\u2019t appreciate him or what he does for me. \n\nHe makes promises to me and then breaks them. Told me he would go to church with me every Sunday. Then always has excuses why he can\u2019t go. And has even talked me out of going a lot of times. Tells me he\u2019ll go to family events with me and then backs out at the last minute. Or goes with me and then complains and makes us leave early. \n\nHe goes through my phone, messages and calls. Recently he has been accusing me of cheating on him. He told me I wasn\u2019t allowed to go to a work function because it was just an excuse, that really I had to be cheating on him with a coworker.  \n\nTo top things off, I\u2019m pretty sure he has ptsd from various things in his past and he has hinted that he was abused as a child.  \n\nWe have had long talks before about how I\u2019ve been feeling unloved or ignored or whatever, and he always apologizes and promises to be better and maybe is for a week, and then goes right back to doing the same things.\n\nThere are certain things he does that upset me, and I if tell him that.Then it seems like he does then on purpose just to upset me. Making fun of me, repeating what I say mocking me. Making inappropriate jokes about my family and friends. Being downright condescending when talking. About how my family does certain things. \n\nIt escalated last night, we were fighting and I told him that marrying him was the biggest regret of my life. He told me that if I left he would kill himself. That he wasn\u2019t going to live without me. He was blocking my path and wouldn\u2019t let me leave the house. Kept switching back and forth between nice and terrifying. Promised that he didn\u2019t mean any of it and that he loved me and we could just kiss and make up and everything would be fine, then flip 10 seconds later and threaten to smash my computer or hurt himself or tell everyone what a psycho I was being. It took about 2 hours before he let me leave. Then he called me, apologizing, saying he needed me, come home. When I said no he went back to mean, telling me I was worthless and not to come home without divorce papers. And then back to nice, telling me he just missed his son and that he was having a hard time, then back to blaming me saying I didn\u2019t know when he just needed love and support and that I made everything worse. \n\nI slept at my parents house. He has messaged me a couple times this morning as if nothing happened.  \n\nThings have escalated before to where I have feared for my life, almost every time was when he had been drinking. He always convinced me it was the last time and he was sorry and that he needed me. He would blame me for letting him get out of control, that I needed to monitor his drinking and stop him when he\u2019d had enough. I\u2019ve tried keeping alcohol out of the house but it never lasts. \n\nI\u2019m getting tired of his games. I have my daughter to think of now too. I don\u2019t know what to do next. I still love him. On our good days he is amazing. But our good days have been farther apart lately.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBack to present- that was 3 months ago. Second time I\u2019ve had to stay at my parents to get away from him. Several other times I\u2019ve made it into the car and left, but he always calls and sweet talks me into coming home. \n\nBut a couple days ago was the third time I went to my parents. I blurted out almost immediately that I needed help and needed to get out. Ended up talking for a couple hours with my parents filling them in on everything that has been going on. Id never let on that there was issues this bad before, I\u2019m a very private person. There\u2019s some more serious things I didn\u2019t write out yet. I did tell my parents. And my brother the next day. I\u2019m still processing and have a hard time admitting to myself that they happened. That I let them happen. \n\nI haven\u2019t thought anything through. I haven\u2019t told him I\u2019m leaving yet. He knows I\u2019m staying at my parents for a couple days. Everything has been closed due to the holiday, so I don\u2019t have anything started legally yet. \n\nI\u2019m scared. I\u2019m confused. I feel incredibly stupid and embarrassed having to explain myself to my family after telling them everything I let happen. I have even thought a couple times that I regret saying anything and that I just want to go home and back to my life. My life is about to completely flip flop and I can\u2019t even wrap my head around half of what\u2019s happened. \n\n", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

She always takes up for my sister in every argument and constantly pushes me out. This week I got kicked out of my grandmother's home because of this.

If it doesn't please direct me to the right area. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a year ago late June 2017 i moved out of my parents house. My mom was and is still very negative. shes very much mentally and emotionally abusive but doesn't see it or acknowledges it. TO avoid a lot of her criticisms and nasty remarks i used to lie that i had friends when i was just hanging out with my boyfriend who by the way has been nothing but supportive since the beginning and i'm living with him currently. i also had failed a semester in college because of her and trying to juggle that and a full time job where she used to take a good portion out for bills which is fine but sometimes it was hard to even pay for gas and such when i had no financial help for school and other resources. a good example was i was in credit card debt so i paid it off and she still took what remained from my pay and i was told \"shouldn't have paid it back in full.\"  which sucked a lot. she was also big on gaslighting, and a lot of the time accused me of things i didn't do like currently i supposedly opened my mouth and have caused her to get her pay at work affected when i only talked to an old coworker for 5 minutes and then left with her. i am trying so hard to mend something that is broken and it's hurting me. when i left, i just asked for 3 months of quiet to just be in a better mindset to think and i couldn't get that. i went just three days without talking and that's when she blew up at me recently. \n\nIt's not easy being an only child, since all the attention was on me. with her being miserable i would always be told \"if i didn't wake up tomorrow i would be happy.\" \"if you father died on his way home i wouldn't miss him.\" other death wishes for herself.  what caused me to move was she and him had another fight and she said i'm going to leave your father and  t you'll be motherless what are you going to do? as she went into one of her depressed naps, i filled three trash bags full of what i could and my two ferrets and ran. the thing is i don't regret leaving the situation but with her going after me lately it's again bringing me down and i fear she'll hurt herself and i won't see her again. now i have a lot of examples of the abuse but she always thinks what i did is far worse, but what i feel is so broken and hurt. i just want my mom back, like not this depressed person who refuses to take her meds and such since she refuses to take care of herself. will even go weeks without showering and i feel wrong completely cutting her off... or is that just the broken side of me talking. every time she even messages me nastily, i never respond. i never respond to her anywhere like that. i just feel so sad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsorry for any errors. thank you for listening.

Knowing Im not alone and giving input to others has been really helpful for me. This is going to be a very long post, and for the most part I just want to get my story out there.. \n\nHe brainwashed me. Isolated me from my friends and family. His friends and family constantly had his back, along with spouting bullshit as well... They effectively destroyed my relationship with my family by telling them lies, absolutely stretching what I said. I wish I had kept my family traumas to myself, as much as theyve fucked up as parents, I really missed them and it still isnt the same.\n\nI was manipulated into trying to have a kid with this guy. I told him all about the extent of my childhood abuse and the multiple CSA experiences I had, and he used it as a way to convince me to have kids. A kid to protect these same things from happening to. Im so fucking lucky I turned out to be infertile.\n\nHis sexual desires were insatiable, he never masturbated and would always demand me. Multiple times a day. It was sickening. I was forced even in times where I was completely mute from being numb from his verbal torment. He started hitting me during and I just stopped caring. I would have work early and Id wake up to him groping me, begging him to stop, then when Id ask him why he did that in the morning before leaving for work in tears, he would laugh saying that didnt happen. He didnt remember. No idea what I was talking about!\n\nHe even tried to sabotage my job. I couldnt drive and he would refuse to take me even if I was late at times, I remember running to my night shift one time because he refused to wake up to take me.. (Its not super later, 11pm...) he would sometimes verbally abuse me so badly I was completely distraught, unable to go into work. He would force me to have sex before work. He said I didnt deserve my promotion because I wasnt \"animated\" enough to be at the front. Funnily enough, he would barely work himself and use all my money for tattoos or stuff for himself. He told everyone I made him get Christmas gifts for himself when he got nothing for me.\n\nWe had the same class. He would make me late because he was horribly concerned of how he looked. My parents sold him a car for insanely cheap (I paid for it basically...) so he would be able to take me to work/school. \n\nConvinced me to marry him. I feel so fucking stupid for that especially when at that point he realized I wasnt as easy to control as he thought, and wanted to do it next year instead.. But we still did it and it was the biggest mistake of my life. I mostly did it because I thought it was likely I was pregnant, which makes it even worse...\n\nNothing I did was ever good enough. I wasnt energetic enough. I wouldnt do everything for him when I was constantly working. Im about sharing equal chores and when it came time to do laundry, he would give up after a load or two and leave it in the garage.. Told people at work I couldnt cook when its been my passion since I was a child. I wasnt a person to him. \n\nWhen I couldnt take it anymore and chose living with random people I met online, he was desperately trying to get me to come back. Didnt stop him from taking my last check with half time despite knowing I was homeless because of him! At first he thought I was at my parents and tried to break in. Turns out he was logged into my Google maps the whole time, so when I entered any address I was at (I did, I had to walk places and get back there eventually) the first guy I stayed with told me he had someone knocking after I was gone.. I have a tumblr and he was messaging Every Single person that publicly interacted with me (oh he also hacked it!) Many Ive known for years messaging me about it worried about me.\n\nAll of this haunts me. I was scared he was going to come hurt me for leaving him and now I live on the opposite end of the continent. I wanted him dead, genuinely ruined my life and mental state. I hate that it still affects me now even after getting far away, with a new loving partner, with a kid on the way (unexpected since I was infertile, but Im so happy) I wish I never met this psychotic narcissist. Im so wary of people that exhibit any traits, I never want to experience a nightmare again.\n\nIt gets better. But its so fucked up how the pain sticks. This was just a few months of torment (they pulled me in so fucking fast) and it still hurts a whole year later... ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We broke up almost a year ago and I was a wreck for the longest time. I went MIA from the local social scene but have been venturing forth every now and then because I finally stopped caring and healed almost completely.\n\nI resisted his lovebombing at first but eventually, he hoovered me in and we met up to talk which went well, and he used his manipulative, convincing ways into making me believe he had changed (at least a LITTLE bit) and was working on himself. We met up once more and he gave me a small Christmas gift. During this encounter, I revealed my pain over the past relationship and tried to have a real talk with him about it. I revealed how much I still care. I guess he got his fix of making me look pathetic in front of him and now he basically has vanished. He still responds to my texts with tepidity. We left it off on \"good terms,\" like buddy-buddy-going-to-hang-out and have pending vague plans for the future.\n\nI found myself in the uncomfortable position of waiting around for his texts, etc. I've alluded over text that I was really anxious about being friends again. He's been more receptive than before but I think his manic let-me-play-pretend-feel-empathy phase is over. I finally broke down and texted him \"I think I need space I hope you understand.\" This came after me saying repeatedly how anxious I was about talking again for the past week whenever we would text and him not directly addressing my concerns. \n\nI feel bad, irrationally.

I stayed in a relationship with a man that emotionally and verbally abused me for a few years. \nThere\u2019s a lot of baggage there. A lot of hurt feelings.

I honestly don\u2019t blame my dad too much because his life has been HORRIBLE. I know it\u2019s not an excuse for some of his behavior... but I\u2019ve forgiven and I\u2019ve come to terms with it, so that\u2019s a plus, \nAnyway... the last time I wrote on here, I wrote about not being able to open up to my current boyfriend. The day I wrote it was a bad day... the day before was a bad day... the day after was a bad day... the day after that...

That\u2019s the one thing I\u2019m supposed to be good at... the one thing I should be progressing with... and I sucked that night... it made me feel So worthless. It brought in a lot of self hatred and loathing that I had put away for awhile. It was a bad night. \nI was really quiet, my boyfriend caught on. I didn\u2019t tell him what I was thinking about... but I should\u2019ve. I was thinking about all the pain meds I have in my medicine cupboard... I was thinking about how I could take some with an anti vomiting and anti diarrhea so it would be easier for me to keep in my system. I was thinking about cleaning my room and lighting a candle and taking as many pills as I could. I was going to lay in bed and die. \nI wasn\u2019t going to leave a note.

They made it so I couldn\u2019t do it. \nThe next day (NYE) I felt an immense amount of guilt. I\u2019m so fucking selfish. I fucking hate myself.

Here's the backstory.\n\nMy dad and mom divorced when I was a baby, and I went to live with my dad (I still visted my mom, and we have a great relationship).  He remarried Beth* when I was 5.  She had a son, Bill* who was a little older than me.  When I was 6, my half brother, Ben* was born.  For the first few years things were fine, and I got along with Beth fine, even started calling her mom.  I think she was excited to have a daughter, or maybe just a dress up doll.  Regardless, we got along pretty well for a couple years \n\nEventually, she really started getting extremely controlling and abusive.  Verbally and physically, to both me and Bill.  Bill had some behavior issues and was shipped back and forth between us and his dad fairly often.  Bill and I had issues too.  He was a bully, and took out his aggression on me.  No surprise when neither of your parents seem to want you.\n\nI don't remember Beth ever raising a voice or hand to Ben.  He was the baby. The Golden child.  While She and Ben would nap or play, I would clean.  And clean, and clean.  I was the scapegoat.  I once got whipped with a horse whip for something a cousin did (it was just a small mess - easily cleanable, nothing bad).  \n\nAnyway, she cheated on my dad, so after trying to forgive her for a while, I guess he couldn't and he left her when I was a young teenager. It was the best day of my life.   In the scope of my life, she was in it for only a short period of time - I'm nearly 40 - but she screwed me in the head for my whole life.  As far as I can tell, she ended up to be a decent person for the last decade or more.  She helped people, and what I was able to glean from her Facebook account told me she was empathetic, kind, and actually a bit like me (another mindfuck).\n\nI've been through therapy, which has helped a little, but even before her death, I had mixed feelings for her, especially once I became a mother.  I don't make excuses for her, but I can now recognize her postpartum depression, lack of support, and being overwhelmed.  I know those things well myself, but she taught me how NOT do deal with them.  She taught me all the ways I don't want to parent, so in some twisted fucked up way, she made me a good parent.  Growing up with violence, I feel the urge to lash out in anger a lot, but the memory of her stops me every time.  \n\nAlso, she introduced me to my one of my greatest loves.  Animals.  She wasn't the most caring (I think animals were tools to her), but she taught me how to handle and breed horses, how to raise ducks and chickens, and how to train dogs.  I have a lifelong passion because of her.  I know, I may have found that passion regardless, but I didn't, and I have to be thankful for the good things she did do.  It would be nice if abusive relationships were black and white, right? But even in the worst ones, there are some good things.\n\nSo now to today.  I found out she recently took her own life, and I'm not sure how to feel.  I've been crying, but why?  I hated her!  I also feel guilty because it's not really my place to feel sad for someone I haven't spoken to in almost 2 decades.  That's ridiculous.  But I also wonder if I had reached out to her, to tell her how I felt about her, and if we came to terms somehow, if maybe I could have helped prevent this.  That's also absurd, right? I also hate that I'll never have the chance to tell her how I feel about her, but would I ever have actually done it?  Then I feel happy because she finally realized what she deserved, but Jesus Christ, no one deserves that, especially her surviving family members. That's a completely fucked up thought on my part. Then I feel angry because she has now fucked up her Golden child.  The one kid she hadn't already screwed over in childhood, and she has to go and make him suffer this.  And then I'm sad again.  Mostly for my brother and the rest of her family, but also, for her, and for me.  \n\nI know mixed emotions are normal for deaths, particularly suicides, but I have never felt this conflicted during the grieving process before.  Do I go to the funeral for my brothers' sake, or do I keep my distance since she wasn't my mom and there's been no contact in almost 20 years?  I really didn't expect for her death to affect me like this.  I've thought about it in the past and thought I might actually have a sense of relief, but more than anything, I'm just sad.\n\nTL;DR Abusive ex step mom took her own life recently.  I have mixed emotions, and am questioning the validity of them.  A little stream of consciousness about my current feelings, and wondering how much presence I should have for my brother, who was never abused (as far as I know).", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

But after the conversation(s) it is almost like nothing has changed. He will still talk as though we are going to be together for the foreseeable future - like planning trips away for example. \n\nI can't tell if it's genuine or if it's a tool to keep me from leaving.\n\nJ is no longer permitted to drive my car.   \nHe damaged it by leaving it in an unsafe place overnight after running it out of fuel and something hit it. It has been repaired, although still dented (2 weeks later, he has purchased his own car. Surprise Surprise)\n\nI no longer wear the engagement ring he bought me (and he knows why)\n\nThe circumstances in which we got engaged were bizzare at best and out right manipulative and controlling at worst. It was 2 years ago, and my dad had booked my brother, J and I flights to visit my grandad abroad. To cut a long story short, we argued after missing the original flight and he broke up with me on the plane. We didn't have a conversation about getting back together, but a few days later he was proposing - with a ring. It was romantic, and everything I wanted a proposal to be except how unstable our relationship was. He put me on the spot, and I said yes. I found it embarrassingly awkward explaining to friends and family, especially to those who knew about the break up. I wasn't ready to be engaged then and I am certainly not comfortable with it now.  \nWhen we talked about it, he said that the ring wasn't a symbol of marriage as such, he was to show the world that I'm his girl. While he meant it sweetly, I was pretty outraged by his old fashioned possessive opinions, (although he is fond of sexist and misogynistic jokes, I shouldn't be surprised). \n\nI told him to take my name off of the joint bank account and I no longer want a mortgage with him. It has transpired that in all likelihood he may have forged my signature to set up the account. I will be going in to my local branch to confirm this (as he denies it).\n\nIt's some of the things he said while I tried to end it with him that is concerning me. He wants 50% custody of our daughter which is not something that I am prepared to do. Because J and I were never married, in the UK, I believe he doesn't automatically have that right. He is however on the birth certificate. \n\nAlso, when I asked about dividing up our belongings he said very matter of factly that he owns everything. He might have paid for/been given the majority of it, but in the early years, I contributed a lot, including bills and food. He also ran up \u00a31000 on a credit card in my name which I, myself have since paid off. Not to mention that a lot of the stuff he wouldn't have been able to get as he has a poor credit rating and it was purchased on my finance account (the majority of which he has paid off.) \n\nI am here because I need validation that this is the right thing to do for my daughter and I. It's difficult to keep focused when he is being so normal. He made sure that we had a nice christmas, he says more nice things than mean. There have been no crazy rages. \n\nHis natural instinct is to have banter with me, which used to be fine, but now most of the time I just feel attacked. We drove to visit my mum the other day (28th Dec) and when we got out of the car he started laughing hysterically. I didn't have much patience for it because I knew he was laughing at me (and I rudely asked what the fuck he was laughing at). He didn't like my parking - he even took a picture. And then when I was pissed off at that, he found it funny that I was annoyed. \n\nUsually I like not to take life too seriously, but I guess I'm not finding his company too much fun at the moment. \n\nThanks in advance for any help or comments x \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I was pregnant and it wasn't until AFTER I had our second child that someone in his family reached out to me and clarified what I was suspecting all along. He was cheating/in a relationship with another woman.  \n\nWe do not live together, separated for 9-10 months, and he moved back to his hometown. He was cheating on me with various women during this time and obviously hiding it because, well, how would I ever know since he moved 1k miles away? He was living with his cousin and their family. One day his cousin kicked him out (my nex wasn't working/never works, contributing, being toxic/bothersome to the family, etc.). He had nowhere to go so I speculated he found a new source/woman and doted on her, manipulated her to leave her spouse, get an apartment all so my nex could move in with her and continue doing whatever he wanted to do. He was never going to tell me. Never. All because I was financially supporting him the entire time we were separated. He didn't work. I do. I was caring for our two children (one in utero at that time) and putting money in his pockets to do whatever he wanted with his little girlfriend. I was lied to, told he was putting it together .. but nothing ever came from it. He just kept borrowing money; month after month after month.  \n\nWhen I found out. I immediately called him out on it. Of course vague accusations were NOT going to fly because of course it's easy to deny and lie and just skirt around the conversation, right? So I asked his family member to give me some details, such as, her name and where she worked as well as other information that would be extremely specific and pin him to the wall. I found out the two of them got each other's names tattooed on each other. That was very specific and hard to really contest plus I figured it would throw him off when confronted, completely unexpected for me to know something so detailed as that.  \n\nAnyway, he has NEVER once admitted or even really denied this relationship, living with her, tattoo, etc. He just laughs at me. Well, I should say laughed at me (I've decided to go NC now). Instead he was SO wrapped up in knowing WHO told me. He was losing his mind for over a week trying to get me to tell him! He was using words like loyalty with me and making me feel like a terrible human being, all because I was protecting the individual who told me instead of protecting him for once!  \n\nMy question is -- why won't he ever tell me the truth? Tell me he cheated on me and lives with this chick and the information given to me is TRUE? Why? I haven't given him any money since finding out. I told him I never will give him even a penny for as long as I live. I told him he made his choices and we are done. He ruined everything good we ever had or believed in by his choices and I could never forgive him now. It is over. And I am firm and adamant about my choice to be done and finalize this divorce once and for all. So why won't he just come out and admit it? Wouldn't it be like a win for him if he rubs it in to my face? He has to know it broke my heart so why won't he just tell me? I figured when the gig was up, things started crashing down and I was emotionally broken by everything I learned that to keep on top of the game and feel victorious he'd just come out and tell me how he left me, found this new amazing woman, etc.,etc. Instead he has still never admitted out of his mouth a single confirmation of what I have asked him to tell me. We go in circles; him asking me if I will tell him who told me then me saying, well are you going to tell me who you live with up there and if you have a girlfriend now, etc.  \n\nIt just seems odd to me based on other characteristic behaviors of a narc that he kind of has left this situation very open and unanswered. I expected it to all get thrown in my face. It has not. It is something I know in my heart is so true but just like our marriage and our relationship, it's going to go unanswered as far as what the hell happened. No closure. No decency of just admitting something and allowing me to process it in a way.  \n\nIt sucks but I know what I know and I suppose I need to let it be. I just don't know I fully comprehend why he's chosen to do this with the silence, so to speak and completely ignoring to answer the question.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Asking for a friend.\" - WHEN HE DIDN'T EVEN FOLLOW ME ON INSTAGRAM SO WHY DOES IT MATTER.\n* Would constantly tweet subliminal things that only I would know what he's talking about - looking back this is crazy-making on his end. If I ever brought it up I was told that I was, \"crazy\" and that I was \"stalking.\"\n* Blocked me off everything when I posted pictures of myself graduating from college. \n* In June he lashed out at me after I wanted to get my stuff - he told me, \"you don't get it, I broke up with you for a reason. It was now or later, move on.\" - He never gave me a reason, he dumped me and started talking shit about me - lol okay.\n* Later on that month he lashed out at me again and told me, \"he would prefer to never see me or hear from me again in his life\" and that I was \"delusional and crazy.\" - Blocked my number after this.\n* Told me that he was buying a house just to upset me because he knew that was a goal I wanted to accomplish with him (multiple people have confirmed that he only told me that to fuck with my head).\n* He turned my best friends against me and started befriending them but while we were dating said he \"couldn't stand them\" and my friends \"weren't really my friends.\"\n* I moved to Florida for a summer position to get away from the bullshit - his friends told him that and all he said was, \"good for her.\"\n* While in Florida he started flirting with one of my ex best friends publicly - most likely a tactic to piss me off.\n* While in Florida he took the time to tell a girl he knows I don't like that I don't like her. He said to her, \"I don't want you to get blindsided with drama from someone else.\" While he was the only one knows I didn't like her.

Someone screenshotted it and sent it to him.

My older brother resides on the property as well and has an OCD diagnosis. In the 8 months that we have lived there we have stopped using \"his\" (my brother's bathroom) as it has triggered emotional outbursts due his obsession with cleanliness. \n\nMy bf had been gone for two weeks visiting his family out-of-state and I noticed my brother seemed more laid back and he talked to me more. A few days after my bf returned, we went inside the house to cook some dinner for ourselves. My brother was in the kitchen cleaning some tripe for menudo. His body language changed, he started tapping his foot rapidly and declined to take a break when my mom suggested it as he had \"been on my feet all day\". As my bf and I chatted, my brother left the room, returned and began pacing and breathing heavily. I didn't turn to look at him as I, myself was becoming triggered as our father was emotionally abusive and that behavior reminded me of how he would act. \n\nI had an emotional outburst, crying and telling our mom that it triggered me. I don't think she understands and she told me I haven't wanted to live there since I moved in. I do want to move out as soon as it's financially possible and my bf and I have tried to walk on eggshells in keeping from making a mess. I feel he has only become worse since being diagnosed. He sees a therapist biweekly and refuses medication. \n\nThe following day my mom texted me saying, \"... talked to bro last night, he is being overprotective of you. Let's talk sometime today when the four of us can get together and clear everything. ...\" When I went inside alone to get something to eat, my brother passed by (as he spends most of his down time on the computer in my mom's office) and told me he wasn't upset with me, that I'm the sister he actually likes (we have an older sister whom he hates). I take it to mean that he hates my bf as well. \n\nIs it emotionally abusive that my brother is using his mental health diagnosis to control the family?

A few months ago I started keeping track of things she said and did, and while part of me is certain, still part of me freaks out and thinks, no, can\u2019t be. Obviously this doesn\u2019t represent all that goes on in the relationship. Just the worst of it. Sometimes she\u2019s incredibly sweet and loving, which makes the rest that much worse. \nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nA sample of names she's called me and things she\u2019s said:\nSensitive Sally (and various other feminine names), Ho (Ho-bag, Hoodrat,), Dumb, Dumb ass, Cochino, Dramatic, Drama queen, Asshole, Stupid, Old, Weak, Child, Coward, Selfish, Half-assed, Lazy, Untrustworthy, Trash, Bitch, Elderly, Fuck-up, Shut the fuck up, Fuck you, Poison, Toxic\n\"How can someone so smart be so dumb?\" \u201cLoving you is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d \"You take and take.\" \"You have no passion.\" \"You can't even do the bare minimum.\" \"I can't trust you with anything.\" \"Why do you do this to me?\" \"Nothing matters to you.\" \"You don't do anything.\" \"Why are you even alive?\" \"You're almost 50 and you haven't figured shit out.\" \u201cShut up dumbass.\u201d \"I can't trust you with anything.\"  \"No one loves me.\" \"I wish someone adored me\" (which leads into her saying I don't do this or that, usually things she doesn't do either, or does less than I do).\n\nEngages in small, irritating kind of bully-like behaviors even when I say I don't like it and ask her to stop. For example, sticking her finger in my mouth when I yawn, or poking me or tickling me when I don't want it, laying on top of me like dead weight when I need to move, not moving over when I want to sit down, stuff like that. If I say stop or that I don't want it, she gets petulant and says I never let her do anything. \n\nAccuses me of \"never\" doing something, sometimes just after or *while* I am actually doing it. Has ridiculed, insulted or dismissed: My feelings about my kids (from previous marriage), my family, my religion, my writing, my hobbies, my friends, my cooking, my interests, my musical taste, my taste in books and tv, my views on my ethnicity, political views, my weight, my age. Dismisses my pain as being dramatic. Often mocks my opinions by restating them in a whiny, caricature-type voice. \n\nDenigrates my interests for years and then says I have no passion, that nothing matters to me. Calls me selfish for working out but calls me fat. Seldom cleans, almost never cooks. Asked me if I missed her, then said she never misses people.I once told her I was suicidal and she said I've would get no pity from her. She later used this to criticize me for not making an appointment for a therapist. Says I have no friends because I'm unreliable. Accuses me of torturing her. Smashed the wedding portrait on the ground. Says I have disappointed her for years. Says she's never let me down. Says I try to minimize every problem and weasel out of it. Says I have sucked the life out of her. But also says I am the love of her life, her best friend, favorite person, etc. \n\nFrequently implies I am cheating on her. At times when other people have been disrespectful to me, she says no one is allowed to do that but her. Often does what she wants, THEN asks if I am ok with it. Implies she'll stop doing what she's already done if it bothers me. But...she's already done it. Many double standards especially regarding communication, scheduling. She can basically do whatever whenever with whomever but I have to ok everything with her and usually end up canceling because she wants my attention more. She expects full disclosure from me in all matters but gets irritated if I do much as ask her what her plans for the day are. Questions my love for her if I make a mistake. Equates me doing what she wants with me loving her. Demands constant attention, even when giving me the silent treatment. Shows negligible gratitude for what I've done for her. Acts like I do nothing for her. Routinely criticizes, insults me and raises her voice. But if I bring up a concern, however gently, it's always turned back on me like I created the problem. Blames me for things that aren't my fault. me like a servant. Pays more attention to/has more concern for other people's problems than mine. Regularly criticizes me for doing things she does herself, or not doing things she also does not do. When I brought this up, she said my response is childish.\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Wtf\n\nSo, i think this is the 3rd or 4th time we break up. Last time she broke up with me, i changed the locks to my apartment. She said that if i ever change the locks it was over for real. This time i broke up with her and changed the locks again. \n\nBuilding up to the breakup. 2 weeks ago she got pulled over for driving with a suspended license and i had to come to her rescue, the cop took her ID so she couldn\u2019t really do much.\n\nLast week we kind of spent every day together, it was her birthday on the 28th, we went to the dmv, that took most of the day, then took her to a nice dinner and had a really fun night.

We literally just had sex there and then she started crying after saying that we needed to go. \n\nI guess the guilt of all the cheating was catching up to her. \n\nThe day of her birthday, she told me she was going to Michigan the next day, her friend had just bought her a one way ticket.

She responded saying that i needed to give her a writen breakdown of everything. \n\nI sent her that today and she went crazy, said that that\u2019s not a valid document, that if i wanted to play the game then she charges $10 and hour for cleaning and unpacking my apartment (i never asked her) and then i said, that\u2019s not how it works. \n\nShe then proceeds to tell me that she\u2019ll be writing her own document and taking me to court because she failed her medical program because of me since I\u2019m a psychopath and stalking her and she had to deal with that. \n\nThen she texts me saying \u201cSo I\u2019m curious how many times and one crazy bitch change your locks, You know you have a problem when you have to do that so often, but i warned you\u201d \n\nWarned me?

We are both in our late 20s.\n\nThis week, she told me for the first time she was sexually abused by her father when she was in her very early teens. This happened for months but it stopped eventually. They never talked about it and he never did anything to her after that. I'm the only person that knows about this, other than her therapist, which obviously reported the case.\n\nHer father and her mom have been very close to us. I feel terrible for her to have carried this by herself for such a long time (almost 20 years). Even though I felt like he lacked a few boundaries with people in general, I never suspected of any abuse. Her family environment always seemed stable to me (though I only met them a decade after it all happened). I also feel terrible I never noticed it by myself.\n\nShe wants to cut ties with her father and I fully support her decision. We are both adults and we live far from her parents, which should make this simpler to do. However, we are concerned about how her mom would take this once/if she knows about it. We are also concerned about her mom's financial situation given that she doesn't earn as much as he does. Her mom doesn't have a lot of close friends and tends to rely on her father for her social interactions.\n\nI'm posting here to ask for advice on how I can do my best to support her overcome this. I've never had to deal with a situation like this one and I would be thankful for any links you believe would be helpful. Suggestions on how to handle family relationships in CSA cases like this one would be helpful as well.\n\nThank you.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

So, here's my piece.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why do Narcissists and Co-Dependents Attract Each Other?**\n\n*Simple Answer:* Narcissists and Co-dependents give each other exactly what the other wants - they each are who the other wishes they were.\n\n*Long Answer:* One thing that needs to be understood about narcissists and co-dependents is that they are both incredibly good at reading people, in their own special ways. Co-dependents are incredibly sensitive to people who radiate negative emotions - the downhearted, the emotionally distant, and the people with low self-esteem. In other words, co-dependents are good at detecting the very emotions that fill the core of a narcissist behind all the emotional walls and ego-feeding successes. Co-dependents are very good at reading people like this, drawing them out of their shells, and doing everything in their power to try and make their negative feelings subside.\n\nOn the other hand, narcissists are phenomenal at reading the opposite emotions. They are good at picking out the people who radiate positivity - the people who shower those around them with gratifying admiration, unconditional support, and frequent forgiveness. Narcissists love admiration and unconditional support, as well as people who forgive freely as they are more likely to put up with the narcissistic abuse for longer. So, this is why narcissists and co-dependents attract each other. They both have these specific voids that they can fill for each other.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition, another way of thinking about this is that both narcissists and co-dependents are who the other wishes they could be. Behind codependence is a lack of confidence and self-sustenance, which we mistake the narcissist to have in the beginning through romanticizing their egotism and self-centeredness. Behind every narcissist is a lack of warmth and empathy, two qualities that codependents appear to have in spades. They literally complete each other like two pieces of a puzzle perfectly snapping together... on paper.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Why It Doesn't Work**\n\n*Simple Answer:* Narcissists and co-dependents can only get their high when the other is at their low.\n\n*Long Answer:* So, if these two types of people are just absolutely perfect for each other on paper, why do these relationships always seem to fall apart in the end? The problem with narcissists is that they love being showered in affection and praise... until they don't. Eventually they get bored of the unending supply and want something new. This is why being in a relationship with a narcissist can feel like a whirlwind of highs and lows. Because, from one minute to the next, the co-dependent is either smoothly drawing the narcissist in or forcefully pushing them away with the *exact same behavior!* Once the narcissist has been pushed away, the co-dependent enters their low period because they don't understand what went wrong.\n\nHowever, a narcissist's satisfaction with praise is only ever temporary. They will always eventually enter their low period of hungering for praise and admiration again and this is when they come back apologizing and begging for attention again, which is *exactly what the co-dependent wants to do!* Thus the cycle repeats, over and over and over again. Do you see what's wrong with this picture? It's dysfunctional - two dysfunctional roles making up one very dysfunctional relationship. One partner can literally only ever fulfill their duty when the other partner is dissatisfied with the relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**What to do?**\n\nI cannot provide an easy answer for narcissists because I fell into the role of a co-dependent. Although, I suppose the ultimate fix would benefit both narcs and co-d's. Simply put, learn to actually love and cherish yourself. Both narcissists and co-dependents seem to find themselves in the other person. This only leads to unhappiness. Nobody wants to be your god and making someone your god is too mentally and emotionally exhausting to carry on for forever - whether your partner is a narcissist or not! So, learn to self-sustain. Get into your hobbies again. Find ways to make your job interesting. Make close friends who truly genuinely care about you as much as you care about them. In terms of relationships, get with someone who doesn't need the constant validation. Try to shoot for your relationship being, not two half-people finding their other half, but two complete people joining together to take on the world together!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhether it takes a simple change in perspective or decades of regular therapy, the fix is, simply put: learn to be content with yourself and make sure that the people you care for put as close to an equal amount of effort into caring for *you* as possible. If you have friends or an SO who clearly doesn't, back off and find someone better. Life is too damn short for 90/10 relationships where you're putting in the 90...\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: I saw a comment earlier - must have gotten removed. But it made me want to post this disclaimer: PLEASE DO NOT think that this essay is meant in any way to encourage victims of abuse, toxicity, and neglect to \"see their abusers side of things\" or anything like that. Hell, I literally say in my last paragraph, find someone better! I am NC with my Nex, I've seen her reveal her true ugly face in our last conversation, and I would never look back! If you're in the same situation, get the hell out because it is so incredibly unlikely to get better that you may as well say it just won't! However, I am an advocate for the idea that we as victims should not only see these abusers as the spawn of Satan. At the core of their behavior is a brittle ego and incredibly low self-esteem. Oftentimes, too, people with this disorder suffered some sort of trauma that triggered it. In my case, I had two who were molested and endured some pretty nasty things when they were children - one was neglected as a freakin infant! Is that an excuse to be a shitty human being? No! But is it a horrible thing I would never wish on anyone? Yes! Check yourselves and read rule 3 on the sidebar - focus on healing. You aren't going to heal if you tell yourself these people are all inherently evil scum who deserve to die and burn in hell. I am a co-dependent - I would have loved nothing more than to take the numbness, the lack of self-awareness, and the unwavering fear of abandonment away from her. I told her I wouldn't leave until she pushed me away and I owned up to that 110%! But, when I realized the truth behind her behavior, I felt pity. Not enough to give her another try. But, seriously...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the very least, we're trying to tell ourselves we're better than these people. Are we really if we just equate them to scum of the earth without a second thought? I was shaken to my core in my abusive relationship and yet I'd hate to live in your head if you have that little compassion for people with serious mental conditions. These people are literally destroying the world around them and don't know why. They're already living in their own personal hells and that's punishment enough.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Quick story; I once offered to take him to the airport in my car at 7 am, I let him drive but he ended up crashing as he was pulling out of the parking lot. He totaled my car, but the worst part was that he asked me to take the blame because he was under the influence of Xanax and liquor (which I did not know when I let him drive). I took the blame, told the cop I did it and within 5 minutes- his uber pulled up and he was back in New York in 5 hours, he never even helped me pay for the ticket (even told his mom I was a crazy bitch when I reached out to her about it).

Should I try to leave??? I'm 16 now", "author": "cheezit_lover", "self_text": "This is going to be really long. Sorry lol\n\nThrough out all of my life I've been terrified of my mother. When I was very young, I still looked up to her and loved her, and she treated me like how most parents do. She would hit me when she got mad or I did something wrong, but she wasn't as cruel and hostile towards me yet. She hadn't had a mother kid yet, and it was just me and her because my father wasn't around. We lived with my grandmother and my older cousin for a while when I was toddler, and everything I remember was very happy. When we moved out of my grandma's, we were something you might see in the movies or something because we were always around each other, and I was basically a mini her. I've always been a really good child and I'll get into that later, but I never had any reason to get yelled at. And ofcourse I did get in trouble for little things, but never anything big and never frequently. When I did get in trouble it was for something small  and looking back most of it was probably over exaggerated on her part, and sometimes she would get mad at me for things that were outside of my control. But like I said I was fine and happy, and so was my mother. And even though looking back things were normal I was still scared of her (I thought this was normal and okay) And I've always knew she was someone to walk on egg shells around..\n\nLet me give you a little back story on my family and my mother. She grew up with both parents in her life (they weren't together), and she has 3 siblings total. She spent a lot of time with her grandparents (as I do with mine). From what I can see her parents both somewhat like her. They both are traditional, homophobic, and typical old black people. My grandmother is a loving grandmother, and I mainly get a long with her, but when she does get angry it's not pretty, and she complains and nags a lot, but it doesn't bother me too much because I've dealt with my mother who's much worse. My grandfather is unemotional and stern. He laughs and he has a emotions, but his personality is just very close minded and one tracked, and he doesn't stop to be empathetic towards others. He doesn't seem like he was the most loving and nurturing parent towards my mother and her siblings growing up. My mother tells me about how he wasn't a very good father and didn't do things for her that she wanted. For example she wanted to go to a catholic high school and my grandfather refused to pay for it. He has a wife that has always been very mean to my mother (and no I don't consider her my grandmother because I've exchanged less that 20 words with her my entire life). She still really doesn't like her now, and my mother avoids her at all costs. My mother also says that her sister (from my grandmother) was a very awful and would threaten her, but I don't see it being super significant. And my aunt had a child when my mother was in like middle school and my grandmother pretty much raised her for her entire life, and she's lived with her up until a few months ago when she moved out. I'm not sure if that will be significant later on, but  it might be. I'm telling you all this because I think it might give you some insight on why my mother is the way that she is. \n\nNow my mother had me when she was 20 years old, and my father has never really been in my life much, but that hasn't really affected me at all because I can't really miss something that I never had. She's a social worker (this is going to be shocking later on), and she's in her mid 30s now, so she's fairly young. She's also really homophobic and ignorant even when it comes to black issues. My family is fairly poor, and my mother  always had to work multiple jobs to support us (she has one other child that's younger than me). She's sent me to private school almost all my life and I only go to public school now and the second half of 9th grade. \n\nNow let's get into the things that she does to me. One time, she had been laid off from her job, and we were leaving the unemployment office. I was around 6 or 7 at the time btw, and we were in the car pulling out of the parking lot, and she's driving and I think she was like looking for something in the car (probably documents I think.) And just so you're fully aware of the situation, she was obviously struggling for money, but I remember we had food to eat, so it couldn't have been that bad. But anyway she's looking for something, and she's frustrated and angry- as always. And without warning she just hits me in my face and busts my lip open. This was the first time I was really angry with her about the way she treated me. This was only one of very many times she would physically harm me without good reason with me being a bit older (6-9). I can't remember too many times in great specifics, but she would grab me by my collar and yell in my face, push me, hit me ofc, pinch me, punch me, etc. And I know this isn't anything major or abnormal, but she would do this to such an extrem point where it last for several minutes at the most. And I know that she would do it to make me cry and be begging he to stop. And this gets me into another small thing. She engrained in me that crying was something that you're supposed to get in trouble for. If i would cry after she hit and/or yell, \"what are you crying for?!?!? Why are your crying, I didn't hit you that hard\". And I knew that of I was ever caught crying from being upset I would get in trouble. \n\nShe didn't really verbally abuse me as much when I was younger, but i remember one time in particular, I dripped some water on the floor and she yelled something along the lines of, \"STOP, you stupid whore\", and I was really confused as to why she would say that to me when I was just 9 or so years old. She on the regular would say things like, \"I can't stand you\", but for the most part it was just yelling. She would constantly (and she still does) yell at me for things I had no control over. She would also do that to make me cry and to belittle me \n\nSomething that she would also do was make up things to yell at me about, and then take things away from me. One time it was Christmas and my grandfather had got me a \nDSI XL, and she knew I was so excited to open it and it was something that I had really wanted. But when we got home she started yelling and was angry with me, and said I couldn't open my DS, a and she opened it in front of me to make me upset, all while she had this sadistic smile on face. Another time she had made mac and cheese, which she knows I love. But just as I was going to eat, she started yelling, and made us go to our rooms, and we weren't allowed to eat dinner that night, no matter how many times I begged and pleaded. This happened lots of other times too, and I just didn't understand what I had did wrong, and why I couldn't just eat. But sometimes she would yell at me before or while I was eating, and ofcourse her goal was to break me down and make me cry, and I wouldn't want to eat anymore because i was so upset, but then she'd force me to eat and yell at me even more to the point where I was bawling my eyes out over a plate of food while stuffing food into my mouth. \n\nAs I got older, I started to get smarter and venture out to lean things on my own. And I started to learn about child abuse and I realized that she was a very abusive parent, and I had to find a way to deal with her. I learned that your abuser wants to break you and make you cry, so you shouldn't give them the power of seeing you cry. So when she would do things, i would work on not crying, and I tried to stand up to her, but that only made things worse. \n\nShe became a lot more hostile and viscous towards me in more recent years. When I was in 6th grade i was reading all the Harry Potter books at school, and one day we were in the car and I was reading the prisoner of azkaban. The book of course was really thick, and it was really torn and falling apart. So I'm reading in the backseat of the car, and we're on the way to my grandmother's house, and she's yelling about something, and she's really angry, and I'm trying to calm her down- as usual. But all of a sudden she rips this book out of my hand and throws it on the on the floor to take it away from me. I was so upset because she was causing so much more damage to the book, and it wasn't mine, and I didn't want to bring it back to school in even worse condition because that's just extremely inconsiderate. Another time very similar, I was going to a sleepover, and earlier that day me and my little sister were fighting, and she decided to tell my mother that I had tried to do something to her or something like that, so my mother was really angry and going off at us, but she still forced me to go to this sleep over knowing that I was no longer in a good mood since she had yelled at and hit me. She had also probably taken my electronics away or something. So on our way to the hotel, she's screaming and yelling at me, and I'm just exhausted and worn out from her berating me all night, and I know we had actually deserved it because we were arguing or whatever, but I couldn't help but be depleted from that. But anyway, something causes her to start going through my bag and she then throws my sketchbook that I had bought out the window because she said it was too lame to bring to a sleepover. She then forced me to go pick it up as she's yelling at me in the driveway/parking lot kind of area of this hotel. And while I'm running in front of the car with tears in my eyes she's repeatedly stepping on the acceleration pedal to threaten running me over, but I knew she probably wasn't going to. Stuff like this happened/happens all the time day, probably at least once a month. \n\nNow, the past year of my life has been the hardest because so much has happened, and  things have been really really hard in the years in between, but the last year has been worst of all. The first thing that kind of set things off was me transferring to a white catholic school that was really strict and not very diverse, and before I was at a private school (7th-12th grade) that was very diverse, chill, and accepting, so I was very sad to have to leave, but the tuition there was too expensive. One day, a little after my 15th bday (late oct-ealry nov). We were in the car going to school, and she's chewing me out about how terrible I am, and I'm not sure what triggered it, but it wasn't just a normal situation of her yelling because it turned into a pretty bad arguement, and I couldn't help it and she broke me, and I started crying. And ofcourse she yelled at me for crying. But this day was the first time I ever really confronted her about how she treats me, and ofcourse she took that really bad because she doesn't like to admit what she does wrong. Bow the thing about the arguments that we have, is that she'll twist my words to have more of an excuse to yell, she'll lie and say that I do the things she does to me, she'll make excuses for what the way that she acts by saying that I don't do enough around the house, and I don't appreciate what she does for us and blah, blah, blah. But she also does this really weird crazy manipulative thing where she'll just start saying the craziest most untrue things to make me upset, and she won't let me explain myself at all because she'll be screaming and yelling so loudly (usually telling me to shut up because what I'm saying is true and she doesn't want to face the truth of how she behaves), and I mean LOUD, crazy screaming. She'll sound like an animal, and just start going crazy (it's really hard to explain how she acts), but this will usually end her hitting me, storming out of the house, or in this case kicking me out of the car, and making me walk the rest of the way to my school. I was just so angry and infuriated I can even explain it. I was just so sick of her treating me this way day in and day out. Always yelling and complaining about every little thing, and it feels as though I can never do anything right for her. Regardless of what I do she will find a way to give me hell for something. So I'm just crying on the side of the road just out of my mind, and I was really debating walking in the street to be hit by a car because it's just so hard to deal with her shit everyday, and it just takes a toll on my entire self. Her anger gets in the way of everything I try to do, and it's an every day thing. And that day my older cousins picked me up from school early because my mother had told her what happened and she felt sorry for me. \n\nNow I'm going to describe some of the things that she does on a daily basis. She's extremely hostile to me in the way that talks. If I try to talk to her I'm greeted with a very angry response. She's always angry and upset, and she's like a ticking time bomb and I'm always waiting for her to explode again. For example just now, I told her that I've had a really bad migraine for a few days now (I've had chronic migraines for the past 3 years now, and yes, I've seen a doctor and I've been in and out of the hospital countless times). And she started whining and complaining that sue was going to have to take me to the ER again, but then I said never mind and that I was fine because I didn't want to deal with her right now, but she of course insisted on me going and got angry because I changed my mind. And so I told her that I didn't wanna go anymore because she's getting upset with me. And for the millionth time we had to go back and forth because she insisted that she wasn't upset and that in lying because I'm saying something that's untrue. And I say that she's upset because she clearly displays an unpleasant emotion, and the way the she's talking to me is hostile and aggressive. Then she told me to get out of her face and she didn't want to talk. I think I mentioned this before, but when she gets angry, she'll start yelling at me to get out of her face and to leave her alone. This also happens when I ask for something. For another example, I don't have any pencils for school, and I had been asking her to get me some all break because I don't have a way of getting to the store or any extra money. But everytime I ask her she gets mad, and tells me to get out of her face. She's always screaming at me about she doesn't care, and I can just go without food, or a ride from work, or in this case pencils. She says she doesn't care and she doesnt, but she wants to control every little thing in my life. Like I'm not allowed to stay up after 9 doing my homework, and she catches me up she'll start interrogating me on why it's not done and when I'll be done. \n\nBut the biggest thing that's happened was when I liked this girl (I really regret it now because it was so spontaneous, and I'm ugly, so ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Telling this story from my new point of view feels as good as it did to finally get rid of my NEx\u2019s final gift to me.]\n\nMy NEx dumped me 2 years ago. On my birthday. I was devastated at the time because I hadn\u2019t realized that he was an N. \n\nWell, if I\u2019m honest I recognized some N traits but he hadn\u2019t sicced his N side on me in the 4 years we were together and besides I was so besotted with him I didn\u2019t let myself fully recognize for example how he ignored and scapegoated his son and put his golden child daughter on a pedestal. I felt completely safe with him. He listened to me, was compassionate, empathized, validated and supported me emotionally, and I did the same for him. We had had similar abusive childhoods and we both often said how grateful we were to have a strong mutually supportive, emotionally intelligent bond with each other, a bond  that we didn\u2019t have with anyone else. I held his hand and let him cry on my shoulder when his son didn\u2019t call him on Fathers Day or his birthday. \n\nThen he fell in love with another woman. Our relationship was open so this normally shouldn\u2019t have been a threat. Initially he told me he wanted us both in his life and that while he connected well with his new partner he didn\u2019t have the same emotionally supportive bond with her that he and I shared. I told him I was happy he was happy in his new relationship. I also was honest and said while I knew he still loved me I was feeling a bit \u201cless than,\u201d in large part because I\u2019d been the scapegoat in my family growing up. He already knew about this and had always been supportive about it. He understood, didn\u2019t try to gaslight me, and asked what I needed to feel loved and supported. I said I needed his reassurance that I was still loved and valued, both verbally and through action, such as telling me he cared and making time for quality time with me. He agreed to do this. In open relationships it\u2019s conventional wisdom to make sure existing partners feel supported when someone has a new partner. \n\nBut he didn\u2019t. He took the vulnerability I\u2019d trusted him with and turned it against me. He said the right words but didn\u2019t follow through with action. He spent nearly all of his time with the new woman and didn\u2019t communicate with me unless I initiated it. The rare times he and I got together he was distant and acted like he didn\u2019t want to be there. \n\nHis birthday came around and he spent the weekend before and the weekend after with her. He made a weeknight overnight date with me in between so I could celebrate with him also. At the last minute he changed it to dinner only, claiming he had \u201can early meeting.\u201d I put on a brave face and accepted this (stupid me). I told him I understood he wanted to spend a lot of time with his new partner but I asserted my need for time with him too. I said I missed him. He responded \u201cI don\u2019t miss you as much as you miss me.\u201d Ouch. I should have walked away right then but I let myself believe he was so wrapped up in new relationship glow he didn\u2019t know what he was saying. What a fool I was.\n\nA few weeks later he did include me in a community picnic event where I\u2019d meet his new partner and her kids for the first time. I was looking forward to meeting her. The event was crowded and very noisy. I\u2019m an introvert and my NEx had always been supportive when we were in similar crowded noisy situations, checking in with me often to make sure I felt safe. Not this time. After I\u2019d spent some time making amicable small talk with the new partner I got overwhelmed by the crowd noise. I excused myself and went off to a quiet part of the picnic area for a time out. My NEx walked over to me. I thought he was there to support me like he used to but instead he yelled at me for \u201clooking miserable\u201d and said I was \u201cacting childish\u201d and \u201csulking.\u201d I had officially become his new scapegoat. \n\nMy birthday came around after about a month later. I was unavoidably out of town on the day but we planned a weekend date to celebrate my birthday when I got back. Again he changed it last minute from overnight to just dinner.\n\nAt the restaurant he gave me my birthday present, three aromatherapy candles labeled \u201chappiness\u201d and \u201clove\u201d and another positive thing that I can\u2019t remember. He said he wanted me to be happy, then said that since I was so unhappy about his new relationship it was best that we ended ours. Just like that. \n\nI had mixed feelings - in spite of the way he\u2019d changed toward me I still felt very connected to him but OTOH I was miserable over being pushed away and tired of being scapegoated while he put the new woman on a pedestal, even though all the while he told me he loved me and wanted to maintain our relationship. I wasn\u2019t unhappy that he had fallen in love with a new person, I was unhappy because of the way he treated me when that happened. I said I understood he wanted out and that I was sad to see what had been such a beautiful relationship end. He said \u201cI\u2019m not sad. I\u2019m very happy with [New Partner].\u201d Way to kick me when I was down. And over my birthday dinner at that. \n\nIt took me a long time to sort through all the pain, sadness, and anger. I was mostly angry with myself for overlooking his N-ness until he turned it full force on me. I see him now for the abusive narcissist he is and am getting on with pursuing new relationships. Mutual friends who watched all this go down sympathize with me and confirm what an asshole he was. I\u2019m no longer in contact with him. \n\nBut those damn aromatherapy candles. Love and Happiness and Whatever. They stayed in my hall closet for 2 years. I didn\u2019t want to use them and be reminded of that awful birthday and all that led up to it but I also didn\u2019t want to turn my back on the positive messages they represented. I dithered over this until yesterday when I said \u201cscrew it\u201d and took them out of the house and put them in the trunk of my car. My plan was to drop the candles off in a Goodwill donation box but this morning when I parked at work I took them out of the car and threw them in the trash. \n\nIt felt freaking fantastic. \n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It was a time of bliss and happiness, being told he knew I was the one and that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. He told me all his exes had cheated on him and he had trust issues, so I agreed to share my location with him and let him have fingerprint access to my phone. Even after that he would get paranoid if I didn't respond immediately and accused me of cheating. When I would hold his phone he would get extremely paranoid and protective, and finally one day I went through it. I saw messages of him talking to guys and they were telling him of all the things they wanted to do to him. Then he forgot to log out of Facebook messenger one day and I found even more guys and one guy saying \"lets take this to gmail\". I went to gmail and found that they had exchanged nudes. I kept looking and there were multiple other emails from guys on Craigslist where he was saying the things he wanted to do to them and sending nudes and organizing meetups.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI confronted him about it and he said he could explain. That our sex life had died off (he rejected me sexually for months and called me sex-crazed when it would make me upset) and he spoke with those other guys for us. That he felt confident when he spoke to them and that he did it to make our sex life better because for him maybe if he felt confident again we could have sex again. He told me I was overreacting because he never actually found those guys attractive, he was just doing it for himself. He said he had recognized it was a mistake and meant to delete it and never tell me again. So I decided to forgive him and move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward and one night after he starts being an asshole while drunk I stand up to him and tell him I wont be spoken to like that and he assaults me. He throws me around the house and chokes me on the floor, punches me in the jaw, and takes pictures of me lying on the floor beaten so that he can show me the next day \"how fucking pathetic you are\". When I tried to leave he broke down and said he wanted to die and ran into the kitchen holding a knife against his wrist and heart until I begged him to please put it down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe has written me a letter since I left and started no contact saying how sorry he is. That he recognizes why I had to leave and that I never deserved that and that he hopes I'm doing okay. He's reached out to friends and said it was all his fault and started therapy even. This is just all so hard to wrap my head around. What gets me the most is the images of him cheating or him hooking up with guys now to get over me. I feel like it wasnt a confidence issue, he just got a thrill out of seeing and chatting with other guys. He made me feel guilty for him for so long. I have nightmares every night of him having sex with other people or with those guys he cheated on me with even though he said he never met them and I picture myself sitting at home wondering why he seems so busy tonight and what's going on. I sometimes just sit and sob thinking about him having sex with those other guys and having hookups to get back at me or get over me.

I'm slowly realising that it was in fact an emotionally abusive relationship and that my ex may have been a narcissist. \n\nLooking back, I can't believe that I was so blind and didn't trust my gut for three whole years. I can't believe I let someone else treat me so badly and that I just couldn't see what was happening, while it was happening to me. The thing is that the things I will explain down below didn't happen exclusively or all at the same time. They happened slowly, and after fights we would always make up and my ex would say or do something nice again. I think I clung to the need for someone else to love me so badly, that I accepted how he treated me, in the hope that it would someday get better. Well, it never did. So here goes...\n\nWhen we first met, my ex (let's call him A) pursued me. A was incredibly charming. Our first months together were a whirlwind. He showered me with affection and lots of gifts. He would send me sweet messages every day, and we soon went on our first romantic city trip together. I trusted him and shared secrets with him that I had never told anybody else. He was there for me when I had bouts of depression and panic attacks, and I was there for him when he had a complicated situation in his family that took a huge emotional toll on him. I thought everything was going great and that we were both really happy together. \n\nThe first red flags soon started to emerge, but I brushed them aside because I thought that everything else was going so well. The first red flag (that I didn't take seriously enough back then) was that everything went way too fast. He told me that he loved me after only knowing me for about three weeks. I remember telling him \"you don't even know me, so how can you know that you love me?\", but he insisted that he had incredibly strong feelings for me and that he could see a future for us including marriage, children and the whole shabang. He also pushed to have sex really soon. \n\nThe second red flag was that when we talked about our past relationships he said that he had always thought that his last partner was fat and ugly and that they had a really big fight when they broke up. We had arguments about this, because I told him that of course he didn't think these things about his ex partner, else he wouldn't have been with her, and that if she was fat then what was I, as I was actually heavier than his ex. Huge red flag, I know that now!\n\nUnfortunately I brushed these red flags aside and we moved in together a year into our relationship. That's when things started going south. He stopped being as interested in me as before and he stopped having an interest in sex. He said that I was gaining weight and was becoming unattractive, although I was the same weight as when we first met. He stopped wanting to hold my hand or kiss in public. When I finished my studies he wasn't happy for me, instead he complained that my studies got in the way of us spending time together and that I didn't know what hard work was anyway, because I only worked part-time whilst studying. When I got a great job opportunity he again complained that my work was getting in the way of us spending time together, although I was working just as many hours as he was. \n\nHe started bad-talking my friends, saying that most of my friends were strange and judging me for hanging out with them, and that I was spending too much time with one particular friend. At the same time he would constantly say that I had no friends and that it really bothered him that I was such an introvert while he was such a social butterfly. When my friends met up with me and A, I often found myself making excuses to my friends by telling them: \"he's different when we're alone together\". \n\nHe was strangely obsessed with money. Nothing was ever good enough for him if it wasn't the best or most expensive. Because he didn't earn very much, he took out loans to buy expensive things. I always paid for groceries because he hated going grocery shopping, and I paid most of our holidays and bills. He was really focussed on the fact that my family had a little more money than his family, and towards the end of our relationship he would often say that I had always had it so much easier in my life than him, and would basically shame me because my family had more money than him. In reality, he just couldn't deal with finances at all and was immune to advice or help. He would often talk about plans of us buying an expensive car or a house together. Thank god it didn't happen. \n\nWhen we talked about our past experiences he told me about how he had a lot of experience, going into detail about what sexual adventures he had been on. I consider myself sex positive, so I listened to his stories with interest and told him about my experiences which were much fewer, and that when I was single I generally just liked to kiss people but seldomly went further than that. To this he replied that he thought it was shitty of me to lead men on by \"just\" kissing them. When I tried to explain to him that it was up to me to decide how far I was willing to go and that I didn't think this was problematic at all, he simply didn't get it. \n\nTowards the end of our relationship he also turned out to be (surprise!) a misogynist. We had a huge argument when he said that it was basically a women's own fault if she was harassed or worse, if she wore clothes that were too revealing or basically walked alone in the wrong part of town. I could have vomited when he said that. We had huge fights about this, and he pretended to change his mind about these things after I explained to him the myriad of reasons for why this is bullshit. \n\nWhat he said really hurt me because earlier on in our relationship I had opened up to A about a bad sexual experience I had when I was younger, where someone took advantage of me. Back when I told him he was really understanding and supportive. Towards the end of our relationship he told me that it was my fault that it happened and that he thought I was a terrible person for how it played out. \n\nOf course, he also turned out to be a giant liar.  At the end of our three year relationship I found out that he had been having an affair with a coworker of his. I knew something was going on, but he made me feel like I was insane for thinking these things. So I took a look at his phone. I know it was wrong, but I felt like I was going crazy and I'm glad I did it, because it allowed me to take the step to leave him. He was also sexting multiple women and had different kinds of dating apps installed on his phone.\n\nAlthough he had also been unhappy towards the end of our relationship, all hell broke loose when I broke up with him. First he was sad and begged me not to leave him. He told me, sobbing, that he wanted to have children with me and that he would do anything to fix this. He told me he would kill himself, because he had nothing left to live for. Then he became horrible and sent me messages containing the worst insults that anybody has ever said to me. Really awful stuff. He sent pictures of him holding a (fake) weapon in front of a picture of us to my friends. He threatened to send my parents private naked pictures that I had sent him (upon his request), and to tell them secrets that I had told him back when I trusted him. I called his bluff and then blocked him absolutely everywhere. I moved out of our apartment, got a new apartment and didn't tell him or anyone he knows my address. \n\nI am still getting over this breakup. In the beginning I felt like I was at rock bottom. I felt like I was worthless and unlovable. But with the help of therapy I'm slowly getting better. I'm so glad that I got out of that relationship before we had children or bought a house together. And on new years eve, watching the fireworks from my balcony alone, I realised that for the first time in a long time I finally felt free. Like I could breathe again.

We were a really close group and I truly felt close to each one of them. At the start of 2017 I moved into my own flat and got depressed and while I saw them less frequently, I was still in regular contact with them. Then, this guy comes along and I end up seeing them maybe 4 times over our whole one and a half year relationship. He beat me the two times I had been on nights out with them because I had come home late etc and promised that the next time would mean a black eye so I simply never saw them again. I felt like I couldn't tell anyone and that my friends wouldn't even believe me.\n\nTo put into context how shitty he was (and what kind of impression my friends have of him and by extension by me the few times we all hung out and saw us as a couple): he made lots of nazi references/jokes, threw bottles from the my flat window on the street at us, shouted racist abuse at a stranger in the street... Yeah, they must have thought I was crazy to be spending time with him and not with them. One of my closest friends actually told me she thought *I* was some kind of nazi out of associating with him and cut me off, which was... nice. While I have since established with the rest of the group they know I'm not that way, I haven't told them that I wasn't \"allowed\" to see them for a year. I missed out on a lot of things in their life that I feel so bad for but I can't go back.\n\nI want to reconnect with them, but I don't know if it's even appropriate to explain *why* I cut them off.

They shattered into fine dust and I stood over them triumphantly. The lens he created for me was crushed beneath my feet. It is done. And I am stating my intent to be done asking questions that I know are only according to the web of lies he created for me. From here on out, I am stating my intent to CHOOSE to believe and accept the TRUTH, especially when it feels like a lie.\n\nWith scissors, I shredded the sweatshirt he gave me; then with my family I threw the shreds into our campfire and watched them burn. I knew what was really burning... it was the mantle of shame, terror and worthlessness that he placed on my shoulders. That burden was never mine to carry. Perhaps it was never his to carry either, but now it doesn't really matter.\n\nYes, it still hurts. Yes, in the height of cognitive dissonance I still feel like I might have lost my best friend and the love of my life. But I know that's a lie; his words never bore up under scrutiny, and they never failed to disappoint.\n\nThe lie was that he was my soulmate; a brave, wise, kind man of integrity who was standing up against an oppressive regime and wanted me to stand with him against it. The truth is that he was a predatory, con artist rapist and likely murderer who escaped his country so he could portray himself as a victim of his oppressive country and more easily prey on his victims. The truth is that he cares so little about the rest of his people under that regime that he did everything he could to sabotage my advocacy efforts to help them, because he'd rather have me destroyed than help his people gain freedom. The truth is that he continues to prey on well-meaning people for their money, because they think it's going to help those under the regime when in reality it's used to snare and entrap his victims. The truth is that somehow, a person like this was able to worm his way into my inner circle and earn my trust and respect, and that of my friends and family. Yes, it's harder to accept the truth. I'd almost rather blame myself for all of it, because the truth is almost too insane and terrifying to believe or accept. But it's what happened, and I have to accept it.\n\nHe openly mocked me for the idea of me killing myself over him breaking my heart. There is no doubt in my mind that he would have been thrilled if I had killed myself; and he would have been equally satisfied if he had the opportunity to do it himself, like he threatened to do. If he couldn't control me, he had to destroy me. It's in his wiring... for now at least. But the fact is, as much as he is a liar, he's a coward. He knows he can't kill people here and get away with it, like in his home country.\n\nBut he failed to achieve my total destruction. Here I am, alive and breathing, enclosed by my amazing, protective family and friends. Yes I'm crushed, but I'm not destroyed. He doesn't realize that what he did to me will only make me stronger.\n\nHe doesn't realize that I am the inverse of him. There was one similarity between us, after all: we both possessed the ability to walk through hell and build ourselves back up again. But here is the difference. When he is destroyed, he is built back up each time to wreak more and more havoc and destruction. When I am destroyed, I am built up each time to give more and more life.\n\nTo all of you who are going through hell... walk fast. We'll make it through all right.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I used to often feel sympathy for him knowing his history during childhood and past relationships. I have come to realize that his ex was not \u201ccrazy\u201d as he told me she was. She was suffering like I am. I blamed myself every time something wasn\u2019t right because he was so good at shifting everything and making everything my fault. There was much psychological abuse and I\u2019ve lost much of who I am. But he is not the beginning and doesn\u2019t deserve all of the credit. It started with my first husband and I didn\u2019t realize he was also a narcissist until I started researching exactly what one was. Strangely it wasn\u2019t \u201cnarcissistic\u201d that I googled. It was \u201cno empathy, doesn\u2019t care, distant, indifferent\u201d and similar terms to try to figure out what was going on. I had no idea until the results kept revealing the same trait. Narcissism. As I delved further into it I discovered that my current boyfriend is the covert kind. My first husband was the overt kind. I blamed myself and still do for allowing it to happen a second time. I always believed that we show people how to treat us. I\u2019m educated. I should know better. But I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t. I took it all from my boyfriend. And I always apologized. I did whatever I needed to do to try and smooth things over and make him happy. I even gave him money when he decided to go back to school. I paid my mortgage and his, taking on extra jobs...and he took and took. Occasionally I\u2019d get a glimmer that he loved me. But there was always a strange undertone for which I couldn\u2019t explain. There was never any discussions between us about anything serious. I could not discuss how something hurt me even when he secretly took pictures of a female without her permission. He refused to listen. Wouldn\u2019t talk. Watched TV or was on his phone while I talked. His behaviour was disturbing and he was never at fault. Ever. \nRight now I am trying to break free and do no contact.  I was somewhat successful up until today. He already did the gaslighting and now we are at the hoovering stage and guess what? I fell for it. He sent a text. Asking how to fix it. What I needed to do (and I\u2019m very serious). As I was writing out my reply text I kept telling myself not to reply, I even thought that maybe I was wrong about him...maybe he did love me and wants to make it work. There were so many conflicts going on in my head as I wrote my reply. I should\u2019ve listened to my gut and logical side. Instead my text consisted of explaining, apologizing, explaining some more. I went so far as to tell him how his distance and ignoring hurt me...and guess what happened?? He stopped replying when he got all my emotions poured out. I\u2019m pretty sure now in hindsight that he was satisfied knowing that he was still in the drivers seat. I feel very stupid and my plan is to not reply further if he tries to reach out again.

This sub has been a source of elucidation, strength, and resolve over the past month and a half while I\u2019ve dealt with a slow, painful discard. \n\nI wanted to write this out and share my story in case others find these kinds of reflections as helpful as I do. \n\nSo, here goes.\n\nThis past summer, I bumped into my \u201cfirst love\u201d, a guy I fell hard and fast for when I was 14. We lived in separate cities, but managed to connect for a couple of summers physically and through the fall/winter months through ICQ (wow, does that ever date me)!\n\nHe was pretty much my first everything. Two years older than me, gorgeous, confident, and charismatic. He made me feel like I was his everything, until the summers ended and he moved on to other girls. After the second autumn of heartbreak, I decided that it was enough- I couldn\u2019t bear going through it all again. So I gave up the pursuit and focused on myself. Ended up dating a guy from high school. We\u2019ve been together for 16 years, married for 7- pretty much high school sweethearts.\n\nOver the last couple of years, my husband and I have gone through a couple of rough patches. I found out last year that he had been seeking out NSA hookups. He swears he never actually did anything, but. Who knows. Still, I stood by him, as I believe in the sanctity of marriage.\n\nOr, so I thought, until bumping into my ex. He saw me at a parade, waved hello. I stupidly added him to IG afterwards and we chatted on and off, lightheartedly, until we ran into each other again about a month later.\n\nI can\u2019t describe the feeling I got when I saw him again. He made (and if I\u2019m being honest- still makes) my heart beat faster, my tummy flip, and my mind race. Still as beautiful as the day I met him. \n\nWe crossed paths by a lighthouse, and walked, and walked, and walked. We were having such a great conversation- just catching up and getting lost in the excitement of being in each other\u2019s presence. We ended up walking to the beach, and sat lakeside under the stars. Ah, the romance.\n\nOf course, nothing happened. As we\u2019re both married with children.\n\nHowever, after this, our DMs became much more intimate. The love-bombing began. He started sending songs suggesting that I was his \u201ctrue love\u201d. I was \u201cgorgeous\u201d, and he wanted to spend time with me. \n\nHe texted constantly. Every morning I could count on a good morning message... or two, or three. I have to admit, it felt amazing to feel appreciated and lusted after, especially by the mythical fish that I could never catch when I was a love-drunk teenager. \n\nHe seemed so smitten. There was such adoration!\n\nBut then... the silent treatment. A good 3-5 days. of. nothing. When he returned, it was like he hadn\u2019t disappeared at all. \n\nAnother 2-3 weeks of daily conversations, intense flirting, and I\u2019m ashamed to say it, racy photos (mostly of him- he knows he\u2019s a looker), silence. Again. This time for a whole week.\n\nI didn\u2019t chase. I didn\u2019t question. I felt angry, confused, depressed, and frustrated, but I tried to keep my head. He doesn\u2019t owe me a thing, I thought- we\u2019re both married. \n\nBut now, after being introduced to the concept of NPD, and processing everything that happened (including ALLLL the way back to twenty years ago) it all makes sense. Textbook narcissist following the textbook script.\n\nLove-bomb- Devalue - Discard.\n\nI still have my diaries from when I was 15. It\u2019s unnerving to read some of the entries... \u201che loves me, he loves me not, he loves me, he loves me not\u201d. \u201cAs soon as I get over him, he re-enters my life\u201d. \u201cHe makes me feel so shitty- why do I like him so much?\u201d\n\nThis time around, he \u201cpunished\u201d me with the silent treatment. He constantly bitched about his ex. Complained about his wife and his miserable day-to-day grind. Even said he wanted to \u201cend it\u201d one night. I immediately sought helpline numbers in his area, told him I was there if he needed me, and was genuinely concerned for his safety. 10 minutes later he flipped it around and started mocking me for trying to help. Said he had never suggested wanting to kill himself. Kinda stupid when the text messages were right there proving otherwise... but, alas. \n\nHe said he\u2019d go silent because of his depression and that he couldn\u2019t even get out of bed. Yet, there he was, posting stories and clearly interacting and liking/conversing with other (mostly hot gym girls) on IG.\n\nAnd I hated feeling so needy. Like, why did I even care what he was up to on Social Media?? I\u2019m not his wife! And what the hell was I thinking? I\u2019m a wife myself!\n\nSo, after about 3 months of ever-increasing passive aggressive statements, non-committal/broken plans, and  intermittent silent treatments, I had had enough. I blocked him on IG. Took him two days to reach out, and he simply said, \u201cwell, it\u2019s been a real pleasure\u201d. Like, really? Said that I was the one who ghosted, and that it felt the same as indifference. Funny thing is, I didn\u2019t even know what ghosting was until I started talking to him again. \n\nI tried to explain my feelings (stupid mistake), and he ended up leaving me on read.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a month now, and it all just feels so surreal. \n\nLooking back, there were obvious red flags that I should have noticed:\n\n- when we were walking, after so many years- he told me about how his \u201ccrazy\u201d ex ALMOST convinced him he was abusive. But in reality, it was all her. Mmmhmmm, right.\n\n- he said he felt like a \u201csociopath\u201d and a \u201cblack hole\u201d\n\n- sent pretty callous/sexist memes that seemed totally juxtaposed to the love bombing he was doing.\n\n- not really caring about or listening to my problems. If I mentioned them,  he\u2019d just try to one-up them. \n\n- asked him to describe himself in one word. He said, \u201cexhibition\u201d\ud83d\ude44\n\n-would get annoyed by seemingly innocuous things. Super sensitive to perceived slights. \n\nAnyways. It\u2019s over now. The first few weeks (especially the first) after he stopped talking were bloody hard. \nSo many tears. So many sleepless nights. So many questions. So many dashed hopes that he\u2019d reach out.\n\nAnd here I am, still scratching my head at it all. Despite the gentle sadness that remains in my heart, I feel a hell of a lot stronger than I felt a month ago. \n\nI\u2019m not a dumb person, but I feel duped. I almost ruined my entire life for that same stupid boy from twenty years ago.\n\nEgh. Fuck Narcs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I left that personal hell (or rather was fortunately abandoned) a couple of years ago. A lot has changed in my life since then and I am luckily in a very healthy and happy place now. Yet I am left with this aching, lasting regret.\n\nThere is a constant pang of fear and resentment, like a door left slightly ajar. You want desperately to shut that freaking door but it is stuck in its perpetual schrodinger state. It has left me with this awful sense of unease and contempt. Why didn't I press charges?\n\nNow the shitbag is newly engaged (again, for the fourth or fifth time in his life) and is continuing to perpetuate his filthy abusive habits. He in no way deserves to be happy. I could have stopped all of this. I could have put the bastard behind bars, but I was/am too much of a coward. Now he is left to continue his reign of terror, and his unwitting new victim is none the wiser. What's worse, and what is ridiculous for me to care about, is all of the preposterous lies he is telling her about his most recent crazy ex. He did that with me, as I am sure he did with her, and the one before her, ad nauseum. Ever the victim, never the abuser. Always the gaslighter.\n\nI still have the occasional nightmare years later. I have constant unexpected triggers. Can't watch certain scenes in TV shows or movies. Don't like being blocked in or cornered. Constantly willing to blame myself for the most minor of issues. Have permanent scars on my body from the beatings. And here is this giant, punchable-faced fuck, walking around with sunshine and rainbows coming out of his ass like he's the second coming of Jesus.\n\nI want to finally be done with him and the bad memories. I keep hoping he has moved away, and that the last shared friend we have will finally see the light and dispose of this waste of air. It sucks to know that there is a residual link between us.\n\nIf there is one piece of advice that I can give, it's this: listen to your gut. I saw red flags almost immediately, but I willingly turned a blind eye. I had known this person for a number of years before dating him. I thought being a family friend made him safe and trustworthy. There were so many warning signs I ignored that are glaringly obvious now. I should have trusted my gut, and I should have stood up for myself.\n\nGet out early. Walk away and never look back. It isn't worth the regrets or the time lost.\n\nMy only real consolation in all of this is knowing this person has a congenital disorder that is almost guaranteed infertility. All I can hope is that this one part of his life that he can't control will make him as miserable as he made me. I dodged a massive bullet, and I am thankful every day that his teeny weenie doesn't work. In fact, I may have just cracked the code into all of his anger and insexurity issues.

So the guy and Rose broke up and she confided in me. She mentioned she noticed him and my NEX got super close after the break up. Fast forward to last night, Rose confided in me again that the guy is still messaging her trying to get back with her. She asked him why he\u2019s always with my NEX and he said they\u2019re only hanging out along with his friends and cousin. Rose sent me a screen shot of the guy showing Rose a portion of his chat with my NEX where she was telling him to be patient and that he needs to earn back Rose\u2019s trust.   \n\n\nShe\u2019s playing confidant and relationship advisor. In my head I was like \u201cB*tch you mean like how you made me wait, ignored me for weeks until you feel like contacting me? how you told me to be patient because I was rushing even tho our relationship was going nowhere? You say \u201cEarn trust back\u201d...when I gave my all to you but you betrayed me with no remorse? \n\n\nNow she\u2019s being \u201cfriendly\u201d with someone who has introduced her to his friends and cousin. He has done a lot of favours for her. He even knew about her financial situation (he told Rose about it and Rose told me). I was surprised because she never liked talking about her personal life especially not to people she\u2019s not close with. They would sit in voice chat playing games with each other a lot but when she was still with me, she always told me she doesn\u2019t have time and didn\u2019t want me to call. She never even told her friends we were dating. \n\n\nI can see the pattern. I know what\u2019s going on. This is the new supply.  She made a beeline for this guy who was popular and was well-off. She\u2019s suddenly doing things she never really had any interest in solely because this guy likes doing it. \n\n\nIt stings. Here I am still hurt and mourning but she\u2019s actually already found someone to sink her claws in.

What a perfect match right? She gets her wealth and popularity, guy gets to lewd. \n\n\nBut it still stings. I know and I\u2019ve kept telling myself that I did my best. That her being happy with someone else doesn\u2019t mean I was lacking. Knowing that she\u2019s with someone else this soon just drives home the fact that our time spent together meant nothing for her. That all my tears, all the suffering I endured meant nothing to her. The fact that I\u2019m still hurting is because the relationship actually meant something to me but it\u2019s entirely meaningless to her. My mind can\u2019t stop ruminating, still trying to make sense what and who she is. She was a different person when she was with me. She\u2019s a different person now with him.

And he's tired and doesn't want that. \"No-one else treats me like this.\"\n\nSo inevitably I'll contact him asking whats up. Are we talking or not? He will counteract with \"wow, all you do is talk shit about me\" aaaand, discard. After a few days of hell and constantly \"making things worse\" when I don't have the option to make this better. And I'll just think, \"WHY did I have to say that? I KNEW how he would react. I KNOW the rules.\"\n\nThis shit killed me. I remember one day I was at work, and I just started crying and had to leave the office. I'll sit on my hands to not message him, tell myself repeatedly \"if I message him, he's leaving\", give in, argument, beg, plead, discard. Rinse. And. Repeat. Pretty much daily by this point.\n\nI don't know, I guess I just couldn't follow the rules. Either positivity, on his terms, being good, not bringing up \"shit\".

In the good times he really did seem to care. His friends that he's told everything to about physically abusing me (I checked. He told them about how he hit me and choked me and punched me) all say that he's feeling so guilty and never doubt that he actually loved me. It just doesn't make sense in my head. How am I supposed to believe he loved me when I felt rejected and hurt so often and that he didn't listen? Then I remember the \"good\" time and I think no, he really did love you. Then I think of times that I stood up to him. I even slapped him once when he was screaming at me and holding my mouth closed. I feel like I was abusive too and a shitty boyfriend. I was really insecure at times, especially once he started rejecting me sexually, and other times I'd get really jealous if I saw him giving other guys attention (even though this was after I had found out he was cheating). I haven't been able to find a therapist because of the holidays and it's been three weeks now, but apparently he's been seeing a counselor for anger management (what he's calling his issues). I feel like I'm kind of slipping into a psychological breakdown where I want to self harm, but then the next minute I feel relieved and then the next minute I'm standing in the shower screaming and crying and it all feels like so much.

Yesterday I (28F) had a realization that I grew up in an emotionally abusive household. \n\nThis was a strange realization because I've always had a strained relationship with my dad (63M), and knew things were emotionally volatile, but ultimately give a pass because him and my mom (52F) religious people and have good intentions and tried to do what's right.\n\nI also am married, own a house, have a puppy, generally have had stable jobs, etc. and did well in school (valedictorian). I feel like it somehow excuses the behavior, i.e. The end justifies the means because I turned out fine. If we don't count mental health that is.\n\nThis last year I've realized a number of patterns in relationships, friendships, and difficulties with groups/social situations. I tend to abuse alcohol somewhat to get through these situations and it has lead to some poor choices on my part. I'm in a therapy program now and very much felt like I didn't deserve to be there when I started, like other people have serious problems that are the result of other people doing something to them, whereas I felt my problems are my own doing.\n\nWell. When a therapist looks at you and speaks on behalf of 6 other therapists and says, 'Many of the things you described in your relationship with your father are, indeed, emotional abuse,' it kind of changes things. I still feel responsible for fixing my life but I feel so... Relieved not to have to carry this overwhelming guilt that all the problems in my life are all my fault.\n\nI didn't even know emotional abuse was a thing. And when I researched it all, I felt that I had experienced so much of it. Constantly having my feelings ignored or invalidated, love or physical affection being withheld, walking on eggshells to avoid being yelled at. \n\nI understand my dad grew up in a difficult house and likely didn't know anything different. Hell, I'm worried I'm the same way with my own partner. But is that enough justification to be compassionate? As part of therapy I need to meet with my family next week. I know I likely should bring this up, but I don't know what I'm going to accomplish. I'm an adult now, and I moved out as soon as I became one to get out of that environment. My relationship with my family is shallow. Part of that is on purpose because I don't want to associate with people who make me feel bad about myself (I guess because they continue to subtly emotionally abuse me??). I don't relate to them and feel like it's my responsibility to suppress all my emotions and try to manage the conversation so we can stay civil at family dinners.\n\nSo... Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Did you discuss it with them? What was the outcome? I guess I'm curious if you guys just went straight for the jugular ('yo dad, the way you treated us was emotional abuse and I'm fucked up') or a more sensitive approach ('sup peeps, our volatile household had negative life impacts for me). And if you chose one or the other approach, would you have changed anything?\n\nPart of me just wants to continue this shallow relationship and not get into it. I'm worried if I bring it up they'll convince me I'm being dramatic and feel horribly offended that I don't appreciate the gifts, time they've given me over the years. Part of me wonders if I'm the emotional abuser. I'm just hoping some of you would share your experiences and help me know what some possible outcomes could be. It feels too little too late imho.\n\nOne last thing, as for the effects currently...\n-low self esteem\n-mistrust of authority figures and constant fear in in trouble or did something wrong\n-difficulty believing someone could love me unconditionally / believing love is conditional\n-virtually no relationship with brother (30M) as he went through a very rough patch and I think I held him fully responsible (not recognizing until, oh, yesterday that it's possible that was just a boy, a child, who suffered the same abuse I did)\n-desire to move away so I don't need to feel guilt about not visiting/seeing them\n-constant sense of guilt or shame\n-unreasonably secretive\n-constant need for validation from men\n\nThank you everyone in advance... I'm looking forward to breaking out of this cycle.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Before she left she did the Narc thing and dumped as much of her toxicity into me that she could. I went through it all; love bombing, devaluing, gas-lighting, the discard, and more.  The thing is she has spent her life learning to cope with her Narc toxicity. This is a process for them and they repeat it over and over to get through their miserable lives. However we are not accustomed to carrying around all of that toxic bullshit day in and day out. So when they leave, you really are in the worst kind of way because of what they dumped into you and you really can't see it ever changing. I'm here to tell you that it does change and it's something you must look forward too. You gotta cut all ties with them and allow the toxic bullshit to slowly leave. It's a slow process and you will almost stop it from happening if you don't cut all ties. And here's what you need to understand. After it starts to leave you'll notice it and you'll be amazed at how good it feels. You'll swing back and forth with feeling good and bad but eventually you'll have far more good days than bad and the good days starts to be the norm. And then one day, you'll find yourself in the emotional state where none of their crap is in you and you feel so grateful for returning to how you used to feel. The thing is, it's better than you have ever felt. You're at peace, you're happy, you're calm, and you don't need anything from anyone. You just appreciate the simple and amazing little things that life has to offer. And the best part is you're have no tolerance for anyone taking this peace from you. I guess what I want to say to all of you that are in the very dark stages of this is that when you make it back you will feel better than you ever have in your entire life. These Narcs have nothing to offer us so cut em out of your life and don't look back. Time will heal your wounds and you'll will be stronger and happier from all this. And that makes experiencing this whole nightmare worth it. I know you can't imagine this but it's true.

He raged, left without me and began text insulting me about how selfish I was how I am not a \"good wife\" etc. I had to take my mothers car to his familys house and was not even 30 minutes behind him. When I got there though, he was pleasant acting..cracking jokes and opening gifts with his parents. He acted as if the rage NEVER happened. His family does nothing but laugh at everything he says and does/ thinks he is just magnificent; meanwhile I sat there flushed..confused, tired with a fake smile on (per usual) outwardly ignoring the slew of text insults I received minutes before. Every day until new years came and went almost exactly like this. If I was not faking the funk by his side or with his family I paid the price for it. It was basically a week of traveling and holding in tears and I simply cannot do it anymore.  \n\nAs I have mentioned before, when I get the chance to exit this marriage I will be doing so.

The way Debra (main character) described how nice and how successful he claimed to be, when in reality he was clearly had NPD and was a pathological liar/drug addict, was honestly like hearing my own life repeated to me. And the whole notion around \"too good to be true\" was what made me start digging into my narc's life and relationship as well. The podcast made me super suspicious and in the end I was completely right. He was a pathological liar (almost nothing he ever told me was true including his job, living situation, family life, etc) as well as having textbook NPD characteristics (gaslighting, exaggerated sense of self, etc). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow that the podcast has become a show and that time of my life is a few months past me, I find myself watching it and getting insane anxiety. As all Narc situations don't typically end well, mine was no exception. I was stalked and harassed, and had to file a police report which seemed to end all contact, finally. But watching Dirty John has made me think of all the things he could still do, maybe he's plotting, maybe he's going to try to get revenge one day. And I know the obvious solution would be to just not watch these shows but I'm not the type of person to just ignore things I don't like. Or become one of those \"trigger\" people who can't see certain things lest their anxiety or pain get the better of them. I am someone who has been a victim of sexual assault, but seeing or hearing these things on TV don't bother me in the same way at all. I also come across articles regarding Dirty John (the show and real life situation) and the comments are always people talking about how stupid Debra is, how could she go back, how could she do this to her family. And I have a really hard time with those kinds of comments. Is that how people view me? I actually once saw a reddit topic that was titled \"was Dirty John a true crime story, or a story of a dumb woman?\" Watching the show reminds me of how TRULY AWFUL things could have actually turned out. But also seeing people so harshly judge is really tough. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother show that also bothers me sometimes is the show You on Netflix. If you haven't seen it, in a nutshell, it's about a mid 20's psychopath who stalks a girl and becomes obsessive with her. Watching that also made me extremely uncomfortable as he stalks her SOOOOOO easily based on the info available to him on the internet, which we all know today is impossible to avoid. I've taken steps, made all my social media private and barely post, but I still worry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do you guys cope with things like this?\n\nTL;DR: I find myself getting major anxiety watching shows that portray men being violent or stalking women.

Nothing related to my personality at least. He complimented my physical appearance fairly often (but also seemed to get irritated whenever my past sexual history came up in any way), but he never spoke of me the way that others always do. People usually tell me that I'm really friendly, genuine, smart, hardworking, creative, easy to talk to. Guys always tell me that I'm a good catch and that they're surprised I'm single.\n\nHe never said any of those things about me. Almost felt like he looked down on me a little bit - if I showed any weaknesses I felt like I could almost hear a smirk come through his voice. He told me that his friend had found my Instagram (where I post my photography and drawings). I asked him what his friend thought of me, he said his friend thought I was \"okay.\" He implied that his friend made fun of me and that he thought it was funny. He told me that he didn't look at my account though, because he felt like it wasn't a good way to get to know someone.\n\nHis female friends were allowed to do anything they wanted. They could hook up with guys, party, whatever and he always took a non-judgmental stance. His other supply was \"a lot of fun.\" So much fun that he was going to take her to his work holiday party.\n\nMeanwhile he was pressuring me for commitment, even cried when I tried to end things one night after he told me that he cuddles his friends \"platonically.\"\n\nAt the end it was just pure insults. I was emotionally abusive, manipulative, weird, way too into him, less important to him than his friends. I was nothing. I tried to stand up for myself and told him that he only knew maybe 30% of who I actually am and referenced my interest in making art, and then he told me that he had seen my Instagram account. I guess at some point he was curious enough to want to check it out himself, but he didn't tell me he looked, because he didn't want me to know.\n\nHe never wanted me to know my strengths. It hurts that he tried to hurt me so much all while lying to my face and most likely cheating on me emotionally. I don't know why someone would ever want another person to feel this way, especially someone who they are trying to spend so much time with. Everyone else in his life got free passes, at least in his presentation of facts to me, although he occasionally called them \"crazy\" here and there. He's still out there, doing his thing, most likely dating the other supply now, and I'm left holding all of the garbage that he dumped on me. I never judged him or put him down, although there were enough things in his life to warrant many raised eyebrows. I just didn't think it was my place and I cared about him. He even said that he didn't think I would ever do anything to intentionally hurt him. He was right. But meanwhile he was doing everything he could to make me feel lesser. He wanted me under his thumb and smiled slyly when he saw how upset I was after telling me about the other supply.\n\nIt was all so cruel and I feel a little sick to my stomach when I realize that I was intimate with someone who was filled with malice for me. My mind wanders and I wonder if he would treat other people this way too or if he reserved it just for me. I don't know. I guess it doesn't matter. I just want to be rid of this. I don't want to believe the things that he made me feel anymore, I want to rise above it, but I don't know how to shed myself of it. I'm still tied to the outcome - I don't want him to be happy.

I used to think she just had quirks, like we all do, and it was easy to explain it all away. What I think was happening, for the most part, was that we agreed on most things so the 'monster' didn't come out until recently. We disagreed, she went ahead with what should have been a joint decision, and then instead of being glad I had acquiesced she turned the abuse up to 11; belittling me in front of friends, contradicting everything I said, criticizing my hobbies and interests, giving zero emotional support (career concerns, bereavements etc), threatening divorce then suicide, the list goes on.\n\nI've recently read that narcissists need control, so it's not enough to get her way - she needs to beat me down in her twisted view. I get that now. I think the hardest part of the last year was not understanding what was happening and doubting myself. Maybe I should have done this or that. If I could just be someone else, I wouldn't have the feelings she doesn't like! The more I've understood, the more bizarre it gets. After picking on me for making an innocent comment under my breath, she actually said \"I like to mess with you.... in small ways\".

Instead I was met with bragging about her previous sexual encounters and how easy it was for her to find dates. My hobbies she either hated or mocked, directly or indirectly by making a silly sound effect (\"ha\" or something like that). I was spending tons of money on her going to expensive restaurants and trips out of town. Any time I told her no to these things or was anything less than completely supportive she would become angry and sometimes downright nasty, even if what she was asking for was completely unrealistic. I was kicked out of her apartment if I ever expressed any unhappiness and I think a few times just randomly. She'd blame me for stating my needs and acted like that was the problem and that I was just never happy. Ironically, every thing i did for her was met with extreme criticism and she'd either redo it or take over and do it herself. I was doing the chores, paying for everything, running errands for her etc. I received nothing in return and the love and emotional support i gave was taken advantage of.  She said she wished i died, accused me of having sex with my sister, my boss, of wanting any girl period. I was isolated this way from friends and family and all of my attention was for her and only her. And even giving her what she wanted, the abuse didn't end. Every decision was questioned, every feeling invalidated. Sex was withheld and sometimes she'd respond with facial expressions showing extreme disgust at any attempt. Sometimes I wouldn't even be trying for sex and she'd push me away... like rejecting me although nothing i did had been at all sexual in nature and I don't believe it came across that way. Gaslighting was common. I've caught her in countless lies, especially regarding men. This is the first year of the relationship or so.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the first year, I've began doing the discarding and falling prey to the repeated hoovering and taking her back. At this point I feel like the bad person because I keep taking her back and kicking her out of my life repeatedly. Inconsistency like this is abuse on my part i think. But she promises always to be a better person and to change. 3 months ago this was promised and i returned to her to be IMMEDIATELY abused... she made many many demands and then when i went to pick up food for us she texted me a death threat. I think on this occasion it was blatantly apparent that she meant nothing that she'd just said. And that she meant to destroy me and punish me for having left. The remarkable thing is that she WILL say she is sorry and even make some really small gestures to make up for things... but they seem meaningless when she's still getting everything she wants and those things are so pointless. The confrontations have become physical on more than one occasion, with her ALWAYS being the aggressor. The reason I left 3 months ago, FYI, was because I received a raise at work and she lost her mind and blew up at me saying i didn't deserve it and I'm a piece of crap and she deserved so much more because she works hard and always has etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**However**, things have evolved. She's adapted and no longer attacks me physically. And only after a touchy discussion will she take shots at me and they are relatively minor. Rarely she will at random but it's subtle and easily played off. Things are so much better now that there are hard boundaries in place.. that if she crosses one means the end of us. However, the manipulation is still there. She made several insults about the home I'm buying (after I'd put the offer in and signed the contract..) and she sent me many alternatives or told me how to update the home to make it better. She was pretty obvious about pushing me to make it a home SHE would want and would be proud of because she expects it to be ours (hers) in the future despite me just taking her back and telling her i need to see, over a span of time, her willingness to do better before I'd make any further commitments to her. And she's been very pushy about moving in with me etc. The emotional connection doesn't seem to exist from her and it's really just become incredibly subtle manipulation still and everything is somehow beneficial to her and she always gets her way... like \"Good Morning, will you do such and such favor for me\" to start the day rather than i love you or being sweet and just talking or something. My life feels like I'm here to give her what she wants. But the abuse has subsided to the point that it's definitely bearable and it's mostly just constantly her pushing her agenda. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thing is this... I've developed c-ptsd and I can be triggered from movies, television, something she says or does, and sometimes out of the blue flashbacks. I can't move past the previous abuse and seeing her using me or playing me now just makes it harder. But despite all this, I can't stop believing the illusion that she can get better. She goes to therapy for the first time today and it gives me false hope. Part of me knows this is just who she is and that the only reason she isn't trying to destroy me is because she knows that'd mean the end of the supply. I feel so guilty because I now blow up in rage and bring up stuff from the past and reference the present and tell her I'm unhappy and she's still doing stuff that makes me uncomfortable etc. I know that getting angry or throwing stuff from the past in her face repeatedly is unfair and abusive. So, you see that I'm conflicted... I feel abused, but have begun sharing in that abuse to where it's mutual. And I see her use this against me as well. She is more controlled now, subtle, and manipulative. Every now and then she'll crazy make and test me. I still see the red flags. Everything points to her being that same person and I know deep down the SECOND I commit I'm going to be shredded. But I do care for her... though I can't for the life of me see why. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat is your advice? Obviously stop getting triggered. Most likely leave because she doesn't make me better, regardless of diagnosis? I'm already in therapy and the therapist doesn't TELL me to leave but heavily implies it is in my best interest and is the only way I'll ever get better. Does she sound like she has NPD? BPD? Does it sound that severe? Am i now out of touch with reality and no longer see how abusive and awful the relationship is? It all feels normal now. Like I'm okay with mediocrity. That I accept her entitled, selfish behavior and the lack of emotion in the relationship, as long as there isn't any obvious abuse. Am I brainwashed and being slowly bled out here? I guess I'm just looking for some form of validation. Someone to validate my experience; to tell me my anger was justified and that I need to gtfo. But if that's not true, if this relationship is salvageable, then I'd rather save it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Just like how they say that being abused physically will often result in you becoming abusive as well? I know that to some extent it is true, because lots of pedophiles turn out to have been raped themselves. Of course that doesn't excuse their actions at all but it makes me worry. How often does this actually happen? I've had a terrible childhood with all forms of abuse and I used to have a temper. When I was 8-12, I used to be really violent and often hit classmates or my brother or even just brick walls. There was a lot of anger in me because of the abuse I went through, which isn't an excuse I know, but I often couldn't contain that anger and exploded. If there were people around then, they'd get hurt with words and my fists. At that time I didn't care. I feel incredibly guilty whenever I think back about that because I can't undo it or apologize to the people I hurt. Some were kids younger than myself. At that time I was also addicted to whatever shit I could find in the house which was probably partly the cause for my violence. I'm 24 now and I've been clean of drugs for 4 years and sober for almost 2. I haven't been violent since I was 18 and only turned the anger onto myself, which isn't good either but better than hurting innocent people (or children, God forbid!). My question is whether I'll eventually become violent again or get worse? Am I doomed to turn into the people that hurt me?\n\nBecause of my violent time in know that there's truth to the popular quote of the abused becoming the abuser. What I'm most afraid of is the worse abuse I've endured which was sexual. How big is the chance that I'll have such a disgusting phase as well? Is there a way to know whether or not you'll turn into a pedophile? Does that start with sexual desires for children or is it must there one day? Much like how you are angry first and then punch. Or is it more like a sudden no-warning kind of thing like how sometimes people punch suddenly without warning, without first being angry for some time? I have no sexual desire for children whatsoever, nor do I have sexual dreams or fantasies about them. All it does is disgust me so I'm safe. But am I safe forever or just for now? Will I turn into a monster eventually? Maybe it only takes time? I think that some people of my family are also afraid of that possibility because I'm never left alone with a child. And when I'm playing with one, then I can see my family stare at me like I'm already a predator. I know that men playing with children is often looked at with suspicion but it still hurts, you know.. I love kids in the innocent way and would even want some myself but I'm just too scared to actually let myself dream of parenthood. Because what if I did that to my own kid? What if I'm changing a diaper one day and suddenly there's this switch in my head... Am I right to be afraid like this or am I overreacting?\n\nThis shit is what I'm most terrified of.

For example, if someone lied in the workplace, I believed that the liar would eventually feel so awful about what they had done that they would confess or atone for the lie, or someone would find out that they lied and would hold them accountable. I believed in this overarching sense of justice, fairness, and balance. I relied on it; I trusted in it. \n\nI have seen enough now to know that this simply isn't the case. People do horrible things all the time with zero repercussions. They harm people and get away with it. They can ruin another person's life with lies and not lose a wink of sleep over it. They just keep on going. \n\nNarcissists, of course, are the biggest perpetrators of this type of behavior. They can destroy someone completely, and not feel an ounce of guilt over it. Their only concern is \"*can* I\", not \"*should* I\". And realizing this has changed my perspective completely. \n\nOnce you realize that narcissists are only bound by what they think they *can or cannot do*, based on whether or not they'll get caught or whether or not there will be consequences for their actions, it puts things in a whole different light. A narcissist is someone who is entirely without moral code, empathy, or anything else that makes a person \"human\" or \"normal\". There is no reciprocity with narcissists. There is no fairness. So, you can keep giving and giving, trying and trying, doing and doing, and *it won't matter*. Literally nothing you do will change the empty beings that they are - and nothing you do will make them value you, protect you, or treat you with respect. \n\nSo, by that logic, it doesn't make sense to pour ANY of your energy into these creatures. They are hopeless, broken entities who are already condemned. In addition, to choose not to fully guard and protect yourself around them is foolish. It's like walking into a tiger's cage while hoping that the tiger will behave like a bunny rabbit. It is important to acknowledge the harsh reality of a narcissist, who they are and what they're capable of doing to you.

My younger brother (15M) gets only the momentary anger stuff, like after he drops something or makes a sound, all his negotiations with parents regarding friends and school are a fair bit cooler.\n\nMy parents are emotionally abusive (never hit us except when we were young) but it's getting worse. I have always wanted to move out but never did much for it, I was going to last year with my best friend but that got sidelined after I had some mental health issues take more priority as I attempted to kill myself, was a miracle I survived but some part of me wished I didn't as after that moment parents blamed me for it and non-stop belittled me for it, and anytime they would throw an insult at me they would say \"How could you make any good decisions, you were soo stupid you tried to kill yourself, and you even failed at that.\" My dad has an anger problem you could say, every thing you did (especially mistakes) he would get incredibly loud shouting and belittling us while we tried to fix it and would always step in and take the mop or whatever and clean it up himself and would shout at us across the house when we ran away. He also makes demands, he will demand we do something and if we don't move within half a second he yells very loud repetitively to do it, and after you did it he would rant about how he asked earlier and everything is off now. A big thing in the house was us getting good grades (especially me so as they singled me and abuse me the most), and anything the teacher sent, every report, every homework piece, every email we would have to endure hours of sitting and getting yelled at past the point of crying. This lead to us all begging teachers to not email things and even go into their database to swap the email to a fake one. They are also incredibly manipulating, and they try and keep us dependant on them in one way or another. It was this seemingly random and overreactive moments that made me have recurring nightmares about my parents killing me, usually by stabbing, this lead to me always scanning for weapons in any situation, and looking for escape routes, playing out I would survive given dad being angry.\n\nFor the past year and more they have kept trying to tell me that my bestfriend is manipulating me to do anything she disagrees with, and talks to my brothers and try make them hate my bestfriend (who my brothers still think is cool). I always tried to keep most friendships and relationships hidden from them.  And they use this as insults as to why I don't have a girlfriend and why no one will love me. They are also very seclusive family and so the only family I know is my grandparents on mum's side, don't even know my sister who my dad left when she was young. They also repetitively lie to try and gaslight us, and just be annoying.\n\nThe house is fairly rich, Mum being the major earner, but that never translates into anything for us, Mum has a shopping addiction and spends at least $100,000 every year on useless things and both parents having purchased brand new cars each totalling over $160,000 and yet they complain about how much we use (very very little) and are trying to basically extort me with trying to charge me $80/day for nothing and simply being part of the family, and suspending all that they pay for anything trying to force me to get all my own appliances and such. Unfortunately due to how involved in work mum is she uses this to cut my business life off, talking shit about me to associates and potential clients, and where she wasn't doing that she was using me as like a side deal for hiring, where if you got her you also got me consulting on it as well.\n\nAnother common behaviour is Mum saying \"you used to be so athletic\" or \"you used to be so smart\" and constantly despising anything I do, and more recently banning all games (as apparently they contribute to me not achieving in her standards as much). It hurts a lot and makes me really angry.\n\nAnother problem is my brother would do something that would anger dad and rush and hide and wait until dad found me and put all the abuse that way.\n\nI have tried so much to improve my parents but it all is not worth it and they haven't improved at all, and they even use all the things I said to try and open communication against me. And I barely talk to my dad, when he is not in a bad mood he is like the step dad you barely know, occassional comments on small things he heard about me or events. I used to talk to mum a lot even though I hated her abuse but I thought it was the right thing to do.\n\nWe have just moved and I know nobody here and am too far away from everyone I have ever known and support people. My best friend lives a way away, I could fly there but they have a very cramped space, to move out with him would require a fair bit of setup first. I can't go overseas as since I'm under 18 they can legally prevent me from it.

{"post_id": "acrktl", "created_utc": 1546669374, "title": "An Overview of Codependency: A Follow-Up Essay", "author": "PossiblyAThrowway", "self_text": "I wanted to write this in response to some questions I had in my last post about how narcissists and codependents attract each other and why it doesn't work. One question that stood out to me was the question of what exactly codependency is. I thought that this would be a great topic to cover as a follow-up - to define codependency, outline the signs and symptoms, outline the root cause, and again cover the fix.\n\n\\---\n\nWhat exactly *is* codependency? One thing I noticed in my research is that nobody - not even highly educated and well-spoken psychologists - seem to accurately describe the condition. Some say that codependency is simply enabling self-destructive behavior in another person. Others argue that it is obsessive infatuation. Others still believe that it is simply a defense mechanism people employ when they get into a relationship with a toxic individual, such as someone with NPD. Some even confuse codependents with Highly Sensitive People (HSP). But, none of these are truly accurate definitions of the condition. So, I wanted to create my own definition based on the research I did as well as my own self-reflection. So, without further ado:\n\n*Codependency is a mental health condition in which a person bases the entirety of their self-worth on whether or not other people validate them, support them, or - most importantly - need them.*\n\nSo, what are the signs and symptoms of codependency? There are a number of self-defeating and dysfunctional behaviors and thought processes that codependents engage in and utilize.\n\n1. **Without a partner, codependents suffer from crippling romantic loneliness.** Codependents base their self-worth on whether or not they \"have someone in their life.\" The pursuit of romance is the all-consuming goal of a codependent person and literally everything they do or achieve is in some way working toward the goal of getting into a relationship.\n2. **Codependents are 'ultra-hypersensitive' to the emotions of others and their empathy knows no bounds - particularly in romantic relationships.** Codependent people will sacrifice the entirety of themselves, to their own detriment, in the pursuit of making people feel better when they are down. This effect increases exponentially when the codependent gets into a relationship - there is a reason they are known as the 'people-pleasers' and 'fixers' of relationships.\n3. **Codependents shut down when they are the cause of another person's pain/anxiety.** Telling a codependent that they are upsetting you is like playing a GPU-intensive game and spawning too many moving objects into the game world - the codependent's mind crashes, just like the computer crashes. This is because the codependent is literally split and conflicted as to what they should do. On the one hand, when someone is upset, the codependent's instinct is to flock to the downhearted person, shower them with affection and either compensate for or erase the negative emotions. On the other hand, this very behavior is what upsets the other person, so the codependent knows they should back off. But, if they back off, they can't be there for them. This infinite feedback loop can only be cut off once normal conversation resumes again.\n4. **Codependents have the tendency to idealize in relationships.** Codependents often lack the confidence to maintain a realistic view of their partner, even if they are actually toxic, and they cannot bring themselves to 'discard' their partners because to discard means to end the relationship, which means failure, which the codependent can't handle. Codepedents rather stay in a constant, perpetual state of idealization, thinking that their partner is the best person all the time - hence why some refer to codependency as obsessive love. They quickly come to miss their partners in relationships. While someone of normal mental capacity might miss their partner after a few weeks of diminished presence or contact, the codependent will miss their partner within the hour. This is why codependents need to keep in constant contact with their significant others and this loneliness leads to the classic smothering behavior of codependents. You could also give q codependent a laundry list of reasons why they aren't good enough and they will smile through it all because they think to themselves \"If this is what I need to let them do to keep them around, so be it. They're my other half and I'd rather have a toxic second half than no half at all.\"\n5. **Codependents have a fear of abandonment.** In romantic relationships, codependents are in a constant state of fear that their partner will leave them. Codependents fear that their partner is upset with them and will eventually cut them off. Or they fear that the friends of their romantic partner are secretly telling them to leave the relationship behind their back. Any suggestion of \"space\" or \"a break\" sends the codependent into complete panic, as their greatest fear appears to begin materializing.\n6. **Codependents crave being part of social circles and abhor being ignored - they are 'catastrophizers'.** Codependents may engage in gossip - good or bad - and will often share their own personal information and insecurities with others and assure them that they are non-judgmental and completely trustworthy in an effort to get them to share back in return. This creates the 'closeness' and validation that codependents crave. When this doesn't happen and a codependent is ignored, they can become fearful and go through what I explained in points 3 and 4. When they are ignored, they say it *could* be the person going through their everyday life. Or maybe they hate them now and have left them. Or maybe they're in the hospital, sick. Or maybe they're *dead.* And, because codependents are 'ultra-hypersensitive' to these things, they have also thoroughly convinced themselves that everybody around them knows if the person in question is angry at them, or sick, or dead, and is purposefully not telling them. Again, this dread is only diminished when normal conversations return.\n7. **Codependents change who they are to fit the needs of those around them.** Codependents are 'social chameleons,' who adapt to their situation. They become whoever they need to be to gain the approval of whoever it is they want to be with. They will change jobs, change friends, take on more responsibility, and, in extreme situations, even temporarily adopt different moral and ethical codes in order to prove their worthiness to the person whose approval they crave.\n8. **Breakups and other emotionally traumatizing occasions leave codependents feeling bitter and overwhelmed with grief.** When a relationship involving a codependent ends, the codependent believes they have failed at their duty and becomes a shell of who they once perhaps were. They experience the pain and anguish of breakups and other sad events much harder than the average person. What may take a normal person one month to grieve over will take the codependent three to four months to grieve over. In addition, the codependent's strongest emotion next to sadness will be feeling immensely unappreciated, especially if they were the one broken up with. More often than not, the codependent put a lot more into the relationship, and they know it. In their mind it was cruel and heartless to not only put less work into the relationship but also leave after everything they had done to make them happy.\n\nSo, if you experience most or all of these signs, you may very well be a codependent person. If you are, you're probably wondering, *why the hell am I like this!?* Well, there are a number of possible reasons. Like most mental conditions, they start from childhood and how we were raised. If you were raised by ultra-strict parents or you were led to believe that failure is not an option and that failure is the end rather than a necessary step in the journey of life, you are significantly more likely to develop codependent behaviors. This is because, at the heart of a codependent's dysfunction is literally a fear of failure... *within relationships*.\n\nNow that all of this information is available, the final question remains: what is the fix? I know what you're thinking. *I can't love someone else unless I love myself first.* Yes, and no. Loving oneself is incredibly important. However, it is *not* more important than surrounding yourself with people you love and who love and support you. I said in my last post, life is too short for 90/10 relationships. In addition, this point doesn't really matter anyway because a lack of self-love is not the root of codependency. It is in fact a lack of *self-knowledge*. Codependent people are, again, 'social chameleons' and need direction and guidance as to who they 'should' be. Without this guidance - at least from the perspective of non-codependents - they may appear to be aimless, lacking in ambition, and even lazy. These things are not true, as they are capable of putting tremendous amounts of work into what drives them. The issue is that they have a pinpoint focus on the wrong thing: relationships, which are not going to help the codependent learn themselves.\n\nSo, how do you learn yourself? Face your fear and accept the risk of failure, and you will come to see that failure is never as bad as it seems. Lose yourself in your hobbies. Find new ones. Try different jobs. Experience life, both with others and by yourself. You will come to learn about yourself through taking risks and trying things and meeting people you may not have initially wanted to. But, in doing so, you will find yourself. Once you've found yourself, it will be significantly easier to love yourself. Once you know and love yourself, you will be your own person and you will naturally attract someone who will provide you the loving relationship you so desire. And, you won't need to change yourself to keep the relationship happy and alive. You will do it by simply being you!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We became pretty close in part because of our shared time together but from the get go we all could tell something what odd about the guy.\n\nHe routinely would learn of someone else\u2019s technique and claim it as his own. He would ask for help with something, but as a way to demonstrate how he knew better and rebuttal. He would sneak around and manipulate things and people and relished in the believe he was getting away with it even though we were all aware, clear as day what he did. \n\nOver time as we got closer as friends things got stranger. I always had this suspicion that his conduct via text / other people\u2019s accounts / social media was not the person I knew. In many ways the time we spent together as friends was actually me spending time with myself, he created a \u201ccharacter\u201d of someone I\u2019d be friends with and acted that part for the entire time I knew him until we had a falling out.\n\nIt was in the after math and his soon to follow leaving out workplace that the term \u201cnarcissist\u201d was brought up to me and good lord, he was a text book example, a sterling case study of severe narcissism. \n\nWhat got me about him though, and something I have seen little on in my extensive research into the topic (It is so incredibly fascinating to research this and just see everything that didn\u2019t seem right explained so textbook) is his religious justification for his actions, and in a way how dangerous of a person it made him. \n\nHe was devoutely religious, but what was interesting is the narcissism led him beyond it. Almost to extremism. He was a devout Christian, but expressed near disdain for modern Christianity and he felt that his religious convictions were true Christianity, that he was above mainstream Christianity. Like he had been chosen by god.\n\nWhat was so dangerous about this was he used this belief to justify WHY he could do no wrong. This person was fired after a number of incredibly troubling secrets and behaviors came to light, and almost immediately he took to social media to draft a manifesto to play the victim card and admit to everything he did wrong, but use \u201cgods will\u201d and the lense of victimhood to show that he obviously was in the right and was treated unfairly. \n\nBehind the scenes he often fantasized of violence / the apocalypse (is a doomsday prep of sorts, or claims to be) / stockpiles guns / believes that according to the Bible we are in the end times and that \u201che can do whatever he wants because soon it won\u2019t matter anyway.\u201d \n\nThese expressions of religious justification for ANY behavior are incredibly concerning. Luckily he is out of my life, although the scars will stick with me for life I definitely know how to identify and handle a narcissist now, but I fear for those around him wherever he goes due to this. \n\nFrom what I have read there\u2019s a ton of information on how narcissist self ensure their behaviors and use internal justifications that they\u2019re correct. But the use of god, and lets be clear god for him in practice is his subconscious, seems in my experience to lead to an ever more dangerous individual. Not only does he believe his actions are just, but god does too, it easily could lead to escalations into violent fantasies becoming actions. \n\nHas anyone else dealt or seen this in action before?

I'm in my last semester of college and I've had one hell of a ride with narcissists and manipulative people. The latest situation I am in is with 2 (maybe 3?) of my roommates who I formerly considered really close friends of mine. They used to always love talking to me and hanging out with me. Everything seemed nice, but over time they started questioning my decisions and why I was doing things. It's one thing to give advice to a friend who needs it, but they kept giving me unwarranted advice that felt more like commands than anything else. If I didn't follow their advice then they would get visibly annoyed or tell me that I wasn't doing anything right. Back then it wasn't as visible and I felt like I truly had friends. They were the first friends I had made since childhood, so I don't feel bad about not realizing their manipulative tendencies, but I wish I knew then what I know now so I could have avoided the situation I am in now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI currently live with these 3 people. I was not a good roommate and didn't do things around the house like washing dishes. I take responsibility for not contributing to the house's well-being. I think anger towards me was justified, but I don't think what I'm responsible justifies my friends' behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started to be the butt of their jokes more and more often. I was not used to speaking up for myself so this caught me off guard. I didn't want to fight with them or make them mad, so I just let it slide. This amped up throughout the semester with them insulting my intelligence, calling me weak, doing things without me, and making really insulting \"jokes\" about me (both to my face and behind my back). This really caught me off guard and I felt really shitty all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter Christmas, I had a long talk with the friend who I feel closest to. He, for the first time I can ever remember, told me how he felt about my actions around the house and how he saw me. I felt like we really connected and that our friendship was being repaired. However, the patterns have started again since then and I feel really invisible and broken. I was talking with all 3 of them tonight and drinking, and the subject of my family came up. They told me to take responsibility for my actions (some of the solid advice I got from them before), but refused to recognize anything I have done that is responsible. They ignored their own responsibilities for their own behaviors, which was very ironic to me. We talked about all kinds of things but every time I started talking, I was interrupted. I was shut out of the conversations constantly and was used in their \"jokes\" even more. I felt like I had repaired our friendship but it doesn't seem to be the case. I realized that I've been trying my absolute best to conform to their standards and it's killing me inside. They don't accept me for who I am. They think I am weak, useless, and easy to pick on.

It clears up the murky water a bit.\n\nDad: My dad is really a generous man, he's always lavished me and my sister with gifts, and spoiled us rotten. I'll be frank when I say that their financial situation is kind [they criticize my mother for her money, more on that later].\n\nHe's been tactical in trying to achieve what benefits his family. However, my father is very clearly emotionally manipulative in the way he acts. He constantly will play games to turn the tide to his favor, and can tend to mess with my sympathies more often than not. \n\nMy dad takes the personality and values of his new wife. He's usually pretty laid back in terms of small things, and now I find him hard to recognize. He's still dad, but he acts like her more and more.\n\nHe's extremely stubborn, and argumentative to a fault. If he can't manipulate the situation, then he may come to a solid stance. I do try to end the discussion there, because it could either go on for ages or become heated.\n\nMy dad is also a heavy drinker and a long time smoker. \n\nTLDR; My dad is a sweet man and very considerate but manipulates the feelings of others.\n\nMartha: Martha, as I'll call her for now, is my stepmother. \n\nMartha has a similar problem, but tenfold and much more. Where as my father holds a bundle, she may have a caravan of problems in comparison. \n\nSimilar to my dad, she is also a manipulator. She has a victim complex to a good degree. She has the inability to take ownership of her faults, and can tend to throw things back at people.\n\nShe is:\n\n\u2022Always monitoring everything.\n\u2022Critical and will make biting remarks. Comments that tend to hold her own daughters in high regard and compares me to them.\n\u2022Constantly judging the finances of my mother's home and attacking my mother's character in front of me.\n\u2022At times, physically violent. While not common, my stepmother has threatened to strike me, has grabbed me by my face, pushed around my father, and thrown my dad onto the ground in a heated argument.\n\u2022Holding tangible riches over my head, and used to lead me to believe that I couldn't say anything because I was spoiled by her.\n\u2022Comments on my inadequacy, and has immediately denied my claims at having a low-self esteem. Claiming she knows very well I don't.\n\u2022Claims that simple information is a display of attitude. Such as comments where I say that I had finished what she asked, without any tonal implications.\n\u2022Has named me attention seeking.\n\nOf course, I know the woman to be a very sweet lady at times. Although she makes me feel less than human, and has warped my perception on what the average household has looked like. \n\nI freak out when her car pulls into the driveway, even if I have completed everything she asked. I fear her.\n\nTLDR: I keep spouting stuff about my stepmother but she can be a really good woman. I just always feel on edge around here, and am paranoid about when she gets home.\n\n\nI have been led to believe that the average couple fights as much as they do. I can't tell you if this is true or not, so I'd like some help here. They on average fight about 50% of the time I'm with them. I know when I'm gone they fight as well, my step sister has talked to be about that before. I'd say that they threaten divorce almost every time they argue as well.\n\nI believe my dad lives in fear of his wife. He constantly deletes texts he's had with my mother for fear that she gets some sort of idea. It would make sense as they fight frequently and he's been hit before. He has expressed his unhappiness on multiple occasions, most when he was drunk. Once in a port city the two had gotten into a fights. He took off his flip flops and threatened to jump off the bridge. The bridge didn't look that tall, but it was moderately sized so I couldn't tell if he was going to get hurt. So reasonably I ran ahead to try to dissuade him, and everyone had said I was overreacting?\n\nI also believe that their household situation has taken a toll on my mental health. This could be me just going mad on my own, but I know it's influencing things. \n\nI have been talking to myself more, it happens for little things, to make sure I'm in check. But I can remember going on tangents ranting to myself, or even reassuring myself, putting myself down, or just talking when I'm lonely.\n\nThe house certainly hasn't helped with the balance of chemicals in my head. It's brought that down lower, and my self esteem has fallen with that too.\n\nI found myself sobbing yesterday in particular because I was breaking down. The mental pressure of everything I do going to hurt my mom was too much. If I make a mistake it's only more fuel to attack her with.\n\nI don't know if this is all a very obvious answer, but I just want some sort of clarity.

Here's an article by  Kaleah LaRoche on how such a toxic dynamic comes into being. I'm not defending the narcissists, who I believe are very aware and also deliberative in their sadistic actions. But it's also important to recognize the patterns of us victims, so as to equip ourselves against falling into such toxic engagements in the future.\n\nNarcissists have an \u201cavoidant\u201d attachment style and most people who are strongly affected by a narcissist are of the \u201canxious\u201d attachment style. Those who have high anxiety responses to the narcissistic devaluing and discarding are likely experiencing a triggering of attachment anxieties, and once those anxieties are triggered it can take a long time to calm down completely.\n\nThis explains the Post Traumatic Stress responses in those whose abandonment and rejection wounds are being triggered. Anxious responses to having a close relationship abruptly severed is not to be taken lightly. Infants who experience a disconnect with a primary caregiver can experience that disconnect as a threat to their life. Infants depend entirely upon that parental figure for their very survival. Infants and young children whose needs were not met on a consistent basis will develop either an avoidant or anxious attachment to their primary caregiver. These attachment styles are transferred to adult romantic relationships.\n\nAvoidants are not all narcissists but they do have an ability to detach emotionally from the relationship which triggers an \u201canxious\u201d person\u2019s attachment anxiety. Avoidants are not comfortable with too much closeness so their relational dynamic is to push their significant other away to create a \u201csafe\u201d emotional distance. Anxious styles, who desire a lot of closeness with their partners, experience being pushed away as rejection or abandonment which trigger a deep seated anxiety. Avoidants also tend to find fault with their partner and blame them for any issues in the relationship. Anxious styles tend to find fault with themselves and blame themselves. So in a relationship like this, all fingers are pointing towards the anxious person which explains why the anxious person feels responsible when the avoidant detaches from the relationship.\n\nWhen a relationship between and avoidant and anxious style ends, the avoidant can easily detach from the relationship and move on where the anxious person is plagued by a strong need to reconnect with that person. This strong need to reconnect is not logical. It is a deeply entrenched emotional pattern. The avoidants\u2019 behavior can be abusive and unacceptable but it doesn\u2019t change the anxious person\u2019s strong pull to reconnect. There is something deeply ingrained in the anxious person that feels their very survival depends upon their connection with that person.\n\nThe irony in understanding these styles is that if an anxious style hooks up with a secure style, these anxieties are calmed through consistent feedback and the anxious person becomes much more secure in the relationship. Even when the relationship ends the anxious person isn\u2019t triggered in the  way he or she would be with an avoidant, because there is open, honest communication and feedback where the secure person shares in the responsibility for the relationship issues ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I looked.\n\nIt turns out he didn't  leave me for the woman I thought he did... the one he posted pics on Instagram with during the Discard dance. It seems like it's some other young woman in her 20s; meanwhile, he is pushing 40 and is still living at home with his parents.\n\nHonestly... I didn't really feel any jealousy. While it still made me anxious to even see his world, and a bit angry to see that it appears to be business as usual, his Instagram was actually kind of sad. At least to me, anyway, because I saw the situation for what it was... and I saw that he hasn't actually gotten over me. For months, he has been decked out in items of clothing I'd given him, and apparently has even been wearing a bright orange jacket.\n\nFyi: my signature jacket last year was a bright orange hunting jacket. Nex is a photographer and did a photoshoot with me wearing the jacket; he posted it on his Instagram last year. My jacket was so weird and out there that it was basically equated with me. And he even said last year, explicitly: \"Orange is your color.\" \n\nThere is no coincidence here.\n\nI read on one of the other posts that Narcs are able to go on, business as usual, by fracturing themselves through repression. So while they may not pay any outward \"price,\" they literally lose their soul in their process of \"lather, rinse, repeat\" (or groom new target, discard, hoover, disappear without a trace)... they have no real emotions, because if they allowed themselves to feel them, they'd eventually have to confront nasty, difficult emotions like guilt and shame.\n\nSo, seeing my Nex wearing a bright orange jacket with the scarf I gave him last year... or in posters of his DJ show he made with him wearing a tshirt I gave him the night we consummated our relationship successfully for the first time (he had ED)... it wasnt exactly validating (although it did restore my faith in humanity a little, as in karmic justice and the inability to truly, truly cut off all human emotion), but it did make me really sad. If it's not downright emotional attachment that's causing him to cling to remnants of our relationship, which ended nearly a year ago, he must be so fractured, so out of touch with himself, to be able to still energetically engage with me so blatantly while living his life in every other capacity as if I don't even exist. He hasn't  reached out to me for 8 months-- and when he discarded in February, he disappeared without a trace. And that's  what made it hurt so much-- it was like he moved me to the trash bin and clicked \"delete forever.\"\n\nWorth noting is that I have nothing he has given me: it's either been burned or given away to nobody I know. I've even gotten rid of most everything even remotely associated with him (like clothing of mine he liked). I cannot imagine wearing an article of clothing he gave me without literally getting a sour pit in my stomach.\n\nHe is either so repressed that it comes out subconsciously, or fervently justifying to himself how he can wear these things without connection to me. But the proof is in the pudding... and while it's mildly validating to know for a fact that I at least meant something to him, I feel bad for any woman he's involved with. \n\nCan you imagine going out with a guy who wears all of the clothes his ex girlfriend gave him?\n\nThe feelings of pity and genuine hope that he gets help and bottoms out (for his own sake) have all but fully replaced the anger and jealousy that were in my heart following the discard. I still love him... I try to love everybody.  And with love I pray he gets help to move beyond the past.\n\nHappy 2019, y'all. \n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We were fighting about money that I had earned and what to do with it. I was trying to explain my side and opinion on the matter, while he told me over and over again that it was going to be a very certain way (pay his credit card off), or this would be the last fight ever. I was trying very desperately to explain that we have bills and rent to pay. He eventually got up, packed some things, and walked out, saying I was a selfish bitch, greedy, and that he didn't know where I learnt this. I am with my parents now, who are trying to help. \n\nWe've been together for 6 years and I was 18 when I met him. My adult life has centered around him and his choices for us. He's called me a bitch, greedy, selfish, stupid, retarded, fat, lazy, worthless and multiple other things in his native language weekly. I've been facing continual abuse, mainly emotional and mental, though he's been physical in the past. I understand that now. \n\nI've been facing down his constant need for attention and have been doing my best to give him what he needs. I abandoned my family twice for him. I built a home for us and I cooked, cleaned, worked, while he spends time on his laptop. He hasn't cooked a meal for us in years. He hasn't worked a job since 2013. The new job he has is one where he doesn't need to go in if he doesn't want to and he won't. I wrote papers for him in university and let him cheat off of me in tests. I worked constantly for the past 4 years. And he tells me, or told me before he walked out, that he wasn't happy. That he feels like I don't love him. That I wasn't giving him enough affection. That he feels like we're nothing but roommates. That I betrayed him by talking to my mother. \n\nMeanwhile, he gives me the silent treatment weekly for a perceived offense. He withholds affection and wouldn't kiss me goodbye or even look at me when I ask him a question. He'd purposely make a show of sleeping as far away from me on the bed as he could. He would withhold sex, or say I wasn't enthusiastic enough about it. I felt like the worst person in the world and I would frantically try to prove to him otherwise. I'd do things I'd normally not want to do, all for him to show me some love and kindness.  When we were fine, I'd try tell him a story or something interesting I'd read, and he'd say 'Can you just get to the point? I don't need to hear this'.He'd control all the money I made, monitoring how much I made and where it went. He'd check my phone constantly, read my messages and emails, and even check my internet searches. He accused me of being suspicious and unfaithful, though I swear on my life, I never once thought of cheating, even when he was at his worst. \n\nI've learnt, through his mother, that he has no plans to apologize to me and that they wonder why I'm not talking to him. \n\nI want desperately to go back and say I'm sorry and have him give me that affection again. I've been sitting here simultaneously feeling like screaming and lying on the floor and not moving. I miss that affection.

That I deserved genuine love because I loved him unconditionally. My brain is telling me he's a narcissist and that he'll never love me. I know what he did was wrong and that I was abused.

My home and space and everything in that home are gone. My life was taken. \n\nI don't know what to do. I'm scared. I can't sleep. Why is this happening to me?

This in itself made me think he was actually serious about wanting to try again and showing me it wasn\u2019t only about what I did for him.

I had previously only had one serious relationship, which I ended after a number of years as we started dating in school and I felt that we eventually drifted apart. Communication isn't my strong point, and I'm a quiet person. We never really had arguments, partly because we got on well, and partly because neither of us communicated well.\n\nMy wife and I dated for a while, things were going great. Not long after we got together, I got really sick. After over a year of specialists, tests etc, I was eventually diagnosed with a chronic condition which had/has a moderately strong negative effect on my daily life. Medication helped me feel somewhat better, but nowhere near \"normal\". I spiraled in to depression, and I'm still working my way out of it.\n\nBefore I got sick, I enjoyed going out, seeing friends, being active. Once I got sick, I only ever wanted to stay home, avoiding everyone and everything. I had no energy for anything. This was half because of the illness, and half because of the depression.\n\nMy wife has mental health issues as well, so since the start it's always been a bit rocky at times. She is often very depressed and suffers from anxiety. She is often suicidal, and she is terrified of me leaving her as she doesn't have many friends, doesn't get along with her family, and does not like her life. We argue often - and since I had only ever had one significant relationship before this one and we never argued much, I didn't have a reference point for a healthy relationship. I thought this was all normal.\n\nWhen I got sick, I went from being a happy, healthy young adult to a depressed shell of my former self. I was suicidal. I forgot how to live or why to live. I convinced myself that the relationship was normal, and that it was a good thing. I withdrew from all of my friends and shut myself off. My mental health has slowly been getting better over the years, and I was sure that it was because of her. She is generally supportive and I do believe that she has helped.\n\nI was convinced for so long that this was going to be my life - being sick, depressed, no energy, and always feeling like I'm screwing everything up. Our arguments are always my fault, I always feel like I'm walking on eggshells, and she has accused me of emotionally abusing her a number of times.\n\nSome time last year I started to have a nagging feeling that maybe I'm the one who is being emotionally abused, but I pushed it away. For months I ignored it. We got married. Then, in quick succession I did two things that I am ashamed of. I hurt her badly. A discussion with someone triggered something that deeply affected her in the past, causing her significant emotional trauma. I was present, and while I vehemently opposed the other person's point of view and I did speak up a couple of times, I did not speak up enough in my wife's defence and she did not feel supported by me at all in that instance. A few weeks later, I stood up for a co-worker. What I did was the right thing, but *how* I did it was wrong. My wife felt betrayed that I stood up for my co-worker but not for her.\n\nThen at some point near the end of 2018, I finally accepted the possibility that I was in an abusive relationship. I had a paradigm shift in my outlook. I started to consider that maybe I don't have to live the rest of my life like this. Perhaps I am depressed *because* of my life and my relationship. Maybe the relationship is holding me back, stopping me from reclaiming who I used to be.\n\nI didn't actually know what an abusive relationship was, so I did some research. The second website I looked at listed \"walking on eggshells\" as a sign - the exact words I had said to my wife recently about how I felt around her. I kept reading, and my experiences matched so many signs of an abusive relationship:\n\n* I feel like I am constantly walking on eggshells, too afraid to say anything.\n* due to my illness, my memory is poor but she has always insisted that my version of events was wrong.\n* any time I have a grievance, she demands that I give examples. I can almost never recall any specific examples (even if I know I am right) and she uses it to dismiss my concerns.\n* she occasionally physically abused me (hit my chest, pushed me). This stopped when I put my foot down a few years ago.\n* everything is always my fault. If I do something wrong, she blames me. If she does something wrong, she usually blames me. If something occurs as a result of something that we both did, she blames me.\n* our arguments are usually big, and she usually does not relent until I retreat (mentally) or just break down. I recently realised that it's at the point that I usually apologise if we get in to an argument, even if I don't think I've done anything wrong, as I can't handle the arguments.\n* she often lies to others, but in the last 6 months she has lied to me twice about serious things. When I confronted her about it, she repeatedly denied that she lied, and still denies it.\n* her general attitude towards me feels like it is full of contempt. She will often insult me.\n* she told me that she didn't like some of my friends. The main reason I withdrew from my friends was because of my depression, but this was also a factor for it.\n\nIf you stopped reading here then you'd say that obviously I am in an abusive relationship - but it's only half of the story.\n\nI essentially promised her a happy, fun, adventurous person, and then when I got sick I become something completely different. I'm a very introverted person, my memory is terrible, and I am horrible at communicating. Throw in a heavy sprinkling of depression, and I have no doubt that I am the root cause of so many of the problems in our relationship. Sometimes I am so exhausted that I can't handle doing anything and I selfishly retreat or shirk my responsibilities. I am terrible with money. I am the sole income earner, and I have got us in to debt a number of times. She has accused me a number of times of being financially abusive, but she has full access to all of our money, accounts, credit cards, etc, and I have asked her a number of times to take on the responsibility of budgeting and finances as I know I'm not good at it.\n\nI haven't spoken to her about this yet as I've needed some time to process it. I definitely do not think she will take it well. We both have mental health issues, and I take a lot of responsibility for the problems caused in our relationship over the years, but should that excuse her behavior? Is it still emotional abuse if the abuser is not trying to do it, or is unaware they are doing it? Even if I can convince her to change, how can we move forward from this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr - I think I'm in an abusive relationship but I do not believe my wife is doing it deliberately.

She left me hanging. \n\nThe next day at 6:30am I texted her, asked her to give me my gym key back.

She responded saying that i needed to give her a writen breakdown of everything. \n\nI sent her that today and she went crazy, said that that\u2019s not a valid document, that if i wanted to play the game then she charges $10 and hour for cleaning and unpacking my apartment (i never asked her) and then i said, that\u2019s not how it works. \n\nShe then proceeds to tell me that she\u2019ll be writing her own document and taking me to court because she failed her medical program because of me since I\u2019m a psychopath and stalking her and she had to deal with that. \n\nThen she texts me saying \u201cSo I\u2019m curious how many times and one crazy bitch change your locks, You know you have a problem when you have to do that so often, but i warned you\u201d \n\nWarned me?

How stupid could i be? I had proof of cheating, I didn\u2019t know to what degree it was, I thought it was with one. She\u2019s an alcoholic and addicted to adderall. \n\nWtf was i thinking being with her. Her threats are her way of trying to control me, knock me back into submission, but I\u2019m not giving in so she keeps harassing me. \n\nI have her blocked from everything but iMessage, as i was hoping to get my money back. \n\nNow I can\u2019t get rid of her. She\u2019s supposed to already have other supplies, wtf does she want with me. \n\nI told her to leave me alone.\n\nToday she appeared at my front door demanding some of her stuff.. \n\nAnd then after she left, she flipped me off.. \n\nShe the then texted me, \u201cthat\u2019s it, I\u2019m done with your shit\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t stand you\u201d\n\nDoes this mean she\u2019s finally gonna leave me alone for good?

I remember feeling so hurt by so many actions. But then I also see behaviours from me that victims often describe of their abusers.\n\nWhen I was with my partner, I often felt I wasn't heard. I would frequently be trying to communicate with him, usually about an action of his that was harming me, to receive only anger or stonewalling in return. This type of reaction made me feel frantic, and I would relentlessly try to be heard and understood. Sometimes I would rephrase things multiple times to try and be heard. I'm basically afraid that I was essentially gaslighting by trying to get him to hear my story instead of accepting that he just didn't agree.\n\nI see people talking about their abusers being relentless, and not giving them peace. Sometimes I feel like I was that person - pushing and trying to be heard. But I'm unable to figure out if I did that because I was being abused and needed so badly to be heard, or if I was the abuser and was pushing to be right or have control. He often told me I didn't give him peace and it felt like I was latching on to him and not letting go.\n\nI don't know how I will ever really be able to tell, but I've been avoiding dating again until I can know because if I am abusive, I don't want to hurt someone else again. It feels like all I wanted was communication, but what if I'm just telling myself that to avoid recognizing that my behaviours were harmful?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I\u2019ll try to keep it as to the point as possible. I am seeking out help in this community because of recent events that transpired in my life and caused me to do a lot of self reflection and research looking for answers. \n\nI have come to discover the huge possibility that my ex is and always was a covert narcissist. And I had no idea until now. I am having trouble wrapping my brain around this because I was with the man for over 6 years and it never crossed my mind until now. I always considered myself to be intuitive and I feel like I have been dupped that I could be so completely blind to this possibility. \n\nSo I am going to tell you my story and some of things I have been though with him (please don\u2019t shame me) and I am open to your advice and opinions on whether he really is a narcissist. \n\nThe recent events that brought me to this point are that my now ex boyfriend of over 6 years ghosted (discarded) me out of the blue, with no warning signs, he just left without a trace. I tried to contact him at first for week or so and then gave up because I realized what he was doing and resigned myself to the idea that if he wanted to talk to me he would. He quit talking to me on all social media, changed his phone number and his Facebook status to single and disappeared into thin air. 3 months (around the holidays) later, after a lot of self reflection and thinking constantly about what happened in our relationship to make him do this to me, I found out he had suddenly blocked me. The reason? He posted a photo of his new girl friend, some young naive early 20\u2019s college student (I am in my late 20s by the way and he is nearing 30). I am assuming he didn\u2019t want me to see it, not sure why, it\u2019s not like I would have contacted him anyway, we hadn\u2019t talked in 3 months. Oddly though, his Facebook profile is now public and it never was before AND he still has photos of him and I on it. Why not delete those? And he didn\u2019t tag her in the post, just put her picture up, which I thought was odd. Anyway I could speculate about this forever but, I\u2019ll continue... \n\nThat broke me. It upset me more than I had been in the last 3 months perhaps because I was holding onto the small hope that he would realize his \u201cmistake\u201d and come back (and because he had come back before) but realizing he had moved on it was like he just pushed the knife in deeper. I was even more devastated that he was willing to throw 6 years of good friendship/companionship away on some 20 something year old girl. \n\nSo I began desperately looking for answers, because I wasn\u2019t going to get any closure from him, clearly and I began asking myself how could someone have the ability to just cut someone off emotionally and cut them out of their life after so long and so many good memories? \n\nAnd that is when I came across the word narcissism. After talking to a friend who had been through this. I haven\u2019t honestly given this word much thought before now. Now it\u2019s all I think about. \n\nI was forced to reflect on our relationship (because while when he left things were okay previously our relationship wasn\u2019t perfect, you\u2019ll see). But when he ghosted things were okay, they weren\u2019t great, but I could tell we were moving apart, more on that later. We were just going in different directions. I am on a temporary work assignment in another state and he used that opportunity to take the easy way out. I figured he would be an adult and talk to me about it if something was wrong. He had ample opportunity. But then instead he disappeared. There was no blow up fight where we knew it was over, no yelling screaming, he just disappeared quietly into the night like I never existed like nothing ever happened. \n\nAfter sitting down to really think about how I was treated by him and our relationship. I NEVER should have stayed, EVER but I guess I was weak. \n\nI will add that we were long distance for part of our relationship. So that may have played a factor. I am going to talk about the \u201cbad stuff\u201d but just know it wasn\u2019t all bad. There was a good bit of it that wasn\u2019t. I know you will all think wow she was crazy to put up with this for so long, I wouldn\u2019t disagree with you, but you know the saying \u201clove is blind\u201d and apparently I didn\u2019t know my worth. This is hard for me to admit because I never thought I was this person. \n\nIf he is a narc, looking back I don\u2019t think he is one in the traditional sense. He wasn\u2019t grandiose or charismatic, he wasn\u2019t violent, he wasn\u2019t controlling. But he had a very low self esteem and he was selfish. He only thought about himself.\n\nHere are the red flags I chose to ignore or put together later:\n\n1. When we first met things were amazing, he didn\u2019t buy me gifts or shower me with expensive things or anything but he was very loving and adventurous and spontaneous, he told me more than once he never felt this comfortable around anyone and no one had ever made him feel this good about himself. He said he loved me. I felt it too though, or I thought I did. He bought me plane tickets to come visit him, paid for hotels, etc etc. \n\n2. Then the cheating started a few months later. He cheated on me constantly and I forgave him (shameful, I know). He lied about it. He would say he wasn\u2019t cheating but then some girl would post on his Facebook and show they were together that night and he would not even try to hide it. He would text me that he loved me and I was the one and then at the same time text another girl he was seeing and same thing (long story on how I found this out but I won\u2019t get into that). \n\n3. His actions never matched with his words. \n\n4. Throughout our relationship he would \u201cdisappear\u201d sometimes for up to 5 days without a text or a phone call. And meanwhile I would be texting him. He would just ignore it. I don\u2019t know if it was because he didn\u2019t give a damn or if it was because he was playing some game? At first he would make excuses, work, etc. then he would just ignore my inquires and avoid the question as to why he hadn\u2019t responded. Honestly he did his up until the end of our relationship. I am guessing because was chatting up other women and I wasn\u2019t a priority anymore.\n\n4. He started making me feel bad about myself, about what I wore, he told me I embarrassed him in front of this friends. How I acted. Told me I wore too much makeup. He even told his cousin a complete lie (my first time meeting his cousin) and said I had hooked up with his friend (I didn\u2019t). It completely embarrassed me even though it wasn\u2019t true, when I confronted him and asked why he did that, he said he wanted to see what his cousin would say and didn\u2019t seem to think it was a mean thing to do, just completely brushed it off and seemed annoyed I confronted him. This wasn\u2019t a constant thing and he only did stuff like this occasionally maybe a handful of times but each time it deeply hurt my feelings. He wasn\u2019t constantly mean or anything. \n\n5. I found out later, after the fact that the girl he had been cheating on me with became pregnant, I found out that he left her, that he skipped out and tried to fake a DNA test to avoid taking responsibility. Upon confrontation he said it wasn\u2019t his, he said it was some other guys and she was trying to pin it on him. He ghosted her and blocked her too, cut her off completely after lying to her trying to make the relationship work. I Found out after he last discarded me he always kept tabs on her social media, years later, because it probably was his child all along. Why else would he keep tabs? I had no idea until he ghosted me and I was digging through his social media. \n**funny thing about that long before we started dated I heard though the grapevine he could have an illegitimate child with ANOTHER girl. This was a rumor I didn\u2019t know if it was true but looking back it might. When asked about he denied it. Too bad his new girl friend will never know about this. \n\n6. He ghosted me 3 times in total. The first time it was for a month. He came back, said he had made a mistake, I fell for it. The second time he ghosted me around my college graduation, his excuse was he thought I could do better than him he said he was suicidal and he didn\u2019t know who he was. I bought it, not sure if it was true but we talked about it and agreed to work it out. The third time, this last disappearance, while he doesn\u2019t know it \u201cbecause he doesn\u2019t believe in anniversaries unless it\u2019s marriage\u201d we were on our 6 year anniversary, officially. \n\n7. He always had extremely low self esteem, about his physical appearance especially. He was always worried about what people thought of him. He wouldn\u2019t even take his shirt of in a public pool/beach. And he didn\u2019t have a bad body. \n\n8. Towards the end of our relationship he no longer wanted to have sex, probably because he either wasn\u2019t attracted to me anymore or because he was talking to this other girl.\n\n9. I caught him on tinder a month before he ghosted me the third time (he got a notification on his phone) and he lied and said he didn\u2019t use it) \n\n10. A few months before he finally ghosted me he would get extremely emotional if someone didn\u2019t agree with him or even if they did agree with him he would rarely let them get a word in and would just get extremely emotional to the point of tears sometimes. He was never violent though. Not just toward me though, towards everyone including his family.\n\n11. My friends who observed him said he never listened to anyone\u2019s opinion but the truth is I never really noticed until the end of our relationship when I couldn\u2019t get a single word in. \n\n12. Lastly, the biggest red flag I chose to ignore was his history with other people, a lot of them which I know personally. He has skipped out/disappeared/ghosted EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN HIS LIFE. Even several ex girlfriends that I personally know. He did it to his own parents for 10 months one time. Just cut all communication off. I know... it sounds crazy but I thought I was different. How? I am beating myself up over that tremendously. He never keeps people around in his life, friends, lovers, etc. he ghosts them all. With lovers specifically he usually jumps to the next girl quickly. When he started dating me he had been talking to this girl a whole year prior and he just dumped her off and moved onto me. Ignored her texts/calls, etc. I remember asking him why at the time and he just said he didn\u2019t see a future with her and that he didn\u2019t know why he felt that way suddenly, it was like something just clicked. But the one thing about his behavior that is consistent, is if he doesn\u2019t reach out to you and come back to you, he always keeps tabs on you, but he usually does come back to \u201cmake amends\u201d. Eventually. I guess it makes him feel better? \n\n13. He never had to courage to sit down and talk to people about what he is feeling. He has never actually broken up with someone, he just leaves. \n\n14. He changed toward the middle/end of our relationship. He was no longer adventurous/spontaneous. He became overly paranoid. He always thought and brought up the worst that could happen every time I suggested something. It was like pulling teeth to get him to do anything adventurous, go swimming, hiking, traveling, anything. \n\n15. Stories/memories we had when we reminisced and talked about that were once funny at the time, he would change them and it gave him an opportunity to turn them into stories to be upset with me for for something I did. \n\n16. Toward the end my trust in him waivered. He told me he didn\u2019t feel like I was on his side anymore. \n\n17. He committed fraud once to get out of paying for something he had committed to paying for. \n\n18. Our whole relationship I felt like I was the one giving. He was taking. He never compromised. It was always me adapting he always put himself first. He never wanted to live with me, never wanted to commit. He only saw himself and wanted he wanted to do, while he talked about including me in his plans and we talked about our future a lot, marriage, kids, we had long conversations about making a life together, it almost felt real but in the end he never took any action to do any of those things after many opportunities. \n\n19. He was never around, I was always just living my life and doing things without him. \n\n20. He never came out and said it but I think he was hurt that I went on this work assignment in another state because of some passive aggressive comments he made, But he never asked me to stay. Not once. And I was tired of waiting for him to commit. \n\nI know what you\u2019re thinking... \n\nI should have seen it coming. Bottom line is he is a selfish coward (insert a bunch of 4 letter words). But I was young and stupid, still am stupid apparently, \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f and he was so affectionate in the beginning and even throughout the relationship I just didn\u2019t. I put rose colored glasses on and ignored everything bad about him. Even after feeling so hurt and helpless after he wasn\u2019t loyal to me. \n\nSo these questions have filled my head, over the last 3 months... did he ever love me? Does he have the capacity to love? Did he ever care? Did he actually care about me but just get tired of me and repress his guilt/feelings of remorse over what he\u2019s done and bury it in this other new girl? Is he going to get sick of this new girl (yes, probably because he hasn\u2019t changed himself he has just changed women), is he ever going to try to reach out to me again even after blocking me? Why block me after 3 months of not talking why would he care if I saw his new girlfriend or did he want me to see her? Is that why he made his profile public? Is it some sort of game? Am I thinking way to deep into this? \n\nNot only do I have these questions about him but also to myself, I have been asking myself why didn\u2019t you see this? Why did you stay so long? I am disappointed in myself, my lack of judgment, my inability to stop thinking about him and somehow missing him? I feel crazy. \n\nI hung onto every word he said every fake promise he made. Even though none of his words/actions added up. And I let him string me along, I held myself hostage for 6 years holding onto false hope because I was afraid to lose the good parts of him. \n\nAgain this is all the bad stuff that happened. We had good times, many good times, I felt so comfortable with him, we were great friends, we could laugh and appeared we could talk about anything. We did a lot together, in the beginning. But as you can see the bad eventually outweighed the good. I made excuses for all the bad that he did because I wanted to believe that he was a good person. He proved me wrong. \n\nSo, in your experience based on the above \u201cred flags\u201d is he really a covert narcissist? \n\nIs all this narcissistic abuse? Or did I just bring it on myself for being codependent and putting up with it for so long? \n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Please don\u2019t judge, I\u2019m trying to find ways to handle my emotions properly especially when I\u2019m around my dad. Ever since my siblings and I were young, my parents would fight... and it\u2019s not just your \u2018typical\u2019 argument where you\u2019d resolve things and go back to loving one another, it was the type of arguments and fights that affected you growing up. Let me just give you a bit of a background here, my father has been dealing with cancer for about 5-6 years now. He\u2019s been okay health wise, but emotionally/mentally he\u2019s just been out of control.... it\u2019s been like this ever since I was younger like I said earlier but I feel like he gets to excuse himself from his shitty actions and words because he\u2019s sick. He\u2019s going to die soon. He has nothing left. these are all words that come from my mother who deals with it all and I feel SO horrible and it makes me sick. My dad is very very VERY emotionally abusive towards my mom, and every time I butt in he will go ape shit and tell me to move out because he isn\u2019t the one speaking to me, and of course he isn\u2019t speaking directly to me but how would you feel if your dad was gaslighting your own mother right in front of you? Maybe some of you are better at holding onto your emotions and words than me, but I know my mom doesn\u2019t deserve this. We can\u2019t move out to leave my dad because 1. I work a part time job and I\u2019m still in school 2. If we end up finding a way to leave my dad, he would wind up either threatening my mom with death OR giving his siblings (my aunts/uncles) a sob story that isn\u2019t even true. I need help. I need advice because I\u2019m just so angry at him all. the. time. He doesn\u2019t even let my mom talk on the phone with her sister who is also dealing with cancer, he hates when she goes out to do GROCERY SHOPPING with her own family. He\u2019s told me once before when I got medicated for an infection to just take all my pills to die.

Any ideas?", "author": "ElEcTrIcAtsHoooo", "self_text": "A very nice person asked me to post my story here, because it would be a good place to maybe find the answers I need! \n\n26F, USA. I am currently in an 8 year relationship, which I feel like I gave my all in. I did everything I know to be a 'perfect partner'. I stay home when I'm not working, I cook and clean, I don't really ask for anything to keep me happy, since I am pretty easy to please. We have a son together, and with no family support things haven't been easy (but manageable). \n\nI have come to realize that I gave so much of myself that I almost lost myself (self- identity) due to overworking myself and also being a mom. My partner has only been pretty much a financial sponsor, he believes if he pays the majority of the bills then he can do as he pleases. Which means no help with anything else. Motherhood, taking care of the home and pets, etc. All while I have a full time job as well (farm work so it is very physically demanding). He literally does nothing to help me, and would rather literally sit in his chair and watch me do everything.\n\nToo many things have piled up over the years, with lies and gaslighting, to emotional abuse/ neglect. Never physical, though. He is a good person deep down (we've known each other since we were kids), but this isn't what I want anymore. I feel like I deserve to have an equal partner, and deserve someone one day that will respect me and not simply use me for a 'good time' and for the convenience of a housemaid and nanny. I deserve someone I can give all of my love to and not suffer so much. I'm so broken over my relationship, but I am also ready to move on. By moving on, I mean with my own life and not into another relationship for a long time. I know relationships aren't anything to rush into for sure now lol! \n\nFinances of course prevent me from doing this. I have a full time job, but only make $9 hourly and I was forced to stop my college education due to pregnancy at the time (no family support), so I don't have any degrees. I was so close to getting my RN degree, but unfortunately life happened. I wouldn't trade it for anything though, since my son is my everything! He really taught me how to be a better person. \n\nAll of my money goes into our family vehicles (I pay 2 vehicle payments and insurance for both). He pays for everything else. His vehicle costs so much, but he refuses to compromise and even though it sounds silly probably, I did say at one time that I felt he deserved a new vehicle and that I would do my best to get him one as a love gift (this was before I found out about all of the things he hid from me). To me a promise is a promise, and my word is my bond. Not only that, but I cant just leave my son's father without a way to go to work just because I'm unhappy in our relationship. That would only end up hurting my son in the long run, and I will do whatever I can to prevent that. He is young right now (4 years old), so he doesn't have the mental capacity to really understand what all is going on. \n\nAs far as my son is concerned, he knows nothing. We make sure we never discuss adult matters around him, and we make sure to get along when he is home. We feel as though a child should only worry about child things, and not be burdened by adult matters. We have been very successful so far. He is always so happy, cheerful, and full of love. \n\nWe have already discussed our relationship problems with each other, but about 4 months ago I found out he has been in the backrooms at the nearest strip club. I honestly dont know what all goes on back there, but from what he has said, it wasnt anything he should have been getting into. He did confess that to me. I told him he had a choice- I could leave then, or I could leave when we pay off everything we have together (about 4 years max) . I said that after everything I have went through to try to make our relationship the best it could be, to pay another woman to give him the attention that I desperately wanted to give and get in return, was the worst kind of insult. It hurt me so much, and I did not understand at all why he would intentionally make the choice to hurt me if he loved me. He has also lied in the past about talking to other girls. But he has absolutely zero time for me- he is never home other than to relax before bed and to be in and out, making messes everywhere for me to clean up. I'm so tired. I'm so tired of being tired. And used. \n\nI want to get done with paying these things off ASAP so I can leave and try to establish myself anew, but it's so hard to do that when I have no family (abusive parent that I haven't spoken to in years,  and most of my relatives are deceased, including my other parent). All I have is myself, and of course I will have to support my son as well, since his father won't be able to take him to and from school because of his work schedule. I do all of that before and after my job currently. \n\nI have tried to google companies that will hire people based on merit, since that's all I've really got right now, but nothing fruitful has turned up. I live in a rural area, which makes it super hard to find any kind of job! All I need is a chance and I know I could make an employer very happy. I work hard and I learn really fast! I love to do a good job, and I never miss work unless I'm physically unable to (last year I had to miss one week of work, but only because I had the stomach virus and couldn't physically work). My job currently is 6 days a week, 8 hours a day or more depending on what all needs to be done that day. \n\nI love my job and everyone I work with, but what i really need is a retirement plan and benefits, and of course an income that will allow me to be independent. I'm getting older, and I need to start on some kind of plan soon so I can retire in a timely fashion. I know I probably won't find anything like that, though, with my current aspects that I have to offer. I'm really not picky with what work I do, as long as there is work for me to do! I like to stay busy. \n\nBasically what I want to ask is would anyone know of anything I may could do in the meantime, or a point in a general direction to start? I have tons of customer service experience, and I even used to be a technical support person for a while. I was even a shift manager for a little while at a restaurant. It's just really hard to find a job that I could maybe do in my area. It's more about who you know than what you know here, and unfortunately I don't know much of anyone. \n\nAll I want in life is to be a good mom, a good worker, and make enough money to support my son and I. I don't need a lot at all to make me happy! Just the essentials. \n\nWould anyone have any tips for me? Anything is appreciated! \n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'll definitely work on myself to never repeat this behaviour, but unfortunately it will not be together with my soon-to-be-ex \u2013 a friend found his profile on Tinder, and that, coupled with everything else, is the last straw. I'm getting out of this relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my first time posting to this subreddit, sorry if I do anything wrong. I'd really like some help, and this seems like the perfect place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, a little backstory \u2013 my boyfriend \\[27M\\] and I \\[26F\\] have been together for \\~1.5 years, and the first year of our relationship was great, fun, full of love, with just a few minor disagreements here and there. However, last summer he had to switch jobs and encountered some family and financial problems, while I got promoted to a demanding position and also applied to grad school. I realise now that we didn't know how to deal with the stress, and that put extreme pressure on our relationship (hindsight is 20/20), but recently it occurred to me that it's been six months of awful fights, more recently at least once a week, and it's only getting worse.\n\nDuring our last fight he called me a bunch of names and accused me of being abusive to him. We couldn't resolve the fight, he left, but what he said stuck in my head and I started researching it... And I've got to say, I feel like crap now because I had never thought of it, but so many of the signs can be applied to our relationship.\n\nHere are some examples of what has happened during the last 6 months:\n\n* Name-calling \u2013 I have called him mean, uncaring, cold and selfish a lot of times. A few times he has called me a b\\*tch, an idiot and a monster. I have apologised afterwards, he has said he regrets it but didn't apologise.\n* Jealousy \u2013 I have lashed out and accused him of cheating when he is texting all the time and refuses to say who with, or he goes out on Friday and disappears until Saturday afternoon. He has shown up without warning when I meet up with my friends and blown up my phone with messages like \"Can't you really come out for a few minutes? Is he (friend I'm meeting) more important to you?\" until I step outside to see him or cut my evening short.\n* Silent treatment \u2013 this has become his favorite way to end our conflicts; he walks out and ignores me for days, whether I text, call or do nothing. I have blocked the exit and refused to physically let him leave a few times because of this.\n* The blame game \u2013 I blame him because his actions make me feel horrible and hurt, and at least half the time I'm the one who starts the conversation by talking about how I feel, which then turns into a fight. He blames me, saying his actions are just a reaction to my actions (which are a reaction to his actions...), and so on. It feels like a never-ending circle.\n* Mood swings \u2013 I often go from angry to sweet in a few minutes, when I manage to calm down during a fight, and then back to angry if he tries to continue the fight. He often goes from attentive and loving to distant and cold in a second if I say something that rubs him the wrong way.\n* Physical fighting \u2013 this has only happened once. We were driving home, he was in a mood and tried to pick a fight, so I asked him to please let me out. He didn't. I asked again and again, until I was panicked and screaming bloody murder to stop the car, but he just ignored me and kept driving. I pulled his hat off to try and make him acknowledge me, and accidentally hit him. I jumped out at an intersection and walked the 30 minutes home, and when I got home he was so mad he pushed me. I pushed back, he grabbed me and threw me on the ground, and that's it. He refused to apologise for it because \"I hurt him too, so we're equal\", even though I did apologise.\n\nSomehow I can only recognize these behaviours after the fact, I never seem to realise what's happening when it is *actually* happening. A part of me feels that he's right, I'm abusive, and our relationship deteriorating is my fault.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I abusive to him?

And there will be times when the abuser doesn't invalidate you, and they may even support you, but I can't help but believe it's just another level of control, another way to say \"hey, I did these good things, it excuses my abusive bahavioir\".\n\nI'm currently dealing with cutting out an abusive person from my life, and I noticed that they frequently try and draw me back in by trying to invalidate how I feel, or invalidate the actions of others who have acused them of abuse. Very commonly they would dismiss my feelings of insecurity and jealousy, blow me off when I needed support, tell me I was being rude if I questioned their actions. Any time I tried to genuinely confront the abusive behaviour, I would be rejected and dismissed. And this is what I keep reminding myself of every time they try and contact me. I confront their behaviour, and they always try and deflect it in some way.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

One minute, I'm the love of his life. The next, I'm the reason all bad things happened to him. He blocks me then unblocks me. Turns off my phone then turns it back on...\n\nSince we have a daughter, I've been trying to be very delicate dealing with him. I've been giving him very small amounts of hope in an attempt to keep him happy so that I don't have to deal with his rage. And it had been working, if mildly. \n\nHe's been confessing to long-time lies. Telling me all the ways he tried to manipulate and hurt me. Even swearing he doesn't want to be a narcissist, doesn't want to hurt people. So I gave him the number to a psychologist who specializes in personality disorders. Nex claims to have contacted him and said his first appointment is Thursday. Whether or not I believe him is a different matter entirely...\n\nAnyway. Things were going more smoothly finally but then I messed up somehow, and he went off the rails on me the other day while at my house. Took my phone, deleted our conversation history, dropped it, kicked it, threaten to leave with our daughter...\n\nAs soon as he left, I recovered the texts, blocked him everywhere, and submitted a form for child support. I told him I was never meeting him in private again and we'd have to go through lawyers for supervised visitation rights. I felt good. He was able to contact me via email but I was standing my ground. I wasn't going to let him abuse me again. \n\nBut of course, he tricked me. Emailed and said he needed to go to the hospital. So I called him. He said he'd taken a bunch of pills but threw them up so no need to call an ambulance. The next day he kept saying he has no reason to live and I don't care so just leave him alone. \n\nSomehow we got to talking about the one time in our relationship where things were good. Two months out of an entire year. And I said that was the best time of our relationship. He swore he could get back there, he just needed a little hope. In an attempt to give him so that he'd quit threatening suicide (because I honestly believe he'd do it after so long), I told him I can't even think of getting back with him until he goes to at least two therapy sessions with the psychologist. Because I know he won't actually go to two appointments. And better believe, if he claims to, I WILL make him give the psychologist permission to talk to me and hear from him how things are going. \n\nBut apparently that was the green light my nex needed... Because he's been love bombing me ever since. And while it's great to hear it all, after all this time, him finally recognizing how good to him I actually was... \n\nI feel so gross... And so, so weak. He abused me for a year. A year... And I'm just letting him believe there's a chance we'll get back together. All I wanted was peace. All I wanted was for him to learn how to be a dad and to spend normal time with our daughter. All I wanted was for him to get help -- for him and for her, not for me. \n\nBut now the train is moving again, and I don't know how to get off. I don't want to get back with him. Even if he *could* fix himself. Because there's still so much about him as a person that I don't like and don't want in a partner. I love him as a human... But I'm not IN love with him. \n\nAnd now I'm stuck again. I fell for his tricks, and I feel so, so stupid... I should've just held my ground. I should've never called him, just called 911 and moved on. And I feel so gross... Every time he tells me he loves me, I get nauseous. Every time he talks about sex, I feel violated. But I play along to keep the peace. I don't know how to tell him to stop without all the drama starting up again. I don't know how to get away.\n\nAny advice? I'm in new territory for me. Knowing he's not what I want, but not knowing how to communicate that to him without my life turning into chaos... Ugh... Please be gentle...", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Today I am so much stronger but today I am still fighting for my life back from this horrific experience- today is not easy but today is so much easier- I am writing my first post as a decision to give back to communities which helped me to survive and thrive- \n\nA very brief summary of my relationship which followed the classic pattern of idealisation / devaluation with consistent intermittent love/ discard - \nI met my ex partner in a roller derby team- we shared sport and exercises- she is very competitive, so I am- straight away there was the love bombing, constant texting until 3am all day all night- she was so smiley and kind and nice etc .... god I melted- she hunted me - she made the moves - I learned she was seeing someone else which she lied about initially- I told her I was not interested to have a relationship with her in this kind of format- she apparently dumped her ex the same day- I never asked details- she told me her insecurities ( like she never lived with a partner) and I told her mine ( do never do that!!!) \nThere were problems with red flags from the start ( we moved in together after 4 months because she never lived with a partner and I wanted to give her that, we struggled with her pushing financial boundaries all the time- after a month living together I felt so drained- I had to reinforce boundaries all the time - she wanted to invest in my property even before moving in- there were hundreds of incidents over 2 years and 4 months with money and they were crazy stories-\nHer rages started with Brexit in U.K.- at the start of our relationship- she exploded at me in public - my friends asked what I did - I was in such a state, I was thinking of all the things I possibly could have said/ done in the day without success- my heart was bumping of self doubt of that rage- her, she continued like nothing had happened, smiling and courteous to people- today, I understand that was her first rage directed at me ( her true self without the mask) and I will experience many others over the months, which will self sabotage my self confidence- Survivors, you need to listen to your intuitions, you must reflect /pause on red flags- i knew this wasn\u2019t normal but I continued because I didn\u2019t pause long enough to reflect -\nShe gaslighted me, use projection, shouted at me and then loved me all over again - she was a covert manipulator- she criticised my friends and tried to be on my side when I had issues- sometimes she will just put me down for nothing with a cruel remark- every time we had highs, I knew I was going to receive a rage- I was tiptoeing in my flat- I was scared of her not sleeping well and getting a grumpy episode the next day- she was complaining about how I was moving at night in bed, kicking her in my sleep with my legs- to try to avoid conflict, I slept at times on the floor, also slept in sleeping bag in our bed to restrain my legs, offered to attach my legs with a belt ( which she refused) and we spent \u00a31400 on a new tempur mattress ( we went to the shop with a ping pong ball - she asked me to jump in mattresses to see if the ball was moving )- of course today I see that everything is madness-and I just wanted to avoid drama and bad mood- and I was ready to do a lot of things- survivors, the first thing people need to understand is that whatever you do, that will never change the dynamic or the way they react/ order/ make you feel- maybe, i wasn\u2019t even moving in bed, who knows- she also often kicked me in bed with her legs if I was over the 50% of the bed on her side- always reminded me that was her side, with tracing a line on the sheet- like kids-\n\nI am going to jump to the discard episode - but by this time I had endured mild physical abuse, consistent psychological, emotional, verbal,financial abuse -my body had reactions ( I thought I became intolerant to lactose as I had severe flatulences - when she left, I stopped having those and returned to my normal - it was my guts responding to stress)- again, survivors, listen to what your body is telling you-\nSo often, I will reinforce my boundaries and often she will push more on any things ( calling name, animal sounds, sex demands, triangulation etc ....)- we also went to therapy once, where she shouted at the therapist and didn\u2019t talk to me for days as a punishment ( stonewalling)-\nThe grande finale, as some people call it:\nThe day before she screamed at me on the street ( I told her I was going home as she was grumpy with me and she suffered a narcissist injury so then she screamed), then kissed me and told me she loved me- we made love few times- the next day we were going to a big wedding in a very posh venue- her friend was getting married- she sat far away from me on the bus and sent me a text telling me how sexy I was- We got there and initially it was ok- we made love at the wedding - I didn\u2019t see anything coming - then she left with some of her friends ( harem) outdoor - when they were back, a friend tapped her gently on the back like something was wrong- I should I known - my intuitions- I could tell but I discarded my  instinct- I was talking to a friend of hers at the round table where we were sitting - she came behind me and in front of everybody, told me that she wanted me to leave and I wasn\u2019t welcome to stay anymore- with 10 of her friends, they escorted me in a lift- I didn\u2019t say a word- I felt so drained and humiliated- she was smiling, I could tell- one of her male friends said in French to me \u201c adieu\u201d ( I am French) - so cruel - I took a bus ( I had crunches and a moon boot) and went home, put the chain on and went to be exhausted- \nShe whispered at me at the wedding  that she won\u2019t come back that night ( which she denied later )- because I didn\u2019t text or made a fuss, I am assuming that it was another injury to her- also I assume that she did what she did because I told her before the wedding that I will go back home if I felt uncomfortable- another injury to her - it wasn\u2019t meant to be a threat just a fact communicated of my needs - \nThat night she came back - didn\u2019t call me- just got back home- because there was the chain on, she consistently ringed the bell -non stop for 15 minutes at 1am- I called her name but she didn\u2019t reply- I took the fuses off - then she knocked at the door with fury for so long- I took off the chain- she came in so violently, screaming - went back upstairs- I told her to go- I was scared- I threw her bag on the stairs- she used that against me at a later stage as in her bag was a laptop which the screen was damaged when I threw the bag- she made me pass as the abuser with pictures of her broken screen- she pushed me on the floor despite my injury and the moon boot , saying I was playing the victim-\nI begged her to leave- I said I will call the police- she took my phone and called herself the police telling them I wasn\u2019t letting her leave the property- \nShe didn\u2019t wait for the police , and I had to deal with that on my own- \n2 days later on, she moved out, went to live 5 minutes away- \nThen she told me that her work gave her an exceptional week off from work when they saw her bruises- she basically made me pass for her abuser- told people that I did bruises on her- she sent me a picture of her bruises on her arms ( when she knocked at the door)  - you should have seen her face, her eyes, so scary- later on she told me that she never called the police - really scary, the gaslighting had no limit- \n\nThen I endured 3/4 months of hoovering - never said sorry- tried to be friend but was even more abusive as before- there were no more limits now- she was triangulating me non stop (all the people she was meeting, having sex with) she made crazy story how I gave her chlamydia ( I did some tests and I was clean)- she rejected me even more- we didn\u2019t have any more sex since the discard - she was coming back at times telling me how much she missed me, loved me etc ..... to leave again and abused me verbally even more- \nIt was a total nightmare - until I realised that it will never get better- I will never see the girl I used to love, because that girl didn\u2019t exist- \nToday I am on a 4 months non contact - she is going to the choir opposite my house, she moved 5 min walk away- last time I bumped into her in a cabaret, I ignored her- I could see the narcissistic injury in her eyes- \nI blocked her, unfriended her from social media- \nShe tried to poke me with weird things where again she wanted a reaction from me- I never gave any-\n\nToday it is still hard- knowing what happened, being single, missing her, knowing she doesn\u2019t even reflect about anything about it, knowing she rebuilt her life without consequences etc ....but the only thing I can promise is non contact is my only pride in that crazy experience-\n\n\nMy first problems when the discard happened, was I didn\u2019t understand what happened - I couldn\u2019t believe what she did, publicly to humiliate me-I didn\u2019t know a thing about abuse, narcissistic personality disorder and borderline personality disorder- nothing- when we hear \u201c knowledge is power\u201d there is a voice here- also I couldn\u2019t comprehend the thought that it was possible for a human being to want to harm a loved one on purpose- so my first problem was confusion and lack of knowledge- also I was ashamed because I am a woman and my ex partner is a woman too- I have heard of men abusing women, not women abusing women- I was scared of no one believing me: I am a strong and fierce woman ( but very empath and caring), I am quite loud, I have tattoos on my arms and I am quite androgynous looking- my ex partner looks like an angel, she has this pretty face with angelic blue eyes, she is very charismatic and charming- when people meet her, they will all be drown to her- It took me over a month to call domestic violence helpline because I thought nobody will believe my version- when I called them , they straight away told me I was \u201c classic textbook\u201d- and today I know better because of all the books I read about that issue- narcissists are often highly intelligent ( mine has a PHD ) and charismatic- \nMy other immediate problem was validation - As I said, I was really puzzled and violated about what happened to me and I talked about it as I felt so grieved- I talked to my colleagues ( some were very supportive, some were like \u201c you? You don\u2019t look like the victim profile) I talked to my friends ( again some were very supportive, some got bored quickly, some didn\u2019t understand, some responded with insensitive responses such as \u201c really? \u201c \u201c I can\u2019t see this in her\u201d)- \nSo I realised quickly that narcissistic disorder wasn\u2019t very well known except if you have experienced this type of abuse- thanks to some of my friends, I got support from domestic violence hotline which validated what had happened to me- also they put me in contact with charities which deals with this- I have had the chance to receive 2 types of therapies- one for group women survivor (this was a straight environment so often the mediator was referring as HE/HIM for the perpetrator which she tried to change at times in regards for my experience that my abuser was a woman) and I am still receiving 1-1 therapy linked to domestic abuse and it is a gay charity- so I would like to reinforce here to all survivors that therapy has been amazing support to me: to talk , to be validated, to vent , a space as well where i can miss her and that\u2019s ok- \n\nI have read a lot of books on NPD, BPD , abuse, and also lots of books on self care ( shahida Arabi for example is priceless so I would like to thank you personally for your material support about NPD) I went to forums of survivors, watched videos on you tube etc ....  if you struggle on your journey, I find this very helpful- I found that understanding that it was not about me, that I was certainly chosen because I was strong ( opposite to weak as I initially thought she believed) and I had lots of empathy ( caring, fixing , co- dependency etc ...). Also every time I have a struggle with NC, I read a chapter and it was sufficient to remember what I was facing , also it helped with cognitive dissonance, and reminded my true story -\n\nIn my journey, I also entered a 4 pages comic competition which I did about BPD and my story on the abuse- I didn\u2019t win but I am very proud of doing so- I gave a copy to all my friends, again to validate what happened to me- I am considering writing a bigger comic book about it as my knowledge now is much more expanded and I know it was also NPD- I might attach here my first comic which was written mainly using texts messages she sent me with her consistent contact by text messages-\n\nI continued going to the gym, and turned my focus on my self recovery-( of course the first thing I did when I was horrifically discarded was buy a bottle of wine and a packet of cigarettes despite I quit 2 years before that)- the idea is not to be hard on you, but instead to accept the stages of recovery- the gym and my focus on my body has helped a lot- which of course relieves the dopamines- \nI also attend a yoga class a week, which again has been a life saver- the deep relaxation at the end of each session ... the chant, the bang .... \nI am considering also to give myself a \u00a31 for every good thing i am giving myself to myself , to be grateful for the things i do for myself and my recovery -\nI also have new friends- some are survivors, some I met on dating sites ( of course I wasn\u2019t ready and not sure I am today just yet ) - I also managed to try to sort out some issues I had in my family over this Christmas- I really tried to understand why I endured that level of abuse for 2 years and I realised apart from the trauma bonding every survivor experienced, I also receive some abuse in my childhood and that made me more tolerant to abuse- and I was the one often apologising despite being the receiver of the abuse- Melanie Tonia Evans I think goes into that direction : find your inner self , your insecurities- \nEvery time I miss my ex, I remind myself that I miss \u201cme\u201d. \nI am also trying to use positive affirmations and thinking about writing them on a black board in my kitchen -\n\nSo here I am, 8 months post break up, 4 months post NC- it is easier but I am still struggling with ruminating about her, our life together, what she did - I am sure that she already moved on with partners when I am still \u201c stuck\u201d with the experience- but I have to believe that my self recovery is for the best and the long term- that if I do all of that, I want to believe that something good will come out of this- \n\nToday I can see red flags- I am positive- I could maintain NC ( despite the ruminations but I am working on this with mindfulness and meditation)- \n\nI visualise a good future where \u201cme \u201cis at the core of it- there is no fixing someone else- because you can\u2019t fix anyone else except you, and that\u2019s the only control you have in life- \n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I asked him what he\u2019s looking for and he doesn\u2019t hesitate to say he\u2019s looking for something serious, for a woman to move in with him and help out with his kids and help him \u201cthrive\u201d at his work that he\u2019s looking to get married. I was taken back by this and told him I want to take things slow and he tells me he understands and can\u2019t wait to meet me. One day his \u201cmask\u201d cracked and I saw the real him for a moment, this sweet kind man turned egotistical, self absorbed,  and  obnoxious when he mentioned how many matches he had, how many women are after him and that I need to tell them to stay away. I saw the real him and I immediately was triggered I told him goodbye and I was seriously never going to text him again. But then I was overflowed with sweet texts, and telling me how much respect he has for me, that it was a misunderstanding to give him another chance to finally meet him. And I was fooled, he tricked me, I met with him and it all went downhill from there. Our first date was nothing I\u2019ve experienced before, he was extremely composed, calm, relaxed almost like he\u2019s done this a thousand times. He continues to text me and call me baby and talk about this future he already sees with me. Our second date I really start to like him , I open up to him about my abusive ex and he consoles me tells me \u201cI\u2019ve never been abusive in my life\u201d \u201cI have definitely learned to value a woman\u201d he takes me to a bar and orders me multiple drinks which I willingly drink but he starts getting overly touchy and mentions he\u2019s getting me\u201dloosened up and it\u2019s working\u201d even the lady at the bar told him \u201cwhat are you trying to get her drunk that\u2019s not good\u201d and he just laughs. He takes me back to his house and we have sex. He made me trust him, he made me feel comfortable he knew exactly what to tell me and I fell for it. On my way home after that I just felt sick to my stomach, something didn\u2019t feel right I felt like my intuitions, my subconscious were screaming why why why and what a mistake that was. I ignored his texts and he proceeds to text me sweet things again tells me to not worry that he still respects me and that what I gave him was a gift. I fall for it again and we\u2019re texting day and night he\u2019s telling me how much he likes me and how he wants to introduce me to his kids soon and our third date happens, at this point we\u2019re holding hands and kissing and I\u2019m really starting to like him, during our dinner he mentions that he would call his ex names and that he was unfaithful to her but that he\u2019s learned from that and that he\u2019s a better person. My heart drops and I start panicking inside. After that, I noticed more red flags, he said the toll bridge lady was a bitch because the toll was $6 today instead of $5. He laughed at a television show and described this lady a \u201cfat bitch\u201d and thought that was humorous. He tells me am I done being \u201ca brat\u201d because I wanted to stay up later with him that night. But even with those red flags I decided to ignore them. I liked him too much already and he knew it...after our last date he gives a hug and a kiss and tells me he\u2019ll text me later. Two hours later he texts me \u201chow amazing and beautiful\u201d I was but that\u201d I just want to be friends\u201d my stomach turned and my skin burned and my throat tightened and I felt betrayed. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I bawled my eyes out and felt worthless at that point I gave my body to him, I opened up to him, and he was not the man I thought he was. I finally text him back and I tell him he knew exactly what he was doing, he took advantage of my kindness, he just used me for sex, that everything about him was probably a lie. That\u2019s when his entire mask fell off the real evil, narcissistic, abusive, angry man started calling me a stupid fucking bitch, that I should\u2019ve known this would happen, that we were just doing what adults do, that I don\u2019t fucking know him and to fuck off he even went as far as to tell me \u201cI\u2019m an instigator that\u2019s why my last relationship was so crazy\u201d basically telling me I deserved the abuse. I seriously wanted to jump off a bridge and just end my life. I even drove there just to see how big the bridge was, because I feel so worthless I feel like he\u2019s right in some way that I deserve abuse that I\u2019m just not good enough. This is the second time I\u2019ve been treated with such cruelty and disrespect and I ignored all of the signs and I look back and see them all now. I have a psychiatrist appointment tomorrow and I will admit that I\u2019m having suicidal thoughts. I deleted my tinder account and i took a day off work. All I hope and pray for is to be whole again and to recover and heal from this. This is not what I needed after going through three years of abuse.

I listened to you talk about the people in your life that you seemed to not be able to get away from and who gave you stress. \n\nI was there on your 27th birthday as you lay in your bed sobbing about how you were a failure and were going nowhere with your life. I held your hand and I held you and I told you that it was going to be ok, that you were 27 now yeah but that you had so many years ahead of you and that I wasn\u2019t going to let you fall down and be a failure \u2026 that I was going to do all I could to help you. I promised myself I would work even harder to make you feel loved. I told myself I would speak less about what hurt me because right now in life with all that you were going through it was fine if you took center stage for a while and I took a backseat.\n\nI was there when you accused me of cheating on you when I asked where Bobby was. I listened to your insecurities when you got mad at me for not immediately responding to you or answering your calls. I knew you had been hurt in the past and I wanted to be there for you and be so unlike all those other selfish assholes you had dated in the past.\n\nI was there. I was there for you when I found out you had been talking to numerous other guys. I chose to stay after finding out you had shared dick pics with the person that we saw as one of the greatest threats to our relationship. I chose to forgive you for talking to the men on Craigslist and believed you when you told me that you did it because I was the problem and that I didn\u2019t understand you and that I wasn\u2019t there.\n\nI was there when you screamed at me and put your hands around my neck and left bruises. I was there when you threw me around and snatched me by my arms like a ragdoll and dug your fingers into my sweater ripping the collar apart \u2026 as I laid crying on the living room floor as you told me what a piece of shit I was and how no one else would ever want me. I cried for your pain when you held a knife to yourself and told me that you wanted to die and how dare I say that I had had enough and give up on you \u2026 when you told me that you bet I was happy because now I had finally got what I always wanted. I was there when you told me I was never there.\n\nI was there for myself. As I sat up in bed, stood up, put my clothes on, told you that this moment was one of the hardest in my life, and told you that I would always love you for the rest of my life as I looked at you one last time and then closed the door behind me and screamed at my feet to keep moving across the living room, down the stairs, and into my car as I drove away. \n\nI\u2019m here, but can\u2019t quite seem to find me anymore. but I know I\u2019m somewhere.\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I am torn and can\u2018t really figure out with myself if what I experienced actually plays part in how I behave now.\nThanks to everyone in advance who takes the time reading and/or responding.\n\nTL;DR at the end of the text.\n\nAs already stated, it was back then when I (f20) was 6 or 7 years old. My family and I were at a birthday party of my father\u2018s best friend. The kids usually went upstairs and spent the time together there, playing, gaming, watching tv etc.\nWe were a group of 8 kids, among them my older brother and my childhood sweetheart who was a year younger than me.\nSaid sweetheart had been my kiddy boyfriend for years prior already, we usually said we were married and occasionally smooched eachother, nothing unusual. \n\nThat evening I remember the oldest kids (my brother, my sweetheart\u2019s brother and the brother of my friend) were in a different room gaming while the rest of us killed time on the internet with silly yt videos.\nI\u2018m not entirely sure but I think one of them, not my sweetheart, put on a porn and they were laughing about it.\n\nAfter some time my sweetheart took me by the hand and led me to the bathroom, saying he wanted to show me something. When we were in the bathroom, he told me to take off my pants and that he\u2018d show what he has aswell. Nothing unusual for kids.\nBut then he told me to kiss him on his private parts, I declined and wanted to leave the bathroom, but he quickly got over to the door and locked it, taking the key and telling me I had to do it otherwise he wouldn\u2018t let me out.\n\nI clearly remember the other 3 kids spying through the keyhole and giggling, I was really embarassed and didn\u2018t want to call my brother because I had already pulled my pants down, I didn\u2018t want him laughing aswell (he probably wouldn\u2018t have and would\u2018ve smacked them without batting an eye).\n\nSo I did what he demanded and gave him a kiss down there, he did the same to me, we pulled up our pants and left the bathroom.\n\nI never told anyone about it because I didn\u2018t really think it was something notable, I also felt really ashamed of myself even years after.\n\nWriting it down like this definitely makes it sound like something wasn\u2018t right with any of this, on the other hand we were really young and exploring the own body isn\u2018t unusual in that age.\n\nNowadays I struggle with really strong relationship issues and never was able to let any potential boyfriend or girlfriend get close to me.\nLast time I got as far as to kissing someone I got disgusted and nauseous.\nUpon self reflecting what could cause this repulsion I remembered this one thing that had happened, but it\u2018s not really a big deal compared to usual sexual abuse stories.\n\nI\u2018m really unsure, I\u2018d be thankful for any input.\n\nTL;DR: When I was 6 or 7 years old we were on a birthday party; my childhood sweetheart told me to kiss his private parts and upon me declining he locked the door telling me he wouldn\u2018t let me out until I did it. \nMind he was a year younger than me.\nWas this sexual abuse or was it just some unfortunately played out childhood curiousity?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

One time we got into an argument and he started yelling at me. I said something he didn't like so he put his hand over my mouth. After that i finally decided i\u2019d show him i wont be treated like that \u2026. And i slapped him. He slapped me back 10x harder, and left welts on my face. I had to call out of work the next day because the bruises were so dark that no makeup i had would cover them up \n\n2.  He told me that he didn\u2019t want me jerking off or watching porn without him. That jerking me off was something reserved for him and he would get upset and annoyed whenever i jerked off without him, yet when we were together he never wanted to have sex. Later on i found porn on his phone all the time and he even had a folder saved on his safari of all his favorites \n\n3.  I started to not trust him so i went through his phone. I found where he had messaged PR (a guy that always wanted to hook up with him and was midly stalkerish towards him and we loved to say how annoyed we were at him). PR had requested dick pics of him, and he sent it (the same one he had sent me the day before btw) in exchange for videos of PR jerking off and having sex with his two boyfriends. When confronted he said it was just bc it was funny and so he could use the videos as blackmail. He said \u201cyou have the audacity to bring up PR? He used to send me stuff all the time.

He sent them pictures too of himself and organized meetups by time. He said he never acted on them. When explaining it he said he just felt distant from me and misunderstood and distressed bc he could never keep it up during sex. He thought talking to other guys would restore vigor and confidence into our sex life and he said it made him feel more confident. He said if i hadn\u2019t have found it he was never going to tell me.honestly i should probably get tested for STD\u2019s after that  \n\n5.  He told me that he hoped i knew no other guy would ever put up with my shit and how complicated i was. That i should be happy i have him  \n\n6.  When i would hold him accountable for things he said or did he would say i wasn\u2019t even trustworthy because i \u201cforgot stuff all the time\u201d so who\u2019s to say i didnt just forget this as well and make it up in my head  \n\n7.  One time we got into an argument and he kept telling me to eat but i didn\u2019t want to. Finally he took the food and shoved it into my mouth while i had my mouth closed. I told him that had really upset me and that \u201cno one else had ever disrespected me so much in my entire life\u201d. He mocked me about that and made fun of me saying that for months \n\n8.

She constantly holds my words against me, and tells me how much I've hurt her with what I've said. If I try to respond, she'll say something along the lines of \"I just can't do anything right\" or \"I'm a terrible mother.\" She and my stepfather blame me for being a \"black cloud over the family,\" and try to use my sister (whom I love very much) to get me to \"treat them with more respect\" by saying I'm hurting her very badly with my actions.  \n\nI feel paralyzed, which keeps me from doing both the things that I want to do and the things they want me to do, which makes them more angry.  \n\nSome of the support I thought I had has been disappearing. My dad believes that my mom can stress me out sometimes, but he always says that she only wants the best for me, and that I should do more for her and my stepfather. My aunt, whom my mother has hurt as well, knows my mother is abusive but says not to do anything until next August (when I leave for college). There's no other family I can turn to. \n\nMy best friend of 8 years (and boyfriend for 1) has kept me going. He's helped me see that I deserve better than how I'm being treated now, but I don't know how to achieve that. Going to college is so so important to me, and I got into the school of my dreams by committing to play soccer there. However, I need to continue to play in order to keep my commitment, so I don't have time to work and make money. I know going to college and getting the degree I've wanted since 6th grade will make me happy in the long term, but I don't know how to survive here until I leave. What do I do?\n\nWow.

He kept me from my family and friends, made me doubt everything about myself always, stripped me of all my confidence, and pressured me for sex. It ended after his anger got out of hand and I started to be afraid of his outbursts. He would scream and slam doors and punch steering wheels.

Just looking for support and whether or not this seems to be narc abuse .\n\nHey, so I've been best friends with this guy now for about 6 months who I ended up falling in love with. We've known each other for a few years but back in August we started to get really close. We said things to eachother that we had never told anyone else, had all the same views on life and felt like we could 100% trust eachother with everything. We would hang out for 12 hours sometimes just talking and laughing.We told eachother we loved eachother and that we felt like soulmates. At this point we were talking and seeing eachother almost every day, and even though said we were physically attracted to one another had not expressed romantic feelings. \n\nWhen we finally confessed feelings at the end of November he freaked out and told me he couldn't lose me and if we were dating that means I would eventually see the real him and leave him and he couldn't lose me like that.  So I said we could just be friends and he said no he couldn't stand to see me with someone else but I deserved better then him. He then just got up and left and we didnt talk for a week.\n\nThen when we talked he said he loves me too much to date me so we should be friends, but all of our interactions after that end up being more relationship like then before. He ends up spending the weekend and Christmas with me and my family and also comes with me to visit my sister (4 hr drive)on NYE. We stayed for a few days. Things always end up more then friends when we are drunk and he confesses how much he loves me and says no one understands him the same and he cant be without me but then the next morning he will friendzone me until I treat him like a friend then he will be coupley towards me again pulling me back and forth. I didnt mind it because I understood that hes going through alot and not in a good place so I understood why he wouldn't want to date but obviously when you have feelings and attraction it's hard to help it sometimes. \n\nFast forward we are on our way back from my sisters and he starts saying how it seems like I still like him but he wants to reminds me we are just friends and he doesnt feel the same and isnt attracted to me. I start crying because all the more then friendly interactions are ones he initiated and not even a week ago he was saying he wants to date me and is in love but I deserve better then who he is right now. He doesnt comfort me while I cry, just turns the music up and ignores me. \n\nAs the ride goes on I start to realize more and more how one sided everything has been, how much I've helped him and how he is the one who said he wanted friendship but kept crossing lines. He starts to notice the change in my energy towards him and gets increasingly mad. We arent speaking at all but when we get to the gas station says I have an attitude. After that he starts driving really fast and i start to get scared.Doesnt say a word until we park and says \" I can feel how much you hate me all the sudden.  If this is how you're going to treat me from now on we cant be friends anymore\". I say calmly that I understand because at this point I started to feel afraid and really was not attracted to him anymore. He slams the door and puts all of his stuff in his car acting as If he is going to leave. Then he runs back and says \"so what do you want to do??\" And I say I thought we are no longer friends. He says \"that's not what I said, dont twist my words I'm doing this for you since you cant stand just being friends with me so what do you want ?\" And I said calmly again I'm fine with being friends and do not feel an attraction at all anymore. He laughs and says I'm lying to myself how could I possibly be attracted to him that morning but not now.  I tell him he can believe what he wants but I'm ok with just a friendship And he says \"well that's not what I want. I dont want to be friends. Did you ever think maybe I still have feelings and need space? Not saying that's what it is. I'm not saying we wont be friends. But I need space\" and slammed my door and left.\n\nI feel so confused and lost. I feel like all of the sudden I can never see him the same.. in the 6 months we were so close we never once even argued and he never got angry with me. This is the first time hes ever yelled at me. Obviously I do not want to ever date him now. But I dont know if I could even still be his friend or not. I dont know how to feel. It's like I saw a completely different person then my best friend. Sorry if this is confusing.  I just feel like I'm probably going to be advised to cut him out and I don't know what I should do to cope with it all. Or how to deal when he does text me eventually.  Is it wrong of me not to want to be friends after this? I really care about him and love him, but I do not want to be used and that's how I feel now.\n\nTldr: in love with my bestfriend , had a realization that he has been using manipulating me in alot of ways, dont know how to cope", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Totally out of the blue, thought we were great and she has spent 10 years telling me I\u2019m the bees knees. I had a long period of depression recently, 1.5 years and when I revealed what was wrong with me, she totally backed off and threw herself into the kids ( we have 2, 4&amp;2) and looking after things. Her justification for leaving me was I didn\u2019t do enough, despite me making it clear some days I can\u2019t do more the haze into space. I had expected her to be there for me, but put it down to her not being very empathic and unsure how to approach a depressed person.\n\nI let her know that I was sorry for neglecting her and the house and worked to be the person I was when we met. I gave her every moment of my time, redoubled my efforts and she seemed to return to her love for me. Everything seemed turned around, I felt I had an last minute reprieve. During the initial\u201cI don\u2019t love you any more talk\u201d she had revealed some threads that I decided to pull on after I thought we had resolved our issues. Turns out for our entire relationship she has been cheating emotionally, and often trying to hook up with old crushes from the past that rejected her in her youth. Pathologically. Multiple times, multiple men. None of them I think took her up on her offer and I had no idea this was going on for ten years! Some of them she even had me go to trips with and spent time while I was around trying to connect with them in the moments I was out of sight.\n\nOver the course of the last month she revealed more and more relationships of different levels with men. I could see she was trying to get validation from these men that rejected her. She told me variously, some she thought better looking then me, some better at providing, some more intelligent. Harsh things to hear and so cruel, given to me under the defence \u201cwell you did ask me to be honest\u201d. Finally she told me she always though she was better than me, and once she felt more confident due to my attraction and validation of her, she could \u201cupgrade\u201d to someone better. Try to test if her \u2018new\u2019 self could turn the heads of all those guys that rejected her. She claims it was only to get them to notice her, but on occasion she admits it could have gone further if the feelings had been reciprocated. She was doing this even when pregnant with our first child, where I would expect her to be happiest in our relationship.\n\nThe other day I was upset at being told I was inferior and I could see that her usual look of kindness and compassion was gone. Her face was empty, almost impatient so I asked her then a question I worried about asking before. \u201cDo you feel any guilt?\u201d Her answer was \u201cno. I just feel numb\u201d I told her to pack her bags and leave. She told our eldest daddy was throwing mummy out because she said bad things. The child is only 4 and very sensitive. \n\nShe admitted to me while she was out of the house she came to understand why I was upset she was going to leave me and disrupt my relationship with the kids. She had not even considered how upset I might be to be kicked out of my family out of the blue! I let her back as I\u2019m weak, but I found out while she was away she was talking to friends and family and feeding them a very sanitised version of what happened, and that they felt she was being wronged by me. She says even her councillor is telling her that I am exaggerating how bad things are, she didn\u2019t do anything that bad and is a good person. \n\nI can now see she is hiding some of the worst of what she does as she is so desperate for others to believe she is very kind and will do anything for anyone. In person she is rather distant, doesn\u2019t seem to have emotion except when it intersects with her, and is quite lazy - though I am too and that\u2019s why I assumed it was me fucking up the relationship. She admitted that she cannot give up this caring image people have of her and so isn\u2019t comfortable admitting she cheated on me for 10 years and hid it from everyone when all I did was tell her I loved her each day, up until I backed off due to depression.\n\nHer mother was distant with her as a child, sometimes treating her more as a confidant about things you should not discuss with kids. Her mother married her father to get out of a traditional family situation where she was expected to do everything. She picked him for what he could provide, but didn\u2019t love him and led a separate life pretty much from when my partner was young up until she knew he had nothing left to offer. I am coming to feel that I am the same in my relationship with her daughter. A window to something better until something even better still can be found.\n\nI try to give her hints on how we can work through it but she tries for a day or so then seems to forget we are even having this problem and reverts to previous behaviours. I always knew I wasn\u2019t her priority, but I believed her when she told me she loved me so often and trusted her never the less. She leaves me in corners at family functions where I still don\u2019t know some of them after 10 years, and then berates me for not wowing them with small talk and such. She does the same for her friends. I\u2019m introverted but over the years really tried to make her proud. But I sometimes feel she wants me to look like a fool so people can feel she is put upon having to be laboured with me. when I am sick and too feverish to get up for a glass of water, she can take 3 hours to bring one when asked, despite having her phone nearby all the time and so will have seen my text.\n\nWe still are intimate which is great and even more often now, she apologised often (though I feel she isn\u2019t taking responsibility for what she has done despite the words) but when I catch her in this emotionless state, she says such cruel things that can\u2019t possibly show love. I recently caught a video on YouTube (as I\u2019m researching emotional cheats) about covert narcissists and although there isn\u2019t a complete match, there is a lot there now so I wondered if based on what you can see, which is only a small amount of it, do you think I may be dealing with one?\n\nIf you made it this far, you have my thanks and appreciation.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He said himself he doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with the fact that he gives me love and affection when he sees fit or that he only gives me love and affection when I ask him to. When I pointed this out last night his response was \u201cwe can\u2019t spend 24 hours of the day together\u201d I never asked him to do that, all I said was it\u2019s a red flag that he only acknowledges me and gives me affection when he wants to or when I ASK him to. He looked confused and then changed the subject \n4. Today on MONDAY the 7th of JANUARY 2019, he told me that he was staring college soon and I said that was great and he would have fun doing it, he expressed how happy he was and excited to learn and get his life on the road, ( he finally re applied for fafsa and it was great and he was excited. \n5. Just now he told me that AFHS wants him to \u201cgraduate\u201d the program and that they were \u201cboth in agreement\u201d even though the last fight we had he was complaining about how he thinks program is helping him and he doesn\u2019t feel ready to go. Before he went to work today he said the therapists at the program told him to take until the 14th to reconsider LEAVING the program. The LAST time we talked, he was still wanting to go to group and was more than happy going out of spite. When I asked him why he changed his story he told me, it\u2019s what I WANTED because I have a bias of how the program treated me (they slut shamed me when someone sexually harassed me and spread false stories about me and then kicked me out when I called the police on the person who was stalking me) I reminded luis that the last time we talked I changed my stance on him attending the program because, with him starting school and having less hours at work it would make perfect sense for him to go back to attending the program. HIS RESPONSE was \u201cI always flip flop\u201d I responded by saying this time is different because he will be dividing his time with school work and his job, ONCE AGAIN he cut me off mid sentence and kept saying how indecisive I am, I asked him why he thinks I\u2019m being indecisive if I have literal evidence to back up why and how I won\u2019t change my mind about this. He said I could talk to the therapist on the phone tomorrow so I could hear from them that they \u201call think he\u2019s made progress and doesn\u2019t need to attend anymore\u201d \n6.

Luis hasn\u2019t respected my wishes to not hug and hold me.

ANYWAY) When he got home he roughly slapped a sticker on my shoulder and then just stood by me in the dark, he then proceeded to turn the light on and forcefully hug me and I had to push him back and tell him not to and to stop. ( he didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t) I asked him why he wouldn\u2019t listen and he went on about how he \u201cNEEDS\u201d to hug and hold me. I told him I hd nothing to say to him, he closed my laptop as I was JUST about to start Bandersnatch. He unplugged my laptop charger and when I tried to plug it back in he undid the ENTIRE outlet thingy (Ac, Phone Charger, Laptop, he then proceeded to take a apart my charger(apple chargers slide off) I asked him why he wouldn\u2019t plug it in then he calmly stated that it was in fact plugged in when it was NOT!!!!!

I chuckled out of disbelief because first of all, how the fuck is he going to say It\u2019s my BPD doing all this shit but he gets SO ANGRY at me when I use it as an excuse (which I rarely do, I use it only when I feel it\u2019s my only option) \n9. He got in bed and he kept saying I couldn\u2019t leave him yet because he has \u201csomething planned\u201d He kept putting emphasis on the word \u201cPROPOSAL\u201d which I\u2019ve had a terrible experience in my first relationship ( I was forced in to an arranged marriage with my rapist when I was 17, I stabbed him and we went to court and he got off and I had to leave school because he turned everyone against me and I was getting death threats then I tried to kill myself and ended up inpatient for a few months then I left town) \n10.

And my other sister who is in scotland writing plays. I have been isolated from my former life, I have NO support system, I am not currently in therapy as It has been hard to find someone who will take my file (BPD, Bipolar type 2 mixed features, Ptsd and depression) all the people I have talked to have told me they don\u2019t want to risk me ruining their practice and others have just said they KNOW they won\u2019t be able to handle me. So I am HELPLESS. I have the financial means to leave but don\u2019t have anywhere I can go to. I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m fed up I\u2019m sad and scared that I will truly kill this man. I know I would go away to a hospital for a long time but maybe that wouldn\u2019t be so bad?

I know I have a shite track record but, this can\u2019t be how the rest of my life will turn out, can it???\n\nOK TLDR - being gaslighted and manipulated and emotionally broken and will snap eventually ( not going to type what I want because I don\u2019t need police showing up here. I\u2019m not doing ok and just need advice I guess, SORRY THIS WAS SO CONVOLUTED AND LONG AND JUMBLED MY BRAIN IS FUCKED AND I WROTE THIS ALL IN ONE GO ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I'm pissed that it took me this long to actually acknowledge that this was abuse. I'm pissed that my default is to still make excuses.  I thought that because I fight back against his \"rules\" that it wasn't that bad. It's a HUGE argument if I go out by myself. If I'm 5 minutes late getting home from work, he wants to know where I've been. We used to talk and have conversations, he says. Now, are conversations are arguments, because nothing I ever say is right in his mind. I've been told flat out that my opinions were wrong. The way I clean is wrong. The way I dress is wrong. My friends are not people I should associate with. My parenting is wrong. It's at the point where I just let him yell at me, because anything I say is going to just make it worse, and that's when things get broken. Phones, iPads, tables, etc. But of course it's my fault. If everyone would just LISTEN to him and do what he said, everything would be fine. It's be great. He's too preoccupied with people seeing him as a \"good guy,\" when in reality, he's an asshole. It's going to be hard, because I'm only working part time, and my girls are not staying here. He loves them, and they him, but I'm not leaving without them.

I have been reading a lot about narcissism yet I can't be sure said person has NPD but I'm sure he is severely depressed and Suicidal. \n\nTL;DR at the bottom \n\nI have been on and off with my ex for the past 5 years, being on and off started after the first year of the relationship. Through which I would say he does possess many of the talked about narcissistic traits. \n\nMy first trigger was when I found a dating app in his search history, for him to deny it then I actually prove it after invading his Google search (not healthy I know, but I was obsessed with uncovering the truth) that opened the door for me to stay alert and discovering endless lies. That was 3 years back.\n\nIt only seems that he wants me when I no longer want him, the more I show kindness the more he is Vicious, he's never satisfied with what I offered him. Main reason he states is that I left him to study abroad, forcing us in a long distance relationship. And I have to make up for that.\n\nOur first major break up, happened after I left the country, he jumped into another relationship, being so public about it on social media, became extremely social making friends, portraying himself as the social butterfly, causing me extreme pain, yet when I was back in town he at first told me how glad he is with his bf, so I left him alone, then soon after he broke up with his bf to get back to me,which I refused so that escalated to him breaking my phone, forcing me into his car and driving to a cabin by the sea. And then I called his friends to hold him down as I ran, he gave me a black eye before I run to catch a flight out of the country.\n\nSoon after he faked suicide, to force me on a flight back to take him back, which after he switched  to being extremely depressed, talking to almost no one but myself, slowly he started being intermittently supportive yet expected loads of care and support, always saying me leaving him will have to be made up for.\n\nSecond break up, again him jumping into another relationship, him the social being, me in excessive pain, through  our minor communication I can see him mirroring new interests and I then know  it's of his new guy, we block each other, then I unblock him to get  in touch when he doesn't  even reply. 7 months forward  of no contact, and he moved to my country, while in a long distance relationship with another person in our country of origin. I actually light up at first as I didn't know he's in a long distance relationship, I meet him, he is a total bitch to me, so I stop trying to talk to him.\n\nAnother 2 months and he tells me he wants to see me, we meet I fall for it again, yet everytime it is obvious that I am infatuated by him, he just turns Vicious I fall into my depression as he's just abusing me, one situation stands out is we were having sex, he finishes and has this disgusted look on his face, so I say it's ok and finish myself in the bathroom. He's falls again into this Zero friends, self hating phase and I have had enough, and that's when I discovered  he was in a long distance relationship with someone  back home, and he ended  it just before getting agin in touch with me, whenever he ignored me I kept going out with other guys, slowly building boundaries, till he discovered he is HIV+, expects me to move in as I'm his only close relationship in this country, I say I'm sorry to hear this, and we need to take our time. He attempts suicide and has to be locked up in the hospital for 4 days, He begs for another chance and I say fine, let's give it a chance, yet his attitude is the worst, he wants to isolate me from all my friends, once he finds any sort of emotional support he totally ignores me,  justifies it later that he did it because of something I did months back that made him mad. I have enough and just put even higher boundaries, he shows up at my work, which forces me to leave the office as co-workers wonder what is he doing here? I tell him he needs psychological help, he starts antidepressants and Xanax, yet his psychiatrist says he needs to be monitored when he starts it as it might increase his Suicidal thoughts, I tell him he can stay over the weekend, he ends up shouting, and crying for the whole weekend, at a certain moment I am triggered since I need to write a paper for school, so I take my things and say I'll leave, that's when he gets physical and stops me from leaving my apartment, I pull him over the door resulting in tearing his pants and shirt. He still holds on to me crying and screaming starts breaking stuff in my apartment. so I call 911 in which he starts begging me not to leave him, and threaten to swallow all his antidepressants, at this stage I hang up, asking him to not do that.\n\n\nThe next day, I take him out for breakfast, cook for him and give him a bath, buy him clothes instead of the ones I teared, he tries to clean around my apartment yet shortly he loses it again, only talking about what if I didn't leave him 3 years ago, over and over, blaming me and just wallowing. And that I am the reason he got HIV. \n\nCurrent situation, he's Suicidal, he is about to lose his job for the 4th time and if he loses his job, he loses his insurance, means he can't get his HIV meds unless he pays for it. He knows no one in this country, his family stopped calling him. And I blocked him on social media yet he can text. And it's all the same, about suicide. I'm anxious and depressed myself. Sorry about the long post but I am so helpless now, could my empathy be due to codependencey, not a single argument or discussion of us ends with us agreeing, it always ends with huge conflict while he's shouting too loud while I use my very cold low voice tone as a defence mechanism which only makes him raise his voice or break the first thing he sees.\n\nTL;DR: been on and off with a narcissist, now after moving to country where I'm based, he is extremely suicidal, has no one, about to lose his job that gives him health insurance that pays for his HIV meds, I would go no contact, yet I can't deal with the idea of him killing himself or not get his HIV meds.\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Fights have stopped and we do text every couple of days now but it's very minimal contact beyond \"I'm good, how are you?\".

One of them said \"what a fucking narcissist!\" My narc friend noticed and looked up at them for a while, trying to hear what they were saying, but she couldn't make it out, so she kept working.\n\nIt got me thinking: I wonder what would happen if I struck up a conversation with her about narcissistic people. You know, talking about them as if she weren't one of them.

We had just been on holiday together for 2 weeks. It was pretty awful at times as I said something he thought was offensive (i can totally see how it was but it wasn't anything personal and i wasnt trying to be offensive) and he got very angry and wouldn't speak to me for a whole night and day. I was apologising profusely and crying and I am ashamed to say begging for his forgiveness but to no avail. I managed to hug him by getting into his bed while he was asleep and we ended up having sex. I said again after I was so sorry but he said I haven't forgiven you! Then he was hot and cold to me for the next few days and when I said it doesn't seem like you want to be with me he said 'I already told you I didn't!'. This was after having some really good times and affectionate times so it confused me.\nWhen we got home, he didn't call me once in 4 days just quite impersonal texts (nothing like how are you?). I eventually called him on Xmas eve to see when we would meet to exchange presents and he told me he hadn't got me one. He said he had dropped hints that he couldn't afford one (but he bought gifts on the holiday for people and himself). Then he said he had been meaning to get me one but it didn't work out due to money and time. I cried because I felt so rejected after everything that had gone on on the holiday and I felt he really didn't care for me any longer. He said he needed to go and hung up. Then on Christmas day he texts me like nothing happened, I wished him a Merry Christmas. Then Christmas night he texts 'So am I going to get to see you today' I replied that I had tried to arrange this yesterday and now it was too late. To tell the truth I didnt want to see him but I didn't say this. After a bit I ask 'are you free boxing day?' and he says no. Not anymore. And that was the last I heard from him. I called him and text him once each after that but he didn't respond. I wasn't surprised as he has given me the silent treatment so many times in the 7 years I have known him.\nEvery time it has been because he has found something I have said mortally offensive (which I hadn't meant to be offensive at the time). I felt like I was treading on eggshells all the time. Also he has no problem telling white lies if it helps him, and he likes to maintain relationships with aquantancies for what they can give him (this is what he has told me). He has also told me he has no issue cutting people out of his life (should have listened to the red flag!). He likes to be in control and had told me he does not trust anyone. It usually felt like we were vying for the upper hand (even though I wouldnt say I am naturally like this) and I felt like I was always having to defend my point of view. \nHe has never hit me and at times he seemed really engaged and like he did care about me. I believe still he is a good person trying to do his best the only way he know how. I don't know what to think about narcissism. I realise he might just not like me enough. I always suspected he might not treat a different girl like this. When i asked him if he cared about me his response was that he cared to much.

My parents kept threatening and seriously were going to call police after me and convinced that they would've taken me away, because I had harmed myself earlier the same year. \n\nMy father banged the door violently and demanded me to open it. Because i felt that I had no other options, I decided to open it. He came aggresively towards me hand in the air. I instinctively charged towards him because I was cornered, but tried to slow my punch down to a push. Then he jumped on me and started to choke me. It wasn't my first time, that he'd attack me. \n\nAfter I got away, I ran outside and called every childprotection number i knew, but because it was sunday, the lines  didn't work or were full.

I'm going to tell this story in chronological order, with everything coming together at the end because that's the only way I understand it.\n\nIt begins when I was was three, I know, way too young to solidly remember. I was living in Virginia at the time, my father wasn't around and my mother worked all day so she dropped my twin sister and I off at a babysitter. I know it was a married couple who had a few kids around my age, as well as a few dogs. What I remember about this place is always being locked into a living room via baby gate with my sister, the couple's children, and their dogs. I remember ALWAYS being terrified in that house. The dogs were terrifying, the kids were terrifying, but most of all the babysitting couple were terrifying. I remember that everytime my mother came to pick us up we would run over and embrace her, crying our eyes out. Maybe this didn't happen everytime, because my mother is a very good woman and it's hard for me to imagine her continuing to bring us their if she didn't think we were safe. Maybe she thought it was us being three? I don't know. Like I said it's what I remember. \n\nFast forward to the years when my memory is much sharper, from about kindergarten until I was around ten, I had horrible paranoia. It was like a phobia attached to life itself. I was never unafraid. It kept me up at night. It kept me from enjoying anything outside of everyday activities. My poor mother and stepfather couldn't sleep either because everytime I \"heard a noise\" after lights out I had to go wake them up to search the house for me. My own baby brother who I shared a room with learned to comfort me, saying it was him bumping the wall anytime I claimed to hear something. Eventually I grew out of this, and now I fear next to nothing.  Quite the contrast I know. Used it all up I guess lol. \n\nThings very recently, however, took an interesting turn. Many times throughout my life I have brought up to my mom, \"Didn't Lisa and I have some bad babysitters when we were younger? Didn't they go to prison?\". And every time I brought it up to her over the years, she simply delfected it. I thought I was crazy for being so sure. Oh well. A few weeks ago i was having a conversation with my brother. It started out pretty normal until my brother absent mindedly said that my mom accidentally told my twin sister something we were never supposed to know. That's all he said. We werent supposed to know. It took me all of five seconds to look him dead in the eyes and ask,\"Does it have to do with a babysitter when Lisa and I were younger possibly molesting us?\". He was dumbfounded. \"How did you know?\" He said my twin sister had a secondary check up with the gyno because apparently he found something odd that could be a pretty big deal (turned out to be nothing) so he asked her to come back. My younger brother over heard a phone call between my sister and my mom just prior to the appointment. My mom told her story to my sister because she wanted her to hear it from her rather than the doc. She said my sister and I, back when were three, simultaneously walked up to her and proclaimed that the man \"Put his dick in our mouths\". We said dick. A pair of three year olds said dick. Obviously my mom took these guys to court, but couldnt put them away due to lack of evidence. You know, the physical kind. She never told us, but has always feared it affected us throughout childhood.  Back to me. The truth is I've always known. I don't remember any act, but aside from my fear I always asociated that house with a sexual tone. I think it's because I remember being called down the hallway by the man to the bathroom, with the sound of a shower running in the background. It's my most vivid memory of the house in fact. I can see it as if it happened yesterday. Personally, upon hearing this from my brother, I didn't cry. Didn't even get upset actually. If anything I felt good about not being capable of fooling myself into believing something along those lines occured. Over the next few days, however, questions began forming in my mind. The constant childhood fear? My inability to initiate physical intimacy ( I'm capable, I just never feel others will want it until the put their tounge in my mouth lol). And TO THIS DAY I'm very uneasy around large dogs, even if I know them. What do you guys think? Is there anyway I could know? I mean this happened so long ago I essentially lived my life after it. Any thoughts are welcome. I haven't confronted my mother, I figured if she so chose she could feel that she took it to the grave to protect me. I have a feeling with me it would be especially hard considering my bringing it up throughout life as if I remembered. \n\nTL;DR  A recent conversation somewhat confirms my beliefs that I was molested as I child.

I initially responded \"You've already apologized, there's no need for any further contact\" and of course he replied \"okay I was just trying to say sorry in hopes that you'd forgive me and we could talk.\"\n\nI then drafted the letter below, which I am unlikely to actually send because I know it will just fall on deaf ears and I will either receive no response or he'll try to manipulate me into feeling bad for him, but I feel the need to get all these things off my chest.\n\nXXXXXX,\n\nI struggled with whether to even send you this letter, but I ultimately decided to send it in hopes that it will give you some insight that will be beneficial in helping you understand why I am so hesitant to have any sort of communication with you.\n\nThe intent of this letter isn\u2019t to make you feel bad, but with time comes clarity and I've been able to look back on things with a more rational perspective, and in doing so I've been able to see certain situations in a better light.\n\nIf you choose to reply, all I ask is that the conversation remains productive and respectful. I'm obviously open to hearing what you have to say but if you're going to be dismissive, try to invalidate any of my feelings, or resort to name-calling I would prefer if you just don't respond.\n\nThe whole situation has caused me to go through such a range of emotions - from anger and sadness, to regret and sympathy.\n\nI poured so much into our relationship emotionally, only to be completely discarded and left to deal not only with the pain of a breakup, but the fact that you started seeing someone within one day. I was left questioning everything. After seeing those posts and finding out about the times you lied, I couldn't help but wonder what other times you were lying, whether or not you were faithful, and if you ever truly cared about me at all or if it was all just a game to prove to yourself that you could win me over and then discard me and move on to the next challenge. I also found it ironic that you felt the need to say something to me about your friend \"moving in quick\" \u00a0because he shared a political meme from my instastory a few days after we broke up, yet you were actually the one doing the quick moving. It's situations like that that made me wonder just how detached from your own actions you are, and how many other times you had accused me or someone else of something that you were actually doing.\n\nI ended up seeing a side of you that was completely unrecognizable from the sweet, kind guy I met and fell in love with, and it made me feel like you were just putting on an act in the beginning to draw me in. The last couple weeks of dating you I was made to feel like disposable; it was like a light switch was flipped and I didn\u2019t matter to you anymore. Now I realize that I didn\u2019t - because you had already lined up the next guy.\n\nWhile we were dating I had loved you so much and just wanted to do all that I could to make you happy and take your pain away, and in return I was made to feel bad for any feelings I had that you deemed unwarranted or invalid. I was made to question my own sanity for calling attention to things that were right in front of my face, only to be told that I\u2019m crazy, dramatic, or too sensitive. Our problems weren't approached with an \"us vs the problem\" mentality, but rather \"me vs you,\" which was an incredibly unhealthy way of dealing with them.\n\nWhen something I did upset you or made you uncomfortable, I did all I could to take responsibility for my portion of the blame, comfort you, and reassure you of my love for you. Yet I was told to \"just get over it\" when you were having a guy coming over at 3am to \"drink and do bumps\" and also having him stay the night in your studio apartment multiple days a week despite him living right down the street from you. If the situation was reversed, you absolutely would not have been okay with it, regardless if they were \"just a friend\" or not.\n\nMany of the times when I brought up something that upset me or made me uncomfortable, it somehow would get turned around and I was the one who ended up apologizing for making you feel bad because I even brought it up. I was left to deal with a lot of feelings on my own because I was told they were wrong. The truth was, me bringing up how certain actions of yours made me feel forced you to take a look at your own flaws and that wasn't something you were ready to do. Close relationships tend to hold a mirror up to you and make you face some personal issues that are easier to keep hidden from your more casual acquaintances - getting angry and dismissing/ignoring them is a lost opportunity for growth and change. It felt as if you despised me towards the end because that mirror was just a little too real for you to deal with, and it was easier to just move on to the next person who hadn't yet seen what I saw.\n\nI know I\u2019m not perfect and I definitely made mistakes in our relationship, however I can say that I was completely honest and faithful the entire time, that I did my absolute best at trying to be a good person to you, and that I was compassionate towards all of your thoughts, feelings, and insecurities.\n\nI have forgiven myself for letting the emotional abuse go on for as long as it did; for apologizing for having normal reactions to abnormal behavior; for not trusting my gut despite it screaming at me so many times; for believing the \u201clove\u201d I was getting was normal and was what I deserved.\n\nI was fortunate to be surrounded by so many phenomenal people who were there for me through it all - who unselfishly cared about me and my happiness. I am fortunate to have come out of this with a better understanding of myself, who I am, and what I deserve. Unfortunately that all had to come at a price that I shouldn\u2019t have had to pay.\n\nI need you to understand that although you are apologizing, the way you treated me was so hurtful and created so much mistrust that I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready to accept your apology for it, or if I even need to. I think forgiving myself may be good enough for me at this point.\n\nI hope you're able to read this letter and take it to heart instead of just dismissing it as me being \"over emotional.\" It's never easy hearing about things you've done wrong but I do think it is important that you hear these things, because a lot of the situations weren't one-off problems, but recurring issues throughout our relationship and I can only hope that the next person you date doesn't have to deal with the same treatment because it was very damaging emotionally and took awhile to heal from.\n\n[This article](https://pairedlife.com/problems/why-a-narcissist-inevitably-devalues-and-discards-you)\u00a0on Narcissistic Abuse might provide a little more insight and help you understand some of the reasons behind your behavior.\n\n\\-XXXXXXXX", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I couldn't fathom how he could believe I possibly deserved to be shoved around by my bigger brother. It was terrifying, I always stayed in my room bawling while texting my mom about how horrifying it was to be in the same house as someone who could hurt me. He always acted like he did nothing at put the blame on me. My brother also lies ALL the time, about EVERYTHING. he makes an excuse for everything and if it doesn't work he will bring someone else into it just to justify his awful actions.\n\n I don't know if this would be considered emotional abuse but I am quite sure he has messed up my mental state.

The two of the them hung out a LOT when we were dating, more than he let on, and she definitely arranges the majority of that circle's social events. I tried to imagine how things would be if I ended up going - since we had broken up before the event, I never attended.\n\nBut if I did go, I would have been uncomfortable. I already had suspicions that their friendship was questionable. At the end of everything, he admitted that she wouldn't have liked meeting me.

As the new person, I would have been the odd one out, trying to fit in with people that I don't know. I'm a pretty friendly person so it's easy for me to like someone initially, but I'm also very sensitive, so I can tell when someone doesn't like me and it affects me a lot.

He came back the next day and said I was emotionally abusive the night before and planted ideas in his head, told me that there was nothing happening between them and they were just friends.

I am having a really hard time right now. My N was my best friend or so I thought. Last March she did another month long silent treatment. We have been friends at this point for the last 8 years. I worked for her as an assistant as well. I had called her after 7 months of no contact initiated by me.  I told her that I felt that she controlled me, manipulated and lied to me. She comments: \"Why would you want to be friends with someone who does that to you?\" I said, good question. I told her I felt like she was my soulmate (she agreed) and I told her I was in love with her. After her reaction (saying she had to think about what I was saying, thanks for sharing etc), I left a message and told her that it wouldn't have worked out between us and I am moving on. I haven't heard from her since.\n\nSo now its 9 months of no contact. Unrequited love is a bitch. I did expect her to contact me to discuss it, because she did say she needed to think about it. It infuriates me that we are not going to discuss this further and now she is in control again, deciding that we are not going to talk. I should be happy, but I am not. And it's due to this trauma bonding and psychological abuse.\n\nI have been through the emotional wringer the last couple of months. I have tried cutting the emotional ties with mediation and using subliminal videos to help me heal from narcissistic abuse.  I think I need therapy but the last time I went, because of this Narc, the therapist wasn't effective and hence went back to the Narc.\n\nBut now after looking back at 8 years of friendship, working with her and spending 8 hours a day on the phone with her, fixing her life, I feel like a fool because I was used as a tool and nothing more. What a waste of time and effort. I know my worth now because of this relationship, so I guess the relationship had value. But I can't help but think what an idiot I am. I thought she liked me as a person at the very least.\n\nIn my search for help, certain meme's have come across my computer. One that comes to mind is:\n\nNarcs do not love they use. Love is their word for use. Just replace the word love with use. For example I use you, I use you so much, I will always use you, I will never use someone as much as I use you, you are the use of my life, I will use you forever etc.\n\nOthers that are helpful are \"When you know you go\" or \"Sometimes giving a second chance is like giving them an extra bullet for their gun because they missed you the first time.\" or \"hurt people hurt people\".  On my pinterest board, I have 738 pins about narcissism that I read to help me remember what an asshole she is. On my healing board, over 200 pins.\n\nNarcs don't change. Death is the only release from their grip. Sometimes I think I can forgive her for being self centered, egotistical, rude, immature, emotionally unavailable, manipulative, secretive, controlling, but in the end, how do I forgive myself for allowing a person with those characteristics into my life again?. Her false self keeps cropping up in my mind and it confuses me. After not talking with her for 9 months, how could I still be so affected by this slime ball? I have had numerous relationships in my life that have ended, and barely thought of the person 9 months later.  I find this very difficult to move on from. I want too, so I can meet new folks that are worth my effort.\n\nOne day at a time. It's like recovery from drugs or alcohol. Only, with drugs and alcohol, the withdrawals don't last 9 months.  I sure hope things start looking up. I have blocked her again, but she isn't calling or texting anyway. But blocking helps because it clears my energy a little, knowing I won't be seeing her name come up on my phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading and letting me vent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm fairly certain they're a sociopath (and not the Shane Dawson documentary kind of sociopath haha) and they would often talk about how they can change their entire personality in order to get people to think they're great. And it worked, because when I eventually escaped the relationship everyone stopped associating with me, because of how my abuser would cry, making sure it was in front of everyone, and tell them I ruined their life by breaking up with them. I still don't think anyone from my hometown believes that I was abused - after leaving home and feeling safe enough to talk about my experiences online, someone sent the posts I was writing to them and my abuser then tracked down my social media and contacted me to tell me to stop talking about it.

I just want to speak out and tell these psychiatrists that they're letting someone into their field who is abusive and dangerous, but I don't want to deal with the inevitable backlash that would cause. Plus, since the abuse happened years ago, I don't have any evidence because I (stupidly) deleted all the messages that would incriminate them. \n\nSorry for the rambling, I just really needed to get off my chest how horrible I feel at the prospect of my abuser becoming a respected, trusted member of the community as a doctor and worse, psychiatrist.

My first memory was my dad yelling at my mom. Around the time I was 6 I only knew about the N word and Cunt because that's what my dad used to call my mom when they fought. Not to long after that leaving the house for a night or two was a regular thing. This only created more problems. My dad would be mad at my mom because he used to think that she \"was using the kids as pawns for her game\".  I still remember all the times my mom would be up crying because of him. Time and time again it was hard to sleep because of all the fighting. I would say around 8 years old my dad started to verbally abuse me. He would think I was lazy or wasn't trying in school. Turns out I had ADHD, Dysgraphia and Dyslexia. He also would fly off the handle whenever I would mess up like a normal kid would. My mom would always try to step in to take some of the tension off but it always became a bigger fight. I always thought it was my fault to. Then at 10 years old my dad hit me for the first time. It was bad. He punched me straight in the chest so hard the I went back a few feet. Instantly there was a bruise. My mom got my brother sister and I in the car and she didn't know what to do. When she started to go to the police I tried so hard to stop her. I thought my dad was going to be arrested but she said she had to do it. When we went to the police they came back to our house and made my dad wait outside while we got our stuff. right before I left i saw my dad out side by the policeman and I felt so bad. I felt like it was all my fault. My mom took my siblings  and I to her friends house for a few nights. This would continue where he would get upset and lash out and us having to leave for 3 or 4 days. I used to consider it a good week if there was only 2 fights that week. Things stayed fairly the same for a while but then I got into jr high. This is where my dad used to abuse me weekly.

The glass didn't crack or anything but i still remember the  noise of the glass like it was going to break. While this was all going on I was struggling in school. I was being bullied beaten up on the bus then beaten up at home. My mom also had 2 very rare tumors at the time. she had to go in for surgery for the first one and get radiation for the second. All while this was going on my dad was still verbally abusive to her and even more physically abusive to me. I never agreed on why my mom stayed but I could understand. She had no where else to go my dad was the main provider of the house and she was going back to school. looking back now I didn't think much of it at the time I always thought this was all normal.

I wouldn't want to tell my mom any of this because she was undergoing radiation and I didn't want to upset her. The strangest part about all this looking back at it is that everything would back to normal the next day. Everyone acted like nothing happened.

I don't even know what to feel and I'm really sorry in advance. \n\nI dated this guy for three years and things ended this week when I saw him with his another girl. \nLooking back, he was very concerned with me. I just got out of a toxic relationship and it was very sad as well. He tried to get me by saying the things I wanted to hear and surprisingly, almost all of our hobbies are the same. I thought, this was it. I was attracted by him for some reason and eventually we dated. 3 months after, he ghosted me for no good reason. I cried a lot that time and my condition (psoriasis) got worse. It spread throughout my body. He talked to me three weeks after and tried to reconcile with me. The me that was looking for the person he was on our courtship stage agreed to. I was really happy. Until signs have appeared. I was a church girl and I loved singing. You know, the church is where broken people are and are quite toxic but is still tolerable. I also had a lot of friends there wherein he was not approve of. He urged me to transfer to another church and try singing there - which I am not really fond of because that church is where I grew up. I still did. For him. One time, my friends at the church invited me for a little gathering. I told my partner that I plan on going there and was already on my way. I was already near my friend's house when he sort of got angry for no good reason. I was already there at my friend's house when I decided to go home because he got angry. He was very subtle in preventing me to join with my church friends. I thought it was for the best because I thought they did not care for me too. A year and a half in our relationship,  I was very anxious. I kept on seeing him chatting with other girls. I got angry and he also got angry. I was about to walk out when he got angry and quite scary like he could hit me anytime. He had anger issues. We still reconciled by me telling him that I was sorry. And everyday I was living in anxiety because he might throw me away anytime. \n\nHe blamed me for even small things that happened. There was a time wherein I got him to go home by 5pm. He was supposed to go home at 4:30 but I asked him to come with me and find a certain professor. He went home by 5 and I also did. While I was walking home, he suddenly called me and he was in a very bad mood. He told me that because of me, he couldn't ride home because it was already rush hour. He had to get his laptop that time and the day after was a holiday. He blamed me for using up 30 minutes of his time and that left me speechless. He again reconciled with me telling that I was far more important that his laptop but his outburst earlier says the opposite. We still managed to reconcile that time but things have gotten worse. \n\nHe was kind of shouting at me almost all the time, he blamed me for things I did not do or I did not have control on. When I needed someone to be there for me, he continuously diverts the attention to himself. If I wasn't able to fulfill what he wants, he will feign illness or he'll get angry. He also told me that I was selfish and toxic because I rant about other people. I was not allowed to get angry because he'll be angrier. Because of the constant blaming and the anger issues, I lost confidence, my self esteem suffered. My condition got worse everytime, I felt that I was being plagued. \n\nUntil one day, my classmate and I had a heart to heart talk. She told me that she and her boyfriend was very open with each other. I felt that that wasn't the case for me and him. Until I had doubts about the relationship. For 3 years, I never got to meet his parents, he also lied about being a graduate, I told him before that I was proud of him because he is able to shoulder himself but when someone asked him, he took my words as his own like he was very proud of it when in reality, that time, he was very down and I had to encourage him. All my encouragements did not do anything to help him according to him. Everytime I needed someone to listen, he slept on me or will proceed to other topics. I felt very drained because he repeatedly said that he was depressed (not to offend any depressed people but it seemed like he did not want to fix himself). I had to shower him complements before making him move. His time was also important to him but when it comes to me, he doesn't care of he spends too much time with me. \n\nThat was it, I said. I got angry at him and deactivated for an how many hours. I felt that he was self loathing and I waited for his response. Until he deactivated his account too. I had to wait for 5 days before talking to him and it seemed like he was fine. He said that he wanted to fix himself and he was in his little ball of darkness and he wanted to be alone. He never spoke to me again until I saw him with his new girl. By the way i saw him liking the girl's post while he is not talking to me. And surprise, He told me that he already liked the girl and our relationship was already finished. He was suprised to see me though. It felt like he was going to pursue the girl without even properly ending our relationship. \n\nRight now, I feel so lost. I don't know who am I. I tried loving him but he only loved himself. I frequently have crying spells and I even want to consult a psychologist already because I don't know if there is something wrong with me. I have a very low self esteem. I think I am not capable of making a decision. I think the girl is prettier and has a fair complexion in contrast to me being your small girl with a brown complexion. It just hurts. I am mourning becaude I don't even know who I really am because I almost gave my everything to him. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Not to long after that leaving the  house for a night or two was a regular thing. This only created more  problems. My dad would be mad at my mom because he used to think that  she \"was using the kids as pawns for her game\".  I still remember all  the times my mom would be up crying because of him. Time and time again  it was hard to sleep because of all the fighting. I would say around 8  years old my dad started to verbally abuse me. He would think I was lazy  or wasn't trying in school. Turns out I had ADHD, Dysgraphia and  Dyslexia. He also would fly off the handle whenever I would mess up like  a normal kid would. My mom would always try to step in to take some of  the tension off but it always became a bigger fight. I always thought it  was my fault to. Then at 10 years old my dad hit me for the first time.

Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorsofabuse/comments/acjalm/should_you_discuss_emotional_abuse_from_childhood/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\nI did confront my dad about some of these things as part of therapy, in a group with my sister, mom, and therapists. I brought up two particularly salient issues that happened and in my opinion were examples of why we had a distant/shallow relationship and why I felt I could not come to talk to them for support.\n\nFirst, I watched my dad get angry with the news of something I did when I was 16/17. I told him it was less about the choice I made and more about his reaction, and that it would have been good if I had been able to come to them for guidance but I couldn't because I'd be punished unless I obeyed what he believed was the right course of action. My dad's reaction was to say that he had tried to talk to me about said issue and I said it wasn't a problem. He then became angry at me and said I lied to him by saying it wasn't a problem. I asked him (honestly, angrily) which conversation from 10 years ago he remembers me using the specific words where I lied to him; he then told me I could never understand because I wasn't a father; I told him I was entitled to feel the way I did regardless of if I was a father because I would never be a father (being a woman among other things); then my therapist tried to get things back on track and say it was less about the issue as the feelings that I couldn't talk to them or face punishment; to which my dad retaliated and pointedly and patronizingly asked the therapist if he was a father. The therapist once again said it wasn't about him or his credentials but about me and my therapy.\n\nNext we moved to a different issue. Again, not about the issue but just an example of how I felt I was not treated well. I had been helping at an event and my dad spoke rudely to me, when I stood up for myself he made it my problem for not obeying him, and so I left and did not help with the rest of the event.\n\nI watched with a new perspective as my dad used all his old \"tricks\" of escaping any responsibility. He first said he'd apologized and why were we talking about this. He said things like, \"It was years ago!\" \"You're going to have to learn to get over things!\" And belittled my emotions. He did 'apologize' but I'm not sure that it counts because it was simply him saying \"Sorry, I'm sorry, what more can I say?\" With his hands outstretched in anger and his tone dripping with condescension. It was more of a, 'I'm sorry you're so stupid you can't move on, can we please end this conversation?' apology and I don't consider that authentic.\n\nOverall, it was shit. I didn't enjoy the conversation, I didn't enjoy dredging up the past, but I enjoyed seeing first hand the rage, the lack of empathy, the selfishness, the evasion of responsibility, the guilt trips for 'everything he had done for me' (which I did not dispute and indeed agreed with during our conversation; also saying being grateful did not remove my right to be angry about a particular issue), the patronizing treatment of the therapists, the heated reaction to something that happened 10 years ago and subsequent belittling of my attempt to bring up an issue in the distant past 2 years ago, the way my mother and sister pandered to him and made suggestions for how we could work better by me adjusting to his emotions...\n\nI enjoyed all of these things because I feel relief to see all these things with clear eyes. I now recognize how I was treated and I am prepared to move forward and heal from what was an extremely dysfunctional household (even if 'all families have struggles' as my family likes to say as a way to avoid having to endure responsibility and personal growth).\n\nI didn't know how many core beliefs I have incorrect, and I'm going to challenge them every time they echo in my head. I'll no longer seek out and stand to be psychologically abused. I'll stand firm in my convictions knowing that as an absolute minimum, I deserve to feel human and equal to others around me. I will learn from the events of the past, take the responsibility that was mine, and not let them diminish me. \n\nAnd I think I'll stick to a shallow relationship with a dad who will never understand me because he isn't truly willing to grow.\n\nI'd love to hear your stories of how your life changed for the better once you started to break out of old mental patterns. Would be nice to know there's hope. Even in writing this I feel sick to my stomach for my dad likely being at home sad and hurt, when really he's the one who should be feeling guilty. I'm trying not to carry that sense of guilt and shame that it was my fault but it's very difficult.\n\nThanks everyone for supporting me in this. \u2665\ufe0f", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I've been in a abusive relationship before him.\n\nI just need an opinion on his behaviour.\n\nWhen he's in a good mood he's amazing, he loving and attentive. He tells me how beautiful I am and after we fight he tells me he loves me more than he's ever loved anyone.\n\nBut if he's tired, bored, too hot, got no money (he doesn't have a job so this happens a lot.) or someone has pissed him off he basically has a temper tantrum.\n\nI left him 4 months ago because he kept packing his shit and leaving. Like in one month I think he did it 3 times. And I've made a conscious effort to not shout or swear at him so he knows its unacceptable to do it to me.\n\nBut its the sulking, if we have to go out with my family he'll sulk the whole way there and then tell me later he has had a good time. Or if he's round and my family turn up hell leave and come back later.\n\nWhen we argue, and he tells me to fuck off or go away or tell me to stop starting with him, I tell him that what he's saying isn't nice and he's hurting my feelings.\n\n2 days ago we had a row because he was tired, he shouted, told me I talk to him like a child, threatened to kick me out the car and then made fun of what I say to him in arguments in a mocking sort of voice (he's actually done this a time before too).\n\nSo I left, he phoned me later, asked if I was okay, I said no so he put the phone down. We argued the next day and he told me to pack up his stuff and I haven't heard from him since.\n\nAm I right in thinking the best thing to do is to walk away?\n\nUPDATE : Today I ended it. I told him to send someone to pick up his stuff and explained why I couldn't be with him anymore. He was confused, he asked why I hadn't spoke to him, told me he can't help it when he speaks to me like that and that his moods have been better lately than what they have been in the past. He had no explanation for why he mocked me when I told him how I felt about how he speaks to me. In them moments it made me feel like I was back in the abusive relationship. I felt embarrassed, belittled and down. And that is a deal breaker.\n\nA part of me feels guilt that I've walked away and a little voice in my head is constantly questioning whether I made the right choice. But no one gets to take the piss out of me just because they are in a mood. I was bullied and belittled in school and then by the man who I was with for 4 years. I won't let this one make me feel like that again. Whether he meant it or not. \n\nThank you for everyone who took the time to comment and give your advice.

I firmly believe my ex is a narcissist and, since I was minimized and gaslit for so long, I sometimes have an intense urge to share my story. I still can\u2019t believe I let this happen to me. I have regret, but not shame. This is long, but stick with me if you want to go on a ride. Maybe someone out there needs to hear about my experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not here to shame poly people by ANY means, nor to let people call me a slut, as I was so-called on another subreddit.\n\nIf all participants willingly enter a polyromantic relationship with compassion, honesty, and good intentions, I\u2019m sure it can occasionally work. But don\u2019t let your excitement over the novelty of it all cloud your judgement. I had been dating my ex for about 2 years, and at the time I felt like our bond was incredibly strong. I wanted to marry this guy. I was under his spell.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn 2016, a new friend entered our circle of friends. She was funny, intelligent, confident. We all thought she was so unique and wonderful. My boyfriend confessed to me that he had a crush on her, and basically made it clear that he would leave me if I wasn\u2019t open to letting him pursue something with her. But he was somehow able to convey this message without pissing me off. In fact he made his idea sound exciting. (He's always been incredibly persuasive with words, a trait I used to envy.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was na\u00efve, I think a bit bored in the relationship, and I\u2019ll be honest, I am bi yet at the time I hadn't ever had sex with a woman yet. Initially my crush on her was as big as his. She claimed to be equally attracted to us both, which I soon found out was a lie.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell the three of us decided to start \u201cdating\u201d. It\u2019s initially very fun until I realize, oh this woman\u2019s straight, she\u2019s only into my boyfriend\u2026OK\u2026 but I still very much enjoyed her company, and for awhile she breathed new life into our home. We had all fooled around, but hadn't had PIV sex yet. I was nervous about it. I asked my ex if this could please be something we all do together the first time. He tells me that it would be better if they were alone the first time, completely disregarding my request (huge red flag). On the night he booked the hotel room (we lived together and, like I said, he didn\u2019t want me there) I was an absolute basket case. Literally anyone could tell I was not OK with this arrangement, but he didn\u2019t care. He went and had sex with her in the hotel anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA friend came over that same night and I sobbed on his shoulder until the sun came up. This was the first time I felt cared about in months, and as time went on I started developing feelings for this friend (we had always had a lot in common prior to this, it's not like I was only drawn to him because he was there for me once, although I was admittedly vulnerable and misguided.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m still in this thrupple. She\u2019s walking around wearing my clothes and my jewelry. She\u2019s moved out of her apartment and into ours only after a couple months (which, by the way, NO ONE ASKED ME about). My boyfriend has bought a new king bed. We\u2019re up all night laughing together most nights. I\u2019m ignoring all the bright, nebula-sized red flags and just basking in all this love around me that I think I\u2019m feeling. The height of my co-dependence though, really.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI should mention here that there were substances involved. Before all this, I had been growing increasingly alarmed with my ex\u2019s substance abuse. He used to just smoke weed, which is great, but he gradually started taking almost every class of drug to cope with anything:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAmphetamines, benzodiazepines, opiates, MDMA, psychedelics, research chemicals, which can all be used responsibly by some people. But not him. If he was tired, he\u2019d pop an Adderall. If the addy made him anxious, he\u2019d take a benzo (akin to Xanax). If he was suffering from benzo withdrawals (which are HORRIBLE), he\u2019d drink alcohol. If he was hungover from the alcohol, he\u2019d pop an addy. If he started to feel bad about himself, he\u2019d drink codeine cough syrup to kill the feelings. If he was withdrawing from the syrup, he\u2019d take a benzo. His emotions became this nightmare roller coaster and I was becoming increasingly concerned for his health. We fought about it frequently. I felt responsible for his well-being which was obviously an unhealthy mindset. Well the new chick, who had gone through the 12-step program for alcohol and was just about a year sober, was joining in with his drug use. She wasn't as indulgent, but I felt like her participation only validated his drug abuse/addiction. You can see why she was much more appealing to him than me.\n\nAs far as psychedelics go: Once in awhile my ex would go on a heavy trip or roll, and afterwards he'd claim he \"did a lot of work\" on himself. He said he felt \"so much happier\" \"healthier\" and more \"empathetic\". I do believe psychs can help some people to achieve these goals. However, I very much doubt that they can fix a narcissist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDISCLAIMER: Not trying to shame drug users here or say the abuse only happened BECAUSE of drugs by any means, but they certainly played a role.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, ever-faithful, I would have never cheated on my ex with the friend I was crushing on. All this time, my ex and I both claimed to value honesty above all else. I asked my ex how he would feel about me dating on the side. Well big surprise, my ex freaked the fuck out. He told me I was doing this on purpose to get revenge. He said the three of us have a good thing going, and I was about to ruin it. He accused me of using this friend. He said I was going to break our friend\u2019s heart. He\u2019d drive me around the city while screaming at me about what a horrible person I am. I laugh now, thinking about him acting like he was righteously sticking up for a friend he that hated so much and was so jealous of. The sad thing is, I believed him. I felt so guilty that I might be \u201cusing\u201d my friend that I broke contact with him before anything ever started. (Which, for that guy\u2019s sanity and my own, was probably a good thing, although we've since settled into a relaxed platonic friendship since then.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy this time I was sobbing myself to sleep most nights. I got sick of sharing a bed with what was basically a couple that I was no longer a part of, who didn\u2019t have the courage to just leave me, and who I didn\u2019t have the courage to leave. I would sometimes sleep in our roommate\u2019s bed or a friend\u2019s house, but then think about how those assholes were back at home getting intimate in my bed.  Pathetically I even slept in our walk-in closet once or twice because I didn't want my crying to keep them awake. At work I\u2019d cry quietly at my desk for hours. It was a very dark time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy ex never got over the jealousy and anger he felt about me having a crush on our male friend and this is ultimately why we broke up. (The hypocrisy is quite dizzying.) Even though he gave me a thousand reasons to leave, I just couldn\u2019t let him go. I was trauma-bonded to this horrible man. Finally the two of them moved out in November 2016, which I didn\u2019t recognize as a good thing at the time. I was devastated. Instead of losing one person, I had lost two. I was a broken mess for the better part of 2017, but I could finally start healing and being my OWN person! Life started to get...less exhausting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\u2019s a shame it look me so long to get to therapy, because I clearly needed an outside perspective from the very start. But I had my friends, all of whom supported me because they were horrified by my ex the entire time. These days I think back on these times matter-of-factly, luckily without feeling nearly as much pain. I\u2019m far, far better-off than those two (she relapsed and lost her job pretty recently; he moved to another city, did even more drugs, and lost his job as well) not to mention I have dated some very lovely men and women since then. The parts where I'm single have been great, too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can finally say that my confidence is back and I love myself more than ever. I felt compelled to post this because sometimes I still feel haunted, and I wonder what else I might be delusional about. There is another story I won't get into right now, about my ex physically abusing the girl he left me for, and how they're still in this messed up on-again off-again cycle together...but luckily I only heard about this second-hand as I'm done with both of them. To end on a happier note, I got to keep the king-size bed. It's great.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My 2 brothers in the system were thrown around a lot so I never really got to see them until they moved into their last home where they aged out of the system.

Cps did a lot pf welefare checks and found out about the mental, physical, and sexual abuse and took me, my sister, and 2 of my brothers into forster homes. When they did take us away I had to be in the hospital for a few weeks cause if how small i was (I was 8yo and fit into toddler clothes). My older 2 brothers were old enough to go out and libe on their own. My 2 brothers in the system were thrown around a lot so I never really got to see them until they moved into their last home where they aged out of the system. Me and my sister went throught a few homes which made me feel bad cause every house said theyd only take her as she was still a baby. Me and her eventually got adopted and it was amazing.. Until the dad showed he was very emotionally and physically abusive to me and my adoptive brother (his biological kid.) He babied my sister (2 at the time of adoption) to the point where she doesnt know how to function if theres even a yelling at her and shes never done chores in her life. \n\nAll this led to me having emotionally blocked out chuncks of my memory mainly from before foster care, but also a little even after the adoption. \n\nIn the recent months, since I moved out of my parents homes I stopped going to the family counselor and doctor, I now go to a new one in my town, and ive been doing things I enjoy. I'm living with my partner so when my bad days get worse, hes there for me. \nAnd since i moved out ive been getting chunks of my memory back. Not all at once or a lot. But I'll be watching a commercial and it'll show a lake and I'll remember the time my aunt took me and my brother to a lake to feed ducks for the first time. And its made me cry a few times cause its been so hard to not know your own past. Some things are weirder and I have to ask my older brother if it really happened, and he always assures me that those things did happen and I wasnt making it up. Its strengthened the bond me and my brother have now that i remember all the stuff we went through as a family. \n\nIve started talking to my oldest brothers (who assulted me) and trying to work through what had happened and why. I think thats another thing thats been helping me. ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

And just maybe I am willing to admit there was a part of me that lacked self belief).

I met one when I first got to college at a time when I was extremely insecure, vulnerable, and above all impressionable,. When I moved to Philly to go to school I really did not know how to fit in. It seemed everyone I met was opulently wealthy, preppy, and just bizarre. This girl, let's call her Carol, was in every single one of my classes my first term of school and was the only person I was able to properly bond with at school. \n\nShe began to act a sort of mentor to me, introducing me to her friends, telling me how to dress and do my makeup, what music I should be interested in. Like I said we had every class together so naturally, we hung out every day. She had me sleep over her dorm most nights, which I was thankful for at the time because I had a horrible roommate, but now it creeps me out. When the second term rolled around she had me make my class schedule alongside her to assure that we would be in all the same classes again. \n\nShe did a lot to keep my self-esteem down, one night when we were out she turned to me and said \u201cyou know, you have really hot friends\u201d, and would prevent me from doing my school work, or feeding myself right, or going to the gym. Encouraging me to get high with her instead, or feigning a crisis so I had to drop everything to focus on her, or made sure I didn\u2019t have access to cameras and other things I needed to do my work, or just not signing me out of her dorm so I could go to the gym or do my work. She would also neglect her work, and when she did poorly in school she would tell me it was because she had just been so sick, even though I had been there and I knew it was because we had just been getting high and having fun every day. The scary thing was she herself believed these lies. Nothing was ever her fault. \n\nI remember discussing her with friends from home who immediately spotted the red flags and told me to run, but I insisted it wasn't like that, that things were just different in Philly, people were just different, it was fine, I was acclimating. Carol definitely loved my naivete, it was a playground for her, because I was so unfamiliar with how things worked in this new environment she got to be the gatekeeper of reality, she decided what was real and what wasn't, and I had no reason not to believe her because what did I know? \n\nThe closer we got the more bizarre her behavior seemed, she started lying to our friends in front of me, about things I knew to be untrue, as a way to test my loyalty. She would create a world of delusion and expect me to go along with it, when I pointed out that she was not being honest or realistic she would get extremely defensive and insist I hated her. She often would say I was mean or selfish (no one who knows me has EVER called me those things, although I definitely have become meaner as a result of knowing her lol). For a while, she was my only friend, and I realized at some point she intended to keep it that way. She introduced me to her friends but was sure to maintain a boundary,  these were HER friends, and as soon as she saw me getting close to someone she would insist I was leaving her out, and she took any new personal relationship I developed as a personal attack on her. Even said about one of our friends that she \u201cnever meant for her to become part of our group.\u201d\n\nThe pair of us began hanging out with a new group of friends. I fit in very well with them and was so relieved to have finally found my people, when I expressed this relief to her she, of course, took it as a personal insult. One night she even cried and melted down because she thought I liked my new friend better than her (I did lol). \n\nHer behavior also became increasingly sexual. It seemed innocent in the beginning, kisses in the club, holding hands from time to time, and, after all, she had a boyfriend. Then it got weirder. One day when I slept over her dorm she texted me to come into her bedroom and snuggle. When I went into her room I realized she was naked, I settled on the foot of her bed and the look of disappointment on her face clear. One night when I was really really really drunk she encouraged me to go meet up with this guy who was hitting me up and long story short I was raped by him that night. She feigned sympathy when our friend told her this had happened to me, even cried, but now I wonder if that was her intention, since I was already somewhat insecure sexually and she probably wanted to keep me this way. On my birthday she lured an extremely fucked up me back to the place of a guy she had been hooking up with that night, tried to trick me into having a threesome with them, basically tried to rape me to the point where the only way out of the situation was for me to pretend to be sleeping. After I pretended to be sleeping she fucked the guy right next to me. We parted ways for the summer and she would message me regularly asking if we could have a threesome or foursome in the new school year. \n\nShe also cheated on her boyfriend regularly that summer and called to tell me as soon as it happened, even sent me nudes that she was gonna send to this new guy for pre-approval. She would bring up the guy she was sleeping with in front of me and her bf and other friends who knew she cheated, once again testing loyalty. She lied to some of our friends about the cheating, then ran to them for sympathy when her bf accused her of doing so. \n\nAt some point, she introduced me to a friend from one of her classes, and the two of us became friends and for some reason, I felt comfortable opening up to her about Carol\u2019s weird behavior. It turned out this girl was in a relationship with a narc and we began swapping stories of their behavior\u2019s and the similarities were creepy, right down to the language they used. That\u2019s the one good thing about knowing a narc is that once you have met one you have met them all, and it becomes hard to ever be fooled again. Another one of my friends was in a close friendship with a narc and it was the same story, the similarities were creepy, to say the least, like they all studied the same text on how to manipulate. I tried to end my friendship with her a few times, but every time we would just have these talks where she would say outlandish shit that was so untrue I didn\u2019t even know how to respond, and at the end of the conversation I would feel like a crazy person and our friendship would go on. I realized the only way out was going to be for me to ghost her. Our friendship lasted a year and a half before I finally got out. Honestly, I could go on for years about her, every day I remember some new fucked up shit that happened, and grateful that she is no longer in my life. Also, side note, her bf found out he was right about the cheating and now she is dating his best friend, or I\u2019m assuming ex-best friend. Messy. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This was for a few reasons. One, because I would tell myself that I was being too harsh in judging this person who I didn't know that well. Two, because I just wanted things to be positive and harmonious, and I didn't want to have to face ugly truths. And three, because I felt obligated to maintain a connection/relationship with them, for whatever reason (to be nice, to reduce conflict at work, to make things less awkward, etc). \n\nBut every time, never fail, letting the person get close to me was a huge mistake. Because once a narcissist (or any type of user/abuser/manipulator) gets close to you, they will inevitably use, abuse, and manipulate you. It doesn't matter how nice or good you are, it doesn't matter how well you've treated them, and it doesn't matter how many positive attributes you have that you think will make you immune to someone mistreating you. When it comes to a narcissist, all bets are off. \n\nIt can be really tough to draw firm boundaries when it comes to someone who makes you feel uneasy, but it is absolutely imperative. It's especially difficult when it's a narcissist who pulls the victim card, and acts like you're \"rejecting\" them. They behave like all they want is to be \"nice\" to you, and you're being so mean to keep pushing them away or refusing to give them personal details about yourself. But you have to get over coming across as \"rude\" and defend your boundaries to the hilt. Otherwise you're pulling the door wide open and allowing poison to waltz right into your life.

It was focused on him getting ME off with his hands, something that CAN be rare for ladies. Oh, and at this he was good. Just as good as he was at lying, and tearing me down, gaslighting me, and making me feel less than human. \n\nAs good as he was at the end at hitting me, threatening me with a loaded weapon, harassing me and my loved ones, hacking my Facebook and pretending to be me, stalking me to therapy and across the Pacific Ocean, leading a vicious smear campaign against me in our mutual industry, and making me hire an expensive lawyer to finally get a civil restraining order enforced. \n\nAt first when I was still stuck in the confusion of the FOG, he had a few chances to get me where I might have caved. However, he would then follow it immediately with something very clarifying that made it oh so easy to make him a subject of RAGE and HATE. He was oh so easy to hate when he also immediately moved in with the girl I suspected him of having an affair with our entire 3 years. \n\nI was sad for the person I thought he was, but once I recognized that the individual I loved actually never existed and the monster had been there all along, I started to slowly move on through hate and anger. The monster who had gone as far as to rape me when we were still together. The dreams I previously had after our breakup were full of terror and PTSD. They were him breaking into my apartment and me trying to grab my gun but being unable to move.  However, since then I have processed much through EMDR. \n\nSo why on earth am I now having an erotic sex dream? Looking into it further I guess while it perturbed me at first dreams aren\u2019t always what they are on the surface. Perhaps this is just an indication that the fear and the hatred are dissipating and what they were helping to cover for so long (a year and a half now) was that deep sadness that he wasn\u2019t who I thought he was, and that I never got to mourn any of the positive aspects of the relationship because I was too busy running away from the tornado of after effects. Perhaps, I am longing for a deep connection again even though in my daily life I tend to run from them if they try to get deeper than just sexual. \n\nThis is what I will put it down to for now, but if y\u2019all have any other ideas of what such a dream could mean please pipe up.

My goal is to spark the community into pushing and striving for something bigger than ourselves. For now, I will start with my first entry: \n\nI wanted to break down narcissistic recovery into steps. It's important to understand the path that one must take. For now I will concentrate on Step 1. But I will break down the road to recovery into 5 steps in posts to follow: \n\n1. Why I was attracted to my ex? \n2. How can I change? \n3. Boundaries\n4. Road to recovery \n5. Paying it forward \n\nIt's important to note that each of these steps will take work; and when I say work, I mean real hard work that includes therapy, medication (in some cases) and self reflection. All change, especially mental takes time and practice. Much like going to the gym in order to become strong, you cannot rush progress without risking injury. \n\nGoing back to the original topic; Why I was attracted to my ex? Is often a notion that tends to get forgotten. People will concentrate on the pain, or the memories they have rather than to ask the deeper fundamental question ....why was I attracted to this toxic person? \n\n99% of relationships out there eventually fail. It's rare that people stay together for a lifetime, or even for an extended period of time. Relationships are a chance for us to self discover. Connecting with another human being can be rewarding. But the absence of that connection once exposed can cause a lot of pain and suffering for us. \n\nRe-aligning the original question, what do people (outside of ourselves) tend to look for in a partner? You ask a biologist and they will say, the key factors of reproduction, as a psychologist, they will say our parents (or at least a mirror of them), I tend to take this interpretation. \n\n\"We seek to connect with those that represent the trauma we have yet to resolve.\" \n\nIn the case of a sex addict, they will go for someone with exaggerated sexual characteristics, in the case of someone who grew up with domestic abuse, they will try to find someone who fits that role (or manufacture it themselves), in the case of a narcissist, we will seek out....another narcissist. But why? \n\nRoss Rosenberg often talks about the notion of lacking self love, we grew up with a figure that did not allow us to express our emotions correctly. This is often associated as walking on egg shells. Why does our mind do this to us? Do we wan't to remain in pain? The answer is no.... surprisingly in order to heal from trauma, we must first relive it. Reliving the nightmare of the narcissistic parent can be quite a traumatic event, but if you take the appropriate steps, it can be incredibly rewarding. (Crazy to hear i know!) \n\nOur subconscious mind is playing a key role here.....it's manifesting the perfect storm to allow our conscious mind the ability to realize and resolve the trauma. 'Hey brain, I am going to become attracted to this person, knowing fully well he/she will hurt you in order to address this underlying issue.\" This often comes out in the form of intuition. Ask anyone who has been through narcissistic abuse (or any abuse for that matter), we all saw and more importantly felt the warning signs early on and we chose to ignore them......we \"chose\" to ignore them. \n\nSo....recovering from a Nex....how do I prevent it from happening again? Well you can start by understanding the why. I was attracted to this person because I cannot for the life of me love myself the way I know I should, therefor I am going to be attracted to someone who can show me the love (or at least imitate it) that I know I am lacking. \n\nThe first step in recovery is always admitting there is a problem. We are all here, because there's an elephant in the room. We don't love ourselves. And until that elephant is addressed, we cannot and will not have the proper defences to protect ourselves from a narcissist. \n\nSo....how do we address this? \n\nWell, first and foremost we talk; with ourselves, with others (who have been through the situation), we help guide those that are further behind. \n\nWe are a community here, each one of us has trauma that has resulted in our being here. \n\nRemember: \n\n1. We are not alone, if you want proof look at the nearly 350,000 subscribed to r/raisedbynarcissists/\n2. Each of us is worth and deserving of love. (Especially self love) \n3. The only person that will always look out for your best interests is you. So listen to yourself. Trust your intuition. \n4. Don't be afraid to speak up and say no at the expense of others. \n5. Most importantly: Never stop learning.\n\nWe are all part of this journey now. My goal this year is to help 1000 people. I am hoping this first step helps! What's your goal? (Tell me in the comments below). \n\nEvery war is won with the accumulation of small victories. This is important when understanding the larger picture. The majority of you today are here because you want answers; the easy solution to being able to fix your trauma and forget your Nex. I am telling you right now that will not happen. But what I can tell you, is with the work you will be a much better person and more importantly you will be thankful for having the experience (crazy I know). For now....let's set one small goal for ourselves. Do one thing in the next 24 hours to make you happy; whether it be going for a run, going to see a friend, eating a special food....something, anything that makes you happy even for a second. And then......repeat it this goal again in the following 24 hours. Small steps, to our ultimate goal....of self love; then and only then, can we have the proper defences in place to prevent another Narc from entering our lives. \n\n- Mr.Bluelove \n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

How to proceed?", "author": "shiverendum", "self_text": "TL;DR: Living far away from family and friends with a narc SO, tired of the emotional abuse, need to get out ASAP for my health but don't know how to leave. Don't want to ghost him but don't want to be honest and give too much warning. Scared of leaving because he has been such a huge part of my life and I never saw myself leaving him.\n\nI want to share a little bit of my experience and ask for some advice. I am very grateful to everyone who posts on this sub \u2013 without you sharing your stories and experiences, I would never have realized that I\u2019m in an abusive relationship with a narcissist and I might have continued suffering for years or even the rest of my life.\n\nI met my narc SO 5 years ago and we have been dating for most of that time. I am 25 (F) and he is 30 (M). We live together and have done so for over 3 years. The verbal/emotional abuse has gotten worse since we moved across the country and away from my family and everyone I know. I only realized that he could be a narcissist about 6 weeks ago. I always rationalized the abuse in my head, thinking that he was just sensitive or hot-blooded or emotional. I believed him when he told me it was my fault and that I deserved it or made him treat me badly. I have spent so much time and energy trying to fix and improve myself to meet his impossible standards. The only reason I realized I was being abused was because he did or said something unpleasant to me and I searched it on Reddit \u2013 that\u2019s how I found this sub. It was like a weight was lifted off my shoulders, realizing that I wasn't the problem. On [this list]( https://medium.com/@julieann2103/how-to-tell-if-youre-in-a-relationship-with-a-narcissist-a-100-point-checklist-2c7e9afd0f97), my narc has about 75 of the traits. However, he can also be extremely kind and thoughtful when he wants to be, which keeps me confused and hopeful (intermittent reinforcement).\n\nEven though it feels like the hardest decision I have ever made, I need to leave as soon as possible. His abuse is having tangible effects on my health and well-being. I am suffering from health problems that only started after I became isolated with him, away from any other social support or buffer. I have developed skin conditions and suffer from hair loss and bruxism that is connected to the abuse. To put it simply, I feel like I\u2019m drowning and there is no relief. I have been on vacation away from him for a few weeks and have felt so much better mentally and physically. This time apart (with people who actually love and care for me) has helped me see things clearly. I finally told my family and friends what's been going on and the support has been truly incredible, and is the main reason why I feel strong enough to leave. \n\nWhat makes it even harder is that to the outside, our relationship seems normal and it seems like we have a good life. He has spent a lot of time with my family and they got along well (despite being disturbed about how he criticizes me). His family loves me and we have a lot of mutual friends. He has a lot of friends and is very well-liked - people would never believe that he could be so nasty behind closed doors. Because we live together and have a life together, leaving seems incredibly daunting. It would mean leaving our home and the city we live in, quitting my job, and moving back in with my parents. I don\u2019t know what I would tell our friends or how I would explain it to his family, but I guess my health is most important now.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to initiate the breakup? Leaving just seems so surreal and impossible, but I know that I need to leave and the longer I delay it, the worse things will get. I just don\u2019t know how to do it because he has controlled me for so long. I am not comfortable ghosting him \u2013 he doesn\u2019t expect that I would ever break up with him and even though he has caused me a lot of pain and suffering, I don\u2019t think I can do it. I am afraid if I give him too much warning he will say horrible things and make me question my decision or suck me back in. I also don't see the point in explaining to him why I want to leave - he is completely unable to accept responsibility for any of his behaviour so it will just make him angry. He has never hit me (he has pinched me and pushed me around a little) but he has admitted to hitting his ex-girlfriends when they made him angry. I really don\u2019t know how to proceed but I can\u2019t spend 2019 suffering again. I am wondering if I should stretch the truth and tell him I need to move back with my parents because I am too stressed here and can\u2019t stand being away from my family anymore. I just want to be safe and prevent him from freaking out.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. \n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He was sweet and understanding, also patient. My ex before had an anger problem(not abusive, distributive would be the best way to describe it). So he was a breath of fresh air.\n\nHe loved talking, touching me, complimenting me, he wanted all the things I wanted, real love, kids, and marriage. \nHowever, when things didn\u2019t go his way, he\u2019d break up with me. I\u2019ve never been in a relationship where almost every fight turned into, \u201cI\u2019m done, you did this and this,\u201d and I was stunned.  He did it within the first month, and I swear to god every little fight would take a turn into him throwing all of my insecurities at me, or my job, or how much money I make and making it a reason why I\u2019m not a good fit for him.\nHe would never take responsibility, it was always sorry, \u201cbut.\u201d I don\u2019t throw low blows, no matter how mad I am, because it\u2019s easy. And I have taken responsibility for arguments where I felt I was wrong, and I was. He has not done the same.\n\nI had an abortion in November, and he supported the decision and then told me he didn\u2019t and if I had the procedure he wouldn\u2019t be with me because he\u2019d resent me. I was devastated, because I want children, but by this point in our relationship we\u2019d broken up every two weeks and he had said told me if we weren\u2019t together I should get it, and I didn\u2019t want to commit the next eighteen years of my life to a person who made me feel like human garbage.\n\n\nHe changed his mind last minute and took me to the appointment, and he told me how he had a \u201ccome to Jesus moment,\u201d and realized he loved me and believed that was the right decision. He wouldn\u2019t stop telling me how much he loved me, wanted to marry me, and start our family some day. Then we had another argument.\n\nThe end of our relationship story is I had to wait a day to go to the emergency room(unrelated to the abortion), because my insurance was suspended and I had to wait for the payment to process. He was drunk and said things like\n\n\u201cDo you know how much I love you? I left all of my friends to come here and see you,\u201d\n\nI was in a lot of pain, and had told him six hours prior how bad it was, and he went out to a bar and came to my house around 11:30pm.\n\nAnd then told me I was being rude because I wasn\u2019t responding when he kept saying things like that. He and I got into an argument and he said things like, \u201cat least I can afford insurance.\u201d \n\nI broke up with him two weeks ago when that happened and started looking up narcissism, does this familiar to anyone?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nWhen I was 22 I started dating a guy I met online. He said he was 27 (I found out 3 years later he was actually 43 when we met), and things happened fast with us. He slowly isolated me, and by the end of our five year relationship I was pretty much not aloud to do anything but talk to him, or he would try to kill himself. \n\nMy daily routine was wake up, read the dozens of texts he had sent through the night, call him back after I had slept through his 5+ calls already. Talk him out of the rage he worked himself into through the night, and from my missed calls. Hang up after telling him for the past hour or two that I had to go do stuff around the house, immediately  text him back right after the call ends, try to do what I needed to do (I was starting to become my grandmas care provider) while texting back right away, after 5 texts he would call me because that was his limit of texts. We would talk for another 3 to 4 hours half of the time I would be telling him I needed to get off the phone. This would be the time he plays the pitty card. \"You never talk to me! All you do is sleep or do things with other people!\" He would then work himself into a rage that I would have to calm down. That would be my day until about 8 when I was suppose to start being quite so my family could sleep, but \"all I do is sleep\" so I would have to keep talking and make my family mad. Until about 2 or 3 am. Then I tell him I have to go to sleep, but I stay up and watch some Netflix and just calm myself, and have me time... and then repeat. \n\nI had no friends, I was losing my family, I was stressed all the time, I was slacking on my home duties, I was tired all the time. I had to talk him out of his rage, and talk him out of his suicide attempts.\n\nThe last straw was I was doing something called artist traiding cards, he was all for it until it clicked in his head I was going to traid them. He then accused me of cheating on him by using the cards. Even though the day before I told him that I was going to traid them. It ended up in a couple hours long fight of him telling me I was cheating on him, and me saying you dont trust me... and then i just had enough ans broke up with him. That was almost two years ago...\n\nAnd I am still getting emails from him. \n\nI dont know what to do. I have major PTSD and anxiety from him. I have frequent nightmares of him torturing, stalking, raping me, and more... he stalked my social media until I made all new ones with an all new email. Thankfully he doesn't have this email (he just emails my old address that I still have things connected to and cant switch over, so I still have to check it every few weeks), but I dont know if he found the new social media accounts. I feel like he is watching me even though he is an hour away... but I think he does come to my town. \n\nI dont know what to do. I dont want him emailing me anymore. If I email him back it would just create a bigger problem. He emails me random \"pictures\" he draws, him playing guitar, he send me a photo of a motor bike, then a really weird story about the bike being taken away... I've blocked him but on gmail it just goes to spam. \n\nTL;DR: my ex abusive boyfriend (together for 5 broken up for almost 2) wont stop emailing me. If I email him back it'll make it worse.

You would reveal to us your desire, your love, your hopes, your wants and your dedication.

She had just moved back to my country to study. Somehow on our second date she convinced me to be in a relationship with her. Then she went on a week long trip to Berlin with her roommate. When she came back, some conflict had escalated and her roommate didn't want her to stay with her anymore. I kinda know her roommate and this guy has had his mental health become worse over the last couple of years, so the whole story kinda made sense. \n\nA week later they were supposed to talk to find a solution for the conflict, which ended up being the roommate, a friend of mine and three other people were there, and they demanded that she were to move out the same evening because the conflict had escalated to the point were it was toxic for them to be together under the same roof. She refused and felt harrased, because they couldn't just kick her out because she has a rental contract, which of course is fair and made sense. My friend called me and said that maybe I was able to help because I knew the girl they were trying to evict. I wanted to help, I offered her to stay at my place until she got back on her feet. She still refused to leave the house, and I ended up staying there the whole night waiting for her to make a decision, while the other people kept asking her to leave. During the night the roommate had written a termination of the lease which is legal if you are being harrased by your tenant (both of them accused each other of harrasment). I found it outside her door when I went to the bathroom during the night and gave it to her. In the morning she finally decided to pack her stuff after both of us not sleeping the whole night, she packed her things and we toik a cab to my place.\n\nThe next day she texts me while I am at work about why I didn't show her the eviction note and completely erupts on me, calls me names and demands answers from me, tells me that how can she possibly trust me after this and I am somehow building a case against her with the roommate because I know him and our mutual friend. If the roommate wants to sue her, then every little detail can be used against her I court. I ended up apologising and saying that I made a mistake when I got home and she acted as if nothing happened.\n\nThen she stayed with me for about a week and things were fine, but somehow she made me do a lot of practical stuff for her like finding her a bicycle she could use for transportation. Somehow I kinda felt bad for doing all this stuff for her, cause whenever I said ill do it later or that maybe I don't really feel like it, she would make me feel guilty for it and I would end up doing them anyway. She then went to Berlin, were she had met another person who also offered that she could stay with them. I am generally open to poly relationships as long as I am being offered the same respect as the other person, so I was genuinely happy that she had someone else who also cared about her. The deal was then that she would live in Berlin around a month at a time and stay with me a month at a time cause she said she knew her mental health was bad especially after the eviction night and she didn't want to be a burden to anyone. \n\nAt this point I was almost a little happy for her to leave, cause I thought she would get a break and start putting her life back in order. However, I quickly started seeing signs that she didn't want to improve her situation and take control of her own life. She basically wants the other partner and me to provide for her and would get mad at me when I tried coming up with realistic solutions. She accused me of turning her back on her, retraumatizing her, and she has said on several occasions that I am hard to trust, and that her lovers need to learn fast to embrace all aspects of her (doing her bidding without question) otherwise we ar terrible people. \n\nThis weekend her other partner broke up with her. I don't know the reasons but I imagine the situation is similar to mine. Guess who she blamed for it - me. I am making her mental health worse and that drove her partner away. \n\nI ended up also telling her after having my boundaries disrespected and everything in my my fault that I no longer want to be in a relationship with her. I still tried to be accommodating and said she could stay in my guest room for six months until she got her life back on track. She said she refused to accept this, that she didn't deserve this. Later she said she was hurt, and that I was making a mistake and that she expected us to still share a bed when she came back. Also that she loves me (I've known her a month) and will kiss me when she sees me because she's crazy (her words). At this point I was absolutely fed up and kept telling her no and that she was free to leave at any time if that didn't suit her. She then said that it was abuse that I would make her live in my home, and it would only make it more difficult for her to get her life back on track. She literally called me an abuser for breaking up with her. She then erupted and kept screaming at me that I would welcome her with open arms, warmth and dignity when she is back, and that she will create a shit show like I've never seen if I try to throw her out of my home. And then I would be an abuser like her roommate. I don't even remember how the conversation ended at that point, but she somehow became calm and changed the subject. \n\nShe is still in Berlin and will be back later this month. After processing the things she had said and screamed at me, I took the difficult decision to not have her come back into my home. I wrote that she is not to come back after the things she screamed at me, and that I would no longer reply to her messages unless it was regarding a date for her to come and pick up her stuff. In the mean time I have changed the lock to my apartment, but I still need the key from her to the actual building (haven't told her this). This whole situation is really messing with me, and I keep trying to think of ways to make this situation less painful. I feel terrible for putting her on the street when she was just evicted a month ago, but I've had my boundaries crossed. I'm thinking of ways to lessen the blow by offering her to drop off her things in a location of her choice? Should I do this or should I stick with the original plan of her picking up her stuff herself in front of my building? I keep wondering if maybe I wasn't patient enough or that maybe I'm exaggerating and that it is unfair of me to throw her out while she is in a other country. I keep wondering if maybe I am the abuser here? I feel sick, anxious and unable to sleep. \n\nTl:Dr - trying to remove a possible narc from my life who was evicted from her house a month ago and I said she can't come back to my house.

Things changed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe distanced himself, he became a different person, sometimes behaving as if he was straight and I was disgusting to him. So I moved away and took it as I thought it was - that I was just used.\n\nBut he lingered, we continued chatting and it wasn't long before we were waking up next to each other again - an awkward look on his face, as if he had no recollection of the night before and sought to find the quickest means of getting me out of his apartment.\n\nYet the chatting continued. The flirting continued. The good times continued. We continued. All the while, I just condoned the awkward morning-afters and ghosting now and then.\n\nThings got really awkward when he would ask me to come over (a 30 minute drive, because he didn't have a car) in the middle of the night, and as soon as he was done, would request I either leave or sleep on the couch.\n\nI decided to distance myself and try find something real.\n\nYet he continued being sweet, he admitted he wasn't very emotionally available and that he wanted me around. I lost my temper when I found an opened condom wrapper in his bathroom on morning, after a period that he'd given me the silent treatment - he blamed it on his flatmate.\n\nYet, we continued. I couldn't understand why simply being in his presence was so intoxicating.\n\nMonths passed... Life went on and we were seeing each other about twice a week at least, with each meeting culminating in 'the deed' and ending with an awkward goodbye from his side.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was spending a lot of money on transport and gifts for him at the time. I enjoy buying things for people I care about, or at least I used to, even if it was just paying for dinner. He accepted everything, but I don't remember getting anything back. I'd find things had gone missing or broken, but he didn't seem to care much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found myself in a position where I had to find a place to live and my life went up in the air. I stayed with a friend for about 3 months, when suddenly the big twist - Big asked me to move in with him. Naturally I was excited, he knew I took us really seriously, and I thought it was the first spark of commitment or effort from his side.\n\nMy friends thought it was the worst idea ever. They were right.\n\nIn the first week of living together, we had sex almost every day. He would say things like \"We'll have to stop this sooner or later\" then minutes later we'd be at it again.\n\nAt the end of the first week we went out to party and celebrate the move. At about 1am he had completely vanished. I tried calling, but nothing, so I walked back to the apartment. Arriving home I realized my car wasn't in the garage. I checked inside and my keys had been taken. I tried calling him but no answer.\n\nI was desperate, going to his computer which I noticed was on for answers. Upon waking the screen up I found the website for a local bathhouse/sexclub/steamroom for 'horny gay men looking for a good time'.\n\nI broke down and the notion of this being my reality from now on sent a cold jolt through my very core. 2 hours later he called me to come downstairs and get my car because he had been arrested for drunk driving. I ended up talking the cops out of it by making up a story and when we both got home he said nothing, then made up a story that he had an emergency and had to go see his cousin who was experiencing that stage of their life and they needed a shoulder- or something like that. Of course it was a lie, he was having a good time and took my car, drunk and stoned, to do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I read this back, I can't believe how low my esteem was - accepting and condoning this, thinking I could kill it all with patience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next 5 YEARS of living together, moving to a second apartment building halfway through, we had set up a consistent life together - sex at least twice a week every week; a fluid professional relationship where we developed our respective careers in the same industry; a social life that was just the talk-of-the-town, the life of the party. Things seemed perfect to everyone else, but really he was taking my car for hookups on a regular basis, throwing tantrums if he couldn't get his way. He'd then use me whenever he wanted for whatever reason.\n\nI came home one day to find him 'entertaining' a potential new boy with my TV, Gaming Console, Entertainment and sound system. This was all news to me. There'd be nights when he'd vanish from the club and I've come home to find my room raided, my condoms and lubricant taken and he and another man lying naked, passed out on his bed, completely drunk from the night. That was one example of a nightmare that I was unable to wake from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYet, I forgave. I continued. I found him intoxicating and he would win me over with his charm and false apologies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen things got bad I decided to try dating to get my head into a healthier space - which he got severely jealous of and did his best to sabotage. I went on a great date one day, came home and found him crying on the couch.\n\n\"I can't watch you dating other people.\" he said.\n\nSeveral hours later he committed to me. I was happy.\n\nTwo weeks later he ended it, but not before all the sex and intimacy had come to an awkward, abrupt halt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe emotional yo-yo of him wanting me, while simultaneously dating other people that he would CONSTANTLY brag about was overwhelming. I eventually couldn't have sex with anyone. I felt too insecure. Everything he did, everywhere he went, everyone he dated or hung out with was always better than anyone else. His jealousy was uncontrollable and he was beyond criticism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen things got worse. Yes, you read that right.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne night we were out at the pub, drunk, and I received word that a friend of mine had passed. I told him I was going home. He followed me and stopped me in front of our apartment, at which point he slammed his fist into my face. He pummeled me into the concrete paving outside and attempted to strangle me.\n\nThe following morning I had to take him to the Doctor because he had fucked up his ankle. I was covered in bruises, grazes and cuts and I felt too ashamed to tell anyone at the Doctor's office.\n\nThis happened 4 more times over the next 2 years: Because someone else upset him on his Birthday; Because I had the upper hand in an argument about plain decency between us living together; Because one of his trashy friends almost killed us with bad driving; and because he happily exclaimed that he was going on a date the morning after we were together intimately.\n\n\"But why did you stay with him? Were you a sucker for punishment?\" You ask.\n\nApart from the emotional addiction that I only truly understand now, he had ended up ruining me financially. I was unable to move because I couldn't afford it. Apart from battling to find work, I was hampered by the thoughts of what was happening in my apartment with my things behind my back while I was gone. He drove my car into the ground, destroying the worn brakes completely and leaving me with two flat tires. When the bank came to repossess the vehicle, I was unable to make the payments, repair the car with a maintenance, fix the brakes and the tires. It was a downward spiral that I was taking too lightly because he assured me things were getting better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe'd be dismissive of my successes and times when I needed a shoulder, telling me he was 'sick of my shit', but demanded the utmost attention when he declared the same. He'd be on-and-off about us committing to a relationship until recently when he told me he had to be either drunk or stoned to be with me intimately - a lie, but simply there to hurt me. Sometimes I'd catching holding back a smile when people around him engaged in conflict, or when he would say the most offensive thing to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor 5 long years, I endured this. I believed that I was doing everything wrong, because he told me I was, and so I blamed myself for my own inadequacy. I'd constantly be frantically trying to keep my image clean and look and behave my best in public because that's the standard he expected of me. Who knew what would happen if I didn't uphold it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI became bitter and covertly narcissistic, unable to healthily articulate why I felt like a victim and it resulted in me losing friends. I lost more friends who simply did not want to be around him. He would constantly remind me that his friends were his friends alone, and that they all loathed me, that I was 'too much' to deal with and just an emotional bomb waiting to happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually in 2018, I lost everything. Unemployed and homeless I found myself sleeping where I could to keep myself alive. Moving in with four friends over the course of six months, and staying in any shelter I could find to just stay alive, which I really didn't want to do any more. I was suicidal.\n\nHe had moved to family, had access to a car, the internet, fresh food and big screen HD TVs, along with all his things. Every time we spoke, he would remind me about how much of an ungrateful brat I was being whenever I complained about my situation. Instead I would have to listen to how pricey it is for him to get a haircut was, or how a boy he liked didn't like him back, or how the job application he went for wasn't successful and the would-be employers were just selfish cunts. I wasn't allowed to complain, because I was just being 'too much'. I've also had to pay some of his bills since the accounts are still in my name.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOut of nowhere behaved liked he missed me, and I was so tightly strung around his finger that I fell into his arms once more - we continued our hangouts once to twice a week, then he'd ghost me until he needed me for anything.\n\nWe continued to chat on a daily basis until Christmas 2018. Five years of talking and sharing everyday.\n\nI managed to find a job, which he didn't seem happy about for some reason, so I was focused on getting my shit together, finally acknowledging what had happened, why I had stuck around for so long and that it was time for a change. I divulged nothing to him.\n\nHe said he needed some time to think about things and would be quiet for a few days. A few days passed and he returned back from vacation, finally chatting casually. When he dismissed me just as casually, something... Just... Snapped... Inside me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI saw everything from another perspective. I felt used on every level. I felt like I had destroyed my standards to be with someone who would have thrown me under a bus if it meant they'd get a cheap thrill. I saw a narcissist.\n\nAnd I wasn't prepared to do any more legwork after that.\n\nI went silent.\n\nOn New Years Eve I got a vague \"Hope you're well\" message from him. I have no intention of impolite, so I replied similarly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDays passed. Silence. It was the longest we'd gone without talking. Either he was really going through deep shit or he had found a new, more suitable supply for the attention.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen he suddenly messaged me about movie ticket prices. I remained completely neutral, not engaging as I usually did. Without me initiating the actual arrangement, the conversation went nowhere. I was also pretty angry. He would send me memes hinting towards having sex again, but I didn't want to feel used any more.\n\nHe clearly got bored and left me alone after that, and I began missing him. Like to the point of battling to breathe.\n\nI messaged him asking why he tried to initiate all of this without follow-through and he replied that he didn't want to yet because he was still going through things. I knew he was lying - he's a very convincing liar to those who don't know him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's attractive, he looks after himself, he's loved by friends and people he works with, but they are seeing a different person. I don't know that person anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe hadn't spoken in 3 weeks, and I got a few cold, stoic emotionless emails from him the other day regarding work. He addressed me as someone would a client or a colleague that was in another department. It was quite shocking to see such a change. It left me shaking with simultaneous anger and sadness. I blamed myself for everything.\n\nI still haven't replied.\n\nI used to look really hard to see the good in people. I've even seen it in him. But having gone through everything over the last few years I don't know how to stop the pain of the hurtful memories. There were really good times too, but I battle to remember them because they were always tarnished by something... Either a selfish act or a hurtful statement brushed off as banter and if I reacted I was 'taking it too personally'.\n\nI'm at the stage where I miss him intensely, but I'm afraid to contact him again because it feels like it just might hurt a little more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm posting this as a warning for anyone thinking they may be at the mercy of narcissistic abuse - GET CLEAR NOW.

I also remember another man but I thought it was a dream for a while; however, I remember vividly that I talked about it with my parents when I was a child but they didn't listen to me, so I shut up about it for years. \n My cousin (12M at that time?) did it four or five times (?) to me, but I didn't understand, he told me it was a daddy-mommy-play. So, I accepted, deep down I knew something was off, but I accepted nonetheless.\n\nThen at the age of 13, I had to do a medical examination. Everybody talked about virginity being highly looked up in women. They said the doctor would know it right away. They said women who no longer were virgin would never have a family and suffer in their marriage. They also said those women would end up in hell. I asked what it was, and they explained it roughly. My whole being was devastated because I was a sinner, I would be abandoned by my family the moment they would know about it. \n\nI was a talkative kid and I was so happy. However, when the truth clicked in my head, I shut down. I couldn't get my mind out of it. I told my friend and she was supportive at some points. But whatever she said, I couldn't go back to my old self. I hid my body in layers of clothes because I was afraid people would see it from afar. I began slouching to hide the fact I was feminine. I found comfort in food. I couldn't tell my parents, they already didn't listen to me in the past, why would they now?\n\nThen at 17, I got a boyfriend, a childhood friend. I couldn't bring myself to be serious about him. The moment he would know my secrets, he would leave me too and he would spread it everywhere. So I broke up with him after only two months. \nAt 18, I moved from my country and lived a bit secluded, still ashamed. After a year, I broke down and talked to my mother about my past. She told me it was okay, that I had to ask for forgiveness from God, that I sinned. \nBut was it a sin, even if I didn't know what I had done? Was it my fault at 7? What did I do so wrong to be a sinner? I already labelled myself as a sinner for so long, why would her treat me as such too??? \nI lost hope that day. I hated the whole universe for throwing it at me like that. \n\nAm now 22. I still can't forget about it. I still am afraid of having a partner. I'm still searching comfort in food.

When we're outsideI would try to make a conversation with her about how our relationship isn't so great but she would always start taking about how one time I got angry at her because she joked about something, or she'd simply ignore what I just said and walk in silence in the end I get frustrated and raise my voice she then says that I embarrass her publicly and that I have to walk home by myself and she'll take the train. Even if I try to start talking about this calmly she always ends up blaming me for something or ignoring what I just said like before, it doesn't matter if I'm calm or not, she thinks that I'm the only one who acts badly.

Narcissists often act like they know people so well when the truth is, they have *no clue whatsoever* about the people around them and what makes them tick. They will say something like, \"Oh, yeah, Joe loves his job. He really gets into it.\" When the reality is that Joe absolutely hates his job and this is glaringly obvious to anyone that interacts with him.\n\nBut that's the thing. Narcissists don't really interact with you. They might talk AT you, and project what and who they *want* you to be onto you, but they don't really listen to you. They aren't really interested in what you're thinking, feeling, or needing. They don't really care to get to know you as a person. It's like they paint over reality in whatever way suits them in the moment. It doesn't matter to them what reality actually is.\n\nAnd yet they'll sit there and act like the two of you are best friends. They'll talk about you like they know you inside and out, are familiar with all your motivations, and know exactly what's best for you. But none of this is true, and none of it is based on facts. And this is what makes narcissists dangerous. Because they don't deal in *reality*. It's like the narcissistic mother who keeps buying her daughter the same type of gift since she was 13 years old. Or the narcissistic spouse who constantly accuses you of thinking things that you would never in a million years think. It's all about what THEY feel and what THEY want - it has nothing whatsoever to do with you. Nothing.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I've had multiple counsellors and therapists over the years, but my college counsellor said something I've never heard from a professional before: something i thought i was faking.\n\nThat my mother is emotionally abusive.\n\nsome background. she comes from a broken household, has anxiety, depression, and fibromyalsia. she has issues controlling her anger. She only had help for her anxiety for the first 12-13 years of my life. I have persistent depressive disorder, autism, ptsd from COCSA, i dissociate, and have hints of a personality disorder.\n\nShe would yell at my father, at me for small things. I was suicidal by 7 years old and I would cower at her yelling. She forced me into christianity and terrified me that my dad, who didnt have a religion, would be going to hell and made me pray for him out of terror. i would write that i wanted to die on papers and tape them up in my room at age 7, i felt empty and dead. Whenever I cried or didn't want something, she would scream. Me, doing something any kid does would lead to screaming and screaming.\n\nI told her I wanted to die while I was dragged to church, and thats when the first big memory pops up. In the car after I told her I wanted to die, she exploded. Screamed that it was unchristianly, that I would go to hell, that I was just faking it to get out of church or to get attention. Needless to say, I kept that inside after that.\n\nAnother big memory is of me being scared because we had fleas in the house and i had seen one jump across my bed. I was around 11 or 12? I got up, shuffling out of bed and fearfully admitted that I was scared and she exploded again. Bringing up our Camper bed, she called me names, insulted everything about me, swore, the whole lot. The worst time happened at around 13 or 14. She'd had a bad day and asked if i wanted McDonalds. I said I wasn't sure and she EXPLODED. Because i didn't want fucking McDonalds. Screaming, yelling, stomping, slamming, it got so bad my dad pulled me into our downstair basement and had me call a friend to stay with for the night while she calmed down.\n\nAt age 15, I had a breakdown at church.\n\n due to my hypersensitivity to noise from my autism. I hid under the table, rocked, and cried and kept saying it was too loud. Instead of trying to help, she started screaming, telling me to stop ruining it for everyone, and called me 'fucking nuts', before taking me to the hospital and trying to get me forcefully put in the psych ward for having a breakdown. She still denies that she called me 'fucking nuts', but I remember it. I repeated it to myself, thats the only reason I know it's real.\n\nWhenever I told a therapist or counsellor something she was doing was making me suicidal, she would call me manipulative, say I was doing it to control her. She would say it even though my middle school abusers used that exact word to describe me.\n\nThose are just the big events. She'd go between great and awful- on bad days, if i even walked in front of her and got in her way for a millisecond I would be subject to extreme passive aggressive behaviour or an explosion. When she rarely explodes now I tip toe and hide upstairs like I used to.\n\nBoth of my parents made fun of me for flinching and apologizing rapidly, mocking me and telling me to stop 'acting like an abused puppy' many times. \n\nShe ha a passive aggressive mode, when anything could set her off when she's angry. I'm hyper aware of it. Whenever I mess up I have to apologize over and over. I can't cry unless I'm overwhelmed or my parents are screaming. Any loud voice I interpret as angry- they don't like that.\n\nMy mother has changed though. her explosions are less frequent, she actually acknowledged the fact that she made it impossible for me to cry unless certain circumstances are applied, she helped me figure out i'm a victim of COCSA. But still, when something stresses her out at work and she has the passive aggressive movement, the stance, the stomping... I'm suddenly emotionally that eight year old, tiptoeing and not going down to eat lumch until 2 pm when she stops stomping out of fear.\n\nI'm 17 now, and it's gone down significantly. I still cower when my boyfriend is angry, I cry when anyone yells, I think me asking for things is manipulation... It's hard. I'm getting both a high school diploma and a transfer degree this year. I'm looking into an amazing program for my dream job- but I still rely on her financially and physically. I don't know if I can survive this aftermath and the residual effects anymore.\n\nAm I over reacting? Am I just oversensitive? How can I survive the aftermath of this? \n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, she is dangling,my medically necessary transition over my head in order to try and 'make me christian again' after she thoroughly traumatized me with it.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Needless to say this was incredibly upsetting to hear as I was doing my best to get things ready for the baby, and doing it by myself too. He goes between telling me to rest to telling me I don't have enough done but won't help with anything else, or makes it a huge issue.\n\nToday though I had to go to an appointment.

I failed my driving test last year and honestly didn't try hard enough after that to pass, I let it slide).\n\nWhile we were parked up I went to get coffee and a sandwich for him. Got back and he said the coffee is leaking, I didn't put the lid on properly.

After telling me again that it was leaking he took the cup and tilted it over my leg in the car, causing shove off it to soak my leg. I got upset as to why he would do that intentionally, he said yes, it was intentional but he didn't mean for that much to spill. He then proceeded to tell me how useless I was because I didn't know where the place I was going to get my hair cut was. When I again got upset, he told me how I have the emotional maturity of a 6 year old and how he can't do anything to me without me getting upset. I was then told to \"just shut up\" when I started asking questions. We parked, I asked did he really not want the rest of his coffee (he had not had anything to eat or drink and it was almost noon), so he poured his coffee out on the ground and told me to get out of the car.\n\nDon't really know what to think, or how to proceed this.

Now she says it about another and I'm not sure", "author": "probableliarbut", "self_text": "So, to sum up:\n\nI'm going through a divorce. When I discovered that my wife was cheating on me she left to be with the other man. I filed for divorce the next day but it's a long process. It's been months, and will still take some. As the divorce process was legally started I'm not legally expected anymore to support her as a spouse, so it's not much about my legal duties that I'm speaking.\n\nWhen she left with the other man she started to tell everyone that I was physically abusive to her, throughout our marriage, for many years. That is a complete fabrication. I have absolutely never been physical with her, in any way, shape or form, nothing strong, nothing light, nothing. On the day of the confrontation of her adultery, I was enraged and was verbally very abusive. I am not ashamed of that. It's a healthily human reaction to what she did to me. That rage that included verbal abuse lasted for about three hours in the afternoon of one day. Afterwards she left and ceased to exist to me, I just wanted my freedom. I suppose it would make sense for one to be fearful, during the rage, of the possibility that the abuse could become physical. The reality though is that I never physically abused her, whether or not it may be understandable to have been afraid I could have at that time. I also was never abusive in any other form but at that enraged time. No verbal abuse, no emotional abuse, nothing. But I'm aware that some people will say that abusive people don't realize they're abusive so whatever. It stays that physical abuse has never existed, but she has told a lot of people that it existed for most of our marriage.\n\nAll this to explain that I know, with absolute certainty, for a proven fact, that she has a recent history of lying about being physically abused. And as an aside, she knows that I know.\n\nNow here are the recent news:\n\nYesterday she texted me to tell me the new guy is beating her. I told her she told the same about me and we both know how true that was. She told me but with him, it's true. I told her that she's not my problem anymore and that I happened to not believe her, but that what I think doesn't matter as I don't want her best interest in the first place. She said that she had no one else to turn to, because ironically no one would believe her that both men would beat her up, and I'm the only one who knows the truth. She cried virtual tears for help, claiming she doesn't know what to do.\n\nI'm not sure what to make of that. I know damn well that there are men she accused of beating her up and it was a complete lie. I think she probably is right that with her history of lying no one will continue to believe her if she tells the latest one is beating her, whether he is or not. Fundamentally if she was telling the truth for once she should go to the police but I know her and I can see how she would be irrationally afraid and would need support, but meh, doesn't mean I believe her.\n\nI have no sort of thought like the guy would never do that. Quite the contrary. He was aware that they were cheating, and my findings tell me that cheaters are essentially losers all the way through, and that you'll always find out they're even lower than you thought the more to dig up and find out about them. He could totally be a woman beater, no problem with that. The problem is that so far, when she told that a man was beating her, it was a lie. So it would be rather ridiculous to believe her just like that.\n\nNot sure if I'm supposed to react to this supposed cry for help.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Last night I heard my step dad threaten my mom that he would beat the shit out of her if she didn\u2019t shut the fuck up, she kept talking and then I started hearing sounds like he was hitting her and she started yelling for him to stop because she was bleeding to which he replied again that she had to shut the fuck up or he would beat her up completely. So this morning I told my school just that. I had recently given my school counselor my aunts phone number to make an appointment to talk about my situation at home with the hitting (of me)  and how unhappy I feel, the appointment would\u2019ve taken place in two weeks. But after I told my school counselor this she told me she had to call my aunt again to ask her if she could come today, which she did. Then I heard that my counselor had to tell this institution for child safety and they also came to the talk, which turned into them first calling my mom up to tell her about all of this. I then received a nasty ass text from my step dad about \u201cwhere he could complain about being treated as a kid by me and that he forgives me bc he loves me but that I have to come home because I can\u2019t do this to my mom\u201d after all that was done they left to go talk to my parents and picked up my stuff for me which I wasn\u2019t allowed to do on my own anymore. I am going to live with my aunt for at least a while and my parents did express that they\u2019re willing to get help and they didn\u2019t deny anything I said. I\u2019m pretty scared about having to go back if that ends up happening but at least I\u2019m safe for now. This has been a hell of a day. I didn\u2019t have a say in any of it either because they considered my home unsafe and they had to inform my parents. I would appreciate any advice on how to deal with the situation, I\u2019ve been feeling very guilty because they told me my mom was a mess and kept packing stuff for me that I might need (she even gave me this framed letter I had hanging in my room which made me cry). I hope I did the right thing but I can\u2019t help but feel bad about it. My step dad definitely showed that he\u2019s an asshole with his text but my mom was very understanding and asked if we could get coffee when I\u2019m ready to do so. Thank u for reading, I hope it\u2019s going to get better now. I would love to hear advice or stories.\n\nTl;dr I told the school about my step dad hitting my mom and they already knew about both my parents hitting me. A child safety team got involved and I\u2019m now living with my aunt for a while, they told my parents and I feel kind of guilty because my mom is incredibly upset.

Advice Needed.", "author": "abuse_throwaway_87", "self_text": "TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI met my ex-boyfriend online during a very dark period in my life. I moved to a new state in September for a new full-time job but ended up getting demoted a few weeks after I started to 20 hrs a week because they were hemorrhaging money (lost three major contracts/clients) which was not enough to survive o. They laid off a bunch of people and cut hours for a lot more. They begged me to stay on until the new year and I would get full-time again. Since I had already moved over 1000 miles I decided to just say fuck it and stay. Work for them while finding another job just in case the full-time offer for January didn't fall through. That being said, I was broke and homeless; I had planned on staying in a motel then getting an apartment but after the hours were cut, i barely had enough to survive. I was severely depressed and borderline suicidal but I used alcohol and drugs to numb the pain. I didn't want my family or friends back home to be disappointed in me. I didn't want to seem like a failure. \n\nI met my boyfriend from a post I made about needing a room to rent. We bonded over drugs and alcohol and I ended up moving in literally one week after we met. Obviously that was a red flag. I found out after moving in that his DOC was crack cocaine and had an at least $100 a day habit. He didn't sleep for days sometimes and would get super paranoid. My DOC is alcohol and powder coke, but I am mainly a heavy drinker because I can't afford a coke habit.\n\nI was barely making enough to pay my car insurance and phone bill at my job so he forced me into selling my body to men to pay for his crack habit. He was verbally and emotionally abusive and it was a nightmare. He would wake me up at all hours and make me have sex with men in his living room and then take all of the money. I probably saw about 100 people and never got to keep a dime. He claims that I owe him thousands of dollars for him letting me stay in his shitty section 8 apartment. He buys crack every single day and then I got hooked on smoking it for a bit to try and please him but luckily i didn't like it so i have no urge to smoke it. \n\nI finally was able to get away from him for a few days ago and stay with a coworker. I didn't initially tell her about this guy until one night, I just told her everything in between sobbing my eyes out. She opened my eyes to how messed up this situation is and that I needed to get away and that he was using me. \n\nI told him via text that I wasn't coming back to his place today and was going to stay with my coworker. Now he is threatening to send my job, family, and friends the posts he put up with my face on it where he would have me sell my body for his drugs. He also called my job and told the receptionist that \"you all have a dirty prostitute (my name) working there\" and hung up. He knows where my coworker's father's restaurant is and is threatening to send men there to beat her father up as penance for her letting me stay with her. \n\nI literally am suicidal. I don't know what to do. My stuff is still there and my work laptop is still at his place. Is there a way I can get my stuff with a police escort? He hasn't hit me but he has threatened me in person and via text message several times. He is also threatening to send people to my job and beat me up. I am so scared. I am not sure what to do. His baby's mother also texted me and told me I better come back or it's over for me. I think he is using her phone to text me because I blocked him. I've met her a few times and she doesn't seem like the type to threaten but she still hangs out and smokes crack with him so I don't know....\n\nHe said that I would be nothing without him and that he will make sure I am nothing if I leave him. He told me if I don't come back by 5pm today, he will ruin my life. I am so scared. I have no money and my full-time hours at work don't start until January 20th. I need advice on what to do. How can I make him stop this? How can I get away from this sick man??? I am at my wits end and I don't know what to do.\n\nI have been drug and alcohol free for two weeks now. Even before I left him, he was enraged when I decided to get clean and stop partying hard with him. He tried to sabotage that several times but I care too much about being sober now. I am planning on attending NA and AA meetings next week after work and make it a weekly thing. \n\nTLDR: Abusive ex boyfriend who pimped me out is threatening to expose my drug use and prostitution to my family and friends if I try to leave him. My stuff is still at his place. I'm scared and stressed and never experienced this before. ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He knows I don't feel comfortable and yet tells me if I feel threatened to step up my game. What have I done in my life to deserve this. I feel so broken and unwanted I just don't care anymore.

I'm (40/F) still struggling with the truth of that.\n\nWhen it started, I was already breaking two of the cardinal rules of dating and relationships:\n\n1. Don't get involved with your boss.\n2. Don't get involved with a married man.\n\nThere was an imbalance of power from the start: as my boss, he (54/M) had power over my world in ways that narcissistic sociopaths like him always misuse. As things between us carried on in the exciting \"honeymoon phase,\" I was blind to his true nature and naively trusted every slick word out of his mouth about how he \"wanted to take care of me,\" and, how he \"considered me a partner [in life and in his business],\" and, all of the other empty words designed to appeal to my desperate desire to be accepted, included, chosen, and, respected. And, so, I broke the next cardinal rule:\n\n3. Don't hand your life over to someone (especially a narcissistic sociopath) completely.\n\nBut, of course, I bought into every lie he told me about how I could trust him with me, and, how he had my best interests at heart, and, how all I needed was him. By the time he started devaluing me and showing his true colors, every aspect of my life was tied up in him (my job, my financial stability, my heart, my spirit..). This made it all the more devastating when he spent the next 3 years yelling at me every other day with false accusations of \"trying to take him for all he was worth,\" and, trying to \"singlehandedly take down his company,\" when his constant workplace abuse wore me down to the point that I had to work from home, and, made silly mistakes far too often. He emotionally battered me, I fell apart, and, then, out of nowhere, he fired me in a desperate attempt to win his wife back.\n\nYet, he STILL insisted that he \"loved\" me, and, that we were \"soulmates\" and each others' \"One.\"\n\nI don't know WHY I stayed after that. I know it had alot to do with the traumatic grief of my daughter being manipulated away from me by NMom and NSis a year into me working for him and being involved with him - I died when they took her, and, I know that I haven't been the same since. (If you want to know that part of my story, it's in a previous post.) It might also have something to do with me feeling like he was the only one left in my life who cared about me at ALL once my daughter was turned against me and I was erased from the rest of my family - which was hard to swallow given the way he had destroyed my life by callously and wrongfully firing me. All I know is that I was a shadow of who I used to be, and, I felt so lost and abandoned and willing to hang on to him despite the things he had already done to me and to my life that shattered me.\n\nArguing with him - which is what our \"relationship\" devolved into after he ruined my financial security - was always confusing, and, crazy-making, and, dizzying, and, destructive to my spirit. Everything I have read about all of the tactics sociopaths and narcissists use to manipulate, he DID (projecting, word-salad, circular arguments, shaming, name-calling, outright denial, stone-walling, the silent treatment, etc.). And, I walked away from each of those arguments more damaged, and, hurt, and, broken than before.\n\nI could spend a year listing all of the horrible things he's said to me over the last almost-6 years.. just to serve as an example, here are some that stick out in my head at the moment:\n\n\u2022 \"Now, I understand why people treat you like shit: you basically ask for it.\"\n\u2022 \"You pathetic piece of shit - you clearly deserved to have your daughter abandon you.\"\n\u2022 \"All you do is spread your legs for anyone with a cock and a dollar.\"\n\nAnd, the gaslighting. OMIGOD, the gaslighting. He was a consummate professional gaslighter. That was the first of his manipulative tricks to use on me - and, never stopped for the almost-6 years we were \"together.\"\n\n(There was physical abuse, as well. And, most recently, increasing sexual abuse. I'll leave those for another post.)\n\nYet, every single time he came hoovering, I blindly and stupidly fell for it. No matter HOW cruel and vicious he'd become. My self-worth and self-esteem and dignity had been eroded so terribly that just one halfway nice word from him was enough to lure me back in.\n\nWe've broken up and gotten back together more times than I have fingers or toes. He's let me live with him at least 3 times (I'm homeless due to the devastation of him firing me), and, each of those times, he has gladly and callously thrown me out onto the street and then laughed in my face for being there.\n\nA little more than a year ago, I found out that he had already replaced me with his new victim. That didn't matter to him, though - he still had me convinced that *I* was his \"true love,\" and, kept me around as his side-piece still while he wooed HER and was proud to be seen in public with HER and allowed HER to physically assault me twice and then defended HER to me.\n\nOnce he threw me away for HER the first time, he somehow manufactured a sick game of leaving HER for me, getting sick of me again and leaving me for HER, and, back and forth and back and forth for this past year and a half. Almost on a monthly basis - kinda felt like I could predict when he would come back to me by comparing it to when I'd last had my damn period each time.\n\nBut, the more he went back and forth, the more vicious and hateful he was to me each time he threw me away for HER again, further eroding my sense of self and shattering my spirit. Maybe that's why it was so easy for him to con his way back in my life each time he'd hoover again: my soul and spirit were so eviscerated that I no longer felt capable of protecting myself from him.\n\nI have yet to succeed at No Contact. While I consider us to be done (yet AGAIN), I have lost the strength and the will to be strong in the event that he comes back hoovering. \n\nIt just all feels futile.\n\nI've lost everything: my home, my job, my car, my DIGNITY.. and, I feel so defeated and hopeless and powerless, that the thought of recovering from his incessant cruelty seems nearly impossible at best.\n\nIf you've made it this far, I really do appreciate it.\n\nAnd, if it's any help: reading this to myself is eye-opening, to say the least. I am truly astounded at the things I tolerated, or, excused.. at all the abject LIES I believed.. at the depth of depravity I allowed him to heap upon me..\n\nI don't even know if I'm asking a question..", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don\u2019t speak up for myself, I don\u2019t chime in on conversation anymore in fear of being criticized, if something is bothering me I shut it all out and isolate myself, etc. I realize these behaviors aren\u2019t healthy and I\u2019m ready to take my life back. The first step in doing so is to finally tell my story to a group who will understand. \n\n\n\nI was with my N-ex for 3 1/2 years. We started dating in high school. He was my first love. The first few months were wonderful, like in most narc and empath relationships, and then things took a horrific turn. \n\n\n\n- He gaslit me into believing I was insane and even convinced me that I had anger issues and to seek counseling. \n- He had a severe opiate and alcohol addiction and kept it from me for a long time, and then blamed me for it. (Even though he\u2019d been using drugs since the age of 12 or 13, long before we got together.) \n- He made me believe that his parents were like dictators and didn\u2019t like me, even though this was far from the truth and were actually very lenient and nice people. \n- He lied to me for 3 months about being \u201cgrounded,\u201d and that his parents weren\u2019t allowing him to see me, but later on it came out that he had gotten the word \u201cLOL\u201d tattooed above his penis and didn\u2019t want me to find out about it. Later on I also found out that he had lied about who gave him the tattoo. \n- Told me that when he overdosed on painkillers the only thing he was thinking about was what lie he was going to tell to keep it from me. \n- Always lied to me about where he was at. Would make plans with his \u201cfriends\u201d, and then tell me he was on the way to my house to hang out, but then would turn his phone off and leave me hanging for hours on end. \n- Held a gun to his head when I was at his house, and told me that he wanted to \u201csee the expression on my face when he blew his brains out in the last split second that he was alive.\u201d\n- Physically abused me. On one occasion, I grabbed his phone to call my mom because mine was dead, and he pulled my arm behind my pack and twisted it, resulting in a fracture. Just to get his phone out of my hand. \n- My junior year I studied abroad in Germany for a summer. I asked him to ride to the airport with me and my parents on my departure date. He backed out at the last minute. Didn\u2019t speak to me the whole day of my departure. \n- Didn\u2019t skype or call me once the whole time I was in Germany. Later told me it was because he didn\u2019t like that I was in a country with \u201cmuslim terrorists.\u201d \n- Carved swastikas (Nazi symbols) all over his body with a razor pocket knife. \n- He still paints me as the crazy ex gf on social media even though we have been no contact for over a year. \n\n\n\nThis is only about 1/8th of the events that happened in our relationship. There is so much more that it\u2019d  take me hours to type out. I underwent extreme mental and physical abuse at such a young age. I sometimes question why I had to go through something so painful, so young. Hopefully one day I will be able to say that all of the abuse no longer affects me or makes me upset. I still cry about it sometimes. \n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I feel that maybe, until the kids are older and stronger, perhaps I should just leave well enough alone. The problem with that is I'm just stuck in limbo. I will have to stay in hiding and look over my shoulder for the next several years. This is no way to live. I'm not sure it would be prudent to let my guard down, not at all.

I am a 19 year old male, though when the abused started I was 14 and it ended when he suddenly died when I was 16.\nThe abuse began when I was 14, I was excited to be going to my grandads, or poppa as I called him, house for a week during the Easter break. The first two days at the house was uneventful. However early in the morning on the third day a knock on my bedroom door woke me up. My Grandad entered and asked if I wanted some morning cuddles. Confused due to the fact it was early morning, around 7 I was still sleepy and didn't say anything as he climbed into the single bed. I should point out now that, at the time I was a slim 14 Yr old boy with not much muscle on him at all, whilst my grandad was man in his 60's who was in o way muscular either, but still much stronger than me, or so it felt. When he got in the bed I shuffled closer to the other end, though as a small single bed, it placed us in an uncomfortably close spinning position with his arm over my body, pinning me to the bed. I don't know what his intentions were when he came into the room originally as it took a couple of minutes until the arm that was pinning me to move down my chest and try and make its way down my pyjama bottoms. I felt it going down so I attmdpted to stop it with my own hand, but after a while I could not do enough to stop him. I then lay thee silent to the world as he touched my penis, making it hard, as I felt his own erect penis against my back. In my head I was panicking, wondering what if I could get out, but I was still and unmoving with the words, don't cum constantly repeating in my mind. I can't remeber how long this lasted, but I didn't cum and eventually he got out of the bed and left, heading down stairs. I lay in that bed for an hour, wondering what had happened. When I eventually felt able to move agian I went down stairs expecting him to talk to me, to tell me to be quiet, but all he asked me was what I wanted for breakfast. I was so confused. I wondered if it was real, it felt real and the feeling of confusion and disgust felt real. Afterwards my parent called the house, asking if we want to join them in a day trip and I could cut the week at my grandads short if I wanted to. I agreed, and as he drove me to meet up with my parents all I could think about was that I would tell them, they would get to know and they could help me. When we reached my parents it raining so we decided to go back home and just spend the day inside and talking. When I was home I packed all my stuff away and went to head downstairs to expose my grandad to my parents, I needed to tell them. However on the stairs I stopped to listen to their conversation and they were laughing and talking to him. I was angry as they were talking to the person who hurt me but then all the desire to tell them vanished I became worried, I didn't want to break up my family. I didn't want my Mum to loose her Dad (her mum and my Nan dies a few years before of cancer). I convinced myself I didn't want to ruin my family. So I head back upstairs and lay in bed. Though he never crept in bed with me every again, it did not mean that the abuse stopped there.\nAs I mentioned my grandad had lost his wife to cancer, so my mum decided to help him feel less lonely by inviting him over to our home every Wednesday. I was forced to sit next to him everytime. And when we were alone  and no one else is in the room, he would put his hands down my Trousers and touch me again. Almost every Wednesday. Over time he grew more bold, and would do it when my parents were in the room, none of them noticing as I screamed to them in my mind to rescue me. My parents scolded me for being 'selfish' for trying to stay in my room when he came over, forcing me to sit next to him. Over time I became more and more withdrawn, the few friends I had I hid myself from. As the abuse continues I his from my family as well, I stopped talking to my brothers and my parents. Stopped trusting them because I could not believe that they were letting it happen, even though I had never told them. The worst part was, that after every Wednesday I would repress the memories and the feelings of what had happened to me. I hated myself, I felt like all I had was myself to blame as I never told anyone. I tried to tell my parents a few times, however they are strict people and a majority of conversation I had with them was them scolding me, making me doubt myself further and making it almost impossible to tell them the truth.\nWhen I was 16 I started dating my current girlfriend and love of my life :) during the first 4months of the relationship she did not know of the abuse I sufferee, and continued to suffer at his hands. I didn't want her to think less of me. However on one random day in January he suddenly died from a blot clot or something in his own home. When I got home from college the day hev died my parent told me, and were so sad, my family were all so sad. I was shocked, I threw my hand over my mouth to stop me from laughing and acted sad so they wouldn't know the relief that I felt all over my body. However relief quickly became anger, everyone we talked to praised how good of a person he was, my mum only wanted to talk about him and it wa s breaking me down. I though I had escaped him, I thought that with all the years of repression that the memories would stay locked away forever. But everytime they mentioned his name I was back in the bed at his house. I had to tell someone, so I told my gf. I trusted her, I saw her as the only person I could talk to about it. And instead of being disgusted with me as I thought she would, she cried with me and held me. She helped me stay sane as every person in the world was praising my abuser.\nIt would be many more months before I would eventually tell my parents, however I was forced to. My gf had also been a victim of sexual abuse and it had a bad effect on her, some nights she would be crying all alone at her house and I felt like it was my duty to at least be there so I could help her as she helped me. However this would happen late at night, and my ever strict parent still had me on a bedtime of 10pm, even at the age of 16. And as the only people who could drive me to her house at midnight they soon became irritated. One day my mum pulled me aside and told me how I in no way knew what she was going to threw and how I could not help one bit and that she needed professional help. And though it was true that I could not magically cure her of her problems, being there with her helped her feels safe just as her being there for me helped me. Eventually I felt so pressured that I had to shout it at her, what had a happened to me. She stopped and went quiet and sat down. It broke her, her father had died and now she had to hate him because of what he did to me. In a moment that should have been a relief to me however I was hit with a big revelation, According to my mother this was not the first time someone had said something like that about my grandad. The relief of telling her quickly twisted into anger and betrayal. As I tried. To comfort my crying mother all I could think was that she let me and my brothers near this person, this person who had done this before to someone else. It hurt a lot\nAfter it all came out, my parents were in chaos. As I thought so long ago at the age of 14, it did break them. My parents each Decided to go to counselling and my younger brothers were discreetly questioned to see if the same had happened to them (thankfully not). Life however is not back to normal, I don't trust my parents. Though it is not their fault, yyears of being touched whilst they were in the room, blind to it and finding out they knew that he had done it in the past means that whilst I try to be a good son, i still do not feel comfortable around them. My brothers I hardly interact with as well, during the time of the abuse I tried to isolate myself from them like I was a disease. And it worked two well, though they say they miss my presence I've missed so much that I barely feel like their family anymore. The only person I do trust is my gf, and though I still have days where alli can remeber is his hand touching me, I know that she will. Be there for me.\n\nSorry for writing a small book, it is late at night for me and I needed to get my thoughts about it off my chest. I've received some counselling for this but I amnot good about speaking about how I feel about things, so I ultimately gave up. I feel like a normal person again. Having my gf really helped as I have a person I can genuinely trust and I knoe won't hurt me. And though the effects of my grandad left scars on myself and my family I hope that by the time I have my own kids all of this will be the furthest thing from my mind. Thank you.

{"post_id": "af4yfy", "created_utc": 1547275920, "title": "My sister is driving me insane!", "author": "ActivistVictor", "self_text": "She is one of the most entitled and least remorseful clowns I've ever seen. She constantly hurts my feelings and shoots down any new ambitions I get, making me feel hopeless in the process, and never shows the slightest hint of remorse for doing so, even on the multiple occasions I've told her I don't like what she does. She even has a cowardly little routine she does to ensure she never owns up to anything. She hurts me, I call her out and tell her she did, she refuses to address it or apologize, and then when I try to resolve the issue and reach closure the next day, she throws the blame in my face and accuses ME of 'picking fights' (even though that's not even remotely accurate, as to pick a fight implies you're creating a problem when none existed before, whereas I'm trying to resolve a preexisting problem). In this way, she constantly makes herself seem like a saint, who can do no wrong, and implies that I'm wrong for daring to even raise a finger against her. And because my parents enable the heck out of her, and constantly side with her against me in a cowardly 3 vs 1 alliance, I am always painted to be in the wrong every time, and I never get an apology for any of their actions, or even the slightest bit of remorse for routinely plunging me into a depression and destroying my motivation, as well as making me feel truly and utterly alone. In fact, I can think of two times she's apologized (one of which she was put up to) in the past decade, and the worst part is that she constantly sites this insincere apology when I call her out, and acts as though because she did this years ago, she doesn't have to apologize now, despite making no attempt to change her behavior since then.\n\nOne example I can think of lately where she did this routine was a time I was taking a brief nap on the couch, (something I had only done twice in the past year), and she came into the room and wanted to watch tv. There were two vacant chairs nearby, both of which were well within sight of the TV, and you'd think any reasonable person would just take those that one time, at least until I woke up. But no, she decided she was entitled to the couch, and demanded I moved, and upon my refusal, she promptly sat on my legs and forced me to move out of the way. Needless to say, I was furious, as I presume she herself would be if I tried to do that to her. However, when I called her out for it to demand she apologize, she kept trying to call ME selfish for sleeping there in the first place (hypocritical if you ask me, since even if she was right, it's certainly no less selfish than claiming an occupied couch spot as your own when you could easily just sit elsewhere that one time.) And worse still, as usual, my parents yet again sided with her, and blamed me, even though she was the one who had disturbed me. Eventually, I, after trying and failing to get them to see any part of my argument, and getting ever more enraged at their outright refusal to hear my side, of even listen to me in general, eventually made the mature decision to leave the situation, and took a walk to cool my head, determined to resolve the problem later once my anger had subsided. But of course, the next day when I tried to address the problem, and get that closure I so desperately wanted, once again, she accused me of picking fights, and refused to address it in the slightest, once again making me feel hopeless and alone.\n\nNow you might ask, why not just leave, and believe me, I desperately want to. However, so far, this has proven impossible, as I don't make nearly enough money to go out solo, and virtually none of my friends who i've told about my situation have helped me in the slightest, be it by offering me a place to stay, offering to room with me and split costs, or even just giving me someone to talk to so I can vent. And I haven't switched careers yet, because every time I come up with something I might want to do, I make the error of mentioning it around my sister, who promptly comes up with a bunch of reasons she won't think it will work, and inevitably makes me feel so hopeless that I convince myself it won't work too, so I don't even try. And the real kicker of this situation is, on the multiple occasions I've tried to voice my hopelessness, such as my sometimes saying that I feel like I'm sinking on the titanic, to hopefully get some help or even some compassion, it's fallen on deaf ears. And worse still, once my sister even had the gall to tell me that saying I felt like I was sinking on the Titanic was offensive (without even trying to make any attempt to understand why I was saying it), which made me feel even worse than I had before.\n\nTL:DR I really don't know what to do about this situation, I have nowhere I can move, and virtually no one who is going to help me, or even just let me talk to them about it even my so called friends.

Have been reading up on narcisissm and feel like this might be key to understanding this whole situation. So if anyone on here can offer any advice, input, ... whatever ... it'd be REALLY appreciated. Thank you so much in advance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I'm a pretty normal young woman, I like to think. I met this guy a few months ago through friends. We're both in our late twenties/early thirties. Noticed he wasn't really on my level (yet) career-wise and saw this as a potential problem  -- I'm pretty driven and I also got lucky, and it HAS caused tension in past relationships --, but he seemed really cool with it, which I loved. It was also going to be a long-distance thing at least temporarily, but we both wanted to give it a shot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo at first he really SHOWERED me with attention and compliments. Super-long skype sessions in the beginning, then called me or message me all the time just to check in and ask me how I was doing. I DID think it was a little much... how often he'd call, sometimes at weird times. And his \"I love you\"s and \"forever\"s came WAY too soon now that I think about. But I really liked him ... and so I liked it. And ignored my gut feeling.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I said, it was a kinda long distance thing. So after 2-3 weeks of extensive talking, we first met up after we initially had met, aka our first real date! This was when things started to get weird. He'd criticize me for the weirdest things (supposedly I talk funny, chew funny, ... stuff like that). And he'd react very poorly, with so much anger, when I pointed out to him that I don't like being criticized again and again for stuff that nobody ever pointed out to me before. He'd also start to try and tell me what I can say and what I can't say to him, what I can wear and what I can't wear. Stuff like that. We got into a pretty big fight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNevertheless, I was hooked. We kept seeing each other. But the weird behavior wouldn't stop. And it wasn't just the citicizing and controlling me. He'd randomly pretend as if he was breaking up with me, just to take it all back minutes later. He'd even randomly call me names or call me fat, just to take it back and pretend as if it was just a joke, \"obvi\", and I was boring for not laughing at it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe had also started to paint various stuff in my life in a negative light. So yes, I chose a demanding career path and work a lot, sometimes very long shifts, including night shifts. But it's my dream job and I worked hard for it. And while, at first, he'd tell me how intrigued and proud he was, he began to ask me questions like: Is it really worth it? Don't you feel drained? Do you think you have enough time for your friends and family? Almost as if he WANTED me to feel bad about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after yet another visit, with yet another fight, he suddenly went low contact. The funny thing is: he didn't even really break up. He just wouldn't call nearly as often and wouldn't say anything nice or meaningful. But he also wouldn't break up. I myself had to confront him again and again a few days after this had started, and initiate the break-up myself. He then criticized me again for a bunch of seemingly random things, told me he felt like it just didn't work out (so true) and that he wasn't sure if he still loves me. Wanted to remain friends. I said no thanks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm still trying to make sense of it, although that's possibly a mistake. Obviously I still think about it and it still bothers me.

I've made tremendous progress since we separated, even with the drawn out divorce. \n   * My ex constantly moves the goal posts as far as communication, parenting time, pick-up/drop-off, etc. I try to use the grey stone/broken record method that is suggested in many emotional abuse survivor books, but he had so long to observe and manipulate me that I get tripped up from time to time. I worry about my kids and how inconsistent their dad is. He does similar things verbally/emotionally to the two older ones that he did and tries to still do to me. \n   * My ex alienated my only daughter from me early on in the divorce. She will only speak with me for a few minutes about once a month and spend a couple hours with me every couple of months. This was after no contact for seven months. [I have regular contact with my three sons, including daily phone calls with my youngest.]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Tell us what you'd like us to do to help. \n   *  I would like to learn what helped others undo years of emotional and other abuse, to take care of myself better and keep reaching for my goals. I gave up so much during our long relationship and for years just tried to survive. I thank God for my best friend reconnecting with me (my ex had alienated me from my family and friends) and telling me some hard truths that started me on the path to reclaim my broken and bruised heart and make a better place for myself and my children.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Rant/Vent:\n   * The biggest one is that he has always claimed to be an upstanding member of his church community, but never really lived it beyond showing up on Sundays. He couldn't wait to start dating after we separated - but this is forbidden by our church doctrine. I guess it shouldn't have surprised me, but it still hurt. He was dating exclusively at seven months, living with her and her kids at fourteen, and married her the day after our divorce was finalized and she was over five months pregnant! They named their daughter the same name he and I had chosen when we were first engaged and didn't get to use. It makes my head spin.\n   * When we agreed to get a divorce I talked to his family to let them know and ask that they not say things to the kids (be decent, not take sides, etc). I later learned that he had been conditioning his family for years with lies and half-truths (people afraid to say things when we were together shared astounding things when we weren't). The real zinger was being told that I carried the spirit of the Devil and therefore drove out the Holy Spirit from their homes whenever I was there with him. I was told how mentally ill and broken I was (I had a diagnosis and was in therapy). His younger sister was glad we were finally divorcing because she had told him for years to leave me. According to them my ex had been a long suffering and devoted husband that could handle the burden of being married to me no longer and he deserved happiness.\n   * My ex had also been emotionally unfaithful during our marriage. At least three women I know about were emotionally involved with him. He may have just used them for ego boosts. He would triangulate his interactions with them to alter my behavior.\n   * A few candid conversations showed me how much he despises people, even his own family. I had hoped and prayed it was just talk or certain personality traits that annoyed him. What I later realized was he is incapable of empathy and uses staged emotions to get what he wants. Its a performance and how does it benefit him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Most Importantly:\n   * I said it so many times after my ex and I first separated, \"I feel like poison was being pulled from me [my body and psyche],\" and that \"I was being detoxed.\" To an extent I was. I was in such a fog the first three or four months.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

A month ago he followed one of my best friends on Instagram (public) and strategically liked all of her posts, except the ones I\u2019m in. She blocked him.

I am a survivor of domestic violence by my husband (we separated in October and are living apart; divorce pending).\n\nMy husband has admitted to being verbally and emotionally abusive after I wrote him a letter explaining what my experience was like living with him over the past four years during which time he became increasingly abusive. I left two times before moving out, which I did while he was away because I feared for my safety. There was rape as well, which he claims he cannot remember because he was drunk. \n\nPhysical threats became evident too - clenched fists, pounding his hands and fists down on the bed or a table...towering over me screaming...chasing me into rooms when I asked to be alone. I lived with so many rules, I even wasn\u2019t allowed to lock the door when I used the bathroom because he needed access to me at all times. He would pretend to slap me then laugh and say it was a joke. I caught him cutting off my dogs breathing once too, pressing her nose closed to discipline her for stealing a sock. \n\nDuring the assault, he put his forearm over my throat too and shoved his fingers into my mouth. I understand the dangerous signs he exhibited. \n\nI feel very stuck. I still love him. I don\u2019t understand it completely and it\u2019s embarrassing given what I\u2019ve endured. Being away from him is physically painful at times. \n\nI\u2019ve read about abuse extensively, I\u2019ve blogged extensively. I have the education to understand this on a rational level. \n\nI also have had therapy and the support of family and friends. But you know what, it\u2019s not helping. \n\nHe said he would work on himself in therapy but insists that I see him in person and put the divorce on hold if I want to save our marriage. \n\nI\u2019m afraid of seeing him because it will make it harder to stay objective.

He would frequently threaten divorce or leaving me if I did something that made him made. He would publicly humiliate me, stomping away when he got mad. And he would make cracks at me for being divorced before despite me repeatedly telling him how much it hurt me. He told me his goal one month was to be nice to me all month. I didn\u2019t know it was that hard to treat another with respect and kindness. \n\nEveryone says don\u2019t go back but this feeling of panic and anxiety over letting go of this relationship go is slowly killing me emotionally. He says I treated him well  - and I did, repeatedly forgiving him for hideous behavior. He says I was a good wife - and I was and know this in my heart. I gave him so much love.

She said they have never been closer and they talk almost every day and he is no longer hanging out with the bad people in his life and although it was terrible, he had his wake up call in life. She heard me out and understood no contact, but then she started saying that I keep having the terrible nightmares because I don't have closure. She was saying I really should reach out to my ex and either write a letter or meet up just to go over what happened and what we're both feeling.

Finally sharing my story!", "author": "NoEntrepreneur7", "self_text": "Obligatory apology for how long/messy this is going to be! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been nearly 2 years since I ended my relationship with my ex and I felt compelled to share my story.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI my ex, who I'll call \"S\", when I was in high school in like 2011 (I was a senior, he was a junior).  I think I gravitated toward him because I'd never met such a kindred spirit before; I grew up in a really tiny rural town and the culture didn't really match up with my progressive beliefs and artsy interests.   After discovering that he was into the same weird music and films I was into and hearing about his open-minded views I became super interested pretty quickly and we were dating soon after we met each other.  If you didn't ever live in a small town it might be hard to imagine how important this part of things was, but until this time I'd never in my life met someone I could relate to like that.  I'd always felt like such an outsider and I felt so happy to finally meet someone I had anything in common with.  This was my first ever relationship.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went to college out of state the following year and S and I stuck together through it, despite me having a really rough time due + not meeting any friends to some personal issues.  We had no problem with the distance despite S not being the best at keeping up communication at times.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe following year S decided he was going to move to the state I was living in and go to a community college there.  This was when things started to really wear me down.  \n\nSomething important to note is that S had a really unstable family.  His parents divorced when he was a baby due to infidelity on his mom's end (she was pregnant with his half sister) and S lived mainly with his mom and stepdad with his older brother and half sister.  His stepdad was an alcoholic/drug addict who was an absolutely terrifying person with severe anger issues.  His mom had bad compulsive lying tendencies and was extremely unreliable.  His dad was a former pastor who was very hard on S for his feminine interests, at one point even physically abusing him as punishment for \"acting gay\".  I could write a book about the unfathomably terrible things this family has done.  \n\nAnyway, when it was time for S to apply for college he was lost and wasn't getting any help from his family so I ended up doing all the legwork for that.  He truly did want to move and go to school but couldn't seem to get any of the steps taken care of.  After waiting around for months, I finally did everything from putting his application in to helping with the FASFA and choosing classes for him.  Things got taken care of.  \n\nWe were planning on moving in about 2 weeks to be there for when S's classes start.  I decide to double check the date because I'm curious and can't remember what S had told me when I see that they actually start the FOLLOWING DAY.  I contact S and we end up packing up our shit all that day and moving the following morning.  S had been telling me for weeks that he had an apartment lined up for himself but he didn't.  He ended up moving in with me.  \n\nWe lived together for 4 years in this same apartment.  It's hard to believe that it lasted that long, honestly and it's a hard period of time to condense.\n\nThroughout these 4 years, S never once paid anything for rent (\"my parents arent rich like yours :(\"), purchased toilet paper/paper towels, or worked for more than 8 hours/week (making $8hr).  I was paying for half the rent with my own money and my parents helped with the rest.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nS ended up going to school for 1 year before taking a \"break\".  I didn't really care whether he went to school or not, whatever he wanted was fine with me.  College is expensive.  I did have a problem with the fact that I was in class 17 hrs a week and working for 24 and that I was the one doing all the cleaning.  Whenever I would gently ask S to consider working more than 8 hours, he'd cry and say something about how I'm like. Trying to support the institution of capitalism or some bullshit.  I once asked him to help me clean and he responded by giving me a 24 hour silent treatment.  This is how any confrontation went; I'd bring up an issue and he'd either cry and make me feel like an asshole or just sulk and ignore me.  S would often talk about applying for an out-of-state art school he wanted to go to but would be very unclear on how serious he was about doing this.  I was ready to move with him if he were to get in, but he refused to tell me details.  For several semesters in a row, S would put an application together then refuse to tell me if he submitted it or not.  He'd act like I was being pushy and unreasonable for wanting to know.  I just wanted to know if I was going to be moving 8 hours away in the next few months or not!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat made this all the more unbearable was the fact that I had no social connections outside of S.  Whenever I was invited to a party/whatever S had to come along unless I wanted to deal with the consequences of his jealousy.  During parties, S would sit by himself in empty rooms instead of socializing with anyone.  S had extreme paranoia about people in general; he was under the impression that everyone looked down on him and had ulterior motives and I don't think I ever saw him having a conversation with someone on his own.  I felt responsible for him at such events and ended up basically hanging out with him so he wouldn't be alone.  I stopped getting invited to anything and S became the only person I ever really interacted with. It was like this for 4 years.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nS had some pretty serious mental issues that I ended up glossing over because of my lack of exposure to other people.  That lack of exposure made it hard to see how bad things were.  S was obsessed with his appearance and there were countless times that we'd be late to things because he wouldn't leave the mirror until he was satisfied enough.  He'd refuse to leave the house for something as minor as a single eyebrow hair not being uniform in color.  Or not having the right shade of white shirt to go with his outfit.  He talked endlessly about his hatred for his appearance despite being a really good looking guy.  I felt bad, but over the years it became harder and harder to stay physically attracted to him when all I hear 24 hours a day is a constant stream of the minute features he has problems with.  \n\nHe was also convinced that my parents were conspiring against him.  He'd often return from a coffeeshop and tell me that he saw my aunt there (who lived down the street from us) and he'd be positive that my mom sent her to \"watch\" him.  He'd have an unpleasant interaction with a rude stranger and it would tear him up for years.  Someone honked at him in a parking garage once and it was so traumatic for him that he refused to ever go back to that store.  \n\nThe way S saw himself was really incongruent with who he actually was.  In reality, he was a painfully shy and withdrawn person who was immensely difficult to get to know.  He was constantly in his own head and convinced that everything that happened in his life had a deeper poetic meaning.  He saw himself as a very sensitive \"empath\" with a big heart and amazing intellect.  In turn, he seemed to see me as something that I wasn't either.  He saw me as the \"evil\" to his good, the robot to his empath.  He would constantly treat me like I was a heartless bitch, which I ended up believing in the end.  Every time I would try to suggest he make a change in his life he'd say something about him being the empathetic and kind one and me being the cold and evil one and how he clearly would know better.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe took ownership over his interests in a way that was really destructive to mine.  I stopped creating art for a few years near the end of our relationship despite being an art major because of the way he talked about art.  I was more of a digital artist who enjoyed drawing monsters and creatures and environments (think video game concept art) while he was more of a gallery artist.  He convinced me that conceptual/contemporary/fine art was the only art worth making and that even if I was more skilled than him in terms of technique, my art was shit because I wasn't making art for a gallery.  He saw my pursuits as commercial and fake and made me feel awful about it. Whenever I'd confront him about it he'd deny it. \n\nI've always been very into music as well, which is one of the main things that brought us together initially.  Over time I lost interest in music.  He saw himself as \"the one with good music taste\" in the relationship and didn't think there was room for me to have an interest in it.  He would be dismissive of what I enjoyed and I lost my enjoyment of music as well.  \n\nThis trend bled into all other areas of my life and I really really lost a sense of my identity.  I felt constantly confused as to who I was.  Before this I thought that I was a loving, generous caretaker interested in art and music and video games.  A few years in and I just felt like a boring accessory in someone else's life with no path or interests of my own.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe relationship ended after 5 years but the part with the breakup is a whole different story.  I'll maybe make a second part to this if I end up wanting to but I'm getting tired of writing for now.  Thanks for listening. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My ex is 28 and I am 19, currently.\n\nIt was my first relationship.I grew up in an abusive household with no parents and moved in 3 hours away with him the day I graduated, simply because I was naive, trusted him, and had nowhere else to stay. It increasingly got worse and worse. My ex had been a bit rough with me before, grabbing twisting and jerking my arms and at one point prying my phone from my hands because he wanted to search through it.\n\nWe did not mesh well together. We constantly argued. I know I made mistakes as well, I was not good at communicating and my mood swings add mental illnesses (I have Autism, PTSD, and GAD) made me hard to handle, and I just needed out of this. I have struggled with my gender for most of my life. My ex told his friends that he would not be with me if I was trans, if I transitioned and \"changed my body\" he would leave me.\n\nOne of my ex's best friends violently raped me several months ago, right before my 19th birthday. My ex barely believed me even though I was bruised pretty terribly, and someone else had to rescue me because my ex boyfriend did not act. Whenever I saw my rapist in public, who followed me to work, I had a panic attack and called him in tears. He told me I was \"just hallucinating and imagining things\" and that I should take a picture if I wanted anyone to believe me.\n\nHe made me feel as if my feelings were not valid, including getting pissed that I wouldn't take off for an anime convention RIGHT AFTER MY GRANDFATHER DIED. We lived in a house together that was gated, and I was not allowed to have a key to either the gate or the house because it was a part of his family's business property. Everytime I tried to beg my ex's friends for help to get out of there, or explain what was going on, they would not believe me because he is so good at manipulation and making it seem like he was a great guy.\n\nI got a skin disease from the hospital my grandfather had been in before his passing, and my ex threatened to throw me out on the streets because he didn't \"want to deal with it.\" I wanted to leave. We had gotten a lease together for a new house, and I told my ex several times that I wanted to break up. I wanted to live as roommates in seperate rooms, because I had nowhere else to go, but I wanted to break up. I told him, \"This isn't working. We should break up.\" and his response was, \"If you break up with me I am breaking the lease, and you won't have a place to go.\" which would screw me over cause I had a college deposit that I had made. He refused to break up with me.\n\nI went to see a close friend I was interested in, and we did romantic things that week, 7 months ago. Am I proud of not having restraint? No I am not. That was wrong of me, but I felt as if I was trapped. I will never act that way again and wait until I am completely out of the situation before acting upon my feelings.\n\nI had no one in this area, I had nowhere to go because my grandmother was struggling to get her finances straight after my grandfather's death. I was kicked out regardless, my stuff thrown out in a walmart parking lot, and had to stay with a coworker who was male. So then my ex told people I cheated on him twice in one week which was not true. I tried dating the guy AFTER i had moved in, and it didn't work out. My ex also got me blacklisted from the apartment rental company by telking them lies about me and saying I was a cheating whore. He told me to kill myself and made me feel like I was less than nothing. If anyone liked me, he would convince me that it was only cause they wanted sex from me and he told me that all of my friends were toxic. He also called me a lying, cheating, manipulating whore.\n\nBut in fact, my ex cheated on me multiple times months prior both with people online and at conventions, which I have also shown below. After this, my ex was living elsewhere, and wanted to get back with me. I had to kick out my roommate because my ex said he would not have anything to do with me unless I did that, then he refused to live here when he had agreed to it so that I could pay rent and not have to work while at school.\n\nI broke up with him AGAIN. A couple months later, he tells me he is about to be homeless, and he needs to stay with me. I agree, but then he starts showing the same behaviors I didn't like and I said look, I don't think this is a good idea. He completely lost his shit, caused drama in a friend group, and insisted he had nowhere else to go. Later, he said he had opportunities to go elsewhere but I manipulated him into living with me.\n\nThe whole time he was here, he did not pay rent. He shoved me down and hit me, because he was sending bad messages about me and people I care about, wouldn't stop, and then hit me cause I laid a hand on his phone to stop him, and that was the end of it. He says I am lying but I could not breathe due to the force of his hand punching me in the chest.\n\nHe has damaged my apartment and stolen all my things, including games, furniture, and appliances. He has leaked my NUDES and admitted to trying to manipulate me into a sex tape so he can \"ruin me\" for future partners. And on top of all this, he wants to say that I am manipulative, toxic, and lying. I made a post on fb trying to purge myself of any mutual friends and explain what happened because he kept shittalking me and blackmailing me into not going to the police by saying he would send my nudes and suicide notes from over a year ago to my grandmother's house.\n\nThis immediately caused backlash. He is immensely popular and used that fact to make a ton of fb posts about me, taking things I said out of context, like saying he showed autism symptoms and needed therapy. I had random strangers attacking me who didn't even know me because I told him that he SHOWED SIGNS of a disorder that I have. I lost so many friends. I am living in a different place now, with new roommates, but my new partner knows me via the ex. Pretty much any friends I had before meeting my partner were through the ex.\n\nCosplaying and going to anime conventions used to be my passion now, but I hate it because I see him there and it feels like he is following me. I have him blocked but nearly every friend I have is associated with him. I have nightmares about him and it makes it hard to focus on college. The ex has harassed my partner and tried to tell him I'm an awful person. He even tried to use screencaps from a conversation that was over 9 months ago when my current partner and I had a disagreement, trying to turn him against me. Of course, we actually communicate with each other and the argument has been resolved for MONTHS, but my ex is still digging dirt.\n\nI feel like I can't trust anyone except my new partner because those mutual friends who don't hate me want to take a neutral stance. I am so hurt and in so much pain, but they still want to hang out with both of us and go to great lengths to try and support him. I know everyone will say, make new friends, but that's nearly impossible for me due to being a shy, autistic little freak. I have no friends at college. I feel like I have no one and the only community I had (Anime) is rife with people who support my abuser.\n\nI am attaching screenshots of things he's said to me, just to give some context for the hell that I had to endure. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm trying to transfer colleges and be in a new environment, but the process is so difficult, and I'm so broken because of this guy. It's so painful.\n\nTLDR: Ex was abusive (Read screenshots) and I don't know how to heal or make friends because everyone I know wants to remain neutral or side with him.\n\nScreenshots: https://imgur.com/a/a4awkwm", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Today my inner voice; or maybe it was god or gods or Gia...whatever you want to believe, Told me one reason why gratitude is a challenge is because people forget to be grateful for themselves. \n\nBeing grateful of self means acknowledging your self worth and for those who don't feel they are worth much its hard to feel gratitude and joy for simple things that are perceived as invaluable. \n\nWhen you are constantly told you're worthless either in actions or words from others, you search for something that would make you become worthy. Materialistic things, careers, hell even sex, and that's where addictions can start and self harm.\n\nSo realizing this healed me a little inside. For the first time I said I was grateful to myself and gave myself  some self worth. It felt good. And I don't mean this in a narcissistic way or anything like that. \n\nI have felt worthless my whole life. I am insignificant and now worth any good. And at the age of 31 almost 32 I have given myself a new segment of healing my mind and soul. \n\nDespite my faults, I am still a good person. I want to help people. I have helped people. I've given homeless people the little bit I can spare. I have donated clothes to a child in need. Despite my faults I have an outrageous amount of Compassion and kindness when my faults/disabilities, and health issues don't interfere. I see how life is, and how it should be.\n\n I try to make the world a better place in my own little ways. I try hard and overcompensate at times even though I may have gotten used, even given people the benefit of the doubt. Despite my social awkwardness I love people and try not judgmental. I fail sometimes but I'm only human.\n\n I am naive and still have a little bit of a child's innocence when it comes to the ways of the world. My heart aches for how cruel this world is and I want to make it better but I feel powerless. Everyone has their own opinions on what will make the world a better place. In my world I wish the selfish people would stop being selfish. \n\nIt's hindering everything in this country. My Ideal community would be one that is similar in the show \"when calls the heart\" where gentlemen are gentlemen but not oppressive towards women, and one that helps each other no matter the situation. I can't remember the exact quote from the bible  but in Christianity God calls us to action, to love thy neighbor as thy self. \n\nThat means sheltering them if they become homeless, feeding them even if its the last piece of bread, or maybe just being kind and giving them a helping hand. Giving the clothes off your back if someone was in need because you have plenty at home. If people are there for each other like that without judgement and without selfish attitude, this world would be a better place. \n\nI am worth something because of this and that's why I need to be grateful for myself.  I am one of the precious jewels that are hidden by the roughness. I just need some cutting, buffing and smoothing out in order to shine the way I need to.\n\nI need to be grateful for my positive qualities and not think the world is ending because some people don't see my true heart. Only then will I start being able to feel gratitude the way I should and thus experience true joy for the first time in my life.\n\n#thoughtsongratefulness", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

{"post_id": "afsbmm", "created_utc": 1547441883, "title": "Is This Abuse? (Long post)", "author": "vibridropp", "self_text": "This is a bit of a long story and I'm feeling extremely conflicted right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, for some background. I'm a 20 year old autistic female, currently struggling with depression and PTSD symptoms. I'm mixed race, white Russian on my mother's side and Black and Cherokee on my father's side. My parents are divorced, and from the time I was 4 I was raised primarily by my mother and stepfather. My stepfather is also white. I wouldn't bring race into this if I didn't think this may have been a factor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStarting from when I was a young child and up until I was about 16 (in my mother's case, it's still ongoing with my stepfather), my parents would make me feel like the scum of the earth. They would scream at me for every infraction, even if I didn't realize what I'd done wrong or if I've *never* done something wrong (I was once screamed at because my mother thought I was wearing black lipstick--I was wearing red lipstick that looked darker in the dim garage). Sometimes they would shun me; my mother once ignored me for a straight week while I was in middle school, and to punish me for lying about grades my stepfather would make it a point to exclude me from family activities because he was so disgusted with me. My mom made comments like \"if you were born with dark skin you'd be ugly,\" she and my stepfather would make fun of my hair, and when I showed any pride in my heritage that wasn't specifically white or Russian, they would belittle me. Until I was a teenager and spent more time around my dad, I felt shame for ever taking pride in my heritage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I grew up, they would also grab or smack my butt, or jab me in the side. Normally it wouldn't be a problem, but I hate being touched in such a way, and I felt violated whenever my butt was groped (they also called my butt \"crabcakes.\") I tried to make it clear that I didn't want to be touched that way, but they never listened. Mom backed off a while ago, but my stepfather continues to touch me without my permission and get upset when I tell him to stop. I have to threaten to bite him to get him to back off, and sometimes even that doesn't work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowing up, I felt like I had no say in anything. I wasn't allowed to watch anything but Fox News and would get yelled at if I watched or read liberal material. My stepfather especially would talk down to me, call Obama \"un-American\" in front of me, and essentially accused me of being stupid when I asked why he supported Trump when he called Mexicans \"drug dealers and rapists.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was a middle schooler, I got into Assassin's Creed--which while admittedly it wasn't appropriate to be playing that game so young, it was a special interest of mine and I was excited to share it with my parents. Their response was to blame my struggles in school on Assassin's Creed, destroy the CD, and ban mention of the game in the household. My stepfather decided it was \"Muslim propaganda\" and it got to the point where he took away and destroyed a shirt my friend decorated for me because it was related to Assassin's Creed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes they would also hit me, but not all the time. Mom would sometimes kick me, smack me, pull my hair, and scream and swear at me. She also threatened to kill me. My stepdad would sometimes stop her from hitting me, but he would spank me viciously. Once he spanked me so hard I urinated on myself, and another time he pinned me so that I couldn't breathe so he could spank me while I was choking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy stepfather would put me down constantly, make me feel worthless compared to his sons (my stepbrothers). I often lied about struggling in school because my parents would get extremely angry with me if I earned a C or lower, and my parents took that as me \"punishing\" them. They did little to help me; they stuck me with a therapist and stuck me in summer school but they never altered their behavior. Mom only stopped beating me when I was 16.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last time she attempted, we had an argument over my depression. She refused to call it that and instead called it \"darkness,\" and tried to blame my special interest in video games on it. She refused to listen to me when I tried to explain to her that I wasn't lazy, I was sick, and I yelled at her in an attempt to get her to back off. She lunged at me, and I grabbed her wrists and pushed her away to put space between us. She dialed 911 and told them I was suicidal (I had yelled that it felt like I was dying, because I was in the middle of a massive panic attack), and I was taken to the hospital in handcuffs where I had to witness the bloody aftermath of an accident, pee in a cup, and be locked in a white room for hours while my mom told the psychiatrist that I was the one that lunged at *her*. She still sticks by that story to this day. I couldn't tell my therapist at the time, because I was terrified of what would happen to me and my little brother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother was open sexually, which for the most part was a good thing (she taught me about safe sex, taught me consent, all that jazz), but sometimes she crossed the line. Sometimes she would stick her finger between my butt cheeks, she would comment on my genitalia (comparing mine to hers), asked to see and made fun of my pubic hair, ask me what I fantasized about when I masturbated, asked about my *partner's* genitalia, and even once told me a story about when the family cat was kneading on her (either on her legs or on her bits, I don't remember), and she got so horny that she had to jack off. Once there was an actor we both liked on Law and Order, and she pantomimed \"riding\" him and moaning in front of me. She also once pinned me to the ground and spat alcohol in my mouth while drunk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy biological father has been in my life from the very beginning, but since he doesn't contact Mom very often, he never knew about what happened between me, Mom, and stepdad outside of lies my mother would feed him. I just emailed him telling my story (it's easier than talking in person--I currently live with him while I attend college), and now I'm wondering if that was a mistake, even though he hasn't seen it yet (it's late at night where I am as I'm writing this.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe reason I'm talking about this is because recently my Mom and stepfather gave me a book called *Can't Hurt Me* by David Goggins. In the opening chapters (which I haven't read past), he discusses growing up in an abusive household where his father would violently and viciously abuse him, his brother, and his mother. The book was gifted to me for Christmas (they often give me self-help books on holidays), and when I read it, I was so overcome with emotion I wanted to tell my parents what it felt like while growing up with them. I didn't expect them to take it well, but they took it worse than I thought.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom fought with me and tried to gaslight me on some of the details, claiming that it was only traumatizing because I'm autistic and the reason why I'm depressed is because I'm \"so sensitive\" I picked up her depression and my biological father's depression and internalized it. She claimed the nickname for my butt was actually inspired by Spongebob and had nothing to do with my body at all, but I knew that wasn't true because they would explicitly use that word to refer to my butt. She tried to downplay the times she went too far sexually, and was more concerned with not being a sexual abuser than acknowledging how what she did hurt me. When I was growing up she would blame the abuse on her trauma from her own childhood, and when I confronted her recently, she told me it \"wasn't fair\" and that she felt like I was cherrypicking my childhood. She acknowledged some of what she did to me, and I had to assure her that she wasn't a monster and that despite what happened, I do sincerely love her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy stepfather was shown the letter without my permission, and he made it a point to ignore my calls and my messages. Tonight he messaged me via email that he didn't want to talk to me, and offered me money for college. When I confronted him on this, he accused me of living in a \"twisted sense of reality.\" He accused me of not understanding circumstances, implied that my father wasn't a real father because I visited him mostly while on holiday, lied about how many times and how roughly he spanked me, lied about his disciplining and how much he put me down, and suggested that I \"ask Ryan\" (my oldest stepbrother) about \"what it was really like,\" when I clearly remember my stepfather once smashing Ryan's television in a fit over school struggles. I asked him to at least apologize and be my father or not contact me at all, and he chose not to contact me at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm wondering if  I hadn't just blown this whole thing out of proportion. I feel like total shit for confronting him and Mom and for sending the letter in the first place. Part of me doesn't care that my stepfather just brushed me off that way, but part of me also just wants him to be a dad like he was supposed to be. I'm also scared that my mother will reject me because time and time again she's chosen her husband over me, and I'm worried about my little brother--they haven't been physically abusive since I moved out, but I worry about his mental health and I'm scared I'll never see him again. (My little brother is turning 13 this March, and he's my half brother.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do. I feel like I overreacted and that maybe my mom and my stepfather were right. My friends assure me that's not the case, my girlfriend assures me that's not the case, and an abuse hotline I contacted me assures me that's not the case. But I still struggle and worry, because what if I'm too biased? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey wouldn't hit me or scream at me every day, and sometimes it felt like our relationship was pretty steady. But the gaslighting and them being emotionally unavailable was constant. I always felt like I was lesser compared to my stepbrothers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly don't know what to do and it's driving me insane.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: Parents hit me, were shit to me emotionally, and sometimes invaded my boundaries, and they freaked out when I confronted them about how it made me feel. Friends, girlfriend, and hotline called it abuse, but I'm not sure of anything.**", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Assessing people's \"worth\" based on status and appearance is of course nothing new, but it's gotten so much worse. \n\nThe world is out of control because these values are wrong. It shouldn't be that just because someone went to a more \"prestigious\" school, that person should be considered \"better\" than another person. Or because someone's title at work is more senior, that means they're \"better\" than everyone below them in rank. Or because someone is more physically attractive, that makes them \"better\". And so, what, these \"better\" people should therefore be allowed to control and dictate what happens to everyone who is \"lesser\" than they are? That doesn't even make sense. \n\nThe measure of a person shouldn't be external things like this. What *should* matter is the core of that person, their intentions and how they treat other people. Because that is what actually matters. Do they have integrity? Are they well-meaning? Do they stand for something noble of purpose? But this world distorts all of that and causes people to compete for things that are considered coveted. And then you end up with people who don't, and can't, connect genuinely with other people because they're too busy fighting those people for assets, trying to move them out of the way so that they can be the winner. They're so busy focused on themselves they they've stopped caring about anything that isn't them.\n\nI personally have stopped respecting people who rest on their \"assets\" like this, who aren't actually good people. Who don't actually have integrity and who don't actually treat others well. I look at the PERSON now, and if you're full of it, you're full of it - I don't care how much money you have, or where you went to school, or what your job title is, or how good-looking you are.

Also, it's a horror film so some of the details are pretty shocking, just a warning. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nSo, in the movie, Chris is love-bombed and gaslit by his girlfriend, for the purpose of luring him to her wealthy parents' home in the suburbs so that he can be auctioned off to an older, wealthy bidder. The highest bidder gets to have their brain surgically removed and transplanted into Chris's head, so that they can have all the advantages of a young, fit body. Chris, in the meantime, is to be hypnotized to the point where he is still somewhat \"in\" his body, but he doesn't have control over it because most of his brain has been removed and the other person's brain will have taken over. They call this hypnotism being in the \"sunken place\". \n\nChris trusts his girlfriend completely because she is so convincing. She says all the right things, does all the right things to make it appear that she really does love him. She stands up for him, fights for him, protects him. He has no reason to believe that something is off about her or her intentions, or her family's intentions for that matter. He's a good person who genuinely believes he's in a solid relationship. He doesn't know he's being lured to his own destruction.\n\nComparing this to narcissistic abuse, you can see so many parallels. You have the unsuspecting victim who is targeted for some quality, trait, or asset that they have, that the narcissistic, predatory person wants. The victim is love-bombed into thinking that they're special, chosen, and loved. The victim trusts the narcissist, lets down their guard and allows the narcissist into their life. Once in, the narcissist then proceeds to trap the victim, using gaslighting to ensure that the victim stops trusting themselves and what they know to be true. The victim is further lured, and at this point the narcissist starts cashing in on their investment by leeching off of the victim and taking all the things the victim has for themselves. They use the victim up, taking everything for themselves, and the victim is ultimately left a shell of their former self. And, if they stay with the narcissist, they can be brainwashed and controlled by that narcissist for the rest of their lives. They are effectively in a \"sunken place\". \n\nThe movie itself is obviously a horror film and has a strong racial element to it, but when I saw it I immediately thought of narcissistic abuse and the process of that.

Lately it's been haunting me.", "author": "ThatsMrMisterToYou", "self_text": "When I was in my early to mid teens I was involved a situation where I would babysit for a group of single moms in my area who would come home after the kids were in bed and have sex with me or get me to do things to them. At first it was only one woman and after working for her maybe ten or twelve times I was coerced with alcohol and a ruse about accidentally locking the door and loosing the keys to delay my departure long enough to get me into bed. She would keep getting distracted in her drunken state and get close and touch me and ask me if I was sure I didn't want a drink. Eventually I complied to her and she paid me extra and I went home. When I got home I felt kind of wierd about the whole thing and couldn't sleep and spent the night reflecting on it. By the morning I'd decided I'd do it again for the extra 100 I got out of it.\n\nLater on she recomended me as a sitter to another woman who did exactly the same. Eventually there was a handful of women. I pretty much realised right away what was going on. I was about 13 when this all started and it went on until I was about 17. Then they just stopped asking me to sit for them one by one, the woman who started it being the last. After that I really realised exactly what had been going on and I was so very conflicted by this for several reasons. One in that I realised they were only interested in me for what I was. A young teenage boy. And two in that I felt completely rejected and almost like there was something wrong with me that they had no interest in me any more. It was all pretty clear to me what had gone on and why they had done what they had done but my feelings didn't line up with that understanding. \n\nThey would tell me all sorts of things to make me feel good about it and about myself and I mostly dismissed it at the time but I guess that if you get told the same things over and over you start to belive it a bit. When they stopped it made me feel like I'd been lied to and I guess I always knew that but it didn't stop me feeling a bit betrayed by it all.\n\nThe whole thing really messed with me and gave me a completely screwed up idea of what my role was in intimacy with women. Even today it effects my sex life and my trust altogether with women. About a year later I ended up sitting for another woman (who I met through a friend) in exchange for a couch to sleep on when I was in the city. And the second time I sat for her she told me the couch was too small for me to sleep on comfortably (which it was) and that I could take the other side of her kingsize bed. I said sure because I had figgured it would be better than a night on a two seater couch with my legs dangling over the side. Before too long she had her butt pressed up against me and was slowly grinding her hips against me and eventually she reached over and grabbed my hand an pulled me over to put my hand around her and placed it on her breast. And it was like I was on autopilot from that point on. I wasn't even attracted to her to be honest but I felt like it was something I had to do for some reason. I was asked to sit for her a few times after and I did but after a while I started to make excuses because it was starting to really upset me. \n\nI ended up thinking my role in the bedroom was simply to please and that it was just how the world and sex in general worked. Especially with media going on about how men need to be able to please women in the bedroom and ridiculing men for not being able to do so effectively. That combined with being laughed at and even attacked for \"acting like it was anything like what I went through was anything like what women have to go through.\", on the two occaisions I did try and confide in someone.\n\nIt wasn't until I was about 22 before I met someone who I \"shared\" a mutual sexual experience with where it wasn't just about pleasing her. \n\nEven today I still have problems performing if I don't do certain things for my female partner to please her. And I've never been able to really trust anything positive said about me or any sort of compliment especially with how I look or to do with intimacy and I always immediately suspect they are trying to get something out of me or have an alterior motive.\n\nLately it's been coming up in my forethoughts and remembering how I felt when they stopped asking me to sit and how they had made me feel before that and I well up and choke up completely. And at the worst times too like when I'm out shopping in public or at a friends house. Last week I just spent the day in bed because it was the first thing in my mind when I woke up and it just ended my day I felt hopelessly miserable. I feel like I'm mourning the loss of something important to me but in reality it's a trainwreck of thoughts and emotions and nothing to mourn. And I think about how I never really got treated like I was anyway special or given compliments like I did back then and even when someone has tried it's been marred by my suspicion and I could never appreciate it. As I've gotten older it's gotten less and less and women increasingly seem to go out of their way to be nonchelant about me like they've been with better and try and make me feel mediocre at best and it physically hurts and make me feel sick and depressed. I know it's validation seeking on my part but I don't know how to handle it.\n\nI dunno what I'm really trying to do by saying all this. I guess I just want to let it out and tell someone. Not even sure if that's the right thing to do right now but I feel like it's staring to inflate and fill me up. I'min my mid thirties now and I've been celibate now for about 4 years for various reasons one of which and the biggest cntributing factor being my inability to trust. I could find someone and even have offers pending so to speak but I just don't want to be sexually involved with anyone and I'm afraid of emotional bonds. It's also very lonely like this and I don't want to be alone. I just don't really know how not to be right now.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

In other words, I had sex only out of obligation and fear.\n\nIt didn\u2019t occur to me until a few months ago that having sex only for fear of the repercussions of saying no is indeed sexual assault. \n\nI am now in a healthy relationship but cannot shake those old thought and behavioural patterns. I suddenly came to the realization a few months ago that I often agree to doing things even if I don\u2019t necessarily want to because I\u2019m afraid my partner will get mad if I say no. I know it\u2019s an old learned behaviour because my current partner would never force me to do anything I don\u2019t want to, especially anything sexual. Still, I became so worried that I was doing the same thing with him that I did with my ex that we haven\u2019t had sex in months and now I have a huge mental block about it. \n\nI\u2019m worried about what will happen to our relationship if we don\u2019t have sex again soon (these are my worries only - he is a genuinely decent man and hasn\u2019t pressured me even slightly), but then I worry that if we have sex only because I\u2019m worried, I\u2019m doing the same thing all over again. \n\nHow do I stop overthinking this? Will sex ever feel like anything other than an obligation to me? Will I ever just be in the mood ever again? Help. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I held in hatred for school and loneliness and broke when my parents said stuff that stressed me. I didnt show up to finals or care about any thing. Did weed a bunch and just eanted to give up. Trying to explain to my parents i broke. I seem apathetic until i cry. When we socialize im the odd one out. I used to think it was okay for people to treat me like shit and that im not allowed to be offended because ill look stupid like people expressing emotions do. I just hate looking stupid and weak in front of people. And if i laugh or show any kind of emotion i get anxious im not fitting the persona the people watching expect.

I also like it rougher than he feels comfortable. \n\nI confessed these and other things to my partner and he shamed me. Since then I don't feel like I even want him to touch me. I feel like I can't be myself and comfortable in a sexual way with him anymore. I need control and he struggles with that. I just need to not feel like I'm a victim? Sometimes him even initiating sex makes me clam up and feel forced upon. I absolutely can't go down on him unless we're having 2 way sex, he sometimes asks me to while I'm out of action and it makes me so angry which I know isn't right. \n\nI don't know what it is that makes me not want to go down on him, I think it's linked with what happened when I was 3 because I've always had issues with being asked to do that, and I sometimes get this memory of a taste that completely makes me feel sick, I only know what that taste is after my relationship I'm in now, I don't remember much about my molestations. I also hate him going down on me, it makes me uncomfortable and I don't enjoy it even a little bit.\n\nI feel like I'm pushing him away now, he's a great person and I love him so much.. but he feels like I don't want him or he's not good enough in some way...

I just feel like, if these evil people didn't decide to mess with me I'd be normal, having normal sex and feeling happy about it instead of wanting that element of \"more\" all the time. \n\nAm I alone?

Sorry if this comes across as rambling.\n\nI am a 22 year old woman, I have two younger brothers and a half sister who is four years older than me. When I was a child, my sister was the coolest and most fun person to be around and I completely adored her. As she is my half sister she only spent weekends with us which made all of her visits seem quite special. My family had a caravan at the seaside which we would visit quite often and on one of these visits something happened between my sister and I. I couldn't tell you how it happened, but one night when i was around four and my sister was around eight, my sister began to play with my private area and I remember enjoying it (probably because I didn't know any different) and this escalated to her performing oral sex on me and me performing oral sex on her. I remember not enjoying having to do it to her. Our parents caught us doing that and I felt shame crash over me and as my sister has never been good with confrontation I lied for us, saying that we were just looking at each others \"parts\". \n\nTo cut a long story short, this sexual activity became our little secret and it carried on for five years. Whenever she came to visit, we would do all of this sexual stuff and it made me feel important, grown up. I remember not really understanding why, but i knew it was wrong and it made me feel so gross and disgusting. However, I wanted to do it for her because she was my older sister. I don't really remember when it came to a stop, but I remember being devastated when someone told me when I was around eight that if you had kissed someone you wasn't a virgin anymore and that affected the way I felt about it.\n\nWe stayed very close until I got to around 16, when the shame and guilt of the whole thing set in. We haven't spoke about it ever and I haven't spoken to her properly or seen her in around 5 years. She now has a one year old baby and thoughts of what she might do to him torments me. The only people who I have ever told are my ex boyfriend and my current boyfriend, who has been overwhelmingly supportive and wonderful about the whole thing. It's his idea that I post on here just to vent and seek support. \n\nSo my question is; was this sexual abuse? Is this a big enough deal to tell my parents? I've harboured this for so long. Thanks in advance. \n\nTLDR; I feel as if I was sexually abused by my older sister, but I don't know if it constitutes as abuse. Should I tell my parents?", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Her fiancee is very abusive. He insults her and her family with very deep personal remarks, he chokes her and hits her. I have seen her covered in bruises from one of these attacks. He will smash and destroy property during these outbursts. He is very controlling and often will do things to ensure she cannot leave the house and is isolated from friends and family.

He blames all of these things on her and she always eventually accepts that as true and forgives him.\n\nHim, his mother, and her all agree that the root cause of all of this behaviour is his autism and that anyone who refuses to accept that he has no control over it is ignorant and unsupportive. \n\nOne example of this is, the family cat died and he texted messages insulting the cat and all of us and saying we deserve our cat's death.

This is the story about my stepmother. This is the story about how she was supposed to be my mother figure, but she wasn't. \n\nMy mom and dad separated when I was 4. They ended up getting a divorce, my dad gained custody, and he married my stepmother six months after it was finalized in 2005; I was seven at the time. \n\nI was upset at first because at the time, I remembered glimpses of my parents being together, but I now have repressed memories due to the trauma I was dealt with them divorcing when I was so young. I felt like my stepmother was an I intruder in my own home and she distanced me and my sister from our father a little so we spent a lot of time with our grandmother who lived across the street. \n\nMy stepmother had been married beforehand and from that marriage, she has a daughter who is about 10 years older than me, and a son who is 2 years younger than me. Her former marriage was abusive as she mentions sometimes, but I don't know to what extent or if this has anything to do with the way she treated my father, sister, and I. \n\nShe started off attacking my dad by calling him stupid, threatening to divorce him, saying she was going to get the house and we'd be on the streets and during a particularly nasty fight, she threw the three of us out of the house for four days and we stayed with my grandmother. I said something about it to a teacher at school and I was called to the guidance counselor's office and my dad was called. That was the first time I heard the phrase, \"What happens in the house, stays in the house.\" I was in the fifth grade. \n\nShe'd attack me sometimes and call me names, telling me that I needed to listen when she came up with ridiculous demands, and multiple times, she had my dad take my bedroom door off and tore my room apart because she was looking for something that didn't belong to her. \n\nShe's eight years older than my dad, but she tried to dress like a teenager. She and my dad worked for the same factory, which is where he met her and my mother years earlier, and she quit her job when I was in the sixth grade. She applied for McDonald's and worked there for three days before being fired because she claimed she couldn't see the buttons on the register, but I knew a guy who was the son of a manager there and apparently she threw a fit, cussed the manager out, and walked out. \n\nSince then, she's spent a majority of my dad's paycheck on clothes and whatnot, which she ends up failing to sell at yard sales due to her large prices. What she doesn't sell, she donated, and he loses hundreds a year. They share a checking account, but she doesn't have a debit card or a checkbook due to her lavish spending though she's been asking for years. She has her hands on the credit cards instead. It was rough living on a single income with five people in the house. \n\nShe also had the visit the doctor every couple of weeks because she was \"in pain\" and while she does suffer from severe kidney stones, most of her other pains I feel are made up because she appears to be addicted to painkilers and when my siblings had their wisdom teeth removed, she stole the drugs that the doctor gave them while claiming she didn't want them taking them because they were \"addictive\". \n\nWhen I was nearing the end of middle school, I got tired of her putting down my dad and I retaliate telling her to stop and to shut up. She come back by attacking me or having my father punish me. He told me he could stand up for himself, but he never did anything. Around that time, he asked me to record their fights, as he was considering divorce, but it didn't happen. \n\nIn high school, she started attacking me with her slurs and insults and it took a toll on my self worth. I started blaming myself for her being mad at me which I now know it's not because she just miserable. When I graduated, I didn't have a license because she wouldn't let me drive, and she put me down for it because I had never had a job either. I am also bipolar and she claimed my drugs cost too much, and I was taking too many, but when one of her family members went of their antidepressants, she rant and raved that, that person needed to \"take their medication\". Luckily, she never denied me having mine. \n\nMy first year of college was the worst. My dad works 30 mins away from our home, so for school, we go to my stepgrandpa's to get on the bus. While my siblings were entering their sophomore year, she stayed home more often instead of going up there like she did daily when I was still in high school. \n\nI slept in one day and missed my classes. My stepmother was on the phone with someone and called me worthless and said that I'd never amount to anything. I cried while I was in the shower that day because I was defeated. \n\nIt all came to a head that April of 2017. Her and I got into a nasty fight and I packed up a box of things and moved into my ex's (the one in the post above) house with him and his mom. My dad thought I was staying a weekend, but when I didn't return home, I told him that I had, had enough. \n\nAt this point, she had taken the family car that my dad had gifted to me when I got my license and drove it to empty on a day I had to work when I just filled it up; I was almost late. She had threatened to call my job and have me fired, faking that she had, had a horrible experience with me there. She made me buy my own food and then ate it after I had spent a quarter of my paycheck on it. \n\nI was tired at this point. My ex and I broke up, I was forced to move back home, and by this point I had met my current boyfriend and was staying many nights at his and his dad's house. By mid-June, I had unofficially moved in. I brought a majority of my clothes and necessities over there and by August, I changed my address and updated my license. \n\nMy boyfriend went to rehab in July and I called my dad's house and told my stepmother what was going on. She seemed accepting of it, but my sister said that she made a few nasty comments about my boyfriend. I was forced to brush them off. This was before I officially moved in. \n\nI haven't came around much since then. I moved further away this past June. I went up there to update my financial aid information for school and it took 30 mins to find the tax return because my stepmother had hid it and said that she forgot she used it for something, she hadn't. \n\nShe's been attacking my sister, but she has a thicker skin than I do. I almost blew up because in December of 2017, my sister was in a serious car accident where she's lucky to be alive. My stepmother blew up about money when my sister returned home from the accident and my sister went off on her. My stepmother demanded an apology, and my sister had to give her one. I never saw so much red in my life due to her reaction. \n\nMy dad is upset that I don't come around much, but he knows why. He knows I can't be around my stepmother after what she's done to me and he looks so broken nowadays. He works 12 hr shifts almost 6 days a week to support his family, but also dealing with her makes him look years older than he actually is. \n\nI think he's planning on getting a divorce, but once when I was a child, not long after he got married to her, he looked at me and said, \"Do you want me to be alone forever?\" That's always taken a toll on my mind. He knows my sister and I have been making bets on how long it'll take before he divorces her after my sister moves out because she's distanced herself as well. \n\nHe knows he losing his kids because of his wife and I know it breaks his heart. My sister tells me that after her graduation this year, he's going back to college (he dropped out years ago for his current job) to get a certificate in his current field of work so he can make more money. He also may be moving away. \n\nMy stepmother talks about me behind my back and my father has told her that she needs to be nicer to his kids because of how it's taken a toll on him. She doesn't listen. When my boyfriend and I went up to their house for Christmas, he distracted her a majority of the time so I could spend time with my father which is something I don't get anymore. \n\nIt's rough, I miss my dad, but I can't be around her after all she's done.

Still, I have trouble telling this story because falling for his BS makes me feel like a complete idiot so I thought I'd share the story here. I don't often post threads on Reddit so please forgive me for any gross formatting errors. Let me know about them and I will fix them ASAP. I also apologize for this incredibly long story. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe and I met online through a mutual friend I went to school with. Being a narcissist, he was, of course, charming, so we hit it off and basically maintained a non-committed online relationship for several years. There were periods where he would become dramatic and feed me some BS along the lines of \"Not being able to be with you in person hurts so much, I can't do this anymore\" then go NC with me. Weeks or months later the love bombing and hoovering attempt would start up and, being young and naive at the time, I would fall for it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn typical narc fashion, he always painted himself as the victim. Fired? It's his aunt's fault for not taking him to work. Dropping me like a ton of bricks every few months? It's his BPD and can't I just be \"more understanding\"? Kicked out of his friend's house? Obviously it's because their SO just got jealous. And I always believed him. So, when he came to me and said he got kicked out of his parents' (because his Stepfather \"didn't like\" him) and was being forced to live with his religiously conservative and \"abusive\" grandparents, I offered him a place to stay. Rent-free, no less, until he found a job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, before we continue, I have to mention an important detail in all of this: I was/am in an open/poly relationship with my then/current SO, and SO was okay with him staying with us in our extra bedroom.  My Nex was also aware of this and was \"understanding\". However, I'm sure you can all pretty much figure out how well this all went down. I asked a narcissist to share their supply and it obviously went very poorly, otherwise, I wouldn't be here writing about this mess today. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings remained peaceful for a few months. He moved in and he kept to himself for the most part. SO had recently finished his Bachelor's and commuted to a job 45min away where he worked second shift. I had a more irregular schedule as I was still finishing my Bachelor's and working part time. So I'd, of course, prioritize SO when we both had time off, but my Nex and I still had plenty of time together during the day and things seemed to be working out. We spent a few nights out in the living area getting baked, listening to music, watching dumb shows, etc.... It was pretty great. That is, until one morning when I had a day off and SO had already left for work. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm not going to go into a whole lot of detail because this is the worst/most traumatic part of the entire story and I guess I'm not completely over it because I'm starting to shake and even feel nauseous thinking about how to write this. If rape/sexual abuse is a trigger for you, I recommend skipping this paragraph in its entirety. I was sleeping in and felt him crawl into the bed next to me. Up to this point we had really only cuddled and kissed a few times. I generally like to take things slow so this was fine for me and I thought things were fine with him as he hadn't communicated anything otherwise. I was a little surprised, playfully asked him what he was doing, and he kissed me. Additionally, I wasn't comfortable with physical contact beyond this with a secondary partner under the same roof, and had made it clear that I wanted to be respectful towards SO and would be uncomfortable until my Nex managed to save up for a place of his own. So, when he just kissed me lightly I thought \"This is fine,\" and went to pull away. In response, he pulled me in tighter and aggressively started making out with me despite my protests. He continued to get more aggressive, begged and pleaded to go further, despite my \"no's\", and then did what he wanted anyways. He then proceeded to gaslight me about this whole event until even I believed it was consensual and pretty much used it to blackmail me into further sexual acts. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe black mailing went on for a couple of months. My depression got worse and I felt worthless. And my Nex's negging didn't help. He would make fun of me for little things (like how I walked???) and once literally laughed in my face when I discussed my plans for graduate school (despite my high GPA and decent CV).  I started to self-harm again for the first time since high school. Then, one day, out of the blue, my Nex snapped. Apparently, despite slacking off with work, SO, and school, I was still not providing him with enough (100%) of my attention. He barged into SO and I's room and made a scene of accusing me of lying about my relationships. He used everything he had blackmailed me into doing as his proof. SO was, reasonably, pissed-off. My Nex took this opportunity to \"side\" with my SO and also blame me for \"toying with \\[them\\] both\" and they both left me, alone, to walk and \"cool off\". Which, I later found out, was just an opportunity for my Nex to talk shit about me in an attempt to get SO to leave me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter things had settled down (or so I thought), SO and I agreed to set a hard deadline for him to find a place.  We sat down and talked it out with him before I had to leave for class and he agreed. I left for class thinking things were settled but came home to a newly enraged SO who had apparently been told while I was gone that I had 1.) Never told my Nex I was in a relationship until after he moved in 2.) Gotten pregnant and had an abortion during this time and 3.) Had banged one of our mutual friends that came over ONCE during the time Nex had been living at our place. After a little calming down and reasoning, SO realized that these accusations were pretty much baseless. This was the final straw and we kicked my Nex out later that day. We were even nice enough to pack his crap and drop it off, along with him, at his friend's place. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis triggered yet another month of hoovering attempts on Nex's part. There were a lot of \"suicide\" threats, which I took seriously the first couple of times. He also made a big deal about releasing his pet rat (of all things) because he \"didn't know who would take care of him\" (like, for real? It has a 0% chance of surviving in the wild). After the third or fourth \"suicide\" attempt (which was literally just him walking around on a 2nd floor balcony railing), I cut off all contact. He showed up once and sent threatening messages for WEEKS until I got a restraining order and, despite temptation, I've been NC since. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis story does have a happy ending, however. I finished undergrad and got into a grad program (take that, Nex)! Also, SO and I are still together. We're both still open to the poly lifestyle but we learned an incredibly valuable lesson and these days we are definitely much more selective about choosing new partners.  I am so grateful, to this day, that SO decided to believe me about the abuse. He's my rock and we're saving up to get hitched in the next year or so (fingers crossed).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My partner and I are poly. We tried to be nice to one of my secondary partners who turned out to be a narc. It went about as poorly as you'd expect. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

As if it is obligatory for me to help him.

For the majority, it was great. But towards the end, it started getting bad. I would forget things sometimes (small things, like maybe a sweatshirt she left over)...and she would flip. She would comment on my looks (ok, I don't dress like a male fashion model, but i really dont care. I like my flannels and jeans and thats that.) I once got a hat that I love (flannel pattern on it with a deer skull)...not everyone's style, but its mine.

So I gave up. She told me how I caused this, how I pushed her away. How she tried to bring me back. And, through all her screaming and putting me down, its starting to feel like shes right. She also just told me how her friends would talk shit about me, so it makes me feel like others see that too. I used to have some level of confidence, but now that is gone.\n\nHow do you move on from this?

It took me a few hours to decide to even write this, but I have nowhere else to go and I'm running out of options and time. \n\nI'm a 23 year old guy and I've been keeping my sexual abuse a secret for the past ~16 years. When I was 6 I was continuously abused for around a year and a few months by people I should have been able to trust. It has completely devastated my life and broken me. By 12 I was severely depressed, at 15 I began thinking of suicide which disturbed me a bit but by 18 I was thinking of it daily. I cannot function and I've completely given up.\n\nAbout 2 years ago I actually sought help for the first time by seeing the psychiatrist in my university and I only mentioned my depression, he started me on prozac and they did the opposite of help. I quickly developed insomnia, a high blood pressure (which blew blood vessels in my eye making it very difficult to keep this all private), muscle spasms and worst of all, increased my suicidal thoughts. This eventually led to me attempting suicide, which failed as I was found. I was taken to hospital and my family was notified, they didn't know about any of this so it came as a big shock, and they still don't even know the full story because I'm absolutely terrified to tell anybody.\n\nAfter I was discharged I was put on several different drugs and again, none of them provided any relief. But over the past year and a half I have developed what I call these \"dark waves\" that wash over me at seemingly random times as I can't identify anything that causes them. When they wash over me its like I just lose control of my mind, all I can think about is the most macabre, dark and morbid things and phrases like \"Im going to kill myself\" \"I want to die\" \"Kill yourself now\" and the like will play on and on in my head. These episodes last anywhere from an hour to 6-7 and I can't handle it anymore.\n\nI've tried combatting them by trying to block them out with anything, music, video games, movies, SOMETHING I can get lost in usually but theyre not working or at least not working as well as they used to anymore. I've been talking to Samaritans these past couple of months and it was with them that I first revealed my past to anybody and I still find it unbearable talking about it, I feel physically ill typing this.\n\nI've come to the conclusion that I can no longer survive in this world in the state I am in: I can't talk to anybody, I don't want a relationship of any kind because I abhor being touched, I can't stand it. I'm a pathetic excuse for a man, I feel like I never even grew up, as if im still a little kid in my head. I can't trust anybody. I only feel comfortable putting this up here because of the anonymity, I live in a relatively small place and for that reason I don't want to tell anybody. Because of all this I plan to kill myself in a few months time, and I am steadfast in my decision so please just leave that as is, it's a mercy at this stage. I have a place in mind and I will have time to be alone then when I can do it and I won't be found.\n\nThe main reason I'm putting this out there is because I'm DESPERATE for some way to combat these dark waves, they're eating me alive and it's unbearable. I'm constantly on edge scared out of my mind thinking about when the next one will hit me. Does anyone have ANY recommendation at all on how to fight this?\nI don't drink or do drugs, but I am honestly thinking about. I just want some fucking peace man I can't handle this shit anymore.\n\nThanks for reading, any and all help is deeply appreciated, you have no idea. ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Instead of spending time with our children on the weekend, he dropped off our children at his best friends house for a sleepover, I had no knowledge of and certainly would never agree to. 1. Because his best friend is a maniac and literally worries me. 2. Hi best friends family is always dropping by unannounced at his house and they\u2019re all drug addicts and alcoholics and last but not least 3. I don\u2019t feel comfortable with my kids being around strangers and the kids wanted to go home with daddy, not stay at his best friends house. I did it to myself and I looked at her IG page. Then It gets me thinking. I will never understand why I wasn\u2019t good enough. Why after so many years did he decide, I\u2019m done. Two kids, eight years, never wanted to do great things with us or me. Why am I stuck in this cycle of wondering \u201cdid this seriously happen?\u201d And \u201cam I crazy, what world was I living in, I never thought I\u2019d be where I am today\u201d just shocked, I see how happy she must make him. It\u2019s been six months and he already wants to marry her and told me he knew after three weeks that she was the one for him. He\u2019s fine with a stranger raising our children and going through a custody battle regardless of the damage and after effects that kids will have to deal with. He does not care. She\u2019s never had kids, she doesn\u2019t have baggage or a ruined body, no responsibility\u2019s, shes witty because she went to college and often visits trivia nights at the bar, she\u2019s got a ton of tattoos like him, even cooler with a nose piercing, how edgy. She\u2019s got a ton of friends which could only mean she\u2019s not weird and awkwardly shy like me, she has a job, she has the best weed and most importantly time and money. She\u2019s everything I\u2019m not. she\u2019s pretty and I know he chose her because clearly she reminds him of the version of me when he met me in 2008, considering how much we looks alike and if we stood next to each other we could pass as fraternal twins and I\u2019m not even joking. I call her the ugly version of me. I\u2019m not stupid to think that but it definitely leaves me in awe. Like \u201cdid that really just happen, am I in an alternate universe?\u201d. I put up with a lot of abusive and cruel behavior because of his drug use. The fights, they would get bad and here is this woman, she\u2019s never questioned him or had a problem with drugs. She didn\u2019t nag him about getting the laundry done because the kids didn\u2019t have clean clothes to wear, she didn\u2019t clean up after him and the kids. She never berated him with questions about \u201cwhy won\u2019t you have sex with me\u201d or \u201ccan you please wake up so we can talk about our problems please\u201d. She didn\u2019t ask \u201cwhos this person and why do you want a 20 from him?\u201d Or \u201chow are you broke?\u201d She\u2019s perfect for him. How can you pretend that none of it happened? Like did he ever feel anything or even see all the bullshit. It just fucks with my head and even after two years apart, I can\u2019t wrap my head around it. Sorry, I just needed to get this out.

I went no contact with most of those friends and low contact with my family and started looking for a good therapist. I read everywhere that I needed to establish and maintain boundaries and seek out healthy like minded non-narcissistic people so I set off on that path.\n\nI feel a bit confused and low because one of the new friends I made is now showing problematic behaviour and it feels like I might have attracted yet another disordered person/possibly Cluster B person. I met her in an online support forum (not Reddit) when I shared my story about familial abuse and she sent me a message saying she understood and had come from an abusive home. I guess I saw her as a sort of validating mentor friend because she seemed able to understand a lot of the stuff that other people don't, for example she never said things like 'I'm sure she doesn't mean it' about my mother which people who don't understand narcissism tend to say. We have had some phone calls and have been in touch each week by text and initially it felt like a really healthy, helpful friendship that gave me hope.\n\nHowever over time I have noticed red flag behaviour creep in that I am really questioning. Examples include:\n\n1. When I told her I'd been to a certain hobby group but had found a couple of the women there a bit bitchy, she said that all people who like this hobby are always bitchy and unpleasant. I found this strange since I really enjoy this hobby myself, and I certainly don't think you can label everyone who likes any hobby as being a certain way with a blanket statement.\n2. I have CPTSD so sometimes struggle to keep on top of my housework which I thought she would understand. But when I told her I had spent 2 hours washing up (trying to get on top of the washing up from the day before) she said \"How on earth are you managing to create that much washing up alone! I thought of you today when I spent 10 minutes washing up for my whole family. I'm afraid I can only use the time and energy available to me.\" This felt like a really unpleasant thing for her to say, kind of dismissive, boastful, shaming and patronising? It also seemed like she was somehow envious of me spending so much time on housework and had misinterpreted what I said somehow as a slight on her own housework habits.\n3. She has children and I don't (and I am 99% sure I don't want to have children). Her children have behavioural difficulties and one has a disability and now in every text she tells me about how stressed she is about their behaviour. I know it must be very stressful to deal with this and I have tried to help as best as I can but as I don't have children myself I don't know what else to say. She also seems jealous of my free time because I have chosen not to have children, forgetting that she chose to have them herself. If I mention that I enjoyed a peaceful evening or something like that she snaps back that she would love peace and quiet but doesn't have that luxury. I always feel silenced by comments like this.\n4. She has revealed that she self harms. I really feel for her but I find this really hard to deal with and it tends to be a trigger for my own mental health. I feel really stressed and panicky about it because I don't know how to help. Then she texts later on saying she is now fine.\n5. I feel kind of duped into the friendship. I think when she messaged me what she really wanted was support for herself  but pretended to be offering support and mentoring to me since she is 15 years older than me and escaped her abusive relationship years ago.\n\nI am at peace with ending this friendship because writing this out I can see that it is has become quite toxic. I just feel disappointed like I got duped again? I am wondering how I can start making healthier friendships where people don't use passive aggressive communication styles, snap at me, dismiss me, act jealous of every little thing etc. I do have one old genuinely good kind friend who gives me hope that it is possible. I just wish I could make more friends like her, the kinds of friends you feel better after talking to rather than worse.\n\nHas anyone else repeatedly had difficulty forming healthy friendships with healthy people after narcissistic abuse? I think my childhood dynamic seems to be replaying in all my friendships as well as my past romantic relationships.\n\nThank you for listening.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Not literally. I mean my family jokes about me being blonde sometimes but then again we all can be at times. But no one has ever referred to me as stupid. \nI never thought I was... But I guess I was wrong... \n\nGod I could see exactly what he was doing from the very beginning when he started saying all this dumb shit as \"jokes\". I knew he was trying to kill my confidence but I didn't know why and for some reason I didn't know it was for  sinister reasons. Lol maybe I was a idiot. \n\nIt's so (sinister is really the only word that really fits here so yes I'll use it again lol) sinister, how they slowly and methodically try to break you down. And now years later when I'm around him I do feel dumb. I do feel like a idiot. I always do everything wrong when it comes to him and that's not even a lie. I can't ever get his order right when I go to a fast food place. Somehow it's always wrong, I always forget something. I never remember everything he said. When I get it home it's cold. Blah blah blah. If he tells me to put his clothes in the dryer I'll forget. Oh and of course I'm just the worst driver there ever was and he is NASCAR level shit...ok guys, don't fuck with him!!! Just whatever I do is wrong...at least once a day. I even got bitched at yesterday because he actually saved money putting gas in the car??? Don't know how or why that's a bad thing but it was. \n\nI'm stupid, my family is stupid. He just can't comprehend how we've gotten through life with no brains. And now years later I think I purposely forget to do shit for him or do shit that I know will make him mad as some kind of self preservation or something. I know he will never be happy with anything I do for him so why even try to get it right in the first place. When he yells at me like I'm a little kid I just tune it all out and boy is he really happy when I keep doing the dumb things we \"discussed\"(of which I have no clue about because I literally do not hear him when he starts lecturing and yelling). I feel like I'm a horrible narc victim because I've always been stubborn and headstrong and I can't prop up his fucking ego. I just can't do it. But in other ways I was the perfect victim because I was financially ok. I had a job and a car and had great credit. Lol oh ya once upon a time I had those things. \n\nIn the beginning I didn't mind giving him money. I bought him so much shit for his birthday. It was his 21st so I had to go all out. I didn't mind working while he stayed home with the kids (well for the most part, it did kinda irk me since we could have found a babysitter and both worked which would have been way more beneficial for us financially). I didn't even realize that my life was quickly getting hijacked. Suddenly it was his car. His house. His kids(stepkids, they're dad died a few months before I met him). Promises if I get this loan and this loan and this loan he will help me pay it back. Hahaha why the fuck would I ever believe that??? Really I wanna punch myself in the face!!! Ruined my credit that as such a young adult I had worked hard to aquire. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on my job. He eventually got banned from the place for always coming up there and causing scenes if a man was even close to me. Yes he did this!!! One of the first BIG RED FLAGS I missed was we had a party at our new house. Wed only been with each other like 3 months. I was outside with my best friend and his little brother and his brothers best friend. Not doing anything but all of us were standing in a circle... And my bf comes outside, sees his brother's friend standing by me and goes on a rampage, punches the window out of the front door, goes inside and wails and yells and starts crying about me cheating on him or some bs. I was mortified!!! I had never seen anyone react like that to a completely normal situation before. It was very bizarre. And of course my first compulsive reaction was anger at him for completely reacting like that to a little kid, pretty much (his brothers friend was 16) and for breaking out the window at our new house. Over what??? Me standing by a guy??? We weren't even close to each other. I mean we were in our own personal spaces. \n\nOhhhhhh speaking of personal spaces is that something all narcs have a problem with??? Because he has always invaded my personal space. Doesn't understand it. I don't even know how to explain it. Like I don't mind if you wanna invade my space if it's with love but if we're arguing and you're getting up in my face and all around my body and grabbing me hard enough to leave marks all over my arms that is not ok!!!!!!! I knew this guys. I knew this behavior wasn't right. The word ABUSE was flashing inside my mind every time it happened. And I let him know this and eventually he did stop.  So to me he was kinda this young guy who had only had one serious relationship before me. I just thought he didn't know how to act in relationships... All of his horrible behavior I pardoned somehow... \n\nOmg even sex!!! For like the first year he would keep me up every night to have sex. I really didn't mind too much because our sex was amazing. But there were times I was just so tired and I'd have to be at work in a couple hours. Id tell him I really need to sleep but somehow he'd find a way to worm his way into having sex. He was like a magician... Like he would seriously get my clothes off and id be like how did this even happen??? Wed just be playing around and pretty soon all my clothes would be off and wed be having sex. I mean its sad to say but even thinking back on this is sad to me to be honest. At times I was so tired. I was always late to work. Id stay up with him until 3 every morning and wake up at 530 to go to work and somehow raise 2 kids when I got home. How did I even survive??? I should have been exhausted. \n\nNo he has always been abusive. It never changed. Just changed form. I knew very early on something was wrong with him. I looked it up and narc is the only thing I could find but it didn't exactly fit. I hadn't seen the whole picture yet. Well now its 7 years later and I see it all. I've been through the discards, triangulation, him being a selfish prick. I couldn't see it for a long time but he was always selfish. \n\nI am getting so far off base on this post. I just remember the first little inklings of him trying to break me down. It started so soon, so suddenly. It was always his plan to break me down. Now while we're nearing the end (I know the discard is coming) he is so loud and openly cruel. It seems like he is really fucking evil at times. The way he says I'm stupid and he hates me. I can just feel the fucking hatred seething off of him. And maybe I am just a idiot who deserves his hate. I don't know. I just know I never felt like that before I met him. No one ever told me that before I met him. I'm not perfect. I do have a lot of problems and so many flaws and baggage and shit I need to work on. Maybe that's the problem... \n\nHe will never find fucking perfect but I'm sure he'll find someone close. Someone who will give him money anytime he asks. Someone who will have sex with him anytime he wants. Someone who drives as well as he does and doesn't forget anything on the 10th trip to the store that day for him. I'm sure she will always laugh at his stupid jokes and listen to him talk about himself all the time. She won't have any wants or needs of her own. She will be there just to serve him and make his life easier. And she will not even care when he cheats on her because she'll realize it wasn't his fault... He just couldn't help it. He's a man after all and anyway it's in the past so she'll know to get over it. She'll learn to keep all her deep thoughts and opinions to herself. Her dreams and her goals(unless he could profit off them of course). She can lose all her friends and family. She doesn't need them cuz they're stupid!!! It will just be him and her in perfection!!! \nThis is what I imagine anyway. For some reason I have this fear that the next girl is going to be some amazing superwoman type woman and she is going to be able to make him happy like I never could. But why do I even care??? Why??? It's not even logical for me to think someone could live up to his standards but for some reason I just know she's better than me. That maybe I really am the stupid crazy one. I am the fucking problem. Maybe I am... I don't want to believe this but it eats at me. \n\nHow can someone so strong become so brainwashed and sad??? This is how it happens. You always look at abusive relationships and wonder why the person stays. You just never think you could be that person. \n\nEdit to say omg I'm bawling right now and it feels so good because I usually feel like a fucking robot... I keep my emotions at bay because they make him uncomfortable. I'm still a human fucking being. And as much as a try to distance myself emotionally from him this shit really hurts me. He really hurts me. I just can't let him know that because I know he doesn't care. I don't think I've cried around him in almost a year. Not like I'm around him now but it just feels good to cry. I just wanted to say writing this has helped me sort some thoughts and feel a little bit better. I wonder why we have to sort things like that? I feel like I'm putting this puzzle together and just trying to get to the last piece. The last piece needs to be me leaving his ass. I know I will be so much happier. The kids will be happier. He will be happier (not like I care what makes him happy...even though I really do tbh). I have got to plan my exit guys for real\n ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This further emphasizes in my mind that there are more of us out there that have gone through the experience of having a Nex than we know. Remember we're in this together, and  together we will become better! \n\nSo...back to the topic at hand, in the last entry I talked about the importance of understanding the why, Why was I attracted to my nex? The second part is to set up boundaries, but it's not as easy as to say, \"well I will set up boundaries\". We after all have gone through a traumatic event, many of us will experience the many stages of grieve; shock, denial, anger, bargaining, depression, testing and then finally acceptance. Along the way we may even earn a little of self respect. What's important to note is that in this stage we are susceptible to being influenced one way or another. This is after all the principal of gaslighting. Under normal circumstances most of us would not have put up with the toxicity that we did. But these are extra-ordinary circumstances. \n\nJackson Mackenzie talked about the need for a constant. The re-assuring factor in our lives that will guide us to our ultimate goal. But what is our ultimate goal? That's something that each of us has a clear definition (or is building) on. On the way to trying to obtain that goal, I find that humans have the most satisfaction by resolving issues. What I call the small battles. \n\nYou want to not feel sad? Give your life some purpose and go about solving it, but I am getting a little distracted here. \n\nWhat just happened? Well.....we were taken advantage of, in the worst way possible. 'The rape of the mind' is a terminology i tend to use when describing gas lighting.  It's not something that I wish to be associated with, but there's no better analogy that can describe what we went through. \n\nSo, how to be set up boundaries? Well first off, the journey continues from the conclusion of our last chapter. Self love.....but what does that have to do with boundaries? Everything. \n\nSelf love is something that isn't easy to come by, it takes a lot of work and repetition. But how does one fall in love with themselves? Remember my term on the small battles ? We learn to love ourselves by treating ourselves with the same respect we expect in others. For those of us who grew up with narcissistic parents/guardians this is a new terminology for us. We grew up walking on eggshells trying to not disrespect the head figure that demanded so much of our attention. As adults how do we reprogram this way of thinking? Well.....little bit at a time. \n\nFor those of you going through this process I have one question: Why is it, that we engage in relations with others ? I am not talking about romance, I am talking about in general. There are several answers to this I can think on top of my head, I am sure many of you can come up with your own:  \n\n\n-\tConfidence \n\n-\tSocial Status \n\n-\tAsking/Offering Help\n\n-\tLooking for Connections \n\nThe list goes on and on.....but there's something that's key here with all the things I've listed. Everything we seek in others, we can always fulfill in ourselves. It's this realization that allows those caught in co-dependant relationships to finally leave. It's also the main way of thinking that we need to use in order to resolve the trauma the narcissist left behind. \n\nWhich brings me to the point of boundaries: \n\n-\tNo person, no matter who they are, is worth your dignity\n\nSo, when it comes to being put down, being pushed into situations that you're not comfortable in....here is no need to put up with it. \n\nDon't get me wrong, positive criticism from those we love can be a good thing. Those that truly love us will try to point out things that they feel are hold us back. But a true friend/loved one will also respect our need for space, should they ever cross the line. There is no excuse for someone to bring you down. No matter who they are. \n\nIt's ultimately up to you to have healthy boundaries, and to establish what you're willing to put up with. You have to love yourself enough to know that no person is worth losing a part of yourself. \n\nSmall battles....always add up. Self respect is the battle to end all battles in your life. I'd be lying if I said I always felt self confindent and a high level of respect. Our ups and downs are a key aspect of what makes us what we are. But during moments of doubt, I know I will be ok in the end. This is the greatest gift the narcissist gave me. She taught me that even through the worst of the worst, I can bounce back and smile again. Now....I have the willpower to walk away in moments of doubt. \n\nSelf love, and more importantly self assurance is your biggest defence against the narcissist. Will you ever into one again? Most likely....but this time, you will be willing to walk away. You will know that you're going to be ok, with or without this person. This is the breakthrough of having boundaries. Once you have them, all other aspects that you sought in others, will no longer apply to you. You will know that you will be ok without having someone else there. \n\nAt the end of each day, we answer only to ourselves. Can you see yourself in the mirror and truly be happy with what you are?.....that's a question I have for all of you today. If you're happy, state one thing that makes you happy. If you're not happy, state one thing you're going to do today in order to change that! \n\n* Mr.Bluelove\n \n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was stressed about money and brought it up... she said nothing she ever does is good enough, I talk down to her and proceeded to call me an asshole for days. She made me move in another room and said we needed space and she didn\u2019t want to do this anymore. It was almost relieving. \n\nMy mind is in a dark place. I went out Friday with someone who I\u2019m not attracted to in the slightest, but just genuinely good people. I stayed at my work friends the next day and the day after. \n\nI woke up the first morning of going home to her going through my phone and asking about the person I hung out with. I have nothing to hide. I have not been with anyone else. \n\nShe got in my face and wouldn\u2019t let me leave the room. Phone in one hand and coffee in the other I hit the coffee out of her hand because it was splashing and in my face. I just wanted out of the room and to go downstairs. She was about to step back into 3 flights of stairs so I grabbed each of her arms. Looked her in the eye. Moved her to the side and went downstairs. She then proceeds to yell at me that I just pushed her against the wall while following me down the stairs and yelling. Her 10 year old daughter comes out of her room and hears/sees everything.\n\nShe took the keys to our house and threatened to call my command and tell them if I didn\u2019t leave. I had no choice. She\u2019s done this before. The first time sent me to inpatient.\n\nToday I found out she contacted an office on base that deals with domestic violence. I\u2019m now under investigation. \n\nThe hurt just doesn\u2019t stop. I\u2019ve lost everything about myself that made me. I have no interest in anything and I live/lived to serve her and her daughter. Everything I bring up is cut off and switched to her or her daughter. She does the same to my kids. It doesn\u2019t matter if I speak up or stay silent, in the end, I \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d and all I do is \u201churt her\u201d.

I want this over more than anything but I feel so empty inside. I feel like I have nothing. Today I tried reaching out to other people I thought would have my back and they just turned their back and basically said, \u201cI told you so\u201d. \n\nI feel for you. Each and every one of you. This is miserable. I would hate to think that others are in some random bedroom with the lights out, sitting on the edge of the bed and typing on reddit because they don\u2019t have another option.

I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years and the first 6 months or so were amazing but it kind of went downhill from there, we went through a really intensely bad period that lasted a long time and nowadays things aren't too bad although there are some things/incidents that make me feel really off about the relationship. I'll just write a list of some of the things he has done/does down below;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Completely blows up over the tiniest little things, he does this to me and his family. For instance, one time we were at a party and state up really late. I woke up with him and went home and wanted to go back to sleep because I was hungover and had had a really bad sleep on a sofa. Somehow this devolved into a screaming match that lasted for hours and ended with me crying my eyes out. Other times, his family might ask him to do something around the house and he will start screaming and screaming and there's literally no calming him down. He will also hit things and knock over furniture, and when I tell him he needs to calm down as it makes me really uncomfortable (he knows I grew up with domestic violence in the home) he turns it around on me and argues with me for being in a bad mood with him. The thing is he doesn't even necessarily do this on a weekly basis, it just comes at random.\n* In 3 years he has made absolutely no effort to get to know my friends and family (back when I still had close friends) despite the fact I know all of his friends and family really well. In fact, he came to one party I was at two years ago because I really wanted my friends from college to meet him. I couldn't believe his behaviour. He went round to all the boys saying he could beat them up, made really inappropriate comments all night and wouldn't stop even when I begged, then when I had to take him home and leave early he went up to the hosts of the party little sister and called her a little c-word. This was the last time I've been invited anywhere. Whenever I bring this up he says \"they weren't your real friends anyway\" \n* Always raises his voice and shouts, and then when I am literally calmly talking back to him and asking him not to he will accuse me of shouting and screaming even though I know I haven't been and literally try to convince me otherwise.\n* He always used to blame me for ruining his life and making him lose all his friends when he stopped seeing them as much, now he's more satisfied with things he never does. BUT I often get upset because I don't have any close friends anymore and have become completely isolated, I never blame him though but one of his standard responses is to say \"is it my fault?\"\n* The whole time I've been at university whenever I've thought about doing something that could make my experience better like a work placement year or semester abroad he puts the idea down as stupid and says I just need to get university over and done with. He encouraged me to drop out a lot as well. It just seems like the opposite of encouragement to me.\n* He puts me down all the time but in a very joking way (unless he's drunk), like he will call me \"flubber\" or something even though he knows I'm insecure about my weight. Then I will get offended because he's clearly implying fat and he will just laugh and say that's not what he meant.\n* Whenever we're out with his friends, I'm constantly the butt of the joke. He always makes me out to be like white trash, ugly, masculine, and slutty. He even puts songs on in front of everyone and sings about me, literally putting all the focus on me when he knows I hate that.\n* Constantly prods and pokes me and grabs me in personal areas even though for three years I've been telling him it annoys me. He constantly hovers right next to me and invades my personal space when I'm trying to do things like get changed or wash dishes even though I constantly ask him not to. \n* Coerces me into doing sexual things when I don't want to, never takes no for an answer and will literally spend an hour breaking me down and then says things like \"I feel like I'm raping you\" like????\n* Since I have been with him I have started smoking weed since he is a habitual smoker, whenever I don't feel like smoking some he gets angry with me and accuses me of being in a weird mood. He also makes the amount that I do really large even when I ask him not to, then if I cant finish and ask him to do it for me he will get angry and make me.\n* Says things like \"if my girlfriend ever cheated on me I'd half kill her\" which makes me scared to leave because even though that isn't cheating I feel like he'd take it as a betrayal.\n\nI've also had friends tell me I need to get out of this relationship, and my roommates at uni heard us argue and they said they were worried about me. I don't know why I refused to listen and now it's an even worse situation because I don't have my friends to fall back on. I'm just not sure if this is actually an abusive relationship because I'd say in general we got along fairly well and maybe I'm just focusing too much on negative stuff.

I remember when I was about 8 that I fell off of a trampoline by getting caught in the net and smacking on the ground. I should have been scared or sad that I just fell but other than the physical pain I felt nothing. My parents rushed over expecting me to cry but I didn\u2019t really feel anything. Then later when I was in middle school I was sleeping over a friends house and something really funny happened and I knew it should of been funny but I didn\u2019t feel like laughing. My friend was almost in tears crying of laughter and I didn\u2019t feel happy. I pretended to laugh and thought not finding dumb things funny was all part of growing up. After a while and everything in my life settled down I am starting to get my emotions back. I don\u2019t ever cry, like once every year or two when something extreme happens usually from my past, or even get angry. I do feel happy though. I usually feel happy when I should be feeling mad or sad. It\u2019s not just a smile but I get the actual feeling of happiness. I recognize the emotion I should be feeling but I only feel happy instead. It\u2019s like in Inside Out, Joy knows who should be pressing the emotions button but she\u2019s the only one there to press the button. I  seen as a very happy person, which I am, but I do miss experiencing a healthy range of emotions and being able to emote them. It is getting better though not that I am starting my twenties instead of happiness when I get mad or sad I just feel generic feeling number 1. It\u2019s like almost the feeling of nothing but with a flutter in my chest. Again back to the move reference like if all those emotion characters are running around waving their arms not sure who should press the button and whoever decides to barely tap the button. In express cases of sadness or anger I still either shut down if it\u2019s really bad or just feel happiness but I think it\u2019s slowly getting better. Anyone else feel similar or have questions?

Thanks to anyone who makes it to the end and can shed some light on this. \n\nI met this guy in my first year of college when we were both 19. I\u2019d only had one relationship before that ended in being ghosted basically (although we didn\u2019t call it that back then lol). I had (and still have) quite serious MH issues that meant my self-esteem was incredibly low. I saw this guy a bit for a few months and he was really reluctant to commit to a relationship and basically took advantage of my naivety and friendliness. He made comments about my body that made me feel ashamed and unattractive, but I thought that because he still showed me attention, he could see past this unattractiveness and others wouldn\u2019t. Low self-esteem meant that even though my friends were telling me I could do better and he was taking advantage of me, I still defended his behavior. One night he sexually assaulted me (I don\u2019t want to go into details), and I was so messed up that I figured this was probably normal in a relationship. A few weeks later he committed to the relationship and we were together for about 2 years. In that time, he gradually ground down my self-belief, so I didn\u2019t have any confidence in any of my own thoughts or opinions. He drove away my friends and still I defended him. I find it impossible to get into the frame of mind of that person, because it seems so obvious now. I was being treated horribly and didn\u2019t realize. It gets worse.\n\nI started seeing someone else and broke up with him. He went crazy, smashing things, smashing himself, threatening suicide. In my worried and confused state, I made the ultimate fail. I decided to stay friends with him. \n\nHe was still able to exercise control over me during this time. He\u2019d message me several times a day, asking what I was doing and where I was, and I\u2019d\u2026 answer. If I didn\u2019t respond, he\u2019d just keep messaging until I did. The other relationship didn\u2019t go anywhere and I was single for a while, and I think in his head I was still his. He\u2019d occasionally ask if I wanted to get back together, and I\u2019d tell him no, I didn\u2019t think about him that way. I started dating someone else and he got really depressed, but seemed to decide that he\u2019d rather stay friends than lose me for good. I was really uncomfortable and starting to recognize how fucked up the situation was, but seeing how he went crazy after I dumped him, I was scared. It gets worse.\n\nOver two years after the breakup, he was still in regular contact with me. I got a job in the same town as him (it was a good job and I\u2019d been unsuccessful getting other jobs), and without having somewhere to live, he offered me a couch. This is something I will never understand. I accepted his offer and moved in. I feel sick writing this. I moved into a house with someone who, at that point, I recognized was emotionally manipulating me, and who I knew had sexually assaulted me in the past. It only took a couple of weeks for things to get really dreadful, with him constantly having a go at me for not giving him enough attention, and then acting all apologetic when I said I\u2019d move out. Fortunately there was another housemate who stood up for me and didn\u2019t leave me in the house alone with him \u2013 although it was probably having her around that made me stay so long. I wanted to move out, but he seemed to want me to stay. My boyfriend thought it was messed up and weird but he knew I had absolutely zero feelings for the other guy and found him repulsive. It\u2019s been two years since I moved out of there \u2013 I was on the couch for 6 months \u2013 and things are really good in my relationship right now, but the ex is still bothering me by any possible means. I\u2019ve told him I don\u2019t want anything to do with him and haven\u2019t intentionally been anywhere near him in a year. I\u2019ve blocked him on Facebook and on my phone, and ignored the emails he sends to my personal account. He still works in the same (big) company as me, in a separate building, and has resorted to using the IM system to try to contact me. Once he crept up on me at the bus stop and just started having a conversation at me. I have panic attacks when I hear from him or see him from a distance. It messes me up for a whole week. Yes I am looking for a new job. I sent 60+ applications last year, and didn\u2019t get anywhere. \n\nI know his actions have been (and still are) really gross, but the thing I struggle to live with the most is the knowledge of my own actions in this. I put myself in these situations, time and time again, even after I recognized how gross he was being to me. I feel so so dirty, and judged, and horrible, and suicidal. I want a new body, one that he hasn\u2019t touched. I am a different person now, looking back in horror at how I let this happen. I don\u2019t know how my boyfriend can possibly love me when he knows about this guy and what the situation was. I feel unworthy of love and affection. I feel unworthy to call myself a survivor, knowing how much responsibility I hold for what happened. \n\nTimeline, for clarity \u2013 2010, met this guy; 2011-2013, in a relationship with this guy; 2013-2015, we\u2019re \u2018friends\u2019 i.e. him messaging me several times a day; 2016, I get this job and move in with him for 6 months, then move out and cut contact; 2017-present, he\u2019s still trying to get back into my life. \n\nEdit; change of verb tense", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

We started dating at 14 and dated for 8 years. We've been broken up for 3 years this April and I thought I'd be over everything that happened by now, but I'm just not. \n\nIn the 8 years we were together he was good at turning me against my friends and family. Made me feel guilty for wanting to spend time with them. On a couple of the (several) occasions I found out he was cheating on me, he threatened suicide if I broke up with him for it. Eventually the relationship became a matter of me avoiding his explosive anger and name calling just to avoid the panic attacks that came with it. \"Cunt\" \"whore\" \"harlot\" were my daily names. I wasn't allowed to be better than him at anything- if I was, it was luck. I actively made myself bad at things just to avoid his bullshit. It didn't stop there though, because *of course* it didn't. After we'd been living together for a while (and I'd gotten anxiety medicine that ended up killing all emotions including sex drive) I started waking up in the middle of the night to him raping me. After he bragged that \"you respond better in your sleep than you do when you're awake\" I learned how to sleep through it, so I'm not sure how many times it happened. I was on the edge of suicide before I managed to get out.\n\nNow, it's been almost 3 years since we broke up and I was fine up until this past year. The first 2 years I had my ho phase and avoided relationships like the plague because I wasn't about to get involved with that again. I didn't think about the relationship for longer than a few moments- usually just to say \"I'm better off without him.\" to people having pity for my engagement falling apart. Last year I met my current boyfriend and he's been fantastic- really supportive, kind, respectful, loving. Basically everything my ex never was. He's also the victim of a past abusive relationship so we relate and connect on a lot of things. But it seems like the happier I get, the worse the nightmares get. I've had nonstop nightmares for almost a year about my ex. Some of them are memories, some of the nightmares are that I broke up with my current bf to go back to him because he threatened to kill me. Ones where I never left him at all and I'm married and trapped. The more serious my bf and I get and the more we talk about our future together, the more my nightmares reflect all those things, but with my ex because that's the direction we were going in when it ended. I'm always tired. I haven't had a good night of sleep in ages and I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm starting to catch myself treating my bf like my ex- little things that should be nothing set me off and I have to try and explain what's going on to my bf who doesn't always understand what I'm trying to say (English is his 3rd language).

{"post_id": "agny24", "created_utc": 1547662448, "title": "This Is My Story", "author": "lovinitup93", "self_text": "TLDR at the bottom\n\nI have recently been sharing my story and I thought here would be a good place. I don't want to hear how strong I am or how sorry anyone is. This is a part of me that I have to live with and that is all I see it as. \n\nHere are my short forms so no one gets lost!\nB is my sister\nK is my mom\nM is my mom's husband (the abuser, not my biodad)\nC is my brother\n\nIn hindsight I see the abuse started much earlier than I thought as a teen. Probably around age 8 or 9 M started wearing down my self confidence and worth. Looks were a very big deal in my house so I was often told I looked ugly or fat (when I was skinny as a rail). It was common in my house to hear M say \"look at the rack on [insert name]. That's hot!\" Basically that was a daily occurrence. \n\nSkip ahead a year or two and M started bursting into the washroom while I was showering, about age 9-10. I was very uncomfortable with this and let him know that but it continued anyway. I couldn't lock him out either since there were 2 washroom doors- one through the hallway and one through the master bedroom. I tried to lock the doors and the bedroom door but M kept a key to them with him and if I locked the door he would dump cups of ice on me. I couldn't even get away by showering while he was at work because he worked from home. \n\nBy age 12 I was use to this. It was a daily occurrence of me being called fat, not getting to shower without being intruded on. I was constantly angry. That year we moved to a new house but in the same school district, this is important later. Now we had 2 bathrooms and M couldn't  invade my shower anymore. I thought this was over. I was wrong. \n\nAt 13 I was getting ready for high school. There was a program K came across that she thought I would benefit from. The catch is it was at a school across town, which meant leaving all my friends. I was told I had to apply. I got in and was told I was going to that school and even though we moved to be able to stay at the school we were at I now had to start a new school with no one I knew.\n\nStill at 13 M had taken an interest in my sexuality. I am straight and never wavered from thinking that. I had 1 really close friend who I hung out with pretty much every day. Since she is also female M would constantly berate us and insist we must be lesbians- neither of us are- and he wouldn't let up on it.\n\nSo at age 13 I was told I couldn't go to school with my friends anymore, was constantly being called fat still (at 5'4 and 85lbs), and being told I had to be a lesbian because I was close friends with another girl. It wasn't a great year for me. \n\nBy the time I turned 14 and was starting high school M had started molesting me at every chance he could. His office was the 3rd floor of the house and basically everyone stayed on the first floor so despite my screaming for help no one could hear me. Eventually he started threatening me that I didn't stop screaming he would make me stop. I tried everything to make him stop- calling him a pedophile, fighting back- but remember I am tiny- etc, but I quickly realized it was futile because he wouldn't stop. I thought K knew what was happening so I never brought it up to her. I was also afraid if M stopped with me he may start with B and I was not willing to trade her safety for mine. In my eyes I was already damaged and she wasn't so I wanted to protect her. \n\nAt 15 M tried to make me switch to the closer high school because \"it's too expensive to have to go across town every day\" I convinced K to let me stay instead of having to be isolated again. In hindsight I see M was trying another way to wear me down and isolate me further. \n\nAt 16 K confronted me about being angry all the time. I told her what M was doing and she tried to get him to stop. K persuaded me not to report this to the police since M owns his own business and we could go bankrupt if I did. I never reported him but I did start staying with my dad half the time. \n\nSeveral years later K left M because she could no longer stand being around him (he was emotionally and financially abusive towards her for the entire 20 years they were married). C and B still went to see M occasionally. C was 16 when M and  C had a big blow up. M blamed C for K leaving and C broke a picture so M pushed C through a wall. Clearly at that point M had not changed and C went nearly 2 years without talking to M. \n\nFast forward to November 2018. M confronts me about not having seen him since my daughter was born in August 2018. I tell M I can't let my girl be anywhere near him and he knows exactly why. M tries to guilt trip me into seeing him but I refuse. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for reading and letting me share. I am married with 3 kids (2 boys and a girl) and my biggest regret is trying to make K's life easier by allowing M to meet my boys and occasionally seeing him. My husband agrees we shouldn't have done this as well. My heart aches because if something had happened to them I would never forgive myself. \n\nTL;DR \nMy abuser started abusing me at 8 and this continued until I was 16 and basically moved out. I ended up being pretty normal all things considered. I hope my story can shed some light that things can get better and they will with therapy and time.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

The morning she was screaming at me and I tried to leave the room. She then blocked the door and started to push me back, I am quite a lot bigger than her and had been berated for 30 mins so I walked past her, as she was pushing me, and out of the door. She is now claiming that I hit her and I have heard her crying on the phone to family members.\n\nWhat can I do about this?

The ex tells me that I can see her when she grows up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe ex refuses to tell me the child's full name or D.O.B.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then tell her that I will get a court order for genetic testing. \"Do whatever you want,\" was her reply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI called her husband to get a better since since he had indicated that he no longer had an issue with me (this is a whole other story that I will skip over for now). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe told me to go to court if I wanted to see my daughter. I believe that he caused the child to cry in pain during the conversation. It could be that she happened to get hurt by another reason at that moment, but I believe him doing it is more likely because the crying came from close by and started all of a sudden.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI did end up filing a motion in court to get a genetic test. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter further research I have come to learn that if a child lives with a married couple for two years after a child is born, the child is then conclusively the child of the man that lives with the mother.  I have no case to ask for a test. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**In any case, my analysis is as follows:**\n\nThe ex was using birth control that I could always see by way of trans-dermal patch. \n\nI believe that she used me to get pregnant to get back at her husband for the rape. \n\nShe then hid the child from me so that I could not make a claim in court. \n\nHe in turn (being the rapist control type) is happy to be the father, as now he can further control his wife. The child is not his. He can do whatever he wants without remorse (I am assuming he has more empathy for his own children).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI believe that she contacted me for a hoover or to rub it in, but my feeling is hoover from the way I started to feel and because she told me that she called \"out of concern\" for me. \n\nI didn't react to the hoover as much as she likely hoped. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn any case, I told her how it is, i.e. the above analysis. The conclusion and court action came quickly relative to the time that she contacted me about 1.5 weeks ago. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also told her that she will need to come to court to say that I am not the father, that I would not withdraw my motion for genetic testing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Does me identifying her actions for what they are help change her mind in any way?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Is there a chance that she comes around for the child?**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe has already withheld the child for 3 years. If she gives me some visitation without a court order, she can pull the plug at any time - which is likely the control she seeks. I figure if I can't be the legal father that I will forgo any relationship with my daughter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can only hope that she comes around and \"thinks\" about the child. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He controlled my future, suffocating my dreams that involved something different than he wanted. In some ways, I am much better now.\n\nWhat I still struggle with is dating-or talking to people with that intention. I have ghosted a LOT of people. The main problem was my ex wanted to get married to me badly and way too soon. Honestly, I think he wanted to get away from his family and saw me as his knight in shining armour. He suggested marriage three days from meeting (as a long time distance thing) and I didn't mind once I was convinced that he was just confirming he was looking for the commitment that I was raised to have.\n\nSo this means that ANY time anyone is friendlier to me than \"bro\" levels or \"meh, let's see what happens\" I run. Even my mom, who has encouraged me not to make romance a priority my whole life (egalitarian family-my parents have the healthiest relationship I know) has been worried about me on this.\n\nThe closest I got to comfort was another queer Christian who I felt more comfortable around because he wasn't straight (versus my ex who had a lot of hang ups about dating a bi woman but I was his \"adventurous, butch pixie dream girl\" so it was part of the knight persona). Even then I still interrogated the dude. No wonder there was no second date even if we talked for hours. Hell, we never established if it was a date but I didn't want my ex to be the last one.\n\nI am worried about dating-like I have to give up my physical autonomy or my life autonomy. Part of me wants to stay single but after a year of being convinced I would be married with a kid or two I am terrified of being alone after my parents are gone. But I am scared of what I give up. I want a kid, but my health will not allow me to raise them on my own-not yet anyway. \n\nTldr: I want to get over my fear of getting out there again, and want to know how to keep my autonomy but am too worried about being single when my parents pass because I got adjusted to the idea of marrying my ex (despite breaking up two years ago).", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I didn't expect myself to have so much resilience, but after 7 months of NC, I'm finally ready to let her go for good.\n\nI was looking at a common friend's Instagram account and saw that she still had a couple pics with my Nex-friend. But for some reason, I just laughed. I could finally laugh and not feel shaky or nauseous at the very thought of stumbling across her profile. Still not unblocking her, but I noticed I'm doing way better since I deleted her pics from my phone and her number, threw away her half-assed gift (**tmi:**&gt;!peed on it before flushing it down the toilet!&lt;) in a glorious way, and generally been moving on with my life. \n\nI may be somewhat alone now (my only \"prominent\" friendships are online, most of them are kinda on hiatus because we're all far away from each other), but I feel way, way better alone than with such a... less-than-decent human. She doesn't even deserve to be called a bitch. I don't feel tired all the time anymore. I have nearly no suicidal thoughts, I have no more constant nausea, I'm no more feeling like I walk on eggshells. I have no more fear to detonate a bomb by saying the wrong thing or doing what I want to do. I sent a letter to my great-aunt and told her about what happened with my Nex-friend. She was the only family member I told about her, and it will stay this way. No one else will know about her.\n\nThose 4 months, from February to June 2018 (technically. I knew her since January 2018 but barely talked to her until February), were probably one of the worst, yet most teaching months of my life, and I finally can say no to people. I can know now that some people are just screwed and will abuse you when they feel you slipping away from their control. I realized my Nex-friend was most likely pissed because no matter how hard she tried to ruin my fun, I would still enjoy myself and want to come back to the places we visited. She was trying to control my feelings by saying \"be honest\", \"why don't you do x thing\" (like, taking a crap ton of pictures, while I prefer to use my memory), \"you don't like \\[place\\], be honest\", and didn't respect me for who I was. I remember it good, she was always telling me \"It's not good. You must change\". If I didn't do things her way, I couldn't possibly enjoy myself or be a good person, because her way was obviously the only way to go. *My way or the highway*, as narcs go. \n\nShe was only nice to me when she needed a picture or something else. Hell, she even made sure that the slight possibility of making friends with random people we'd meet was aborted, she would trash-talk me in Korean to them, and right as I was next to her. No wonder why they always looked uneasy, at first I thought it was me who was the weird one, but actually... they might have sensed something was wrong with **her**, that she was secretly backstabbing me the whole time. She would destroy the few boundaries I had, like, walk around naked when I told her I wasn't comfortable with nudity, or taking me to restaurants even though I told her I preferred sandwiches. She would tell me about how she could eat and eat and eat, then throw up, then eat and eat and eat again while I'm frightened of vomiting. She'd do so many things I told her I wasn't okay with. And I was too exhausted to call her out on it until it nearly escalated to physical abuse. She shoved me and I felt that if I didn't walk away, she would possibly start to hit me.\n\nIt was never my fault. I stayed because she was my friend. I stayed because I wanted to solve our problems, but she didn't want to. She preferred to cause more of them by acting like a total ass and trying to ruin my good time and then put the blame on me. I learned that if people aren't going to accept you for who you are, they're not worth your time. And that it's okay to walk away, especially after having been betrayed, insulted, and (publicly and privately) degraded.\n\nShe won't exist anywhere else than in my memories, now. And I'm ready. I'm ready to go. \n\nI wish luck to everyone of you. It may take months, years, decades, but in the end, you'll be free.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I feel so alone and I keep attracting narcissists. It's a cycle I can't seem to get away from. I've been studying all this for years and I still get friends that use and abuse me and an ex partner. Now for 3 years I had a woman play me. Pretended she loved me then turned around saying she was just drunk. I wish I knew why I put up with her for so long. I am an INFJ and Empath and these people have sucked me dry to the core. This last woman played mind games with me so badly it landed me in the e.r. just like my family has done.

This is gonna be a long post, so I apologize for that but I think that every bit of what I'm about to say is relevant.\n\nI'm 18 right now and I live with my dad. Most of the time it's just me and him. Him and my mom divorced in 2014 when I was 13 and in the eighth grade. My mom is in her 40's (can't remember her exact age but she was born in 1974 or 1975) and my dad is turning 60 in February. Needless to say the age gap between them was huge and this led to a lot of abuse in their relationship. He abused her in basically every way you could think of just short of making threats on her life. \n\nMy parents were also verbally and emotionally abusive to me and neglected my emotional needs most of the time. When my parents divorced for a little while (\\~6 months) things were practically perfect, I could come home from school without bolting to my room to hole myself up and my grades started to improve. Dad was kind and caring and much calmer than mom was. Ex. if I got sick and wanted to stay home from school he'd let me stay home without yelling at me about how I shouldn't fake being sick. \n\nMom obviously has trauma from her relationship with dad but now she has a caring boyfriend who is exactly the opposite of my dad personality wise which is good. She still has episodes of being manipulative but now that I'm older I can shut her attempts at manipulation down with moderate success.\n\nAfter that first 6 months or so after the divorce, dad went back to his old ways. Now that mom was gone there was nobody for him to take his anger out on except for me...he never laid hands on me though. Most of these abusive episodes would happen when he was drinking or if he was unable to drink ex. taking me to my chorus concerts in the evening. He's the only person I've ever been sincerely afraid of. So I learned to avoid him and to not reveal any emotion to him at all. I couldn't move in with mom because she lived out of the school district and I'd have to swap schools which would've been hell because I'm autistic and have social anxiety disorder.\n\nSometimes dad would go off on me over something minor. Back in July I asked him if I could spend another night at mom's house and he went off on me and said he bought some donuts at the store for me but that he'd throw them away. Then he called my mom only to rant at her about how ungrateful I am. He was drunk when all of this happened of course.\n\nWithin the past few years dad has also developed a very dangerous habit of letting random women move in with us. I never really get too close to these women because I know that they'll be gone in a few weeks. He used to falsely accuse them of stealing money and would call the cops on them and make them kick the woman out but now he just tells them they have to leave. I ended up talking to one of these women and she told me she met my dad on a Monday and that he gave her a ride to jury duty because her ride bailed on her, and he let her move in that following Friday. I do truly feel sorry for these women because I know it'll end badly for them but I know if I did tell them to get out and find a better way to live that they'd tell dad and he'd get onto me for stirring the pot. The only woman who he didn't kick out forcibly was a woman who I'll call Sally and she stayed with us from August to November and she left because her probation ended and she could finally see her kids again so she chose to go home to her kids. \n\nLike I said before, I'm autistic so I have a lot of trouble adjusting to these random women moving in and out constantly. When I came home from mom's this Sunday there was another woman here and today dad kicked her out and took her to a homeless shelter. I do feel bad for her because I've heard some horrific stories about homeless shelters but I'm also glad to be able to be more comfortable in my house again. \n\nAnyway here is where all this gets relevant. While Sally was here dad was very docile and kind. I figured she was just pacifying him and after she left I kept waiting on him to blow up on me. Cut to Christmas day when we visited his mom and he told her he hadn't had a drink in four months. I feel so conflicted about this...on one hand I'm happy that he quit but I'm also bitter. Like, you wait until your only child is 18 to quit drinking? On top of that this is scary for me too in a different way...I don't know how to have a relationship with him because I've spent so much time trying to avoid him. I also suspect he quit drinking for Sally (since four months before December was August which was when she moved in) and not me which feels like a betrayal even though I wasn't expecting anything. \n\nFor all these years I've hated him but now I don't know how to feel. As I said earlier he's turning 60 next month so he doesn't have much time left, and within the past year I've had some nightmares where he dies and I've woken up crying. So I'm clearly attached to him still. My cat is also 11 years old so I know he's gonna die soon too which is freaking me out badly too, just as much as all this stuff with dad.\n\nIf you've read this far thank you so much. I just want to get this off my chest and see if other people feel similarly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Sorry it's so long....", "author": "LittleMissK17", "self_text": "I need to tell my story, it may be long...but I don't know where else to go.. \n\nMe and mom lived with her family until I was three, she had her fair share of abusive relationship so she was used to hiding and looking for a safe place. Anyway, I was three when we left my grandmothers house...she was no safer than any guy so. We went to live with moms new boyfriend. I remember looking up at him and asking if he was my special daddy, I had prayed for one every night. I was too little to remember some things but...let my story really begin. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first thing I remember is I was 3 or 4 and I can't remember what I did. He put me in a dining room chair, duck taped my mouth, and handcuffed my hands behind the back of the chair. He used a rag to keep the cuffs from leaving a mark, and he would leave. I remember crying for hours until he came back and mom just watched. She even called him once to make me stop crying. I would scream so much that the tape would get wet and come off, I would fall asleep from crying so hard... A few days later he asked, no, told me to go get some board games out of the back of the car before school one day. I knew i had to carry them all in one trip or I would be in trouble. I was so little, I got them out of the car but they fell and the pieces went all over the ground. He came outside as I was picking them up and said I was playing with them. He grabbed my arm and drug me inside and sat me on the end of their bed. I told him I was just picking up the pieces but he swore I was lying, he put his hand around my neck and made me say I was playing the games. I went to school and the counselor noticed i looked scared and upset, I told her what he did and lets just say he was even more upset when I got home....I can't talk about that yet... \n\nI remember one night i think I forgot to say \"yes ma'am\" and he got mad at me...He took me into the garage with a wood cutting board. He whooped me so hard he broke it then kept hitting me. When that finally snapped he used a plastic one until I was crying so hard I stopped breathing. Mom made him stop, I was red and I was bleeding....a few days later we were doing dishes and I guess I didn't do what he told me to so he picked up a heavy plastic serving spoon and hit me in the head with it, then again on the hand when I went to hold my head. Mom didn't believe me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter she figured out he was abusive to me too much we moved in with another guy. He was nice at first, until he wasn't. One night he came into my room, I was half asleep but I knew what was going on.. I was 4 at the time. He sat down beside my bed and started to touch me, my chest, down to my stomach...I remember him pulling my pants off and touching me, telling me I was a good baby doll....This happened on occasion, once or twice a week until mom put an alarm on the door. One night they got into a fight, he shoved her into the wall so hard she had pieces of drywall on her clothes. We went back to the other guy....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like I blacked a lot of the start out, I only remember when they went out to work and I was in the car. I didn't like ever being away from mom, I was afraid after everything that happened. I started to cry and scream for mom as they walked away, he got mad when I didn't stop crying. He picked up a huge stick and pulled me out of the car and gave me, not what i call a spanking, I call it a beating. Once again I had a bruised butt and back. I didn't know what I did wrong... don't remember anything for a lot of years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMom started college again and that left me home with him after school. For the most part the abuse was directed to mom but I still remember it all. I would come home to his truck gone, glass on the floor, holes in the walls, and mom crying in the shower, seeing a new bruise and another lie. I would walk in, drop my bag on the floor...check on mom then go clean the mess. I remember one really well, the plastic table in the kitchen (we lived in shitty apartments) was flipped over, papers and things everywhere. A glass shattered in the sink, a hole in the wall and water cooler. I checked on mom and picked up the table, putting the papers back, cleaning the glass carefully, putting the water cooler back together. Not ever asking what happened, just doing my homework, playing outside and waiting for my brother to come home from work. This continued until she got a job..then I start home school and he was there 24/7. Now, he was older than mom, 25 years older to be exact. His kidneys went out so he stopped working. Here's where it bounces back to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe fought a lot, his abuse was mostly verbal to me. Calling me a heartless bitch at the age of 12, telling me I was a horrible child, spitting out the words \"I'm not even your father so I don't have to deal with you.\" The truth I didn't know until that hateful moment. One day he got mad at me for something regarding school, he got out of the chair throwing it behind him and storming upstairs...but changing his mind. I saw the anger in his face as he turned back around to run at me. I ran to the spare room that was down there and closed the door, locking it...praying he would just leave. I hid in the room for an hour, my phones battery came out when he threw it....I snuck out and grabbed the battery racing back to the room...terrified. I didn't know what to do. Later that day, the same problem about school....I walked away from a fight like my counselor told me to and he got angry, he grabbed my arm and shoved me into the wall, yelling at me to listen to him and do what he said. For the first time, at 13, I wanted to kill myself.  I soon stopped talking, I stopped smiling, I never left my room unless I was in the backyard, or mom was home...I didn't eat. I was weighing 85lbs at 13 years old. He gave me a few bruises. Mostly he enjoyed tearing me down. Whatever I felt was wrong and didn't matter. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen mom filed for divorce I was sent to live with my grandpa and his new wife whom I adored. It was okay, except he was abusing mom again... It got bad. Soon it was done but another nightmare began. He was showing up at our house, he moved a block away from us...and was dragging us through the court system. I was 15 and being put on the stand to tell his abuse horror stories, begging attorneys to just end the disaster that was a trial. For 3 years it drug on. I was cutting myself, I tried to kill myself 3 times in the last year. At 16 I was put in a mental hospital for it, I wasn't safe to myself anymore. I got out and I kept cutting, he kept getting worse. We had even moved 3 hours away but STILL had to go thru hell. I prayed it would just end....I was tired of the fight and reliving the horror over and over again just to be some pawn in his sick little game....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, it was over...I remember the day I got the news. May 22, 2018. He was dead, he really died this time...I laughed at first, it was over, he was dead, it was finally over...then it hit me and I felt the tears. Despite everything he was a father to me for 10+ years of my life. He broke me, but he was a parent. That night I relapsed and I almost ended up in the hospital due to my cutting....I was bombarded with memories of abuse and things that I had  forgotten...Here I am today. Telling a small part of my story.. A 17 year old girl who still has a lot of issues. Who doesn't cry because it makes her weak, who can't trust...who flinches when her uncle tries to hug her. I can't be touched, I can't show physical affection, I can't ever feel safe in who I am. I don;t even know who I am...I was forced to be so many things that I don't even know who I am.....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's me....That's all. ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

We had a short exchange that helped me realize (1) we'd never work out and (2) this is who he is/this is what a narc is.  \n\nThis was our exchange. We've quite a tumultuous year and although I am in no way perfect or made our relationship so rosy and ideal, he was the epitome of living hell especially when I was pregnant. \nBut here was our exchange --  \n\nMe: \"I wish you could put yourself in my shoes and both feel and understand why I'm hesitant to give you money and why I'm approaching this situation as I am.

I'm not asking you to be in my shoes and still hold your same point of view/perspective. You seriously lack empathy and that's very concerning to me.\"  \n\nNex: \"Whatever.\" ....  \n\nThe conversation had more back and forth but in that moment, in that short exchange I just saw him tell on himself. He simply can't be empathic, truly see from anyone's perspective but how he feels in the moment as it relates to *him*. And in all honesty, it helped drill home the fact/knowledge that we'll never work out. I can't possibly be with or remain in a marriage with an individual who simply lacks any form of empathy or understanding for the other individual. It is sad. I'll always love him but I can never be with him again (nor ever give him anymore of my money).  \n\nI hope you all continue to stay strong and fight the good fight &lt;3 \n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She watched it all happen and knew how much I was suffering. She would go tell him when I did something wrong, knowing what would happen to me... And then she would stand there and watch. On rare occasions she would try to help, but as soon as he told her she was next, she went back to just standing there. Once we got out, I was understandably extremely angry with her for her role in everything. I wasn't allowed to talk about those times because 1. She didnt like it 2. She wanted my siblings to love their dad and wouldn't tolerate me reminding them of what happened. My grandparents did nothing but defend her inaction for all of those years by dismissing everything I said and saying \"yeah well she was afraid of him too.\" \n\nI remember multiple times, she said she was taking me and getting me out. She told me to pack my stuff and I was so overjoyed for it to finally be over... Only for her to tell me to put my shit away because we were staying.

Three weeks since I\u2019ve seen or spoken to him face to face. If you read my post history, you\u2019ll see I\u2019ve been trying to leave for nearly a year, and that process began over a year ago before I ever started posting on here about it. \n\nIt took probably 4-5 tries before I got it right. Every time I tried and failed, whether to financial stress or emotionally not being ready, I felt like such a failure. But every time, even when I couldn\u2019t follow through, I feel like one rope at a time was cut that was tying me to him. These last three weeks it\u2019s like I\u2019ve finally seen the spiderweb I was so willingly caught up in. I can finally see our relationship from an outside perspective. The toxic fog has lifted and I can breathe and think and function. I still worry about finances and feel lonely, but not any more than I did when I was with him. He destroyed our finances at every opportunity and was always looking for things to spend our money on, while I had to figure out how to pick up the pieces and pay our bills. As soon as he got home from work every day he\u2019d go straight to bed and watch stupid videos on his phone. He gave so much attention to his fucking phone, and none to me. He\u2019d sleep in the guest room most nights so he could stay up for hours watching porn and chatting to women on dating sites instead of being with the young, attractive, devoted woman he married. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019m not missing much. My life has continued on without him. I have my two dogs with me, and my daily life hasn\u2019t changed much besides the fact I\u2019m in another state in an apartment of my own now. He left me alone, used me, and destroyed my confidence any time I tried to confront him about it. I was so addicted to the idea of him that I was willing to take care of his every need and kill myself working to make him happy and provide a good life for him, while he did absolutely nothing in return. He only love bombed long enough to keep me strung along and then dropped the act as soon as he felt things were secure. This last year though, I didn\u2019t even get the love bombing to keep me going. I was literally his blood bag, draining the life out of me to keep him going. And for so many years I considered this virtuous, that I was being a good wife, that this is what self sacrificial marriage looks like, for better or worse. \n\nI will not be anyone\u2019s supply ever again. I will not be a blood bag to be drained and discarded. I ripped the IV out of his arm when I left three weeks ago, and the fallout was tremendous. But I\u2019m here, I\u2019m alive, he didn\u2019t kill himself, the world didn\u2019t end, the sun still rises, and I\u2019m happy.

I\u2019ve never seen him that way and it got me. The night before I was tossing and turning and almost woke him up at 2 am to talk. So when he approached me in the morning I was relieved. I don\u2019t want to end it. If it were entirely up to me, I\u2019d fight for this.\n\nLast week he did approach me and say he wanted to make this work. He stressed that I need to just get over things and move on. Clearly it\u2019s not that easy and that\u2019s asking ALOT. In no way did he approach it with any sort of reassurance that he would be doing the work necessary on his end to meet me halfway to get us to that point. It was more like \u201cyou\u2019re holding onto things and can never move on\u201d When things are never addressed, that\u2019s what happens.\n\nAnyway, I realized I didn\u2019t want this to happen and have regrets. (Like I said, once I\u2019m gone, there\u2019s no turning back, I made that promise to myself.) Is he really a narcissist? Or is he just very selfish and lacks the capability to handle his emotions on top of being very lazy? Or is that what a narcissist is?  I\u2019ve really tried hard not to diagnose him but there\u2019s way too many similarities that raise the red flag. \n\nSo, I let my guard down for a moment and told him I didn\u2019t want this to happen and regret it later. Was this just a series of unfortunate (6+ months long) of events that spiraled out of control fueled by supercharged emotions?  I told him that I\u2019d be willing to do the work that it takes to \u201cget over things\u201d but he has to be willing to do the work to help me get there. That\u2019s what a relationship is, isn\u2019t it? I explained that the way he approached it last week made it seem like he just wanted me to move on without doing any of the work on his end. He said that was crazy to think that and it\u2019s a terrible assumption. Call me crazy, but I won\u2019t know things unless you say it. Moments like this require reassurance and he did not once offer to do what it takes to help me get over things. Even if we aren\u2019t sure we want to go down that path, I offered to put my move temporarily on hold to give us time to clear the air and make a proper decision \n\nThen he was hesitant. He said there\u2019s been so much damage and blah blah blah. Exactly what I told him last week when he approached me. I said it because I was on guard. Why is he saying this? Why apologize and tell me you\u2019ll always be here for me?\n\nMaybe I\u2019m a die hard romantic, but I\u2019m ready to fight for who I love. Shit got real and I was ready to man up and do what it takes to get over this- TOGETHER. \n\nI needed to know by last night so I can get things squared away for moving. I went out for a bit and never heard a response from him when I came back. I wasn\u2019t going to approach him again, he knows where I stand and he knows I had a deadline. \n\nSo I guess his decision was made. He wasn\u2019t willing to do the work. Oddly, I feel like a weight has been lifted. I still feel terrible and broken, but lighter. All those months of confusion, wondering how or why my husband wasn\u2019t stepping up to the plate and meeting me emotionally and spiritually. True confirmation that his words are empty and I wasn\u2019t crazy all along. I know I gave it my all and was willing to walk through the mud, but he wasn\u2019t. \n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This is My Story", "author": "lovinitup93", "self_text": "TLDR at the bottom\n\nI have recently been sharing my story and I thought here would be a good place. I don't want to hear how strong I am or how sorry anyone is. This is a part of me that I have to live with and that is all I see it as. \n\nHere are my short forms so no one gets lost!\nB is my sister\nK is my mom\nM is my mom's husband (the abuser, not my biodad)\nC is my brother\n\nIn hindsight I see the abuse started much earlier than I thought as a teen. Probably around age 8 or 9 M started wearing down my self confidence and worth. Looks were a very big deal in my house so I was often told I looked ugly or fat (when I was skinny as a rail). It was common in my house to hear M say \"look at the rack on [insert name]. That's hot!\" Basically that was a daily occurrence. \n\nSkip ahead a year or two and M started bursting into the washroom while I was showering, about age 9-10. I was very uncomfortable with this and let him know that but it continued anyway. I couldn't lock him out either since there were 2 washroom doors- one through the hallway and one through the master bedroom. I tried to lock the doors and the bedroom door but M kept a key to them with him and if I locked the door he would dump cups of ice on me. I couldn't even get away by showering while he was at work because he worked from home. \n\nBy age 12 I was use to this. It was a daily occurrence of me being called fat, not getting to shower without being intruded on. I was constantly angry. That year we moved to a new house but in the same school district, this is important later. Now we had 2 bathrooms and M couldn't  invade my shower anymore. I thought this was over. I was wrong. \n\nAt 13 I was getting ready for high school. There was a program K came across that she thought I would benefit from. The catch is it was at a school across town, which meant leaving all my friends. I was told I had to apply. I got in and was told I was going to that school and even though we moved to be able to stay at the school we were at I now had to start a new school with no one I knew.\n\nStill at 13 M had taken an interest in my sexuality. I am straight and never wavered from thinking that. I had 1 really close friend who I hung out with pretty much every day. Since she is also female M would constantly berate us and insist we must be lesbians- neither of us are- and he wouldn't let up on it.\n\nSo at age 13 I was told I couldn't go to school with my friends anymore, was constantly being called fat still (at 5'4 and 85lbs), and being told I had to be a lesbian because I was close friends with another girl. It wasn't a great year for me. \n\nBy the time I turned 14 and was starting high school M had started molesting me at every chance he could. His office was the 3rd floor of the house and basically everyone stayed on the first floor so despite my screaming for help no one could hear me. Eventually he started threatening me that I didn't stop screaming he would make me stop. I tried everything to make him stop- calling him a pedophile, fighting back- but remember I am tiny- etc, but I quickly realized it was futile because he wouldn't stop. I thought K knew what was happening so I never brought it up to her. I was also afraid if M stopped with me he may start with B and I was not willing to trade her safety for mine. In my eyes I was already damaged and she wasn't so I wanted to protect her. \n\nAt 15 M tried to make me switch to the closer high school because \"it's too expensive to have to go across town every day\" I convinced K to let me stay instead of having to be isolated again. In hindsight I see M was trying another way to wear me down and isolate me further. \n\nAt 16 K confronted me about being angry all the time. I told her what M was doing and she tried to get him to stop. K persuaded me not to report this to the police since M owns his own business and we could go bankrupt if I did. I never reported him but I did start staying with my dad half the time. \n\nSeveral years later K left M because she could no longer stand being around him (he was emotionally and financially abusive towards her for the entire 20 years they were married). C and B still went to see M occasionally. C was 16 when M and  C had a big blow up. M blamed C for K leaving and C broke a picture so M pushed C through a wall. Clearly at that point M had not changed and C went nearly 2 years without talking to M. \n\nFast forward to November 2018. M confronts me about not having seen him since my daughter was born in August 2018. I tell M I can't let my girl be anywhere near him and he knows exactly why. M tries to guilt trip me into seeing him but I refuse. \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you for reading and letting me share. I am married with 3 kids (2 boys and a girl) and my biggest regret is trying to make K's life easier by allowing M to meet my boys and occasionally seeing him. My husband agrees we shouldn't have done this as well. My heart aches because if something had happened to them I would never forgive myself. \n\nTL;DR \nMy abuser started abusing me at 8 and this continued until I was 16 and basically moved out. I ended up being pretty normal all things considered. I hope my story can shed some light that things can get better and they will with therapy and time.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Now that I\u2019m home my father does weird things to me as punishment for being sick and a \u201cpussy.\u201d \n\nI was admitted to the hospital after starting college in the fall. I had internal bleeding from inflammatory bowel disease (Crohns). I got septic shock, was on a ventilator in the ICU, and almost died. I was in the hospital for the next several months. I dropped out of college and moved home to my parents house in December and was readmitted. Been out of the hospital for ~10 days now. \n\nMy dad has no concern for me. He calls me every name he can think of and yells at me to not show any weakness, as if I didn\u2019t already know this. He is irate because of the medical bills. I want to work but I do not feel good enough yet. \n\nHe controls my every move. I can only sleep when he does, 6-7 hours a day even though I have needed 14-20 hours daily since I\u2019ve been sick. He wakes me at 6 AM and calls constantly throughout the day to make sure I\u2019m being productive\u2014chores, errands, job applications (which I have to show him when he gets home). It takes every ounce of energy in every cell in my body to do these things. Sometimes he comes home during lunch to make sure I\u2019m not sleeping. When he gets home later he hits me (not hard) every 30 seconds to wake me up because I can\u2019t stop falling asleep on the couch. I often can\u2019t go to bed until midnight, long after I\u2019m ready.  \n\nHe is obsessed with my bathroom habits. If I get up to use the toilet he pins me down and steps on my stomach. He won\u2019t let me go until I beg him for several minutes. He does this even though he knows I have a lot of pain and urgency from my disease. On Monday I did not make it to the bathroom in time because of him. He also bangs on the door if I\u2019m taking too long or intrudes and gives me no privacy. He laughs when he does these things. \n\nMy meds haven\u2019t worked so far, but I am hopeful about my current one. When my symptoms are not controlled I have a fever daily for weeks at a time, chills and aches, internal bleeding, vomiting, extreme fatigue, diarrhea, and other details I will spare you. I am on an IV 12 hours a day that puts food directly into my veins (called TPN) because my body can\u2019t absorb nutrients properly. I\u2019m not supposed to leave the house without a medical mask because my immune system is shot. All I want to do is sleep. \n\nSometimes I feel like I\u2019m crazy and that I\u2019m faking my illness or just seeking attention. I feel guilty and worthless and can see why my father hates me. I internalize what he says to me to such an extent that I am too ashamed to even admit when I\u2019m tired. This has resulted in pretending that I\u2019m ok until I\u2019m in a medical emergency. It has been a huge internal struggle but now I at least realize why I do this to myself. \n\nHe is not evil. He used to physically abuse my mom and me when I was little but he got help with his drinking problem and started being an OK father. He is drinking again and is under financial stress but more importantly is still dealing with the death of my older brother, who was killed three years ago when he was 18. On the day we found out my father told me never to cry about it. But I know it affected him because I heard him crying a few times when he thought he was alone. My family does not talk about my brother, ever. I think my dad resents me because my brother was killed instead of me. These are the only things I can think of to explain why he is like this. I have tried to prove myself to him my whole life and was successful at school, sports, and in my social life. \n\nNo one knows that this is happening. I can\u2019t seem to make myself talk to anyone about it and anyway my dad said he would kick me out of the house if I tell anyone. A stranger on reddit has helped me through the past few months and I am grateful to her.\n\nI told you all of this shit because I need to know how I can get through to my dad without sounding like a baby.

I\u2019m the first to admit I was naive, for the past few years I had been in a bubble of university and in a relationship. When I lost everything I thought I would have I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself. We met when I just needed to feel something, anything other than sadness...

Your way of controlling me was to say I had to prove myself, prove I could be mature enough for you. So I did but you realised you had me... so you tested this.\n\nThe control started small, inviting me over for the weekend but making me wait in your house while you went out, cook food for you but not allow me any... little things but it showed you you were powerful.\nYou hated if I stopped coming over and spoke to another man but would flaunt that you had slept with other women... and yet I stayed.\n\nIn truth this was when I became scared of you...but I kept coming back... why did I come back! That\u2019s the worst part for me.... but then you escalated.\n\nYou always pushed me in the bedroom to do things I didn\u2019t like... choking me until I nearly passed out and had finger marks on my neck I had to hide.

Nearly breaking my neck but telling me to stay still until you were done.\n\nThe first time you assaulted me was when you came to pick me up, walked into your house and you told me we were going upstairs and I had to do it because I owed you.... my self respect died a little that day I did as I was told.\n\nThe second time was when you pushed and pushed me into doing a painful act in the bedroom, to the point I was scared to say no. It hurt so bad but you told me I had to now it had started. You then mocked me for letting you do it claiming you had taken something from me and that I was damaged goods now. \n\nAnd the time I openly said no... that I didn\u2019t want to have sex... you did it anyway and I had to lay there until you were done. \n\nYet I kept coming back, kept sleeping with you, kept letting you use my body... until one day I just didn\u2019t anymore.... my skin crawled at the thought of you.\n\nThe strange thing was I didn\u2019t even realise you were an abusive, manipulative rapist until recently. When I told this to a friend and she made me see you for what you are. Disgusting, a predator who preyed on my insecurities, youth and naivety. \n\nBecause of you I struggle to trust, I have no self worth, I\u2019m terrified of authority figures. And even though I\u2019m in counselling I can\u2019t report you... you\u2019re a 30 something year old respected policeman... I\u2019m a girl in her 20\u2019s back in university trying to make something of my life.\n\nHe said... she said. It\u2019s what you count on.\n\nSo this is my way of telling you what you did. I hope on some level you know but if you don\u2019t maybe this will clarify it for you... pressuring, bullying, manipulating and downright forcing a girl is rape. \n", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

She is 70, he is 45. He this last year again lied and sucked me back into his life, and had introduced us. All the while we are meeting at night and having an affair; but of course lied to me for a long time saying she has this lawsuit and I feel responsible for it as I pushed her to do it .. \n\n. For so long I wanted to tell her and break them up so he could be all mine! Sick I know. However, during this time I\u2019ve gotten to know her, and he uses her. She helps pay his bills, buys his groceries, cigarettes, and booze every week. He has pushed her to do stupid shit financially so he would benefit from it .. all for money never for love.  \n\nWell I have walked ... and I feel horrible this lady, is being lied to and manipulated and being taken for a ride on the last years of her life, that she is investing her money and leaving all she has to him. \n\nMeanwhile he brags about it to me. She could actually meet a nice man still .. someone who loves her, takes care of her, respects her not emotionally abuse her.  \n\nFinally after 6.5 months I think she finally caught on some as out of nowhere during our fights he had told her she is not allowed to speak to me unless he was involved. She has spoken to me and wanted us to get together for lunch one on one.. while him and I were fighting I told him you shot yourself in the foot .. she has a clue and we\u2019re going to lunch on Tuesday or Thursday. Well I couldn\u2019t go Tuesday cuz of a biz mtg and hadn\u2019t heard from her today so reached out to what place to meet. Back up one step, I hadn\u2019t spoken to him since Monday am leaving his house. And yesterday, he reached out concerned which I knew was BS .. and IK he was fishing to see if we had met up as he clearly had no explosions Tuesday evening... well what do you know today she is to busy, matter of fact she is so busy she even has to work Saturday and now has zero time to meet me.. \n\nI sent her a nice text letting her know I really was hoping we could meet up and wish she had or could make the time as I don\u2019t want to convey all I would like to convey in a text message.  \n\nIn the beginning, it was easy didn\u2019t know her, and really disliked her as she kept me from my narc. Now I just want her to know the truth, know that he brags she is living everything she has to him. That he is lying and using her.  And I also know this is the one thing that would make him burn the bridge of us.  This poor lady was to retire in October and is still working so she can pay for her stuff and his.  \n\nAm I wrong by wanting to share and tell her all?  I know it\u2019s gonna hurt, but at least she knows after that she can do whatever she wants .. stay with him and continue supporting him or leave but I truly feel she deserves to know the truth.

I had long detailed post but I did it with low power and lost it and it took a lot out of me so here\u2019s the abridged version. My mum has way to much control over my life and has isolated me and sleep deprived me for years by trying to manipulate me. She uses me for my disability befits and bus pass.\n\nShe rarely sympathises when I\u2019m sick and often actively exacerbates it. As a child she did things like make me clean up my vomit while I was still vomiting. I haven\u2019t been to the doctors in a decade except two times the school made me and that\u2019s where something I can\u2019t confirm comes in. No one has ever believed me that I\u2019m sick. My primary once literally gave me in trouble for saying I was going to be sick and then was shocked when I was actually sick. The same thing happened and my scouts. My grandparents occasionally call me a hypochondriac despite the fact I never tell people I\u2019m ill because I know I won\u2019t be believed. The two times I\u2019ve went to the doctor I\u2019ve been not believed dispirit the fact I\u2019m nearly at the stage of collapse. The thing that really flagged up that it was exceptionally weird that no one ever believes me was at a camp.\n\nNow I can\u2019t go into the camp because it take an eon to explain is I went to a camp I\u2019d went to the year previously and I was sure it would help me recover from a person in authority trying and almost succeeding to ruin my life (not getting into it). Basically a bunch more traumatic stuff went down (that is so bad I tell no one because I know people will think I\u2019m making it up and I\u2019m done with being not believed or called a bummer for bringing up horrible stuff) but and no one in a possession of authority believed me or did anything (male and female) and one of them let slip she believed I had clinical paranoia (I have Asperger\u2019s) I said no I don\u2019t why would you think that and she claimed I said it in the canoe, she back-tracked and apologised. There was also an event earlier where I had fainted from not having eaten in 6 hours while climbing a monroe and the leader said he\u2019d send me home in the same was as he said to people who faked illness to get out of the horrible camp.\n\nRight now I\u2019m getting over the same illness I usually have. My mum told me to drink spirits and paracetamol to help. (I\u2019m 18 in the UK) and this got me wondering why this recurring problem has never been properly looked into . As a child they went back and forth on me having asthma but they\u2019d never help and me asking for an inhaler made people disbelieve even more.

We were fairly close friends for about six months up until the summer, and our friendship had actually started with him having romantic feelings towards me, which dissipated after I got together with someone else (now my ex). \n\nAfter about six months our friendship started to become deeper. We realized that we liked a lot of the same movies and music (I know it's typical, but this really had an effect on me). Some of the things we had in common were so rare and esoteric that it felt like it was fate. I started to become increasingly attracted to him after this for the period of about a month, but doubted he still felt the same about me. One night, however, we ended up hooking up, though afterwards he said he didn't want anything serious. I was in a really negative space at the time (having recently broken up with my ex) and denied my true feelings and went along with this as if I didn't want anything more. After hooking up one more time, he insisted we stop being physical and never were intimate again after this. I didn't speak my mind because I hated myself so much and I thought things would just end there.\n\nHowever, throughout the rest of the summer we hung out all the time. He kept insisting we watch movies and do things together, and because I felt there really was a genuine connection there and felt like he was the first person who really \"saw\" me for all my true personality and interests I didn't say no. I found myself simultaneously pining after him, hoping one day he'd change his mind and want a relationship with me while also preventing myself from and hating myself for wanting that from him. So our connection grew stronger, even after leaving my college town to come back home after that summer to work. \n\nThroughout the next four months we still texted very frequently, almost once a day sharing memes or information we thought each other would find interesting. It really felt like I was dating someone who wasn't actually my boyfriend, but I still went along with it because of my poor self-esteem.\n\nA couple of months ago, I visited my college town again and we hung out. I figured he'd probably been hooking up with other people since we parted, but I was not prepared for him to tell me he was hooking up with one of my friends, who was in our same theatre group, who had been the roommate of my best friend the year before.\n\nI was shocked yet felt like I didn't have to right to be hurt. So I grinned and beared it until I was about to say goodbye to him and finally decided to stand up for myself and be honest about my feelings. I told him it was stupid, but I still had feelings for him and it hurt me when he constantly texted me because it gave me that small burst of false hope every time. Instead of respecting this and saying he'd text less and distance himself, he just gave me this weird, emotive yet empty speech about how special I was to him and that it was \"indescribable\" what I was to him.\n\nIt felt so weird. I could finally see the emptiness behind his eyes that I'd somehow never glimpsed before. All the time I was hanging out with him, I did feel slightly uncomfortable and constantly criticized, but I had assumed it was just me assigning my own meanings and insecurities to his behavior. I've been told my whole life I was too sensitive, and just thought I was overreacting to his cruel comments. \n\nI didn't fully realize that he was toxic until I was driving home. We had parted ways as friends, but now I was finally realizing that he didn't deserve my friendship. So I decided to go no contact, and despite many attempts from him the first month, have not responded or given him any attention for two months now. He hasn't even asked why I've been silent, and the only contact I have gotten from him has been superficial, such as memes or things about films and music we have in common.\n\nI know he isn't good for me and that it was ultimately the right decision for me to cut him out my life, but I just can't shake the feeling that I'll never feel the connection I felt with him with anyone else ever again. I haven't dated anyone since this or received any kind of romantic attention, and I'm starting to feel painfully lonely, especially when in my darker times I start to think about him and compare myself to his life of popularity and attention (he's very VERY popular and charismatic within our group of friends). \n\nI guess I just want reassurance that I'm worthy of love and not a freak for not finding it again yet. I constantly feel that even though I know he displays the hallmark traits of narcissism, he is ultimately \"winning\" in life and I'm just a pathetic, loveless, and lonely person who is still seeking his approval even after I've consciously decided he's bad for my health. I know this is from a preoccupation I have with keeping up with people and being a perfectionist, but no matter how hard I try, I can't help but feel inferior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR (as this has been a NOVEL): I had a brief affair with a narcissistic man (who was also my friend for a long time), and have not had ANY romantic attention or prospects since and I still find myself missing him.

They see you as the best thing since sliced bread; you're flawless. You can do no wrong.\n\nThe thing is, it's not really *you* that they're so into. Not the real you. A narcissist doesn't really know you, and frankly doesn't really care to. They're obsessed with their fantasy of you. The image that they have concocted of you in their childlike mind. They think that you're perfect and that you're the one who can solve all their problems and make them feel better.\n\nIt is very easy to fall for this kind of idealization. I'm guilty of falling for it myself. You enjoy someone treating you like you're special, you enjoy the flattery. But what happens is, you get hooked on the narcissist's approval this way. You see how they think you're so perfect, and so you try to live up to that image and you want to keep them happy with you.\n\nBut, since their perception of you isn't actually about you at all, inevitably you *will* fall from grace, and by that point, they have complete power over you. Because you realize that you're not making them happy anymore. You realize that they no longer see you as perfect. And so you scramble about to try to regain that status in their eyes. You bend over backwards and turn yourself inside-out, just to get their approval and validation back. This is where you can lose yourself completely, because you end up sacrificing yourself in numerous ways trying to live for them. Trying to appease their grandiose ego.\n\nThis is why, whenever you notice someone idealizing and love-bombing you like this, you DON'T let it go to your head.

I started following this sub last year after the \"love of my life\" left me. I could go on and on about this situation but it's kind of the typical cyclical situation. I was lovebombed, then discarded, rinse and repeat. I started to catch on to the trend when we didn't talk for four months and I started to date someone else who...drumroll...treated me like a real human! \n\nI knew that going back would be disastrous but I'm a sucker for a tragedy. She reeled me back in as my career started to take off and I couldn't resist. Again, I was lovebombed, rinse and repeat. Only this time, I knew it wasn't personal. So I didn't feel pity for myself but my god it still hurt because the emotions I feel are actually real! \n\nSo why do I keep going back into this relationship when I know it's toxic? Well... her family practically adopted me. You can't imagine what that is like, I come from a broken home. To feel like I belong and matter, it's amazing, and she cultivates that emotion against me. She has cheated on me, gaslighted me more than imaginable and you know what, also contributed to some amazing growth. \n\nAlright, so why am I here now? Well, literally just moments ago, I was gaslighted and discarded. She left the same way she did the first time, blocking me from all social media within a minute of leaving my house, saying some incredibly hurtful things, the most hurtful being \"you will never hear from me again.\" Why? Well, after a year of not being friends on Facebook she added me. I was able to finally see behind that privacy curtain into her personal life, which is funny because I've been a huge part of it \"supposedly.\" Well, I asked her who someone was in a picture and bam! I got hit heavy with the \"you're a jealous asshole, blah blah.\" In her defense, in the past I have been jealous but tbh, I literally just asked who this person was. \n\nIt was late and we were in bed so maybe I had bad timing? \n\nI asked a few times and she wouldn't answer me so my tone started to raise with hers when the eventual answer came. \n\nI know in hindsight, I could have done things differently but I guess isn't that part of it? They make you feel like you did something wrong? Please take my word for it, I wasn't upset when I asked and I felt no jealousy, I was just curious. \n\nThanks to this community I think I said the right thing as she was leaving, she was telling me that I was a jealous asshole and a few other frenzied mean things and I said \"I'm not a jealous asshole. You are gaslighting me. I simply asked you a question and you refused to answer. You also decided that you wanted to leave instead of answer and as a man I don't want to be with someone who jumps to such an extreme over such a simple question, so I'm glad you are leaving my house and I don't want you to come back.\" \n\nAs much as I am happy I told her off, I am sad she is gone and being blocked from everything hurts. And the last part was a lie, I do want her to come back, she just made me upset. Why are they so irrational and extreme? I really do care about this person and we were making progress towards her getting into therapy. I think her friends caught on to the fact that her tirade against me last year was a smear campaign and they are encouraging her to get help. She is seeing a doctor tomorrow for her 'anxiety' and hopefully that leads to seeing a therapist for bipolar disorder, which is something we have talked about in the past.\n\nIf you read this, thank you! If you comment, thank you! Please refrain from saying anything bad about her because I didn't get on here to talk bad about her. I came here to get some support for myself, as a man I have to stay true to the fact that I told her I don't want to be around someone who acts like that, but it's gonna be so hard because I love her so much.

Also should i try to gain full custody? as a male i know its hard. but she's kind of entertained the idea that i am the better parent, but then her life is just as she wants. drunk, lost weekends, no accountability! if she has to share custody i guess her game will have to step up.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She exhibits many of the traits  \\[a sense of self-importance, arrogance, entitlement, anxiety, lack of empathy, selfishness, obsession with control, manipulation, envy of those with more, love of dramatic situations, lives in a fantasy world\\]. She also has an issue with intimacy. She likes having sex but these days is very embarrassed about it. When we got together she had a fantastic body, didn't mind being naked, but after a few years she gained weight through no other reason than overeating. This has led her to put on weight and be embarrassed when naked. I say to her I don't care, but it doesn't make any difference - she always wants to have sex with the light off and ideally with some kind of covering on \\[duvet, dress etc\\]. I imagine this is because she is worried about how other people \\[i.e. me\\] perceive her in spite of what I say. \n\nThis is not the story I want to tell though. Really it's about intimacy in general. When we got together she was very happy to be affectionate with me in public. Kissing in public was no problem at all. Then one day we were in a pub, kissing near the bar and the landlord said to us, \"all right, that's enough of that\". It shocked her and changed her behaviour permanently. From that point on she never wanted to kiss in public, and hardly ever in private. Mostly it's just pecks on the lips. It's been like this for years. When I asked her what the problem was re the landlord's comment, she said, \"people must think I'm a prostitute\".  \n\nIt worried her so much that it's never been the same since. She can hardly even hold hands in public, she is so worried what other people think of her. I remember one time we went out together she sat rigid on the train next to me, scared stiff that people would think I'd hired an escort to go out with me for the day \\[she said the same thing, \"do people think I'm a prostitute?\"\\].\n\nMy question is, are these the actions of a narcissist? I am thinking they could be since a narcissist would be very concerned with how others view them. But I don't want to interpret everything under the banner of NPD unfairly.

All the gas lighting, all of the put downs and all of the times I was told I was not good enough, and I didn't deserve better, and that it was my fault I was being treated this way; got through to me, and so I put up with it up. This relationship did involve sexual coercion on her part, on several occasions that I did not want to have sex. Let's call her R.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt one point during this relationship R had gone on a trip with university, R told me after this trip that R had got drunk with a guy there and she said he took advantage of her, and had raped her. I supported R through all of this, I tried to take her to the hospital to get a rape kit done, or at the very least have her clothes bagged as evidence by the hospital staff so that if anything came of it, the police would have something, she refused to do this. I took a week off work to help her through this time, to encourage her to go to the police, and to be as supportive as I possibly could. I tried to take her to the police, and after explaining the story for 2 or 3 hours to the police R decided to leave when they asked her to fill in an official statement so they could investigate. I took R to the police station on 3 other occasions over the next week in attempts for her to do this, I was patient, and respected her wishes everytime she changed her mind.  In the end nothing was done, because she wouldn't make the statement to police. And that's okay. R never expressed any gratitude for the effort I went to help her out, she never acknowledged the week+ of work that I took off, that I had to make up within the next 6 weeks. She never thanked me, and only ever pointed out when I made some kind of mistake, or she perceived that I did something wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this time she went back to drinking and partying like she had been doing previously, she would always drink to excess, and would flirt with men in order to be bought drinks. She would go out without fail every Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday night; and would occasionally go out on Tuesday nights. Every night she would get absolutely wasted, to the point of passing out or vomitting. She would expect me to drive her around, even though at that time I was working full time, while also studying full time, and barely had time, but she would guilt me into doing this for her she would say \"she had no other way to get to classes, and she was still a provisonal licence holder so would get done for DUI because of the amount she drank the night before\". She would also use her rape as way to guilt me into picking her up after she had a long night out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't allow me to hang out with my friends, she didn't allow me to go out with my friends because some were female, and would verbally abuse me about how I wanted to hang out with girls over her, that I must have liked these girls more. One night I did go out with my friends, she told me I had to leave and go hang out with her after asking me if any of the friends were girls, and I told her they were.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis issue came out the most one night when I took R out to dinner, and whilst out I saw a girl who I was acquaintances with at university, at no more than a pass each other going to class every now and then, and speaking for 2 minutes once a week level. When I said to hi to her while we were out, R went absolutely ballistic, asking me how I knew her, and that I because I said hi to her, I \"obviously wanted to fuck her\", and she continued on with this tirade. And I just took it, because at this point, I just accepted that I was what she would say, a bad person, and a bad boyfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nR's habit of going and getting blind drunk ended up with her hanging out with some guy one night and then bringing her home. The only reason I found out about this, was because I went to surprise her with flowers and chocolate, and her favourite pastry. I'll never forget the feeling of finding out for the first time ever that you're being cheated on. They ended up having sex on multiple occasions, and like the idiot I was, I figured it was my fault I was being cheated on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow this next part might be hard to believe and I honestly wouldn't believe it myself, if it didn't happen. After basically hitching up with this guy, R accused him, to me, of raping her. At which point I told her I would step in for her and tell her, he needed to leave her alone. Now at first they did stay apart, but it wasn't 3 weeks until they started seeing each other again, and then another 2 weeks that she started to tell me how he would abuse her, and hit her. It was after all of this, that R told me that she wanted to move out of the bad university accommodation dorm room, in favour of an apartment; I asked her how she would pay for it, and she told me, that she would be moving in with this same guy. She continued to accuse him of abuse after they had moved in together. As you can imagine, given the circumstances, I can became slightly incredulous of her claims, given that she had decided to move in with this bloke, after she had accused him of raping her while she was drunk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis all culminated in me breaking up with her, after I came to at least partial senses and realised I was being treated badly, and the reason I was depressed was because of this relationship. I got told I should go away from uni for a weekend to a hotel somewhere and recharge, and do something purely for me, and do things that made me feel good. So that's what I did. I rented a a nice hotel suite for a weekend, it had a kitchen and a separate lounge and dining area. I treated myself and bought some nice red wine, and some cider, as well as the most expensive steak I've ever bought from a butcher. I had got a movie that day as well, and was going to watch that with my wine and steak. I was feeling good for the first time in a long while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt some point, somehow, this ex girlfriend found out where I was, (this still scares me to this day). She took it upon herself to come to this hotel, and walk there (this is important for later). At this stage I was pretty drunk, and I accept I chose to get drunk, because I wanted to, I wanted to relax and feel good that weekend.  So she came to the hotel I was staying at and managed to manipulate the reception staff into giving out my room number, and came up to my room. I answered, and she demanded I let her in, because it was night time and she was afraid. I told her several times I didn't want to see her, but she made her way into my room. I made an effort to be nice and polite. I went back to watching my movie. At some point I had moved to the bed and passed out asleep.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I remember waking up with her on top of me, having sex with me. I told her several times, loudly to get off me. I tried gently getting her off of me. Not only was she on top of me having sex with me while I was passed out, but she had done so without a condom, which at this stage I had not done with her before, and didn't want to do with anyone. Not only that, I know she had been having regular sex with the other guy, and who knows who else. Now at this stage I can feel myself getting close to ejaculation, and I don't if she knew this, or if she could sense it in my panic, but when I started trying to get her off me, she leaned down and tried grabbing me, and squeezing her legs around me, she whispered in my ear \"I want to have your babies so you can never leave\". This scared the shit out of me, and along with the fact I was nearing finishing, I got some clarity and ended up pushing and tossing her off me as hard as I could, and I had thrown her a considerable distance off the bed and onto the ground. Somehow, she still managed to get me to give her a lift back to where she lived, even though she had walked here the other night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took me a few weeks to process what had happened, and it was at this stage that she had contacted me again, after moving back to her home state after failing her classes her parents stopped paying for her tuition and told her to come back home.  Seeing her number come up on my phone caused me to have 1-2 hour long panic attacks, that at one point got the ambulance called on me. At some point I finally did speak to her, and she made the claim that she was pregnant from the night in question and that she was going to get an abortion. She told me the abortion was going to cost something like $900 and she was calling to ask for half of that money from me, because as she put it, this is \u201chalf your fault\u201d.  I finally found my self-respect, and I did not believe her, I had pushed her off well before I had ejaculated, and it all seemed very suspect; I also told her that that night in question was rape, and that any further communication of this nature, i.e. asking me to pay for an aborting would lead me to reporting her to the police. I haven\u2019t heard from her since, and she has dropped off the map, and I couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't worry I am acutely aware of stupid and clueless I was back then, looking back on this I feel incredibly ashamed I let someone do this to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter about 6 months post R, I met another girl, who I thought was amazing, let\u2019s call her M. She seemed to be very understanding, and very loving, and the sex was good and healthy; and I was allowed to take my time. It was in this time before meeting M, that I had a very bad accident, which has left me with a disability, and some bad PTSD. This relationship went on for over 3 years. However the last year became quite bad, and there was stuff going on I didn\u2019t see until afterwards, hindsight is 20/20.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will try to keep this brief. M was good at emotionally manipulating me, using my mental health, past issues, and my disabilities to gas light me. I have trouble with memory, however, I am always aware when I do. I am always aware when I forgotten something, there is a whole there, that is incredibly noticeable to me. M would tell me something I had done, or something I had failed to do, or when I questioned her as to something she had done, she would almost respond with something along the lines of \u201cwell your memory is screwed, how would you know\u201d she challenged my very perception of reality at almost every point where I tried to communicate with her about something she was doing that I didn\u2019t like or that I thought was mean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe could never take any constructive criticism, and would never listen to any of the problems or feelings I had about her or some of actions; she would immediately begin to cry, and accuse me of attacking her, and then would go in for retaliatory strikes back at me, with things she was \u201csaving up\u201d to throw back at me in some attempt to discredit any of my issues.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe also turned out to be a compulsive liar, and a narcissist. She would lie about the smallest things constantly, she would lie to me even when I knew the truth and told her. She would constantly point out my flaws, and everything I screwed up, I was struggling at this stage with my PTSD, and so it was difficult to be on top of everything in my life, and my disabilities restrict what I can do, and also leave me with a lot resentment and depression; and have also meant I\u2019ve been dealing with chronic pain for the last 3 years.\n\nIn the final year of our relationship things got very bad, sex was non existent, I felt bad for both asking for it, and bad for being rejected for over 12 months; it wasn\u2019t that I felt entitled to it, however previously in our relationship we had been fairly regularly physical. I found out at the end of our relationship why there was no physical component anymore. I didn\u2019t attempt to make her feel bad about any of this, and largely kept my feelings about constantly being rejected to myself, and I tried not show any of those feelings around her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt around T-7 months from the end of our relationship I had found out that she had been seeing a friend for the last 4 months secretly, as in lying to me about what she was doing when she was seeing this person. They had previously (before we had met) been in a physical relationship together for a short period of time. Apart from being lied to, I was fine with her seeing him, as she assured me they were just friends, and I wanted to see her hang out with her friends more often; however that was on the proviso that she didn\u2019t lie to me about seeing him. I honestly didn\u2019t care, I just don\u2019t like being lied to; in fact I was happy she was, because she seemed happier.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nT-3 months; I wake up one night (2am) to an empty bed, and start to freak out as to where my partner of 3 years has gone after walking around the house looking for her. I start frantically panicking about something happening to her. Her car is missing, she is missing, and when I call her, I can\u2019t get a hold of her. I\u2019m texting her, and calling her, worried sick. Finally I get a hold of her and she replies with \u201cWhat?\u201d. She then proceeds to tell me she went to his house, at 1am because she was struggling to sleep. Now you could be the least jealous type on the planet, and this would still be a giant red flag. And for me it was, and yeah, I did start to get suspicious, I found it incredibly difficult to trust what she was telling me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forwarding a little while to about 1 month before the breakup, I am using our iPad, and with M being the only one with an iOS phone, she has her phone synced up to the iPad.  While I am using it a series of messages come through that point toward something more going on between the two, messages to him, as well as messages to her friends. I wasn\u2019t trying to snoop, I was just playing Bejewelled, and these messages began to pop up.  I tried confronting her about this, and on come the waterworks again, as well as the \u201csaved up\u201d slights to try and negate her behaviour. She tells me I\u2019m crazy, and paranoid, and jealous, and that they\u2019re just friends. She goes on to promise me, and swear on her parents, that they are just friends and nothing is happening. She tells me how much she loves me and can\u2019t wait to spend the rest of our lives together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow at this stage, the proceedings for my accident are coming to a close and I have been awarded a decent sum in compensation for the accident and disabilities. At this point M suggests that I buy her a brand new car with this money, because she deserves it after \u201clooking after me\u201d and that her car now is a bomb, and needs to be replaced. So we go looking, and go for a test drive, and I say that I want to sleep on it, meanwhile she is champing at the bit to sign documents and get me to sign for a loan so she can have the car now and I can pay off the loan when I get my compensation. She gets quite upset about this, and becomes very distant after saying I need some time to think about a huge outlay of cash like this.  I don\u2019t feel comfortable getting into another car loan as a co-signer, because I know I will be the one paying the loan until I get my compensation, which is something I cannot afford, and she has racked up $12.5k in CC debt in the last 8 months because she has a shopping problem. She ended up applying for the loan and putting me down as cosigner, however she was denied because of her huge debt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow fast forward to the week of the breakup. She has been seeing this guy more frequently and for longer, at stranger hours, which causing my red flag alerts to be going off non stop, I can\u2019t help it. One night she says she is going to his place with a bunch of friends for a movie night, something in that made me not believe that at all. And whilst I am not proud of what I did, I am glad I found out, and caught her. I ended up going to his place. There were no other cars around except for hers, when she told me there were at least 8 other people there. And when I looked through open window from my car, all I saw was him and her, sitting alone together snuggling up, and making out. I texted her to ask her how things were going and how everyone else was doing. I watched her text me about all the people that weren\u2019t there and how they were all laughing and having a good time. She lied, and I caught her doing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomehow I managed to blame myself for this, for a week, until I finally broke it off with her, after she lied to my face after she came home and I asked her about. She didn\u2019t care whatsoever. She lied and lied and lied. For literally hours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway down to the issues. And my apologies for the rambling and super long story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel incredibly violated, and incredibly bad about all these things. I always blame myself for what happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to get help, I tried to talk to people about what happened. But I got met with the same shit, over and over, I had most people ask me \u201cSo what did you do to make her cheat on you, or make her so mad with you\u201d, my own mother said \u201cmen can\u2019t be raped. Did you get an erection? Well you must have enjoyed it then\u201d and variations on the \u201cdude you had sex, you should feel lucky\u201d. Well I don\u2019t. This shit haunts me everyday, and I looked in a lot of places for help and support, but was constantly met with the same shit, the majority of support services only cater to women, and when there is a for men support service, it talks about stopping your violence, and talks about you, the man, being the perpetrator.  I only ever found one place that was specifically for male victims of sexual assault. But everywhere else, it was either for women only, or the support they provided men was support in helping men stop abusing, and stop using violence. And seeing this everywhere I turned, every place bar one that I looked at for help, I keep getting told that no, you aren\u2019t the victim, you\u2019re the perpetrator. Constantly seeing this, and not getting any support, not even from my own family has caused me to not talk about this with anyone, and the few times I have felt brave enough to share a snippet of this story, I get shut down, primarily by women. And I can\u2019t take it. This has led me to being admitted into an inpatient mental health unit for a suicide attempt. After I was raped, I visited family in 3 states, and looked for support services in all of those states, and again was met with the same shit. And here is some of that stuff, and this is what is available today, this is what men looking for help will find.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/5w3h7Kg](https://imgur.com/a/5w3h7Kg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I am not trying to make some political statement, I am simply sharing my story and the difficulty I have had in finding any support services. I know women get abused, a lot, and I'm not asking for any of their services to be taken away, or anything like that. I am glad they get that support. But I would like to see men not labelled only or first off as the abusers. Because I guarantee that it is causing male victims to not seek help, because they don't feel like there is anything available to them. It certainly doesn't help us with the feelings of shame either about being a victim, when we constantly see how we are perpetrators.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd because of all this I now shut everyone out, I rarely if ever talk about this stuff. And it is affecting my relationships. I cannot for the life of me move onto the next stage of dating past meeting up for the first time. I can\u2019t get out of my head the thought that something bad is going to happen again, I am going to get hurt again, and I am once again not going to have any support. I am going to get taken advantage of. I cannot trust anyone. I cannot show my feelings to anyone. I cannot tell this story, because it seems like every time I do, I get lambasted about me being the cause of the behaviour directed toward me, or that I am weak, and a doormat. I know I got trodden all over and I don\u2019t want that to happen again. I have so much damn love to give, but I am so scared of letting anyone in that I am ruining relationships.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been in therapy and seen shrinks ever since I was raped, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be going anywhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what else to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr after experiencing some pretty bad abuse, physical, sexual, psychological and emotional from an ex girlfriend, and subtle psychological manipulation from the next, I struggle to find any services for me, and those that I do, make out like I'm supposed to be the abuser.

I am new here and would like to ask for and advice. My story is pretty complicated, but I will try to present it as shortly as posdible.\n\nAs a very sensitive person nowadays I struggle with anxiety and recovery of self-esteem due to misstrust of people and friends, who one after another reveal themselves as flying monkeys. There is one toxic friend, who we were close friends with for almost fifteen years (from teenage years up till late 20s). Our relationship was complicated and took a lot of energy and emotions from me due to his constant criticism, public shaming, blaming, etc. He loved to play with moral issues and would guilt-trip me every single time we met making me feel terrible inside and absolutely hated discussions about feelings or made me feel even worse due to being oversensitive. We developed a huge network of common friends (30 or so) with time mainly because that friend would have a new girlfriend every six months (not joking here) and some of their friends could join the group. The supposed friendship was very draining and I felt so triggered inside once that it was time to distance myself and shut down our relationship with him for good. Still, we have a lot of contacts in common, who either continue being friends with him, either hate him for various reasons. Some of these people are my friends, but I start to notice their relationship change towards me during the latest year we are in the phase of no direct contact with the toxic friend. Even the people I call the closest friends made me feel terrible due to very unexpected manipulations and guilt-trips. Some of them became emotionally unavailable, ignore me on purpose after not getting my usual nervous response after manipulation or are nice to me only when there is an economical interest.\nI have learned a lot about these kind of toxic relationships during the most recent years and became very protective of my emotions and well-being, yet cannot stop trusting at least a few of these so called friends and believing that maybe a few of them will not abuse me. It feels like being trapped in a circle and blocking of some of these friends on social media causes a reaction from other friends. They do not discuss any more serious topics with me anymore and it is almost certain that some nasty rumours are curculating. When strangers are being nice to me (I start to avoid meeting people from the very same group and slowly open up for new social interactions) it feels strange and almost fake. \nAs a highly sensitive person with tendencies for hipertension, sometimes I feel terribly exhausted both physically and mentally. However, not so long ago I was optimistic, curious, open-minded, carying, attentive, yet hurt inside. Now even lonely and unsure. My heart suggests me deleting all social media and  finding a new social circle, but brains ask for a vacation from relationships. :(", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u2019m 17 now, I was 16 when I met him and he was the same age as me.\n\nI have a prior history of being physically abused by my mother, which probably made me more vulnerable but abuse like this can happen to anyone.\n\nThis relationship is something I am so embarrassed I let happen to me and honestly I wish I had listened to those around me sooner. \n\nThe relationship only ended a few months ago and it only went on for around 8 months before I left. While the abuse never became physical, I believe if the relationship had lasted longer it eventually would have because he had physically abused his previous girlfriend after she moved in with him. (It\u2019s a long story as to why she moved in when they are both teenagers and she moved in with his family. I honestly don\u2019t even trust the account he gave me.)\n\nI met this boy (we\u2019ll call him W) through a mutual friend and we began talking. I will admit at the time I had been single for a while and desperately wanted to be in a relationship. I only really recognise this now and I believe W saw this and took full advantage of it. I was interested in him and he made it obvious he liked me and we started dating quite quickly. Things were great for the few weeks and I fell quite quickly. We talked often and spent most of our time playing video games together and sitting in discord calls together. He had slowly began to make me dependant on him through developing routines, I latch on to routines very quickly and become kind of hysterical when they\u2019re broken, this is something W took full advantage of.\n\nThe first red flag appeared after he had messaged me saying he was going to work and asked me what I would be doing while he was gone. This seemed a normal enough question so I told him I\u2019d most likely be watching Netflix. I ended up playing games with some old school friends of mine I hadn\u2019t spoken to in a long time. After learning I had been playing games with these friends W became enraged and accused me of lying to him. I wanted to diffuse the situation so I apologised and said I would tell him if I was going to again. \n\nThe second red flag was how possessive he was of me. He hated me talking to other men and would often accuse me of cheating on him with them even if I had only spoken to them once or twice. He would shut down if he ever saw me talking to them and he eventually later in the relationship made me stop talking to them all together.\n\nThe third red flag, also marked the beginning of the worsening of abuse, and was also the first time I attempted to end the relationship. I had wanted to buy event boxes with my own money for this video game I really enjoyed. W told me not to as he saw this as a waste of money. I know it wasn\u2019t the best thing to spend money on, but it was my money and I could do whatever I wanted with it. After he learned that I bought them anyway he exploded at me, saying that I never listened, I was dumb and stupid and said no wonder he hated me sometimes. After telling some of my friends about this, they encouraged me to leave the relationship. I did try. After I told him I was leaving, and that it wasn\u2019t acceptable for him to behave like this, and that I was leaving, he called me, crying, begging me not to leave, that he would change and if I ever left he\u2019d kill himself.\n\nSo I stayed. I believed he would change.\n\nObviously he didn\u2019t.\n\nThis cycle repeated at least two more times. After each attempt to leave the manipulation and control worsened. \n\nHe would make me feel crazy for even thinking of leaving him, that it was my fault he would get angry with me. He\u2019d take away routines to \u201cpunish me\u201d (his words) for not listening. He expected me to always be happy, and talk in a cutesy way. He forced me to stop swearing, stop talking to ANYONE without asking him first and would pressure me to send nude photos of myself, demanding more and more each time. The control reached a point where I literally couldn\u2019t do anything (Including going to the fucking bathroom) without asking him first. I was basically his pet.\n\nWhile this was happening, I became withdrawn and isolated from my friends and family. They would tell me how bad it was tor me but I believed he\u2019d change eventually I just needed to keep doing these things until he eventually trusted me enough to stop needing to control everything I did. \n\nI believed that I loved him. I thought he loved me.\n\nI would find myself crying uncontrollably at night telling myself it wasn\u2019t my fault. I felt lonely, and humiliated. I felt pathetic. \n\nI would reach out to his friends for help, some were apathetic, one normalised his behaviour and encouraged me to stay, only one ever genuinely tried to help me. I\u2019ll call him R. \n\nI reached out to R initially to be friends with him. I\u2019d reached a point in the abuse where I was basically broken. I was fearful of W but I accepted that everything was my fault and it was fine that this was happening because I deserved it.\n\nI ended up becoming very close with R. We would talk for hours on end and eventually I trusted him enough to tell him about everything W had done to me. When R learned of everything W had done he snapped. He told me this wasn\u2019t normal, that it was disgusting how W treated me and that I shouldn\u2019t stay. \n\nThe only reason I left was after realising that I didn\u2019t deserve what was happening to me, and how W didn\u2019t really love me.\n\nI ended up leaving, with R\u2019s support. The usual threats of suicide and self harm from W followed, but R and W\u2019s friends kept an eye on him to assure me that everything was truly ok and I didn\u2019t have to worry about him.\n\nI don\u2019t worry about him now. I feel nothing but disgust for W. I honestly never want anybody to go through what I did. And I do realise I didn\u2019t help myself enough, and I don\u2019t want anyone to ignore red flags like I did. I feel so much better letting all of this out.\n\nI want anyone who is in the same situation I was in or worse to know it\u2019s not your fault, it is never your fault, nothing excuses anyone of making you feel that way, and you are stronger than you know.

We knew each other for about six years. We were dating for some of that time. She ended things with a text and didn't explain why either. The night it happened, I was devastated. I tried to get a real conversation about this but nothing. The next day, I realized I felt emotionally abused by her. Two and a half years ago, I learned that she'd been cheating on me for over a year. I completely fell apart. My depression came back in force, and I ended up in a hospital a couple of months after that because I wanted to kill myself. Some time after this, she told me that she cut contact with the guy she cheated on me with. Then we started talking a little more often and it felt like our friendship was slowly healing. There were even some good days we had with each other. \n\nOther times, we argued because there were still issues. Since we first met, I was always there for her when she needed anything. Both of us had struggles with depression and experiences of abuse. Around when things started to look up, I asked her if she would do the same for me on a couple specific days that are always hard for me. She promised she would, but she wasn't. And she never apologized or even brought it up. When I tried to mention it, she made me feel guilty, saying that I make things a bigger issue than they really are and that I was a drama queen. During one of these conversations, it hurt so deeply I vomited and had a mental breakdown. I felt like I only existed when it was convenient for her. She had been letting me down with a lot of things, big and small, since a couple months before I knew she was cheating. Early and mid 2018, things seemed to be getting a lot better. It seemed like we would be a couple again, I really wanted that. Even after she broke my heart, I was still in love with her. \n\nThen late 2018, she told me she was going to move with her boyfriend to another state. That caught me off guard. Not long before that, I was her shoulder to cry on when her boyfriend did something that really badly hurt her. She said she was leaning towards breaking up with him. I was there for her no question, but I did secretly like to hear that. I thought maybe I'd get to have an honest chance with her. She also told me that she's had multiple partners she had sex with before. She led me to believe we were going to be each other's first. My heart sank. It was another hard time with each other but I still didn't think I'd lose her completely from my life. She was everything to me, even years before this both when we were and weren't together. We had a bad argument then started talking a bit more normally but still awkward, and that leads to now. She texted me Merry Christmas, then Happy New Year's, then that she didn't want to be friends anymore. Maybe I should have but I didn't see it coming. Some other bad things were happening at those times.\n\nI feel so lost. A few days after I got that message, I snapped. All the feelings I suppressed over the last two and a half years rushed to the surface. I'd endured so much of her disregarded me, lying, using me, letting me down, etc. And she said she didn't even feel guilty for some of it. All that time I never hesitated to be there for her, even when I was hurting because of her. My feelings keep going back and forth between hopeless and broken, sickeningly enraged, and empty and numb. The things I've recently been feeling are complicated. My racing thoughts will tell me it was her loss, she didn't deserve me. That she'd never find anyone half as loyal and supportive as I was for her. Then it'll turn around and say I've got nothing now. She made me the happiest I'd ever been and now she's gone. Like its switching between grieving and resenting her. I don't know what to do. I'm emotionally exhausted and scared. Sorry about the long post. I got caught up in all the mixed feelings.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

To be fair, I would not be surprised of my Nex *does* have BPD instead of or as well as NPD, and it isn't unusual for men with cluster B PDs to be misdiagnosed with Bi-Polar Disorder, however, a number of times in the past, I found myself suspecting that he was exaggerating and straight up making up shit.\n\nI know it sounds awful to say that you suspect someone is lying about being mentally ill, and I am still somewhat in disbelief at the possibility, but also have a large number of reasons for them:\n\n1. He has a very long past of lying to doctors to acquire medications to abuse, and I found out when I left him, had been doctor shopping during our relationship and had even stolen various medications from friends and family members.\n\n2. My ex was raised by a mother who used her BPD rages to gain control and keep everyone around her walking on eggshells and in control of the house, the people in it, ect. She also had an affair and moved in to her home a man with bi-polar disorder for a decade during my Nexs childhood and used both their mental illnesses, though mostly his manic symptoms to excuse the sexual affair they kept going. He learned a lot of manipulative behaviors/scams from his mother, maybe this was another one?\n\n2. He attempted to apply for disability payments from the government, which is not a red flag on it own, nor any thing to be ashamed of, however, when attending interviews, he dressed bizarrely, very much like a caricature, and from what I heard later behaved in a manner he thought convincingly crazy. The interviews were with a Psychologist who has an excellent reputation and is known for being very compassionate in her professional dealings with mentally ill people, but she advocated against him receiving financial payments, and with hindsight, *any* support whatsoever, beyond anger management classes. \n\n3. His \"episodes\" or 'breakdowns\" were at consistently convenient times, for him. Any time I pressured him to work, to go back to university, to help pack when we moved house, literally any tiny application of pressure for him to do anything beyond play video games all day and drink and party, were met with a week long disappearance than a reappearance in which he would come back from partying and having cheated/done serious drugs/blown money stolen from me, but it wasn't his fault because he was \"having a manic episode\" and was now \"*seriously depressed*\" - funny how his serious depression looked exactly the same as his normal state - and needed me to organize an admittance to psychiatric facility so he could \"rest\".\n\n4. His admissions to psychiatric facilities were very, very short. They would kick him out after a day or two - longest he ever stayed was a week. Now, unlike the underfunded, understaffed and overwhelmed public mental health system who are forced to discharge clients earlier than most would like, these were private facilities with no such problems, in fact, they were making a lot of money off him being there, yet several different places all gave him the boot quickly. Also they all refused to allow him ongoing out patient therapy, which is very rare. I have to wonder why.\n\n5. Oh, and whenever he was violent towards me he wasn't responsible because he conveniently was \"manic\" when it occurred, but stable when it ended. Even if it only lasted five minutes.\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I haven't shared the full of my story on here, but my last post describes the legal aspect of the issues dealing with my nex. Basically, my nex became extremely intoxicated one evening and damn near killed me by strangling me and slamming my head against a stone fireplace until I blacked out. I remember my last thought was who's going to take care of my dogs? I was surprised to wake up, to say the least. He was passed out on the floor next to me and I have no idea what made him let up. I sat by the front door the rest of the night stunned. I was far too injured to drive myself anywhere but I was prepared to run if he woke up at any point. When he woke up the next morning, he apologized and described it as a \"fugue state\". I missed work because I was basically a walking bruise with lumps and bumps all over my head. I finally reported him to the police and he was arrested, so on and so forth. I managed to get out because he and his mother unlawfully evicted me, rendering me homeless at the time. I thankfully have somewhere safe to live and I am grateful to be alive and my dogs aren't in danger any longer. \n\nMy issues are as such. He is currently grooming new supply. A friend warned me, not to gossip but out of genuine concern for the girl. She seems to think I need to let this girl know and provide pictures, recordings and copies of my restraining order and court paperwork as proof that he's incredibly dangerous. I have heard before that it's not wise to warn the new person because you'll just look like the crazy jealous ex. But this case might be different because I have actual proof and this woman has a child. I'm really torn. She could find out the hard way and I feel incredibly guilty if he hurts or kills her.

Then turns around and claims I'm downplaying his struggles and paints me as terrible. \n\nHe used to bully,pressure me into sex. Didn't realize it at the time but he'd scream and yell, accuse me of cheating until I finally caved (this usually happened when I'd go to bed, he'd come in just to argue for hours) it always bugged me that it never bugged him that I was distraught, crying, etc.\n\nHe claims I have no hobbies and never want to do anything because he does the same thing every weekend and I got tired of being dragged to these things surrounded by people I know he's bad mouthed me to.\nI'm not 'allowed' to have friends.

I take a lot home to my partner to vent and he's tired of it :( I'm sorry I'm posting this here I'm not sure what I wanted out of it I think I just needed to vent somewhere else and not feel judged or see if anyone has ever felt emotionally abused at work or in regard to something based on their personality traits?

{"post_id": "ahq304", "created_utc": 1547930871, "title": "PUA wannabe guru kicks me out of house/is he a narc? (long but worthwhile read)", "author": "orostman", "self_text": " \n\nSome background first; so, this story is about me and a guy (let's call him Perseus) who I've known for about two years. I met him through a mutual friend (no longer friends with that first friends), but became friends with Perseus and his room-mates. At the time I didn't have much of a social life (working weird hours, drifted apart from people) and these guys were really welcoming. I had no luck with dating lately and they were really enthusiastic about helping me with that. The guy called his group of friends a 'tribe' and hosted parties at their house, and then one night he invited me out to him meeting some friends at a library to attend a 'class' and Perseus told me on FB he wanted me to come. So I went and it was Perseus sitting at a table with some friends and reading some self-help book. I personally am not to into the self-help scene (I know this is a very diverse scene) but generally it was never my thing. I like seeking advice and stuff, and I'm all about improving myself in different ways, sure, but reading hundreds of pages -- no. I'd rather read something else, something on politics or some fiction.\n\nSo, I politely listened to him and tried to get into it a bit, was considering reading the book, but really just wasn't interested. After we went out for beer and had a good time. So, I ended up going to the classes sometimes but it was mostly to have a social life. I did kind of enjoy the academic environment a bit, but overall wasn't really impressed with the self-help book. To me it mostly sounded like generic advice I can get anywhere. Again, not my thing. So, I go to some of their parties, have a great time. One of them is good at giving me constructive criticism, which I honestly appreciated, and I was getting some bonding with Perseus and some other of the group. At one point when we were in a car one of the guys told me I should really come to the classes because they \"level up\" at each class. I tell him I am busy with work.\n\nAnyway, months go by, more parties, generally having a good time. I generally like the group, but a few things rub me the wrong way. Hard to explain (turns out one of them actually did have severe mental illness, but he left the house at a point), it was more the obsession that Perseus in particular had with self-help stuff; he had loads of books on it. The whole 'teaching a class' thing kind of weirded me out, and Perseus, who did have a University degree, instead of becoming an academic at an actual university would tell me plans of opening an online university himself to teach 'critical thinking', 'logic', and 'self-improvement'. One day I was visiting his house (the house was chill to hang out in because it was casual) and I was sitting in the living room and I heard him talking to someone on the phone saying something along the lines of \"oh, so-and-so is calling me a cult leader! Sure I'm a cult leader, but I'm an ethical cult leader, I would never get someone to drink poison!\"\n\nRed flags? Or am I over-reacting?\n\nTime goes on. I just brush off me hearing him say that; just figure he might've been semi-joking, or maybe he doesn't quite understand what cult means. Anyway, some more parties happen, generally cool. I help them move. He does things (Perseus) that kind of rub me the wrong way sometimes; like one time we were at a coffee shop and a good looking woman passes and he says to us other guys: \"Wow, look at her tits.\" And I'm like \"Okay\" and thing is, I'm not a prude or anything, I talk to friends about sex sometimes (when I have it) in some capacity; I just think that kind of talk is kinda trashy. I don't say anything because I have the feelings these guys (who are kind of bro- dude-like) will just tell me I'm overly PC or sensitive or something. If I see a nice looking woman pass by I might say \"wow, she's pretty\" to my buddy or something, sure, like, people do that. But really, he's just being vulgar and vulgarity is just one of my personal pet peeves, but I'm not going to ask him to change something like that for me right?\n\nSo, during this whole time, almost every time, he is pushing me to read The Mystery Method and other Pick Up Artist material (we're getting to the drama now). I talk to him, he gives me advice, some of his advice generally isn't bad advice. I go through life and with all the people I befriend I take whatever advice I can get to help in general. In the summer I read maybe 20% of The Mystery Method and I think it's mostly stupid. It's pretty much telling me to go into bars and go bug every woman - like, no. I don't want to do that. That's just creepy. So, I stop reading it. Later on, he continually pokes me to start reading these books again. One time, at a coffee shop he says pretty loud \"Dude, don't you want your dick in a mouth?\" This rubs me the wrong way, but I whatever it again. Okay, you all with me still? So here's the drama.\n\nOh, did I mention Perseus, almost every time I see him, is going on in front of the other tribe about his latest experience where he got a woman's attention in front of her boyfriend (the alpha) or one time when he danced with a woman (but didn't have sex with her because he timed the order in which he did things wrong). This really weirded me out.\n\nWe start having hang-outs where we'd chill, play some games, maybe cards, have a few beers, smoke something. I like these. So I go to one and its just a few of us. Half the people there (tribe) are in the kitchen cooking and it's just me, Perseus, and another guy who is new (young impressionable guy who likes Jordan Peterson). So, at one point I tell Perseus what's going on in my dating life. Although at the time I wasn't dating anyone, I had two prospects (one was long-distance and we were meaning to meet up but she flakes, and another woman I just started talking online, but we haven't met yet and only started but things were looking good generally). So I told him about this great new woman I was talking to. So Perseus starts going on about how I never 'seal the deal' (there's truth to that, sure). So I was hoping I could tell him more about this woman. Instead he reaches to his bookshelf and puts a PUA book in front of me, the one I started reading and quit. He tells me, for the dozenth time that this is the key. So here it starts;\n\nI don't recall exactly everything that led to it getting more heated but I remember telling him I wasn't into the whole PUA self-help scene. He then reminded me that I was having no luck lately with women. I told him this is true, but told him things were generally getting better and that I was working on it. He then reminded me that I am not having luck and that this will help me. I bring up something along the lines of a lot of the self-help stuff being based around evolutionary psychology - which, while a legit field, is something I personally don't really trust. I feel that, and many critics do, much of evolutionary psychology is based on speculation. Or there are books written, I've found, that will support an agenda and use evolutionary psychology but will cherry pick facts to suit their agenda. He gets defensive about that not being true. Both of are voices are raised a bit by this point, but I feel he is being aggressive with me now. He asks me quickly: \"Do you believe in evolution? (yes) Do you believe in psychology? (Yes) Then how can you say that evolutionary psychology isn't a legit field. He then brings up that many people in some fields don't like people in other fields; which is true sure. So, this goes back and forth.\n\nI tell him I feel he's pushing his beliefs on me. He asks me what 'pushing' means, asking me to define what I mean by 'pushing'. I tell him I'm not into self-help scene; what's wrong with helping oneself? Everyone wants to help themself! He also tells me I am pushing my views on him and the others by not listening to what he has to say. He tells me I am being irritating because I was asking for dating advice and now am refusing to listen when he's giving it. (I wanted friendly advice sure, not a book I have to read), so basically I need to read this book or I will never kiss a woman again &lt;-- he doesn't say that, but he seems to be implying it. Like, he never once asked me about this woman I am speaking with (her background, interests, what we talk about) to give me advice; he just gives me this book to read. I tell him I am not really interested in the general self help scene, he insists it's a diverse scene and you can't judge it (which is true, sure), but, since he's pushing me I tell him what I really think \"Honestly, I don't respect the whole self-help industry, I think most of them are scammers.\"\n\nThis seems to trigger him. \"I'm taking that personally because you just insulted my profession. I have been writing a self-help book for years!\" I didn't know this and I tell him I didn't know this. The genie's out of the bottle. He tells me I haven't even read any of these books yet I judge them (I tried and it sucked). He continues to get aggressive. I tell him he's getting aggressive; he says \"No, you sound aggressive to me!\"\n\nHe tells me he read all my short stories (I am a fiction writer) and was all upset that I never once went to his website! I didn't know he had one; and I'm not interested so what? I asked him straight up \"So to hang out with you I need to go to your website?\" Don't remember what he said. He keeps pressing me on why I wont read these books. I tell him I wont read them and he has to accept that. He keeps pressing me. I tell him straight up I think many of those books are misogynist. He then says \"Are you calling me a misogynist? Do you think my girlfriend thinks I am a misogynist? Misogyny means hatred of women, do you understand that? I don't hate women!\"\n\nSo I'm mentally out the door now. He keeps telling me I'm being unreasonable. I tell him I feel really freaked out right now and feel like he's being aggressive with me, and I get a bit angry at this point. He keeps arguing at me, telling me I don't listen to him. I go to the fridge, grab the beers I brought. I leave the wrapping in the fridge because I am in a rush to get out. Perseus demands I not leave garbage in the fridge. I take it out. I start heading towards the door and tell him to stop using rhetoical manipulative techniques on me. I tell him, what I always thought, that his classes were creepy. He slams the door in my face.\n\nI take my beers (btw, we both only had one drink at this point so it's not the alcohol). I text him while I am waiting for a cab and tell him \"Dude, that was not cool. I've never seen anyone act like that before. You were poking me. Dude, not all your friends are going to want this self help stuff! If they tell you they dont want it leave them alone!\"\n\nHe texts me after a minute and says \"you sound upset. Maybe take some space to reflect.\"\n\nLater on he texts again and says \"We had a communication issue. I am sorry u perceived me as being aggressive. Hopefully we can get along better next time.\"\n\nI tell him \"No, not cool. We're done. You seriously freaked me out. Don't try to gaslight me. Good-bye.\"\n\nI go home and don't get to sleep. WHAT THE...am I over-reacting? Obviously the way I wrote this it's biased, but I am telling you everything is true as best I can remember. I have been through a lot of manipulation lately by people in my life and people acting strangely to me and telling me I'm at fault. Was I the asshole?\n\nTL:DR - guy kicks me out of his house for telling him honestly I don't like 'self-help' books and he seems cultish. Also, he dates a woman so he can't be a misogynist and he claims to be a critical thinker.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I feel stupid everyday in the last one year. And I think I finally have the courage to accept I was fooled. What I am still scared about is allowing people to walk over me like this in the future too, so here I am.\n\nHere's my story starting:\n\nIt was 2017 and I had recently broken up with a girl I'd been on and off for the last one year.\nI ran into this tall, pretty blonde, who was so pretty I drooled for minutes just looking at her the first time.\nShe chased me like there was no end. Whatsapp, Facebook, Snapchat, Messenger, Skype, Messages, she was everywhere.\nI'll just say we spent three months, where 50% of the time she'd be with me and the rest 50% of the time she'd be texting/video calling me.\nI was slowly falling for her.\nShe kept doing things for me no one else earlier had. \nI was going on an international vacation for 25 days. She made food for my flight, gifted me my favorite magazine and gave me stuff I could use on my vacation. She gave me a card which  explained how much she like me and would be waiting for me when I come back. \nWhile on my vacation, she cried on a video call as to how much she missed me. She would ask me if I was partying. She would be all possessive and tell me she felt clingy. She would also say this periodically \" I am so lucky to have you and I never want to lose you\".\nMy Instagram would keep buzzing with her messages and tags online.\nI became addicted to her.\nI opened my heart up to her.\nShe said \"I love you\". I told her I loved her too.\nI told her she became my life.\n\nNow on to the next three months.\n\nI thought I'd found the one. I was madly in love now too. It was like \"now I know after years of dating other women\", what love actually feels like. I was crazy happy.\n\nWe became gf and bf and she opened up to me as to how she struggles with depression. Everytime she'd dissappear for a bit or do something I would otherwise confront, she'd blame it on her depression. I'd just turn a blind eye to it.\n\nNow this is month seven and out of the blue, everything's changed overnight. Nothing I do can go right, she's not willing to talk about things. This continues for 10 days.\n\nShe starts refusing sex. She starts refusing to talk about important  things. One such night, the first time I tell her I don't know why she's been acting like this(I'd become a mouse because of how much I cared for her and thought she'd been weird because of her depression), she leaves my house.\n\nNext day I'm told we're broken up. She refuses to talk about it. \n\nShe blocks me on all social media. She blocks all my friends.\n\nShe starts posting online, but I can't see because it's all private.\n\nHere are my next 15 days:\n\nI spend my days crying, not knowing what happened, I can't sleep all night. I grow these huge black circles.\n\nI don't know how she is, if she is depressed, if she is fine and I spend my entire day wondering.\n\nI message her. She doesn't reply. I ask her to just talk to me once. No reply.\n\nI email her. No reply.\n\nI tell her I still love her and am sorry for reacting that day. No reply.\n\nI email her, I don't know why she's doing this to me after all the love we shared and spent our time together. No reply.\n\nI make a video and express whatever I had to say and add it to our online photos album. She doesn't view it.\n\nShe deletes all our pictures. No reply.\n\nI become an alcoholic. I cry by  myself every time. \n\nI am shocked as to how someone who couldn't live one second without me has suddenly cut me off, without a second thought.\n\nAnd boom.\n\nI check her exes Instagram. He was in the city, at the bar right next to her house the week we broke up.\n\nI decided I'm not going to contact her again. But............\n\nMy broken heart needed some answers. My dark circled eyes needed a peaceful sleep. My brain needed some logics. Why, when and how did all of this happen?  How can she do this to me? Was this all a fallacy? Did I mean nothing? Have I been fooled?\n\nShe's come back twice after that, both times telling me \" I love you\".\n\nThe first time she threatened to call the police on me for a false accusation, when I told her I wasn't going to take her to my holiday party. She ghosted me after that.\n\nThe second time, she apologised for what she had done the previous time and how she was depressed when we were breaking up with first time. Twelve days later, she ghosted me again, when I called her out on her \"taking me for granted\" behavior.\n\nAll this time she'd been triangulating me with her ex.\n\nOne day she wouldn't reply to my texts. Next day I'd have 15 likes on my Instagram.\n\nI finally broke my silence after this.\n\nI sent her a big email, exposing all her lies and how I saw through them and I hope I never meet a girl like her again. She obviously blocked me everywhere after that and never talked about things.\n\nI wanted to say more. I wanted to shout more. I was helpless.\n\nNext: I started to look for answers online. I've spent four months going through Quora and YouTube. It's scary how many people have had the same exact experience.\n\nEverything that happened pointed to covert NPD.\n\nI was silenced everytime she wronged me.\n\nI was treated like a nobody every time I'd call her out.\n\nShe tried to get my friends on her side. She tried to hurt me the maximum she could.\n\nI was not allowed to say a word everytime.\n\nShe tried to date a guy I work with recently, when there are like 1000s of other guys she could go for in this big city.\n\nShe tried to date one of my friends, when she had be blocked recently.\n\nI am sure of how I am the bad guy in each of her friends and family's eyes.\n\nShe's followed like 200 guys since our breakup. \n\nEveryone's got a great job.\n\nEveryone's got the same profile as me.\n\nEveryone's getting fooled the same way.\n\nShe's still the caring, lovely, jovial girl in everyone's eyes.\n\nI am like I never existed in her life.\n\nWhy do I write now?\n\nShe's recently made all her profiles public and I can see she's repeating the same cycle with other people.\n\nI sense a hoover coming. Only this time I know the girl I dated was an illusion, so I am not going to be fooled again.\n\nWhy do I know her profile's public? Today's a Saturday and I have not gotten past how I was used and thrown like I am a nobody.\n\nI have learned a lot from this experience and won't allow this to happen again.\n\nI've been on 10 dates since, but I don't think I'm ready.\n\nI've focussed on my career and what I like to do ever since.\n\nI've started loving my life again.\n\nI don't know if I am strong enough to handle the mental abuse again, but I know I just have to avoid it somehow till I am 100% over it.\n\nHave a good day.

The assault happened right before Halloween and is what made me see how bad things were and that they needed to stop.\n\nSince then, my brain has kind of....done its best to  lock those memories up and just not deal with them. I don't remember certain things because it was so traumatic I dissociated, or I do remember them but just dont think about it because my brain just...doesn't want to deal with it, I guess.\n\nI tried EMDR about two years ago for the childhood abuse and didn't love it (probably the therapist's fault, not because the therapy itself was bad)....I'm in CBT/talk therapy now for PTSD, plus OCD and anxiety and depression (all of which I had before the assault). The assault also somehow made me start dealing with feelings I'd repressed for years regarding my sexuality, so now we're talking about that in therapy (I'm bi).\n\nSo all that to say...I feel like a lot of my memories are somatic, if that makes sense. Being touched by my ex would trigger memories of my best friend...memories I hadn't remembered beforehand. I tried touching myself once when I was with him to see if it had the same affect, and it did. Now that he's gone and I feel safer, not so much.\n\nI feel like talking and maybe EMDR would be good, but I'm also curious about somatic experience therapy (I believe that's what it's called).

I have ZERO desire to have a relationship or be intimate with anyone currently, but I do feel like exploring my own body and what feels good for myself could actually be healing.

I\u2019m not isolated from family and if anything I control most of what happens day to day in out relationship.

I should walk away and not engage during a rage as it has never ended well but then I feel like I\u2019m being a doormat. There has never been any physical abuse. But we just had an incident that shook me and took his rage to level I\u2019ve never seen before and I have to wonder if I accept this how far can his behaviour escalate? Brief overview: \n\n\u00b7 Rage triggered by two recent small rejections by me of his sexual advances \n\n\u00b7 An argument proceeds about who has tired harder to spark our sex like \n\n\u00b7 My point is that my small need of kissing to initiate sex everynow again has been neglected (we kiss during sex, but a passionate kiss outside the bedroom doesn\u2019t happen) \n\n\u00b7 He continues with it being about his needs and how I\u2019m not this and that. \n\n\u00b7 He\u2019s arguing in a circular fashion, telling me failed as partner etc, always ignoring my question and kissing and recently lets just say I fulfilled his needs. \n\n\u00b7 He draws a line down a piece of paper and writes his needs on one side and asks me to  the same \n\n\u00b7 I write kissing \u2013 that\u2019s it, my one simple need. \n\n\u00b7 He says, \u2018I like kissing, what are you trying to say I don\u2019t like kissing? Want me to write down a list of all the girls I like kissing? Here I\u2019ll write a list\u2026maybe I don\u2019t like kissing you\u201d \n\n\u00b7 There is a history of affairs and one recently, so a comment about liking to kiss other girls just not me and I see red. I look at him shocked that he\u2019d go so low and I can see on his face confusion and I realised the comment wasn\u2019t actually to hurt me \u2013 he just  thought it\u2019d win the argument by showing me \u2018kissing\u2019 is not some fundamental flaw with him but with me \n\n\u00b7 Seeing red - I slammed the door as I left, some keys got stuck and it wasn\u2019t as satisfying as I\u2019d expected, and without thinking I picked up an empty pot and smashed it on the concrete (that\u2019s a first me). \n\n\u00b7 I left sat and sat in the car crying and he called, and told me to clean to pot up as our dog would get stuff in his paws. I thought fair enough, I did smash the pot and went back to clean it up. As I\u2019m cleaning it up I don\u2019t really notice anything is a miss. I\u2019m just crying and picking up the pot and N say\u2019s \u201cand you can clean up the backyard too\u201d When I go in the backyard he has smashed my tomato plants that he knows I\u2019m super proud of growing muttering about how I don\u2019t respect the property and he pay for everything (sidenote minimal damage to the door and pot was old and I\u2019m not proud of my behaviour). As I breakdown because someone I loved smashed something that meant something too me, I see a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes that I\u2019ve never seen before. \n\n\u00b7 His also smash the pots my herbs are in \n\n\u00b7 N tells me to clean it all up. I say \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t smash those pots, you did you clean it up and leave\u201d\n\n\u00b7 He calls me and demands I clean up the plants or all my stuff in the study will end up in the front yard \u2013 smashed. My laptop and study materials is what he is referring to.  I really wanted to say no, but deep down I didn\u2019t trust that he wouldn\u2019t ruin my laptop and while I knew when the storm past he\u2019d feel shitty about it, I need my laptop for work. \n\n\u00b7 I reluctantly go back, I\u2019m scared and I\u2019m angry but cleaning the mess is better than my stuff being ruined \u2013 I feel powerless and that was the most difficult thing for me. In all our arguments I\u2019ve never felt powerless, intimated or threatened.  \n\n\u00b7 If I accept this behaviour and he now knows I will, what is next? \n\nI\u2019m at my Mum\u2019s now and I just need space and to rant.

Back in October I decided to move into my mom's second house. my lease was up and I felt like this was a super awesome chance in getting to know her in our different stages in life, not like a money thing if that makes any sense. So two weeks before Christmas she gets upset and goes to her other house. We skip going for Christmas. She comes home January 5, ignores me for two days; meanwhile doing her weird passive aggressive shit (shutting doors loudly, etc). I'm terrified to run into her, so my kids and I leave as much as possible and avoid using anything expect our rooms and bathroom, we also eat out a lot to avoid the kitchen. By this point I'm looking for a new rental house desperately. January 7th, she decides she wants to talk to me and tries to force me to talk. She finds me in the bathroom trying to get ready to leave, I explain firmly but respectfully that I don't want to talk, we can later. She tries to push the door open. I go to my room and have to listen to her insults of me not being a woman. I try to close my door and she pushes it open. Long story short kids and I try to leave, I tell her we are moving out and she spits and scratches my face. I didn't say anything and walked to my car. She gets behind it and starts yelling to not run her over. She calls my dad and tells him to call 911 but he lives in Arizona for work. We go to a hotel until an awesome house falls into my lap. \n\nSo here's a small back story. My mother was married before the marriage to my dad. She said first husband was abusive. He was her ticket out of Korea I think. She had two kids (S &amp; J), got a divorce, met my dad, they married a month before I was born. My little brother was born 6 years after me. \n\nAncestryDNA confirmed that I am my mother's first husband. I grew up knowing another man as my father and for some weird reason my brain cannot comprehend this. Guys why can't I understand this???\n\nSo my biological father died in February 2018. My half sister and half brother are really my full siblings. My little brother is actually my half brother. To complicate it all, I can't/don't want to talk to them because of this Christmas fight. My mother lied and manipulated my dad and brother to think I had punched her, trespassed, then burglarized her house. Two times the police told her I legally still live there and she cannot kick us out. We needed them there for our safety. I mean, you can't trespass or burglarize if you live there, am I right?!\n\nI literally have to keep asking myself if I'm awake because this feels like a dream. Should I get medical help?

I am married to her son and he was most definitely her golden boy (she literally says her son is her gold and her daughters are her silver). Are narcissists likely to produce narcissists? I think my husband feels empathy so it\u2019s hard to tell. For awhile i thought he was a codependent like me, but I\u2019ve been noticing more as I research narcissists more. \n\nHe is an expert at gaslighting. Here\u2019s an example. This morning, I got off my 12 hour graveyard shift, came home and fed our 7 month old (I am still breastfeeding), fed our 2 older kids breakfast, and started to get myself ready for bed. While I was in the bedroom entertaining the baby and simultaneously changing into my pajamas, he called out to me that he needed my help with his schoolwork. He was having difficulty pulling up websites on our new Mac (he is technologically challenged...or stubborn). I showed him again how to do that and he kept snapping at me. He was trying to find the answer to a question on his homework using google and he insisted I was doing something wrong and that I needed to talk to his coworker who had told him exactly what to do to find the answers to these specific questions. I said I understood what his coworker was saying to do, it just wasn\u2019t producing the result he wanted. He became more frustrated with me, and I could tell he was stressed out, so I said, \u201choney this doesn\u2019t have to be done today, why don\u2019t you take a break.\u201d He immediately snapped that I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about and that i \u201calways\u201d do this. I said \u201cActually I know it\u2019s not due until mid-February so what do you mean?\u201d And he repeated that I always think I know things when i don\u2019t know everything and that I should \u201cjust go to bed.\u201d \n\nI was happy to just go to bed and not be talked to like that. But I\u2019ve been working a lot on myself and on boundaries and standing up for myself, so I couldn\u2019t just let it go. That afternoon when i got up, I decided to talk to him about it. I told him I didn\u2019t appreciate being talked to like that this morning and that he snapped at when I was trying to help him at his request for help. He proceeded to snap at me again that I \u201calways\u201d assume things that I don\u2019t know anything about, such as telling him he likes the color black when he says he doesn\u2019t (no idea what he\u2019s talking about). I said I was just trying to de escalate his stress by reminding him it doesn\u2019t have to be done right now and it can wait until I have time off work and can help him more. His voice got louder and he said there aren\u2019t any days between now and when it\u2019s due that he can do the homework because tomorrow is football and he\u2019s going to have to work all the other days off because \u201cyou haven\u2019t saved for Disneyland right? Have you? I\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t! I\u2019m going to have to work all those days to pay for the Disneyland trip!\u201d I replied that no i haven\u2019t saved for Disneyland yet and he said \u201csee?!\u201d (Totally turning it into a different fight where he is better at saving money than me) I said \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you just explain that this morning when I asked why it has to be done today?\u201d And he just stared at the tv and refused to talk to me until later when he needed to know where the scissors were.\n\nIn the past, he\u2019s had a drinking problem and he would have days where he was very happy while drinking, until later in the night when he would get very, very mean. But there was always that happy zone. He quit drinking 3 weeks ago at my request (he accidentally hurt our daughter when he stumbled on her, then almost hurt the baby later in the night, and that was it for me, i finally put my foot down) but now it\u2019s just all darkness, no happy moments. He also withholds sex from me when he\u2019s mad at me. It\u2019s been about 2 months. I even setup a date night that he didn\u2019t want to go on, then I got my mom to take our daughters for a few hours and I suggested sex and he turned me down and went to bed at 7pm.\n\nI know this is just a snippet of our life but I feel like I need to figure out if he\u2019s a narcissist in order to know how to proceed toward a happier life.

(She said she liked one belt in particular cause it had little stones and decorations on it and it hurt a lot). I always tried to speak up for myself even when I was young, I told her that I learned in school that hitting your children is illegal in Germany but she said that she doesn't care because she isn't German and in her culture it's okay to hit children. My dad would often hit is too.\n\nShe stopped hitting me when I turned about 11 cause I had a teacher that kind of jokingly mentioned how her mom would hit her with a wooden spoon when she was naughty so i'm like \"my mom does that too\" obviously my teachers got super worried after that and they were always asking if everything was okay at home and stuff. I think they ended up talking to my mom which is probably the reason she stopped with that. \n\nWell she continued to emotionally abuse us tho until today. At every minor mistake or inconvenience she calls us stupid and retarded and that we have no emotional intelligence (idk what exactly that is either lol).

She even does that to my dad so basically my mom is a tyrant over the entire family lol. \n\nI know it's not nearly as bad as other cases of abuse I just needed to let this out because the way she treated me has had lasting effects on me.

Prior to last year, I\u2019d always been aware of the term \u201cnarcissist\u201d but, like many others, believed it to mean just an elevated arrogance or basic lack of empathy. I\u2019d definitely dated men with narcissistic qualities and, when I was younger, probably displayed a few of those qualities myself. But last year I got a crash course in loving(?) what I now believe to be a true covert NPD. Reading this sub (and stuff in Quora and Psych. Today) helped me to see what was happening and to withdraw. It wasn\u2019t easy and I had to keep reading (and still do) to remind me what everything he did (and does) actually represents. I still have a ton of work to do on myself, but again, thank you all for helping me stay sane and make better decisions.\n\nI\u2019m posting today to help anyone who is struggling with no contact. I\u2019m inclined to do it because my NEX reached out on Messenger yesterday and what happened was textbook. The lead up: we officially \u201cbroke up\u201d for the last time in Sept. and our last discussion was by text in early Dec. I was worried about his health (serious heart problems) and had reached out to see if he was alright (my bad). He came unglued on me for contacting him, so I\u2019m assuming he had another fuel source and I was nothing but a huge annoyance to him. I backed off immediately and sincerely apologized for making contact, but he kept coming. He was unreasonably and obscenely cruel and nothing I said could make it stop. Finally, I unloaded on him like I never had. I said all the things I knew would sting him the worst (and it still wasn\u2019t nearly as bad as the things he\u2019d said to me). Even though I was a little disgusted with myself, it felt good. He blocked me mid-rant (they can dish it out, but never take it) and that was that. \n\nI\u2019d read about revenge from narcissistic injury, so it was half expected when he left a package that said, \u201cMerry Christmas J- - - \u201c next to my mailbox on Christmas Eve night. He would be overjoyed to know that my ex-husband found it and delivered it to the house when he was coming to get the kids. Thank God he didn\u2019t open it and, moreso, that my kids didn\u2019t find it, since it was full of sex toys and lingerie that we\u2019d shared during our time together. He knew damn well it could have been found by anyone.\n\nI knew that this was not only revenge, but fishing, so I didn\u2019t bite. I figured that now that he\u2019d gotten it out of his system, it would be over. I\u2019d heard through the grapevine he\u2019d been going through some things - triple bypass surgery for one. In the past, he\u2019d always run to me for sympathy when he was sick or in pain. Off topic, but most everything that\u2019s wrong with him is self-induced - smokes over 2 packs a day, drinks too much, little to no exercise, and a general pessimistic life attitude. Yes, I know how to pick \u2018em. :) But even the most timid mention of his own contributions to his health would lead to complete denial, nasty comebacks and the silent treatment (usually all three). Anyway, I was sure if I didn\u2019t hear from him about his surgery, he must definitely have someone new to comfort him. What I forgot was that doesn\u2019t matter. They don\u2019t mind having more than one fuel source. \n\nSo yesterday - he unblocked Messenger and started talking about his surgery at about 7:30pm. I didn\u2019t answer (I used to always answer), so he went on steadily for the next 6 or 7 hours - literally hundreds of messages. I didn\u2019t block for these reasons, right or wrong: 1. Morbid curiosity. 2. A small feeling of triumph. 3. I still miss who I imagined he was (but not bad enough to sacrifice myself). 4. I want warning if he\u2019s thinking of coming to my house unannounced. Anyway, I let it go on until about 2am. I could tell he was getting very drunk and he said that if I would just tell him I didn\u2019t want him any more, he\u2019d stop. I messaged, \u201cI don\u2019t want you.\u201d Of course, he didn\u2019t stop there - he went on well into today, even though I only ever responded one time. \n\nThe part that might be of use to anyone struggling is the way in which he continually switched tack to get me to respond. During the course of his diatribe, he did all these things:\n\n1. Acted like nothing ever happened between us and expounded upon his health like we were just old friends.\n2. Told me I didn\u2019t care about him and never did.\n3. Professed his love for me.\n4. Made romantic advances. \n5. Made sexual advances.\n6. Made crude, disgusting sexual advances.\n7. Told me I was a bitch and worse.\n8. Threatened suicide\n9. Told me he had never hurt me, but that I'd hurt him terribly.\n10. Begged me to talk to him.\n11. Told me I could move into his house. (????)\n12. Begged me to come there.\n13. Begged me to let him come here.\n14. Sent a picture of himself lying in the hospital with his freshly sutured chest.\n\nIt was really incredible and eye-opening. I could see he had only one goal - to elicit a reaction. It didn\u2019t matter whether he wooed me, scared me, fooled me, lied to me, angered me, turned me on, made me hurt for him, etc. It wasn\u2019t about me - not one bit. All he wanted was for me to bite and it didn\u2019t matter how. He just needed the fuel.\n\nAll the things he\u2019s said over the last two days are nothing new - I just finally saw how gross it was because this is the first time I wasn\u2019t busy trying to reason with him.  This time, I just kept my mouth shut and let him rant. And now it\u2019s finally dawned on me: all those other times I\u2019d been under the illusion that I was part of an exchange - that he was reacting to the things I was saying.  This time, I removed myself and he still said all the same shit in basically the same order. News flash: I WAS NEVER PART OF THE CONVERSATION. He\u2019s been talking to himself the whole time, every second of our relationship. I was nothing but a placeholder, an extra in his big production.\n\nIt all got boring, so I sent him links to a couple of blogs about how to know you\u2019re in a relationship with a narcissist. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not familiar with the term and even more sure he didn\u2019t read them, but it was enough for him to see my gist and become disgusted. One key thing he said to me when we were breaking up, \u201cI used to have respect for you. Now you don\u2019t even respect yourself.\u201d And he was right. So he viewed these links as yet another ploy of mine to get sympathy from him. Truly, there was a time I did want (need) some sympathy from him. And though I lavished him the with attention and sympathy he craved when we were together, I never got a drop (during devalue). Even though the great bulk of his messages to me were to elicit sympathy, the thought of protecting or comforting me seemed to make him nauseous (except for the 2 months of love-bombing, when he was Prince Charming).\n\nUpshot: this response was enough to get him to disappear. His last message was: \u201cThought I wanted to know you again, not feel sorry for you.\u201d How\u2019s that for zero self-awareness? \n\nThe hardest things for me about having loved a narc? Feeling sorry for that extremely damaged little kid you know is living in there, anger at the parent/circumstance that mangled them so irredeemably, having to get over losing someone that loved you so perfectly for such a short time (and never really existed), pulling out all the stops (and compromising both dignity and common sense) just to keep them for another day, loathing yourself when you see yourself how they really see you, then loathing yourself for finding it hard to walk away. Yeah, I guess it sucks across the board.\n\nI know that many of you have lost years to a narcissist and I consider myself very lucky my experience was relatively short. I understand that there are whole levels of hell I never had to experience. I wish any of you who are still enmeshed or just having a hard time getting over Godspeed. Never forgot there are so many of us in your corner.\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I've been in therapy for 10 years but recently took on some more help because I am not getting stable. Now seeing my main org once a week, a group therapy at a CSA non-profit, and a new EMDR therapist. The new therapist is a specialist in those with DID disorders. She confirmed everything I have been thinking for years, and I'm now accepting the reality that the guides in my head are actual fragments of my own mind. We haven't even started the EMDR exercises yet because I'm trying to process it all.\n\nI'm almost 29 and there are some days I go back to my core at 9-10 years old, reliving the emotional trauma again and again and again. I started my own personal journey by building my timeline of individual traumatic moments I experienced in my life. I'm at about 20 individual moments right now, more probably to come as I start to go down this path.\n\nNow that I'm realizing this is what it is, I'm slowly trying to teach myself how to let down the walls that I built to keep everyone in my mind suppressed in the first place.

I'm discovering new guides in my head, and learning about memories I hid long ago.\n\nI can't properly put into words what the pain is like when the dissociative moments start. I am one step away from this disorder, full blown. I have yet to alter physically and while I am proud of that, I cannot hold what I once was for too much longer. I'm going to alter whether I consent or not as this progresses, and I need to figure out how to comprehend what the fuck is going on in my head before I lose control completely.\n\nCan anyone out there who has what I have explain a bit of your experience of discovering this disorder? I'm looking for info like:\n\n1. How many alters you have?\n2.  Did they come all at once, or one at a time?\n3. When you dissociate or alter, do you experience 'pain'? How do you describe it?\n4. Have they ever asked for your consent to alter. If so, how did you let them? Do you lose consciousness?\n\nI'm sorry for all the questions and I know it's going to be different for each person. I just need someone to tell me I'm not alone, that this is real, and that I am going to get through this. I can't explain how scared I am posting this but I need this help now more than ever.\n\nI know my next step here is to alter, and I need to find a way to do it that won't kill me.\n\nI'm not going to apologize if I sound crazy because I literally dgaf anymore.

You don't believe in a\u00a0 responsibility to a universe outside of yourself. What you need is a higher power, but you mistakenly believe you ARE the higher power.\n\nI remember when I first met you. You were a mini version of your dad, wearing his band T-shirts and listening to the music of his youth. Then you became a clone of your best friend, copying his interests, his outfits, even his mannerisms. In college you started idolizing another classmate, and you still stalk his life on Facebook ten years later. Before I fully understood the real reason for your obsession, I thought you were literally in love with him. In a way, you WERE in love, or as close to feeling \"love\" as a narcissist can get. Really, though, you just coveted his charisma, his unearned lifestyle, and his banging hot wife... all of the things you lack. Things you feel entitled to own without doing a damn thing to build your character and actually deserve them.\n\nWeren't you just so jealous of your preppy rich cousins growing up? Mirroring your father again, but one generation removed. He was jealous of his in-laws and felt slighted by the universe, so he figured he was somehow entitled to mooch off them forever to punish them for his own misfortunes and bad choices after your mom got sick. Your family lived in a series of disheveled apartments and dilapidated shacks, constantly begging to aunts and uncles to foot the bill for basic needs after squandering on booze and frivolous purchases. \n\nBut you managed to get out and put yourself though college on loans. I was so proud of you. You had a chance to break the cycle, and you were brave enough to do the work. Your cousins, meanwhile, lived in extravagant houses given to them by their parents and went to college debt free. Instead of letting it go and simply appreciating what you had fought for, all you could think about was, \"How dare they have it easier than I did?\" \n\nYou absorbed all those personalities along with their worst flaws, like a sponge absorbing poison. You're a narcissist like your father, both of you with arrested development. Like selfish, angry children, emotionally stunted and shockingly low on empathy. Sending your dysfunction back out into the world with coldness, resentment, entitlement and a hateful lack of self awareness. Victimized, and using it as a lame excuse to choose to abuse others. \n\nI pity you, and I mourn for the man you might have become.

A friend of mine has always had a rough life but all that seemed to change when he met his then girlfriend now ex wife at the time. I don't know all the details but apparently he went through every sort of abuse imaginable. He's in his early 20s and already tens of thousands in debt due to his ex and her mom doing things like using his car on the toll road without asking or telling him. They kept a lot of his personal belongings after throwing him to the streets where he was stuck sleeping outside, and moved away as soon as they kicked him out and have been making it so he no longer can see his infant son. She accused him of the very same abuse she inflicted on him and won full custody with no evidence but a lot of friends that rallied to her side and didn't actually see him do anything and she had no evidence for, just flocked to her side because of her abuse story she made up while my friend was out in the street unable to get home.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen pictures and videos and recordings of what his ex wife has done to him, it was anything from verbal to physical abuse. She's even attacked him with a knife. He would sometimes visit his family when she allowed him to see them and he would be covered in bruises or cuts but always passed it off as his job even when he didn't have a job. He's pretty sure she planned everything to end up this way because as far as he and I are aware he has only ever been drunk once in his life. This was when she was egging him on to drink a lot to celebrate a birthday. He doesn't remember the night very well but not too long after she became pregnant. She would constantly ask for forgiveness and promise to change after beating him or berating him harshly, or blame it on some mental illness she had that he didn't know about until then and there. Despite the way she treated him whenever we talked he would always talk about her and ask or talk about ideas how he could make her happy or improve her life in general, he wouldn't talk to me about the abuse though except a handful of times and would severely downplay it and blame himself because he \"wasn't caring enough\" or \"he wasn't taking care of her the way she needed.\"  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn one day he lost his son, his family, a lot of his personal belongings that meant a lot to him and nearly every single friend of his except me and two others and she has branded him as a wife beater and drug abuser when I have known him for a lot longer than she has and he is very far from any of those things.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last time we spoke was in the summer of last year. He missed his sons very first birthday, and said he doesn't have anymore tears to shed and doesn't know why he bothers doing anything in life anymore. Nobody listened to him that could help and everyone dissuaded every piece of evidence he has, even though some are documented police visits and direct statements from his ex wife's own father and sister. He sent me a channel he made with a couple of the voice recordings and a small handful of photos here:   \n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXGgEKRbWsP-BfQe7ZxBrqA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXGgEKRbWsP-BfQe7ZxBrqA) (trigger warning, lots of anger and yelling)  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd hasn't been online or seen since. He is alive still it seems, but he hasn't spoken to me or his other two friends in almost a half a year and as far as we have been told or know, he refuses to make new friends in fear they will stab him in the back like they did before. The few friends he does have including myself don't really live close enough to check in on him or have the means to at this time, and we are just really worried this is the final time we will hear from him and that we will find out he isn't around anymore. His ex wife really messed him up and it doesn't help knowing she and her equally abusive mom have access to an unregistered gun from what her dad has said.

I(42M) have been with my gf for 9 years.\n\nWe live in Germany and my parents live in the UK so her having a close relationship with them was always going to be a bit harder than if they lived in the same town (or even country) as us.\n\nA couple of years ago my gf started to complain about my parents not contacting us enough. My parents just don't call our house claiming it's too expensive which seems more of an excuse because it's obvious they could spare a few extra pounds to call us. \n\nAlso, the last time they visited us was 2 years ago. Which just adds to the feeling that they're disinterested.\n\nNo matter how many times I ask my parents to make more of an effort, they don't. In part, I suspect this is because they have a negative view of my gf. With the exception of the honeymoon phase, the times that they visited us or we visited them, there was always some kind of incident where my girlfriend went into a mood that I was not giving her enough attention. On one occasion my parents witnessed my gf being outright verbally nasty to me because I had not stopped cooking dinner halfway to rush outside and meet my gf on her way back from work. Almost like a test to see if I would drop everything for my gf. Even though I often drop things for her.\n\nOver the last 12 months my girlfriend appears to have ramped up her scorn for my parents and is making more of an issue of my parents disinterest. I seem to have frequent conflicts with my gf over it. For me, it's simple: if my gf wishes to have a close relationship with my parents then let's work on it. For example: She has had the occasionally whatsapp message with my mum, so she could embrace that as a means of getting closer. But she refuses claiming that it should come from my mum. She refuses to go over to the UK to visit, insisting that it is their turn to come here.\n\nSo... the whole thing just ends up feeling like an excuse for my gf to fight about something. An excuse to pick on me telling me that my parents don't care or that other boyfriends made more of an effort than me. I feel powerless to do anything which is frustrating.\n\nThe irony is my gf claims all she wants is a harmonious relationship but what I see is someone making a big issue of something that is not completely under my control. \n\nThe issue with my parents is like an endless fountain of emotional abuse that she can direct toward me and that's why I'm writing here. I'm starting to think that the issue with my parents actually has nothing to do with my parents but more as an \"energy\" source that my gf can use to direct emotional abuse my way.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

There is still rage, but all of that is slowly beginning to fade. (Note the \"slowly.\")\n\nYes, he hurt me in a way that I didn't realize it was possible to be hurt in. Yes, he mocked the very idea of my human dignity, a feeling that I could never fully explain to someone who hasn't been through it. Yes, he made me want to end my own life for awhile.\n\nBut I didn't.\n\nAnd now I'm here. I'm still picking up the pieces but they don't look impossible to pick up anymore. In fact, I'm starting to wonder if this devastating encounter with sheer malevolence is not, by some evil design, actually an amazing thing that is to my own advantage, because now I can fix the cracks in my foundation and build myself from the ground up in the way that I would never have had the motivation or the discipline to do otherwise, had this train wreck not been thrust on me.

I don't know if she'd ever experienced narcissistic abuse from someone near and dear to her, but she knew what it was like to be hunted; she knew what it was like to have people out to kill her. But she was absolutely fearless. She absolutely knew her calling and she had allowed herself to be transformed in order to pursue it. I knew that she understood the process of having her own human dignity mocked (only to honor those who mocked her life which caught them off guard), of taking every thought captive to transform the way she perceived the world, of recovering from impossible situations. I feel like her hug started the process of sucking the venom out of my soul. There was literally this deep physical pain in my midsection as she hugged me. The venom went down sweet, but it hurts as it's coming out. Meeting her made me want to live again... to really, truly live. Because I finally met someone who also had to be extremely intentional every moment of the day in order to survive, and she made it. Like, REALLY made it.\n\nI don't know what the future holds. My Nex took even my ideas, plans and dreams for himself. So I don't know what it looks like to dream again. But it's slowly and organically beginning to happen. Little whispers of ideas and dreams are starting to flutter through my heart once more. But they have a different feel to them; a more pure, softly exciting feel as opposed to energizing and passionate. Maybe I really do have a hope and a future. I know it's a long road still... but for the first time, I can actually visualize a pathway through this pain. I'm going to make it.

Why is it messing with my head so much?", "author": "TTUgirl", "self_text": "Background: I\u2019m a non confrontational person and will do anything to help others and take care of other people. I starting dating my ex at 19 and his controlling behavior and temper escalated as the years passed. We were together 10 years and the last five were the rockiest. The occurrences of his scary side went from rare to more often each year. He had a short temper and very easily thrown into a red rage if he felt inconvenienced or irritated. I was always walking on eggshells because a bad workday for him could mean that if I didn\u2019t have the house perfect or if I didn\u2019t have the right things to say I was going to get yelled at. Sometimes I was just along for the rude as he raged at others like trying to scare other drivers to get them to move over or passing people on the grassy median. The middle of our relationship he started grabbing my arms to yell at me. The last couple years of the relationship he held me down and threatened to choke me because I forgot to take out the trash and the house smelled. I had bruises on my chest from his thumbs. Then I was starting to fear him less and stood up to him more which made it get worse. I ignored his ranting one time and played on my phone while he yelled at me. He hit me in the jaw and then stomped my phone into pieces. I was too scared to do anything at that point but that pretty much broke all my feelings I had for him. We had only been married about 6 months when this happened and so I waited to break it off. He got better for a few months and then went back being to being  ridiculous and told me I deserved getting punched. Told me he understood why his dad acted the way he did and he feels the same way. At that point I knew I had to exit or end up hurt or dead. I snuck out and lived with a friend until I could get him kicked out of my house and divorced him. \n\nWe have been divorced for a year and a half. I have an amazing boyfriend that is supportive and has never said an unkind thing to me in the year we\u2019ve been dating. I went to counseling throughout the divorce and she helped me see I didn\u2019t deserve any of the mistreatment he dealt to me. Living without my ex controlling me has been a freedom that I am so grateful for. I\u2019ve been successfully starting to do art as a side job and finishing my grad school degree. \n\nCurrent problem: Then on Friday one of my friends tells me that my ex is engaged. She shows me the girl on facebook and that they\u2019re getting married in May. They started dating fairly soon after I left him. I think it\u2019s the person he said had comforted him after I left and \u201chelped him see things from my side\u201d. He had gone to anger management to try to win me back during the divorce process. She seems like me and even has my same job. Now I can\u2019t get the constant thoughts out of my head. Part of it is I wish I could warn her that he\u2019s dangerous and controlling. Part of it is if he treats her nicer than me then why did I get treated so badly. Part of my thoughts are just reliving the good and bad parts of our relationship. Some of it is curiousity of if they\u2019re planning a wedding like we had and if he\u2019s happier with this wedding than he was for ours.

This morning I left my toothbrush on the sink and she had a completed meltdown, screaming about how I never do anything, she wants to blow her head off (I\u2019ve found 5 of the suicide notes she\u2019s written, dating back to around 4 years ago to a week ago). She doesn\u2019t get paid while the government is shut down, so that probably adds to her anxiety. She\u2019ll go months without a meltdown, then they\u2019ll be 3+ in a week. My mom and dad aren\u2019t together, and I live with her full time because me and my dad don\u2019t have a healthy relationship. Whenever I try to talk to her about anything, she turns it into she\u2019s a horrible parent, we\u2019d be better off without her, she\u2019s going to kill her self, etc. it can be about how I got nominated for a summer camp thing, and she\u2019ll turn it into she should kill her self so I can use the insurance to pay for it. She says she\u2019ll see a psychiatrist, but the earliest appointment date is mid February and if the government doesn\u2019t open she can\u2019t afford it, and she can\u2019t take most medication b/c she has a bad liver and bad kidneys.

I\u2019ve also been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and she turned that into how bad of a parent she was instead of trying to help me. I try and stay at school as long as I can everyday to lessen the chances of catching her in a mood. When she\u2019s in a mood, I can literally do nothing right and every attempt is met with yelling and blaming me for her meltdowns. She tells me I don\u2019t clean enough, then I start cleaning and she mocks me for trying to kiss up to her. I make too much eye contact when she\u2019s yelling at me, then when I look away she screams at me to look at her and to stop being a coward. She takes every little action as an insult to her character. She mocks my anxiety/depression (only when she\u2019s in a mood), saying how she dealt with worse and I should try harder to get over it, I shouldn\u2019t have it, etc. I\u2019m 16, and now have to physically leave the classroom to cry in the bathroom whenever the teacher raises their voice or I\u2019ll burst out in tears in front of the class.

We feed off of each other illnesses, we once had an hours long conversation about ways to kill our selves. Whenever I start to get really mad about her inability to take any real responsibility, she starts crying and apologizing and starts saying how I would be better off without her. I try telling her that\u2019s not true, she\u2019s not useless, etc, but it\u2019s in one ear and out the other. I can\u2019t live anywhere else, my grandma lives too far away, I\u2019m estranged from my dads side of the family, my grandpa is a bad person, I have no where to go and everything is just getting worse.

I really don't know where to turn to with this. I'm so confused and hurting. Made a throwaway for this. I \n\nI don't want to tell the whole story. Or, I want to, I really want to, but there is just so much and two months after the breakup I am still sorting out my thoughts and memories. I just wanted to ask whether or not some of these things can be classified as coercion or abuse, and whether or not I am justified in feeling the way I do- violated, scared, angry. I cry several times a day, can't control it. No matter what I do, my mind goes back to the things that happened. I can't stop thinking about them, nothing helps. I get shaky and feel like I can't breathe right. It's so, so hard and I have nowhere to go, I don't even know if it's okay to feel this way or if I am just making things up and making a big deal out of nothing. \nSo here are a few things that happened. \n\n- When I didn't want to have sex, he sometimes cried. I then felt so guilty that I cried too, and then we had sex. \n- If I wore clothes he liked and later said no to sex, he would tell me he felt 'tricked'. We agreed that I wouldn't wear 'sexy' clothes unless I wanted to have sex later. If I didn't want to have sex, I was told to signal it to him by wearing joggers or something similar.\n- He told me to decide in the morning whether or not I wanted to have sex that day, so he wouldn't get his hopes up.\n- When I slept over, he told me to sleep naked or in lingerie, even in the winter. He didn't force me, but he was so sad when I wore something warmer and I felt weak/guilty when I did, so I agreed.\n- Since he was so upset when I didn't want to have sex, we agreed that he could fuck me while I slept (so at least I didn't have to participate). One time I woke up to him touching me, trying to penetrate me, and eventually ejaculating on my thigh. I was so drowsy that I fell asleep again. The next morning I asked him about it and he denied it happened at all. I got very upset and he finally admitted that it did happen. \n- Sometimes when we didn't have sex and I just wanted to sleep, he'd pace around the apartment as if he was super stressed, flicking lights on and off, sitting down at the desk and standing up again, slamming the bathroom door etc. (to compare, when we did have sex, he was very relaxed and fell asleep with me immediately). I eventually felt so guilty for not letting him 'relax' that I let him fuck me even if I didn't feel like it. \n- One time I woke up and kept my eyes closed. He was standing at the foot of the bed, gripping my legs hard as if he wanted to spread them. He stood there for at least twenty minutes before he let go. The next morning I asked him about it and he also denied it. \n\nI loved him so, so much and just wanted to make him happy, to be enough. I wanted to be a cool girlfriend who's always up for it. Throughout our relationship, guilt was my most frequently felt emotion. I did many things out of guilt like you can read above. So is this all on me, since he didn't force me to do anything? Or was some of it coercion? I don't know who to ask.\n\nI have been diagnosed with vaginismus since then- sex is physically impossible. I avoid taking baths and showers as much as I can because I can't stand being naked. I am hyperaware of my sexuality and avoid wearing the clothes he liked. I get feelings of extreme guilt when I wear the 'no sex today' clothes like joggers or long-sleeves, even though he is long gone. I don't know what to do. He never forced me to do anything. I know I'm overreacting and that it wasn't so bad. But I'm overwhelmed by what I'm feeling.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry if this is super messy to read. I really struggle with putting things into words.

He doesn't have a diagnosis, but my armchair speculation is that he's covert NPD with some additional dissociative pathology that I don't know how to classify.\n\nWe share a social landscape within an extended community that has roots of 20+ years, and more specifically, we're both music makers within in. Since our breakup, he's attempted to have me banned from participation in things on at least four counts (for which he was shut down) that I know of, and he's escalating.\n\nHe approached a woman who is organizing a big music project for an event this coming summer, a sound camp at a regional burner event, and spent four hours telling her outlandish stories about me, telling her i'm a meth addict, i'm the abuser, yada yada. He's rewritten a lot of history too, distorting facts, making events up that didn't happen etc. (If he is living in this unreality as truth, his friends should have a different level of concern about his mental health). Based upon this conversation, it sounds like she is planning to exclude me from participation to \"give him some space\".\n\nI see this as a strategic move on his part, and an act of aggression against me. \n\nI have to challenge this or it's going to keep happening. How do I stop this, and maintain some semblance of social grace? Do I just completely expose him? What if people don't want to hear about it or know? Now that he's taken his first public swing at me, how do I swing back? I've been discreet for six months and that has not served me. I'm not sure that doing this in a public manner will work out well either. Either way, I have to deal with the false charge of being the abuser myself, too.\n\nAll I want is peaceful co-existence and cooperation between us. I wanted an amicable breakup too, but that's just not how duder rolls. The thing is, I'm not going anywhere. I've been a part of this community for twenty years and people aren't going to just ice me out. I feel more protective of my participation in music related things though. I'm relatively new at this, am succeeding beyond what I had ever imagined for myself, and it is literally my greatest source of joy. \n\nAny thoughts or advice highly appreciated.\n\nxo,\n\n\\-e\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My first abusive relationship was also my first sexual and romantic relationship at the age of fourteen. I was raped and continuously assaulted every day for seven months. It was through this relationship I learned about pornography, \"love\", my own body, and how to be sexual. Despite having healed from every single aspect of this relationship, porn has always remained a huge trigger to me and it is the one I can't shake. In this relationship, I was taught that one woman can never be good enough. That women in 'real life' can never be as 'sexy' or 'attractive' or even satisfying at all in comparison to the fantasy of porn. I was forced to watch it when I didn't want to with my partner so he could 'get off' because what I did wasn't 'good enough'. I was yelled at while it was playing in the sense that \"Why can't you do x, y , and z like so and so\" while being intimate. I was always taught I had to grow up and be like the women in thos videos. etc etc.   \n\n\nFast forward, I was retraumatized with similar abuse in a second relationship regarding porn.  \n\n\nMy quandry now is, how do I get past pornography being a trigger? I am in a happy, healthy relationship with someone who I want to be with for the rest of my life (mutual). I have healed nearly completely from everything I've been through and can say I'm confident and balanced. Except despite how sex positive, body positive, open minded, etc. I am, the thought or knowledge that my partner watches pornography is still difficult for me. I never shame, or ask for him not to, or have really even talked to him about this, but on a personal level, it creates anxiety, comparison, the feeling I'm not good enough, etc.  \n\n\nDoes anybody else have any advice to undoing a deep seeded trigger? Or a similar story? Or any advice? I'm worried it will always be this way. ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I want to paint an accurate picture of the problem, so that has to include my faults as well which led him to this point. \n\nI am a woman who has struggled with alcoholism for a while as I work and have worked as a bartender for many years. I would like to consider myself a generally nice jovial person on a day to day basis, but as I am a long term sufferer of past domestic abuse for an extended amount time, I found I slumped very deep into long standing depression and anxiety issues. I don\u2019t necessarily drink all the time, but more so when I feel very stressed or anxious to (seemingly) calm my nerves. This certainly doesn\u2019t happen every time, or even a quarter of the time, but I have blacked out from drinking and put myself in questionable situations before. As an example, I have called my boyfriend to meet me downtown and then waited on outdoor steps and kind of fell asleep, alone. I know that of course this is not only scary for me and him, but also frustrating for him to have a girlfriend who can put herself in this unsafe situation. We shared location on our phones so he was able to find me okay, but in general I know from his perspective (and my own) it\u2019s not acceptable. \n\nThere was a time I was drunk, unable to get into a club with my friends because my ID expired, and as I walked out on the street I called my best friend to pick me up from downtown, but I blacked out shortly after. She said when she arrived there was a guy on top of me sexually assaulting me. My boyfriend turned around and blamed me, which I understand I put myself in that position by drinking and passing out, but I cannot understand someone having no compassion toward me. When I hear this, I feel scared, I feel anxious and disgusted, but I feel even more hurt to have my boyfriend say it\u2019s my fault to be sexually assaulted. \n\n\nI admit my flaws, I am trying to change myself so much for the better, but it is not an overnight process to 1. Lose an addiction but also 2. Get over past abuse and psychological issues over night. But I am trying to drink less. \n\nI know my psychological issues are not for anyone else to suffer through or deal with, but as someone who loves me and wants to be with me, I do expect a level of compassion.\n\nI am the type of person who has numerous childhood friends from when I was 4-6 years old \u2014 lifelong friends, best friends. I will always have them in my life. But my boyfriend has come to a point where he isn\u2019t comfortable with me going out with anyone, talking to anyone, or basically doing anything without him. It\u2019s become so suffocating and depressing for me. I\u2019ve become afraid of mentioning anything to him for fear of him throwing things, breaking things, and screaming in my face. He will demean and berate me for even mentioning I went to my BEST friends birthday party for a few hours. When one of my best guy friends passed away, he said it\u2019s not acceptable to cry for another guy for three days. On family events, he is upset if I stay too long at my parents house. \n\nThese are just a few examples, but I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. This in itself has become abuse, which as a survivor, I just need to be away from. I recognize I perhaps brought this on myself, but I can\u2019t go on another day not being able to see my loved ones. If anything, an abuse victim NEEDS a strong support system. I don\u2019t understand why my boyfriend tries to take that away from me, and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\n\nBeyond this, in our alone time, he is my best friend. We have amazing times together and I don\u2019t consider him a bad abusive person. When I submit to his wishes and cut off my social life, he is wonderful to me. But I shouldn\u2019t have to do that. I almost feel that I\u2019ve brought this out of him, but it feels irreversible. I have tried in every way to healthily express my concerns and issues but he doesn\u2019t care or listen. He will not change. I don\u2019t feel, as someone who was already struggling, that I need this type of behaviour being done to me... but I also understand I as a person haven\u2019t made it easy to love me. \n\nWhat actions can I take from here to make this situation better?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

We have three (older children) from our first marriages, and an 11 year old son together. Our son has an intellectual disability. I have stayed home with him for 8 years while my lovely NPD husband works in my industry (I stupidly grandfathered him in). \n\nSo, my son and I went to a domestic abuse shelter last Monday. I went originally for a legal appointment and by then end of the day both my son and I were there. These are the events that have transpired since, and I find myself somehow in incredible shape this week. Let me quickly share how I did it....\n\nTwo weeks ago today, in desperation and panic I went to the mental health walk-in clinic. Now, this clinic also sees children, including my son. I honestly did not know the clinic would link our files, but they have. So, I go to the clinic and speak about the sexual abuse and how it concerns me for my upcoming hysterectomy. Luckily there happens to be a transitional worker from the shelter, we make an intro, and when I return home I call her to set an appointment.\n\nThe shelter appointment was last Monday. I went as an \u201cout-patient\u201d to get legal advise. By mid-day the shelter has found us a bed and insisted I pick up our boy from school to keep him with me. We are at the shelter now, they predict we will be there from 6-8 weeks. When doing the intake at the shelter they ask for a description of my husband, his car etc, and they phone that description into the police (as husband might call police looking for us, and police are to respond that \u201cWe ran from abuse to a safe place). On Monday I tell my sister, my mother and my son from my first marriage that we went to a shelter. Son asks if he can (finally!) call my husband to rip him a new one. I say ok. My son does.\n\nBy Tuesday night of last week husband was starting to panic and listen. He reads everything about NPD; he does a self-quiz that lights up the charts. He sends the quiz results to his therapist and tells her, \u201cMy wife might be right...\u201d Tuesday night he tells me is a dance between getting help and suicide.\n\nBy Wednesday of last week he is distraught. Wednesday morning I have a meeting with our son\u2019s school and the social worker, which basically outlines that I am the only point person for school. My husband cannot pick up our son without my say-so. \n\nBy Wednesday afternoon he is losing it, and does something really, really great (ah! Don\u2019t get ahead of me!) My idiot husband sends me an email, detailing that yes, this is my home, and my son\u2019s home, and we should be able to live in it. He details, **in writing** that he will move to spare room and put a lock on my bedroom door, just until he is able to convert the basement into an apartment. Yes, he puts that all in writing, and my son and I come home. Wednesday night he is contrite, he understands, he is unmasked and shamed. The shelter staff are supportive, but obviously not thrilled that we are going home.\n\nThursday he goes to work, installs the lock on my door when he gets home, our son walks to school and plays with his friend afterward. First thing in the morning I call shelter staff to let them know I am not reconciling, and still want that legal appointment. We spoke for an hour on the phone. I got my paperwork ready. \n\nBy Friday my husband is freaking out again. He knows that I know, that my whole family knows, and the scrutiny is killing him. He goes to his therapist on Friday afternoon and she kindly re-masks him for me.\n\nSo, it\u2019s now tuesday of the following week. My son and I are home, with a written admission from my husband that we are not safe here unless he is caged up. He also kindly provided a written admission that my son deserves to be in his home, and that Dad and his illness should accommodate that. \n\nSo, I managed to wrangle a written admission of guilt and a written offer of the matrimonial home and custody. \nI also managed to unmask him to my family, and he knows they are watching. Also unmasked to my son\u2019s counsellor, his school and the police department.\n\nI out narc\u2019c the narc. He is stuck, hamstrung and nowhere to move. His choices at this point (which I have laid out to him) are therapy/recovery (not really an option for him, I know, but placating him right now helps) or throwing himself into his work. He has no other choice; they are eyes on him like crazy.\n\nI have my appointment with the lawyer on Thursday. I do intend to fight for my home, as it is my son\u2019s home and my biggest asset (again, I haven\u2019t worked in 8 years to further his career). Ah, yes, guess who was also in a mood to admit in writing that I created and grandfathered his entire career?\n\nMy son and I came home because it is the best place for him (another nice tip: we suffered at the shelter, even shelter staff commented on how we were both like \u201ccaged animals\u201d in the shelter. All the more reason for us to petition for the home.)\n\n\nHe is stuck, exposed and strung. I am strong, unimpressed and taking charge. It was completely accidental, but holy shit. Yesterday he shoveled the walk, vacuumed and anything else he could think of to kiss my ass. He is scared, and it is his turn to be, as we have had our fair share.

I left him 5 weeks ago after a fight turned really bad.  We came back home after a party where we had both been drinking and I could tell something was horribly wrong. I told him I wouldn't be treated like this anymore and tried to leave. He grabbed me, threw me on the floor, jumped down on his hands and knees and started choking me and telling me what a selfish piece of shit I was. He then picked me up and threw me against the walls and snatched me around by my sweater. He then snatched me up by my collar and punched me in the face and threw me into the wall again. As I was lying there he told me I was pathetic and he took out his phone so that he could remind me the next day how pathetic I was.

Well there were many moments when he would just be flat out rude/controlling exc.. \n\nWe went to a fancy work party for his law office for christmas a few months after we started dating and I wanted to wear this really pretty christmassy red dress I own. He asked what I planned on wearing so I told him and he said \"No\". It was the first time in a relationship I had ever been told No over what I wanted to wear, I asked him why and he said he didn't want anyone staring at us and didn't want any attention on us at this HUGE company party, (with clients, paralegals, lawyers, and the owners of the law firm). He gave me so much grief about it. That I ended up not wearing the red dress...\n\nThrought the 10 or so months I put up with him he would constantly put me down, and always acted like he was superior to me, always wanted me to be one way, the way he wanted me to be. From my piercings to the way I wore my makeup he seemed to hate it all. He told me not to wear shimmer, to wear a different nose ring, to not say I love you when I felt it. He constantly wanted me to serve him and play \"mama\" to him. Wanted bjs or me to get him coffee or gifts and if I didn't he would say that I obviously didn't know him well enough to get him trinkets or small gifts. For holidays, or whatever. Often he would look at my face and make up and make a snide rude comment about how it was, (cakey, too much glitter, whatever)\n\nThere was also a time that I gave him a painting of mine, that I had painted one day early in our relationship, he had always liked it a lot so I decided to give it to him for christmas. Well months later he told me that it was bs I gave him that painting, because i didn't paint it FOR him. I painted it and gave it to him as an afterthought. (This particular thing really upset me for months, and still does every time I wanna give away my art, which now I really haven't done much art nor given away many pieces since he told me this) \n\nBut the time that stuck out the most was when I needed a minor surgery. My parents came back into town to help me with it, as they were home for Christmas that year anyway, and its good they did. Because my nex refused to even come over after I got home. I was in the hospital for a few days and miserable, like anyone is after surgery. I remember i had asked him if we could video chat for a bit since he hated the city I was having surgery in and refused to come visit me and he still said No. He said that he had a long day and needed to zone out with gaming. Fine whatever. \n\nWell when I got home he asked how I was doing and I said I was ok, but I wanted him to come over and snuggle with me and watch a movie and again he said No. He told me that my parents were too negitive for him to be around(which yes they can be a bit as well) and refused to even come see me. I remember we had plans for pancakes and coffee at his parents house less than a week after my surgery and that day I was really upset at him for not coming to see me and said I really didn't feel up to going out and that I just wanted to recover in my own bed at home, and again he got mad at me for that...he said that he was just trying to get me out of the house and how he was trying to make up for not coming to see me by taking me out all day. Which he said was nice of him. \n\nThis guy would constantly make plans and change them saying he wasn't up to doing that, and even though I wanted to he didn't care he wanted to zone out on video games. \n\n He still though called me every day and woke me up to talk about literally nothing, or to game and be on the phone with me while he was. Which of course he wouldn't even pay attention to anything I said during these times.\n\nBut the nex would always want me there if he had a cold or stomach bug or was just feeling down. Which I would always do. He constantly put his feelings and needs above my own throughout our whole relationship, and I had to deal with his mood swings, and his changing of his mind, and anything and everything he wanted I had to just go along with. Whenever I would try to tell him that how I was feeling and why I was feeling that way he would shut me down and tell me how my feelings were wrong and that I shouldn't feel that way because he didnt intend to make me feel that way.... I became numb after awhile and just kinda went along with the relationship in a fog for a few months before we ended up breaking up.\n\nEven after the breakup he still tried to control me, he said at first I could keep his things that he had left at my house, and then said that he needed them back. And upon returning them, once I had set up a date with a new guy, got mad at me for returning them saying he was hurt and that he felt like I was trying to push him away. He had already told me he had gone out on a few dates with a new girl at this point so I just decided that it was overdue to just let him go.\n\nI feel damaged and like I cannot talk about my feelings with anyone nor even tell people I like them when I do. And I am afraid that this has ruined the little faith I had left in me to tell people how I feel or to just be myself. Since he always \"unapproved\" of who I was. By saying things like I act like a kid, or that I need to be more grown up. I think I am getting better every day, but I still feel insecure and like people won't like me for who I truly am. Tho I am starting to let go a bit and rediscover who I was before him...\n\nI really don't know what else to say...this is just a few things he did throughout the entire relationship, I could go on for paragraphs, but I'll save that for another day... \n\nThank you strangers for reading this.

I had a massive fever all yesterday and last night. I had to go to the doctor and have surgery today. He, a 45 year old man, was suppose to call me this morning to make sure I was awake so I could walk there. He never did. I called a friend. I was so dizzy and weak and sick and couldn't think straight. The procedure was 2.5 hours long. I was crying because I was only partially under.   \n\n\nI got out and texted him saying how much pain I was in. I had to force myself to walk to the store to buy cat food since I have no one here to help me (inb4 someone says delivery grocery stores, I live in a small town in a country that doesn't delivery most things). When I finally got home, I texted him that I made it back and was now safe but in so much pain. I kept spitting up blood. He ignored me while on video call the 8 minutes, looking away. He cut me short and said he had to go to therapy (he hates therapy and only goes so he can get disability).   \n\n\nHe sent me a text 45min later saying therapy was over but he needed to go to the store, a task that would take 20 min or less normally - I would know, I've lived there with him.   \n\n\nI decided to phone a friend to distract me from all the pain. I fell asleep with more fever. Woke up and tried to have water with more meds. He finally messaged me 3 hours later saying he just got back from the store.... what store could he possibly go to that takes that long? He could leave the country and go to a store there and come back in that time. He didn't call me though.  \n\n\nI talked with a friend and watched some things on HBO. I was invited by a new friend who is from my country of origin to go out tomorrow with a group of other people and told him I wasn't sure because I was sick (didn't feel like saying surgery and all that).   \n\n\nMy boyfriend finally called me 30min ago and it's 9pm. He talked to me for 5 minutes. I asked him if he was sleeping for so long (12 hours last night til all morning and then 3 hours or more) because of the xanax he was taking... the xanax that was mine that I left there and didn't need. I didn't accuse him, just asked. He knows I don't care if he takes them. I asked him how therapy was, he didn't answer. Not sure he even went. He asked what I've been doing....... what have I been doing today!!!??? I said I have therapy tomorrow and was invited by my new friend. I said it would be nice to speak in my native language with someone else who also speaks it. He got mad and said oh this new guy who wants to just fuck you? He said he had to go and call his mother and hung up on me.   \n\n\nAll this after yesterday of him being silly with me on the phone and sending I love you texts and asking how I'm feeling and trying to see if I'm well.

I hadn\u2019t been single in a couple years, as I had a habit of starting a relationship right after another ended. So after a long string of boyfriends, I ended up with (we\u2019ll call him) Brian. \n\nI obviously wasn\u2019t ready to commit. I told Brian I wanted something casual after just leaving my previous relationship, but he ended up confessing that he loved me about a month in (We\u2019d known each other for a year and half at this point). I was confused often, since part of me was strongly attracted to him but still getting over my ex.  \n\nI made a horrible mistake in my confusion and ended up kissing another coworker when I was drunk one night. I had never cheated before, and I felt horrible. He was mortified, but wanted to stay for some reason. I told him I\u2019d do whatever I needed to in order to make things work.\n\nFor the first month, he would come home drunk and yell at me. I thought I deserved it. He would curse at me, mock me. I wanted to make things better, but was unsure of why he stayed given the way he yelled at me. I figured that this behavior was justified.\n\nAfter a couple months it calmed down. I was honest and communicative with him. We were getting along better, and I had asked if he\u2019d feel comfortable coming to thanksgiving to meet my family, and he said he was.\n\nThe night before the holiday, he was drunk again. One of his friends made him think I was out partying with his roommate because \u201cthis girl only drank one kind of beer that you also drink\u201d, and he said that he wouldn\u2019t come home that night AND not come to thanksgiving. He made me go through my phone to see what I was doing on September 21st, and I was freaking out. I even had my best friend help me search (it\u2019s turns out, I was with her the whole day). Then he called me and started yelling at me again, and my best friend was there to hear the whole conversation. She was furious and was convinced that he was being emotionally abusive, pushing that I end it.\n\nI\u2019ve tried ending it, but I find myself coming back to him. He won\u2019t stop drinking for me, because he doesn\u2019t think that alcohol is the problem. The other night, he came home so drunk that he couldn\u2019t walk straight. He kept grabbing me and blocking the door so I couldn\u2019t leave. \n\nIs this abuse? And why can\u2019t I find the strength to leave him? I feel so alone now, and I can\u2019t even be by myself now without getting depressed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Like a typical family with a narc parent, there is the golden child (My youngest sister) and there is the scapegoat. Me.\n\nUp until last September, I hadn't talked to my dad for the best part of 18 months and unfortunately, this is just a repeat of the cycle. We get annoyed at each other for a petty thing that her blew up, I stop talking to him for a long while until one or more of my other family members (Usually his parents) pester me to talk to him again because \"he's such a great person\" and \"he's do anything for me\". Basically they'll talk about him like he's the second coming because even at 46, he's still their precious angel child who could do no wrong. I mean, just ask my sister, she doesn't cause him any problems. They'll pester me every chance they get to welcome him back into my life with open arms and it works every time.\n\nI love my grandparent, I know I can trust them with my life, but not matter how hard I try, I can never convince them that what my dad does and says to me behind close doors hurts and terrifies me. My perfect nightmare is being locked in a space alone with him.\n\nA couple of years ago just before Christmas, my Nana invited me out to go Christmas shopping with her and I thought \"We haven't spent a lot of time together lately. Of course I'll go\" And for the most part, he had a pretty good time. Until it got to the drive home. She asked me:\n\n\"Do you know what I really want for Christmas?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"For you to get along with your dad.\" I try to tell her once again that my dad and I are best being as far apart as possible because we just don't mix. There is no possible communication between us and once again, she's not picking any of it up. She starts going off on the same speech, showing him in compliments about how kind her is etc etc, and then asks me \"What has he ever done to you?\"\n\nI give her this list of all the names he's called me, the trauma I was put through all through my teen years, how my youngest sister gets all the special treatment because she doesn't argue with him and I very quickly explode with tears at all the horrible memories I've had with him and for the first time ever, she drops it and we go home. She then has a talk with my mum about how upset I got and she never brought my dad up in front of me since.\n\nMy grandad wasn't as easily swayed.\n\nShe's fine now, but recently, my nana was diagnosed with breast cancer and while she was getting treatment, my grandad came over to visit me. He talks about nana and then about dad and the typical threat of praise. The he hands me \u00a3100 in cash, basically bribing me to talk to dad again because it would mean so much to Nana. I refuse the money, but he insists, I'm guilt tripped and what do you know? Dad is back in my contacts again.\n\nHe hasn't changed, wouldn't you expect? And regularly texts me about how much he misses me and how much he want me in his life. That's rich considering her hasn't invited me on any family holidays abroad, but took my sisters and no birthday or Christmas presents, but that's his logic.\n\nI just feel so emotionally torn between keeping my grandparents happy in exchange for my happiness and keeping myself happiness in exchange for theirs.

This is going to be a long post where I will attempt to detail a lot of the major events in my life that have created a rift between me and my dad (and somewhat to my mom). There will be a TLDR at the bottom.\n\nTo start, my parents got hitched when they were in their early 20s. Both have no college experience/education. I have never seen proof that either even graduated high school. They met in their home country. We immigrated to the US when I was 12.\n\nMy dad has had an abusive upbringing. From the bits and pieces that I've gathered from other family members, what I know is that: his father was terrible -- very physically and mentally abusive and a habitual cheater. His mother, according to my mom's family, was an angel. Extremely loving and patient. Withstood terrible abuse from her husband. On her deathbed (she died much earlier than her husband), all she asked was for her husband to hold her hand, and the man said no. This person (my grandfather) is a terrible subject amongst whoever I talk to in my family. Apparently he passed away while living with another woman more than a decade after my grandma's death.\n\nMy dad took on similar traits.\n\nAs soon as my parents got married and my mom got pregnant with me, he was physically abusive and habitually cheating. On my first birthday, when my mom confronted him about another woman, he beat her up in front of baby me and her parents (who tell me they were old at the time and frightened by this).\n\nOut of everything I can remember from my childhood, there is a lot of shouting, fighting, and throwing and smashing things from my dad. Him throwing food, smashing TV's, throwing a metal hole puncher at my mom and toddler me are specific memories that I still can recollect. I remember probably as a 5 year old I wet my bed and my dad held me by the window and threatened to throw me out of it (this was several floors up of an apartment building), with my mom shouting and crying helplessly in the background.\n\nThroughout this post I will continue to talk about my dad, but this is why I have some resentment towards my mom too. The fact that she didn't proactively choose to leave my dad was essentially choosing to put herself and me in danger. If she was smart and calculative enough to know what was good for her, I think the best option for her at the time would have been to leave my dad. I understand that as a single mother life might have been very hard, and I may have complained about why I didn't have a dad, but the fact that my dad tried to stab and kill me twice proves to me that the safer choice would have been for her to leave. One of the main reasons I believe she didn't leave is because she is very hardheaded and as the youngest of 4 siblings, she may have married my dad out of her own family issues (which are relatively minor). Her parents strongly advised against her marrying my dad, and she did, so when the marriage didn't work out very well, she chose to stick with her choice rather than admit that her parents were right.\n\nMy little brother was born when I was six. During the late stages of her pregnancy, my parents had a fight after my dad came home drunk one night. He beat up my pregnant mom, and when she said to stop because she was pregnant, she says that he said \"I'm gonna kill you both\", and stepped and kicked her pregnant belly. Thankfully my brother was born ok. My mom told me this story when I was about 15. Ever since I heard this, I've developed such a stronger love for my little brother. To this day, my brother is 23 years old, and does not know about this story. I don't know if I should share this story with him, and if so, how. He has a relatively good relationship with my dad. More on this later.\n\nMy parents moved around a LOT, mostly because they didn't have an education and career paths. I was not born in my parent's home country. My parents immigrated at least five times to different countries. Before we came to the US at my age 12, I had lived in 4 different countries with 3 different languages. I came to the US at 7th grade (middle school). Every single year of my elementary school was spent in a different school. Even after we came to the US, we moved around very often, and I spent every single school year in a different school. I've spent every year of my k-12 education at a different school. This was mentally very hard on me.\n\nAfter we came to the US, my mom left us. Actually, let me preface that. For most of my life before coming to the US, my father was almost an absentee father. He would claim he'd need to be away for work, and was almost always never home, many times for months. He'd hop countries looking for work (very uneducated decisions). His temper probably burned many bridges in his social/work life, so he was always looking to move somewhere else. In some of the countries where we lived, my mother barely spoke the language there. I can't imagine how scary that must be for a single mother with two boys. During most of the years, I believe my father came back with support money. My mom at one point had a small clothing store where she was generating income. But having an absentee husband while stuck in a foreign country was taking a toll on her. During the last stages of their first marriage, she was telling my dad that he needs to do his share and raise the kids. So when we came to US, my mom left my dad, and left her two boys with him. She went back to her home country.\n\nDuring the first year with living with my dad, life was relatively ok. We were dirt poor and illegal immigrants in the US, but life was ok. The US culture was a fun and exciting one to learn. Also during this time my father basically brainwashed us into thinking that our mother was a terrible mother who left us. During the second year, my dad brought over a woman with a daughter, and started cohabiting. Me and my brother weren't very happy, but my father said one of the reasons this is necessary is because he needs to marry an American so that we can live legally in the US. This woman was not very nice. She was the typical bad Cinderella stepmother. She drove her daughter to school which was a block away, but forced me to ride my bike to my high school 1.6 miles away where I was a new freshman. The route had a steep incline of 150 ft, as we lived on a hill. I grew giant stubby thighs and calfs, and my height didn't grow much after this. When my father would come home, she would tell him that I was bad and he would beat me up. Specific memories: he threw his shot of whiskey at my face. He spit on my face during dinner. He threw a dinner table chair at me. He put me in the back of his minivan that had no seats, and drove recklessly so that I'd be tossed around in the van. I was 13. The woman would not hit me, perhaps out of fear of retaliation, but would hit me 7 year old brother all the time. Some other memories that I have: he put our dog in the dryer and turned it on for a few seconds \"just for fun\". He took one of our dogs into the woods and left it there because we were moving and \"couldn't take care of it anymore\". We lived with the woman and her daughter for about 2 years, and their relationship never worked out so they never got married. Although I'm not sure, there is some suspicion that my dad cheated on her too, and so she left.\n\nNo longer living with that woman was a slight relief, but things didn't get much better. I was getting older with no legal status. My dad called my mom to make amends, persuaded her to come out to the US, start anew and live with us. Me and my brother were happy, but we would have to continue to live as an illegal immigrant family. My mom had not been back more than two months when my dad started beating on her again. One day I came back from school and my mom had a chipped tooth. She said she fell down some stairs. This reunited stage did not last long. My mom got a traffic ticket, and out of fear, convinced my dad that she was going back to her home country. They both assured me they were staying together, just in separate countries. My mom was taking my little brother to her home country. At this point, we had both become quite Americanized, and I emphatically told my mom to leave my little brother here with me. I didn't want to lose my brother, we had developed such a strong bond and connection. In retrospect, my mom made the safer choice.\n\nAfter my mom left, I had to live with my dad alone. I was 15, pimply faced and shy. Up until this point, I never had the mental strength and capacity to talk back to my parents, but I started coming into my own and standing up to illogical arguments. And so it happened. I stood up to him during an argument and told him he was contradicting himself, and he was wrong. He flipped, smashed several things around me, including my most valuable items at the time, my acoustic guitar. He also smashed my tennis racket and my gamecube. And then he took out the big kitchen knife, held me against the wall, and put the pointed blade about 2 inches from my stomach. At this point there was no point in arguing to win the argument, I had to say whatever I had to say to SAVE MY LIFE. I was 15 years old. I told him he was right and I was sorry. The situation diffused and I lived. This was the first time he tried to murder me.\n\nNot long after my mom left, my dad brought over and introduced another woman. He said they were going to get married. The woman had a little boy much younger than my little brother. I was very apprehensive and said no to the new relationship. I reminded him that I was told that him and my mom were still together. He smashed some more of my things and made me accept.\n\nThe new woman (stepmother #2) turned out to be different from Stepmother #1. Although not perfect, she was much nicer. She was college educated, and had a professional career. Not to my surprise however, the relationship was not harmonious. My dad's temper always got in the way, he was physically abusive with her, and he spent jail time for domestic violence (one of the only instances in this post where justice was served). The woman stayed with him but kept refusing to actually marry him (thus keeping my dad and I without papers). By my senior year, I had developed a good social standing with my new peers at my new school. I had good friends, and was enjoying life for the first time in what seemed like an eternity. Then one day, my dad came home, and we got in a very small argument for some minor thing. I wasn't even that worried, until he busted out the kitchen knife again, pinned 17 year old me against the wall, and pointed the knife 2 inches from my stomach. Again, I had to say whatever I had to say to save my life. Over some minor trivial thing. It was not the argument, but my dad's temper, and his lack of life principles, that almost ended my life again. I could not believe my life. Some time later, I penned up a letter detailing some of the horrific things he did to me and my family members that I was going to send to the stepmother. It was a tell-all type of letter heavily advising her to leave my dad. However, at the frail age of 17, I decided to keep the letter and not send it. Perhaps I was afraid of unpredictable consequences. My dad, who habitually went through my stuff without permission, one day found the letter and ripped it up into pieces. I lost whatever remaining respect I had for him.\n\nSince they didn't get married, I was still out of legal status in the US, so before I turned 18, my dad and my mom decided to send me to my mom's home country, where she was living with my brother. I hated it. I hated not having a single place or country to call home in my 18 years of life. I lived with my mom and brother in her home country (where I wasn't even born) for the next few years. Fortunately, and perhaps because of the absence of my dad, I thrived. I went to university there, built an exciting social life, and had great experiences. Eventually my dad and the stepmom got married, after I turned 21. My younger brother got his green card almost immediately and came to the US as a sophomore in high school. Since I was over 21, I wouldnt be able to get my green card until about 6 years later, at age 27. At around age 23, I came back to the US as an international student, calculating that by the time I completed my university studies, I would get my green card. Fortunately, things went according to plan, and I got my green card before my status as an international student expired.\n\nDuring this time as an international student, things were very rocky with my dad. At first, I moved back in with my dad, stepmom, brother, and stepbrother. However, as the oldest, my dad and my stepmom were very strict on my 23 year old self. They imposed 11pm curfews and habitually went through my stuff without notice. About a month after I first came back, my dad told me to go back to my mom's home country. This was routine. Once they found some marijuana hidden in my car, and gave me hell for it. They were so negative with me and always told me go return to my mom's home country. My stepmom always sided with my dad saying how much of a burden I was and how I didn't have anything to show for at the age of 23. I couldn't take it, and moved out at the age of 25. I was alone in the US, with limited legal status at the time. I was dirt poor and had no family. I spent Thanksgiving and Christmas that year alone in my rented bedroom, while my family members were having a nice dinner in their home two cities away. But I was able to manage. I finished my associate's degree and got a job with the temporary work visa. I started building my life slowly, in bits and pieces. But I had to do something I didn't want to. I had to reach out to my dad, because he was my green card sponsor, and he needed to be there during the process. I did, and we somewhat rekindled our relationship. However, from my side, it was not genuine. I have all these negative experiences with him, how could I just forget about it? Anyway, I non-genuinely got along with him until the process was over. During one instance, I missed his phone call and he got angry with me because my \"voicemail wasn't set up\" so he couldn't leave a voicemail. During the same conversation I asked him to relay a message to my uncle (stepmom's brother-in-law) about something regarding the green card process, and he flipped again, saying I was always asking him for help. He hung up on me and blocked my number, even though I needed him to be present for my green card interview. This was obviously extremely stressful, as I had waited so arduously for my visa interview. If he hadn't brought me to the US as an illegal minor I wouldn't even have had the strong desire I had to live in the US. Fortunately I called my stepmom for help and she arranged it so that he would show up at my interview, which he did. I finally got my green card, which was a very happy moment.\n\nTowards my dad however, my emotions were naturally very confused. I was supposed to be thankful for him, he was my visa sponsor. He had still helped me throughout the process. He showed up for the interview and vouched for me that I am not a fraudulent person. He also did some things to help me out during the time I was an international student: He bought me a $17k car. He spent about $16k on my university education. He gave me about $5k when I moved out.\n\nBut he was also very hard on me. He told me to leave several times. He stopped paying for my uni education after my first year, so I had to transfer to a cheaper community college, and work under-the-table to pay for school myself. All in all I earned and paid another $16k in school tuition on money earned from menial under the table jobs.\n\nMy dad has shown some progress in terms of mental growth. Not a lot, but some. He still talks about leaving his family behind and moving somewhere tropical by himself. He treats my stepmom with no respect, like telling her to shut up when he's talking and orders her around to bring food and such. My brother has told me that my dad shows some regret in how he treated me. My brother can probably smoke a marijuana joint in front of him and my dad will try to be \"cool\" with him. Obviously he is older and weaker now, and I am stronger than him, so some of this is expected. When he had all the power, and I was powerless, he beat me up and made my life hell. Now he just doesn't have that power.\n\nThis is where I am at a dilemma. I don't know how to deal with my dad moving on. Its not something I stress about. Its just something that comes up once in a while when I take long showers, or when the holidays approach. I am sure my dad wants to have a rekindled relationship with me. But always up until now, he has had the upper hand, and I've had to oblige in order to improve my life. Now that I have my life in control, I can make a fair decision whether to include him in my life or not.\n\nI'm 29 years old now, and for the last few years I have built the beginnings of a life for myself. I have a professional career, an amazing SO that I will be engaged with soon, and will even be starting grad school next fall. I've distanced myself from my dad.\n\nWhen I think about all the evil things he did, I just want to cut him out. I don't want to include him in the rest of my life. I don't want my future kids to know him. I don't want to give my dad the pleasure of knowing his grandkids either. I already introduced my SO to him, because my SO wanted to meet my parents. I did that because I wanted to make my SO happy, not my father. I didn't enjoy giving my dad the pleasure of meeting his son's SO. The only positive I can think of that will come from rekindling our relationship is that I'll have my dad and stepmom as members for future family events: Thanksgiving, Christmas cards, and such. Even as such, I would be annoyed at having to interact with him at such events.\n\nI would consider my father to have some sort of mental disorder. He works hard and has partially provided, but is a ticking time bomb who is very destructive when prodded. He is also very uneducated, which means he has worked hard, not worked smart, and still does so going into his late 50's.\n\nWhen I think of the negative stuff, I consider these options: Pressing charges and suing him. Revealing all the nasty stuff to his wife, the stepmother. Revealing the nasty stuff to my brother.\n\nWhen I think of it optimistically, I still feel like there should be something done. I can't and shouldn't just forget the past and rekindle our relationship. I feel like I need to let out my thoughts. Remind him of his actions, let him know what I know and how I feel. I feel like I will need an apology, a real apology, before we can attempt any sort of reconciliation.\n\nBut knowing my dad, and his destructive temperament, I'm afraid to communicate my thoughts to him. I'm afraid he'll flip out and destroy everything that is good around him. I don't want to bring harm to his wife (the stepmother), me, or anyone else. This is a real concern for someone like my dad.\n\nI could go about it in a neutral manner, which is what I'm doing now. Just a few texts a year, for holidays and birthdays. Maybe see each other once a year during family gatherings. But this causes me to stress about it alone. I don't want to interact with my dad, I don't want him involved in my family's future, without a firm acknowledgement and apology from him.\n\nTLDR: Dad caused terrible childhood. Physically abusive and detrimental to childhood growth. Tried to murder me via knife stabbing twice. Helped me out sometimes (as a father is expected to do), but also caused me much mental distress. Now I'm wondering if I should cut him out completely, or allow the relationship to be rekindled.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

My Dad was on drugs and had mental problems, he would frequently trash the house and hallucinate. My mom re married to my stepdad. My stepdad is a massive narcissist, he says that I have an ego, while he thinks he is the most perfect person on the fucking planet. As a kid I was a trouble maker, so me and my stepdad didn't get along very well. He would often verbally/emotionally abuse me, as a kid I brushed this off. After a while my stepdad began hitting me. It rarely happened, but when it did, It was more of a beat down than a punishment. He hit me with a wooden spoon or his belt, until my ass was bleeding and I couldn't sit down for a week. Once he punched me in the head and I had to stay home from school so no one would see the bruise. My mom, who is a lovely woman, didn't care because she thought he was so great. Once he forced me to eat my own fucking vomit. \n\nAs I got older, I had problems at school. One of my friends got bullied by this group of kids until he had to leave the school. The group then started targeting me. I was getting bullied and beat up after school. One time when I was getting stomped by the group of kids, a group of my friends showed up to help me out. After a massive fight in the parking lot, I managed to gain the upper hand against the main asshole. I wanted to beat the fuck out of him, but I decided that I wouldn't sink to their level. After this, the jerks left me alone. I started to make new friends, gained an interest in drama and martial arts. My life was great for a couple years, even my stepdad started acting really nice to me, I started having an actual father-son relationship with him. \n\nEventually we moved to another city, I was devestated  because my friends were probably the only good thing in my life. This led me to become emotionally unstable, my pre-existing anger problems get worse and I began suffering from depression. I quit my hobbies and became a shadow of my former self. I used to be a very confident person, now my self esteem has taken a nose dive. I hated my self, I tried to commit suicide, not because of sadness, but because I was so enraged with my self that I thought I deserved to die. At my new school I got bullied often, because I had become very introverted. This led me to get into plenty of physical fights at school. I became more angry and got into more verbal fights with my parents. Just as I began to hit an all time low, I started making new friends at my new school. \n\nHowever my life at home has become unbearable. Both my parents (more so my stepdad) abuse me emotionally and verbally at every chance they get, they get mad at the smallest things I do, only to use them as excuses to berate me. My stepdad said that I am horrible person, that the older I get the more he hates me, that I have no friends, that I am a loser who will end up on the street doing drugs like my real dad (Have never touched an illegal drug in my life) Eventually I lost it, told my stepdad that he was being ridiculous and he had turned me into a horrible person. This led to my stepdad attacking me, punching me in the chest so hard, breathing hurt for over a month. \n\nWhat makes it even worse was that I recently had a really bad pneumonia attack, nearly died. My stepdad keeps throwing it in my face that he saved my life by driving me to the hospital when ever I have an argument with him. His verbal/emotional abuse is worse than ever, while he hasn't hit me in a long time, he gets so angry I am scared he will do it again. He calls me a pipsqueak and asks if I want a piece of him. I am scared of him, I can't fight back, as he is a massive guy with training, whereas I am short, skinny and 15. My mom takes his side in every argument. Because of his abuse, I have become a shadow of my former self, feeling depressed and enraged most of the time. Every time I try to build myself back up off the ground, his cruel words knock me back down into the mud. \n\nPlz give me some advice! How do I deal with my stepdad. How do I control my rage. How do I regain my self esteem and fight my depression.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

This is the first time I'm going to publicly talk about this and I'm quite nervous. Sorry it's so long, TL;DR at the end.\n\nA long time ago, at the end of 2015, I worked with a coworker for a handful of months. All together, about 6 months. I purposefully seeked her out to befriend her and tried my hardest to make her feel comfortable, because she seemed uncomfortable in her own skin, wouldn't talk to anyone, wouldn't smile at anyone, and stayed in the corner of the room dusting the same shelves over and over again. I've been in her situation before, and I remembered that my old manager at my last job was what got me through; she showed me the ropes, and befriended me, held my hand through what I was supposed to do, and I thanked her every day for that. So I tried to be that for this girl.\n\nWe met up three times overall outside of work: first, ot the beach together, where I felt like I had to pull teeth to get conversation out, was very anxious and highstrung and felt like she didn't enjoy herself at all, but I thought.. maybe that's just her anxiety?  don't know. So a second time: I invited her to my place. Again, felt the same way, asked my family how they felt and they agreed: she seemed to hate it, or at least be very uncomfortable, so I thought one more time, with my best friend, we'll go somewhere public and see if it's just me. A handful of months later me, my best friend, and her go to the beach and he agrees, it's uncomfortable.\n\nSo I think, fuck, I'm forcing my friendship on this person, right? She doesn't want it, and if she's working with me still, I don't want her to be too uncomfortable around me to show up for work. So I back off, do my work, talk to my mates, etc. whilst still caring about her and sitting with her. I went through a rough patch (diagnosed chronic depression, anxiety, OCD, and ptsd) and when she questioned if I was okay with her, I reassured her I was just struggling. I made a post on a private blog about some of my ssues, and she took it to be about her. I told her it wasn't (since it was about an old friend who wouldn't leave my best friend alone) and reassured her, and told her I'm mentally ll, and sometimes I just need a bit of 'me' time.\n\nIt's all fine until I posted something about \"those people who get you through the toughest times in your life\", and tagged it with some friends I've had since I was very young. They held my hand through suicide attempts, times where I'd get up at 4am and cut my legs open, when I'd stand over the train platform and scream at myself to jump.. and she messaged me and says, \"did you purposefully not tag me in that post just to hurt me? Because I'd never do that to you\"\n\nAnd I admit I got angry. I got *really* angry, because until this point if I was depressed, or angry, or anxious, at one point I was depressed over an ex who left me and I was pondering what could've been, it was always about *her*. I tried to reassure her several times over the course of our weird, unstable friendship that there's nothing wrong with her, I just need space.\n\nIt kind've blew up when I started university, and she sent me an accusatory (or at least, I read t that way) message on Facebook about how I was being \"hot and cold\" with her, how she never knew if I was mad at her or not, and how I was *obviously* pissed off at her because she came out to me as bisexual and \"if anyone would understand I'd think it'd be you\" and it was just.. the last straw. My anxiety's already on high, I'm in public, in a lineup of hundreds of people I don't know, touching them, talking to them, she knows this and still keeps telling me I secretly hate her and I broke down bawling in the university bathrooms at the pressure of it all.\n\nShe tried apologizing to me, and I told her again to please just leave it alone, let me think on it, I *really* need space and the last thing I need after a panic attack is to talk more, and she just.. followed me and kept trying to apologize. I bit my tongue, went home, and messaged her that I think our friendship is really unhealthy and something about \"I can't be the kind of friend you need, but I wish you all the best\" where she tried to argue back. I ran my messages by a small group of friends (since the last thing I wanted was to hurt her feelings, I just needed to get away) to make sure I wasn't being harsh, and I told her I was just going to leave and play ssome video games.\n\nFew hours of playing Dragon Age later and she's messaged me numerous times, called me out for giving her the cold shoulder, I softblocked her (blocked then unblocked her on Tumblr, so we weren't following eachother) at the suggestion of my friends and she *immediately* messaged me to ask me why, she sent me several messages over the course of a week, then when I was cooling down and entertaining the thought of telling her I was okay to continue a casual friendship, she made a post suicide-baiting. She's told me before she purposefully posted things at times where I'd see them, and she said she was going to kill herself.\n\nI decided then and there that this *really* wasn't a healthy relationship at all, and that I needed out. After a couple of months of her posting about how miserable and depressed she was, I realized I fucked up somewhere, hurt her when I never wanted that, and I needed to apologize, even if I still wanted out of the friendship. I apologized to her, asked if there was anything I could do to help her heal, she didn't want any of it and I was cool with that, so I thought we were done. She messaged me for my birthday, I said thanks, but didn't really continue conversation. I don't think either of us were interested.\n\nA few months later I find out she's been posting about me, how I'm abusive, narcissistic, a couple of my friends messaged her anonymously to try to cool her off but she made a long rant about how nobody will love me unless I get the therapy I \"so clearly need\" or something, she's lambasted me all over Tumblr and Reddit, told her friends that I purposefully tried to befriend her \"just to abuse her\", and every time I've made a new account she's found it.\n\nI've made several new accounts, new identities, new friends, and she finds me. She uses my friends names in casual text posts to get me to question whether they're in contact with her or not. Any and every new friend I get I have to wonder if they're telling all my dirty secrets to her because she *always* finds me. I can't vent privately on my own secret blog, that only TWO people have access to, because my *private venting* is mean to her. I could post about anyone, *anything*, and she thinks its about her. I posted recently about some of my vent feelings about her (again, to the private blog) and she's found it. I posted venting about *myself* and she told people it was about her, and that she was going to hurt me over it.\n\nI just want to be left alone. All I want is to be left alone.\n\nMy biggest regret in life is trying to befriend this girl, because it's opened this massive fucking door for her to use me as her punching bag. Anyone who knows her thinks that I'm a monster, that I preplanned this, that I wanted to hurt her from the start. Hurting her was the last thing I ever wanted to do; I talked to multiple people about how scared I was of hurting her, how I really just wanted what was best for her, how I genuinely just fucking wanted us both to be happy and I didn' think it was possible with her so deeply invested and me not feeling that connection. \n\nI just want some peace already. I'm so tired. It's 2019. Please just leave me alone and let me live in peace.\n\nYes, I've tried ignoring her posts. I've ignored most of it, and spent months without checking anything of hers. It's hard to ignore when someone is actively, and publically, checking every little thing you do. I've also seen several therapists, who say I show no signs of having a personality disorder.\n\nTL;DR: Awkwardly befriended a coworker, friendship wasn't healthy, now she stalks and harasses me, tells people I'm an abusive narcissist, threatens me, etc. and I just want to move on.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

So they became best friends when she was 22 and he was 40.  Odd in itself.  Her husband became suspicious they were cheating so my bf pretended to be gay.  They are part of the disc golf community and everyone has thought he was gay since he \"came out\" but now he's dating me (cis female).  His friend used to live near his but now lives 2 hours from him, near me.  \n\nHis friend (will call her L) asked him to be in a disc golf tournament this weekend with her and her husband.  I don't play much, he asked if I mind and I said of course not. (however I have to pay his $25 entry fee because he's broke.). Then she asked if he could spend the night at her house the night before.  He told me he felt he owed her a 'friendship debt' and that they used to do overnights all the time.  I figured her husband is there and hes fine with it so why not.  I said that was fine.  I wanted him to have time with his friend.  \n\nThen yesterday I found out that they are going to a big disc golf bon fire party Friday night before sleeping at her house. A lot of people will be there and I'm usually invited to these things but this time im not.  Mind you this is in my town, where I live, and I have already agreed to the sleepover but now my feelings are hurt because I was excluded from the party.  I understand if they need friend time but now it's not 1:1 time, it's a party and his friends husband will be there, just not me.  \n\nIn the past he has resorted to yelling at me for hours when upset.  I broke up with him and went back when he promised to stop.  We argued a little during text about this at 4 pm.  I was going to my friend's house and he asked me to call him later and tell him what I want him to do to fix it. I called him 5 hours later and he answered saying \"what's up?\". I said hi, how are you?  He said everything is fine.  I said, 'everything is fine?  I thought you were waiting for me to call you?  He said, no we are fine nothing's wrong.  I said yes it is and you know that.  He said, \"you have asked me not to yell so im doing what you wanted.  So everything is fine\". I said no it's not... and he said \"I've been crying for 3 hours why are you attacking me? I've done nothing wrong!!! And hung up on me. \n\nThen he texted to give him time to calm down.  Then called me back. I  calmly asked him how and why this happened and told him I was hurt he said he could not deal with it right then because he was 'too cold in his house and in a bad mood'.  I told him again my feelings were hurt and I'd like to know why I was not invited.  He has been asking me to hang out with his disc club friends more so why was this omitted?  His next answers were \"omg\" \"I don't know, Jesus!\", I'm too cold to deal with this\". I don't think she purposely slighted you'.  \"I thought you had other plans\". \"it's just disc golfers you are not really into it\", etc.  \n\nI stayed calm and told him I just need a straight answer so I can try to feel better because I was hurt.  He went into a tirade of \"f*** it I'm quitting disc golf, are you happy?\". \"I am cutting off my friendship with her, are you happy?\".  Then came crying, raising his voice, then accusing me of attacking him all day when I know he's cold at his house and moody, then saying I was testing him to try to cause him to lose his temper like he has on the past, then saying I was testing him.  Then saying I was being very aggressive and hostile to him.  I was being none of those things.  The reaction from him made no sense.  Why couldn't he just answer the question and why cry and yell and accuse me of all these things.  \n\nThen he said he doesn't know if her husband will be in town or not.  He has told me that she has tried to have sex with him 3 times when drunk and he has said no.  He has a naked dance he does as a joke and she has seen that.  But now her husband may not be there but \"I don't knowww, omg, I don't know, I have no idea, she makes the plans, I don't know!!!!!!!\" He said.  Whining very high pitched and acting on the verge of crying.  Then he again told me he doesn't appreciate me 'testing' him and trying to provoke his temper. \n\nAt no time during all this did I ever get a straight answer.  The best I got was that he screwed up and didn't think about inviting me.  \n\nThis man spent all last weekend telling me he loves me so much, best relationship he's ever been in, how great I am, how he misses me during the week and can't wait to live with me.  \n\nWhat is going on????

Or are they really just idiotically unaware of the purpose of a bathroom door?\n\nLong story is my attempt at setting boundaries:  My 1st husband did this all the time.  He would walk in on me at any time.  My apologies for not wanting my sexual partner to walk in on me wiping my ass.\n\nI have discussed my desire to be left in peace when I'm on the toilet.

In every house, I made sure that the master bath had a \"water closet\" - basically the toilet inside the bathroom was enclosed and had a lockable door.  So that makes two lockable doors.  He'd still unlock and walk in, or otherwise bother me doing my business.\n\nI divorced that one.\n\nThis next husband is a different type of narc.  We have formally, emotionally separated, and due to too many details for this post, we are living together until my son graduates HS next year.\n\nMy 2nd husband also always barges in the bathroom.  We also put an addition on his house (master suite) and I made sure to include the water closet in the master bath.\n\nUsually, I lock the outer door, and now, because he's barged in, I also open the drawer by the door so the door won't open all the way.\n\nIn the middle of the night last night, I got up to pee.  \n\nHe has prostate issues.

I had these hopes and dreams that got shattered in matter of seconds, he took me to a restaurant and I had the full hope we would be discussing our future of finally moving forward. What he did do however, was dump me in a public setting hoping that I wouldn\u2019t break down and cry, sob, or get upset at him. \n\n***\n\nWhen we first started dating I made it very clear about the baggage I had. Divorced, a 9 month old, and recovering from being left at 4 months pregnant to raise a child on my own. I always had a sneaky suspicion that something was up with him but never had any proof of anything...\n\n...fast forward two years and he had broke me down so much, \u201chow can I love you when you can\u2019t even love yourself\u201d, that I didn\u2019t even know who I was, and he broke it off, but requested that he still be allowed in my daughter\u2019s life. I told him no. You can\u2019t continue to coparent a child that you\u2019re not the father to. We were a package deal, you don\u2019t get one without the other.\n\nI did and still do want a father for my child but I had told him he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to remain in just one of our lives. He then started telling me other things, like he wasn\u2019t certain he even wanted to date a woman with a child (didn\u2019t hide that), then a few months later it bothered him that I had been married before (again, didn\u2019t hide it).\n\nAnd then an ex girlfriend of his contacted me. Her true intentions showed up later, she was trying to get back with him, and she told me all the things he had done to her. I learned that the whole time I was suspicious is because he was still messing around with her...I was furious and I called him on it. He had all kinds of excuses, my love for him was so deep that I stupidly forgave him...but I couldn\u2019t fully ever trust. \n\nWe had our ups and downs over the next three years His mom being a huge obstacle in our relationship and her being equally narc and obviously supported the idea  that he could never do any wrong. I was continually told different lies about why our relationship never went to the next level, I believed these things, I sought therapy and psychiatric care for severe depression. I was blinded by what was actually happening because I loved him. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until recently I started realizing this wouldn\u2019t really work out. I had shut down every time he had shut me down, and he had done that on purpose. And it happened multiple times with multiple things from my parenting, to what I do for a living, my hobbies....he broke me down, on purpose, and twisted anything I had sense of what was rational to manipulate me and make it work in his favor. For instance, just yesterday I told him that I shut down after I asked him for help and he scoffed at what I told him I needed. So I never asked for help about it again....his answer \u201cwell you never said anything!\u201d I countered with \u201cbut you never cared to ask, instead you just want to now point out all these changes and blame me for whatever happened.\n\nThe worst part about all of this is he still wants his cake and eat it too. He wants to be in my daughter\u2019s life. I told him numerous times after she started calling him dad to NOT let her call him that if he didn\u2019t intend to actually be that, a family with me and her. He never said anything and when he broke up with me at that restaurant, it was the first thing he asked for, I said no. He doesn\u2019t deserve that right? My kid doesn\u2019t deserve that even though she loves him (she\u2019s 5 1/2 btw ) it\u2019s hurting her so bad but I can\u2019t continue to let her learn how a man should tear a woman by allowing him back in her life. Im so torn, I asked for N C and he keeps saying but him and her can still k. \n\nMy head is screaming No NO NO! But my heart so Terribly aches for my child....I feel crazy.

I was a pretty textbook victim myself, in that it took me a lot of time and false starts to steel myself and do what had to be done. (And I wasn't going to get any help from him - ugly dramatic on-and-off push-pull oops-we-slept-together now-we-hate-each-other \"friendship\" is his absolute jam.)  So when I did lower the boom, I said in these words: \"If - and it's a big if - I ever want to see or talk to you again, it'll be years from now.  Assume it will be never and don't contact me.\"\n  \nHe was stunned, of course.  (Feel free to giggle, my friends, at the image of a raging narcissist choking on his own disbelief that ANYONE could make a DELIBERATE CHOICE to carry on living without the gift of his presence once they've sampled his incomparable specialness!)  He rattled his chains once or twice in the subsequent months (\"I know you need space and I haven't wanted to transgress, but...\" *transgresses*), but eventually I sealed up all the cracks in blocking him and his attempts died off.  \n  \nI've kept up NC with never even the slightest slip - no matter how sad, angry, lonely, drunk, etc. - for the last couple of years.  Of course it was excruciating at first, but the farther away I got, the more front and center it was in my mind that talking to him when I was upset had never, even once, made me feel better.  He's the poison, not the antidote, and I missed that poison in my life less and less.\n  \nI've done a lot of hard work on recovery since then (seriously, if he'd run me over with his car instead of taking me to dinner the night we met, I'd have been in better shape faster), and although some minor flings have come and gone, I'm just now for the first time in the early stages of a relationship with long-term promise.  And WOULDN'T YOU DAMN WELL KNOW IT, like he sensed a disturbance in the force, guess who managed to sneak around my email filter just the other day?\n  \nThe message itself was basic Narc 101: Something mushy about a gift I gave him back in the day, and a \"thanks for all the good times\" we had together.  So many questions - What good times?  (I mostly remember tearful begging on my end and sullen contempt on his.)  How many of his contacts did he burn through before getting all the way to the bottom of the supply barrel with me? Has his life gone horribly wrong? Did he somehow catch wind that I'm with someone else?  Is he regretting his choices and behavior?\n  \nThe correct answer to all of these, of course, is WHO CARES with a side of NOT MY PROBLEM.  I shared the message and a tasteful yet satisfying \"I win\" dance with a few of my closest friends, and as satisfying as it would have been to write back \"lol\" or \"new phone who dis,\" they reminded me that any breadcrumb from me would be exactly what he's looking for and to leave it alone (and tighten up my email filter).  \n  \nSo, bad news: You can't ever be sure they've given up for good.

I knew something about him always felt off; I always felt like he was playing mind games with me but I'd just brush it off as unjustified paranoia or anxiety on my end and would ignore it. However, I did a quick internet search about his manipulative behavior, and have come to the conclusion that he is possibly a covert narcissist - I wasn't aware of these psychological terms before...it's all new to me; yet, upon reading up on it, it sounded exactly like my ex.\n\nApproximately a month ago, one of his closest friends contacted me asking to go out and drink with him. Hearing from other friends, I knew veerrryy well that my ex pursued girls immediately after we broke up. I heard about his quick flings, and knew about his new relationship. I didn't even bring up his name even once when drinking with his friend. Right before I was about to call and Uber and leave, his friend started relentlessly prodding me about what was going between my ex and I; he would keep asking me the same question 4-5 times to which I would give him the same reply \"Literally nothing is going on between us..we broke up months ago.\" I thought it was really strange because I knew he knew damn well about all his hookups and girls after me, it almost seemed as if he expected a different answer from me which is why he asked me several times. It was really stupid and made it obvious that perhaps my ex was trying to keep tabs on me. (However maybe I'm just overstating my importance in his life which is why i wanted to get a second opinion). I recently checked his insta and saw his post with his new girlfriend. I looked at the date and he literally posted it the day after I went out with his friend.\n\n...Is it possible that he was trying to get an emotional reaction out of me?

He suggested solutions that require no effort on his part and now I'm the a-hole for being upset at his apathy and disrespectful demeanor towards me. \n\nBackground: my toddler hasn't had a night in the past month where she hasn't woken up at least once, if not multiple times. The most recent time he had woken up with her, he couldn't get her back in bed, and ended up waking me by opening my bedroom door and yelling \"think you could help me out at some point?!!\" That was 3 months ago, and I've been vigilant about making sure he doesn't get up with her at all, therefore I don't get yelled at (accommodation at its finest \ud83d\ude44). Also, I am facing some legal things that could (unlikely but possibly) send me to prison for possibly years. Basically I'm a hot mess of stress and anxiety and trying to plan for two alternate futures for my children/self. \n\nFast forward to last week. I read the post about complimenting men, and I thought I might try it and see where it leads. We all know N's love hearing about how great they are, so I figured there was no downside. Even though I don't want 10, 40, 60 more years of this up and down bullshit abuse, I've been building my self-esteem up by still trying to be a positive-growth partner while I'm still around (along with therapy &amp; a set escape plan). I do care about him regardless of how empty he is inside, but I digress. So, Monday night when he got home and we did our nightly tv (new girl), I embellished on him. Everything is great, he loves it, so I do the same Tuesday night even tho I had woken up at 4am with a 24hr stomach bug (and got yelled at by the toddler all day for getting sick \ud83d\ude02). Again, he loves the attention. That night/morning I woke up with a sick puppy 3 times, the little one twice, and for myself once. I think my longest stretch of sleep was 1.5hrs that night. But I still got up at 630 Wednesday with the kids, made breakfast, and got one off to school, even though he was off work and home that day. \n\nAs soon as the oldest leaves and I'm sipping my semi-warm coffee while being slapped by the toddler in my lap, he crosses his arms and says he needs to talk to me, that I've seemed down, that he doesn't know if I need to stay in bed longer in the morning or what but my attitude in the mornings is affecting him and making him not want to be around me. (Now, I don't complain, I'm a sahm and I do literally everything. Literally. He hasn't cooked a meal for everyone in over a year, and in two years of owning the house has never mopped, vacuumed, done laundry, cleaned the bathrooms, grocery shopped, etc. I do it ALL, including caring for the kids.) I explained that I didn't really know what I needed, as I am easily overwhelmed emotionally, mentally and physically at this point due to the unending list of things to do, plan, lack of sleep, stress, grief, guilt, etc etc. I'm beginning to have a panic attack just explaining this bit to him, and it's obvious. He comes back with \"maybe you should talk to your therapist\", and I asked \"when?\" because he's gone 12 hrs a day and I have a toddler 24/7. He then suggests that I should have slept in his bed last night like he told me to (it hurts my back like no other bed ever), and then he suggested I just stay in bed after waking up. Know what? I lost my cool. I angrily explained (again) the shit I'm under, how little sleep I got while he snored away, how I was sick all the day before but had yet still went out of my way to express nice things to him, how concerned I am for my kids' future lifestyle with just him. I was/am so mad. MY general exhaustion before coffee kicks in is so upsetting and awful that I'M the one who needs to put out the extra effort for HIM so HE can enjoy his life more. I should be allowed to be tired, grumpy, frustrated... but I don't feel like I am. Nothing but positive feelings will satisfy this cactus! \n\nAnyways, he ended up leaving and occupying himself for the rest of the day, so he didn't have to put out any effort himself. That evening he told me I'm the one who needed to apologize for the way I went about it. I told him I'm not going to. I don't feel sorry for raising my voice. His lack of effort as a partner, his disrespect towards my efforts for everyone else, and his skewed perspective aren't flying anymore. It's day 8, and we haven't spoken since. \n\nIt doesn't matter how much you praise them, feed their specific needs based on that day, dote upon them, be the best partner they need. They will find a fucking way to try to destroy all the great parts of you. Every time I see the flash of absolute selfishness in him I recall all the times I saw his true self, and make another of the same mental note: to never, ever believe that he could really care or love another person for they way they were.

One of the reasons it took me so long to leave is because he threatened to continue spreading lies about me. He had been telling his friends, and I'm guessing anyone who would listen that I had been abusive, when in fact he had been doing the things he said I had done to him. When I unearthed this(via his friend sending me a very nasty text AS I WAS PACKING TO LEAVE) I confronted him and was told \"what is the point in telling anyone the truth if you are leaving.\" And so I stayed. And he told that single friend some half truth. He had been taking fun of my accomplishments with his friends and so now I feel like a fucking joke any time I talk about anything I'm proud of.\n\n\u200b\n\nA few weeks later he used my mother's very recent death as an excuse to continue to lie to me and I decided enough was enough. I had to save, hire movers, arrange utilities, find an apartment &amp; sign a lease in secret to get away from him.\n\nThe issue is three things: 1) my paranoid brain is worried about what he has told people about me. He displayed classic narcissistic traits so I am sure he started a smear campaign against me. 2)To hide the abuse I had to hide my feelings from my friends. I had to pretend on so many occasions I was okay when I was not so I got used to swallowing my emotions to the point that I fear expressing them to anyone, even those people who say it's okay and ask 3)He kept me extremely isolated from my friends in the 15 months we dated and so I completely lost touch of how to be vulnerable and emotionally open with people. When the only support you receive for that long includes consequences like getting screamed at, you get terrified to tell people how you feel.\n\n\u200b\n\nI guess my point of this post is to say I don't know how to be vulnerable anymore. Not with my friends or family even though I really need people right now to hear me. I feel like if I were to open up I would be a burden. I am so scared to be myself it's crippling and this feeling that people hate me makes me so anxious. I really don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I love my mum and she has always done what she can to provide for my big brother and I, but for as long as I can remember, she has treated my dad like shit most of the time and I can definitely see how it has worn him down over the years.\n\nShe will belittle him and shoot him down as often as she wants. Whether she's in a bad mood or not. Sometimes I'll be talking to her and she seems completely fine - up for a conversation, happy to chat away and I can even hear in her voice that she's feeling okay. Then my dad comes home and she turns cold...\n\nEvery single day he walks in the door after working all day long and he tries time and time again to make my mum feel loved and to show her he's happy to see her. You can genuinely hear his efforts just in the way he speaks to her, but she'll go from speaking to me in the light hearted way she usually does, to speaking to him like she just wants him gone and to make him feel small as often as she pleases. She'll do this right in front of me. If we're in the car having a nice conversation and she decides to phone my dad and tell him we're coming home, she'll suddenly turn cold and sour when he answers the phone. They won't argue, but usually they're calls end with him telling her he loves her and she'll just say goodbye and hang up. Often complaining about him afterwords when all he's done is treat her lovingly.\n\nIf I'm with her and she bumps into someone she knows, she'll speak to them in the kind, friendly way that I see her act in so often, but it's rare to see her even try to speak to my dad in the same way. I can see that it breaks his heart and it's clear as day that he's depressed and lonely.\n\nThey both work their ass off but my mum is in charge of the money they both make. She'll spend money on getting her hair done, her nails, eye brows, she'll buy clothes, shoes, bath products and whatever else, but if my dad was to come home with a \u00a35 DVD he just bought for himself, he'll have to hide it or else my mum will bitch at him and unleash her stress on to him.\n\nHe has very little recreational time to himself. He golfs 12 til half 4 on a Saturday, and 8 til 12 on a Sunday morning. Other than that, my mum would most likely stop him from doing anything else - not that he even tries these days... If she wants to drink a few glasses of wine she'll do as she pleases, but if my dad has a drink on a Saturday after the golf (literally just a couple pints of beer with his mates before he comes back home) and he walks in cheery and happy, she'll chastise him and maybe even cancel their plans for the night and tell him it's his fault because he chose to get drunk. He'll come home on time, hardly even be tipsy - not slurring his words or anything, yet she'll make a huge deal out of it like with everything else, and as usual, it's his fault.\n\nWhenever my dads sister comes up in conversation, she'll talk down about her and she'll even stop him from seeing her sometimes. He probably sees his sister about 8 times a year even though her house is a 2 minute drive from our street. It's not like he's forced to not see her, but after years of her treating him like this my mum knows exactly how to get her way in whatever way she wants. He would do anything for her and I do not say that lightly.\n\nMy dad is an amazing parent. He would give his heart and soul for his family. The same goes for my mum, but she's a really shitty wife and almost all of the time she won't show any loving kindness towards him. Sometimes she'll have a laugh with him, but still I can see that she picks and chooses when to be nice to him. It's always one sided. By this I mean that she'll sometimes speak to him with kindness in her voice, but it's only when she wants to ammuse herself and to talk to someone when no one else is there.\n\nI'm 21 years old, still living at home, and this has been going on my entire life. I didn't even consider if the way she treats him is abusive or not until about 2 years ago as this is the way it's always been in our house. Obviously there is more to it than what I've said, but I'm trying to keep this lengthy post as short as possible in the hope that someone can be bothered to read it all and leave a comment. I'm seriously worried about my dads mental health. He's miserable, treated like shit everyday, and yet he breaks his back for his family day in and day out. There's only so much a man can take and it hurts me to see my dad being beaten down time and time again. She acts as if he's hopeless and does nothing for her when he would do anything it takes to please her. Yet she takes any chance she can to bite at him and break him down.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It has been a long 30 years since the abuse ended.\nSo my story in a nutshell: my parents divorced when I was six, first memory of anything concrete/ snapshot was my mum walking out. My dad had been abusive, but like most victims she believed it to be her fault. Dad remarried a year or two later and my Stepmother (SM) was...Well not happy with the instant Brady bunch - 6 kids in total. I was the oldest girl, but was also blamed for things, most of which I had nothing to do with. I was hit until I had deep muscular bruising, told I was ugly, told I was unwanted, made to take cod liver oil as punishment, or tormented by having my mouth washed with soap. I never swore, and I was mostly a well behaved kid, did very well at school and was above my age in reading. My teacher reported the abuse to child services because I had bruises on my legs. \nI will skip details... even I'm not 100% clear on them anyhow and they feel like a ghosted image in my head. I was sent to my mum aged 9 1/2. I had run away twice, and child services were starting to investigate the home. My SM was somehow warned of an impending visit, called my mum and told her my dad had been hitting me ( not completely a lie but mostly one) and to come and collect me. She \" packed \" my stuff in rubbish bags and I went to live with my mum.\nI still don't remember clearly a lot of things but I saw a lot of specialists at the time, the damage was done and I've had back pain since then. I was also malnourished and terrified of everything.\nI'm an adult now, well and truly. I am a Christian so I have wrestled with forgiveness  and tried to be mature in how I relate to siblings and others.\nMy husband could not imagine a parent being the way I described and until he met my SM tried to get me to reconcile. So I tried, and she got angry. In actuality I had tried before that, a few times myself with the belief that family is important. Anyhow that blew up again and I had nothing to do with them for years. \nI met up with an aunt for whom the overwhelming guilt of not stopping what happened made her very apologetic towards me. I seem to get either blame or guilt from my family on this stuff. Anyhow, my SM died a couple of years ago.\nMy name was included on the gravestone (one of my brother's is not), I'm pretty sure that was for my Dad as I doubt had anyone asked her my SM would have wanted it.\nSo my problems right now?\nEveryone seems to believe my Dad and I should be fine now since SM is gone. I don't hate them but I honestly find it hard to talk to them, I don't know them, and they were not around for 70%of my life. Even as a kid dad had been not paying child support. He now complains about money etc even though I'm on disability myself. \nThat is the other thing, new problems appear medically speaking, which have the roots in the abuse /neglect. My teeth are really bad, in a way usually caused by issues with nutrition when teeth are forming. They can't say it for certainty but it's most likely. I have chronic pain from my back, but also problems with my shoulders. Every time they find something new I'm reminded of my past. \nI have learned to see things as ptsd memories, dreams etc but I honestly don't know what to do with the medical stuff, how to find a place of peace amongst it all. My mum and brother's seem to go with the idea that I'm old enough to just forget things and move on.\nI've never been the kind to shove it under a rug, I don't know if I will ever confront my dad about it, or even if I have the mental energy to do so, but I find it hard to pretend that everything is ok.\nThanks for reading my story, or the bit I've posted anyhow. Advice is always welcome.\nJ \n\n", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I knew she could be up and down emotionally. She had already blocked me and deleted me from social media loads of times. She had verbally abused me and showed how clingy she could be plus I had caught her been dishonest and using manipulative tactics. All this for a couple of years before we started dating. \n\nThe first time we met something felt off but we decided to be an item. I don't even think I was what she wanted but because of my co dependant actions and how I basically was there to do what ever she wanted she took the chance to keep this by been an item. \n\nAll of the things I listed earlier manifested into bigger issues like constant break ups and nasty insults when she was angry. She often said she liked me because I never left which confirmed that she knew most other men wouldn't put up with it. We only saw each other once per week over the 2 year period which obviously isn't ideal. \n\nThe relationship slowly became something I didn't want. She wanted to do loads of exciting stuff but she didn't work so what we could do was limited unless I financed it all but I had a son to take care off. The break ups continued and the constant need for me to give her attention. My responses to her texts were never satisfactory so I was constantly walking on egg shells. \n\nShe had said some nasty stuff when we had broke up that I just couldn't forget. Calling me ugly and grotesque. But the one I just couldn't shift was telling me she had to get drunk to sleep with me and when she did she would think of someone else. She said she didn't mean it but that damaged me. My already low self esteem was shattered. How could I be intimate with someone when they had said that? When we discussed this after she was more concerned whether I had told my mom what she had said and wasn't as concerned that it had really hurt me. \n\nI started noticing really toxic traits within her close family like verbal abuse, substance abuse, violence towards women. Her mom was in and out of relationships. She would be engaged one week then the next she would be labelling the guy as a cheat all over social media. Then engaged again the week after. It actually appeared that the mom was the one who was up to something and projecting. I wouldn't normally say that your family doesn't make you who you are but the similarities between her and her mom was unreal. My ex was always accusing me of cheating when I was 100% loyal but she was very sly about her actions. Something's she did didn't add up and I had a gut feeling she was talking to other men. She had already shown me a conversation with a guy who was known for cheating with married women. \n\nBecause I could tell the relationship was dysfunctional I managed to put off her requests for starting a family, getting engaged, moving in together. \n\nOnce she broke up with me for the 30th time I said enough was enough which was met with her calling me manipulative because I set boundaries. I said one more time and that's it. She broke up with me for the last time in October 2018 and even though she tried hoovering me back 5 times I've remained no contact. She tried saying sorry which wasn't sincere and turned into how I wasn't perfect. She then used guilt then nasty insults and more recent telling me her mom had a terminal illness and how she needed me. \n\nAfter all this I still miss her and it hurts knowing that ill never speak to her again and I have to do this for my own mental health. Does this ever get easier? I'm sure deep down she is a caring lady but her upbringing has turned her into this person who doesnt behave like most of us do.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Sorry. I'm just struggling to get past him.\n\nFirst off can someone confirm this was a narcissist I was/am dealing with. He loves posting himself on Instagram showing off his designer clothes. He loves to openly post about how great he is and basically superior to others on Instagram. In fact when I met him one of the first things he said was \"I'm not like other guys, I'm built different and I'm aggressive\". I thought maybe he was just a confident or dominant guy. \n\nLong story short I was stupid and fell for his lies. I should have been smarter. He showered me with adoration and attention in the beginning. Made great declarations about his intentions for me which was marriage and children. Said he wanted me to make us a priority. We started off long distance. But when he came home all he seemed to want was sex no dating. Then he never followed through on the things he said. I managed to ignore him and tried to move on. But he popped up at a later time and pleaded with me not to ignore him and to try again. The 2nd time was a fail again. \n\nI learned recently he has a girlfriend. He posted a photo of them together on Instagram. He enjoys liking her posts. I've stopped looking. Yet, when I went silent on him with no explanation he appeared to get angry or annoyed I was ignoring him per comments in his text to me.\n\nI recently broke down and responded to him. I gave him a lame excuse for my silence. I did that because he's returning to our old job where we met. Now I have to work together with him. Horrible. \n\nA few questions. Does this sound like a narcissist? Since I responded to him to feed his ego is he now satisfied and done with me? Or, is he maybe a regular guy who will treat his real girlfriend good and I just wasn't his type? I ask because he's made me feel less than and I am a bit jealous that he'll probably be kind to his real girlfriend.

I see the mask a little differently. I don\u2019t see a devil in a costume, I see a greedy fisherman, the beast in the boat.\n\nYour narcissist needs to fish every day, as he doesn\u2019t know how to grow his own food.\n\nYour narcissist has two personas: there is the lure in the water which is controlled by the beast in the boat. The lure is attractive, flashy and dances, and is meant to be the thing which \u201ccatches\u201d you. You hit on the lure, unaware that there is a ravenous beast waiting to pull you in to that boat. If you are a really big, juicy fish that the beast can feed on for a while, he will keep you in order to feed. But he always needs to feed, first, so you might be used as bait to catch another, even bigger fish. Or, if you are a nice juicy fish, he might show you to all his other fisherman friends, so they may envy his big, juicy catch. His appetite has no bottom, so even if you are the biggest, juiciest fish of all time he will still spend on day snacking on you while trying to catch more fish.\n\nNow, the lure may not even know that he is a lure. When you show him that he is a lure and there is a beast in the boat he might reject that information (delusions) or ask you to forget about the beast. He says this because the beast needs the lure in order to eat: its his only method, he can\u2019t grow his own food. The beast needs the lure because the fish would swim away from the beast. The beast controls the lure, and is always aware of its usefulness, sometimes to the point that he ensures that the lure isn\u2019t even aware that he is a lure. The beast knows, as he controls the lure, he just asks that you not look at the fishing line connecting the two.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

In school she told me I was gay because I only made one female friend. She told me I was stupid and not of her blood because I didn\u2019t get good grades and fell behind a lot.

I'm from the usa but married to someone from the UK. In septemeber I had the courage to finally leave my husband. He was terrible to me and I had to get out. He sent me the saddest most pathetic emails about how he just needed a kick up the ass and he'll be better. For the most part he is better in the sense that he doesn't send me abusive texts anymore, just says everything out loud to me. I'm currently covered in bruises because I told him I don't think he's ever going to change and I think it's best I go back home. He's just so angry and mean. I can't take it anymore. Last time he guilted me so badly that I came back. I feel like an idiot for coming back to him. I hate my life with him and I just want to move on before it's too late. I've already wasted 5 years of my life on this man. I know it's right but I remember the tears and promises from last time I left and I feel SO guilty", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

If my boyfriend doesn\u2019t know what this means by now, that proves that he already doesn\u2019t care about me enough to even google it.\n\nJust so it\u2019s clear:\n\n\u201cYour Tendons are designed to withstand high, repetitive loading, however, on occasions, when the load being applied to the tendon is too great, it begins to become stressed. This causes **tears**/rips and inflammation. If the load is **continually applied** to the tendon, the tendon can **exceed the rate of repair**, become worse, cause **immense pain** and dysfunction. This is known is tendinopathy \u2013 A microtrauma that appears to exceed the tendon\u2019s capacity to **heal** and remodel.\u201d\n\nMaybe I didn\u2019t make it clear \u2013 so let me try again.\n\nI felt so unwanted and unattractive in 2017- mid 2018. I destroyed my hair with dye, lost weight etc \u2013 and the psychopathic, narcissist guy I was \u2018in love\u2019 with, wasn\u2019t interested at all. In order to both make him jealous and to feel wanted by somebody, I met and let a random guy sleep around my flat. I emotionally liked him after chatting for a few days \u2013 but I was na\u00efve and unaware that he was flirting for the purpose of physical intimacy, and nothing more. I wasn\u2019t in a stable state of mind \u2013 drinking made me suicidal at this point.\n\nBut I got very drunk the night I met the random guy at a party.\n\n\u201cYou must\u2019ve been very, very drunk to not feel your tendons being ripped. It\u2019s agony. That would classify as non-consensual if you couldn\u2019t feel or weren\u2019t fully awake.\u201d \u2013 My counsellor and physiotherapist.\n\nI knew the random guy was sleeping round that night, I knew that mean sexual stuff was going to happen - and I didn\u2019t want to be present. I never do this kind of thing. I felt so gross and guilty. But I needed to do it \u2013 I didn\u2019t want to. I just needed to be needed. The Narc I loved was so manipulative to hurt me - hot, cold, push, pull, want me, reject me - it drove me crazy to always be wound up and let down. Punching my heart. Beating it up relentlessly. He never was going to love me back.\n\nThe random guy I met in order to make my Narc jealous, made out with another girl - in front of me. I should of told him he couldn\u2019t sleep over then and there. That was disrespectful to me and my feelings. Someone even TOLD him I was jealous and upset at the party, after walking off \u2013 the random guy said nothing to me. He didn\u2019t care.\n\nAs soon as we left the house, the random guy held my hand and started flirting with me again \u2013 and I was just happy to be wanted again and have his focus and attention. I felt wanted, I felt sexy. I happily forgot that he was kissing another girl 10 minutes prior. At least he wanted me\u2026at least somebody really wanted me now.\n\nSo we went back to my flat. It was awkward at first. He just asked \u201cSo\u2026wanna make out?\u201d I can\u2019t remember much else. I remember blacking in and out of consciousness \u2013 waking up to him doing stuff. I remember vaguely trying to keep closing my legs, and he would use his leg to pull mine apart. I didn\u2019t mean to shut them \u2013 I wasn\u2019t even there. My body was on autopilot. Regardless, he kept pulling my legs open, too wide, and then forcefully using his hands on me, not that I felt it. I remember feeling sharp pain at points, through the drunken haze. But I gritted my teeth and told myself: *Deal with it.*\n\nIn the morning, whilst still sleepy and drunk, we did some stuff again. I can\u2019t remember this at all. After, we watch Netflix and I cook him food. He gets rude.  He takes offence. He says bitterly\u2026.\u201dOh. Most girls instantly fall in love with me.\u201d He suddenly becomes interested in me AFTER I tell him I have no interest in him, but wasn't interested when I show I clearly like him. Alarm bells: this guy has issues. It\u2019s a classic. But I don\u2019t see it at the time. I do now. I see it in many guys I\u2019ve previously liked.\n\nHe leaves. I feel bruised pain in my groin, that gets worse throughout the day. I suddenly realise how unsafe I was \u2013 I got to a sexual health clinic to get checked the same day.\n\nOver the next few days, the pain gets worse. It gets to the point I can no longer stand or walk. I\u2019m in constant agony. I can\u2019t cook, I collapse at work, I collapse alone on the street\u20261 step forward becomes absolutely impossible. I just fall, and my legs don\u2019t work any more. I\u2019m terrified \u2013 something is very, very wrong. Why can\u2019t I walk? What\u2019s going on??? Is it an STD? Pregnant? I don\u2019t know. My paranoia gets insane. I can't emphasise this.\n\nI go to A&amp;E about 6 times in total, none of the doctors wanting to see me. It wasn\u2019t until the 6th visit, with my sister, that a nurse was watching me curdled over the chair in pain in her A&amp;E room. She says \u201cI can see how much agony you\u2019re in. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d Later, she happily informs me the doctors will see me. I\u2019ll finally know what\u2019s wrong.\n\nGosh. The most painful thing in my whole life.\n\nThe doctors had to insert an endoscope up to my womb \u2013 with no pain killers or gas. There was numbing gel, but that did nothing. I was SCREAMING at the doctors to stop, but they couldn\u2019t yet.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re moving around too much. If you don\u2019t lay still, we can\u2019t see\u201d the doctor says sternly. I\u2019m crying. But I\u2019m scared to not know what\u2019s wrong. I let them try again. I do my best to not move \u2013 but it\u2019s not possible. My body was moving on its own. My sister tried to calm me down. All I could do, was say the first things that came to my brain \u2013 word flew out my mouth. The psychopathic, narcissist guy I was \u2018in love\u2019 with was always on my mind, even when I was in this painful situation,even though he didn't even cause my injury. I was obsessed with my Narc toxically, even though his emotional abuse was the reason I went with a random guy and ended up here in A&amp;E. So I screamed in front of the doctors and my sister: *The guy I\u2019m talking to - he\u2019s abusive, but he doesn\u2019t mean it.*\n\nI didn\u2019t **ever** mean to say that out loud. The doctors finally stop. I look at everyone\u2019s faces:\n\nThe doctors, my sister \u2013 they are all looking at me with such sad expressions. They feel very sorry for me. But nobody says anything about my commentary. No help is offered.\n\nThe doctor says \u201cI can see a tear on the womb. He must\u2019ve cut you with his nails. This is one of the **most sensitive** and **painful** parts of the female body.\"\n\nI can\u2019t move. The doctors tell me to sit up but I\u2019m not really there. They give me drugs. I get very floaty and high, which is okay. I can feel the agony, but my sister says \u201cConcentrate on the high.\u201d So for brief, tiny seconds, I\u2019m out of pain. It\u2019s so worth it. But I\u2019m so upset, because I know the pain will be back. It *always* is.\n\nIt takes the **whole** summer holiday of staying in bed, which allows my tears to begin to heal.  This was horrible....I was in pain and highly depressed, and was planning to drop out of uni due to my depression and agony.\n\nAfter many weeks of agony, I am finally able to stand again. I go to a few physiotherapy places to get diagnosed with Abductor Tendinopathy, about **4 whole months** after the night I received the injury. Not knowing what was wrong for that long...was **terrifying**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am able to go back to uni. I'm not the same, and I don't work hard like I used to. I have no motivation. Unfortunately, my trip to Thailand was cancelled the night prior, and I was unable to work. This caused me money stress.\n\nThe psychopathic, narcissist guy I was \u2018in love\u2019 with didn\u2019t care what happened to me \u2013 he made everything feel 100 times worse. But when he often lied about being in A&amp;E for being attacked on the street (in reality, he cut himself with a smashed bottle at 5am now and then and would send the photos to me), I was by his side. Even though I was the one *actually* in and out of hospitals.\n\n*I\u2019d rather be alone, than have someone next to me, not caring. It\u2019s so much worse.*\n\nIt\u2019s now been 7 months or so, I can\u2019t recall. I can walk and stand, but I am always in pain. Some days are terrible, some are okay. But It never fully goes away. I can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s like to not be in this much pain all the time \u2013 hence why I don\u2019t show it or talk about it. I\u2019m very used to this way of life now.\n\nIt makes me want to give up, knowing that I may not even be half-way through recovery. I\u2019ll be graduated, and still unable to walk. I\u2019ll be trying to get a job, that can\u2019t involve standing. My options are limited. I\u2019m so sick of this. And the random person who done it \u2013 doesn\u2019t care. He knows full well what\u2019s happened, I\u2019ve told him. And he just says \u201cSorry, get well, when are you next free baby haha .\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s fucked up.\n\nWhy did my boyfriend make jokes and not take my upset seriously by speaking with the random guy this week like it's nothing?\n\nIs my boyfriend immature? Did I not explain it right? How do I make him understand something he's never had happen to him?\n\nMy boyfriend made me feel that I was in the wrong, or that I\u2019m \"being overdramatic.\" But\u2026I\u2019m not. Am I? What\u2019s happened to me is horrendous. Nobody, not even my boyfriend, can understand that. I feel bad enough, I\u2019ve been through enough.\n\nMy boyfriend is the only person who ever saw me collapse.\n\nI usually collapsed away from my work colleges, or down a street where nobody could see me.\n\nMy boyfriend is the only one who saw. And he helped me. So I trusted him.\n\nMy boyfriend said the night I collapsed after a few drinks: \u201cI\u2019ll kill the guy that did this to you\u201d, after he\u2019d carried me safely home all by himself.\n\nBut when the time came, when the random guy who caused all this pain and collapsing messaged me, my boyfriend just joked around, and wanted to \u2018defuse the situation\u2019 by making friendly chat with him. I told you he made me feel mentally bad. It made me remember how long ago that night was \u2013 and how all this time later, I still can\u2019t walk painlessly. And he lived happily whilst I didn\u2019t. The random guy who caused my injury said sorry\u2026but I don\u2019t feel he means it. If I knew I caused someone this much pain and grief \u2013 I would do and say SO much more to help. Not just \u201cOh, sorry about that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not about defusing, I want to tell my boyfriend. Look what this man has done to my body. I thought out of everyone, anyone \u2013 my boyfriend would understand.\n\nThe random guy isn\u2019t sorry. I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s dodgey when it comes to women \u2013 there\u2019s rumours. He\u2019s done nothing to make this easier for me, he\u2019s just **ghosted** me.\n\nUntil word is out I have a boyfriend now \u2013 then he\u2019s interested in me again. Despite knowing I still (1 year later) still can't walk properly because of **him**. When I show I\u2019m not interested, THEN he wants me. He messaged me out of nowhere after like 4 months of no talking or interaction at ALL. It\u2019s not a coincidence. Birds of the same feather with my Narc. I just couldn't see it 1 year ago.\n\n**Nobody understands** the physical pain and mental trauma this has been. I hope you never understand it for yourself. I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m here. But this level of physical pain, at this age, for this constantly long time, just isn\u2019t right.\n\nI\u2019m not being overdramatic. I couldn\u2019t WALK. I\u2019m in CONSTANT pain and it PROHIBITS me from living a normal life. How am I meant to work after I graduate? I\u2019m doing a degree whilst in this pain. I feel sorry for myself, but to be honest, after all this \u2013 I think it\u2019s deserved. Just this once.\n\nMy Boyfriend just didn\u2019t ever take the time to understand.\n\nI wake him up every day because he can\u2019t get himself up. I make sure he gets up, and lives his life.\n\nMy boyfriend don\u2019t motivate or remind me to do my physio every other day, despite knowing I don\u2019t do it \u2013 because it hurts so much. I need encouragement and support, just like he gets mine.\n\nI am forever conscious and paranoid about my boyfriends needs and satisfaction, and always remember to take care of him. I check to make sure he\u2019s happy \u2013 he always is.\n\nI don't feel he tries to do the same for me.\n\nIs it wrong of me to expect my boyfriend to understand something that's never happened to him?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate: Last I heard, my narcissistic 'ex' has been in lots of fights due to his words and treatment towards people he meets, physically attacked his (now ex) friends and has nobody left, and...well... it's not justice, but at least more people are free from him now. I hope he'll get the help he needs to be happy and safe to be around others and himself one day. He is a product of his own environment - but **my mistake was accepting this as an excuse to mistreat me**. Empathise, but protect yourself too. I feel sorry for him, but I can't save him.

The thing is, I've recently just learned about \"empath\" as a spectrum and I may not have been very thorough about it. I keep encountering the word here. In my understanding, empathy is one thing (which of course, does not flow in the very veins of the Nexes or the sociopaths/ASPDs we've encountered in our lives), and being an \"empath\" is another thing. I read on it like it almost seem as a superpower which is kinda funny. So, I am wondering if it's a legitimate category with a science behind it or whether it's just a \"science fiction\", as I quote Google *\"(chiefly in science fiction) a person with the paranormal ability to apprehend the mental or emotional state of another individual.\"* I still can't figure out if it's backed-up with research even after reading about this study of Judith Orloff MD.

It's come to light that my partner is a narcissist. It's so very confusing and Im starting to question my own reality and everything I know about our relationship. \nSince I've started reading about narcissistic abuse I have started to see so much more into the person my partner is. And one thing I'm adamant he does is gaslight. In very subtle but significant ways and it's usually only in an argument. This is the example that happened today but it happens at least once or twice a week and I think before I just used to submit and believe that he was right and I must have forgot what I said or did. \n\nSo we were playing some magic the gathering which is what we play to relax. To try and cut a long story short I went to the attack step of the game and was unsure whether to attack with both creatures or just one and I saw he went to respond to me attacking which made me only attack with one creature as I thought he might be able to respond to both. (Sorry if this doesn't make much sense if you haven't played the game before!) Anyway, I then asked after my turn had finished if he could wait until I've declared my attackers for him to respond to me and I was instantly met by him shouting \"well I did, you didn't want to attack with that one\" it then became heated because I said well I nearly did and I didn't because you were responding and he tried to convince me that that wasn't what happened and he did wait and what I thought didn't happen. But then I sat there for a minute and realised actually I had that thought because of his actions and there was no way that I could have misremembered that! But then I stood up to him and told him that my thought process was valid and I wasn't criticising him just pointing it out but at that point he started screaming and punching the table. I left the room and when he came to see me he told me that I'm trying to make him crazy and I'm manipulative and he's leaving now and again I stayed calm and tried to explain and he just shut me out and walked out the house. \n\nI'm sorry that was so long winded but these small to large arguments happen so often and I've started to realise that he tells me what I'm thinking or thought so often that it's made me disassociate to the point I'm not sure who me or my friends and family are. I never realised there was a connection but I can see my mental health is so strongly connected to his behaviour. Help please!

Early on, I was so desperate because my mother had already died and I had no other family, no job, and severe anxiety that I was extremely comforted by him cuddling with me and, yes, rocking me like a baby. The weirdest it got was that he would go on and sing me lullabies every night. I asked him when he began rocking me if that was okay. He is a Psychologist, although he works in HRs. He told me that \"it is a bit strange, but sometimes people need things like this\". \nAnyways, my only family member (the only one in my family circle left), my aunt, was out of the country and for political reasons we had to move out of the country and she had found a way for us to do it legally. \n\nI thought then that we would start a new life, with more opportunities and safety, but I didn't know what was coming. My aunt paid for our plane tickets and our paperworks, and as soon as we were here, we had to live together for six months together, without being able to work. He told me that everything would be okay, that he would fix everything and he promised me that my panic attacks would be gone by the end of the year and I would be cured of my GAD. Completely cured. I believed every word, but when we got here I began to see a new therapist, in a different language. As soon as I went to therapy, things got really mean. He began yelling at me for anything. For not being able to sleep because I woke up with terryfing nightmares for asking him for the same things that he kept doing back in our home country, that he ingrained in my behavior even if I knew it was sick. But it wasn't that bad. Then we discussed about marriage, because I knew that I was not in the right place to do something like this, but \"under the spell\", he told me, after me asking him, as his training and my own knowledge back then, that I was NOT ready even if I really wanted to. I asked him several times, \"What if my anxiety gets worse? Are you willing to deal with that for the rest of your life\"\n\nAnd he would say yes, absolutely, because I was the light of his life and so on. I asked him several times and I told him that my mom died still loving my already gone father, and that even if I'm not religious (I come a very religious country) and he was neither, but that precisely because of that I had to keep the legacy of my mother and if I married it would be the real deal, like my mother. He was aware of all of that. So we got married and one of the reasons why it hurts so much is because he not only made me her pet, but he began a cycle of throwing tantrums or wallstoned me with every minor stress that I could cause him because, I was, and I am, sick with GAD. \nAnyways, this is too painful to tell in all in just one post, but he left me in New Year's Day a two year ago, he kept me hidden from his family (because of my illness) and then blamed me for it, he gaslighted me, which made my panic attacks worse, and when it was too much, he would just go back to the \"daddy\" mode and be sweet and caring and loving and fucking weird. This went on and on for months, until I told him that I wanted to die, and then he told me that I MADE him want to die, I couldn't take it anymore and failed to OD shortly before Christmas.\nThe day before he left me, I asked him if he would ever leave me, I was horrified. He told and promised me for \"what was most sacred for him\" that it wouldn't happen, and he repeated the same thing he always said, told me that my ex, who also left before New year's, was a dumbass child that didn't know what he wanted with his life. I knew how toxic everything was, but we had just came from a trip to bury the ashes of my mom where he met my family, and that day he walked away because I wanted to take a picture of the both of us in the favorite place in the world of my mom. He accused me of \"pushing him\" and \"forcing him\" to take a picture of us. \nHe literally pushed me to the ground and then told me that I fell.\n\n\nAnyways. It has been 2 years since he has gone. I have no family nor friends left. I am completely drained. My aunt supported us financially until he got a good job and not a month passed he left for good. I try not to contact him, but I feel like there should be some law against this type of abuse. My SAD is even worse than before and it's been two years and I don't trust a soul.\n\nHe went with his co-workers and number who knows girlfriend to that same roadtrip, and I really feel like I have had enough of this, I will never be able to function again, I won't be able to trust anyone and it's been two years already. \n\nPlease excuse grammar, English is not my primary language.\n[Edit: typos]", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

You see, I wanted to gather information on what it means to be a narcissist. I see stories on here and I can compare mine to many on here. \n\nI'm a guy, I'm 27. My ex is 30. You see we had a great beginning, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't see any red flags. I chose to turn my eyes away from them because I loved how happy I felt in the beginning of it all. This is just a short take of what it was like. Now moving on...\n\nYou see, my ex had this thing where she'd do fucked up shit, knowing it's fully wrong. I'd get pissed and confront her about it about and then she'd justify it by saying I equally did wrong things, which I did not do. I'll give a couple of examples. \n\nOkay so I found out from direct paperwork that she could not get pregnant. She lacked ovaries. This was a topic that was shared amongst her family members and friends, and I've heard this with my ears quite a few times. So I fully knew this and if I wasn't certain, I wouldn't bring this up. \n\nSo, one night, we was driving and she asked me what I'd do if I found out she was pregnant. I know this will come off as a dick headed response, but I told her I'd ask for a DNA test. This happened about 3 months into our relationship, so it's natural I'd say this. I did't fully know her or what she's capable of then, so I answered that because that's simply what any sane person would request. She freaked out on me and it lead to an argument instantaneously. She called me names such as \"asshole\", \"dickhead\" and alot more. Said something about I can already see where this would go. Naturally this upset me, so I didn't lose my sense of composure, I just shifted in silence. \n\nAnother one. She told me that she was invited to go hangout with her ex on his boat at a little party I guess. I tried to don the mask of not caring because I didn't want to come off as a controlling person, but deep inside it affected me and she like kept bringing this up multiple times in odd ways. I finally gave in and told her that if she does this, I cannot guarantee our relationship anymore, then she tries to tell me that's the reaction she was looking for. Like it was some fucking test. Again this kinda set me off, and I'll admit it here, it caused me to initiate the argument by asking her if she knew I wouldn't like it, then why would she do it?\n\nHere's another. She always told me what I needed to do in my life. And I get that I was in a hole at that time, I didn't exactly have it all together. College stressed me out, my health and anxiety peaked so bad that it made me stop because I honestly don't like being in crowds. It puts me on edge and I don't like that feeling. I know it's stupid, but I seeked help. I was talking to my doctor about these problems and we was working through things to make it better. \n\nMy ex though, she wasn't having that. She'd complain that I'm taking too long to correct my life. Maybe I could've tried to make it faster, but then again, somethings in life are not in your hands. She had problems a little higher on the scale. She was addicted to pills and all kinds of crazy stuff, yet I never felt the need to tell her what to do. I thought things like that, you just kinda work on together as a couple. \n\nHere's my favorite one. She cheated on me. It was revealed that she was in the middle of a divorce while we we're dating. Naturally this set off the \"oh fuck no\" alarm and I lost my shit. I got texts from her ex husband of them two sexting at a date that falls in our relationship timeline. So yeah, I was quite pissed. I immediately messaged her the screenshots and told her to not message me ever again. She spent a week dude, a week of her spamming apology messages. I gave in and forgave her. Yeah, I tried to be good and be optimistic, but I was naive so... I guess I'm only a human. \n\nLater on, she would decide that she was in the relationship and then decide we we're friends with benefits. This was so she can justify herself when she would go out and presumably cheat. Which she did. I found out that there was another ex of hers in the fray. Apparently this guy used to abuse her and she left me for him in the end. \n\nShe called me a narcissist once because she did the things she did because I was an asshole. The truth was that I was very kind to her. I was only an asshole when she did the things she did. I always told her that the side of me you'll see is dependent on you. She told me and others that I was the one who got away after the relationship. \n\nSo, my problem is, am I the narcissist? Was I a bad person because I reacted like an asshole when she did bad things? What does it fully mean to be a narcissist? Am I questioning this stuff because that's what they do or am I questioning my gut, my senses?\n\nTL:DR... My ex did alot of terrible things and made my life a living hell. She'd justify her behavior because I was apparently the bad guy. It wasn't true, so I come to ask you all for information on what it means to be a narcissist, and to ask you all if I was one or was she? I'm terribly sorry for the long read!

I also thought about any sort of scenario where I was a victim and would be saved in some way by preferably a man (illness, car accident, injury etc.). I\u2019m not sure if this makes any sense...\n\nEven worse, I would sexually experience with my twin sister when we were children and I have never admitted this before or even talked to anyone about this (her included) but we would play weird games with our friend as well which had some sort of sexual aspect to it.\n\nI\u2019m just very confused by my childhood and was kind of hoping that somebody here could relate or help me figure out why I have such negative and limited memories from my childhood. Could it be that I might have experienced some sort of trauma early in my childhood and am repressing it? Or is it maybe that I\u2019m just an unusually weird person with disgusting thoughts? I don\u2019t know... sorry for the long post.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Every time I think I\u2019m getting better, something happens. Especially when I saw with my own eyes that she was already dating someone else. I knew she\u2019d date someone else eventually but it still hits like a truck when you confirm it yourself. \n\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting when everyday your mind ruminates and asks the same questions: how can she betray me? How can she move on so quickly? How can she abuse me and backstab me? Same questions over and over again and everyday I give myself the same answers hoping that I\u2019d finally listen and fully accept the reality of what happened. Everyday my thoughts stray to her and everyday I comfort myself. I\u2019m tired. But I have to keep fighting because no one else will.\n\n\nIt\u2019s weird how doing something counter-intuitive is the right thing to do. When someone hurts you, you\u2019ll want justice for it right? She hurt me, she shouldn\u2019t get away with it. And yet here I am telling myself to let go. Letting go doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve been defeated. We all know narcs will never apologise. In their world they\u2019re never wrong. And if they do apologise, will that make them magically change? Will it erase all the pain they\u2019ve caused? Will they change to the person you thought you knew and loved? No. So say you went ahead and sought \u201cjustice,\u201d everyone knows what they did to you. Will it change anything? Will that make them a normal person? No. I\u2019m the only one who keeps on hating and I\u2019m hurting myself because of it. She will never grant me closure and I will never find it in her. I know I have to find by in me, by myself. It\u2019s over when I learn to let go and accept that it happened and that it\u2019s over. If she lasts longer with the new supply, if she appears happier...it doesn\u2019t mean that I was lacking . It\u2019s not my fault that she didn\u2019t see my worth. My love for her was second to none, unconditional. But I should know that even if I give her the world, she\u2019ll only see trash. There\u2019s nothing I can do to change that. \n\n\nLetting go doesn\u2019t mean I surrender. Letting go means letting go of all the negative feelings so I can have space for positive ones. I can\u2019t be truly happy if I keep getting triggered by the past. It\u2019s a long road but I know I need to keep moving. I know it sounds preachy. I mean I sound like a broken record everyday when I talk to myself, trying to convince myself that I should let go and move on. I need to do it because nobody else will. Whenever I think of her I feel intense hate and sadness and soon after I\u2019m filled with negative emotions. I need to let go of all negativity so I can hope to one day fill myself of positive feelings, just like how I was before I met her. I want to be happy. I want to have peace of mind. I want to be ready when someone new comes along, someone better...someone who\u2019s not her.  \n\n\nI\u2019m not there yet but I know I\u2019ll get there. We\u2019ll all get there. We deserve it. We deserve better.  ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We came home last Wednesday. After seeing the deterioration (and we all knew it would happen) I went on the offensive this morning. So, lovely husband has been ditching work since we came back. I sat him down this morning and chewed him out. I said that he needs to work, and can\u2019t be rushing home all the time to make sure I am still there, **thats controlling and abusive behaviour!** Lol he called it \u201csmothering\u201d. \n\nSo, I chewed him out. I also reminded him that if he thinks he has eyes on me, whooo boy, does he also not realize that I have have six other pairs of eyes on me? That hit him hard. I gave him the business about making his whole work place suffer because he is having a bad day, and that he needs to handle his shit. Then, for good measure I added that I was having coffee with a friend (who happens to have the same name as his daughter, the one I raised more than him, ffs). He asked for clarification and I said it was my friend, but I put that seed there on purpose. Until last week I would not have \u201cbeen allowed\u201d to have a coffe with a friend. Yup, that shit stopped when we came home; I be going and he be handling it, period. \n\nI am a weird one, I know, but when I told him I was done I meant it. I have zero quarter for his bullshit, and I directly and forcefully confront him, without resorting to abusive language myself. I look him dead in the eye and tell him his bullshit isn\u2019t welcome here.  This stuff isn\u2019t for the faint of heart, you need to be internally aware that you are, indeed, more powerful than this creature before you (I don\u2019t actually believe any of this shit, I think people are the same, but narc husband doesn\u2019t. I am simply speaking his language). \n\nKnowing my husband he will find another fishing hole, as he finally figures out that I am not doing this crap anymore. I have seen his notion of revenge, and I can handle it just fine, even laugh it off (he will move on to another woman quickly, someone sexier, as he is sex obsessed. Have at it, bud!)\n\nAnyways, I was the stomper today and he was the stompee. So sick of this crap, but will continue playing his game until he leaves out of frustration or for his work trip, when he will be served and the security codes changed.

He loved my younger sister and treated her like a princess... But me, I never really lived up to what he wanted. More than that he hated himself and his failed career, and took it out on me.\n\nUntil I left for college, I was constantly anxious and tried never to go home, living with friends pretty much all the time.\n\nWhen home, I would never know what would set him off. I could walk into the house and close the door, but if he decided is shut the door too hard, he would go crazy. I would stand there for what felt like hours in one spot while he yelled at me, afraid to move my feet because I thought doing so would piss him off even more. Or crying, blinking even. I never knew what I would do to set him off and found myself getting in \"trouble\" all the time.\n\nWhhe he hit me, he would do so after a long time of screaming at me, and would slap, punch or kick me. He would routinely say he hated me and wished I was never born. He once put a knife to my throat, and once drove me to school going 60mph in small street screaming that he's going to kill both of us because he felt my tone I spoke to my mother in had attitude in it.\n\nAfter college I started a business online and became successful. That's when he changed and suddenly treated me like his son. But when I had financial problems at on epoint, he started to treat me like shit once again. I learned that I had to be successful in business and money if I ever wanted his love.\n\nYears later I got married and went to intense therapy to learn that real love is unconditional and the only way to survive is to never see of talk to my parents again... Including my mother who never hit me but let my father do whatever he wanted... Not because she was afraid, she wasn't. She condoned it for some reason.\n\nAs an adult I can't function without medication of any kind. I am constantly nervous and anxious my whole world will fall apart. My heart always pounds and my hands are sweaty. I wake up randomly all the time and if I hear any kind of male voice yelling while I'm at the grocery store, I freeze up and start looking for an exit. The problems are endless and I am tormented all the time.\n\nWhen people say life is great, it makes no sense to me. It boggles my mind that phrase. Wits so hard for me to be happy and everything is conditional now. The way my mind works is really messed up and I know this. \n\nPeople say you have to be thick skinned. Well I feel like I have no skin at all and never have. \n\nMy question is this. Has anyone suffered similar issues with their fathers and how did you cope with it as an adult?\n\nIt seems like these problems started getting worse AFTER I decided to go No Contact with my parents... Which makes no sense I thought it would be easier to say goodbye to my lifelong abused but why had it made me so much worse to not have him in my life?

I've really struggled after the end of my relationship on what I could have done, if it really was my behavior that cause the problems in our marriage. Finding these entries made everything so clear. Although, I am sad to say that I stayed 4 more years in the marriage...until he discarded me during cancer. It seems I had some clarity at the time that I needed to leave. I'm not sure why I stayed because this behavior continued intermittently throughout our marriage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a reference, at the time we had an 18 month old and had been married for 3 years.   \n\n\n**July 19, 2012**\n\nM texted me around 6:20 to tell me he was going to have one more beer at the bar and then come home. He did not give me any advance warning that he was going to be late.  He did not actually come home until 7:30 pm. In the middle of V\u2019s bedtime routine, which caused a disturbance. V and I had a quiet peaceful evening up until that point. I had been trying to get her to help clean up her mess, but once M was home it was impossible. He started telling that Mommy was throwing a tantrum, even though I did not raise raise my voice. I grabbed V away from him and went to her room where I read her a few books and put her to bed. When I came out of the room M said he was done and that he was filing for divorce. Later I tried to talk to him. I asked him to go to counseling (again) but he refused. He started going on and on about how I never compromise and he always does. I asked him what he felt he has compromised on and he would not say. He also told me that he does not know where I get my sense of entitlement. Still confused on that one. I tried to talk to him about how I feel. How I feel unloved and uncared about because he never talks to me and we haven\u2019t had sex in over 2 years. His response? \u201cDo you ever wonder why?\u201d What an ass. The issue is that M does either not realize or doesn\u2019t care about how he treats people. He says mean, hurtful things all the time and when I react in a negative way, he places all the blame on me. I\u2019m tired of it. For the past few days I have been crying every morning. There is no love in this marriage. There is no marriage. The best I can do now is hold on and get all my financials in order. At this time I cannot live on my own with V. I just have to hang on and make the best of things. I will be using this journal to document every negative interaction from now on.\n\n**July 20, 2012**\n\nHere it is 5:30 on a Friday and I have no idea when M will be home for dinner. The last email he sent me around 4 pm was sent from his iPad, so I can only guess that he is at the bar. He knew I got off at 2 pm and was picking up V. He chooses to be at the bar instead of home with his family. Also, that is 2 nights in a row at the bar. Why? Why does he feel the need to go to the bar so much and waste his money getting drunk. I do not look forward to the state he will be in when he comes home...\n\nAt 6 pm he finally waltzes through the door...with his mother. No warning, no nothing. I have to say I was a little pissed  off, but i kept all comments to myself. \n\nLater in the evening we were chatting a bit and it was clear to me that nothing is ever going to change in this relationship. In fact, he even said to me that he is normal and I am not. Which is funny, because when I tell others some of the things he says and does, they are often taken aback. Basically, he flat out lied this morning when he said he would work on things (as I suspected). He basically believes he is some sort of saint to live with. Again, I am left to believe there is no hope in this marriage. I cannot continue to live the rest of my life with someone who cannot admit his own fault and constantly talks down and belittles his wife. \n\n20 minutes later he comes up to me while I am researching stuff on my computer. He asks what I am looking up. I say stuff. He replies, You\u2019re just crying? and walks away. Seriously this is the type of sh\\*t I deal with on a daily basis.

I had a feeling that she'd come out of there after projecting her mess on me or distorting reality and say I was the bad one or something. Or she'd use it as a way to keep me there by saying \"I'm going to therapy. I'm really trying!\" As she continued to abuse me. That was my assumption.  So I got out before that situation set in.\n\nI messed up and broke no contact yesterday after being no contact for 1 week. I was triggered(I have c-ptsd) bc I forgot to delete her Facebook messages when I blocked her and I saw her profile pic and just lost it. Her banner said \"you are enough\"... And I took that as if I'd treated her in a way that made her feel she wasn't when it was heavily the other way around. But upon talking to her.. things didn't go that bad. Even though a few times she still showed signs of blame and didn't take responsibility. Like saying I didn't see her for who she really was.. but she was doing death threats and physically and emotionally abusing me so I'm not sure how I was supposed to view her but she didn't consider that at all. So there was a red flag or two... But she said that wasn't why she posted that as her banner. Who knows though. \n\nShe then goes into therapy. And the therapist says our relationship is toxic (duh) and us talking is a mistake. I agree of course. And me being triggered and sending her messages reminding her that she was abusive and that's the entire reason I began behaving that way to begin with was toxic and would hurt her growth. I understand that. And agree. It was toxic. All communication between us is really and I broke no contact. But I'm also the one who initiated no contact so obviously I'm aware. \n\nBut she comes out of there and texts me that we shouldn't talk anymore. And is callous and rude even though at this point I had already apologized 3 times and said we'd go back to no contact but I needed the closure that day(since I never got it) and I wouldn't message her again. The closure that this person is a mature adult and can admit their mistakes and their abusive behavior as well as seeing your problem behavior. Balance and understanding and a quiet ending. I know I lost myself and am my worst self with her. No doubt. But I used to go crazy that she didn't see or denied everything and acted like I was just never happy and it was my fault. And this was really similar. So I slipped up. But surprisingly she did provide that closure to some extent. I didn't agree with everything but she did take some responsibility and said she was changing and getting better and us not talking was best. I was skeptical but it's not my business and I got the closure I always hoped for and was ready to lay it to rest. \n\nWhat interests me, is how she tried to tell me I was unaware of my own unhealthy habits (many of which she literally created) and she was \"afraid\" for me that I wouldn't get better if I didn't start admitting my errors and unhealthy behavior. And was very much putting herself on a pedestal despite everything she'd done herself. And said she didn't like how I'd made her feel and the relationship was never easy like it should have been? When I was literally a slave for the first year. But blah blah.. basically.. she took this stance of superiority... Like I was so bad and toxic for HER and that I ruin her life and that I lack introspection and self awareness (even though I analyzed myself to her several times and said we are bad for each other and I can't get better while I'm with my her months ago(my abuser)). As if I was the sick and unhealthy one and I was beyond help. So I just blow it off and basically say goodbye in a very nice way. She sends me a video of her cat and jokes randomly right after that.... Rather than saying goodbye. And this morning I sent her a long text that was nothing but apologetic and even thankful for her providing me that closure and saying goodbye. And she responded in saying that those long messages are toxic and she will no longer participate in them? But that message wasnt at all toxic... Is this typical? To pretend to be healthy and better than the person they tore apart and broke? Taking this stance of superiority? With the red flags and then this it just kind of seems like that's what is occurring. \n\n\nTLDR: Narc actually admitted to the abuse and seemed genuine about it unlike previous times when they just apologized to get me to come back and then continued the abuse. They also said they knew they had been unhealthy but they are getting better now with therapy. Then said they were afraid for me because I would never be in a healthy relationship if I didn't see the error in my ways (I've openly admitted my issues many times and know I can't heal while communication is there between us) and said I'd ruin their life if we continued talking and that they didn't like how I'd made them feel throughout the relationship and how the relationship wasn't easy when it should've been.... Do narcs come from therapy with a sense of superiority as if now they are amazing and different and you're just sad and sick and they can't be around you bc you're toxic and bad for them and implying that they're getting better but you won't etc?

He is doing a damn good effort though.  So about a few months ago he was looking real close at my female parts (he is a doctor, so of course he knows everything) and indicated that a scar looked like herpes.  We were being intimate so I immediately felt self-conscious and gross about myself.  He loves to make me feel bad about having had sex with other men prior to him, like how dare I.  So to spite him I went and did a full panel std check just to show him I didn't have herpes, not thinking about anything else.  I tested for all the bacterial stuff while we started dating in the beginning and we were both already negative and had already been intimate.  And I find out today that I have chlamydia.  And we both started having weird symptoms a few weeks ago and he started getting real paranoid.  Going through all my stuff, accusing me of cheating, and saying he would forgive me if I did.  LOL.  So the sad truth is he must have cheated.  Science doesn't lie and bacteria doesn't appear without a source. He keeps trying to say it must have been me.  And of course I know it wasn't.  I am way too enamored to even think about anyone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI reached out to his ex and she of course said that he abused and cheated on her too.

He only remembered because he was going through my emails and saw a birthday coupon in my email.  He has told me I deserve to be raped, punched walls, and been getting treated like a king while I do everything for him.  I do his laundry, cook all the food, pick up after him, and tell him every day how much I love him.  His ex told me too he called a few weeks ago and said he loves us both, but her more.  I am a FUCKING IDIOT.  It is time to be done.  I can't ignore the results anymore.  I can forgive a lot of things, but cheating on me isn't one of them.  And we all know narcissists.

(I'm 26.) He slowly gained control over nearly every aspect of my life, tried to blackmail me into a sexual relationship with him and when I escaped after refusing him, he followed me thousands of miles to break into my mom's house to find me. He has connections with the mob and a lawyer friend of mine recently hypothesized that he was planning on kidnapping me and taking me back to his country. It's still hard to wrap my head around.\n\nEven 5 months out, he still sends me multiple emails every day. They've gotten creepier and creepier. He'll send me pictures he's somehow found of me as a teenager without any subject in the email. He'll send quotes from my dad's blog when he had cancer 10 years ago, trying to say he understands now why I'm so screwed up. A couple months ago he pretended to be the founder of a major org, saying that the narc was an excellent man and he was sorry there were such deep misunderstandings between us... but the idiot sent it from his personal email. And also that person doesn't even exist; he literally just made him up. Still not sure if that was some super creepy hint that he's crazier than I thought and I should watch my step, or that he's just an idiot. I'm sticking with the latter because I've seen that repeatedly demonstrated.\n\nAnyway. This summer he was paid $20,000 by an influential businessman from Asia to help him get experimental treatment for a rare disease he has. It was his last hope before his disease consumed his life. The narc asked me to help with uploading certain documents to the treatment clinic, which I informally agreed to do. When I escaped, uploading those documents was the last thing on my mind, and I knew it would be easy for anyone with a laptop to help the guy. He went on to furiously hold me responsible for the situation, saying that ONLY I of all people in the world could upload certain files and if this man died it would be my fault. I knew it was bullshit because all he'd have to do was make a couple of calls and ask someone under the age of forty to help him upload the files, since he's technologically illiterate. He can't even unzip a file, and doesn't bother to consult Google about it. And he'd gotten $20K to do just that. But I just got an email last week in my spam folder with the subject line that this man had died. I didn't read it, because I knew it was pointless to do so and I already knew the contents. Of course the narc could have been lying, but he's not generally smart enough to think up lies like that. I changed my email so he can't reach me anymore. I've documented enough of his madness to protect myself.\n\nBut yeah, wow. Apparently he was willing to let this guy die in the hopes that it would guilt trip me into coming and living with him. Who the hell is that sick?\n\nI have to admit, some of the old guilt hooks were tugging at me again. I used to be a really kind person who loved to help anyone I came across, and some of that was getting stirred up in me again with this. But I just had to point out to myself over and over that it's bullshit. I had to hear my friends and family say that it was bullshit, and that he's crazy. He possibly let a man die in the hopes of gaining control over me. Only a very, very sick person does that. I am not responsible for him not making a few calls in order to save a man's life. But still. It hurt. But it's bullshit so I'm not going to waste any more of my time hurting over bullshit.\n\nTLDR: Narc took responsibility for saving a dying man's life; accused me of letting this man die when I escaped from the narc after said narc tried to blackmail me into a relationship with him.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have a sister and a brother, and my parents are married. Since I was a child, my father has been abusive. From locking us in our rooms and denying us food, to physically abusing us by throwing things and hitting us. Lately, things have gotten a lot worse.\nMy mom has a decent job and we fully depend on her for cash flow. My dad is on unemployment and disability due to back problems.\nMy sister moved out of the house and is living with her boyfriend.\nWe live in Michigan, where it snows quite a lot in the winter. Right before Christmas, I got into a car accident. I wasnt badly injured, but the car I was driving (my dad's second vehicle) was totaled. Right from the second I called him, it was clear he only cared about the car. To replace the car we lost, my mom bought a new one, and I was to take her old one to school. I think it was this that set off a chain of events that lead to him degenerating more. About a week ago, my dad was having an argument with my mother regarding a certain other lady friend my dad had been talking to. When my dad gets mad, he acts like a toddler. Throwing things, and breaking shit. In this case, he kicked his door countless times, breaking not only the doorknob, but also the hinges. It now couldn't fully shut without being forced. About 3 days ago, I was home from school with my girlfriend, like I am every day. I hadn't spoken to my dad that day at all, haven't even seen him. But he came in angry. He called me in and said \"what have you been doing all day?\" I reminded him that I had school. He then asked why the driveway wasn't snow blowed. (At first I was confused;Did I miss a text? Did he ask me to this morning? No... No he didn't. And besides, in the past he's told me to not start up the snowblower without him being there, because one time I did and it smelled like gas. ) I told him \"Oh, I'm sorry. Did you ask me to?\" In a polite tone. He said aggressively \"DO I NEED TO TELL YOU TO WIPE YOUR OWN ASS TOO?\" I told him that I would do it first thing tomorrow morning. He seemed satisfied with that, and went downstairs to his room. He then started screaming at me, accusing me of being in his room. I hadn't even been downstairs lately, so I was confused. He kept insisting that I broke his door and that \"it wasn't that broken before.\" When I told him that I didn't touch his door, he called me a liar, among other rude words. Sure, whatever, the man's old, maybe he forgot breaking his own door. Later, when my mom got home from work, she told me to go out and shovel the driveway to make him happy. At 9:00 at night. I did, but when I came back in, things weren't much better. He was still accusing me of breaking his door, and screaming at my mother. When she told him that it in fact, was himself who broke his door, he went ballistic. He screamed and screamed and screamed for hours on end. He came up in my room at 11:30 at night, got in my face, and told me that I lost all my privileges and am never aloud to touch his cars again. (Including my mother's car, which he has no control over.) Then again he came into my room while I was trying to sleep at about 1:30 in the morning (This was on a Wednesday, school and work tomorrow.) This time he told me how I was kicked out of the house as soon as I was able to be, and that \"If I ever get in his face again, he'll put me in the ground.\" I said nothing. The next day I have school. My dad is adamant about my not using my mother's vehicle, so to try to soothe troubled waters my mom took me to school. For the first time in 4 years, I got a ride from my mommy, and took the bus home from school. That night he yelled some more, this time making it known to us that he had not slept in over a week. I don't know why he hasn't slept, but it was clear he was miserable, and so if he was miserable and couldn't sleep, neither could the rest of his entire family. The next day is a friday (today). Due to testing, I didn't need to go to school today. My dad came in my room early in the morning, woke me up, and screamed at me about how I should have already taken the bus and that the snow Better be taken care of. I tried to explain that I didn't need to go to school, but he wasnt hearing it. He told me to go anyway, and that I'm NOT taking the car. He told me to walk to school. I live almost 3 miles away and it's the middle of winter. Whatever, I'll go try to sedate him by taking care if the snow. I went and did it, and when I got back in he told me \"you WILL go bring in wood before you go to school\" very clearly not asking. I just said \"no problem dad\" and did that too. At this point, I didn't know what to do, because I cant just walk to school, they'd have nowhere to put me if I did. Instead, I walked to a nearby store (only about a half mile away) and asked my girlfriend's brother to come pick me up. Luckily, he did, and I was able to escape to my girlfriend's house for most of the day. Apparently, while I was gone, he and my brother had an altercation. Without my mother or me to scream at, he went after my brother. (I should mention, my brother is 21, absolutely huge, autistic and disabled.) After fighting for a bit, apparently something in  his crazy brain told him to rip mine and his doors off their hinges. Eventually things escalated and he got to shoving my brother around, and he wasnt taking any of that. He shoved my dad off of him and into a wall, and called the police. When the police came, my dad refused to talk to them. Hearing about this, my mom came home early from work. The police told her to take my brother away for a bit to let dad \"calm down\". Fast forward a few hours later, and we're at where I am now. I'm sitting in my room, and I don't have a door anymore. My mom told me to not try to put the door back on, or else dad will throw it out in the yard.  I know alot of people with abusive parents do something to anger them, wether it be disrespecting them, running away, breaking shit, whatever, but I literally haven't done anything. I try so hard to do everything he says, but he still hates me. I wish I could convey the way he looks at me and speaks to me in text form. He treats me like a slave, literally. That I'm just there to do what he says, and if I do it wrong or not at all, I'll be punished. I don't know where to go. Ideally, I'd like him out of this house, and out of our lives. I genuinely wish he were dead. Lacking that though, how do I remove myself, my mom, and brother from this situation? \n\nI know I probably didn't explain this completely and there's holes in the story, so feel free to ask any questions. I need help.\nTL:DR My dad is going completely insane. What do I do?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I'll be fine, and then something will remind me of the past and I'm up in middle of the night sobbing... A dream, a memory, a passing comment... Doesn't matter. How do you move forward? How do you accept healthy love after being denied it for so long? I wasn't beaten or berated daily. I was ignored and loved wrong. My parents wanted to be my friends and peers. They wanted to party and lean on me for emotional support. I thought it was great when I was younger. Being the drug dealer's daughter, your mom is so doped up that she doesn't know what is happening most of the time, and nobody notices when you ditch school or stay up all night getting drunk at 15 years old... It also meant nobody did anything when my dad molested teenage girls, it meant that nobody gave a shit when I graduated from high school, it meant raising my sister's baby because she was also just a kid (18 months older than me) and didn't know what she was doing. I thought I had gotten out and gotten away when I married a man 9 years older than me and started a family at 18 years old. He was emotionally and mentally abusive and manipulative. After my dad went to prison for what happened in the past (sister pressed charges after we had daughters), I realized that I was in a marriage that I ran away to and I was miserable! It took until I was almost 25 years old to get away and finally start a life on my own. I was doing great, and thought I was finally healed! Good job, handling single mom life like a boss, got into a great relationship........ Then life happened again.\nI ended up pregnant, amazing guy wasn't so amazing and ditched me while I was too sick to work. Ended up staying with family, forced to care for my sick mother who berated me daily about being a disappointing daughter, and then my sister moved in also. She began partying like crazy and bringing strange men home. It was like being back in my childhood home again. Just before the baby was born, his dad came to his senses and rescued me from that situation. It's been five years...\n\nI'm completely fucking broken now. I can't seem to get back to where I was. I have been so strong for such a long time, and now I just can't do it anymore. I'm so tired! It's like when you've been standing all day and you don't realize how exhausted you are until you finally sit down. Then it's almost impossible to get back up again... That's where I am at, and I just need some encouragement... I'm going to be 32 in a few months and I don't feel like a whole person or an able minded adult, yet I am. I'm married and everyone tells me what a great mom I am, but I don't feel worthy. I don't understand how my husband can love me if my own parents couldn't. I don't think I'm a great mom, I just got lucky and have great kids. I honestly feel like everyone would be better off without me. The only reason I don't kill myself is because I don't want my kids to ever feel like it was their fault. I wish for an accident though, I just want to disappear forever and stop hurting.

Sorry this ya long!\n\nIn a nutshell married for almost 17 years, I\u2019m 38, husband is 47. 2 kids one is 12 and one is 1yr old.\nI work and have a good income.\n\nI was raised in an abusive family so I grew up thinking abuse was my fault... I got married and he would loose his temper... like super batshit crazy angry over minor things. Due to my history I either fought back or apologized. I never realized until like 2 years ago that his batshit temper and rage and blaming me for anything which goes the way he doesn\u2019t like was not my fault!\n\nSo, the abuse isnt daily we go through cycles.. but I feel like the s past 2 years when we hit that plateau and something really upsets him the violence is much worse! Or maybe I\u2019m getting older and just am fed up. I know instinctively should I leave or try to force divorce he will go absolutely nuts and get vengeful and probably try to hurt me or our kids. \n\nWe\u2019ve had other issues... infidelity on his end and frankly we should have divorced ages ago but hes always refused. He says he values his family and other bullshit. I know and understand it\u2019s utter bullshit. \n\n2 years ago I learned of infidelity and left at night with our son, went to a shelter, got a PFA, leave from work, had the local cops involved and filed for divorce. \nDuring the month we lived in the shelter he stalked my mother, father and aunt; threatened them, their local police got involved! I know I can\u2019t go to my family as no one would support my efforts to leave and he\u2019d find us immediately.  I managed to find an apartment and we worked out a visitation plan for our son. I went completely no contact. But, stupid stupid stupid me a mutual friend got involved and talked me into making contact with him.. I did... via email just to talk abt our son at first and he lovebombed me which looking back I know is classic abusive behavior! I was eager to see if things could be fixed as he seemed as well and so we met up with our son at my moms... we talked and it seemed like he had realized the errors of his ways. That he seemed re-committed to our family.\n\nSo I came back. Therapy was a waste of time. I ended up gradually discovering more infidelity related bullshit, but he was remorseful and like most couples in this situation we didn\u2019t think clearly. I got pregnant with our youngest. He was perfect that year.\n\nOkay fast forward he\u2019s slipping back into his nasty abusive ways and I\u2019m really afraid he will either kill me or hurt me in a very very bad way or I\u2019ll snap and vise-versa. I\u2019m fully capable of fighting and can protect myself... I also weight life so it\u2019s possible. And tonight he had a major blow up over a freaking computer charger. I attempted to rationalize with him but when something doesn\u2019t go his way he becomes irrational and can and will do anything. We fought alittle and our 12yr old got involved to protect me... unfortunately because he did he turned on his 12yr old and ripped the book he was holding out of his hand causing a big gash and swelling in his one hand, he also for good measure threatened to destroy my work laptop and he broke my glasses... he\u2019s broken multiple pairs of glasses in the past and 2 personal laptops as well. I had my work stuff hidden so that stuff was ok and I have contacts so I put those in.\n\nBut, I realized it will never get better. I want to plan my leaving better this time so it\u2019s successful. Any ideas?\nI\u2019m done and for my kids I absolutely must leave.\n\nMy concerns are... myself, my kids and my families safety! He gets irrational and goofy... I know he will stalk them, possibly threaten them, probably threaten to harm himself because he\u2019s so dramatic! \nI worry about a PFA... it was a pain in the arse to get and I still had to allow our son to see his dad. How do I know his dad won\u2019t hurt him this time?\n\nSure I could call, find a shelter, notify the police and leave when he\u2019s at work but I dunno if I have the emotional energy to go through the hell\nI went through the first time! \n\nI could also contact the lawyer I saw originally but I\u2019m stuck if he refuses once again to sign. He\u2019s a stubborn jerk.. instead of realizing it\u2019s better for all of us to separate he only cares that he\u2019d be alone and how inconvenient! Can divorces be pushed through? Even if the server spouse refuses to sign? \n\nI dunno I just need some ideas!

She went through two other supplies in the succeeding month. Then she hoovered me back in November. She devalued me again in December, but before she could discard me, I dumped her and went no contact. I had done my research by then, and when she tried to truangulate me with the same guy from last time, it became pretty obvious. So, I ended things first.\n\nWe are part of the same degree course at the University, and that's why implementing no contact has been extremely difficult, amidst her strong hoovering attempts that have been reproducing the same emotional trauma in my head. But almost 40 days of sheer resilience and pain paid their dues today.\n\nI was in the simulation lab. So was she, dressed in the outfit I had bought for her, that she was wearing for the second day in a row, desperately trying to get my attention. Also present was her present primary supply, who was being ignored by her for a few days now, as she was completely focused on getting my attention. Also present was a girl from other department, who's very attractive as well. My nex has always been jealous and insecure about her.\n\nSo this other girl asked me if I had a girlfriend. I flirted with her for a while. My nex almost lost her mind. She started to hoover around us. Then I jokingly asked her what the traits of a responsible girlfriend were. My nex's new supply is also a mutual friend. As tea time approached, our conversation transpired into a group discussion about relationships, that included this girl and my nex's new supply.\n\nI subtly gave away hints of a fake relationship and how some people can get involved with disordered people. I narrated my experience. I didn't mention my nex. She wasn't part of our table but she was sitting at the adjoining table. Her new supply heard my story and clearly it resonated with him. I also explained how to implement no contact to regain one's mental health. I asked the other girl out. We made a date.\n\nBack at the lab, my nex seemed panicked. At the end of the session, she approached and asked me if we could stop ignoring each other. I said no and walked away. She went back to her supply. His change in attitude also perlplexed her. He ended things with her later that evening. I don't know if he would be as resilient as me but I wish him all the best. The trauma bonding is not at all easy to dissolve. I myself, am unable to stop thinking about her. A large portion of my time is still consumed with her thoughts. \n\nSo, looking at it from my nex's perspective, I rejected her for a more attractive person. Her latest supply dumped her. Many people as a result of that group discussion must have or will eventually figure out the true nature of her. Overall, a day of heavy narcissistic injuries. I don't mean to seek revenge or anything, but after a month long trauma, I think I deserve some sort of payback. \n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm sorry if this seems all over the place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHi, My name is Emma. I am 17 years old and have had a lot of abuse in my life(obviously since I'm writing this). My dad didn't show up to my birth, even though he was right across town. He simply wanted to keep working, even though my mom was in labor for 12 hours. My dad has always been distant, I don't think he ever really wanted me to be quite honest. But that's a whole other can of worms. Growing up, I had a really difficult family to get along with. Half the family hated the other half, with literal generations of abuse and mental illness on our hands. Let's start with my mother, shall we?  My mother, having gone through abuse in her childhood, has seemingly grown a complex that she can't do wrong as long as it's not as bad as her own abuse. She'd pinch my butt, make comments on my boobs, once even made fun of me for asking why I mattered. Called me broken for not wanting to wear ponytails and berets in my hair, etc. She also is the one who brought my stepdad into the abusive mixture. He is, by far, the most abusive one in my story. He'd belittle me and my mom, was staring straight at my face when he was having sex with my mom(we were sharing a room at the time) when I was around 11. He once picked up my cat and threw her outside and I can still hear the thud as she hit the ground sometimes. He locked me in my room for hours one time after he made me move all of my stuff in to another room. I sat in there and cried for a long time before I just fell asleep. I even suspect that he drugged me when I was around 13-ish. But that doesn't put  an end to my sexual abuse. When I was 6, my cousin was staying with my family. We would lock ourselves in the bathroom sometimes and just talk, which wasn't bad, but one day he said that he wanted to take a shower, so I got up and tried to leave. He put his arm on the door and wouldn't let me leave. He then started stripping and this is where my memory starts getting really fuzzy and that scares me to no end. I once sobbed into my moms shoulder telling her about it. My cousin committed suicide in 2017, so I'll never get to ask him about it since I repressed it for so long. Not to mention my cousins(separate cousin from the last) left a porn tab open on the computer after he had used it. He didn't even make an attempt to ask for the computer back for a minute so he could delete it either, which makes me think that he did it on purpose. I used to make my toys have sex at the age of 8-9. My aunt, cousin, her boyfriend, and my aunts boyfriend would all smoke meth around me with nothing but a sheet to protevt me from it. And my mom is the same one who left me there in that meth-house with a nearly 103 fever so she could go have sex with some guy. She'd regularly bring me to hookups with guys when I was barely 9 years old. There's probably more, but It's making my chest feel really heavy typing this all out at once, and I don't want to stress myself too hard.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I realize my Narc ex is just another traumatized person like me, though I'm co-dependent. In my time with her, I thought I saw her for who she really was, not this false self, glimpses of her.

As if we can resolve our traumas, and then we will be happily ever after. Her ambivalent feelings toward me, or the ambivalent expressions of feelings, is what makes me emotionally overwhelmed. Especially when I was with her. Ignoring me more and more during days / weeks, and when I said, I'm done, she love-bombed me to bits. It's the same now.

In a round about way, I learned that supply decided to stay with the nex and work through things.  The nex was unbeknownst to us, promising both of us a future and a home together with them. \n\nI\u2019ve been going to therapy, surrounding myself with friends and family, trying not to ruminate too much, and trying to be kind to myself for ignoring all my gut instincts. While the nex has been on my mind frequently, I\u2019ve had very few desires to contact them, never once have I picked up the phone to call or text. In a weird twist, about two months after the breakup I was offered a promotion that means in less than 2 months, I\u2019m moving across the country. I hope that will give me even more closure and a much needed clean slate. But it\u2019s hard to know that I will do this without a word to the nex. \n\nToday has been rough, I had a dream last night that I returned to the Nex\u2019s house to pick up some odd and ends that belong to me while they were at work. The other supply was in the house and they weren\u2019t angry about me being there. They walked me through where my things might be and the dream was so vivid while I traveled through the rooms where we spent so much time together. As I continued to talk to the other supply, they mentioned how excited they were to prepare to marry the nex and have children, to which I very carefully replied, \u201cdidn\u2019t the nex tell you they didn\u2019t ever want those things?\u201d  I didn\u2019t do this to be cruel, but felt my heart sink as the other supply started to cry. The nex was so clear with me that they would never marry and did not want kids. They had been in a very long term relationship before us and neither marriage or kids had occurred, so I so believe this to be the truth. As the other supply and I talked, the nex pulled into the driveway as I scrambled to leave without then knowing I was there. Through the front window I saw them and I woke up in a cold sweat with my mind racing.  \n\nAnd today there is just a knot in my stomach and I feel as hurt as I did the day I walked away. Nothing about this breakup or relationship was normal and while I know that the nex will never change their ways, today I don\u2019t feel like I won by getting out, but like I lost some game that I never wanted to play and like I somehow failed.

In the beginning, every weekend we'd meet up and he'd be really romantic and affectionate. We'd spend our time intertwined on the sofa watching cosy films, going out on day trips, making great meals together and he used to make fabulous breakfasts. He was literally the perfect boyfriend and it felt heavenly. But then from very early on, his entire attitude would be different to this during the week. Whenever I went round on a certain weekday night, he'd be cold, distant, would narrow his eyes at me, smirk and laugh directly at me. If I tried to be affectionate and cuddle him he would slowly angle his body away from me so that it hurt my back to cuddle him, so I'd have to sit upright next to him and he'd just either stare at the tv and ignore me or smirk at me. I just had to sit there watching this horrible sexist tv programme he loved. He'd have made no effort and I felt so confused at the complete 180 shift from the man I'd spent the weekend with.\n\nThe complete shift in personality was so strange and confusing. I brought it up with him several times assuming maybe he was tired from work or something and he flat out denied he was any different. Later on I found evidence that he was probably cheating so I think he was having sex with other people during the week and the smirk was a combination of duper's delight and just total contempt for me. \n\nAfter all the smirking and contempt as soon as I left he'd then send me a sweet text saying how much he'd enjoyed seeing me and how he couldn't wait to see me again. It was so confusing the constant changing personality combined with his complete denial that there was any change at all (gaslighting).\n\nIt bothers me how convincing his acting was. He was SO CONVINCING guys, I just can't even process it still. I had absolutely no idea it was an act. I'm worried that when I start dating again (if ever), that I'll get fooled again by another psychopath or narcissist. I know all of the red flags and am pretty well in tune with my gut but still it concerns me. It's particularly upsetting because before meeting him I'd actually read about red flags and about psychopaths, narcissists and other bad characters so I thought I knew what to look for. I even mentioned this stuff to him and told him that he had red flags according to the internet!! I think the problem was the articles I read were for red flags of players rather than Cluster Bs so I just wasn't prepared for the level of deception. I had no idea there were people out there like this who play such elaborate long romance cons on people like this.

This summer will mark three amazing years with her. We first met when we were both in high school, and fast forward nearly three years later, we are living together and building a life together. I love this girl dearly, and am happy with our relationship. There is only one main problem. My best friend of nearly ten years has become a strain on our relationship. \n\nIt really all started a couple years back, when we had first started dating. He had just gotten out of a toxic relationship where he had been cheated on, and around the same time I had just entered a happy relationship.  My current girlfriend and him had \u201ctalked\u201d much prior to us even meeting, therefore before I moved forward with officially dating her, I asked him if he was comfortable. He assured me it was 100% okay and that they literally talked and hung out once and it wasn\u2019t even a bother, even told me he was happy for me. This lasted maybe four months. Eventually I began to notice his jealousy, he began insulting my girlfriend to me, and eventually to her. I am not talking petty insults, he really crossed the line. He called her a \u201cstupid bitch,\u201d a \u201ccontrolling cunt,\u201d a \u201cfat cow\u201d etc. He even got to a point where he threatened to physically assault her after doxxing her and finding out where she lived. He is a computer hacker so he also took the time to hack both of our social media accounts and lock us out just to fuck with us.  It was pretty bad for a good amount of time. Not sure why he was ever this angry, but regardless I cut him off for like a year. \n\nCome a year later, I had realized something that everyone had been telling me for years, that my best friend was a manipulative narcissist. But he was still my best friend, so I tried to make it work with him. Nearly a year later, he apologized all while telling us he was just a very angry person at the time and should never have acted the way he did to someone who was basically his brother. So we gave him another chance, my girlfriend and I both forgave him and allowed him to slowly enter our lives again. From the time we made up until right now there have still been many instances of \u201csorry\u201d from him, just less important things than the first time. Regardless I have heard sorry one hundred fucking times from this guy. In that one year apart my friend had became addicted to opiates. It became all he would ever talk about. Getting high on oxy, heroin, pills etc. was the only thing that he revolved his life around. We were 18 years old at this point, while the rest of us were working long hours, and paying bills, and building our lives he was focused on getting high and buying drugs on the dark web. Eventually it became an actual problem that I was forced to confront, he had overdosed a handful of times already and still showed no signs of wanting to quit. Eventually his addiction made him violent and aggressive to his own family and they decided to kick him out. \n\nMy friend worked as a part time cook at a bar, and found a co-worker who was also fellow drug user, and stayed with since he had been kicked out. Knowing the circumstances made me really sad. I didn\u2019t want to see him living with a fellow addict. I didn\u2019t want to wake up one day to find out he was dead. This dude had been like my brother since we were 11 years old. Therefore I reached out to him and gave him an idea. I told him I would let him stay in my home with my girlfriend and I for one single month, with the ultimatum he checks himself into rehab after the month had ended. His parents are very wealthy, therefore he had great healthcare, so he had complete access to get clean. I told him the one rule was to try and not use in my home when he was living there. Him being homeless, he agreed. I even told him he could smoke cigarettes and weed all he wanted, just no hard shit. He agreed, and I felt that was a good compromise.\n\nHe had recently been prescribed to suboxone, a drug that would help him quit craving opiates. He promised me he was taking it, eventually I found out he was lying to me and taking it very little, so he could continue using behind my back. The time he was there, he snorted and shot up cocaine, was smoking oxy off tinfoil, and had bought morphine pills on the dark web and was shooting them up when I was at work. Then when I was at work he overdosed in my house, and luckily was able to make it to the hospital in time to survive. Before he got back to my house, I began packing his stuff up because he had crossed the line, completely lied to me, manipulated me, and used me. When packing, I found some needles, cotton, and measuring cup he was cooking his drugs in. When he got back, I had my girlfriend hide in the bathroom out of fear he would violently lash out due to the drugs he was on. I finally got him to leave, and had yet to hear see him for weeks. I remained a friend to him via social media, because I still cared for him and his sobriety. I was just done enabling him. \n\nHe eventually committed himself to inpatient rehab. It seemed like things were going uphill finally. Until about a week in that is. After seven days he had managed to get kicked out for apparently \u201cvoicing his opinion that opiates should be legal.\u201d As if he wasn\u2019t aware that would get him booted. It is fucking drug rehab, what did he think was going to happen? So he got out, and to no surprise I found out has continued using. Pretty sure him committing himself was just a ploy to please those around him like me, his parents, and his girlfriend. He never wanted to get clean, he told me that, even when he was living with me he told me he would go, but didn\u2019t want to get clean, and believed he would be using for the rest of his life and was okay with that. So I am sure was elated when he was discharged. Fast forward about a month, we got in a small argument via Facebook Messenger over a post that was made, it really was a pointless argument, probably never needed to even happen. How my girlfriend was brought up? I have no idea. But before I know it, he was back to calling her a manipulative cunt, a stupid bitch, told her she deserves no respect, and basically said he owed her no appreciation for letting him live in her home for a month. All this new anger stemmed from the fact that he blamed my girlfriend for him being kicked out for breaking our rules, he had the audacity to blame her for being kicked out of my house. He didn\u2019t acknowledge he broke OUR rules, and was using on our premises and lying to us, but instead blamed it all on her, telling me that my relationship was shit. Telling me that if I wasn\u2019t with her those rules never would have been implemented. Zero responsibility for his own actions, and zero accountability for anything.  He was also very upset that my girlfriend didn\u2019t want me to smoke weed with him every single night, something I had agreed to do in moderation prior to him living there.\n\nI have had him cut off for over a week now. Now just recently he is using a situation he is in to try and get us to hang out again. Because he is caught up with the law he wants to \u201cmeet up in person\u201d continuously to talk about it telling me \u201cusing messages is too dangerous because it can be subpoenaed in court.\u201d He could be facing prison time at this point, the crimes he committed are federal crimes and highly illegal. I don\u2019t want to be involved with it at all. I don\u2019t want to be involved with him anymore. I don\u2019t want this fucking narcissist to continue to walk all over me like a doormat. I have let him do it for too long, and I really do feel that cutting him off for good is what is best for me right now. He is no longer someone I even know, he has turned into a complete narcissist, a drug addict, a manipulative person, and a complete roadblock in my relationship. Do you know how many times the subject of the arguments with my girlfriend involve him? Too many. We aren\u2019t little kids anymore, situations change and so do people. I want feedback. Rarely have I had a third party in any of this, because it is always between him and I, and maybe my girlfriend when it involves her. I want to hear an unbiased opinion on my situation, how the fuck do eradicate this person from my life for good? ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

There was a time I was part of a triad with he and his wife, in which all three of us unexpectedly and to our pleasant surprise, kind of fell in love with each other  My personal values that honor family first meant that ultimately, I needed to step away from them so that they could work on mending what was broken in their relationship, and I didn't believe it was going to happen while I was present. When we found each other again, after both of our marriages ended (mine very short-lived, with a tragic ending that is a story for another day. spoiler alert: BPD + psychotic episode = barely escaping with my life), we took our time, slowly building, and once again it was an unexpected surprise when we fell deeply in love with one another.\n\nAfter I broke it off, I kept looking for ways for it to have been a mistake because it happened to suddenly. I snapped in a moment that he was being such a monster to me that I no longer recognized him as the man I loved. The way he behaved was consistent with an increasingly frequent pattern of abuse visited upon me during conflict, and in that moment, I could no longer accept it. He was so scathing, rubbing salt in the wound that had formed slowly at first, but as conflict became more frequent, was raw, and was never given a chance to heal.\n\nLooking back at our very first conflict, this is when the erosion of my trust in him began. When we fought, it was because I didn't care about him enough. During the conflict, he would have no empathy, even going so far as to express hostile contempt for my boundary of no profanity during conflict by swearing \\*at\\* me repetitiously. When we made up, generally after a week or longer of no contact and then therapy, it was never his fault, and he would stop working as soon as his needs were met. He would not even once to this day, take accountability for treating me so horribly. It caused so much cognitive dissonance that the first handful of times it happened, I thought it had to be a fluke.\n\nI never in a million years wanted for this to be the outcome with the man I thought I wanted to spend the rest of my days with, but I was so weary. When I broke up with him, it's almost as if my subconscious took over, saying in protest \"No more of this girl! It's not right and you won't take even another second of it.\"\n\nHe was in utter disbelief.  He was so heartbroken, and couldn't understand or come to terms with my \"sudden\" abandonment...\n\nI believed him at first. I was willing to let go of the cruel things he had said to me in the days just following the breakup to try to find a way back to one another, to mend us. But coming back to him once was all it took for him to know I would keep working, and it took less and less time for good behavior to quickly toggle to ill treatment of me again.\n\nAnd from thereon out, every attempt at reconciling with him would quickly end the same way. I would protest at the way he was treating me, the inner voice of my subconscious knowing it wasn't right, always guiding me in making the right decision in those heated moments, when his contempt was so thick it was palpable, visceral even. It cut me to my very core, and I kept rejecting it, unwilling to normalize his behavior as acceptable.\n\nAnd then would come the stonewalling. Oh, the stonewalling. It was so cold. He knew it was torture for me. He knew it would be the thing that eventually broke me and lured me back. He used that against me too, twisting my love for him into neediness and desperation.\n\nThat love was like a drug, and I was strung out addict for it. I've had substance abuse problems before, but I'd never felt so out of control as I did during this time. I would hope that maybe I'd gotten through to him this time, and that it would be the last time I had to explain to a grown man, why respect and kindness were a bare minimum requirement for any human being to be in my life.\n\nHe even had our therapist fooled. She would witness him acknowledge what I was saying and I thought, OK, finally, someone else heard me, and witnessed him hear me too.  But the moment we left therapy, it was as if it never happened.\n\nRinse. Repeat. Whiplash, again and again.\n\nUntil one day, when we were clearly over but still in need of some way to negotiate our shared extended community, and the social landscape of both being music makers within it, we went to a therapy session together and then just after that, he....disappeared. Poof! He became unresponsive to all attempts to reach him. I would hear from others that he was talking \\*about\\* me but he wouldn't acknowledge me. He made is as evident as possible to me that his gaze was on anything and everything except *me.*\n\nEventually, when I called him out for that, he flipped the story and accused me of being the aggressor and the abuser. He did it in such a way that he got others involved, telling them fictitious, slanderous stories, and cherry-picking a few choice  private communications from me in which I expressed my righteous indignation for his treatment of me, as a way to paint me as the crazy one.\n\nI had already had enough time during the latest round of deep freeze from him to begin to truly understand the injustice of what had happened to me. But this is what it took to *finally break the spell.*\n\nI had been petitioning with him for the removal of pictures of me from his social media profiles for a while, because I was not going to accept his painting of any other story than the one that was actually happening.\n\nBefore making my final exit, I used the arrival of observers on the scene as an opportune moment to point out the covert act of aggression it was for him to disregard the numerous requests I had made within the month since I initiated the request. He was clearly reading my emails to have summoned them to his home in a panic because he thought I was going to come to his house and attack him (I'd given him back his house key over three months ago, so what was I going to do? Yell at him through the walls? Uh huh. yerp. OK. If I could roll my eyes any harder, I think I'd have a brain aneurism.) By way of peer pressure, because not even those who believe him could \\*not\\* question why he remained in willful violation of my consent, and was refusing to grant me something so simple, especially if he was afraid me because I had been abusive, he took them down. Well, kind of. All he really did was change the share permissions to be visible to friends only. In pointing this out too, some of those who were stirring the pot by getting involved to begin with, told me that the only way to win this game is to not play.\n\nAnd you know what, they're right, but not in the way they think. I'm not playing his game, nor am I going to play theirs. The only way to win this game is to opt out completely. So, that's exactly what I've chosen to do. He's left holding the bag, and has to answer to scrutiny over the contradiction between his words and actions, and I'm no longer engaged so that he can point a finger of blame at me.\n\nAbout a month ago, knowing I would ever allow him to set foot in my home to retrieve his belongings himself, I dumped them all into a box (even is hair brush full of his hair), along with all of the gifts he's ever given me, and taped it up. Tonight, I decided it was time to be rid of it. I dumped it on his doorstep when I knew he wouldn't be home without so much as a word about it to anyone.\n\nIt feels like my home has been cleansed and a weight that I didn't even know I was carrying, lifted from my shoulders.\n\nFreedom, at last. There is no rewinding the clock from this point of no return. It's bittersweet, and different than I thought it would be. But I can at long last, truly begin healing, with certainty that there was nothing I could have done to change the outcome, and certainty that there's no other that I would choose, knowing what I know now.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was always there for him and  I ended up doing everything, it was a one sided relationship. The biggest surprise I had when I moved out was that I actually had free time and I wasn't constantly cleaning up after him or scrambling  to try to make him happy. He was so incredibly selfish, and instead of just being alone in the world I carried the weight of two people not just myself. I was talking with a friend and I realized all of the huge moments I had in my life where he wasn't there for me or he added to the burden and made things worse for me. This going to be a wall of text, but I'd like to vent:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we moved to a different state he chose that he was going to work on a big unnecessary project in the week and a half I had off of work that we were supposed to be packing. His project was to sand down the paint of an antique chest with a dremel and try to stain it ect. I begged him not to start this project and asked him for his help with packing and cleaning, he refused. I packed both of us and deep cleaned everything, I did it all by myself. He later berated me for not being able to carry my side of a heavy old couch, and he never did finish the antique chest. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I totaled my car coming home from work by hitting a deer, and my car was literally on fire, I asked him for help. I asked him to drive me to and from work the next day because I was freaked out. He refused and he had nothing else he needed to do during that time period (no work, or school ect). I had to drive a rental car to and from work the next day, and I shook the entire time. I also bought a new car by myself because he didn't want to go.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen he got his two wisdom teeth out (that didn't require surgery) I was there for him. When I got mine out he took hundreds of photos of me super drugged up and swollen. He didn't help me at all, and I had surgery to have four removed with complications. He wouldn't go to the store to get me food, he did absolutely nothing to help me. Instead he made fun of me and how swollen my face was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was attacked by a patient at work, he didn't acknowledge my text that I was hurt and he ignored my phone calls. He refused to talk to me about it when I got home, he wouldn't even acknowledge I was hurt. I ended up not being able to use my dominant arm for months and had to undergo 5 months of occupational therapy and I was not medically cleared to work. He wouldn't do ANYTHING to help me during that time period, like doing dishes, or driving me to a doctor's appointment.  He also didn't clean up after himself during this time period and made it harder for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I got a great new job, with the interview process taking 5 months he refused to acknowledge it or recognize that I got a good new job. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I developed a food allergy, he fed me that food hidden in salsa because he thought it was funny. My throat swelled up. He then ridiculously stocked the house with that food, he would go out of his way to make sure foods had that ingredient  were in the house (he never shopped like that before). He would hype up ordering a pizza for us both then I would open it and the ingredient I was allergic to was all over it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had to put both of his childhood dogs down during different time periods. For the first he refused to help me take the first dog to the vet when she suddenly couldn't walk overnight. I had to take his childhood dog to the vet myself, when I could hardly carry her. For his second childhood dog that had to be put down he took tons of pictures of me crying, and he constantly looked at the pictures and would often show me pictures of myself crying. He also mocked and recreated a sad sound I made when putting the first dog down for years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor major moments, big interviews, or long travel days he would purposefully kept me up all night, usually by yelling at the TV while playing video games or bursting into my room in the middle of the night to tell me something (we slept in separate rooms, he refused to sleep in the same bed as me or be intimate with me). I was the sole breadwinner, and had to work during the day. He didn't work and he would then sleep all day, so I'd be exhausted and he would be fine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a major birthday of mine he played video games all day, yelled at me for talking to him while he played video games and he did nothing for my birthday and got me no presents and spent no time with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was excited or happy somehow, he would say something really nasty, yell at me, tell me I'm ugly ect. I would then go to my room and shut the door. He would be upset that he couldn't see my reaction to his cruelty and would try to physically block my way or physically force himself into the room. The doors didn't have locks and I had to sit against the door so he couldn't open it. He never apologized and he wanted to see me upset. He often acknowledged that he said or did something wrong, but with no remorse and a sense of pride. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn long road trips when he was driving he used it as an opportunity to hold me hostage to his nasty comments and criticisms. He also thought it was funny when I needed to desperately go to the bathroom to say he was going to stop at a rest area then drive right past it and watch my face. He also discarded me by holding me hostage during a 5 hour drive, and laughed and smiled while doing so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I brought up his abusive behavior and how he wasn't treating me was ok, he would turn the tables on me and say it wasn't just him and I do things wrong too. One of the things I did wrong during one of these conversations he made a huge deal of was me leaving time on the microwave instead of clearing it so it would display the time.

English is not my native language so I apologize in advance if my text contains mistakes or my sentences are a mess. If this is the wrong subreddit for this post, please let me know so I can delete/crosspost. I'm 27F.\n\nSecond thing, this is gonna be a long one because I have to write everything down in order to give you proper insight and to document it for myself. Hope that's okay, sorry in advance.\n\nSo, for some years now, I've been wondering if I have experienced something bad in my childhood. Something that comes close to wrong sexual behavior towards a kid. And if it still affects me now. \n\nI have two memories that somehow give me a bad feeling and I don't know what to do about it. They're only shreds of memories though, so I can't say how old I've been and what the context was. First thing is, I remember sleeping in my parent's bed. (I've always been a very close-to-home kid and didn't want to be separated from my parents for too long, so it was normal for me to cuddle with both my mom and my dad.) I kind of remember being \"spooned\" by my father and I remember the way he breathed (kinda... hard, the way you'd breathe when you're \"into it\") and I think I also felt a movement from the hips, but I'm not too sure about this. What I know for sure is I felt uncomfortable in this very moment. I remember this small fraction of a scene very often and I caught myself wondering whether my father masturbated while having me close. I do not remember being touched or where my mom was at this moment, but she was not in the bed with us. \n\nThe second thing I remember is my mom asking me whether my dad has touched me inappropriately. Again, I do not remember any context, just her asking me this. I still see her in front of me and asking me, she was upset and very serious about this. To this day, I wonder if I remember this correctly, if she really asked me about my father, or if it was about being touched by someone in general. But I know for sure we had a conversation (that I think I started!) about this and she wanted me to tell me the truth. I can recall I said \"No\" and changed the subject. \n\nI know that for my mom, the worst possible thing to happen to her kids is sexual abuse. Since I'm a grown-up, we've had a few talks about it (I'm still very close with my mom) and she told me on multiple occasions that she's absolutely horrified by the thought of me or my siblings being raped or abused. I once asked her - maybe two years ago - if something similar had happened to me. If I ever had said something, if she can remember something, but she said she didn't. But she said that this has always been her worst fear.\n\nAlso, there are other things that confuse me very much. I've scrolled though posts in this and other subreddits about sexual abuse against kids and read some points that apply to me. For instance, I vividly remember dreams in which I have sex with my dad - and enjoy it. When I wake up I'm absolutely disgusted and confused. But these kind of dreams reoccur every once in a while. Also I know I've had a time as a kid (arund 11-12 years old) where I had to pee almost every 20 minutes. I know my younger brother had this, too. And I remember complaining to my mom about my genitals being itchy and sore, she bought a cream at the pharmacy for vaginal yeast infection, which I used every day for quite a long time. \n\nAll of these occurances became obvious to me when I started to bond with my now bf. I started dating him when I was 23, he was my first boyfriend and also the first person I've slept with, so I was a rather late bloomer. And it took me a long while until I could finally trust him. I was terribly afraid of sex, I'd been masturbating quite often before, but sex was a whole different thing. I was scared of being hurt, scared of being used, scared of feeling dirty and ashamed afterwards. It was at this point when I noticed that this kind of trust you build and learn as you grow from being a baby, this \"basic trust\", was utterly broken. At least my trust in men. To this day, I feel weird after I've had sex with my bf. He's the most loving, careful bf in the world and I genuinely love him, but I can't help but feel kinda ashamed.\n\nI was in therapy for 4 years from 14 to 18 because of panic and anxiety issues and took mild anti depressants. From 20 to 22 I was in therapy again, and since 2016 I've visited my psychologist every now and them for the same reasons. I have asked her too if she thinks that maybe something has happened to me that my mind just keeps hidden and tries to forget, but she says she doesn't think so. During our sessions, we mostly speak about my dad, because as there are many things about his behaviour that make life miserable for my family and I, but there never are any sexual references.\n\nI just can't figure this out. I've been asking myself thouse questions for years without being able to find an answer. Reddit, is my mind playing tricks on me? Are these symptoms I have (e.g. disturbing dreams) really the signs for abuse? Am I just weird when it comes to sex? Is it possible that I've actually been abused and my mind just blocks the memories? Do all these mental health problems I've had since I was a kid have a deeper reason than anyone could know? Or am I just crazy, or - am I just normal? At some nights (just like yesterday night when I read a post about an abusive father on Reddit again) I can't sleep, because I think about this all over again and again. I just don't know what to do anymore. \n\nAdvice very welcome. Thanks in advance, Reddit. \n\nP.S.: Also, I really really want to apologize to anyone who suffered from actual abuse. If I'm just being crazy, or if this has nothing to do with abuse, please don't think it was my goal to diminish what you've been through. ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

How to deal?", "author": "Sufficient_Succotash", "self_text": " \n\nSo,\n\nabout 2-3 weeks ago I posted here after a terrible relationship that was unlike any other relationship I had had before and I suspected I had run into a narcissist. I had zero experience with narcissists before, but from reading stuff on narc abuse all over the internet and especially on here I realized he first used intense love-bombing to pull me in and then gradually put me down and started to mind-f\\*ck me (for example he would tell me he wants to end the relationship, only to come back minutes later with \"I was only kidding\"). When I kept pushing back, he eventually broke up with me and I told him that I thought it was probably for the best.\n\nNow, after the breakup he didn't contact me for one week. I took the time to somewhat heal and make sense of what I had gone through. Never contacted him once.\n\nAfter about a week, he called me out of the blue. Told me he wanted to see how I was doing, to which I replied fine, and basically told me that the break-up was only because of \"the circumstances\" (long distance) - when it CLEARLY was because of the constant fights we had because he started them or put me down in one way or the other.\n\nEver since then, he has contacted me with increasing frequency, on some days more often than when we were actually dating. At first he kept hinting we'd still be together if we lived closer to each other (same lie he told me during the first call after the breakup), I guess to lure me back in...? Then demanded help from me with some personal issues of his (which I mostly declined) because I guess he wants to see if he can still make use of me...? Now, I guess as he is starting to feel more comfortable again, he does a weird mix of using pet names from during the relationship and some hints of putting me down like he used to. In one conversation he even told me \"if you get a new boyfriend, you still have to talk to me!!!\", to which I just told him he must be out of his mind.\n\nAgain, like during the relationship, I ask myself WHAT THE HECK THIS IS??? Is this behavior normal for narcs? I keep reading they try to suck you back in, but I keep reading that in the context of a person having broken up with the narc, while in my case, HE was the one to end the relationship.\n\nI don't answer most of his calls, but I realize maybe I shouldn't answer at all...?\n\nBut understand what the heck is going on would help me so much.\n\nThe replies to my last post were really eye-opening.

I could never do anything right was constantly in a position of dammed if I do, dammed if I don\u2019t. He started therapy but wasn\u2019t treating me with any more respect in fact it got worse. But he swore to me in November that things would be different and he wouldn\u2019t hurt me anymore and I stupidly believed him. \n\nThen we got noticed we had to move out of our prior rental and in the time we\u2019ve been renting rents skyrocketed so I busted my ass all month trying to find a nice home for us and our two kids finally found one but it was $400/mth higher than our last place. He stood by while I negotiated a two-year lease he knows full well I  can\u2019t afford on my own and a week after we moved in announced he was leaving. \n\nI just found out last night he\u2019s been carrying on with three different women. I never checked the phone records, I trusted him. But I finally did. In December, when I was working myself to the bone to find us a place, get everything packed, do what I could to get the kids ready for Christmas- he was sending 5,800 texts. That averages to 200/day. He always told me he couldn\u2019t talk on the phone during his 12 hour shifts because they have to lock their phones in their lockers but I just found out that\u2019s a lie because he\u2019s been spending every single shift at work texting other women. Then a friend of mind found him on Tinder. It\u2019s the worst gut punch. I\u2019ve been throwing up ever since I found out. I feel like I can\u2019t even get out of bed to function my heart is hurting so bad. But I have a 5 and 7 year old counting on me. And who still think the sun rises and sets on him. \n\nAnd what really kills me is he\u2019s posting all over Facebook pics of him with the kids so all of our mutual friends fawn over what a great father he is. But he\u2019s not because he\u2019s texting literally all the time. He pays attention to them for a second then turns back to his phone. They seem to take it in stride and certainly don\u2019t get annoyed with it like I do but it can\u2019t be healthy for them either.\n\nI just need reassurance that 200 texts a day is crazy (and that doesn\u2019t count tinder chats, Facebook PMs, insta DM, snaps all of which he has too) and that I can be strong enough to survive this gut wrenching pain. And to not give in to my worst impulses to blast him all over Facebook", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Early January he came creeping back with some texts giving a semi-apology and to see how I was doing. We chatted a bit and it was pleasant.

I was supposed to go on a date with someone else Saturday night but that person canceled and I was feeling kind of lonely so I caved and gave in to seeing my nex that night instead. We hooked up in the night, cuddled in his bed, I spent the night, and in the morning he made breakfast and I left a little after noon. The time we spent together was really nice and felt kind of like old times...the sex was so hot in my opinion that I kept thinking about it days later...when I got home I felt like it was a good thing after all because I didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him again but I enjoyed the experience and thought maybe we could just be friends or like hook-up buddies going forward or something and if I wasn\u2019t feeling as emotionally connected to him as in a relationship, maybe it could be mutually beneficial and not be as distress-inducing to be with him as when we were in an actual relationship. Boy was I wrong. I sent him some nice text when I got home saying I had had a great time seeing him again. He hearted it and sent some kind of funny meme in response...and now a week has gone by and I haven\u2019t heard from him since! He had been saying all kinds of things to get me into bed with him like that he really had the hots for me and I was special to him and important to him and he wouldn\u2019t want to cause me pain yadda yadda and also how like he had only had consistent orgasms like with me with one other partner...so I interpreted that to mean the sex was really good for him too and that he was intending to, like, be in touch again in some capacity\u2026.now I\u2019m thinking: what the hell? Were those all just lies he fed me to get me to have a 1-night stand with him? Was he just going through his virtual rolodex to see who would sleep with him? Was he trying to sleep with me as a form of revenge since I was the one that dumped him and this is the equivalent of like a dog peeing on me to show that he still owns me/I\u2019m still part of his \u201cterritory\u201d? /Did he want to get revenge by like getting me to want him again and then dropping off the face of the planet so I'd be left sad and wanting more? Will I hear from him again? What on earth is going on? And what should I do in response? Hit him up at some point so I can \u2018use\u2019 him for sex, too? Ask him what\u2019s going on/say this hurt my feelings? Just never speak to him again? I was kind of hoping the sex would make him feel nostalgic, too, and he would want more from me than just one night...should I be offended like the sex was disappointing or something and that\u2019s why he didn\u2019t come back for more? He also made a few comments during the time I spent there that made me feel a little bad...like I was pretty generous in doling out compliments and showing I was enjoying myself and had positive memories of him and he gave a few little \u201cjabs\u201d that kind of hurt after the fact...not bad enough to be straight out insults per se...but things that felt a little \u201cjab\u201d-y to me...sigh...Sorry if I sound cuckoo myself...any solace would be appreciated... :-/", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

But now, everything feels different. I've been managing my cognitive dissonance by reminding myself of the awful ways he treated me. So, when he contacted me last night, I finally realized I'd had enough. I never deserved that. I had enough of the way he would casually threaten to kill me, then say, \"you are no fun anymore,\" when I told him that wasn't funny. I finally started to belief that he meant the awful things he said. Today, I am struck with such gratitude that I am alive and breathing. I survived. I think about how things could have gone differently and how I could have died at this person's hands. A person who never ever cared about me, who only used me.

Couple years after they had me when i was 4 or 5 i asked my mom and dad to get back together and to my joy they did. I always thought as a kid a mom and dad should be together, but sadly that single decision was possible the worst of my life. \n\nFlash a couple years forward and my dad has a job where he essentially gets pushed around and is fed up with there shit. Well after a party one night my dad was drunk and while my mom was driving he grabed her by the hair and said, \"I BET YOU SUCKED RICHARDS DICK DIDNT YOU.\" While my mom is swerving on the road trying to keep us from going in a ditch. And im in the back crying not knowing what my dad was doing. My mom yells at him to tell him im in the back and to please stop for my sake, and he just looks back at me and continues like he didn't even care about me. My mom pulles into a convient store and askes the woman, that came out to help, to call the cops then he stopped and let her drive away. \n\nThis was the fist of the many times he beat my mom and mentally abused me. He slamed things down on my moms head as she was crawling towards me loking for me to help as i was just standing there crying, and then my mom had to one time hide behind me while i was taking a shower and that was the only time he didnt beat my mom when he was about to. Then when i was 12 or 13 he was stomping around my moms house while he looked like he was about to abuse my mom, then he just looked at me, while i was doing nothing, and said \"you are not my son.\" I burst into tears, and at the time i was so use to the abuse i didnt even know why i was crying.\n\nThis abuse happend for about 10 years. Then i learned the reason my dad did all of this was because he was high on drugs and thougt he could do whater the FUCK he wanted. And the thing im pissed about is how he never got jail time. When he got clean of drugs everybody clapped and cheered him on while i had to live with the hell the was still brewing in my head when i fucking cried at night. \n\nAnd my theropist has told me i need to forgive my dad for what he did because he is trying to right his wrongs, and it's true he is, but i still cant let go of how he ruined my fucking childhood and now he should just be let off the hook no strings.

I don\u2019t know how to process it.", "author": "annubis7739", "self_text": "TW: sexual assault/abuse \n\nI\u2019ll explain my story. I\u2019m a 22 year old male. \n\nAbout 2-3 years ago, I started my journey with acid. Instantly became my favorite drug. I began to feel things again \u2014 intensely. \n\nAround that time, I was also sexually assaulted. It might seem unlikely that a 20 year old male would be sexually assaulted by an 18 year old female but evil can come in many forms at any time, apparently. \n\nShe was a co worker of mine. We worked as servers together. I was always a nice person who wanted to be a friend to everyone. I don\u2019t remember how her and I became \u201cfriends\u201d, she was never very interesting to me. \nOne night, she invited me to come drink with her at a mutual friends. I loved drinking at 20, and I was also suffering from an intense breakup at that time, so naturally, I said yes. She picked me up and we went to our friends, who oddly wasn\u2019t home. We sat in her car where she watched me drink my own body weight in whiskey \u2014 while she stayed sober. I don\u2019t remember what led to what, but then she ended up sexually assaulting me in the back of her car. \n\nAfter that, we continued a sexual relationship. With my journey in psychedelics, it just felt right. I was always a socially anxious guy, with a girl who always had sex with me, and since I had just went through a pretty terrible breakup, I felt wanted. Every time we were together, sex or just hanging out, I was tripping. I did acid a lot, tripping once a week and microdosing everyday. \nWhen I went homeless, she let me stay with her for a couple days. She was always driving me to places. She cheated on her boyfriends (yes multiple) with me. I thought it was love. Somebody actually loved me for once. \nEventually, our sexual \u201crelationship\u201d ended when her mom caught us in the act in girl\u2019s car. Her mom never liked me. \n\nWhat made me really question myself and everything, was that she wanted a relationship with me \u2014 more like she wanted me all to herself \u2014 but I didn\u2019t want to be more than a sexual partner with her. I couldn\u2019t understand why. I never understood why I was having sex with her to begin with. I\u2019m not a casual sex person. I can\u2019t do it unless I\u2019m in love. But I never remembered falling in love with her like I did my ex. When I told her I didn\u2019t want to be anything with her, she told me I crushed her heart. I felt bad and guilty, but at the same time, I knew that I shouldn\u2019t be with this person. She was not intellectual, interesting, creative, or really had a personality. \n\nBut I would have dreams of her. And when I tripped, she frequently entered my mind, or would want to hang out with me. Even after I let her down like that, I let her remain in my life. Once in a while we would talk through social media. I still wanted to see if there was any last chance of what we had being something. \n\nFast forward three years, I\u2019m married. I love my wife more than anything. My wife and I grew up in the same town. She knew my assaulter \u2014 they went to school and graduated together. Wife knew she is bad energy. She asked me about my relationship with her, and when I told it truthfully, she was the one who told me that what happened to me was sexual assault. I had no idea that being given alcohol to loosen up and then unconsciously having sex was sexual assault \u2014 at least on me because I\u2019m a guy. Guys getting raped by girls isn\u2019t something ever discussed or taught. \n\nWe started going to talk therapy, not for our relationship but just to get insights and help for ourselves. From my wife\u2019s advice, I brought up my sexual assault, and then I was told of my Stockholm Syndrome. I had feelings for someone who assaulted me and created a false relationship based off manipulation and narcissism. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think it was my minds way of coping with what had happened. I think it was my mindset at the time and my frequent use of LSD. Acid makes you feel connected, and I tripped around her a lot. Like fuck, it lasted for two fucking years until I met my wife, the best thing that happened to me and my true love of my life. I even remember working and talking about how I needed an emotional connection with a girl in order to have sex with her, so my attacked heard this and used it to her fucking advantage. Knowing I would not have sex with her sober, she pretty much drugged me and went to it. \n\nI never knew I suffered mental or emotional damage until I learned about having developed Stockholm Syndrome. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m still questioning is \u2014 was it the fact that I was on acid all the time, or was it my mindset that led to me having Stockholm Syndrome? And how fucking odd is it that the year I started my psychedelic journey, I also get sexually assaulted? What is this trying to teach me? Is it my fault? Is it hers? I\u2019m still having trouble accepting that I had Stockholm Syndrome? \n\nSorry for this long, depressing story. I just needed to tell people who don\u2019t know me but are willing to talk and listen. ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I remember certain parts but not a lot (I remembered more in therapy). Although I remember it started when my older cousin came to live with us because my grandma didn't want him in foster care. A few month after that I was watching goosebumps because i loved the books and the television series then i remember kissing him and him moving his face to make me kiss him on the lips. The next thing I knew is his tongue was in my mouth  and I was confused. Of course that escalated and he started touching me and making me touch him and preform oral sex on several occasions.   \n\n\nThe memories I remember vividly are him waking me up to preform oral sex on me then me getting scared and crying as I walked home (we were staying in a clubhouse of sorts that my uncle lived in.) The other was a little bit before he got caught and i just remember doing what he said and going along with it. I live with a lot of guilt because of that because it makes me feel like it was my fault and i wanted it. My therapist says that it was part of he grooming process and it isn't my fault but some part of myself wonder why i never cried or screamed or said anything.   \n\n\nLater on when I began to realize i wasn't straight and thought i was gay I 'dated' a girl. She was often mean to me and would cuss me out all the time if i refused to sleep with her. She'd tell me to kill myself if i didn't want to or seen cuts on my body (i was really self destructive then). One time she grabbed a knife from her kitchen and told me \"why don't you just kill yourself and save us all the trouble of dealing with your bullshit. stop being so fucking depressing.\"   \n\n\nshe'd do things like that often and belittle my cuts a lot. another thing she would do is say she loved me to get me to sleep with her then turn around and call me all sorts of names then say she actually liked someone else and wasn't into girls. so i suppose that messed me up a bit.   \n\n\n she'd The next experience was someone I really trusted and looked up to and he groped me at a party a few times and later went on to expose himself to me a few times, granted he never touched me it really messed with my mind.   \n\n\nThat event led to me getting involved with an older man who i regret ever meeting. I mentioned this in an earlier post which I can link in the comments if someone wants but I'll get a bit more graphic here.    \n\n\nI was 16 when we started talking and he was 30. granted a horrible decision on my part. he was kind of my boss because i worked under the table for his company and we talked at a few family parties. My family was super close to the people who worked there because my brother worked there. one night i got drunk and started flirting with him and all of it started innocent enough. but then he would keep asking me to sneak out to meet him at random locations. he drove me out in the middle of nowhere a few times so we could 'have some alone time' and took me to a hotel a few times. all of which disgusts me now.   \n\n\nEventually he asked my mom if he could 'date' me after i turned 17 and she said yes so then he asked me out. (I left my boyfriend for him because I have a wack load of issues and was battling an eating disorder and self destructive behavior that i use to cope when i get in a sexually uncomfortable situation such as being groped at the party. It all made me think he didn't care about me and was all and all a huge mistake.)   \n\n\nHe started getting really grabby and like practically forced himself on me anytime he felt the need. he'd also get me high and stuff. I have a huge issue with saying no but i would always say things like \"can we not do this right now?\" or something like that and he would either ignore me or try to barter with me for other sex acts. It reached a breaking point when i woke up and he was trying to jerk of onto me and grope me. touching me like that in my sleep is a huge no for me because i have really bad ptsd from when i was a child so i flipped out. I tried to break things off with him there but he somehow convinced me to be a 'fuck buddy'.   \n\n\nI went along with that because i'm really afraid of being alone but after a few nights of that i just wanted to cuddle and feel like anyone cared. he left me after i said no to sex and i got really messed up and ended up talking to a suicide hotline (I've dealt with suicidal thoughts since i was 10). after that he said he always loved me and wanted to be with me  (even though the day before he said he was only dating me because of sex.). So we got back together again and then he started his usual antics again and wouldn't let me say no. The one night i held my ground and said no. he would just whine and pout because he really wanted to. eventually i just gave up and said \"fine do whatever.\" just to make him shut up. and he said \"but you have to say yes.\". i don't remember much after that.   \n\n\nI blocked a lot of that time out and eventually my older friend came out to visit and i told her everything and she helped me break up with him. and that should have been the end. 2 days afterwards he kept talking to me and asking why. I told him how he was hurting me and said \"guys naturally want sex and don't really think when they want it.\" or \"all guys are just horny all the time.\" trying to justify why he didn't stop when i said stop. he said a lot of things like that and said he wanted to take care of me like a dad. it all just grossed me out.   \n\n\neventually i blocked him. but then my mom's boyfriend had a birthday party and he came over. i spent most of the night in my room and went out for a tiny bit just to be pissed off at him and maybe he'd get the hint to leave. after that i had a full on mental breakdown in my room and just couldn't breathe. I cried super hard until i exhausted myself and fell asleep. that bastard somehow found a way to message me and say something along the lines of \"i will always love you and you were so beautiful last night. i don't care if you ever love me blah blah blah sorry i was a dick.\" i lost it and called him all sorts of names cuz made me super angry that he never has to live with what he did and i have to.   \n\n\nthe next time i was drinking i got a bit too drunk and messaged him angrily and he tried to justify his actions through a self diagnosis of Aspergers. i stopped talking to him after that but i get really really angry whenever  i think about what went down and anything to do with him. it feels weird cuz i've never been angry at any of my other abusers..   \n\n\ncurrently, i'm trying to undo damage and get comfortable being sexual again and working on a relationship with someone who actually cares about my boundaries and listens to me (he's also a survivor.). Sorry for the long post but i kept having flash backs and needed to write it down somewhere. Thanks for reading if you did and again sorry if i triggered anyone i just really wanted to write this somewhere. Also sorry if my stories aren't enough to count... it's just they've been pretty traumatic to me. thanks again :) ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

When i moved to the city i found a temp job at a popular old school strop club. Waitressed, worked 2 or 3 6/7hr shifts a week and made roughly 4-8g a month. I am not very materialistic and I\u2019m good at saving. I paid down some of my debts financed a car and lived a good life traveling and what not. Started hanging out with this dancer and eventually met her dealer friend. We got it off. His house became the hangout spot because free weed and a few blocks from the club. It\u2019s hard to stay sober st the club or keep a distance. If your not involved enough you get treated different. Idk. It\u2019s a shitty environment but big money fast even if your not taking off your clothes or sucking dick. I\u2019m not good at casually dating. I had just ended a relationship and i have a dumb high libido and he seemed chill enough for a fab situation. I\u2019ve done it before and it\u2019s always worked out. Fast forward 6 months and i haven\u2019t spoken to my friends in months. Quit my job. Sold my car. Spend every second walking on eggshells trying not to fuck up. My family loves him. He\u2019s so nice. He takes care of me. Treats me great. It\u2019s weird though. He doesn\u2019t have interest in sex with me even when I\u2019m desperate enough to try it\u2019s always a no. He watches a lot of porn with girls that look nothing like me. Idk. I get hit on fairly often. Still do even though i don\u2019t wear makeup and now dress pretty baggy. I used to feel great about myself. Now i wonder if something\u2019s wrong with me all the time. He won\u2019t touch me but he\u2019s always accusing me of sleeping with someone else. Glance at someone, I\u2019m cheating. It\u2019s so confusing. A majority of the time i spend wondering how i got so ugly for someone to not even be interested in me. It drives me nuts that i can\u2019t stop obsessing over it now. I feel stupid. When we start arguing if I\u2019m quick enough sometimes i can start voice recording on my phone before he notices. A few times I\u2019ve had to stay home because of the bruises. A few times i honestly thought I\u2019d die. Every time i tell him this is toxic and i want to break up he gets angry. We fight. Sometimes I\u2019m so exhausted i just scream I\u2019m sorry and tell him i love him and if we stop fighting I\u2019ll forget everything. It\u2019s humiliating but i have kids. At first it was just pushing and shoving now it\u2019s throwing me around, rage and violence, and not to mention stalking me. Sometimes I\u2019m too afraid he\u2019ll lose control and kill me. I finally convince him to let me get a job. I don\u2019t have set break times although their often similar and i can\u2019t have phones at my desk. If he calls and i don\u2019t answer right away he immediately assumes I\u2019m with someone. He\u2019ll blow up my phone. There\u2019s been times where he\u2019ll drive the 40 mins to my work just to check on me. My building is completely secure. Can\u2019t even get into main entrance without a badge thankfully. Even so, how embarking is it to have him there threading to Cassie a scene if i don\u2019t come out. Thankfully he\u2019s never done anything. How embarrassing would it be to explain this to my boss. He\u2019s scary i don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll forever. I don\u2019t want i go out like that so i say sorry. My ex husband will let me stay with him. We get along. But my bf knows where he lives. One time i wouldn\u2019t let him in and he took a crow bar to the front door to pull me out. He has no limits. I don\u2019t have enough money save. I don\u2019t have friend or family here. I don\u2019t have anywhere to go where he won\u2019t find me. I don\u2019t have an alternate job lined up that\u2019s anywhere near as good as this one. I feel so sick being stuck. Where do i even begin?! He\u2019ll find me and he\u2019ll kill me for betraying him. Ive never let anyone treat me like this. I was a counselor for victims. I volunteered in homes to help people in this same situation. How the fuck did i not see this?! I can\u2019t leave my kids again, or my city or job. I have no vehicle or savings. I have mental disabilities and weed helps keep me sane. The only way i deal with being here is being high and he keeps me high. How do i get away and quit being an addict at the same time. It\u2019s too much. I\u2019m so lost. I wish i knew where to start. My ex husband has a house and the kids live with him. I\u2019m there often but he can manage without me. I just think if i leave he\u2019ll terrorize my family and then my kids are gonna wonder why i disappeared. We\u2019re not rich but they\u2019re good kids. We had a bad life. They\u2019re sheltered. I fuck up a lot but i always out my responsibilities first. Functioning addict or whatever. I can\u2019t leave them and my ex thinks I\u2019m over exaggerating. No one knows how dangerous he really is. Even with my bruises as proof I\u2019ve been manic all my life they just think I\u2019m exaggerating. This time I\u2019m serious. He\u2019s going to end up killing me. I had a fucked up life but I\u2019ve been a good person. I know I\u2019m stupid. Just leave is not a good answer it doesn\u2019t work like that. I\u2019m scared. Sometimes i feel like letting him just kill me because i can\u2019t take it anymore. I can\u2019t call the cops. I have no one. Please if you have any idea help me. I want to get out alive.

I'm struggling to keep away...", "author": "Ace-introvert", "self_text": "I was advised to post here after initially seeking guidance in Aspergers partners.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met a guy online we were friends, it developed into more. He was always very full on and messaging all the time, didn't think much of it at the time but the attention was flattering. I have fairly obvious self esteem issues which I expect didn't help. Anyway, I developed feelings for this guy and when he hinted at the same... things were good.\n\nThings got serious quickly (for him). I was always a cynic, quite cold hearted if anything but I think I provided a great challenge. I let this guy convince me love was good, to open myself to it whilst he showered me with affection. He was full of tales of past girlfriends treating him like dirt and I felt for him, I really did. Then I stupidly let my defences down. Fell hook, line and sinker.\n\nWe met for a second time (long distance) at his pleading and had a few fabulous hours and I was so happy.\n\nHe then mentioned he had a mild Aspergers diagnosis - showed me the reports about his difficulties forming relationships. Obviously I was at this point in too deep and besides his behaviour was proving quite the opposite. {I've previously sought guidance in the Aspergers support subs and was pointed in this direction and reassured his isn't ASD behaviour}\n\nThen overnight something changed. From constant contact he pulled away. No explanation.\n\nI reacted and asked what was going on.After some pushing he explained he was no longer capable of feeling love. He still wanted me and still liked me though.\n\nI told him to get lost. \n\nStupidly after a week I went crawling back. We built some form of a relationship up, mostly intimate. No love (on his behalf) but we were close.\n\nThen just as suddenly the intimacy died. I have a high drive and so the loss of this was worse than the loss of 'love' if I'm honest and my fragile self esteem broke.\n\nAgain I reacted. Again I ran. He still wanted to 'be with me though.' and like an absolute idiot I went back. No love, no sex. I was told I was too emotional and that it wasn't his place to make me happy.\n\noh and around this time I noticed photos appearing on social media of him and another woman. a friend apparently. One I'd never heard of. He no longer wanted to meet up with me, but was regularly going out with this woman. They both have profile photos taken by the other. Also he'd ignore me when out with her.  Why oh why did I let myself be hurt by this?\n\nRecently I had a milestone birthday and it became apparent he didn't know when it was, nor care. There would be no card, no gift. From someone I'd been in a relationship with for 18 months. I called him out. I ran. again.\n\nA few days later it was Christmas and feeling weak I sent a x (it was our thing) he sent one back.\n\nwe started talking and fell back into our old pattern and sure enough as soon as I'd given the power back to him, he pulled away again. This time he just wants to be friends.\n\nNeedless to say my story is condensed. I feel ridiculously used and broken. I have since been diagnosed with depression and am now taking medication to help with this. I know his behaviour isn't normal, I don't understand how anyone can think it's ok to treat another person like this?\n\nHaving read through this sub I can see why I was signposted here, although he never had any egotistical qualities so I'm not sure about the Narc thing?\n\nAnyway, we've not spoken for a few days and I'll be honest. I'm so tempted to make contact with him. My head knows this is a really dumb thing to do, but my heart - different story.\n\nI've obviously made a complete mess of my life over this guy and right now I'm not sure how to move on, why is my heart so damn forgiving?\n\nTalk some sense into me please.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

If you have the time to read it \nI still can't belive im almost over it \n\n*and im sorry for my english , its not my first language, so my grammar sucks ... but I'll try my best \nSo , I was in a work/love relationship with this guy. We dated for four years and after I broke up with him , we continued to work together for another 3 years. \nTo cut the story short how I got into the whole mess ,  it was hell for me since he was my boss.  \nAnyways we worked together in a band , did alot of gigs and shows , and we were pretty succesfull. \nHe was like a leader of the band , I was the main singer, frontwoman and writer.  Wich made him hate me alot for all the attention I was getting (even acuseing me for stealing his \"spotlight\") . I got into that band when I was 17 so all the things i learned in life i learned from him. I saw him (sadly) as a kind of a father figure since he was 11 years older than me. \nI was allready bad in school and the relationship i had  with my parents  only got worse plus I didnt have any friends, and the situacion with him and the band made friendships literally impossible in the future  from all the work and tavelling we did (plus the constant attention he was seeking from me and the constant cheking where i was etc etc) \nSo years later after i got out of all that mess and got my life back together \nI learend that I was dealing with something called \"covert narcissim\" \nI guess all of you probably know what that is so i dont need to explain too much. \nBut the torture he made me go though has left me with severe depression (wich i was allready struggeling with before i got into the band)  and anxiety \nIm talking about constantly condenseding me ,, telling me straightforward that im stupid and worthless , bashing my potential friends , not letting me sleep if i have something important to do in the morning (even if we have to record a music video together in the morning , he wpuld not let me sleep so i would look like shit in the morning and he would blame me how my \"slouchy behaviour is desrrupting the shooting\" , that gave him such joy to scold me like i was a kid )  , telling me that im not a kind of woman that leaves people in \"awe\" that im not a sensual woman (\"youre more like a buddy girl u know, thats nice ,but you, know nothing special\" thats what he said to me after 2 years of dating), telling me how to dress, blaming me for literally anything (\"if you did your makeup faster , we would have skipped the rain and now we have to go though rainy weather and ill ruin my shoes, youre so spoiled \" yup he said that) and overall making me seem completly crazy with all of the condradicting situacions he himself induced. He also contorlled my money and my earnings from the gigs and albums we sold, so thats another reason i sateyed with him for so long. \nBut I  knew that there was something terribly wrong here , but i just couldn't see it. But as you know.. You slowly accept these behaviours and in the end you dont even know what  is good or bad . These manipulators know how to hit the right notes so you dont notice that you're being abused for years.  \n I knew that it seems very strange that im being accused for everything, and that nothing that i do is right . The worst part was that i couldnt talk about that to anyone ,  nobody belived me. Apperently he senced that i was going to went somewhere so he told the rest of the band how \"crazy i was\". He had a differend persona for the public , a nice, kind, smart, trustwordy persona. So people really thought that I was this crazy mean bitch.\nThat gradualy destroyed myselfesteem so i completley shut down.  \nIm not gonna go through all the major stuff this post is allready long as it is, but you get the idea \n\n\nThe thing that saved me was litteraly the faculty i enrolled in later (wich he was very angry about , but also he liked to condesend and make fun of  me for not having a higher academic degree ) bacause it made me finally stand up for myself and find my self worth. But the worst part for him was that \nI was starting to engage with other people. I acted the way I allways do , and i soon realised the only problem i have socialy .... Is with him.  \nNobody in the academy thought i was a mean crazy bitch. And i was supprised how easy i can talk to people and how nicely everybody responded. \n I broke up with him a year later , and it was hell \nUntil he calmed down. \nBut the torture continued since we still worked together. \n\nWe went on and made a coupple of hit songs together , did some really big major festivals and what not ( he had a habit of booking the gig in a city 500 km from our town , on the same day i had my final exams a coupple of times , somehow I managed to do all of those ... I dont know how .I pleaded him not to do that, that he can just book the gig for a day after or before my exam,  but he just said to me \"you gotta decide whats more important , the band or the academy, the fans and the managers  will be pissed, if you have the money to pay us ill skip the gig \" ... I did have major anxiety and panic attacks But the school was  too important for me , he hated me for that )  \n\nSo anyways , I had to hide the fact that i had a new boyfiend (even though i didn't at the begining , i was just minding my own buissnes and when he started pressuring me to tell him i said yes and he threw a major tantrum that lasted for days... So eveybody else was like... Why are you making him jealous ?.. I was devastated) , I wasnt allowed to invite my friends on our gigs.(plus they got more demotivated to come because they thought that the \"leader guy\" was a major buzz killer)  so i still felt quite lonley.  And the blaming just got worse and worse and more apsurd as the years went by. \n\nFinally one day after 3 years of severe nasty situacions and stress I decied that I want to leave the band. \nI was so scared because i considered the band to be my home and family .. Its the life i lived for seven years. I was also afraid that I wouldn't be able to support myself any loger financially. And since myself esteem was so low i didnt think i would be able to continue  to work  with anybody else because i thought that everybody (other musicians, producers and compores in town) thought i was crazy because he talked shit behind my back (he also said that i charge like a huge amounts of money just to show up on a rehersal... Wich was like.... I mean i just started laughing out loud when my friend told me) \n\n\nIn the meantime I decided to make myslef better and got into therapy (im.still working on my depression .. But im felling much more stable .. I have still have very bad moments that last .. But its getting better ) \nSo i was telling my councelour this story and she said that this sounds like \"covert narcissim\" \nI never tought that existed .. So i started reaserching... And omg.... \nI found everything out. The way he talked and the mind tricks he did and all the manipulation.. It was all revealed to me... And the slimey \"exterior persona \" he developed for other people ... I finnaly thought \"oh man.... Maybe im not crazy after all\"... \n\n\nSo the day i decied \" ok its enough\" i was scared shitless... I thought i was going to loose my career... That i was going to go broke... That ill never sing again.. \nPlus confronting him is the most mentally exausting thing in the world (and he knows it) \nBecause u cant have a decent disscusion with these people... It allways ends up kinda like its your fault  and how \"they will forgive you because they are so kind\" \n\nI was preparing for that conversation for months... \nAnd I studied all the little triggers he used to piss me off... And trained myself to stay calm and focused on my goal  and not engage into a looong dissusion about the small things he usually uses when thibgs are getring out of his control to confuse your attention and piss you off. (For example... \" so why do you wanna leave?... I mean im not supprised... Since your mother is such a sick person she wants you to be her little slave.. But i can allready see you are doing that..plus you are never going to get a job after that school .. That diploma is uselles... So hows your friend Tamara doing? Her photos suck.. .)  and you are just left with ... WHAT????? O.O \n\nSo the coversation lasted for four hours \nAnd let me tell you... It was exausting but rather fascinanting... \nMy hands were sweating like hell  and i was shaking so hard  trying not to burst into tears but i managed to keep my cool... \nI just kept telling myself,,, (no dont give in..... I want to leave the band and thats finall... Leave leave leave... Focus focus) \n\nBut the most fascinanting thing started happening ... \nAs i was being cool and calm through all the nasty things he was saying to me... \nHe basicly started changing tactics... But changing into different people before my very eyes ... He tried to be kind.. He was rough.. Than he was condesending.. Than nice again.. Then started praising me.. Than he started blaming me... Than he told me i was acttualy garbage... Then he cussed my whole family.. Than he told me he liked my sister... Then he told me we wants to take me to Rome.. Than he told me i was stupid... \nI mean he was acting like a complete crazy person...  And i was just like (just staaaay calm and whatwver he says... Youre leaving.... ) \n\nAnd in the end he told me \"so thats it... Youre really leaving \" as i was going to get my jacket... And than he turend around back at me with tears in his eyes... Wich you can clearly tell are fake as fuck... And i told him... \"What the hell are you trying to do... Thats not gonna work\" \nSo he just wiped them off and looked at me like nothing happened ... Blank expression... I thought to myself (you made the best decision in your life ) \n\nSo i left .. In peace i didnt try to fight with him or argue i was like \"ok whatever you say.. But im leaving\" \nSo i told him \"if you need help for the new album or any ideas write to me ill still help the band\" \nHe just noded and said goodbye \nA coupple of days later \nHe blocked me on all social media \nAnd restricted me to use the music we made  for future shows i might have (i can use the lyrics but not the tracks - since he arrange it and produce it )  \nBut anyways that day felt like I've concured a behemoth. \nHe's personality  breakdown was the most disturbing thing I ever seen. \nIt was a bad b movie scene with the bad guy dying in the end and going like \"ill give you gold and happiness,, please spare me ill make you rich and famous, ill bring your dead grandmother back\" \nAnd you go like... Yea right...  \n\n\nAnyways the band fell apart a year later after I left.. The new singer went drunk on stage and made a nasty scandal... So everybody was quite dissapointed , he dismanteled the band after that... And thats all i know \nAs for me \nMan i feel like ive lost a hundered punds of extra baggage .. I feel so free (i still have a lot of anxiety after everything) but I Do a lot of mini solo shows now \nAnd i am working on my overall wellbeing now \n\nDated a coupple.of more idiotic men,, but ive learend my lesson so i now know how to spot a needy creep in the beginning ..  \nIm still trying to shake everything off \nSince a year passed \nI miss the gigs with the guys (they of course dont want to talk to me now)  \nBut im working very hard to get back on the big stage \n\nThank you so much if you made it this far  \nAnd thank you for your time \n\nI would like to say something in the end \nWith the risk of sounding a little cheesy \nBut \nThe thing that helped me the most were my friends and my hobbies (therapy also helped a great deal) \nThey helped me to better understand myself and find my self worth \nThe road is hard \nBut if u are persistant you will surley find the right path for you \nThese people like to pray on kind and gentle people... Dont fall for the \"thats weak\" story because its not... But remember to always be kind and gentle to yourself first so you can also be  for others in a right and healthy way \n\nLove you guys \n\n\n\n\n\n ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

To save money, we stayed with my sister instead of pay for a hotel.\n\nHe was on his best behavior.  The man I fell in love with.\n\nWell, during the trade show, which is grueling standing for 12 hours for three days engaging total stranger to become customers.  I started to \"disappear\" in his opinion.\n\nI did.  I would see that the customer flow was slow, he was busy talking to someone, and I would just \"take a lap\" to relieve my back, and return 3 minutes later.\n\nOne time, he and I were talking to another vendor, and my husband joked that I \"go missing\" all the time.  The banter went on about me being secretive and he joked about suspicions of what I could possibly be doing.  Everyone knew it was a joke.  No, I wasn't banging a dude behind the display.  No, I wasn't smoking crack in the parking lot.  Haha.  It actually WAS funny.  Another reason why I love him - humor.\n\nSo I said, as if he were kindergartener, \"I have to use the washroom.  I'll be back in 3 minutes.  It's OK.  You'll be fine if I get off the leash.  You're a grown man.  You really don't need me to be within your eyesite 24/7.\"\n\nThe vendor we were joking with just started laughing.\n\nMy husband?  Not so much. He didn't respond.  He just looked away and suddenly found a customer to approach.\n\nYeah, honey.  Let that sink in.  YOU don't really NEED me to be in your control 24/7.  And both of us will be fine.

Relationship-wise it's been complicated. On and off for the last 36 years. Let me explain. \n\nMy parents divorced when I was about 1. I may or may not have visited him before I was 7, but that's all I can remember. I was sent to him usually during the summers for about a month as per the child custody arrangement. \n\nVisits were traumatic. He was an alcoholic and physically abusive to my stepmother during visits. At around age 13 I was able to choose not to visit. So, I didn't. I visited one more time when I was around 16. During that visit I helped my secretly move out while he was gone for a weekend. He pulled a gun on her and threatened to kill her. We escaped clean thankfully.\n\nLater in my life around age 30 (when I had my first child) I had realized I'd let go of a lot of my anger and bitterness towards him and invited him back into my life.\n\nSince then, despite the fact that I really do feel like I've forgiven him, I can't shake this strange dark feeling I always get when I hear his voice, or have to be with him. I never feel comfortable around him at all. \n\nI was sexually molested when I was 8. The same feelings I had with the perpetrator (a cousin) after that, are the same exact feelings I get with my dad. \n\nMy dad sexually abused my step sister as well.\n\nI deal with depression and anxiety on the daily. And more recently I've started trying to do things that serve me. I don't want a relationship with him anymore. But I feel awful because I don't know how to tell him that I don't want a relationship because I'm convinced that he sexually abused me as an infant. Or something. Something happened and every single time I hear his voice, see his name, have to be with him, I feel like there's a dark stone in my stomach. My heart races. My palms sweat. And I don't know why. I don't think want to. \n\nSo, what do I do? We haven't spoken in like 6 months which is normal because neither one of us make a huge effort to always keep in touch (and he's not on the internets). And now he's calling me. And I just freeze. I can't answer the phone. I'm completely door slamming him and I feel terrible about it. \n\nDo I just continue with a pseudo-relationship? Do I let it go?

Engaged to a 30-something male retail pharmacist for 2 years. \nEventually, we moved in together. He was used to a \"comfortable lifestyle,\" since his father owned a company and was involved with a Mexican drug cartel for a while until he went to jail for attempted murder. \n\nSo at the very beginning of our relationship, he would say things like, \"You're mine and I don't want to share you with anyone.\" Which I felt was a little flattering at the time, I never felt nor thought anyone would care THIS much for me. \nI had a male best friend whom I dated for about a month, years ago (2011) we decided we were better off as friends seeing as he didn't want to get married, have kids, and I did. My best friend was my rock for the longest time since I didn't have a great relationship with my parents, and was an only child, he had become what I felt like a chosen family member. My fiance felt that we had a \"sexual familiarity\" that he didn't feel comfortable with. I kept trying to reassure him that wasn't the case, as my friend would constantly \"bust my balls\" and get on my nerves, I still had a very platonic love for him. So I cut out my best friend and didn't talk to him to compromise with my fiance. \n\nMy fiance and I broke up twice in our time dating because he felt like I was lying to him about missing my ex-best friend, that my fiance should be my best friend. I mean, I did but I didn't feel like I was safe telling him that? (does that even make sense?) Seeing as I devoted all of my time in my romantic partner, I felt it was kinda unfounded. I dropped everything when he would call, I would take him food on my days off for his lunch hour (taking me an hour and a half round trip, several towns over). I paid for our vacations (something he couldn't compromise on was flying economy or staying at a much cheaper Airbnb rather than an expensive Rosewood hotel every time). I had 40k in savings I had accumulated before I met him, which wasn't bad seeing as I was only 25 and had been living with my mom before moving in with him. He promised that once he sold his home (which was valued at 500k -- he inherited it from his grandfather), I would get paid back in full to replenish my savings, since I was the one \"better with money\" my 401k and whatever he had left from selling the house would be all we needed to live off of when we retired. The house ended up needing repairs on the roof and air conditioning vent replacements, etc which I paid for. When I would try to say no to taking money out of my savings to pay for things he accused me of not being fully invested in the relationship, that I had one foot out of the door, waiting to leave. So I always obliged rather than start a fight. \n\nThis one instance I remember specifically... We were checking out a new venue that had an open floor for dancing, but the event we were in attendance at had just singing.\nI had told him about other people I had hung out with, about how I would go dancing classes to learn salsa and west coast swing since I had seen a class with some friends years before. He suddenly becomes quiet and says he wants to leave because he doesn't want to be reminded of men that I \"probably still want to sleep with\", dancing out on the dance floor over a hobby I don't practice anymore because he wasn't very comfortable doing it. We leave the venue in silence and had a big blow out fight about my past at home. Was this my fault? Should I have just not told him about something I didn't think mattered? It's not Like I was going into detail about the men I slept with before him. \nIt was at this point I had already felt very alone in the relationship. He had his friends he refused to cut out of his life, even to my behest. They're all late 20s, early 30s, no career prospects, like drinking, smoking, getting high at the house my fiance and I shared, which I hated coming home to after working a long shift. Not that I have a problem with what people do with their lives/bodies, I just didn't like coming home to what was essentially the morning after party frat house.\n\nEvery so often my then fiance would get \"a hankering\" for MDMA. This was frequently when he felt like socializing with his friends, I'd be okay with just spending time home alone for a night to myself. There were two times he came home with his friends, high off of what I later found out was molly cut with a little bit of meth. He didn't react well to it and spent 5 days in bed trying to sleep it off. I'd beg him not to do these things but he'd get angry with me, telling me I should love him regardless and unconditionally. I felt trapped. I didn't want him putting himself through getting sick, he shrugged it off, saying he would just take a Xanax and would feel better (he bought them from Mexico for his insomnia). Apparently voicing my concern over it was ridiculous, since he was a pharmacist and knew what he was doing. \n\nI keep replaying these and other scenarios over and over in my head. \nShould I have just gone with the flow? Am I just a stick in the mud? My friends have said I was abused and gaslighted, but the funny thing about being gaslighted is not trusting yourself or your judgment anymore...\n\nAnyway, I attached some screen caps, for a bit more... context??\nfirst, three screen caps are to a conversation about him feeling insecure about my past relationships.\nlast is during a break up we had, I wasn't able to reply right away seeing as I was at work.\n \nI just don't know and I just feel awful after all of this. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/IRCUNC6\n\nedit: typos/grammar.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I went NC and never, ever, ever plan on going back.\n\nI'm still struggling with flashbacks of the situations he put me through and they still boil my blood when I remember them. I want to bring up some situations that still haunt me, in the hopes that writing them will help get them out of my head.  \n\n\n1. We spent 2 years \"together\". In that 2 years, he did not tell me he loved me, not even once. About a year in, I told him I loved him. You could almost feel his ego grow in that moment. He refused to ever say it back to me. His justification was that I did not deserve it yet, because he had decided that I needed to convert to his religion. Then and only then would he say those three words. He would say \"I do have those feelings for you, but unless you convert you will never hear me say it\". I can't count the number of times I had conversations with him, crying my heart out and telling him how much it hurt. I now know that he never loved me, nor is he capable of loving anyone/anything. It still hurts to think about, I would say I love you, and his response would be \"same\" or \"thanks\", most times he wouldn't even acknowledge it. A little piece of me died each time. What a shit show.  \n\n2. I don't know why, but he was always insistent on biting, slapping or pinching me as hard as he could. I would wince and tell him when he'd be hurting me but he would refuse to stop. I was constantly covered in bruises because he would always take it too far, even though he insisted we were just \"playing around\". He would say \"I own you, so I can do what I want\". One night, after he had a little too much to drink, he kept sticking his fingers in my face which was just plain annoying. It was all fun and games, until I started waving my hands and fingers back in his face (we're just playing around, right?). He proceeded to slap me as hard as he could across the face. I was dumbfounded. How did we go from being \"playful\", but the moment I play along he decides to snap? He turned the entire situation around on me and stonewalled me. I ended up crying/apologising all night, while he just turned over and went to sleep.  \n\n3. Any boundaries I had were stripped away and burnt to smithereens. He monitored my every move, had complete access to everything on my phone. He would go as far as to check my spam emails, I have no idea what he was hoping to find. He would check my online banking, and then quiz me on where/why I spent $20, or why I felt the need to withdraw cash. This was my money, that I work hard for, that had nothing to do with him. Eventually I stopped going shopping unless it was absolutely necessary because he was so exhausting to deal with. Any time I wanted to use his phone for anything, he would blow up. He would claim that I clearly don't trust him and that I was invading his privacy (the irony). At one point, I was looking for a new job, and he told me he had a great opportunity lined up for me. He handed my resume in to this company and I got the job. I then found out that his father worked there as the head security guard, and he decided to pick up shifts there too. He and his father would watch me on the security cameras. He would quiz me on who I would talk to, what I would wear, pretty much anything and everything. His father would keep constant tabs on me. He openly admitted this to me. His words were \"you can't be trusted, you are just like a child. I'm doing this for you\". I was constantly interrogated about my every single move. I felt like a prisoner. I ended up completely isolated. The day I ended our relationship, I also quit that job.  \n\n4. As I mentioned prior, he woke up one day and decided that it was absolutely imperative that I convert to his faith, should I want our relationship to last. He became completely and utterly fixated on this. For reference, my background is mediterranean, but I'm a born and bred Aussie. He too was born in Aus, but came from a different background to me. He would belittle my background every single day. He would tell me how much he and his family despise \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ people, etc etc. Constant jabs. I would always tell him \"you knew my background before we started dating, so if it is that big of an issue for you, why are you dating me?\". He never had anything to say back to me that wasn't racist, rude or just straight out stupid. For the most part, I ignored it thinking that he was just trying to get a reaction out of me. When I eventually met his family, I realised that they all shared these same \"opinions\", not just about people who share my background, but toward anyone who was of different faith/background to them. In their eyes, they were the supreme humans, the rest of us aren't so lucky. How sad. When I would go to his home, he and his family would speak the language of their people (even though they all speak perfect english), to which I couldn't understand a single word. One day I, politely, said \"It's a little rude to speak in a different language and exclude me like that, and make no effort to even involve me in the conversation. You wouldn't like it if I did that to you.\" He and his mother both agreed that if I wanted to be part of the conversations, I would have to learn the fucking language. They continued to exclude me and laugh/chat as a family while I would awkwardly sit there. Eventually, I stopped going over. By the end of our time together, I became completely numb. I stopped reacting to all of the stupid shit he would say because I had completely run out of energy. He obviously picked up on this because for 2 weeks straight, he only referred to me as a \"stupid little (insert racial slur here)\".  \n\n\nTo anyone who has read this far, thank you.   \nTo anyone who is currently experiencing anything similar, I'm so sorry. I believe in you and your recovery and I am here if anyone would like to talk.\n\nWhat I can say is that even though these flashbacks still occur, every aspect of my life has improved significantly. It gets better, I promise. Some days are easier than others. Some days are really tough. But it DOES get better. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It keeps me up at night, I am scared more children can be hurt.\n\nI don't even know when it began. The abuser was always the same, but the abuse evolved over the years. Here is what happened, sorry it is going to be long...\n\nWhen I was born my parents lived away from their families and worked all day. I started kindergarden at 3 months old. When they erre able to move closer to their families each side would take turns taking care of me. I was a much more open and smiling child when I was with my mother's side, when I started talking, which wasn't much time after our family moved I told my parents what was going on. My father's brother was beating me up, everytime I was in the house. My grandmother would be in the house with us and do nothing to stop it. My parents immediatly forbade me to stay over with them and inrolled me in school again, my grandparents from my mother's side, who worked shifts, as did my parents, would pick me up and drop me at daycare everyday.\n\nFor years everything was fine. I was a smart child, not very sociable, but had my close group of friends. I loved drawing, singing, animals. I wanted to be a vet and my grades were great, even being granted an award by the district (good students from that district was not very commun...).\n\nThen when I was around 10 or 11 my parents got divorced, and that's when it started again. At first it was fine. My dad was always around, so nothing happened. Then he started dating and I was left for second plan. He would leave me alone with his brother for hours. That's when he started to, what now I know was grooming me.\n\nI wont go into detail into what it was exactly but what it disturbed me most was when we went to visit extended family and my 6 year old cousin asked me some weird questions about what he'd when we were alone. He hadnt tried to touch me... Yet\n\nA couple of months later I don't remember why the hell I was alone with him in the house but I was. I just remember that I ran outside to the yard crying. The fences and the walls to the street and the neighboors were high so I remember that I sat in a spot I knew people could see from outside and I just sat there crying for a good time, waiting for my dad. His brother came and tried to get me to go inside, but at the time I had a small dog that was on the yard with me and he didn't let him get anywhere near me.\n\nBy the time my dad arrived with his now wife I was just numb, siting on the floor petting the dog. I didn't tell him what happened. I didn't tell anyone for years. I only told two of my best friends and a ex-boyfriend.\n\nI refused to see the family from my father's side anymore. He would force me, but I would have panic attacks and we'd have to come home sooner. I didn't get along with his wife either, so since the age of 15, I haven't talked with him or seen him.\n\nMy grades began to drop, I stopped singing, I would spend days in my room. I developed an eating disorder, and I had depression. My mum just thought I was being a moody teen. She never knew and she still doesn't know. I could never get it together again, I never got to be a vet.\n\nI let it ruin me. My life went completly downhill. And then I remember my cousin with that talk, those questions... I was a child, yes, but I was 12, she was 6, and I know he used to visit that side of the family quite often. Plus I have other cousins that he can get access to as well. I am so scared something might have happened to them as well, and I don't know what to do. It has been more than 13 years since it happened to me, I am scared of people not believing me, or ignoring it?? \n\nI hope I am only exagerating and it was a one time thing. I need to believe that.

He never let me forget that I slept with someone else and that it hurt him. Yes, opening the relationship was my idea; we were HS sweethearts and our sex hurt me a lot, so I was hoping to have one night of good sex before marrying him and resigning myself to years of painful loveless sex out of duty to the relationship. But he had agreed to open it\u2014and then used it against me forever.\n\nI always felt *so* guilty about sleeping with someone, because he had said he didn\u2019t sleep with anyone else during that time because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t imagine\u201d having sex with anyone else because he loved me too much. He said he had gone out one night to try to find someone to take home but never went through with it, that he looked around at all the other girls and no one else could compare to me\u2014it just made him too sad to even contemplate sex with someone else\u2014which of course made me feel really bad, because I *did* have sex with someone else and thus \u201ccould imagine\u201d having sex with another person, and so obviously this meant I didn\u2019t love him as much as he loved me. He made it clear that it hurt him and cried croc tears.\n\nI apologized for this during the entire remaining 5 yrs of our relationship after long-distance ended and we went back to being monogamous, even though I hadn\u2019t cheated and had been honest about my desire to open the relationship for those months, and while he didn\u2019t seem thrilled, he had agreed without a fight, so I thought everything was okay. I had done nothing ethically wrong, but he made me feel so guilty because he always brought it up as something I did that hurt him, and had to make up to him. I can\u2019t even count how many times I said I was sorry for having sex with this other man. \n\nWell, of course it occurs to me now that he probably did sleep with someone else and was just lying to make sure I felt terrible about my own sex so he could use it against me. Either that, or he just didn\u2019t care to have sex because sex is just about power for him (he never seemed to really enjoy it with me, which is sad because it hurt and I did it for him only). Or maybe during his drinking binges he was just cheating. \n\nWho even knows what he really did during that time! Or any other time we were apart. The point is that this \u201ccan\u2019t imagine sex with anyone but you\u201d bullshit was an obvious lie to gain more power over me. I really screwed myself over. Not only could he use my sex with another man as this ridiculous trump card in any fight we had, no matter what it was about, but also use it to pressure me into having sex with him I didn\u2019t want in one of his fucked up power games with me. For five years he held this one sexual partner over me, all on the lie that he couldn\u2019t imagine sex with anyone but me.\n\nMy therapist said \u201cIt sounds like he was fucking with your head.\u201d\n\nJesus take the wheel, I was so stupid.

This went on for pretty much all our relationship, and if I think about it, it happened like...once a month. Once every 3 or so weeks. I was always happy to have them back, and about 80% of the time, they were the one to talk to me again. Sometimes I initiated it but a lot of the times he spoke to me.

And then he told me \"I want to try living a normal life.\" (He had a uhhhh, slightly? different early 20s cause of his job/interests) He started school again this past week and he told me he went on a date with someone. And that I will only get over him if he gets with someone else. But it hurts a lot because why am I not good enough? And better yet, why does he get to decide to be normal with minimal effort?

Like if I was prettier, or looked like his ex who he still contacts, or if I was just better, he\u2019d still want me. Even to use. Whatever it is, he\u2019d still want me. All the things he loved ive lost. And it was from this relationship. \n\nA lot of it I worry about is looks. Because i was so different from the girls he was always looking at. \n\nBt what\u2019s even weirder is he was really clear about why he lost feelings. It was because I was always complaining, starting drama, arguing, bringing up shit he did etc. He told me that so many times and still I focus on being unattractive or just not good enough. What is wrong with my brain?\n\nGuys have never stuck around. They\u2019re all over me at first. But when they get what they want from me they lose interest. I\u2019m starting to feel like I just don\u2019t have the value or I\u2019m not worth keeping. Because they\u2019ll sleep with me, or have me as a rebound, or a shoulder to cry on, and then they leave me. Always. They lose interest in me and never want to stay. Obviously I turn them off. \n\nNo one asks me out either. \n\nAnd my friends say \u201cyou\u2019re just meeting the wrong people\u201d but it\u2019s every guy I\u2019ve met.

Relationship-wise it's been complicated. On and off for the last 36 years. Let me explain.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was about 1. I may or may not have visited him before I was 7, but that's all I can remember. I was sent to him usually during the summers for about a month as per the child custody arrangement.\n\nVisits were traumatic. He was an alcoholic and physically abusive to my stepmother during visits. At around age 13 I was able to choose not to visit. So, I didn't. I visited one more time when I was around 16. During that visit I helped my secretly move out while he was gone for a weekend. He pulled a gun on her and threatened to kill her. We escaped clean thankfully.\n\nLater in my life around age 30 (when I had my first child) I had realized I'd let go of a lot of my anger and bitterness towards him and invited him back into my life.\n\nSince then, despite the fact that I really do feel like I've forgiven him, I can't shake this strange dark feeling I always get when I hear his voice, or have to be with him. I never feel comfortable around him at all.\n\nI was sexually molested when I was 8. The same feelings I had with the perpetrator (a cousin) after that, are the same exact feelings I get with my dad.\n\nMy dad sexually abused my step sister as well.\n\nI deal with depression and anxiety on the daily. And more recently I've started trying to do things that serve me. I don't want a relationship with him anymore. But I feel awful because I don't know how to tell him that I don't want a relationship because I'm convinced that he sexually abused me as an infant. Or something. Something happened and every single time I hear his voice, see his name, have to be with him, I feel like there's a dark stone in my stomach. My heart races. My palms sweat. And I don't know why. I don't think want to.\n\nSo, what do I do? We haven't spoken in like 6 months which is normal because neither one of us make a huge effort to always keep in touch (and he's not on the internets). And now he's calling me. And I just freeze. I can't answer the phone. I'm completely door slamming him and I feel terrible about it.\n\nDo I just continue with a pseudo-relationship? Do I let it go?

He wouldn\u2019t take his shirt off even to get in a pool. And towards the end of our relationship he didn\u2019t want to do anything adventurous because he was afraid of everything, he was afraid of what people thought of him and became overly paranoid. \n\nHe told me I embarrassed him in front of his family/friends and told me he didn\u2019t like my outfits. He would make comments on my make-up or any other physical flaws I had. I didn\u2019t realize this was devaluing at the time. They were subtle comments. And they were usually made in situations where I couldn\u2019t easily fight back or felt powerless or felt it was inappropriate to do so, like at his dads funeral for example, when I felt guilty walking out even though I was so angry at what he said. Or usually at a family gathering or on some trip we took together where I couldn\u2019t just walk away from him, I felt like I had to face him and be an adult and \u201cget over it\u201d and let it go or the rest of the day would just be awkward because I\u2019d be stuck with him. \n\nAnd I always thought he was the insecure one, and he was.

I knew that if I wanted to leave my Narc for good, I would need help, and my parents are the help I will need.  I've tried and failed to leave her in the past, and, part of my problem is, is that I hide the truth from people around me, pretend things are okay, just so people will accept us as a couple again.  By telling my parents, I've basically solidified my fate and ended things for good with her.  Even if I really badly want to get back together with her, I can never be with someone that my parents won't accept.\n\nTomorrow I'll pack up my things and go back to live with them for a while until I'm ready to live on my own again.

My dad bailed shortly after they got married and moved abroad leaving me with her. She's practically the only family I've known as mom wasn't close to her family. So our relationship has been sort of insular with rarely any outside intervention. my mom has been the very religious sort. too religious i would say.\n\nshe actually preaches as a \"divine calling\". this was circa 2004. she's barely worked a real job since then. we've managed to survive &amp; she's put me through high school but there are times when it's really bad and we go hungry. but when there are good times those are good times too.\n\n so over the years as i grew up and started to be independent and find myself my mom and i would fight. A LOT . little things at first then misunderstandings then it'd get worse.  when i was 9 she said and i quote\"you've been with me for 9 years. go look for ur father and spend the other 9. when u;re 18 find ur way. I've had enough\"\n\nwhen i was 8 i went to a friend's house cos i wanted to do homework and we had had no electricity in the house for 2 weeks. i got back home around 7:30 ish pm. when i returned my mom had locked me out of the house and said to go back to where i came from. needless to say i didn't understand. i didn't have a  phone at that age to inform her and i made the decision in school. i hadn't planned it beforehand.\n\nFor over 30 mins she refused to let me in. i could never forget this memory. it was dark and i was on the ground crying cos i was hungry and just wanted to go into the house. mosquitoes were biting me and my uniform was all a mess.\n\nmoving on, when i was 12 my father got back into our lives. he wasn't even trying hard to be a better father. the most he did was give me chump change and buy me clothes that were too tight or too loose. and she did nothing. she didn't demand alimony yet constantly complained about our financial state and how awful he treated her.\n\n*\\[there would be times where'd she say stuff and when u confront her she acts like it never happened or she'll rephrase to sound better\\]*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhe chipped in a bit for junior high but then completely disappeared when it came to senior high. so we were left on our own. i was never the best student. my mom never took interest in my school work or anything. i pretty much went to school came home ate and watched tv. no guidance nothing. all she did was pray and read the bible and rinse and repeat. she was a fanatic i've come to realise. if you've ever seen Carrie 2013, Julianne Moore portrays this perfectly well. all she did and think and breathe was the bible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthere have been times where in a fit of rage i start to cuss or yell or retort back in anger to her words and she'd start casting out a demon. calling me a \"foul spirit\".  telling me cos i don't like to pray I've allowed the enemy to enter me and use me against her. \n\nshe's said stuff like i'm the reason her life is at a standstill. when i was really young in grade school i don't remember what i said or did but what i DO remember is that she asked why I and my father cannot give her\"breathing space\". that ever since she had me she has not been free. \n\nat 18 she kicked me out. reason? i  hadn't washed plates. actually the dishes were in the sink and i was in the middle of laundry so wanted to do that first before cos of the sun. she yelled why i have made her a slave in her own house and i got angry and retorted that i don't expect her to do MY dishes. after all i do hers all the time without complaining. it escalated and long story short she said she wants me to leave cos she's had enough.\n\n said that from that day onward she doesn't have a son anymore.  calling her bluff i did just that . took my backpack with a few clothes and walked for 10 hours in slippers to a friend's house in the next town. i got  there around 4am but cos they were asleep waited till 7am to knock on the door. they took me in but that didn't last long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na week later exactly, she shows up cos she knows said friend and this is where everything gets so fucked up and complicated. my friend's mom outed me to her cos she said she had visions of me having sex with a penis and she was in tears as if somehow it was my fault. she looked at me with so much disappointment in her eyes. that was a horrible day. she said she came to take me back but i said i wanted to stay but i did go back to get my other clothes and laptop and phone which i had left behind. i lived with them for about 2-3 montths. during that time she'd call nonstop to check up on me, she'd send me religious texts over Whatsapp even though i told her to stop and that i wasn't interested. when i ignored her she'd send messages through my friend's phone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nliving with them didn't last long. i had to move back in with her for some time till christmas 2015 after which i left once again. having nowhere to go i went to live with a woman as a houseboy essentially. cleaning, picking up trash, washing for her, running errands. it was all so bleak. i didn't talk to her for over a month cos i couldn't stand her. i figured this was better that staying home and feeling like a shame and problem. in jan of 2016 she called several times. i ignored her. 22-23 calls in total. when i had enough, thinking perhaps there was an emergency this is what she said\" Why are you doung this to me? what have i ever done to you?\"\n\n i thought to myself what a bitch. i got livid in that moment and incredulously asked \"what am I doing to YOU?\" i was so angry. i should have been in college. people told me how smart and hardworking i was. and here i am cleaning someone's toilets for room and board. all because of a shitty mom. after 3 months this woman i was with was becoming overbearing. she was difficult to deal with but cos she wasn't my mom i didn't' really care. i was used to being yelled at and belittled. i moved back in with my friend's family. shortly after they traveled abroad and it was just me. cleaning, taking care of their house for a fee. life was ok. not long after they returned i sensed something was different. weeks later  my friend's family said that i was lazy and wasn't working so they wouldn't pay me and that i had to go. And that o ate all their food. Firstly nooo. I ate their leftovers and drank the coffee and tea no one touched. My friend did nothing. said nothing.\n\nthis wasn't true. i worked very hard. i'd wake as early as 4 am to study something then by 6 i start chores. i'd work till 11-12noon where i'd eat and take a break. my friend would have breakfast in her home the minute she woke up. i would go hungry for hours. and yet i was the lazy one. around this time she got a job and boyfriend and was having fun so would barely acknowledge me. i was literally like a slave in their home except that i could watch tv.\n\nit came time for me to go and having nowhere to turn to i rang my mom up to ask her to let me in. i regret that very much now. she acted like having me back was no problem. the night i got back in she woke me up 4 hours later. berating me that the things i used to do before she wouldn't stand for them. if i think i am here to distract her I've got another thing coming. mind u on this day i had gotten a stupid job as a receptionist at a motel so needed some sleep before my day but i didn't have any. she just reamed me out. talking down to me saying how they've used me up and left me and now i'm back here after all.\n\nliving with her was a struggle. i lost that job after 2 moths and fell into a deep depression cos my life seemed pointless. not like it hadn't before . for a month i was just....\n\nI stopped talking with my friend cos i was bitter and angry. she did nothing to help me. just going about her stupid job and boyfriend. i had no one else to turn to. it was a dark month. anyway soon i got a job as a cashier at a supermarket which helped for a bit but she would constantly nag me. i was there for 4 moths until i couldn't do it again. the pay was shit. i was overworked and exhausted even though i was very good at the till and was well liked my colleagues and customers alike. \n\nfew months later my extended family from her side got into contact with us and said they'd help send me to university. in the meantime we'd been fighting practically every. single. day. so i got yet another job just so i could get out of the house. at this point i had a crime related problem which i do not wish to get into but anyway the job kept me busy until uni started. i couldn't get a place on campus cos i was working a lot and had no time to secure myself lodging so i thought i reasoned with her to stay till christmas and then get a place the following year. she said she agreed and that it was no issue. \n\n\\[this reminds of a time when i asked for money  to print an assignment at a cyber cafe. i came home late so didn't show the assignment to her. the next day when i went too her for  pocket money she refused to give me until i produced the assignment. and i stupidly placed it in one of my books at the bottom of my backpack. the taxi driver sending me to school as honking cos i was already late and she was just yelling at me that i think i can spend her money anyhow and just some random shit i don't even remember all that well\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*over the years she'd call me weak as well*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit became an issue when the fights started again . this time she claimed i had aligned myself with her family to destroy her. a little background on my mom. she's mostly uneducated. she had some job in hospitality years ago but nothing major to write home about. she's always believed her family are into the occult and destroyed her marriage to destroy her\"star\" her destiny, that's what she calls them . \"star hunters\"\n\nat one point i believed her. then she blamed my father and his people. then a family friend. then her sister. then my friend. always blaming people. claiming they are out to get her.\n\nunderstandably i got fed up and frustrated. i realised she was most likely paranoid but i could't prove it. when i was 13 i had a towel wrapped around my waist in my bedroom and was listening to music on a portable dvd player. my mom burst in ripped the towel from my waist and said she hopes i'm not masturbating. i was shocked. i don't think i even knew what masturbation was at that age.\n\nanyway moving on i got tired of the fighting so called up my grandma to pls get me money for a hostel. it was late in the sem but i just could not do it at home anymore. she'd say all sort of mean untrue things. i was possessed. i was a prostitute. a thief. a this a that. and i'd get angry and retort making me look equally insane.\n\nexasperated i once yelled \"with a mother like u why wouldn't i be insane\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ncurrently  i'm in my second year of college. i'm depressed and sad cos of my home life and the fact that i'm gay and don't feel like i fit in or belong in this world. i recently had feelings for someone who never returned them and pretty much ignored me when i came out to him. i felt so crushed. all the friend's i make treat me like shit. all i do is try to love people but they always ignore, neglect or abandon me. \n\nit doesn't even matter how hard i work or how good i am . i never seem to get anything good in life. i'm always sad and second best.\n\ni asked her recently that if i dropped out of uni and never took a dime from her and her family would she then be happy? and she said no. but i am tired of this  woman. i'm tired of this world. i'm just done. i don't want to live anymore. there's nothing to live for. i live in a homophobic country so no one can ever love me. i have no money to go abroad for a better life. i suck at school. My LIFE literally has no meaning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni guess my question is....am i really a horrible person with bad luck or was i a victim f emotional abuse and am i suffering it's effects-depression, low self esteem, trouble forming relationships.

As I have ADHD moving will be a huge distraction and I need to focus on the biz. \n\nWe are going on a long scheduled cruise in a month and he\u2019s tripping along, love bombing me. I am meanwhile just playing along. \n\nUntil tonight. This man has serious boundary issues with stuff. Organizing closets, throwing my shit out. Apologize and do it again. Always justified. \n\nTonight I discovered he\u2019d thrown out the fudge my mother made me for the holidays and which I expressly said: do not throw away. \n\nHe threw it away. Then we had a huge fight and YAY THERAPY. because I could see him gaslighting me: denying, justifying, insulting, threatening me. I laughed at him. I said nope. I just kept coming back to the fact that the fudge was MINE. and he has no jurisdiction over MY THINGS.\n\nHe called me all kinds of names. Demeaned my business, belittled all my hard work. \n\nFinally I took a deep breath and said: you have until 90 days after our cruise to get your shit together or I am out. I have saved enough money. I don\u2019t need this shit. I am not angry and it\u2019s not an idle threat. And when I am gone I am gone. \n\nNow he\u2019s begging for forgiveness. Nope, I said.

I just recently realized he\u2019s actually a narc. Maybe not full blown but definitely shows a lot of attributes. \n\n6 months into our relationship he borderline emotionally cheated on me. Long story short, he said it wasn\u2019t technically cheating and I stayed after months of progress and work on our relationship. There was a few minor upsets as well in between. As far as I know that is done. \n\nWe participated in couples therapy(and by us he went to one session and made fun of it) and I continued until recently where I felt well enough to move forward with things. It was through therapy I realized I\u2019m a codependent and he is obviously the narc. \n\nOverall, our relationship had made me pretty happy but in moments I get so angry knowing that I let him get away with things he does. He\u2019s so charming, sweet and so many other things I love and in other ways I smh at things he does/says. His comments, his apathy towards life and other humans. Question why I\u2019m with him even. Lately Ive been doing more questioning. \n\nI\u2019ve had a rough few months and a lot of transitions in my life, work, moving, family drama, etc. Last week my car broke down after my tire blew and I almost got into an accident after what was a stressful few days for me beforehand. I asked him to come over because I just \u201cneeded him\u201d and wanted to feel better after a rough few days. He told me he was tired and didn\u2019t want to make the drive. I later found of he went to a sporting event and drove further than he would of had to go to see me. He told me after and shrugged it off. But god forbid I get pissed because I\u2019d be the psycho taking my bad day out on him? And yes, somehow I apologized to him for all this.\n\n\nScenario two... a few weeks ago I had a terrible day at work and found out my dad was diagnosed with cancer. I told him and his response was that he was hanging with his friend and I was looking for attention because I like to have him all to myself. Or something like that. He actually apologized not realizing the severity of things but then later rubbed it in my face probably every single thing I\u2019ve ever not done for him when he needed me(which I thought I do everything for him and I\u2019m always there?)\n\nScenario number three... I asked him if I could get some stuff delivered from work to his house because it would save my workplace money and I saw no big deal as he doesn\u2019t have to lift a finger and just let something get mailed to his house. We both live in border cities and for the stuff to get shipped here it would cost way more. Since I\u2019m there a few times a week my manager kindly asked if it would be okay to just pick it up there and they wouldn\u2019t have to pay an arm and leg for shipping to another country when I can just bring it home with me. I didn\u2019t see the issue and I care lots about my job so when I asked my bf last week he made some joke about charging my boss or taking a cut to me. I shrugged it off and told my boss it was fine because he just likes to joke around lots(which he does, always). So when the stuff got delivered today he started freaking out on me telling me I needed to pay him for something literally just bring dropped off there. I thought this was absolutely ridiculous. I told him we wouldn\u2019t of asked  knowing he would charge us which is the whole reason we did it in the first place. He requested I tell me boss to pay him or he\u2019s holding the supplies hostage. I feel totally awkward now and don\u2019t know what to do... mind you he knows I\u2019m really struggling financially atm.\n\nDaily he makes snarky comments on how \u201ccrazy\u201d or sensitive I am about things. If I get upset about anything I\u2019m automatically the bad person in our relationship to ruin things. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I just suck it up... no matter how pissed I am. I\u2019ll lie to save yo argument even. Let him win every time. Because I feel like saying anything will cause him to emotionally cheat on me again and I\u2019ll ruin us. In ways he\u2019s actually made me a much stronger and more emotionally tolerant person but I want to be able to speak my mind freely. \n\nI am by no means a psycho, naggy, raging person. I know me and I know I\u2019m kind, caring and nurturing. I don\u2019t understand how he makes me out to be so shitty at times. I\u2019ve dropped so many things in my life to be there for him. To suck his ass. I feel like more and more that this is one sided and my energy is being drained from me. I love him but I\u2019m now realizing he\u2019s not as great as I thought he was. I just feel too far gone to turn back now. He means so much to me but I feel as if I\u2019m confused about everything. Reading up on narcissism has lead me to believe that I may not love him at all... that I may be just under his spell. But then I go back and say.., no fucking way. This is my soul mate. after all we\u2019ve been through? How much we love each other? What about all the good? The memories. I\u2019m so torn. \n\nI need help.

I've suspected she has narcissistic tendencies for about six months now, and I'm really unhappy about it. I can't tell if it's real or if I'm projecting my recent realization onto her. The following (small) account happened tonight. I have MANY examples, but this is fresh in my mind and I could use some analysis.\n\nSituation: I urgently realized I needed to buy a pair of pants ASAP. The store closed in 30 mins so I asked her if she could drive me to the store \"right now\".\n\nHer: Can\u2019t you Uber?\n\nMe: There\u2019s no time, can you please just drop me off.\n\nShe reluctantly agrees. Ten mins later near the store:\n\nMe: You can drop me off here.\n\nHer: Do you want me to wait?\n\nMe: Yes, I\u2019ll only be a few minutes. I\u2019d prefer that.\n\nHer: *Do you remember the time you made me walk home from the train station*?\n\n(Here's where it all changed. This was fictitious situation. It was far more complex than that and we both know it. We\u2019ve been over it several times and I did not \"make her\" walk home from the train station).\n\nThis triggered me and made me quite upset.\n\nMe: Is this a joke?\n\nHer: I\u2019m just saying!\n\nI got out of the car. In the store she text me \u201cI parked\u201d.\nI replied: Its fine, go home I\u2019ll Uber.\nShe texts that she\u2019ll wait.\n\nI buy my pants and text her I\u2019m walking. I see her car and get in.\n\nI explained that I was upset that she brought up the \u201cwalking home from the train station thing\u201d.\n\nShe tells me I should be more appreciative that she drove me and dropped me off. \n\nI replied that I was appreciative, but I was upset about the train station thing. What did she mean and why did she say it?\n\nAt this point she\u2019s - what I call - \u201clost\u201d. She\u2019s deep inside a moody hole where nothing I say or do can get her out of it. I try to tell her I love her. She tells me to go away. She tells me to leaver her alone. That she\u2019s tired and can\u2019t talk. This is a *very* common situation.\n\nShe wants me to apologize and show her appreciation. I'm trapped in not really knowing what's going on.\n\n**EDIT** What happened at the train station was that about six months ago, I was working from home and she took the train home from work. It\u2019s a ten minute walk. She called me to pick her up, but I missed her call as I was with a client but called her back while she was about half way home. I offered to come get her and she said it was pointless as she was almost home. I said ok and that was that. Until... until we had a fight that night because I \u201cmade her\u201d walk home from the train station. I stood my ground and never apologized. This was before I started to suspect N.

{"post_id": "al9u5m", "created_utc": 1548829000, "title": "Pieces of the past coming back", "author": "Medi_Kate", "self_text": "*Long Post; Story; Life Lesson*\n\n\nToday I realized that I have A LOT to work on before I even think about talking to/seeing/dating or even hanging out with someone who may have potential of being a partner in my life. OBVIOUSLY it's a bit too soon for me to even consider (a little over a month from breaking up with my nex &amp; 29 days NC), though it's natural to want or feel the need to be with someone, especially going through withdrawal from a toxic/narcisstic abusive relationship that you built such a codependent bond with.. But when I was randomly asked out today for a drink by this guy who I used to talk to before me &amp; my nex were together, I panicked. \n\nHere's the backstory.. \n\nMy &amp; this guy met my freshman year of college. We had this acting class together &amp; ended up being assigned as partners for our final skit performance which was The Story of Hope from Almost Maine. Ever since that time we were pretty close. We talked &amp; hung out a few times throughout our college years &amp; were platonic. After 4 years of being friends, we ended up hooking up. Neither of us planned it &amp; it was mutually exclusive, however, I did start to grow some feels for him but I wasn't getting the same vibe from him so we kind of fell off after that. Soon afterwards I started dating my nex &amp; I stopped talking to that guy completely (mainly because I was in a relationship but also because I knew my nex did not like me talking/being friends with guys). \n\n The idea of this guy asking me out for a drink seemed harmless, friendly, &amp; just a good time to catch up since things were kinda left in the air the last time we talked. However, my mind &amp; thoughts began racing just thinking about the history we had together, how we hooked up in the past, &amp; I grew feelings for him but felt nothing emotionally sparking.\n\nI then started to think about how I had told my nex about this guy when we were together because he pretty much gaslighted me into telling him about guys I hooked up with before him, even when I told him I wasn't comfortable talking to him about my past relationships because he had a tendency of using certain things as a weapon during the times he devalued me. I ended up opening up about this guy to him due to feeling bad about not being completely honest &amp; his response was \"Yeah guys like that do not care about you. You shouldn't put yourself out there like that because it makes you look easy. I can't believe you did that.\"  (As if he didn't hook up with someone (or multiples) before we were together). He then made me promise him that I would delete every guy off of my social media (snapchat in particular) no matter if we talked or not.  So I kept my promise &amp; I deleted every guy from my SM out of respect to him &amp; our relationship. He would still use the fact that I told him that me &amp; this guy hooked up (before we were together) as a comparison of the kind of guys that I could have in my life who \"use me for sex &amp; don't care about me\" compared to him. It got pretty abusive in the sense that my nex constantly belittled me for my past, for which he was not a part of, &amp; made me feel terrible about the choices I made. He excused the abuse that he was putting me through for \"better than using me for sex\" or \"treating me like garbage\" or \"beating the shit out of me\" (which that comparison is debatable). Yet the type of things he put me through were just as bad, if not even more mentally &amp; emotionally traumatizing. \n\nI also felt guilty for even considering going out with someone.. Guilty because I still feel so strongly about my nex, yet at the same time I know the him I loved was not real.\n\nAll of this was going through my mind being asked out for a drink at Taco Tuesday..This is how I know i'm not ready.  The anxiety I felt about all this was a true physiological response that I felt like I had no control of.  With the help of calling my therapist I was able to analyze why I was feeling the way that I was...\n\nMaybe it was because this guy was a part of my past, a past me that is no longer existent, a past me that is not who I am now after the abuse. He's a good guy &amp; neither of us went into hooking up to develop feelings. It just happened. I let my Nex know that &amp; he used it against me as a way of control throughout our relationship. These thoughts were a huge trigger for my anxiety &amp; I didn't want to make a premature decision that would put me in a bad spot. I've been trying my hardest to continue on this healing journey &amp; I can't let anything set me back.\n\nI felt bad that I had to let the guy know that it wasn't a good time for me though I appreciated the offer, but he was very understanding. This truly meant a lot. \n\nMy therapist said something that really stuck with me, she said, \"You have to stop worrying about how other people feel sometimes. You're such a giving person &amp; have a big heart. People will take advantage of that. It's about time that you listen to what's best for you.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have been with my bf 3 years and I think hes a narcissist. However I am not 100% sure and theres tons of factors like I met him when my daughter was 3 months old and hes been in her life ever since when her dad has been mostly in and out of jail. Anyway when we first met we fucked every day sometimes more than once. That started slacking by year 2 and he admitted to me he had no desire. Then we had my son which he is the father and I knew things were tense but he had recently bought me a ring not that either of us want to get married at this point but 2 days after my son was born I had a bad feeling and i checked his phone. To find pof, ok cupid, etc and I told him it was over he begged and pleaded. He said it was to stroke his ego, he gained weight and was insecure, etc and i believed him and still we weren't having sex. He admitted to low testosterone and his dr started giving him testosterone shots. I saw his lab work and it was extremely low. I gave him time all while being sexually frustrated. Now his testosterone is normal but its like i have to beg for sex and i may get it every 3 weeks if im lucky. Its ridiculous. The reason I think hes holding it over my head is because now his testosterone is normal but he watches porn, talks to hookers, all kinds of shit.

Ive just started seeing things that he does to hurt me on purpose, how hes been telling me for 3 years hes going to work on caring about my feelings, etc. He pays for everything and is extremely generous or he was but money been really tight because of shit hes done.

At the beginning, he would gush about how well behaved, gorgeous, and wise my dog seemed. He even met her after about 2 months and appeared to be smitten. Then after the 4.5 marker of when things went sour, he started making negative comments on my dog too. She's not pure. She's not friendly. She's a bitch and her butthole is too dark. I would brush it off but deep down, I was really hurt. How petty and awful do you have to be to turn on my dog too?!

I went to therapy very early on in our relationship. Even before that, somehow, I can\u2019t remember, I came across narcissism and emotional abuse. It fit. Everyone I spoke  To said the same. My therapist even thought he was a psychopath. \n\nI didn\u2019t have that \u201comg; this explains it\u201d after the fact. I knew. Or, I suppose more accurately; I strongly suspected he was a narc. All the while I was talking to him \n\nAll the signs were there from the little I could gather from this long distance relationship. \n\nSo what did I do? Pack my bags and leave?\n\nNo. I confronted him with everything I suspected was going on from the way I felt through his disjointed actions and words and constant emotional withholding. I filled in the gaps in my head and ran to him in tears, claiming I knew what was up and at the same time just begging that he would see it rather than realising that I even thought these things meant I should leave. Because even if he wasn\u2019t doing those things, this was a new kind of hell every day. \n\nOf course, I wanted to deny it. I wanted desperately to believe everyone else was wrong. But we just never got to that good point. It just got worse and worse and worse. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I did it. Here I was, not trusting a single word that came from his mouth, questioning every move because I knew deep down that he was lying and manipulating me and cheating. Here I was in this constant emotional hell and all I would do would be to bring it out on him. The good times were barely existent by this point. \n\nI can\u2019t hide under the ignorance of not knowing. He accused me of just enjoying making him feel bad but no, I felt awful. He kept asking why I stayed when all I did was complain. Why was I running to him with these accusations and suspicions? He was right \u201ceither trust me or leave\u201d\n\nEg. When I started to realise he was trying to distance himself to get me to break up with him. Or when he outright lied to me about contacting some girl and I just KNEW there was something off about their interactions. I of course never had definitive proof, but there was enough to suspect, and I told him so. Why? He did not like that. \n\nBecause I still feel anxious about these things. I still obsess and ruminate and kick myself in the foot and wonder what was really going on. Even though we aren\u2019t talking. \n\nBecause maybe he was right - all I did was complain about stuff and what he did and how he treated me. I hate confrontation but somehow I just kept doing it. And it always escalated. And so it spiralled downwards and downwards until the only way out was official discard or me-being-silent discard. Because i was always anxious. I did always ruminate over everything. I did over think. So what the hell was I doing trying so desperately to keep him around?\n\nI just make no sense to myself. I guess i was hoping he may say something to make it all okay again. But of course he never did. And why didn\u2019t I learn? It always just turned around onto me feeling awful and crying and him threatening to or actually discarding. \n\nHe was right - why DID I keep complaining about him to him? When I didn\u2019t trust him and it was just torture what the hell was I doing?

He lent me his jacket at marching band practice when it was cold. We texted each other a lot. It started as a typical relationship a 15-year-old would be in. Nothing too serious. \n\nBut very quickly, he started lying. He said that his mother was in the hospital with cancer and she wasn't doing well. I felt for him. He said that he was basically alone since his birth father walked out of his life before he could even remember and his step-father abused and neglected him. I'd like to state here that all of this was a lie. \n\nAs time went on, his mother got worse. She was too sick for surgeries and remained in the hospital. His older sister lived out of town (this much is true) and would only come by if their mother was having bad days. At one point, he told me that she was planning on taking him out of our high school and enrolling him in a school near her so they could live together. \n\nHis step-father, he told me, got more and more abusive. He told me how violent things would get. Once, he found a stray kitten (I'm not even sure if this cat even existed) that he had to hide from his step-father. Allegedly, this kitten was thrown out of the house when his step-father found out. Being an emotional 15-year-old with cats of my own, my heart broke at this. My then-boyfriend implied that there was no way that cat could survive on his own. \n\nEventually, his mom \"died.\" We were having relationship trouble at the time, and I desperately wanted to break up with him. But I couldn't because it didn't feel right. What kind of monster would break up with someone right after their mom died? \n\nOther things he did to me while we dated included: telling me my thighs were \"too big\", pretending to break up with me as a prank, telling me that my problems weren't as bad as his and therefore I had no reason to complain, and try to make me feel less smart than what I really was. \n\nWe did end up breaking up soon after, but we remained close friends. He always seemed to be struggling with depression and would sometimes tell me that he wanted to kill himself. He even went so far as to send me a suicide letter over text which lead to me being on the phone with him until early morning and only getting a few hours of sleep for my driving lesson the next day (which he knew about). I was stressed out beyond belief as his friend, but I always felt the need to stay loyal as others were turning his back on him right after his mother \"died.\"\n\nIt turns out that other people were suspecting that he was lying long before I ever knew. At the time, a lot of our friends' mothers were passing away or had passed away years before--which adds a whole other level of sickness to this. He was apparently tying together details from others' stories to make my own. I was oblivious to it the entire time. He also apparently had a bad history of lying about serious stuff like this from before I knew him and no one ever told me. \n\nAnways, it was a big deal when we found out that his mom was still alive. I was heartbroken. A couple years later, I tried being his friend again because people pushed me to forgive him. It didn't last long as he hadn't changed as a person, kept looking for sympathy, and made all of my problems about him (this was when my grandfather was actually dying). I finally cut him off when I went away for college. \n\nBut I still think about this a lot, and I just recently came to terms with this being considered emotional abuse (at least, I think it counts as abuse). What I struggle with right now is that I have a hard time believing people (because I've learned that people lie a lot more than I once thought) and I see manipulative behavior everywhere. I recently made a big decision at school because a certain group of people I always hang out with have been feeling a bit manipulative, and I couldn't handle feeling like other people have that same desire to control me. \n\nI still think about this guy a lot. I don't know what he's doing anymore. I've blocked him on social media for my own safety, but I still wonder if he's hurting anyone else. Thankfully, his next girlfriend was a lot stronger than me and she broke up with him at the first hint of bullshit. \n\nI think what hurts the most at this point is that after five years, people still struggle to show me sympathy. And I get that it's hard to take in, but I've only told my closest friends at college. But my parents and sister still struggle to understand how harmful this relationship was to me. I think that since it wasn't physical abuse, people are more likely to think that I've recovered from it or wasn't that hurt in the first place. ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

So, for a little background I was briefly seeing a girl last year and she managed to get a hold on me pretty quickly. She wasn't long out of a 10 year relationship in which her ex left her for someone else, which probably should have been my first red flag... She played the sympathy card like a fiddle and reeled me in with the tears and stories of how she was a good person who had just been mistreated. For the first few weeks she was very positive towards me, telling me how I'm one in a million and whatnot, only for the dynamic to change a few short weeks later. Gradually the positivity was totally phased out and I was being used as an emotional crutch.\n\nShe would make plans to meet for drinks and then flake last minute... I was always disappointed when it happened but bit my tongue because I didn't want to lose her... and when I finally mustered the courage to bring it up I was treated to some class A gaslighting in which she would say that she was always clear about not being ready to go \"all-in\"!! Firstly, she hadn't been... and secondly I don't think expecting someone to honour a date that THEY suggested is quite the same as going \"all in\".\n\nAnyway, I decided to put some distance between us and just phase out contact. I knew a confrontation wouldn't yield any results so I just created distance... she didn't like this at all. Kept finding excuses to get in touch every few days and strike up useless inane conversations. These ranged from rants about how her friends had been letting her down to just nonsense memes and things like that. I was matter of fact in my replies and eventually the messages stopped coming.\n\nI went away on holidays for new year and posted a few pics on instagram and just a few days later she was in touch and was right back to lovebombing, telling me how jealous she was of my holiday but that I really deserved it and she was happy for me. Then to my surprise she gave a very convincing speech about how she had seen the light at the end of the tunnel after the awful year previous and that she was ready to start anew. So she invited me for a drink. I was curious (and admittedly excited that maybe something good might be on the horizon). I booked the day off work for the day after our proposed date so that we could really cut loose. Told her I had booked the day off and she said \"great. Looking forward to it.\" Then she literally made no contact from that moment until 8pm on the evening of the proposed date when she messaged saying \"did you forget about tonight? Haha\" I obviously hadn't. But as a matter of principle I refused to make the next move after telling her that I booked the day off for the date. I dont think I could have given a more clear cut sign of my commitment to the date than that. Anyway I told her of course I hadnt but when I didnt hear from her I just assumed she had lost interest. She acted surprised and said she thought the same thing about me... I said \"well at least we're on the same page now... and its still early if you still want to meet up\". Then she started with all this \"oh I think Im coming down with a cold. I feel terrible since you've booked the day off.\" this was all just starting to feel like the same old, same old. Truthfully I think she never had any intention of following through with the date. She said \"lets reschedule\" and I said fine. She got in touch today looking for another inane text chat and I decided to ask if she wanted to meet up this weekend. She replied saying that she could meet for lunch or a coffee but that she wouldnt be free in the evenings. Now, to me a lunchtime meeting or a coffee is a far cry from her original suggestion of meeting for drinks some evening. I asked her does that mean drinks are off the table? She replied saying \"why are you asking that? Ha\" I explained that I was into this and I just wanted to make sure that we were on the same page. No reply. But she'll definitely be in touch again down the line... and probably wont even acknowledge our chat today.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I dealing with a textbook covert narc here? There's been a lot of red flags over the months and this latest fiasco just seems like another attempt to keep me within arms reach.

It wasn't physical and mostly was him leaving semen on my stuff or masturbating in my presence, watching me change or watching porn in my presence. My father also sort of crossed some sexual boundaries but never really touched me sexually I guess? But one thing he would force me to do with my brother is hug and kiss him in front of him. Also throughout the years, even today, all of my family and relatives tell me over and over again what a loving brother I have. He loves me so much. He thinks about me all the time. He protects me and watches over me all the time. But I wonder, is this normal? To have your family tell you this again and again and again and again for years? I know it's common to have parents say 'you should be more like your sibling'  in abusive dynamics, but I've never read about being told over the years how well your brother loves you? So I can't help but wonder, is there a chance these people, in some unconscious level, are aware something not-normal happened. so they feel the need to repeat for years how everything is not ok but instead great? I think mostly I feel bad is having to hear multiple people tell me what a great brother I have and how much he loves me, when in truth? He's not. He doesn't see me as a person and even in present he acts toxic, even tho the sexual abuse stopped (since he moved out). Idk. I feel like I wanna scream at everyone and tell them exactly the kind of person he is but I don't have the courage yet since I live with my mother and rely on financial support from mother &amp; father..

Looking back, it was very lucky for me that we lived in different states and never met up. We have talked every day for a little over 2 years now. The other day we got into a disagreement where it could be seen as me rejecting him (I didn\u2019t want to participate in sexting). He lashed out and revealed that he had a gf for 3 months and was only talking to me because I was charity to him. He used similar lines about her that he told me in the beginning. The fact that \u201cshe brings out the light in me\u201d and \u201cshe knows the real me\u201d. \n\nI was so confused. I always had small feelings that he was narcissistic and even made the mistake of accusing him of being so one time. He always tried to tell me that all men like to \u201chunt\u201d and I\u2019m gullible and dumb for believing any lies men try to tell me. Now I understand deeper that he is the hunter because he was looking for supply. I blamed myself the next day after he revealed this. I also blamed myself and tried to prove myself to be better for him. I completely lost myself in this game he played. \n\nThe amount of mental hoops I had to jump through has me exhausted. I wrote a short cheesy poem (I\u2019m not a writer or have experience in writing).\n\n*Shovel in hand, you went to bury me.*\n\n*But you didn\u2019t realize that when you were carrying me.*\n\n*I would have given you my life if you\u2019d given me the chance.*\n\n*But instead you thought my soul was not worth a second glance.*\n\n*I was one of many and wasn\u2019t aware.*\n\n*You\u2019ve used and abused me and now I\u2019m in despair.*\n\n*As you laid me down in the planned out grave.*\n\n*You didn\u2019t look back to see that I was actually saved.*\n\n*You planted the seed you didn\u2019t know you sewed.*\n\n*And now I will grow and grow and grow.*\n\n*Time will heal me and mend my wounds.*\n\n*Because now I can be me and how unfortunate that you will always be stuck as you.*\n\nI want to grow now. I don\u2019t want to run from myself. Reading about narcissism has made me realize that maybe that therapist I saw several years ago wasn\u2019t just \u201cjumping to conclusions\u201d when she mentioned I am codependent. My friend who says I have \u201cbroken puppy dog syndrome\u201d where I feel the need to help people and sacrifice myself to \u201cfix\u201d them isn\u2019t just her not being kind enough. My childhood and upbringing that had my entire existence catered around my parents wasn\u2019t \u201cjust normal\u201d at all. And most importantly...I do deserve happiness and I am worth it. \n\nIt\u2019s time for me to make a change and use this experience as a positive learning lesson. I will not allow him to destroy me any longer. I\u2019m so grateful I found this sub and hope to make some friends. I\u2019ve been a little isolated but from now on I\u2019m hoping to change.

Not a month later, she was dating this new guy, who I'm gonna call Mike. My mom was pretty nice before the divorce, but after we moved in with Mike she started becoming pretty abusive. She would tell me and my sister about how he was a horrible person and did drugs and slept with too many women, (she told this to a four and a ten year old) and how we were much better off living with her and Mike. She had a ton of mood swings too, like she would wake us up at two in the morning to scream at us about how we were ungrateful, and then make us pancakes for breakfast. \n\nMike was pretty bad too. Like, really bad. By the time my sister was twelve, he was prostituting her out to his friends, then using the money to buy drugs. We would have run away, but I was still pretty young and my sister didn't want to leave without me. When I was eight and finally old enough to run with my sister, my half sister was born and all of a sudden we had to stay to protect her too. The next year, my sister killed herself, and the year after that, my half brother was born. My sister was the only person I truly loved, and I would have killed myself too if not for my little siblings. I protected them like she protected me, but last year I finally had enough. I searched up my dad online and managed to find the business he works for. I called the cops, grabbed my siblings and left. \n\nWe're pretty happy now, living with my dad, but somehow my mom managed to pin all of the abuse on Mike, and she got off.

He was my first real relationship, I was ready to give everything to him. Two months later he broke up with me on my birthday because I was a virgin. That should have been the first sign.\n\nI moved on dated someone else, got rid of the virgin title, we stayed friends. When that relationship ended I was destroyed, he picked up the pieces. We ended up starting a physical relationship and became best friends. Time went on and I started falling in love, he wanted to remain friends, until i met someone else. \n\nAfter a very short relationship with a guy he didnt like he told me he wanted to be with me and I ended things with the other guy. We hooked up and I told him I loved him, as far as I can remember he said he loved me back. This started a very serious relationship.\n\nI think it was good at first, it must have been good right? He was always hitting on other girls, but that was his personality. He was always putting me aside, but that was because he was always busy. The first big sign that something was off was that I didnt want to give him oral (I was extremely scared of men after being sexually assaulted and he knew that) and he threatened and I learned later tried to cheat on me if I didnt do it by a certain date.\n\nIt got worse when we moved in together. We had been planning for a while to move in together. So when his friend told me he had a room and wanted us to move in he jumped on it and I helped get him there. We got furniture from my friend and family to furnish our apartment and I was looking forward to moving out of my parents. The problem was in his eyes I was never asked to move in. I would talk on Facebook about going home to hang out at my place and he would comment that it wasnt my place to got to.\n\nHe would just talk shit about me all the time. Telling me I was loud, I was stupid, I had no friends. His ringtone for me was the imperial march and my name in his phone was annoying bitch. I just let it slide. Then the remarks got worse. It wasnt just him, his friends would come over once a week. I was told to make them dinner and then go back to my room. While I would cook them dinner they would all just say as much shit about me as possible. I would go back to my room and cry myself to sleep.\n\nA while had passed. I had been fighting a disease since before we met and put on about 80 pounds. He stopped looking at me the same. Sex had stopped since I wasnt attractive to him any more and if I tried to initiate he would say I was trying to rape him. I kept telling myself this was love, it was all worth it. He would spend every night with me when I was in the hospital. When I was home he would be out to 6 in the morning saying he was working, he worked retail at a mall that closed at 9. \n\nThen one day I ended up in the hospital for about a week. I knew things weren't great, but he was there every night so it showed that he must love me right?. Well the day I got out he picked me up in my car, with trash bags of everything I owned in the trunk. He wasnt breaking up with me but I needed to live with my parents again. I stayed with him. The next few weeks were hard, I loved him so it would be fine, true love wins. Then I woke up at what i thought was our apartment and my keys were gone. He was dumping me without saying anything on my way to school. He told me I was fat and ugly, he never actually loved me (when I think back he never did say he loved me) and he had been cheating on me.\n\n5 years and nothing meant anything. My first true  love was gone. I spun out of control and turned to alcohol and sex, completely feeling like the shit he made me feel.\n\nIt has been over 3 years, I have been in a relationship for over 2 years with a man who tells me he loves me multiple times a day. We have been living together for over a year and are about to get our own place. We are looking at rings and planning our wedding, I couldn't be happier.\n\nThe problem is I cant let go of my past. I still think about my ex all the time, we stayed friends long after the break up. It took almost two years to try to separate myself from him. I have unfriended and have tried to keep myself out of his life. I feel like I cant escape though. I have constant dreams about him and I constantly feel like I am not good enough. My current boyfriend is the best thing to ever happen to me but I have a hard time trusting the things he says and get nervous when he is gone overnight without me.\n\nHow do I let my past go?

During the break up she owned up to other instances of cheating. However,  there had always been a male friend that I had been suspicious of because she talked about him a lot, triangulated the hell out of him and I, made promises that we could meet which never happened, and then claimed that while he hadn\u2019t known about me until recently (we\u2019d been dating 3.5 years) that they had kissed but never had sex.  I contacted him shortly after the breakup to figure out the nex had gone full on double life and had been dating him as well for 2.5 years. The STD had actually come from some other dude she was banging. While I was just done, the other guy decided to stay with her and work things out even after he and I talked and he knew everything. \n\nThe nex had had a 10 year relationship before we were together and I guess I thought that showed me she was capable of being a mature adult, living with a SO, etc. During the breakup, she shared a story about how she had had a male friend during her long term relationship and that after being friends for two years, she was shocked when one night this friend put the moves on her.  She said she pushed him away (super doubtful-she probably full on cheated) and said \u201cwhy would you kiss me, don\u2019t you know that I am dating X?\u201d And this guy had NO idea that she had a long term boyfriend and was super upset with her. \n\nSo this is where the click happened.

Sorry for my grammar, English isn't my native.**\n\nMy father sexually abused me, started when I was around 2 years old (maybe earlier), busted when I was around 4. Mom fought for me, raised me alone. My father tried to hit us with his car (specially mom) several times, for almost 10 years. I spent weekends at my ngrandmom.\n\nMom is narcistic. In my childhood she and her mother beated me, I had to kneel face to the wall-my skin on my knees looks and feels awful, I shame them, never wear short skirt. I get cold showers from her (once I almost choked)-after that, never get cold shower again. Yes, cold showers, because I can't eat. The smart docs said: anorexia. I was 4, I don't gave a shit on my look. I just cannot eat from the mental/soul pain, the terror. I prayed to God (because Ngranny said I have to) to please, please, don't wake me up at the morning. When I woke up I cried. This is how I became an atheist. Now I now, the non-eating was a self-destructive mechanism from my brain, because I can't hold the pain. I started eat normally around age of 8-9. The mental terror continued, even to this day. My Ngranny died 1 year ago, still haunts me all the memories. My father- I have no idea, I think he's still living, I get his adress, maybe I'll visit him once. Or just stand in front of his house. I want to ask him why. I want to hear from his mouth what he did. I have a huge family on his side: cousins, godmother, etc. They seem on facebook, a big, loving family, sisters, brothers. I want them. I miss them so fuckin much, but I cant take the contact 'till my father living. I fear him so badly. At least, he's old, around age of 70, so maybe\u2026 Until then, I stalking them on facebook. We have so much in common, in our look, in our temper-as I read, in our taste in everything, from music to politics, everything. Things what I never shared with mom or grandmom, and they said how fuckin weird I am. Mom still saying.\n\nUntil then, I still living with my nmom. She verbally abuse me almost every day. She blackmailed me with her suicide. A lot. When I leave the room, she talking fake shits about me behind my back-well, not so behind, I know it. Even heard last night, when she talked shit about me to a random plumber in our loft. I living with her, because I have agoraphobia, panic disorder and PTSD. Sometime feeling better, mostly hardly can go to the corner of the street and back, so I don't have job or an own apartment.\n\nI grew up on what she said, and saying ALWAYS 'till this very days: I cannot be loved. I'm cold, lazy, filthy, I have too many problems. No man will ever love me or staying with me for a long time, because they just wouldn't can. If I'll find a man who staying with me, she will make a statue from him and covering in gold, and chaining him down so he can't run away, because he'll be the only one. She says, I wouldn't be a good mother. Better if I never have child(ren). When I was small, she said as a bonus thing that I'm too skinny, my neck looks like as a gander's neck, and so on. I listen these thing every week, sometimes twice/week. And slowly she broke me, and I believe that I'm a terrible person, no one will ever love me.\n\nI'm 27, 28 will in March. I'm virgin, never even kissed.\n\nBut still: nowadays start to believe maybe she isn't right, maybe I.. I deserve love. I have a looooot of bad habits, but I deserve a loving, caring partner. And I deserve a family. Maybe that one from my father side, and maybe an own family too. But still, I'm too scared to date. To give someone a chance to love me. I had a male bff, our relationship ends, because he fell in love with me. I can't dealing with the situation. So how could I trust a random guy who says love me, when my flesh-and blood relatives did the same and lied, and hurting me so bad? How can I date? I'll just cannot believe that if a guy would say he love me. Because thats impossible, mommy teached me right? So he would lie just to hurt me, even rape or beat me. But I cannot put my pieces together back if I broke again, so I just don't take risk. And die alone, after a long, sufferfull life with my nmom.\n\nYesterday I downloaded Tinder. I have to believe that we deserve love, we are loveable, and maybe we will be happy and healthy one day. Its just so damn hard. But we have to believe in that. I'll not date for a long time as I feel, just.. talking, friending online. Maybe... I always waited for a white knight to rescue me, then I realized I have to be my white knight. I was for a time, but now, I'm just too weak. And coward. Even realized in my childhood that I'll never have a boyfriend, or anyone who love and caring me. And seems, I was a prophet. Still cannot believe this 100%ly.\n\nBut still. I'm a good, nice and beautiful person. As you are, who reading this. As we all are who suffered through ourselves these shits, and still here, not in the graveyard or a mental hospital.\n\nI don't really know why I write this essay, just...

I don't honestly know if I need advice or just a place to vent. But any advice is appreciated. \nMy Nex and i had a fling 2.5 years ago, I ended up pregnant. And because of it I have a wonderfully amazing little girl. \nHe has always been a narc. He also has PTSD and a drinking problem, if that makes a difference.  I sought therapy after a year and a half of having to deal with him being in my life and driving me insane until I finally realized coparenting with him was turning me into someone I'm not. I've never been the girl to crawl in her shell and tuck her legs and run from any situation, but thats where I found myself in june. I went gray rock for awhile. \nThen around our daughter's birthday he was a different person. He was the person I met all over again. Fantastically charming, fun to be around. I actually thought maybe things were alright and he had gotten help for his other issues so life might be normal for once. I didn't realize at the time that's exactly how gaslighting works. \nIt all came to a head in October. He has a history of DV. I knew it was coming and just a matter of when,not if. He hit me. While i was holding our baby. Because he was too drunk to leave with her and I wouldn't let her go. I did everything I was supposed to. I walked away, got an order of protection, went to a lawyer. We set everything up. He got our custody hearing cancelled. We made a proposal for him to have partial custody if he would only seek out treatment, that wasn't good enough, he would rather see me in court. \nFast forward to today, he hasn't seen our baby since he hit me. He's filed against me for sole custody of my baby. With me paying his attorney's fees and child support with minimal visitation. I know I've done everything I was supposed to, I protected my daughter, I got away and got help. But I cant shake the feeling of impending doom that somehow, someway he will win and he will take my baby and disappear with her. I'm terrified, I don't know what else to do. I am not the person to just lay down and die, and yet I'm worried my only option is to take whatever offer he dangles on a fish hook for me so I don't lose her altogether. \n\nFor those of you who have been there before how did you handle it?

UWU\n\nSo... I kinda have wanted to talk about this to anybody, but I havent gotten a shrink yet. Been some issues finding one, and everything has been hell the last years. \nThis is about last summer. \nMy sister tried killing me. \nShe took a grip around my throat, and tried to choke me. \n\nThe thing is, my sister has always hated me. Always done things to make me feel worthless, and les. She wanted my gifts. She destroyed my toys. Normal sister stuff right? When I was 7 she tried to kill me with an axe. She started up rumors about me and ensured I was bullied the whole elementary, and also during high school. She would pretend I hit her and cry, despite never having touched her. She would hit me and cry I hit her. And she called me a devil and a monster. She always hated me. \nIn our teens she almost got me raped, sending me to some dude that offered her drugs in a cab. I rang on the door of the neighbour, so at least nothing came of that. I still consider her highly, even though she attacked me and bullied me all the time. Stuff she did almost drove me to suicide along with the rest of my shitty life experiences. My family, the school, nothing about it has been right. \nI accepted it quite a long time, I have always been able to survive. However, it started getting to me after I did some self help work after moving. Shit hit the fan for real when I during my sisters lies believed her as she said I should move back to the city with her. I was left with my abusive family as she went outside XXXX to study, abandoning the promise of living together. I had a real heavy depression. I still didnt go to shrink or doctors that time. Things didnt go so well. The times we meet became more and more violent. She would hit me for no reason and make me cry when talking with me alone, while pretending to be the oh so sweet and caring sister. It was her image to others. I was her stress ball for her rage. I had less and less contact, especially after I had a break down. It gave me amnesia, it wasnt just my sister triggering that, but my father as well. \nMy sister have always had this contempt for me, and I knew it, so I kept a distance. She keeps blaming me for everything, despite me not being around her. She still calls me a devil, and has that evil twisted smile whenever she makes up a story for others about me. \n\"Oh she is shy\" or \"Oh, she is afraid of people\" to explain away why I dont talk (because she ignores me, and doesnt listen, and if others talk to me she gets angry and demand attention).\nAnyways\u2026 the last summer, after lots of issues. She also does drugs. I had a conflict with her, telling her I would be leaving. First it was a \"I will stop you\", and then as I told her about how I would tell our parents about her drug abuse, she got this stare in her eyes and said \"I will kill you\" then grabbed me by the throat and choked. Not sure how long it lasted, as I got away. Luckily as I got out of the room. This happen in a hotell, there was witnesses there. She attacked and bit me and all sorta bullshit.\nAnd as I called for help she started screaming I was trying to kill myself. I didnt attack her, just told her to let me go, I was not gonna stay there with her. I couldnt stop crying as she had been extremely mean the whole night (it was our first time on the city for almost a year apart as I have come to be afraid of her after the last time she started to attack me for no reason). \nThe situation was luckily broken up by other guests at the hotell. There is probably no note in the news either of my country, as it was probably paid away or some shit. I cried all the night to staff, I didnt talk about what she had done, but I told her how mean she was. After, my eyes became blood red, almost completely red. I have had issues, been really broken, and I still get thinking about it. I was broken all up to Christmas. She did not apolegize either, except in front of our mother. Beside that she called me a lier and such. \nI told our parents about her drug abuse on a later date. \n... as I started feeling better, it was just one week of peace this december, and then mom died. \nI have heavy conflicts within myself. I am still to broken to deal with my sister, but my mom wanted us to be friends. Yet she ignores me completely. Of course I blocked her before the funeral, but thats past. She ignores me and doesnt aknowledge me in conversations, except if there is anyone else talking to me. And she will have that look of \"Dont talk to her\" while acting like its \"fine\". I really dont want contact. She has to mature on her own, I must live for my own sake. \nI have been with an emergency shrink a while, its just temporary, so I dont know how it will work out mentally. \nI feel like I should honor my mothers wishes, but it doesnt seem like she wanna try at all. \nI am afraid. I feel like she is going to kill me. \nShe is gonna find the time. I dont feel safe at all. \nI am afraid. I dont openly admit it even to the emergency shrink.\nOften I show a stone face, but I am in true turmoil. I am afraid.\nHow am I suppose to deal with this? I should keep away until she figures out her own issues. I feel nauseous of the though of being close to someone who wants me to die. Its horrible. \nI cant forget it. I though I knew, like before winter I was like \"I am gonna live for myself\" that was when I finally like was able to start doing stuff again, but then... and now I feel unsure again. \n\nAnyone else been through anything similar? Its probably not normal having a sister try to kill you and hating you so intens for no reason. I was early taller than my sister, and I was blond and had blue eyes. She cut my hair of when I was a kid because she was jealous of me. She always say I am such a horrible person. \nI just dont know how to deal with her in my current state. \nI dont think I should keep in contact any more. She never contacted me anyways. I was always the one doing the calling. \n:( \nI dont know what to do :( \n", "subreddit": "abuse"}

What types of things might he say or do? \n\nI've posted before so I won't repeat all the details. Briefly I met a guy who love bombed me with adoration and then disappeared and reappeared and I took him back.  The relationship moved real quick even intimacy before really dating for various reasons...partly a dumb mistake on my part, schedule differences etc. He said things like his end game with \nme was marriage and a family. Talked about how much time he wanted to spend with me. He initiated the relationship and I agreed. All lies. I found out he has a girlfriend who is 10years younger than me and him. I believe he was starting to pursue her while still love bombing me.\n\nThe current state of our relationship is him making multiple attempts to booty call me. He's continuing to complain that I'm ignoring him. But also trying to sweet talk me. I have been deflecting his attempts. \n\nWe're going to be working together again so I'd been deflecting him in a polite way as to minimize any anger on his end.\n\nI've gotten to the point where I feel I need to call him out on trying to make me a booty call. Also, officially end this weird relationship. Yes, I fell for it in the beginning as I didn't see it as a booty call at first but no more. I say officially end it because the nature of our relationship is him trying his luck with me every so many days...disappear and try again. Trying to sweet talk me. \n\nIs this a safe statement to make.\nIf he tries again I plan to tell him that we're not on the same page and want two different things. And, that we probably need to move forward from each other. I don't plan to mention I know about the girlfriend. \n\nI'm going to try to be as nice as possible or if I can make him feel he's doing the dumping. I just want to be as prepared as I can. I'm nervous because quite a few people say he might react poorly. But again if I am nice about it perhaps that will help his ego and to feel like he's in control. \n\nYes.

We met online and I remember him asking me if I had any. I said no and didn\u2019t think much of it. \n\nBut then when we got closer, his exes looked like that - that kinda gothy edgy look. And one of them, he still contacted, he still wasn\u2019t over, she was a MAJOR issue in our relationship because even though she was \u201ca sociopath\u201d who cheated on him, he couldn\u2019t seem to let go and they were forever in contact. \n\nAnd he told me she was the only girl to really capture his feelings. He was really into her. \n\nAnd she looked so different to me. I could not have been more different to them. \n\nHe continued to like these pages. And then when he stopped being sexual or intimate with me (my fault, for being a dramatic complaining bitch that turned off his libido) he would still like his exes pics. And watch porn. \n\nAnd then I started to realise how, he\u2019d tell me how hot it would be if I got tattoos. I started to become hyper aware of every girl I saw that looked like \u201chis type\u201d. Even now, if I see that kind of girl, I get a sinking feeling in my stomach. \n\nI never felt like this before. I was me. I wasn\u2019t totally happy about my looks sure, but I\u2019d never compare myself to other people. I\u2019d never feel the need to be jealous of other girls. \n\nBut it was just so clear I wasn\u2019t his type. And I feel like an awful person feeling this way because it isn\u2019t his fault. But when it got to the discarding and the lack of sexual connection I can\u2019t help but feel I wasn\u2019t his type.

He even said I turned him off with the way I was acting. \n\nI remember sending him pictures of me and he didn\u2019t even respond that he liked them. Because i was such a turn off at that point.

I know I shouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t remember ever feeling this insecure. Lile to question my looks and feel ugly just because I don\u2019t look like his ex and the girls he likes looking at.

I  confined in him some personal stories, something I\u2019ve never done before. My mother always told me if I ever told a guy I was dating and it ever got serious he would do the same. I was also embarrassed and my mother always told me to keep our family problems a secret. Most importantly always portray a happy, perfect family. As I grew older I realized as silly as this may sound that I have perhaps been greatly physically abused by my alcoholic father. Who I dearly love so much no matter how abused I was. But after an ugly break up with this guy, I started to question if I ever was really abused. This guy told me that everyone had problems and it wasn\u2019t a big deal. He said he knew people who had it way worse. This is when I realized my mother was right, I will never tell another guy the way I was treated growing up. It\u2019s nearly 5am I cant sleep and I can\u2019t stop crying. I\u2019m so confused! I was born in Mexico and as far back as I can remember my dad always had a drinking problem. He would come home at 5am In the morning extremely intoxicated, would wake my mother up to cook him something to eat. While she cooked he verbally abused her following with physical abuse. I recall one night in particular, he was so mad he throw a steaming hot pan to hit her but it hit me instead. I was only 3 years old. I don\u2019t know how I recall all of this but i do. Another vivid story before we moved to the United States and the abuse continued was an evening where my father was Incredibly intoxicated. My mother begged him not to take me with him to the city but he was a man and was not going to listen to no women. After all she is beneath him! He picks me up and takes me in his truck, he speeds back and forth, next thing I know we completely fip in his truck. We could have both died that night. Shortly after my sister was born and we moved to the United States. My poor mother was beaten so badly so many nights. We once where forced to sleep outside of thier apartment while my mother was covered in blood. She hadn\u2019t washed the covers I vomited on the previous night because i was sick. My mother\u2019s knee hurts pretty often my father was beating her and she hit her knee on the chimney bricks. The abuse was constant, he had no sympathy. Years later my mother was pregnant again, this night he placed his arm over her 8 month belly. She told him it was very uncomfortable, his response was to beat her until her arms, legs and face were purple. My mother started working when I was in elementary school, leaving me to take care of the kids. I was like their mother, changed their dippers, feed them and put them to sleep. There was always verbal abuse when my dad was drunk, I always was belittled and told I was stupid, not worth anything and never amount to anything. When I became a preteen the physical abuse started more intensely then before. I was so depressed all I wanted to do was sleep so I wasn\u2019t abused or wouldn\u2019t think about it. I was constantly dragged from my hair to my bedroom because he simply didn\u2019t want to see me in the living room. Then the door knob would be torn off because he wanted to redrag me out of my room. One night before my 15th birthday, I was woken up with him punching my face. By now I was so used to the constant beatings and verbal abuse. I woke up the next day with a busted lip and half of my face completely purple. Sometime I get so angry at my mother thinking about it. She asked me that morning who had done that to me? My father of course, she called him yelling at him for beating me so badly. That was the only time I felt like my father felt remorse, he gave me $100. I always wonder however, why my mother didn\u2019t try to stop him from hurting me but I guess she couldn\u2019t if she was receiving the same treatment, \n", "subreddit": "abuse"}

We have had a very rocky three year relationship to say the least. He caught me at a vulnerable time in my life, but I was truly happy. He swooped in and charmed his way in and I feel head over heels immediately. Slowly he started picking away at me. Things he didn\u2019t like, things he wanted me to change, who I could talk to (who I couldn\u2019t), putting down my sisters, calling out my male friends. Stupid me, I thought-wow, this man really likes me, he is trying to get the negative out of my life and make me happy. I was a fool. I\u2019d say or do something wrong and he would immediately break up with me. I would be heartbroken. Like look, I\u2019m trying to change for you. I\u2019d beg and plead and make promises until he\u2019d forgive me and take me back. This happened a few times early on, then I stopped begging. I feel like a woman would come along and spark his attention, he\u2019d dump me and date her. When she wasn\u2019t what he wanted, he\u2019d find a way to message me and sneak back in. This happened over and over. Just when I felt like I was getting strong after being dumped, bam! He\u2019d show up again all charming. So what did I do? I sold my house and moved in with him. I know, I know. I so desperatly  wanted to start a new life for my girls and I. I honestly believed that if I changed enough or made him love me enough then, then we could be happy and have a long relationship. He kicked us out after a couple months. Literally, like out on the streets. Thank goodness my sisters were willing to take me in. \n\nI got a new house, started over. Started dating and having fun. I never messaged him and had him blocked or he had me blocked on everything. Well I went back to that town (1 1/2 hours away) because I had a friend date with a guy I was talking to. I went to get my eyebrows down and then headed on my way. I left my phone in the car and proceeded on. The dinner went great and we decided to go get a couple drinks after. He walked me to my car so I could grab my phone, and upon looking at it my heart dropped. There my ex was on the screen sending me a message via fb messenger (he must have unblocked me, my bad for not having him blocked). I wish I never responded, but I did. He asked me if I was following him (apparently he pulled out behind me after my apt). I responded with, \u201cwhat\u201d and I\u2019ll regret that forever. He started talking and I explained to him that I was out with a friend and couldn\u2019t talk. After my friend and I had a couple drinks we both had to go. I walked him to his car and headed to mine. Well guess who was there? Yup. Upon seeing him, all my anger went away and I was so happy again. I mean, he still wanted me! I wasn\u2019t so bad after all! I went home with him that night and the next day it all began again. I had to message every guy I was talking to and tell them we couldn\u2019t talk anymore. I had to give all my account passwords and delete all male friends off any social media.  He did the same, so why should I have a problem with it? Right? Oh my God, the next few months were amazing! He was wonderful. He was traveling to my house to see me all the time (I always drove to see him), he was honestly perfection. Well his mother got diagnosed with terminal cancer and he explained to me he wanted to get married quickly so she could be there. Guess what, he bought me a beautiful ring and I said yes. We were married within a month. The control and jealousy were still there, but the good things he was doing overpowered that. He\u2019d do all the things I love-kayak, hike, go in the woods, breweries to try different beer. It was nice. \n\nI decided to pull my girls from school and move to be with my husband. Obviously things started to get weird right away. I was moving some of my stuff in and some of his was going out. He was angry about me trying to make a comfortable home for my girls. He constantly was on me about everything-where I go, who I talk to, my \u201cslutty\u201d hairstylist friend, my sisters-everything, I had time limits at the store. He didn\u2019t want me to work, but I did and that was hell. Every time he got mad his ring came off and he wanted a divorce. I\u2019d beg and beg and beg. Finally after I had validated him enough, he\u2019d put the ring on and love me. I left my job, and became a slave, doing everything. Raising my girls and taking care of his boys, all while I served him food while he played video games. This is the way I lived my life for almost a year. \n\nThings really started to change. He was watching porn on his phone, sex disappeared (I\u2019m very sexually active), he spent more and more time downstairs playing video games and I just sat in the room alone. He locked his phone, and had secret Twitter and Instagram accounts, when I couldn\u2019t have anything. Playful wrestling was getting a little out of control and the shoving was getting harder. I just kept saying....make it through the holidays. I did. It was tough and he even tried to kick us out before Christmas. But we made it. We planned an amazing vacation for February 2019 and I wanted to make it till then. A vacation would help right? Bring us closer right? Well on January 13, he got a uhaul helped me load all my stuff (and the girls) in black garbage bags. With in 4 hours almost everything I had left was in the truck (besides the stuff he stole from me). \n\nMy daughter got off the bus to me in the driveway with a uhaul. Back to my sisters house we go. I\u2019ve been here now for almost three weeks. I am devastated. I have no money, no home, no job. Nothing. That man took everything I had and then kicked me out. He filed for divorce immediately and I was served last week. We have zero contact with each other, but I hear he is taking someone else with him on our vacation that\u2019s coming. Yup. That is killing me. He is selling my stuff online that he kept. I\u2019m a mess. \n\nI know I could have stayed in the house longer legally, but I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m just so lost right now. I look back and can\u2019t believe what I allowed him to do to me. But there\u2019s nothing I can do, that parts over. How do I find happiness again? My sick brain dreams of him every night and I miss him. But, I\u2019m so angry. So pissed off. How dare he get a home, while my girls and I share a room at my sisters. I wish I was smarter and stronger. How do I move on? How do I start to find myself again after three years of being beat down and picked apart? \n\nI\u2019m sorry this is so long. I appreciate any advice. ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I mean, sure, I'm pretty isolated from family and friends, but *I* chose to do that.........right?

I questioned my version of reality where I felt loved and cared about by her. My reality where she loves me for my quirkiness and not in spite of it. My reality where the truth was that *I* had introduced the two of them after she and I were friends already. I just.....I questioned myself. And that led to me distancing myself from her. I didnt want to overstep, and he obviously felt like I had. I saw that was hurtful to him.....so I stepped back.

We went out drinking and dancing - and the whole time, the wife (who messaged me this morning) was upset because she had been left at home and she suspected that something was going on between her husband and my husband's sister. \n\nThey have only been married for a few months - so at the time this incident occurred, they'd been married less than two months, and here her husband was carrying on with his old girlfriend - at my house, right in front of me. \n\nThe thing is, my narc and I were the only ones at their wedding. N was the best man, and because she didn't have anyone, I was her person, even though I barely knew her. It was a beautiful wedding, but I felt pretty uncomfortable about it because I knew that N's best friend is a player and not really marriage material. But, I rationalized, she's an adult and she must know what she's getting herself into. \n\nAfter we came home from drinking and dancing, everyone was laughing and having a good time. I had already made up my mind to leave and everyone knew that N and I were breaking up, but we were being friendly that night. \n\nThe wife kept calling, wanting to know what was going on and when her husband was coming home. It was about 2 in the morning, her husband was drunk and wanted to stay and hang out with my sister in law. So he was on the phone, totally gaslighting his wife - telling her nothing was going on and she didn't have anything to worry about. \n\nI watched all of this with a sort of detachment because I was already in the state of mind where I knew it was over and I was leaving. \n\nWhen I heard the desperation in the wife's voice (she was on speaker phone), I spoke up and told her husband what I thought about the way he was treating her. \n\nEveryone laughed at me and then got pissed off because I wouldn't go along with the gaslighting and their horrible cruelty towards this woman. \n\nThey kept saying, who is she to you? You barely know her. We're family! We're just having fun and she is freaking out because he's having fun without her. \n\nI was disgusted and went to bed. The best friend and my sister in law slept together that night. \n\nI have wanted to tell her what happened that night ever since. But I keep thinking I should wait until the divorce is final so I don't give my narc anything to use against me. \n\nWhich is why I blocked her. But somehow she managed to message me anyway. She was really nice and just said she's sorry it didn't work out for me and my husband and she thanked me for being there for her wedding. \n\nUgh ... I really want to respond and have her call me so I can tell her that she's not crazy - that she was right to suspect her husband was cheating on her that night and to give her some info that helped me understand what was going on with my relationship with a narcissist - cuz I'm pretty sure her husband is a narcissist too. \n\nSorry - this is long.

He would get on Tinder, and search for other girls while I was sitting on the couch right next to him, and when confronted about it he'd tell me I wasn't \"acting right\", and he was afraid I'd break up with him, so he'd gone on Tinder to I guess shop for someone else. He'd ask me what I wanted to eat for dinner, and when I told him he'd tell me, \"You'll eat whatever I fucking make\" in a joking but malicious manner, he'd be shady about his time in the army and wasn't clear about why he was discharged after only 2-3 years, he'd tell me he was a chef when all he was was a glorified handyman and lunch lady at a summer camp, and worst of all he told me his grandmother died from ALS in order to \"take a break\" and break up with me, because when I was honest with him and said I didn't want to have children, he blew it way out of proportion and lied to me like my opinion was a major affront to him and his desire to have kids. Every time he reacted negatively towards me in this way he let me know that it was all my fault.\n\nTo put the cherry on top, he and I live in the same small town. I'm a native while he's an interloper from elsewhere. I've tried to remove him from my life as best I can, but at the tail end of last year he started dating a girl who received a job offer at the small non-profit I work at (which he knows), so not only has he made my personal life a living hell, but he's infiltrated my work space. Before she even got the job he was adding MY coworkers on Facebook, who had never met the guy. I had to let my superiors know that he's probably not the kind of person you want working with the community if he chooses to volunteer while his current girlfriend works here. I was even afraid he'd tell a lie about me, and it would put my job in jeopardy.\n\nI feel incredibly alone, and unable to do anything about this situation. He constantly shows up at work here. He picks his new girl up and drops her off. He's found a way into my life again, and it's ridiculous. I see him making it so she'll be unable to leave when she finally sees his true colors. He tried to with me. Asked me to move it and pay for groceries when we weren't even officially together yet. Also asked me to get him a job in the business my father owns and runs.

I'm going to bullet point things he's said/done to me to make it easier and I would love to hear if any of your Narcs have done similar things/behavior. \n\n\\-When we first started dating he was constantly saying he's a \"good guy\". He also loved to brag about how many girls are \"into/in love/obsessed with him\" especially the girls from his past. I remember he said once \"So many girls go crazy when they can't be with me, but I don't do anything wrong. I'm a good guy\". \n\n\\-Yes he was my boyfriend, but I never felt like I fully HAD him if that makes sense. My ex was in a band and worked part time as a bartender. There was ALWAYS attention from girls and he loved to talk about it. Whether it was how many groupie girls are obsessed with him to how many girls asked him for his number at work. When I got upset with him talking about this so much he immediately made me feel bad and said \"Well if I wasn't telling you these things then that would be shady. You should be happy I'm being honest with you\". \n\n\\-I was always insecure he would leave me for someone else. ALWAYS. I felt like I had to be on perfect behavior at all times and if I had any doubts, fears, or insecurities about other girls or our relationship he would get irritated and say, \"It's like you want me to cheat on you\", \"You want me to treat you like shit\", \"I'm nothing but good to you\", \"You make me feel like a bad boyfriend\", \"I'm a good guy\", \"You're always the victim\", and my personal favorite...\"I can have whoever I want, but I'm with you\". \n\n\\-He would say I'm a \"bad vibe\" and \"play mind games\" even though he had no evidence or reason behind it when I asked \"How so?\". He'd say \"You just are\".\n\n\\- He never bought me flowers and when I asked him why he said, \"Because you don't seem like the type of girl that wants flowers\"....side note I go to the Farmers Market EVERY Sunday and buy myself a bouquet of sunflowers for my room.\n\n\\-He was allowed to follow his ex's and girls from his past on Instagram and like their posts, but if I did? No way. He'd FLIP. \"You can do whatever you want, I'll just kick you to the curb\". \n\n\\- He would accuse me of cheating or make me feel like I was cheating when I wasn't. He had dreams I would cheat  or \"someone from work\" would get into his head about me cheating, but HE was very vocal about how \"cheater's are scumbags and I wouldn't dare look at myself if I did that\"...lol okay. \n\n\\- He didn't get me anything on my birthday. It took him two hours from us waking up to wish me a happy birthday. I went into the shower and sobbed. He heard me crying, came in, and started screaming at me \"What the fuck did I do now?! You always make me feel like I'm a horrible boyfriend!\". I had to apologize that day. \n\n\\-I maybe got one apology the entire year we were together. The rest of the apologies were from me, begging him not to break up with me. \"If you keep this shit up, I'm dumping you\" (every fight). \n\n\\- His mom caught me crying one day and told me, \"He can have whoever he wants. If you keep being insecure he'll leave you for someone else\". Apple doesn't fall far from the tree. \n\n\\- He never had my back if someone else in his family or friend group was making me feel like shit or putting me down in front of him. NEVER. He'd just say \"I'm overreacting\", \"I'm too sensitive\", \"Ignore it\", \"It's all in your head\", \"They like you, you're the dramatic one\". \n\n\\- He broke up with me out of the blue. He put all of my belongings in TRASH BAGS (we were living together) and was sobbing crying saying \"I love you but I'm so unhappy with myself and this relationship makes me feel like I'm not going anywhere in life and I just need to be alone right now\". Three weeks later he's in a relationship with a 19 year old girl and took her on a family trip I planned and payed for. I then see she's bragging all over social media how \"he left me for her\". He was texting her the last couple weeks we were together and when I asked who she was \"Shes a fan girl who's obsessed with me but she has a boyfriend you have nothing to worry about\".  \n\nI haven't talked or heard from him in 5 months which has helped me take off my rose colored glasses and see his actions for what they really were. I spent a lot of time blaming myself and trying to think what I did to make him leave me and jump into another relationship so quickly. Unfortunately, I have this bad mindset that I still believe he's a \"good guy\" because our whole relationship seemed to be him trying to prove to me (or himself) that he was a good guy and I believed him. Then I hear how his new girlfriend posts everyday on social media how happy and in love they are and I can't help but think, maybe he's changed? Maybe he's treating her with the respect, worth, and value I was craving for him our entire relationship? \n\nThanks for reading! I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences.

I\u2019ve grown into adulthood relatively well acclimated but my brother was not so equipped to cope due to some anti-social personality traits i can only presume. I believe he suffers from a host of undiagnosed mental disorders as a result. My parents have been unhappily married for 25 years and have threatened to divorce without follow through on numerous occasions. They have always struggled to get on the same page about whether to treat my brother as a mentally ill kid or a lazy and ungrateful adult. He still lives with my parents while taking one final course online to earn his bachelor\u2019s degree after 6 years of attempting. My parents gave him one last chance at completing the coursework and then needs to move on and get a job with or without the degree because they won\u2019t pay for it anymore. After semester end a couple weeks ago, he says his professor has marked his course attempt as incomplete and is giving him time to turn in missing or incomplete assignments. He won\u2019t show an email from his professor or proof of this at all and screams that my parents are being dramatic when asked when he will be rewarded his degree. He often says he wants to die, phrased in various ways, and has claimed this for years. He has no work experience, refuses to get a job (because social interaction is scary to him plus he says the job won\u2019t make him enough money), no people skills (thinks he is superior to people and work, but also complains he is very bored and lonely living in the suburbs), and only sits at home on the couch watching the news. All he wants to talk about is politics but rambles and gets angry, sometimes violent, when trying to express his views. My mother often asks me for advice on dealing with him but my parents are divisive (talking about each other behind their backs with my brother). My father has threatened to kick him out for years but never has. My brother sees no consequences to his bad behavior (he got kicked off a sports team in high school and soon after they bought him a car). \n\nMy mother, and sometimes my father, have tried numerous times to force my brother to see a psychologist but he was always resistant. Now he waivers on the idea of therapy. He has never been diagnosed and therefore has never been prescribed drugs for mental illness. He has a history of addiction to Xanax but asked for help from my father to end the use. He complains of mental scars caused by my parents. \n\nMy dad is the ultimate enabler- gives my brother weed, ignores his outbursts and supports profane attacks on my mother. My mother is strictly against marijuana and began treating my brother like an addict in middle school when she learned of his use, at-home drug testing him regularly, openly blaming my father, and giving him a very early curfew through high school, treating my brother as though nothing he did was right or good enough. My brother has expressed recently that actions like that have scarred him. \n\nThe fate of my parents is unknown, but I feel a big pull to help my brother become a functioning adult. He hasn\u2019t shown interest in being my friend since we were about 5, and when i try to communicate with him it can often end with verbal or sometimes physical abuse. It hurts me, but I can only imagine all the yelling he must have endured during those first 4 years of his life. \nGetting him into voluntary therapy is probably the answer?

My symptoms have progressively gotten severely worse, and I am literally at the point where once I get a text, I am in full panic mode. I can barely get out of bed to go to work and I am in a full on panic everyday. It doesn't help that every single decision that needs to be made just ends in an argument.\n\nYou guys, I have no idea how to deal with this at all. I feel like I am stepping into a new realm of depression and anxiety I've never experienced before. I can hardly function and it terrifies me. I have an appt with a therapist next week and my BF really wants me to get medication for my anxiety because smoking weed isn't helping anymore and I cry all the time and am in a constant panic.\n\nDoes anyone else have to deal with a situation like this where you have no choice but to deal with the person who caused so much pain and sorrow in your life on a \"multiple times a week\" basis. I don't know how I can continue doing this. Each court date and each argument just adds more weight what I already have on my shoulders.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We met up at a co-working space in Cambodia last Spring and he seemed incredibly kind and genuine. He would message me every day, we would go on walks, and then once I left to go to another place we still kept in contact. He told me at the time he hadn't been in a relationship in 5 years and things just never worked out with other women. I assumed that was because he was a shy, nerdy programmer. \n\nHaving come out of a different abusive situation previously I felt he would be a good person to date. He was never sexually suggestive (at first), was kind, intelligent, but a little braggy of his talents and aspirations. We continued to message each other for 4 months before I decided I really wanted to spend time with him again. He would write me letters, send me gifts, etc. I met up with him in India and my first day there I had a weird feeling in my stomach about his behavior. He seemed totally different than the guy I had met months before. I remember being taken aback when he called a tuk tuk driver a dummy for not knowing how to get to our hotel. My first week there I told him about how I needed to learn boundaries and was working on that due to a previous relationship and he said \"I will break them\". I shrugged it off and thought it was a joke (turned out it wasn't). He mentioned that men were biologically meant to sleep with multiple people and it was hard for them to stay with one person, but if the sex was interesting then they were less likely to cheat. That comment also threw me off as he seemed very collected when I first met him and not that way at all. He would spend some time looking at other women on Facebook, at first he would do it in front of me, but as soon as I said it made me feel uncomfortable he started hiding it.\n\nI didn't listen to my initial gut feeling telling me to run away. I stayed for almost 6 more months travelling with him. During most of the trip I felt I couldn't trust him, but couldn't quite figure out why. A few months later I found out that when he was messaging me and sending me letters he was actually sleeping with someone else (his claims it wasn't his GF, but I know it was). He said he had \"broke it off\" with her and that I could trust him. I secretly started to become neurotic and would be so obsessed with the other women in his life. I would notice, but not tell him, that I could still see him engaging with his other fling on social media (liking her posts and whatnot). He never made an effort not to do that. Meanwhile he was telling me he wanted me to meet his mom, add his family on social media, telling me he wanted to get married, asking me how many kids we wanted to have. I honestly fell so hard for him from the very beginning and it sounded like a dream to me. \n\nThe lovebombing ended after the first two months, then slowly he started being negative. \"you're basic\" \"you're all over the place\" \"you're annoying\" \"you're toxic\" \"you're rude to people\" \"you act like a douche bag, so I will treat you like one\". My favorite was when he called me \"loose\" for going on a date two months before even meeting him; he made me cry in front of people that day and never apologized (until our final breakup call two days ago). He would mention his ex-girlfriends all the time, his Tinder dates from around the world, etc. I always felt uncomfortable and insecure. \n\nI would hear him mention how \"god like\" his aspirations for early retirement were and how he was the best programmer and could do anything. Everyone around him was labeled as \"dumb\" \"annoying\". \n\nI started to run out of money and needed to move back home for work. I could tell I was being slowly discarded as he was needing more internet private time and making future plans without me. He told me he never said he wanted me to meet his mom and I made it up, that he never said he wanted to get married, and that he wanted \"nothing explicit\" out of the relationship. I could tell things were ending, so I started to apply for jobs back home and noped out ASAP. My suspicions of other women were met with \"you're crazy\" \"your craziness caused our breakup\" \"you're toxic\" \"you're paranoid\" \"you're delusional\" \"you're bipolar\" ( I certainly felt bipolar during the end of the relationship). My intuition was right about him moving on as he hung out with his old Tinder fling he met previously on New Years (and was even kind enough to send me the pictures). I felt sick to my stomach to see it and even after a few weeks of being away from him still felt so attached. Finally, I told him I felt suicidal and couldn't take the pain of the relationship and that it needed to end for good. I blocked him on all social media channels. Two weeks later he sent me emails talking about the \"great future\" we could've had, my \"negative tantrums\" ruining everything, but despite that he still \"loved me the entire time\" and wanted to get married. I kept ignoring, but finally gave in to a final phone call in which I called him out for being a narcissist and a POS (this was a horrible idea on my part because it wiped away all of my previous healing; he acted like the man I fell in love with). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to tell my story, so people can relate and help heal themselves. I certainly felt like I was going crazy towards the end. I'm in the abuse amnesia stage where I keep reflecting on the past and the good times (there were quite a few really good times as well), but having a hard time letting go and realizing that it really was a bad situation and the idealization of what \"future\" he offered was never real.

I'm going to tell the story in order of what I remembered, to help understand my thought process. I'm sorry if it gets confusing.\n\nI have a deeply narcissistic mother who views me as an extension of herself, and who desperately needs every person she meets to adore her. I went through a lot of emotional abuse from her. As a kid, she would always show me off (\"look at how smart/pretty/thin/polite my daughter is! Isn't she wonderful?\") in order to get compliments. Any \"compliments\" aimed at me were, in her mind, really about her.\n\nWhen I was around 7 or 8 years old, my parents' marriage hit a rough patch. I know this because they yelled a lot, and she told me about their financial issues and my father's flaws in great detail. She even told me about threatening to cheat on him.  \n\nAround this time, my mother met a man who lived a couple of streets down from us. She visited him a lot, and brought me with because he'd requested that she do so. I don't remember his face or his name. All I remember is the way he smelled (engine grease, beer, and stale cigarette smoke), the sound of his voice, and his hands when he would play with my hair or hold the back of my neck while he said over and over how *pretty* I was and how long and soft and beautiful my hair was. \n\nI hated it. I hated him. I didn't want to go, but Mom made me. I didn't want to hug him (he was constantly hugging me and touching my face and hair and neck) but Mom demanded that I hug him anyway so I didn't embarrass her or hurt his feelings. I learned pretty quickly that I wasn't allowed to tell him no. Mom wouldn't let me, and if I tried to squirm away anyway, he'd squeeze the back of my neck, or if his hand was on my shoulder, his thumb would move over to my collarbone and push hard against it. My mom never noticed. I learned to just go away inside my head during visits with him until it was time to go home.\n\nI don't remember how long this went on. Maybe weeks or months. He started attending or church with my mom (my dad is an atheist and refused to go to church) and visiting our house when dad wasn't home. Then, one day, it abruptly ended. He didn't come around, and I was told not to go down the street he lived on under any circumstances.\n\nI was just happy I didn't have to see him any more. I didn't understand, though, why I had so many nightmares after that, or why the thought of washing between my legs when I bathed made me feel like I was going to vomit. Why I was afraid of boys and men I didn't know well. But, life went on. My parents stayed together. We moved a year later to another neighborhood about five miles away. \n\nFast forward to me at 21 or 22, in community college, still living at home. I walk out of my bedroom, and my mom, always one for drama, comes up to after watching the news, and excitedly says:\n\n\"Did you hear about the child molester in our old neighborhood?\"\n\nNo. What the hell?\n\n\"A boy and his little sister were at the playground, and the sister wandered off, and the boy found her a few minutes later with a man who had his hand down her pants! He yelled and the guy ran off and the kids went home and told their mom, who called the police. They haven't found him!\"\n\nThat's horrible. Why are you telling me this?\n\n\"Oh, I bet it's the same guy that tried to molest you when you were a kid! Don't you remember?\"\n\nShe said it casually, excited to make this tragedy about us. I didn't remember. I stared at her.\n\n\"Yeah, he hung around a lot and flattered me. Until the day we were hanging out and he asked for a glass of water, and I walked back into the room to find him running his hand up your thigh. You remember that, right? I screamed at him and threw him out and said to never show his face at or place again. He was really angry, but I want going to let anyone hurt you. Don't you remember?\"\n\nI didn't. I didn't remember at all. I COULDN'T remember. I asked if she called the police.\n\n\"Oh, no. I made sure he'd never do anything to you again. I protected you.\"\n\nI didn't say so, but I started to remember a little. I remembered still being allowed to run around the neighborhood unsupervised. I remembered her telling me not to goo down the street he lived on. As if that made months of grooming better. I asked her, what about the other kids? There were dozens of other kids in that neighborhood. Dozens of vulnerable little girls. What about them?\n\nShe just started at me blankly, baffled at my lack of admiration for her \"bravery\" in kicking him out and basically putting the responsibility of not getting molested again on me at the age of eight.\n\nOver the next few months and years, I started to remember. I remembered my dog getting out and going with my brother and a group of other neighbor kids to tri and catch him. I remember splitting up and being sent down his street to look for my dog. I remember standing at the end of his driveway, frozen, with him in front of me. I remember how he smelled. Engine grease, cigarettes, beer, and what I would later know to be pot. I remember his hand on the back of my neck, guiding me up to his front door. I remember how dark it was inside.\n\nI remember standing back at the end of the street, feeling numb. The other kids were there, with my brother and my dog, asking where I'd been. I remember my mouth speaking without me telling it to, saying I just went to look for the dog. I remember them looking at me like I way crazy, and the oldest going, \"... Ok. Well, it's getting dark. We should all go home.\"\n\nI remember suddenly realizing the streetlights were coming on. I didn't remember it getting that late. It shouldn't have been that late. Why was it so late?\n\nI look back on that moment, and I'm sad and furious for me. I think that was the last time he abused me, but I can't be sure. I still can't remember the abuse itself. I'm 98% sure I was sexually abused by at least one other man not long after that. My friend's father, at her fucking birthday party. I blocked that out, too. Like with the other stuff, I only remember before and after the abuse.\n\nI'm still angry at my mother. Before she told me, I didn't realize anything more than grooming had happened to me. I didn't realize she knew. I still can't believe she didn't call the cops. Possibly because she didn't want Dad to know she was cheating on him, and dragged me along into it. Fucking narcissistic bitch. The grooming was happening right there in front of her eyes. She just refused to see it.\n\nAnyway, I mostly just needed to get this out. Writing things out helps me process. I can't afford to get therapy for this and my narc mother's abuse yet.

I graduated college years ago but have not had a job in 2 years because my mother is very emotionally abusive and controlling. She locked me out of my bank account taking ownership over it. It is all the money I saved up from gift money from relatives, and when I did have a job and earned income. I can't even try to talk to the bank about it because I fear what I'll face from my mother while I still live with her. She took my car from me.

Yet I was banned from doing any of that. I don't have any happy childhood memories.\n\nShe bans me from eating the \"good\" food in the house because it is for my precious sister. So I have to scavenge through old food and she insults me for being a pig eating anything. She taunts that if I want something to eat then I should buy it myself but wait I don't have money to spend or a car to get to the store haha. She throws it in my face that I should be grateful for how she allows me to live on her dime because she buys the food and it gives her permission to treat me however she wants and if she does not want me to eat then she has a right to dictate that too.\n\nShe uses me as a scapegoat for any anger she feels.

Talking to my mom about how I feel is useless, already tried. She just verbally abuses me more . She does not see how her behavior is wrong because nothing she does to me is wrong in her own eyes. I just think the best thing for us is separation. Maybe one day she will realize what she has done if I make a life for myself and she's not included.\n\nI am afraid of talking to my dad about it. He does love me, I just know that he's disappointed in me. To him I'm just a jobless adult living at home for 2 years. He is always working so he does not know what actually happens.

Yet, I feel so pathetic because I am afraid to leave even though I am so desperate for it. I have no idea what the real world is like because my mother's control is all I've ever known.
