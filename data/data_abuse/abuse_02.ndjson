I'd like to understand and possibly help the behaviour of my father.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm 24M, and living like this for so long has definitely had devastating effects on me, but let's not talk about that now.  I'll try to explain the patterns and if someone can help with advice or a possible diagnose I'd be very thankful.  At least I'm old enough to leave and live on my own and I should've already done it long ago.  \n\n  \nSo, my father has been an alcocholic for as far as I can remember, but I'm don't think that alone can lead to such behaviour.  Years ago he used to drink harder stuff, but after he had a pancreatic operation, he's been drinking just wine most of the time. I guess around at least 1, probably 2 liters per day. Consuming it in small amounts during the entire day, while driving, while working, at home.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe has never acknowledged that he has a problem, even though we've tolerated it and lived like this for more than a decade. He is the kind of person that would never be satisfied with anything done by others. Not just that, he'd get unimaginably irritated by even the slightest of things. It's hard to describe it, but no matter what you do it's never the right thing.  \n\nAs an example, it applies to literally anything, but let's say that he's behaving like a relatively normal person for once, you're making a salad and you put the ingredients in a different order than he would. Of course, there is no right order, because the right way is always different for him. That may cause his entire behaviour to snap to this other person. Best case scenario in this case, he'd not talk to anyone for the rest of the evening, not eat with us and look everyone with an expression full of hatred.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe never talks about what he thinks is wrong and never attempts to resolve a problem like a normal human being. He expects that everyone should already know why he's displeased and he's looking at his own family with hatred like we're his mortal enemy. He always looks down on everyone, something that I've inherited, but thankfully I've started giving the benefit of the doubt to people. He's constantly slamming doors, occasionally breaking dishes, throwing away food just after it's been prepared, breaking electronic devices.  Sometimes doesn't eat on the same table or speak to us for months, because ... There is no good reason, but supposedly because he has something against my mother. Back when me and my brother were smaller, we'd never both be on good terms with him. It always felt like he preferred one and hated the other. This has switched between us several times.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother is the most selfless person I know. She's never done anything for herself, barely sees her friends, the few that are left after my father has pushed away any family friends that they might have had when they were young. Works a full dayjob and when not that always does things around the appartment. She hardly ever confronts him about anything, but the few times she's done, It's never ended with anything good. She should've left him years ago, but she never did.  \n\n  \nLiving like this I've learned to be obidient, anxcious, antisocial, afraid, silent - because not once have I spoken my opinion it ended well - I've been struggling with communicating like a normal person for the better part of my life.   \n\n  \nHe's never physically abused us, but he's been controlling and unpredictable enough that I've been afraid not so much for myself, but for my mother and my little brother. I can't exclude the possibility that he could just snap one day and do the unthinkable. It's actually one of the reasons I'm still living with my family. I don't want to leave them alone with him.

Order, balance, and harmony are things that human beings seek out and thrive in. A narcissist destroys  the order, balance, and harmony that we all need to feel safe, secure, and frankly, sane. \n\nA narcissist will make one set of rules for you, then turn around and throw all that out the window, so that what you thought you were doing right, now becomes wrong. You could do or say something one day, and it will gain a positive response - but the next day, when you do the same thing, you get raged at. Some quality or trait about you makes the narcissist happy today, but tomorrow they can't stand that very thing about you, and you find yourself being punished for it. \n\nTrying to be in any kind of relationship with these people will drive even the most intelligent, logical, capable person insane. In fact, it's probably that very type of person who is driven the *most* insane by a narcissist. You're looking for order, structure, and flow. You're looking for peace and a sense of stability. You're looking for A to lead to B. But with a narcissist, A can lead to B, or G, or Y, without any warning and with no real rhyme or reason behind it, other than the narcissist's own disordered thinking and petty whims. \n\nAnd the worst part about it is, we lose the ability to take care of ourselves in the process, because all our energy is being drained out of us, trying to keep up with the constantly-shifting reality that the narcissist perpetuates. Our focus is being pulled in a million different directions, and that lack of foundation causes everything else in our life to fall apart, too. A narcissist is like an earthquake to the bedrock of our being. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She began to take out her anger on us (she was still very strict before) but it only got worse. As a kid, watching television, playing video games, and using the computer we're absolutely forbidden. We spent all our (brother and sister) time locked in the dark frigid basement dreaming about what it would be like to live more normal lives like the kids at school who excluded us out of everything because we weren't normal. As a kid punishments would come by being whipped for up to 20 minutes with a hangar, usually several because they would break after a few hard smacks, no food, no water, no washroom - for days if on Easter or Christmas break, splashing boiling or ice cold water at us, the steel edge belt, several hour long lectures where I have actually passed out after standing up for 11 hours straight and not having eaten anything or sleeping the day before. We would also be forced to take cold showers in the middle of the winter with the windows open, like water boarding basically or be beaten with a broom up to a hundred times just for forgetting or missing a speck on wall. Then we have to reclean it for up to an hour as she screams and yells at us and throws or kicks the back of our heads into the wall and forces us to clean the blood off of the wall and floor etc. \n\nThen one day there was a turning point, our elementary principal got fed up with all the scars on our body, withdrawal from school, especially the large slash only face that made me look like scarface. She called CPS and they visited us 8 times in 10 months. It was a joke, the dates that they visited we're all pretty discussed, informed, and my mother even bought cinnamon rolls and soft drinks and prepared them for the visitors after making me and my brother sparkle down the house for hours. She made sure to reheat those treats until the icing was melting and those retards came over with their stupid concerned faces on. She beat up my brother and forced him to tell them that all the scars on myself were from fights with him or other kids. Anyway, they never show up again and I am viscously strangled, chocked, and was even thrown onto the pavement once in the basement where my 200 pound brother jumped in the air and slammed my head right into the floor leaving me with a large slash on my scalp, and surprisingly no brain - I think. One time was so bad that I knew I was going to die or something, after being punched in the face around 50 times and suffocated until I couldn't think straight or see anything, I was in so much pain that I actually ignored how shy I am of a person and pushed my mother against the wall and ran out of the house. I could barely grip the handle because my hands were covered in blood from before the punching ensued since she slashed my chest earlier, either way I was able to out run her obese self simply by running through the halls by memorization of the house interior (couldn't open my eyes, way too bruised). I took off for the school but this was on a weekend, I never knew any other place to go to except there ( I was 14 ) - and these beatings happened on nearly a daily basis though I was always singled out and was basically the scapegoat of all the family problems.\n\n\nAfter all these incidents it has become insanely clear that she hates us, she told us that she wants us to die and regretted having us. As she the years have passed she has become more aware that she has no education, no professional job, absolutely no savings, no house, zero credit, no spouse (no sh##), no inheritance, she would be denied a mortgage at every turn, though she never tries to get one since she wouldn't have the means to pay for one anyway. \n\nShe changed her mind about us getting the hell out of her life, and has now decided that we are absolutely forbidden from talking to anyone - especially females - and that when we become legally adults we will be forced to stay with her for the rest of our lives, no marriage, no friends, we will have to get professional careers however, but no contact with any coworkers, oh yeah and we will have to buy her a large house so she can compare with some unknown relatives or friend + whatever's cars she wants to own or lease all straight out of our pockets. She owns 5 phones and one laptop which my brother uses for his University research. \n\nNormally this wouldn't concern me but my brother graduated high school last year with a 97% average and almost 20k in scholarships on top of being valedictorian. All the money went to her bank account and she even spent some of the non designated award money on her personal life and shoes and stuff without a single word in opposition. He is completely brainwashed by her and is basically a servant like slave. He always was the teachers pet type so he tries to always make her happy no matter what ways she tortures him mentally or physically.\n\nDon't think the beatings have stopped however, I'm 16 now and had the living #### beat out of me with a wire hangar ( 2 since the first one broke and so did the second one). Then was smacked across the face so many times that my face burns as I type this. My brother left his laptop on and logged in, so I shall post my story on Reddit.\n\nWhat do I do? RUN? OR WAIT?\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I keep not being sure because...well I'll explain after.\n\nThrowaway account because I'm really detailed here and I'm fucking embarassed and ashamed.\n\nWhen I was 6-7, my grandmother used to help me masturbate. She never touched me, I touched myself. But she watched, and she would go through extremely kinky/sexual roleplays with me verbally until I had \"a really good feeling\", which of course I didn't understand. But I liked doing it. But...I was a child. It doesn't matter that I liked it, right? Or is that normal?\n\nI recently found film of one of the times. My dad filmed it, said he thought it was \"cute,\" (on the film, he was explaining why he was trying to film) and my grandma said \"We need privacy, come on!\" like...jokingly. Like it was funny or normal. I had...such a breakdown upon seeing this that I honestly can't explain. I was, up until that point, only about 97% sure it happened at all. There was still that chance I imagined it.\n\nBut I remembered when I saw it. We would go behind the chair downstairs and do that, and I even asked my dad after the first time I did it why it felt good and he said \"haha uhh I don't know\" and brushed it off. \n\nI also believe my grandfather abused me. I have years of missing memories of afternoons spent alone with him after school. In fact, I hardly have any memories at all before the age of 10. He has stared at me sexually since before I was even going though puberty, has groped my breasts, all to the point I'm still too scared to be around him or walk around the house in anything but extremely baggy clothes that hide my body, and turn my back to him if he sees me. \n\nThis has all beyond fucked me up. I continued to be sexual throughout my entire childhood, was writing sex and rape and incest stories at 7 or 8, and showed every mental symptom of childhood sexual abuse and still continue to. They actually got worse as time went on, the groping happened during my teenage years and there was other physical/emotional abuse from my family and Christ...the stares. The constant stares, looking up and down my body, remembering how I used to kiss him on the lips and how disgusting he looks at me and...I used to sleep in the same fucking bed as them and I just...it ruined me.\n\nAnyway. Was it sexual abuse, what happened with my grandmother? It destroys me that every one would watch me orgasm, including my pervert of a grandfather. I know it happened. It wasn't even secretive or anything. And after it was normal, I would act out my kinks with my barbie dolls during play time and shit. I would try to make out with my dad, or get really weirdly close while sleeping and try to press against him or literally anything I could, sexually. The fucking film I found was me on top of a pillow, you know...between my legs and shit, and...I was so tiny and young and Jesus Christ I want to vomit. Some of the shit he filmed makes me so uncomfortable, like when he would kiss all over me when I was asleep and film it, down my arms and face and everything and I know it was loving but it still makes me so uncomfortable. And one time he spanked me so hard as a little kid that I couldn't sit down or move and there was a hand imprint and he made me lay with my pants down on the bed so he could rub lotion on it and it wasn't fucking sexual and yet I just SO vividly remember how suddenly uncomfortable I was, my exact thoughts were \"I need to pull my pants up I don't want them looking at me down there anymore, I need to be covered, this is bad.\" Like it just makes me convinced other things were happening around that time, I just repressed most of them.\n\nMost. Most of them. Not all.\n\nBut...was I just a fucking disgustingly sexual child? Can children be born that way? Just...gross? Or??? I'm so fucking lost. I'm so lost. I'm. So. Fucking.

I want to preface all this by saying I am not small. I am not weak. I am 6'0\" 215+ lbs. I played football for 8 years between youth and high school. I have been in many fights. Won some/ lost some. And yet here I sit. Writing. I don't even know what I am doing this for. I don't really think advice will help. But yeah, so.. I had a very physically/ emotionally abusive girlfriend in high school. She started out by just  being very manipulative. It was the first girl I had sex with so needless to say I was whipped. But it was beyond that. I was owned. I don't even really remember the whole experience. But I do remember being slapped across the face so hard that my ear started bleeding. I was with her for 2 excruciatingly long years. \n\nI got out. I graduated before her. I went to school. And I WENT. I moved from California to North Carolina. Met a nice older woman. She was 8 1/2 years my senior. We would flirt and talk a lot. Extenuating circumstances actually ended up kind of forcing us to live together. I was very hesitant to get involved with her in a relationship because of what I had already been thru. But one drunken night ended up connecting us on an intimate level. And from there the feels took me to a whole new place. Now the first year and a half were like cloud nine compared to my previous run with dating. But there were some red flags. Just certain remarks that were made and the reactions to things that I did, or didn't do. But nothing crazy. So after dating for few years we got married. \n\nThen it was like the bottom fell out. We had lost multiple pregnancies so that part was straining enough on the both of us. There was a lot of self blame on her part, but at the same time she would lash out at me. And I was always supportive. Things would get better, then they would get worse. Eventually she cheated on me. And I cheated on her. and then I left her. After 8 years of a marriage roller coaster. I left her. It took another year and a half to be clear of her from my life completely. \n\nNow in and amongst all this cheating and mutual betrayal, I met someone. Someone who seemed so soft and fragile, having dealt with her own marital issues. So after I left my marriage. I pretty much fell straight into another relationship. Against the better judgement of my family and friends. Everything was good. Again some red flags here and there. Somethings were definitely my fault. But some things she would just blow way out of proportion. Now I did it again... I got married to her. I love her. And I love her kids. She had 4 kids. And I truly do love them. And they love me. I really down want to leave them. But.. I am getting to my dark place again.. I have been kicked, shoved, hit. Sometimes its like playful at first, but it turns mean.. I am made to feel inadequate. I support the whole family, and I am told I don't do enough. I am a bad person for fighting back when she blows up. I have been told that I am hated. Multiple times she told me we shouldn't be together, which I really don't want a second divorce. If I don't do something exactly the way she wants it, she acts like I am burdening her. I don't kiss right.. I don't hug her at the right times. I just don't know what to do anymore. I have started looking for someone to make another connection with. Maybe just to make me feel human again. Yes, I am saying I have tried to find somebody to have an emotional affair with. I am so lost, but at the same time, I don't think I can leave, I don't want to leave the kids. I just hate feeling this way. And I would never hit her back. As much as I have wanted to.. I don't know.. If you read this far, thanks I guess. I know a lot of this is very vague. I am sorry for how messy it is. I guess I just needed to vent. Thanks.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I\u2019m no longer hurt by people he manipulated into turning against me and even doing acts against me in our small tight knit mutual industry, and even when I\u2019ve seen them go through horrors, such as injury or imprisonment, I am able to actually be the bigger person to people I once wished death upon and actually tell them that I hope they will be okay. \n\nI realized this the other day I think, when I saw someone who is still one of his best friends.

His eyes looked sunken in his head and he looked 20 years older than the year and half since I had seen him last. When a year and a half ago I would have brandished my anger and wished him this fate, when a year ago I may have not done that but would have still felt his fate was justified through karma, instead....I was very shocked by my own feelings and actions.

I could see the strings he had been on (and may still be) of the N and just felt pity. I think that feeling is forgiveness? Idk.

My self-confidence could not be ignored; it was like a moth to a flame, him to me. He gave me the most intense feelings of love and acceptance - emotions that I had never been privy to before. It was me and him against the world. \n\nBut then we moved in together. I moved across the country to be with this guy and it wasn't a sacrifice. What people don't understand about happiness is that it goes both ways. I moved in with him because I wanted to be happy just as much as I wanted him to be happy, too. I was able to make choices and decisions that were no more difficult than they would have been if you stayed behind. Living with him quickly became a dream, which quickly turned into a nightmare.\n\nIt was fine at first; he didn't have, or want, a job because he wanted to focus on grad school full time - even though he wasn't taking a full course load. But it's okay, I am experienced with working and going to school so that's what I would do. I will work. I will go to grad school. I will be the breadwinner. I will work yourself raw so he won't have to worry. I will buy groceries and take him out and spoil him because he's never been in a relationship with someone who cherished him as I do. I never mention to him that I was making little more than minimum wage and racking up credit card debt just to make him feel loved. He tells me he loves me.\n\nIt went from 0 to 100 so quick. He never wants to do the things that I want to do. I make a suggestion but he doesn't like it, so we do what he wants instead. I just want to make him happy. When he's happy, I'm happy. I start to lose interest in the things about myself that he doesn't like. I trained myself to be content with his choices and decisions. I start to believe that what I like is \"wrong\" and what he likes is \"right.\" He tells me he loves me.\n\nBut this can't be how relationships work... I am always happy to do things that make him happy, so why does he make me feel miserable for doing the things I want to do? Why does he act depressed and miserable when I pick out the movie? I finally step up for myself. I try and get him to understand and he always says, \"I'm sorry, I'll try harder next time.\" I mention it again, \"I'm trying.\" I bring it up again, \"get off my balls, you're suffocating me.\" He still tells me he loves me.\n\nHe tells me that I have an anger management problem. I tell him that I'm sick of being made to feel like my individuality is a problem to him. I scream at him because he's not listening, but he cannot respect me when I raise my voice - when I stand up to him. He cannot listen to me. He cannot comprehend what I am saying. He cannot hear the truth. He cannot feel my pain. He does not care. But, he tells me he loves me.\n\nI tell him to give me space. He wants to be around me all the time, knowing what i'm doing and preferably doing it with him. He does not know how to be alone so he will not leave me alone either. I want quiet. I want peace. I want calm. I want to be who I used to be. I want to be alone. He does it because he loves me.\n\nHe lies to me. All. The. Time. About little things, big things, important things, anything. He gets a job. He meets a girl. She is his confidant. She is his connection. I find out. He tells me that she means nothing. He tells me he will stop talking to her. He lies. I find out. He tells me that I mean everything. He tells me he will stop talking to her. He lies again. I find out. He tells me that he did nothing wrong. He tells me that I'm suffocating him. He tells me he will stop talking to her. He tells me he loves me and only me.\n\nI try to find myself again. Who I was, who I want to be, where I want to go, with whom I want to go.

I didn't understand at the time why he kept telling me about how much effort he put into his exes and not me. Again because I was filling in the gaps.

Either way, we got well again, but she didn't appreciate me looking through her Snapchat account. After that, she broke up with me yet again, and told me I'm the worst person ever since then. She told me everything bad there is to say about a person, and even said she wanted me to die. \n\nThe thing is, she changed me. I don't feel like myself anymore, but like a minor version of her. I've been walking on eggshells for so long, it makes me feel mentally unstable. I'm so confused, I don't know what to feel anymore, and how nice I try to be, it's never enough not to make her snap at me in everything she says. She's even another boy three days after we broke up, who's 'way better than me', who's so perfect and who'd 'never screw her over like that'. I know that looking through someone's Snapchat is a violation of privacy, and I acknowledge that what I did was wrong, but all this does seem a bit over the top to me for that.\n\nShe always keeps me addicted to her by writing chapters on an app and publish them. She knows I'm clingy, she knows I have difficulties letting her go, and she knows I read them. In those, she writes how much she misses me, how much she loves me, but when we actually talk, she doesn't sound like she cares about me at all.\n\nI used to be nice and calm, but I don't feel like me anymore. As I said, she turned me into someone like her. I get defensive and passively aggressive way more often than I used to, but when I do, she blames me for it. She says 'look at yourself', or 'how dare you say that to me, the person you claim you love', so that the focus, blame and responsibility is not on her, but on me. Nothing is ever her fault, it's always mine. I fuck up, she never does. She used to take the blame for her actions too often, but nowadays she doesn't anymore. She doesn't even seem to remember her wrongdoings from the past. And while everything she says is a snap, she always says 'I'm not mad, it's your fault for being easily hurt' or 'you're overreacting to everything', or, one of my favourites, 'you're so delusional, everything is important to you'.\n\nI know I should block her like she blocks me sometimes, but forever. The thing is that I really love her. I want to help her change, because I do believe she's a good person deep inside. I just don't know what to do anymore.\n\nTL;DR Am I suffering from narcissistic abuse victim syndrome? What can I do about this? ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

There is a real connection between us as I am Intp personality we are very similar in many ways. He knows I can understand him.

She is the worst type of person, an extreme narcisist, constantly negative, paranoid, aggresive and violent. She shows no love to our son and has no empathy. She is a bully who hates herself so much that her main priority in life is to destroy mine no matter the consequences. I have to agree with everything she says or she begins shouting me down and often becomes physically violent towards me. This behaviour deeply upsets my son and she knows that hurts me so i do not engage in an argument and im often forced to leave my house at unsociable hours.

It's been immensely helpful in keeping me grounded and processing everything I went through with the nex.\n\nI've gone NC and failed multiple times over the course of the five year relationship. I finally managed to go NC last year when I traveled out of state to stay with my half-brother for a while. I found out while I was here that Nex had yet another affair, actually broke up a family this time as the affair partner was married with kids. Friend of the narc tattled because he felt bad seeing Nex call me up and talk sweet and then brag about sleeping with her. That was the final straw for me. Nex tried to deny, gaslight etc but something in me just snapped. \n\n\nNex doesn't know where my half brother lives, I left my old job and found a new one, went blank on all social media, the whole nine yards. Snuck back into town once to get my things, say goodbye to my roommate, finalize the move. Nex attempted to Hoover repeatedly and I stayed strong. It's been nearly a full year since I left for what I thought would be a short visit. I am lonely (no dating yet) but starting to feel like myself again, starting to let go of the constant anger.\n\nUntil today when I accidentally found my Nex on Reddit. He posted on a sub he knew I used to be active on. Used the same username he uses on everything else. \n\nI checked his post history and found he'd posted in relationship subs about being heartbroken about his girlfriend \"randomly disappearing\" and how she was \"crazy paranoid I was cheating when I totally wasn't\". Giving others advice about how to get over being \"fucked over\" by a person you trusted. Commenting that he would never be in another relationship again while simultaneously responding to all posts made by women about being heartbroken simpering and asking if they need a \"friend to talk to\". Of course, only women who specify that they're under 25 (Nex is almost 40, I'm in the same age group). Exactly the same pattern I've seen for years, messaging young women on different outlets pretending he wants to be friends. \n\nI feel thrown. There was a big part of me that wanted to contact him and demand how he could be so delusional, how he could be seeking sympathy for me leaving him after years of gaslighting and cheating and emotional abuse? How he could outright lie and casually say I'm paranoid and he didn't cheat, when his affair partner divorced and apparently was devastated that Nex discarded her as soon as her husband found out? They worked together and it was a huge scandal! I know if I contact him he will deny everything and attack me, we all know there's no point arguing with these people. But it still just threw me off balance... I wanted to get it off my chest and I know here is the right place. My best friend and everyone else in my life right now would panic if I brought him up at all and think I'm considering going back. \n\nTl;dr found Nex on Reddit posting he was heartbroken by his girlfriend (me) leaving because I assumed he cheated when he didn't, when he did cheat and more than once!

(my child) when it was just my child and him we were always happy. He took her in as his own, as her father was very absent. He always made sure we had food clothes and a roof over our heads. \n\nAfter about a year or so, he started to drink more and more. That is when I noticed his behavior. When he was intoxicated he would call me horrible names, names that would make a sailor blush. He never ever apologizes for his actions and verbal abuse.  He now will get are our kids to gain up on me. He tells them that I am a shit ass mom, a whore, a cunt, and will tell the children to call whatever name he can come up with. My one child will call me the name then when their dad goes to sleep my child will say mommy I am sorry i called you that name, daddy made me. \ud83d\ude1e He has kicked me out of the house on several occasions. Threatens to divorce, my white trash ass (his words not mine) and take all the children from me. \n\nWhen he gets in his mood he is just down right rude to me or anyone for that fact. He is never verbally abusive to the children, but I fear that my kids will grow up and believe that this is how you treat others or be treated by others. He has never laid a finger on me. But I cannot take this verbal abuse any longer. I would love to divorce him, but I am terrified that we will have to move. We just moved the kids into a new school this year.

When we started I was told a lot by people who know her I should be careful because she was playing around with guys back in Japan a lot. I knew this already, also because when we met one year before our relationship we talked a lot about these topic and since I wasn't really looking for a serious relationship at the time I was ok with that.\n\nHowever one thing let to an other and our relationship become serious. Well at the beginning everything was bright and nice but soon after it started. From the time a got to know here we had one mutual (female) friend who also did the exchange year. However it happens that they become to dislike each other until hate from my gfs side and I was told to hate her, too. We didn't solved the problem because I can't \\*snap\\* hate someone, so it still comes up from time to time. Worth mentioning I have no contact no contact to the friend at all anymore and little to no contact while they both where doing the exchange year.\n\nLater when her year in Germany was going to be over, I didn't set much hope in a future together, since Japanese exchange students in my university tend to fall back into their previous lives, so I experienced many broken relationships and friendships in my friends and acquaintance. I thought it was a good time until then and move on some time. However we managed to keep our long distance relationship (ldr) with daily video talks and so on. Maybe she really changed from the I was told \"least trustworthy, and impulsive person\" to better. In addition she changed her mind about her future and really set effort into her grades and finding a job. Ofc there were many opportunities to betray or cheat on me but why she should kept the effort to keep this relationship going instead of canceling all contacts with me.\n\nJump to August last year.\n\nMaking a plan since May I finally managed to move to Japan. We moved together which is rare in Japan before marriage and that\u2019s where my suffering begun.\n\nWhile on ldr we talked a lot how living together would be and since we have a spare room, she said she would be happy if friend have a sleepover or stay longer if some of my german friend come to visit. So a good (male) friend of mine came to Japan in September and we planned him to stay for a little more then two weeks what she was totally fine with. Unfortunately, from the second day of his stay she got into bad mood and things, also didn\u2019t want to talk about it, but it was clearly visible for me (and my friend) that is was bc of him. So he offered soon to look for another accommodation but I should hurry to decide since some special offer was going to end. I had a long talk with my gf in the night concluding he could stay longer and we try to include her more (we already tried). Anyway right after his offer ends I had a new long argument with her about his stay ending in either he goes or she will go to her parents home while he is here. I promised him he could stay but a also didn\u2019t want such a bad start after one year of ldr so unfortunately I had him to go which strongly damaged our friendship. \n\nShe guilted me I\u2019ve should have known better that\u2019s to much stress for her in the new situation of living together and she first wants figure out everything, bla bla bla,\u2026 Also she insisted of not being the guilty one for this problem. This theme became a tabu in the future.\n\nI am working at 2 part time jobs so I have around 60000 yen per month (rent+additional cost are about 43000 yen). She has around 50000 yen per month and her mom paying for all the running costs. We do most of the shopping for food together and splitting the bill. You can see me going negative at the end of the month, but I try to lend least money as possible from her. In compensation I do 90% of the cooking since I am better at this and she\u2019s having stress bc of her part time/graduation thesis. Also, I do most of the garbage and cleaning while she mostly does the laundry sorting(loading). 50/50 on drying the cloths. So household is mostly no problem. \n\nLater she developed a strong jealousy. Me using Facebook she occasionally took a look over my shoulder and asked who is this and that, especially if some posters were female. She asked where I know them from, if I have contact to them and if not, why I don\u2019t delete them since I don\u2019t talk to them anyways \u2013 she does so. Usually I talked myself out of deleting my friend list, so she said she was ok with it, but clearly wasn\u2019t. It got worse later when she got mad at my because I was pointing out something funny or weird on a girl/women we just went by. She doing the same is totally fine. I genuinely think my gf is more beautiful than every other women I ever saw, but for her its not enough to be more beautiful, she also wants me to think any other female is ugly. Eventually this is ending in I shouldn\u2019t even look at women in TV. \n\nHer way of treating me when she\u2019s in a bad mood is having an argument, guilt me, crying, ignoring me whatever works best. My way is apologizing, explain why I said/did something and one time a had to should. I never touch her other than a cuddle or petting her, so I do not try to use any force on her. As you can see, it\u2019s ending up in me losing almost any argument. I tried her methods so she can see what it feels like but ofc it only got worse, so I don\u2019t try anymore.\n\nIt\u2019s already a wall of text so shorten from now on.\n\nWant else bothers me:\n\n\\- She always want compliments on her makeup and the reason way I said it\n\n\\- She likes sexy time (me too!) but is wearing something very fluffy unsexy and mostly lights out so sometimes I can\u2019t perfom well\n\n\\- As stress relief the likes to talk bad about things happened to her/coworkers,.. or simply be tease me. I\u2019m fine with that but it adds up lately so her stress become mine and if I don\u2019t look interested she gets mad at me.\n\n\\- Her jobs ends at 11pm, so I pick her up and we eat together back home so it gets very late around 1:30 or 2 am until we are in bed. If an argument happens I get no sleep until 4 or 5 am and my job starts between 7 and 10 am.\n\n\\- If she does something for me or her mom bought something for us (I/we didn\u2019t ask for), I have to be overly grateful\n\n\\- She doesn\u2019t use my name or some nickname at all\n\n\\- She never uses German or English even if she could.\n\nSo here\u2019s my problem. We are in a 2 year rental contract so there\u2019s a fee if we leave early. Also even if not I can\u2019t afford returning to Germany or rent a new apartment, so I\u2019m kinda stuck here.\n\nMaybe it will become better when I eventually get a real job or maybe I should just man up and sit through.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

We worked on the project on/off for a year, and I was finally ready to record it this Tuesday. \n\nI record all my stuff live, don't mix takes, no lip sync etc. By the fifth and final take I was raw with emotion and it would have been the last whether I'd nailed it or not. \n\nThis song, as well as my progress with my trauma was mainly my own journey, but I could not have done it without the support of wonderful people in my life. If you can, please take the 4 minutes to listen to my song... as I write at the end of it 'music is therapy, silence is death'.\n\nThank you\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvnMoHz2mX8", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

{"post_id": "amf4t1", "created_utc": 1549121965, "title": "[LONG] Is this abuse?", "author": "anjubilu", "self_text": "Before I start, I'd like to acknowledge that my entire family (including myself) needs more formal therapy and not advice from reddit, but I really just wanted to confirm some things (and rant I suppose) before I pull some kind of intervention for my mom.\n\nMain question I guess is: is this scenario some kind of abuse? My older brother (25) scares my entire family. He doesn't have a formal diagnosis, so I only have my own experiences to describe him. He's terribly mean and narcissistic. Has been since some time in grade school when he was bullied. At that time, he only took his anger out on me. The worst he would do was hit me (this stopped extremely fast once my parents noticed), but he'd also do things like dump water on my bed before I went to sleep, tell me to shut up whenever I spoke to him or anyone else. He also exhibited this behavior towards my younger brother, minus the hitting. He was extremely rude and mean to my parents as well.\n\nMy parents and therapists somehow decided after years of this that the problem couldn't be solved and we as siblings needed to be separated. My older brother was no longer allowed to interact with me and my younger brother. Around that time, I think the anger issue became apparent. My older brother's temper came on quick and strong for almost anything that inconvenienced him or worse. When my brother is angry, he really blows up. He screams, curses, stomps, throws things, breaks things. I vividly remember me and my younger brother cowering in the basement when we were younger while my older brother had various freakouts. \n\nThis behavior has continued for years, and while his blow ups are less frequent as he has graduated college and took on a full-time job, he is still a mean person prone to blow up without warning. The main person affected now is my mother. She basically does everything for him. She cooks his food, washes his clothes, cleans his room and bathroom, packs his stuff when he's going away. He also makes her deal with doctors and car repairs and the like. And he his extremely ungrateful. He is always rude to her, always tells her to shut up or go away or call her a f*cking moron (exact words I'm hearing him call her right now). When things go wrong for him (and things somehow ALWAYS go wrong for him and the world is out to get him), it's usually her fault and even if it's not, she still gets yelled at. My mom is a sweet person and was abused by her mom, so she doesn't stand up to him. \n\nHe doesn't interact with me or my younger brother now, but he scares me. I feel like I haven't scratched the surface of his scary behavior. Everything he does is punctuated by anger. He never walks, always stomps. He mutters things under his breath about how much he hates everyone. I'm terrified of being in the same room as him. I'm scared and sick of being in the same house as him. I'm tired of him treating my mom so terribly.\n\nMy parents are too scared of my brother to really do anything. They worry about how he'll react and what he'd do if they told him to move out. Any time they've confronted him about his behavior, he freaks out and makes everything so much worse for everyone in the house. We don't have the means to pay for his own place so he can just move out and leave, which would be the ideal solution for us.\n\nI do have anxiety, so I will admit that some of these perceptions and fears could be exacerbated by the anxiety, but I'm constantly scared and angry in my own home. I'm terrified of my mother getting hurt one day, but I'm also too scared of my brother to stand up for her. I feel trapped in my home and I know my mother must feel the same way. \n\nI've kept a level head for this entire post, but if I'm being honest, I hate him and I often have dreams where I hurt him and scream at him (I don't have any intentions or plans to actually attack him). At this point, I know I can't get rid of my brother, but I would like my mom to at least get some kind of support if this is abuse.\n\nTL;DR Angry and narcissistic older brother has a long history of being horrible to everyone in the family that continues up to today. My mother is now the main victim and personal assistant to him, and I worry for her mental health. Is his behavior abusive or just bad behavior/anger issues?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

After a while I realized he was narcissistic. At first he'd text every day for a good week or two then it died down (note: he always inititated text except for when I text to confront him. I also never told him good things about himself like he probably expected). He'd call or text at least once a week. Before I realized he was narcissistic, I just thought he was trying to \"play me\" so I'd call him out.\n\n I also recognized little digs he tried to make a few times so id come back with some and he'd try his hardest to come back from it. The only thing he could do was lie to make himself look good because he didnt have anything to say about me. One day I text him what was on my mind about him trying to make it seem like I was looking for him and whatever else to his friends. I tried to word it so that if he told his friends it would make him look bad &amp; expose him. He ended up trying to play nice like I was overreacting. I blocked his number for the final time and noticed he called my phone later that night. (Which happened to be minutes after he walked past my house with his friend). \n\nI guess it embarrassed &amp; pissed him off because afterwards he tried to make it seem like he was avoiding me or like I had \"too much going on\". I came into a corner store we both frequent and he was in there with friends. I didn't have to look up from my phone to know it either. I said hi to two guys who work there and went to talk to one. I heard him say something and then left with his friends following behind.\n\nI came out minutes later, heard music coming from the parking lot, so I looked over and saw a truck parked there. Then I heard someone say \"she's looking\". They really waited for me to come out to see what I'd do. Last night I went to the store and took a different path so I wouldn't run into him. After 5 minutes of being in there, he shows up, says something to some man and walks around for a minute then leaves. He went by like he didn't even see me. \n\nI thought he was already starting to discard me because of the drop in communication but this whole behavior makes me think hes just angry because I ignored him and others were around when it happened.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Not wanting to make it worse, I decided to let him in even though we were fighting. Then file a restraining order the next chance I had. \n\nHe came inside and immediately tried to kiss me, even though we've been broken up since December and had been fighting all day. I pulled away and went to the car to get what he brought for me and our four month old. But in the car was only her stuff, none of my stuff that he said he'd bring. When I asked if he brought it, he said, \"no, because I'm not supposed to care about you anymore.\" I asked why he tried to kiss me then. \"Manipulation,\" he said. Ugh...\n\nHe played with our daughter for about ten minutes then said he was leaving. So I took her and put her on the changing table to change her diaper. He kept trying to talk to me and I ignored him (which I do not advise). I told him I wasn't talking about relationship stuff anymore. He kept trying, I kept ignoring. Until he finally reached into my pocket to take my phone. But since it was in the other pocket, he wrapped his arms around me from behind and was trying to wrestle my phone out of my hand. I was screaming at him to let go of me, but he wouldn't. He finally got my phone and took off. I had to walk across the street to a nursing home and have them call the police. He brought my phone back before they showed up.\n\nHe is now trying to gaslight me by saying it didn't happen the way I said. First he said my phone was on my bed so he took it and ran. But now he's saying yes, it was in my pocket but he never touched me and I never screamed at him to get off me. \n\nAnyway. So after that, I no longer feel safe with him. It's escalating. So I'm getting an emergency order of protection on Monday and I'm going to a domestic abuse shelter to get legal assistance for custody. But I'm terrified of what's going to happen...\n\nIllinois is typically a 50/50 state. I don't want 50/50. I want sole custody with supervised visitation. His house is dangerous, with all the dogs and lack of heat upstairs where she would be sleeping (relies on space heaters). He is unstable and unpredictable, by showing up at my house in the middle of the night, regularly threatening suicide, twisting the truth and making shit up completely... \n\nI have a lot against him. Months and months of text messages and abuse, photos of his self harm wounds that he sent me, a previous order of protection, a dog killing a cat in his house, history of him drinking and driving, and not having a license... \n\nBut he has a lot on me too. I've smoked in the house while she was inside. Not right next to her, but still... I've slapped him. I've insulted him. I've wished him harm. I haven't had an actually paying job in a year because I worked for him. I was on Illinois medical and food stamps while living in his house in Missouri. My mom smokes weed...\n\nThere's just as much against me as him, I guess... And I'm afraid that we'll get joint custody, or the judge will believe his lies and charm and give him full custody... \n\nI can't lose my baby. He'd be a terrible father. He's screamed at her before. He never rocked her to sleep because his ADD wouldn't let him. He slept through her crying because he's a hard sleeper. He tries to play with her while I'm trying to put her to sleep, which just makes her more awake and over tired... He answers his phone while she naps and wakes her up so she never gets a long sleep. Or he plays on his phone instead of playing with her or rocking her. So he has one hand on her, eyes on the screen, and she's crying and he's just ignoring her... He treats her like he treats his dogs. Wants to let her cry it out (which isn't even advised until 6 months) and forces her to stay on a play mat for a minute longer than the day before, even if she's crying. Doesn't try to do anything different when she is crying (because she's bored), thinking she'll calm down eventually. He lets her cry until she hyperventilates or chokes because, \"there's nothing [he] can do!\"\n\nI don't think I'll be able to handle joint custody... But I can't do this with him anymore. He wants to take her every weekend and a couple times a week right now. Says he'll give me more in child support too. But I just can't do that. One, I want weekends too. But two and most importantly, I don't want her alone with him. Especially overnight. He doesn't know how to be a father. He wouldn't know what to do with her overnight. She cosleeps with me. If he put her in her crib, not only would she freeze because that room is so cold, but she wouldn't sleep. And if he tried cosleeping, he'd either roll over on her or a cat would smother her... \n\nUgh, I'm crying just thinking about it. \n\nI can't get this happen. I can't let him have her. There has to be SOMETHING I can do. I'm obviously going to get a lawyer, but... What kind of evidence should I gather? And if for some reason he does get joint custody, what can I do then? Hire someone to help him? I don't know. I'm so scared... Could use some advice.\n\nETA: DCFS just left my house. He told them I never let him see his daughter, that when he came over last there were bongs laying everywhere, that my mom grows and sells weed in the house, and that I cosleep with her, so I'm endangering her life. \n\nFortunately the case worker didn't believe him and is recommending it's closed and flagged as harassment.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My mother she isnt someone you would think would do this. She is manipulative. She doesnt care what you think. She doesnt care about what anyone thinks. My therapist who is helping me cope with this trama thinks she has schizophrenia. But i am not sure of that. With all of that said... let me share my story\nSo at 1-5 years old i was babysat by someone who was amazing. Honestly she was really nice and almost stood up to my mom. Ill call her wendy. One day i just stopped going to her house. I didnt know why so i asked since her and my mom were good friends. My mom says \"she tried to take you away...\" i soon found out the only thing she did was ask my mother to sign doctors notes so she could take me to the doctors as a legal guardian.\nSoon i got another babysitter. And another one. And another one..? I didnt know why at the time but now i do. Its because she didnt want to be caught verbally and mentally Breaking her child.\nShe thought that she had magical powers that jesus gave her and was being hunted by the fbi...\nWhen i was around 6 years old she got a fiancee. We will call him james \nI dont think they actually loved each other. It was a sugar daddy siduation. And i think thats how she got the money to buy things in the future.\nThey got in fights alot. But one day this was her breaking point\nThey pick me up from camp. My mom screaming and james and hitting him with a flipflop. I dont remember the reason \nI was crying in the back of the car huddled up almost screaming. I wanted to leave. \nWe get to the mansion james lived in and i ran inside and told my stepbrother the siduation. He hugged me and i ran and started putting as many things in a backpack that i could then my mom and james started fighting inside. She grabbed my hand and we walked out. My mom called one of my babysitters at the time and she picked us up... that was probably one of the scariest things i ever endured.. eventually we got a house and i got back to school she wanted me to be perfect.\nShe would wake 7-9 year old me up at 3 am and start drilling me math facts\nAnd if i got one wrong she would call me a bitch a brat anything she could think of while spitting in my face.\nNow when i was around 9 i think. She wanted to move because she lost her job. No we dont move like normal people... we instead pack all of our clothes and posessions small enough in garbage bags and then throw them into our car and leave.\nWe drove from Florida to nevada. \nIt took 5 days 10 hours each day. Its really fuzzy because she made me chug cough syrup to make me sleep. Because she didnt want to deal with it\nWe get to nevada. And somehow in 2-3 days we already have an apartment.\nI get back to school and the horrific 'study' sessions started again.\nThen after the apartment we get a house, my tenth birthday passes and it was fun.\nWe stay in that house for a while still having babysitters. But something was off. In one of the rooms. There was a circular mat with a pentagram on it. Crosses hanging on the wall. Cages with animals inside them.\nI didnt like that room\nBut this is when i finally get out of this siduation. I am currently still recovering. But now the place im in is better.\nOne day my mom starts to have an episode. Now im used to this. What normally happens is she gets very mad. And starts to disband from reality thinking that she can predict bombs. And see angels or demons... she takes it out on me alot and cusses and screams\nSo what happens is she starts to have an episode and so we go out and play a game called espionage i dont know why she called it that. But thats what it was. We would go out and drive around a freeway while i had to take pictures of peoples license plates if i didnt id be screamed at.\nAfter that game she then gets mad at our neighbors for some reason. But cannot find the keys to her car so she can drive over to scream at them. So after we get in the house she tells me to go to my room. I didnt hear that so i said what. She then proceeded to throw a glass stiner at me right beside my face.\nI run upstairs crying and eventually fall asleep\nthough at 3 am she wakes me up and yells in my face \"(MY NAME) GET UP, I HEARD A VOICE SAY GET OUT.

When I asked what exactly she did wrong, she told me she didn't know, but that he also \"made me get on my hands and knees and sweep with a tiny childs broom for the whole upstairs\" Adding that it was mostly carpet. When I asked if he normally punished her like this she told me he normally just beat her up. I freaked out slightly, and asked if she could maybe call cps or the police, since beating a child is not okay, she told me \"It's fine, I'm used to it.\" She swore to me she wasn't being abused, after telling me she was fine for a few times, but I still didn't really believe her. I decided to let it go, and just chat about nicer things for a bit. Her punishment lasted \"till I can show respect\" but she gave me the home telephone number, for if I wanted to hear her voice. Calling rates being \u20ac1,25 per minute, I nicely asked if I could save it, for if it ever became necessary for something, she agreed, and gave me her last name, so I could save her in my contacts. After she suddenly stopped texting, I assumed her dad come home, since she told me she'd leave when he came. Now I hadn't heard from her a few days, and suddenly got a message, telling me it was her dad, that her privileges were taken away, and politely asking me never to contact her again (I should add that when he went into discord he probably saw an erotic roleplay going on.)

I'm not sure exactly what this is/if its even a problem and I'd love some outside opinion on it.\n\nBasically, he'd say little things early on in the relationship, probably what I wanted to hear, about others, but then later on it would be used against me or he'd go back on it in some negative way.

I get insecure that he looks at his exes nudes AND their instagrams etc\n\n\"Yeah but even though they send me this stuff it doesn't matter because THERE ARE NO FEELINGS THERE. So I don't really care. It doesn't affect me\"\n\n\"Ugh... okay /reluctant\"\n\nMonth 20: I send him nudes.

And I know that aint making sense.\n\nHe'd sometimes peg this down to \"change\" or whatever but it made me so obsessive. Because he wouldn't answer to it so I'd be sitting there, killing myself over how his stories don't add up and he was probably lying and he'll just shrug it off and get annoyed at me so i can't even call him out on it.\n\nIt's like, everything that gave me any sense of security, or any shaky trust I tried to keep up by his dodgy words, in the early phases has now broken down. I can't even tell whats what. Like, he would reassure me with \"I don't care\" and then when the same thing happened to me, he did care all of a sudden? Hello? KEEP YOUR STORIES CONSISTENT.

And that was why I was insecure. So he told me he didn't? But obviously he did? Because he's said the same to me? So he thinks that of them? So then he wants them? I'm the same?

Isolated and alone. Depressed and barely holding on. I am looking forward to meeting this kid and I\u2019m already a single mother of an amazing four year old who\u2019s excited to have a brother. I always hope the kid won\u2019t be like his father at all knowing full well he shares his blood and may have similarities but he\u2019ll be his own person... my child.\n\nThis narc had been pursuing me for 5 months before I gave in to him when i was immensely vulnerable. I knew he was no good and objectified women but I didn\u2019t know the full extent of narc abusive until I endured it and was later diagnosed as a victim of narcissistic abuse in a gestalt therapy group in an in patient program I ended up in after enduring the hell he put me through. \n\nI lost an ovary due to a freak emergency ovarian torsion and it took them so long to diagnose what was wrong in the er I nearly died, but I survived and was told I was likely infertile after this incident  and it really fucked me up. \n\nThis is when he started to amp up his pursuit of me and love bombed me heavily until I caved in. I kept reminding myself that if it seemed to good to be true than it probably wasn\u2019t authentic but still I let him control me, possess me, have his way with me.  After the love bombing He started to beat me sexually but it escalated rather quickly beyond the bedroom and without consent.  I was constantly covered in bruises. \n\nThen the emotional and psychological abuse set in and I couldn\u2019t figure it out at the time but it just hurt and made me feel powerless. \n\nAfter our two intense months he discards me saying you just weren\u2019t who I thought you were thus putting all the blame onto me as he feels nothing and moves on quickly as narcs do.  I\u2019m feeling twice the pain and shame... but I still have to face him...\n\nWe were both in the same comedy scene and I was a host for comedy nights and a bartender at a comedy club.  After we break up...I find out I\u2019m pregnant and he lost his shit. He wanted to completely control me if I decided to keep the baby but under the conditions he was going to do whatever he wanted. He wanted to pay nothing but considers that I should feel so lucky to carry his child and that he\u2019s willing to be part of the kids life on his terms. I knew this wasn\u2019t ok with me but I felt weak and scared awhile. He\u2019d come in to my job and Hoover over me. He\u2019d come behind the bar where he wasn\u2019t allowed when I was busy and literally corner me and pin me to the wall saying weird shit like you know how it is, implying he owned me.  He\u2019d bring friends in an mock me, tell me to get an abortion while I\u2019m running a bar alone, get women to buy him drinks, bring in various dates and say you know I\u2019m a single man with needs etc... I started to get suicidal and so depressed and he made fun of me for it publicly by performing a set about how suicide is stupid etc. I felt so trapped and scared.\n\nI ended up in an inpatient day program\nFor 5 weeks straight after I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. It helped me understand what was happening to me and also go no contact. They also made me quit my job stating I could never get better taking acute abuse and I had to be realistic that he wasn\u2019t going to go away or stop so I had to give up my work. I lost everything I had in the comedy community. \n\nWell anyway 4 months later I have nightmares regularly about him. I have to keep my pregnancy and birth a secret. I\u2019m so paranoid of how manipulating he is I even blocked an cut out any friends that know him.  I know he doesn\u2019t want paternity because he doesn\u2019t want to pay a dime but yet he doesn\u2019t want to seem or look like a deadbeat father because he considers himself a public figure(lol). I\u2019m terrified he\u2019ll try to find me or will pop back in my life at some point wanting some part of this kid who he will only view as an object as I believe him incapable of empathy or love....\n\nDo you think he will just stay away if I stay out of sight and out of mind? I hope people just forget about me being pregnant with his kid and him as a deadbeat because I want nothing from him.  This fear is paralyzing, but then again he may not even give a shit at all and will just pretend like we don\u2019t exist using some of that \u2018magic thinking\u2019 \n\nI just wish I had certainty to set myself free but I know I need to just be strong and present and deal with whatever comes my way and just keep my family safe. \n ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Its been a roller coaster of emotional abuse and \u201clove\u201d. The last several weeks have been bad. About every 5-7 days we have some kind of event where he is controlling or manipulative and I cant handle it well (crying, trying to stand up for myself, reasoning... all the things that I probably shouldn\u2019t be doing knowing he is abusive). I noticed something though today. \n\nLast night was horrendous and painful. I kept telling him that I needed love and compassion while he screamed at how I blame him for everything. He called me terrible names and I tell him it hurts... he screams \u201cblamer\u201d!!! He tells me that I need to change myself. I finally tell him that we should separate. I lock myself away and cry and fear what is going to happen next. I have no clue how I am going to leave. The next day I stay locked away. I cant be around someone who has treated me so cruelly but I cant really leave the house. He texts me. \n\nAnd here is the pattern: after huge blow outs where he uses manipulation, yelling, cussing and gaslighting to destroy me, the next day he is weirdly energetic and happy. He tells me \u201cI slept so well last night\u201d, \u201cI have so much energy today\u201d. Texting me like not a thing in the world is wrong. No amends, no apologies, no hint of feeling bad that our relationship might be dead. I can hear him laughing and talking to ppl on the phone. I have only ever been so bold to stand up and say we should separate one other time and he apologized and said he would fix it and I believed him. \n\nI totally get that he doesn\u2019t think i will leave. But the happiness after such pain and drama baffles me. Its like I had an encounter with a succubus and all my pain and fear was used to give him strength and peace. This has happened on so many occasions. I am left crying and he is having a blast. Is that almost sociopathic? He definitely has a very limited amount of empathy.\n\nWhat does this do for him? As a side note, we talked about how I find it disturbing (about a year or more ago) he says his ex wife used to do the same to him and he hated it. Sooooo why do it to me? He says SHE was a sociopath and he hated his life and wanted to drown in alcohol from her treatment....  so now its time to dish it out? This is so confusing. ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

A report about a young child of 7 who was forced to carry a 44 pound log as punishment for not learning his bible verses, died at the hands of his parents.  \n\n\nAnd it reminded me of my past, of my own abuse... and while it's not something I exactly hide, it's not something I share often... and maybe, it's time for me to talk about it again. The problem is things are hazy in a way... I guess time does that huh? Where memories that were once razor sharp, dull over time? Still the details are there, the memories and the hurt are still there, even now that I'm 34, but I have no doubt on the pain this instance has caused me over the years.  \n\n\nI was born in Southern California, a small town just west of the Colorado River, you could drive into Arizona with little issue over a large bridge and state crossing checkpoint. The town is mostly dust and farmland... and I was lucky enough to live a relatively good life up until this point. I was a kid, I did kid things, ya know. My mother and I lived with my grandparents, her parents. And it was my mother's desire to get away from her mother, that really snowballed everything.  \n\n\nI grew up adoring my grandmother, she was always there for me, and she often felt like more of my mother than my mom did... but this is all framing. There were abuses prior... I grew up in a household where spanking was the norm... I also was diagnosed with ADHD at 5 years old... and a kid with ADHD isn't easy, even on parents prepped for such a thing... my mom wasn't, and neither was my grandmother, but they made it work the best they could...  \n\n\nThen, when I was about 8, my mother decided she'd had enough of living under my grandmother's roof. She was dating a guy, prior MP in the Marine Corps during Desert Storm. Tall 6'3\" Handsome, solid job with the state correctional facility as a correctional officer \\[for those who don't speak california political bullshit, he was a prison guard.\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe moved out of my grandparents place, then and moved into a small trailer for about half a year till she married him... by 95 or so, we were living with him in a new home, in a lovely suburb, nice house, big yard... the American dream to all outside viewers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen the troubles started, a year of literal hell. combined with my medication screwing with me, my attitude was all over the place... I was a young kid, who's world was being turned upside down by a new guy in my mother's life. And my mother... my mother was all too happy to hand over \"punishment duties\" to him. It started off small, but difficult things... forcing me to eat canned spinach that they seemed to serve with damned near every meal \\[I hate the taste, still do\\] standing with my nose against the wall unable to move while my favorite TV show was on... things like this. but I was still rebellious at the time,my schooling was slipping, and I rarely did my homework.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis of course, only reinforced to them, that they needed to punish me harder... in came the back yard... we had a nice, large backyard, southern california, desert area... not much greenery, but lots of space, and rocks, and dirt... And this, was my hell. Pulling weeds that I could barely get my hands around the stalks of... shoveling gravel from one pile to another, then told to put it back where I had shoveled it from prior... same with cinder blocks and bricks. The absolute bane of my existence though, was the log. a large, probably 8 - 10 foot wooden log around the size you'd expect for a street pole... that he'd make me turn end over end. I once busted my lip when it bounced up and smacked me in the face. He laughed.  \n\n\nNovember of that year was, in a way a god-send... despite the wound I suffered. During Vetran's day of that year, while hanging out with a friend, I was in a pellet gun misfire incident, my friend shot me in the crotch. I spent 3 months in recovery, and things were okay... until a couple of weeks after I recovered.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn January, just before my birthday... shit hit the fan. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd refused to do my homework yet again, and my step father had enough... the punishment began around 6pm, right after dinner... he had me doing flat foot jumps... he'd hold his hand about 3 foot off the ground, and tell me if I could flat foot jump that high, he'd let me stop... I was 9... and just recovered from a groin injury, there was no way I was making that jump, but it didn't stop me from trying my hardest... then came jumping jacks... until my arms didn't even want to lift... from there, he drug me outside, and to the log. This is where things get hazy for me... I remember turning that log over and over, end over end, I remember crying, yelling, asking him to stop, but he wouldn't... then, he grabbed me by the arm and drug me through the dirt... the police took photos of the scratches the next day... I don't remember that, and I barely remember him slapping the side of my face, but there are pictures of the handprint he left...  \n\n\nI remember, just before I went back in, I remember watching my mother, looking through the window at me, I begged her to help me, BEGGED her to help me, and she simply turned around, and walked away... that's what I remember most, is seeing my mother, the one person in ALL of this, that I thought might be willing to help, ignore me. I think everything ended around 8 or 10 pm, it's hard to guage time when you're being tortured I guess. I went inside, to my room, and passed out.  \n\n\nI had a routine, one my stepfather had given me, at this point... Wake up, shower, dress, ready for school in the morning. wash your hair, then your body, then your crotch and ass in that order. I remember waking up the next morning, and just, like a robot doing these things... I don't even remember seeing the bruises he left on my face... or feeling the scratches on my back that morning... I was just, doing what I was programmed to do. After waking up and getting ready around 5am, my mother, who was leaving for work, told me that I was to stay home that day, that I had a doctors appointment. I remember agreeing, then going to play the Sega Saturn I was bought due to being shot... It was while I was playing Clockwork Knight a bit that I remember thinking \"You know what, fuck this, I'm going to school, my stepfather can come pick me up if I have an appointment.\"  \n\n\nThis thinking, is what saved my life I think... I think that day, that decision, saved me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met up with a friend, a neighbor that morning, to walk to school with him like I always did, school was about 2 blocks from my place... and I remember him asking \"Won't your old man be pissed if you're gone.\" And I remember looking at him and saying. \"If he does, what's he going to do to me that he hasn't already?\"  I was fucking 9 years old, and saying this to my best friend at the time. My other friend, who's father worked with mine, said he could never do what I was doing, because his old man would beat the shit out of him.  \n\n\nMy two best friends in the world, wouldn't even help me... it wasn't until I got to school, that my cousin pulled me aside while we were waiting for classes to start. He asked me if I had even seen my face that morning. Now, remember, I'd gotten up, cleaned myself, brushed my teeth, combed my hair, the whole morning routine. I didn't notice anything. He pulled me into the bathroom and pointed out my black eye, the mark on my face, the whole bit.  \n\n\nWe went to the office... and CPS was called... it went so far as my stepfather showing up at the school, causing a lockdown... some of the kids said he came to my classroom, looking through the windows, and that they were flipping him off... I don't know, I can't confirm that, I was hidden deep in the office, in the copy room... with my cousin, not knowing what was happening.  \n\n\nMy mother and father were never charged with anything, and I was taken from my parents and placed with my grandparents. Other abuses happened after, but by others... I was sexually abused by a neighbor, but it was mutual, despite being only 10, I saw this neighbor as my boyfriend at the time and didn't think about it... but it has impacted my life... all of it has.  \n\n\nI'm 34 now... this was over two decades ago... I went looking around the net... to see if there was any information about what had happened. I haven't found anything, from what I understand, they served a short stint in \"anger management\" courses... I was ordered to live with my father without me even ever seeing a judge \\[which never happened because my biological father didn't want me, and never signed over rights to my grandmother, which caused further problems for me down the line.\\]   \n\n\nMaybe it's because it was a tiny town, maybe it's because it was the early/mid 90's... I don't know, but I felt the need to get my story out there... to just, put it out there. I'll probably post this multiple places, I don't really know what else to do... but right now, I know that I need this story out there.  \n\n\nI want to say I'm over it, but I don't think so... what happened back then, shaped who I am now... I'll never know the person I could have been if that year of hell had never happened... and I feel robbed because of that.  \n\n\nAnd I know, other's have it far worse than I did, I spent a year with that, some of my cousins, spent YEARS going through similar and arguably worse abuses due to their own step parents... but I need my story out there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you, for reading, if you have... and know, you're not alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-FlashFrame.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He put up his phone and we climbed to the top of the stairs. He had to fight off the first few men to get a weapon for us. But he did. Then we were both fighting. Not very well, but we were trying.

It makes me feel WORTHLESS that he hasn't tried to hoover AT ALL. It doesn't matter how I'll respond. I never want him back ever again. But what if he NEVER hoovers? How will I deal with this? Then it will be true. He never saw my worth as a woman. He can resist my love, my supply, sex, etc., no problem at all.\n\nI have read story after story about hoovers. I am an empathetic, nurturing soul and he doesn't think there is any supply worth coming back for? There was no apparent narc injury, no argument, just us saying we'll try being friends for awhile. Towards the end, he was cold and distant and was barely calling at all. I called him once and he was like a cold acquaintance. And then he ghosted completely. But I never called him again. I had told him beforehand to date who he wants after we said we'd be friends, because I enjoyed having him in my life, so he knows he'd always have a shoulder, empathetic ear, hot meal.\n\nWe dated two years on and off and he wanted to stop sex altogether early on (9 months in) into the dating. Just wanted regular bj\"s. Even though he was very sexually alive when I.met him, and continued to emanate strong sexuality just didnt want it with me.\n\nSo he didn't hoover, is not interested in conversations with me, my yummy cooking or anything. How can I feel he ever enjoyed any type of \"supply\" I offered. Really? There's nothing he would come back for? I am deeply distressed over this and no amount of my own brainwashing is changing this. The part that is the most hurtful is the sexual part. After it tapered off, he never wanted it again.

I know a few of my friends do as well. It's been nice to have other people I can occasionally talk to about things, but I kind of want more. I came across a website that runs a recovery support group (think A. A. but for childhood trauma survivors), there isn't one close to me but they offer all of the supplies for starting your own meetings. \n\nThis is something I would love to do and I would enjoy doing, but I'm not confident that I could successfully start a group on my own. I have friends who are also survivors, but I'm not certain that any of them would actually be interested in participating in something like this. Trauma is a very sensitive issue and most people aren't in a place where they would feel comfortable being involved in something potentially triggering.\n\nSo my question is, is it worth it? Are there people out there beside myself that would actually want to be a part of something like this? If you lived somewhere with a support group live this, would you consider it? Any sort of feedback or input would be greatly appreciated. I'll probably post this to a few other relevant subs as well. \n\nThe website in question: http://www.ascasupport.org", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

My therapist confirmed this and says I\u2019ve been suffering trauma. I also have depression and anxiety. I\u2019ve gotten a lot better and am in a new better relationship now. \n\nHowever, if we ever argue, I get extremely confused. Because of the gaslighting and recovery from it, I\u2019ve struggled to trust my own memory and instincts. My memory is usually alright but during conflict my brain can\u2019t seem to remember things correctly or won\u2019t recall memories. This makes me extremely frustrated since it becomes harder to convince people what I mean, and this was very hard when telling people I had an abusive relationship as I blocked out many of the memories and couldn\u2019t recall them on the spot. As a result I get really confused during arguments because I don\u2019t quite know what I mean to say- I just know how I feel with nothing to back me up.\n\nThen, I struggle to distinguish when things are wrong. If my boyfriend says something to me that makes me feel weird, I usually can\u2019t identify why, and if I realize it\u2019s something bad, I don\u2019t know how to react. It\u2019s a little difficult to explain as I\u2019m typing this on the spot. If I argue with someone, I try my best to be logical and straightforward as possible to avoid gaslighting. I can\u2019t quite distinguish my own feelings or explain them, so I end up saying much less than the other person, and I always lose arguments bc I can\u2019t articulate how I feel as well as the other person. I also can\u2019t help but feel like people are trying to manipulate or hurt me, so I sometimes freak out when people disagree with me, making me extremely stubborn (to try and deter potential gaslighting). \n\nTLDR: Generally, I just shut down and can\u2019t respond correctly or reasonably to an argument or confrontation due to my trauma that makes my memory worse and my feelings indistinguishable, and losing arguments through this makes me feel worse because I think I\u2019m wrong when I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not, I just can\u2019t explain it correctly.\n\nHow do I stay calm enough to allow my memory to work properly? How can I identify when someone is using manipulative language or fallacies vs me just freaking out bc of anxiety? How can I identify why I feel so off or put it into words? \nAnd above all, is this normal and something that can be fixed? Could I get some support or reassurance? thank you!

He essentially harassed both of them, in particular Joey, whom he threatened by saying he would tell his mother he'd done heroin if he didn't tell him the truth.  He used this method not only to fact check me, but to validate things he would say like that I'm a liar and a manipulator, saying Paul and Joey both told him they wanted to get rid of me because of my lies and manipulations.  Paul may or may not have said that, but Joey did not. My ex maintained that Joey told him we'd dated at some point, which was not true, both because it never happened and because Joey confirmed he never said that. When I spoke to Paul he confirmed my ex's assertion that Paul was going to come visit me and I was obviously going to cheat on him was false.\n\nGaslighting / Verbal Abuse:\n\nVirtually every time my ex and I had an argument, he would say I'm crazy, sick, psychopathic, sociopathic, narcissistic, a liar, and a manipulator.  The worst of these accusations was the assertion that because I had once tied him to my bed and, as a joke, grabbed a pair of scissors, that I was a psychopath who would wind up killing someone and blaming them for it. In truth, I thought it would be funny, and when I noticed he was not amused in the least, I put them away.\n\nAdditionally, when we fought he would tell me no one would ever want to be with someone as crazy as me. He'd tell me I'd never amount to anything, never hold a job, never get out of my parent's house. He'd tell me he was going to find someone sane that he can build a life with.\n\nEmotional Blackmail:\n\nAlmost every time we fought, he would break up with me, and he used our relationship as leverage to get what he wanted.\n\nSabotage/ Character Assassination / Slander\n\nAfter he broke up with me most recently was when I spoke to Paul and Joey and realized my ex had lied about things they'd said to manipulate my perceptions of them and to validate his assertions.  As such, I didn't try to contact him.  We played a mobile game together, and he went on an app with people we play with and told 300+ people that I'm a junkie, a liar, a manipulator, a cheater, a sociopath, a psychopath, etc. He even included screen shots to try to validate his claim that I'd cheated on him.\n\nA few days later, he told my parents that I'm a junkie and he thinks I'm using and that they should know, and that I was harassing him, even though I hadn't contacted him for days (probably precisely because I hadn't contacted him in days). He did his best to exude charm along with the lie, \"Thank you for welcoming me into your house...\" etc. It is likely he told this and I don't know what else to any number of our mutual acquaintances, but I haven't asked anyone because I don't want it to get back to my ex, who would likely feel he had to spread more rumors in retaliation.\n\nNegative Contrasting / Projection:\n\nThroughout the relationship, he maintained that he was a victim of my abuse. That I was a narcissist, psychopath, sociopath, etc. The only reason I even started to think he might in fact be an abusive narcissist was because he sent me a link to an article about them while telling me that I am one. He went as far as contacting me yesterday through the game we played to tell me that he still cares about me, and that he doesn't want to speak to me right now, but he still sees a potential future for us if only I would go to therapy to work through my abusive tendencies.\n\nScattered Thoughts:\n\nMy ex has told me his mother is an abusive narcissist/liar/manipulator.  His parents were both psychiatrists and they apparently used their professions to turn him into a \"science experiment\". He said he's been in every psych ward within 120 miles, but released from each because they couldn't find anything wrong with him. He claimed his parents used to use the police to \"parent\" him by lying to them about things he'd done, and as a result he started middle school in juvie. He also went to 4 different boarding schools designed for troubled kids, because he kept getting kicked out. I know some of this is accurate, though I'm not sure what if anything might be skewed. This was in part why I was initially willing to overlook his behavior, and I've seen certain articles detailing that a person with a history like this is more likely to develop narcissistic traits, which is why I feel it is relevant to note.\n\nHaving been a close friend for years, my ex knew I'd dated/lived with a guy I believed to be a sociopath. It's possible he thought I'd be an easy target because I was pre-conditioned to abuse, including having been strangled multiple times.\n\nMy ex maintained that all of his most recent exes were abusive, and that the most recent one was so crazy she'd tried to break her own arm so she could claim he'd done it.  He also said that she'd cheated on him throughout the entirety of their relationship on and off with the same person, and that he'd been unable to eat for weeks because of it. Seemed a little odd that I'd told him that was exactly what happened with the guy I thought might be a sociopath.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI could go on forever, but half a novel seems long enough. Please share your thoughts on the matter, if you'd like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I love his kids and until now, that has been the main prevention from breaking the secrecy I\u2019ve been complicit in for all of this time.\n\nBut i realised that it is the secrecy that protects abusers. They use innocent others as their shield, to protect against the consequences of their actions. \nI am past the point of wanting revenge, and in fact I still don\u2019t feel like I want anything bad to happen to my ex or anything that would hurt the children. I am reassured by the fact that they have a good mother, and they mainly live with her. And I do want to do the right thing. I will tell of what I\u2019ve been through and then it is out of my hands and the law will take its course. His remorselessness and denial has convinced me that this is the right thing to do. It may protect someone else. It may make him wake up to reality. It may be futile, but I want to try. I don\u2019t feel strong, and I\u2019m not, but if I don\u2019t do this, I will regret it and I will never respect myself.\n\nI have reported it to the police and I am expecting to give my full statement very soon. \nI did not research extensively what is involved because I did not want to put myself off. I know it will be exposing for me and I know that it may be difficult to be believed. I hope that the therapist who worked with us (a token gesture from him to pretend he would change) can testify that he admitted to repeatedly attacking me, that one time I even had to go to hospital and that the physical abuse was severe and that he admitted to it, he just didn\u2019t think it was wrong enough to stop. I hope that my friend who offered me a safehouse and witnessed my suffering many times, and who was the only person who knew for a long time will be taken into account as evidence. I hope my friends who took me in in London when i fled from a hotel will be believed as well. And I hope that my pictures of one of the grevious injuries I suffered will help.\n\nIn truth, I fear that it can be turned against me somehow. But I probably have nothing to lose. I think my friends will stand by me.\nI am afraid for my safety because he knows where I live and we are in the same town. For him, this is ultimate loss of control and I don\u2019t know how he will react. But I hope the people I\u2019ve now told, who believe me and know that I am reporting it will act as my safety net because if anything were to happen to me now, he would be taking a huge risk and he would not be able to get away with it or keep it a secret and if I am able to record it and report it, I will. I hope that keeps me safe.\n\nIf anyone in the UK has taken this route, or wanted to and knows what I\u2019ve let myself in for, I am ready to hear it now. I have started the process and I am ready. I suppose I mainly want to hear positive stories and legal advice. I already know of the struggle of victims getting justice for things that aren\u2019t happening right this second and aren\u2019t easy to prove. Well, from the media anyway.\n\nI also want to offer encouragement to anyone thinking about leaving. It\u2019s hard, it is the fucking pits. But it\u2019s better than what you\u2019re living now - it has more hope and more friendship and potential than you can imagine right now. If you don\u2019t have good people to go to, there are good charities everywhere. I have learned that no matter how unique you think you and your situation is, there are so many more people than you could possibly imagine going through something extremely similar. \n", "subreddit": "abuse"}

This is when he started being \u201cunsure\u201d of his feelings for me\n\nThen, he started saying he was scared of what I would do if He tried to leave me\n\nI will admit, I\u2019ve messed up in the past. I used to blow up his phone at the silent treatment, go mental. At one point I started posting on his friends instagrams to get hold of him after I found out some messed up stuff. I am NOT proud of this. I really should not have done that and I regret it. It was a long time ago and I have never come near that level of crazy again. I don\u2019t even recognise who I became. This was a few years ago. \n\nAnyway, he started saying \u201cI feel like I can\u2019t leave you because I\u2019m scared you\u2019ll do that again\u201d. It was awful. I felt like a monster. I assured him I wouldn\u2019t. Then he told me to leave him alone and not message him over the holidays. I barely messaged him. And he was the one who had come back to me. \n\nSo I did, just a message over Christmas. And we had a brief conversation. No, it wasn\u2019t nice. We were arguing. But it was what it was. I was distraught. He did something to me that I could call the police about and in a fit of upset I kind of threatened I would. But he spoke to me and I didn\u2019t. He agreed to discuss it after the holidays. It was okay. . And then we started talking again a week after that. It was HIM that suggested we could work things out. \n\nIN my head we were broken up. But he suggested we could work so we started trying again. But then he was acting like he was only speaking to me out of force. And that I \u201cwouldn\u2019t allow him to leave\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t get it. He didn\u2019t try to stop responding, or block, or even say clearly he wanted to break up. But maybe he was genuinely scared? Maybe i was being really manipulative with the police thing? I was honestly just upset and wanted to do something about it all but that was wrong. \n\nEven though I\u2019m so much better. But I seriously can\u2019t believe that. Me having two conversations with you is \u201cnot letting you leave\u201d?? How?\n\nAnd he kept saying \u201cyeah I\u2019ve just accepted you won\u2019t let me leave you\u201d. What?! You\u2019ve left me like 7 or 8 times in the last 2 years alone?? How can you even say that. Sure, I used to message you repeatedly and try and get you back but not this time? I stayed quiet. \n\nHe also said \u201cI\u2019m not allowed to leave\u201d. I don\u2019t feel like he even tried?! Did he tell me we were broken up, no. Am I that messed up? He\u2019s left me so many times. I can\u2019t stop someone from leaving me. I can fight sure, but I\u2019ve never stopped it. Apparently fighting is now not allowing him to break up with me\n\nDidn\u2019t even realise that was a thing. He\u2019s an adult. Of course he could leave. I can be upset then can\u2019t I?\n\nI\u2019m in a different country. I don\u2019t know anything about him. All it would take would be blocking my number. And I didn\u2019t realise just contacting him was forcing him to be in a relationship?! We spoke once a week\n\nI just feel awful. Like I must be the most awful person for him to feel scared to leave. You know who feels scared to leave? People being abused. But I just don\u2019t see how it makes sense. \n\nHow do I know he wasn\u2019t just talking to me out of fear and obligation and guilt? He has discarded me now (I didn\u2019t send a single text after that, sure I lost all my dignity begging him not to but) but he acted like he was the victim. \n\nI\u2019m so confused.

Language is simply used as a tool for deception, manipulation, and story telling. Everything they do is for show, or only meant in the moment. That's why everything around them seems so chaotic and confusing. There isn't any consistency or reliability. In order to be able to do what they want, whenever they want it and however they want it, with whomever they want it, ie ultimate freedom, they also have to compartmentalize their lives.\n\nOh sure, in the beginning they fake closeness and openness with you. They actually temporarily make you a priority. The narcissist may even use you as a confidant, but a narcissist is always juggling various sources of narcissistic supply (attention) simultaneously. There is an extremely scheming quality to the evaluation of all narcissistic supply.\n\nAs Sam Vaknin says:\n\nThe narcissist receives a host of narcissistic stimuli..... messages from people who are willing to provide the narcissist with Narcissistic Supply. But mere readiness is not sufficient.\n\nThe narcissist now faces the daunting task of evaluating the potential content, quality, and extent of Narcissistic Supply each and every one of the potential collaborators has to offer. He does so by rating each one of them. The stimulus with the highest rating is, naturally, selected. It represents \"the best value for money\", the most cost/reward efficient proposition.\n\nThe narcissist immediately over-values and idealises this source. It is the narcissistic equivalent of getting emotionally involved. The narcissist \"bonds\" with the new source. The narcissist feels attracted, interested, curious, magically rewarded, reawakened.\n\nJust as quickly, the narcissist will lose interest and no longer invest energy, and you now become devalued to secondary supply. Everything else becomes more important than you. The narcissist becomes bored, devoid of energy, absolutely uninterested, and you are now low priority. They need to conserve their energies for cultivating newer, ever-changing supply sources. Sure, you may still experience mini-cycles of approach-avoidance, just enough to keep you hooked.\n\nSuddenly, you are no longer in the loop as far as their life is concerned. It feels like they keep a huge part of their life secret from you. In fact they start to separate you from everything else they are doing in their life. The only time you still connect with them is in their spare time or when you are on vacation with them, when they have nothing else to do. You are literally the proverbial afterthought. When you are in one of the pro-longed avoidance phases, it is often laced with emotional abuse, especially when you try to include yourself in their life.\n\nYou begin to realize that their entire life is compartmentalized. Your adult children never met his adult children. The narcissist may also suddenly change to a different gym than the one you both went to. He is absolutely not interested in blending into your life, nor does he really want you to blend into his life. With the narcissist, the relationship is always one foot in and one foot out. That's why they really prefer long distance relationships, that require limited focus, and they can keep the \"relationship\" for entertainment only.\n\nYou start to see him as the chameleon he really is. He morphs into whatever he needs to be depending on the audience. He re-arranges his life all the time, and though a rigid personality, his personas are ever-changing, depending on which show he needs to perform in. Yet he does this so naturally that he is mistaken for being genuine. Though he keeps telling you that you've changed, it is he who has changed dramatically.\n\nAs Sam Vaknin observes:\n\nMany narcissists don't feel responsible for their actions. They believe that they are victims of injustice, bias, prejudice, and discrimination. This is because they are shape-shifters and actors. The narcissist is not one person - but two. The True Self is as good as dead and buried. The False Self changes so often in reaction to life's circumstances that the narcissist has no sense of personal continuity.\n\nNarcissist may move in with you, when you want the relationship to go to the next level. However, beware that the move-in is merely for show, as he may be spending just as much time away from you as before, and sneakily hopes his abusive behavior will get him kicked out in short notice, so he can blame \"it not working out\" on you.\n\nYour supposed relationship seems as fickle as a teenage love affair. Their immaturity is most evident in the friends they choose. You will find that they prefer much younger friends. In fact, the preference is for friends who are of the same generation as their own children. Not only are these \"friends\" easier to manipulate, because they look up to him, but it gives him a sense of eternal youth, and limitless possibilities.\n\nThe narcissist so wants to be babied, that they may even \"adopt\" a young family, to feel like they are part of that family by proxy. That way the narcissist can have all the joy and entertainment of a family, and their undivided attention, without having any responsibilities. Likewise narcissists thrive on the attention showered on them by the married partner of their friend, without having to invest in any real relationship themselves.\n\nNot only is their constant over-the-top attention to others very disconcerting, you will never get any undivided attention from your narcissistic love partner, since they need to keep themselves 100% available to their various sources of narcissistic supply. Plans they make with you will be cancelled, when something better comes up. Their un-predictability is very confusing, and you never know where you stand in the \"relationship.\"\n\nIt's only afterwards that you realize the full extent of their different personas that are mutable to different environments. There is no real person behind the many fa\u00e7ades. You feel relieved that it wasn't you that caused the relationship to deteriorate, it was inevitable with a narcissist. It cannot be said often enough, that they are truly incapable of real love. They just toy around with the pretense of love, since they want all the benefits but none of the investment.\n\nIt's far more than just emotional unavailability, it's a cunning game they play to keep themselves surrounded by an adoring entourage, because they cannot be alone. Whenever they are temporarily low on narcissistic supply they are immersed in depression and become a hermit.\n\nAnd when you look back on their work history you can see that even their work partnerships disintegrate easily and regularly.\n\nSo don't be fooled by the lines they feed you, like \"I never thought I'd meet a woman that I'd like to spend the rest of my life with,\" or the moving target of 2-3 years they keep using to get their plans together, so they supposedly can finally be available to you. They really WILL end up a mere figment of your own imagination, rather than a real person you can plan a future with.\n\nUltimately the narcissist is only interested in money and power.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

How do they craft their attacks to be so effective? But if you think about it, if you really wanted to hurt someone, you know how to do it.

You wouldn't do it because it would hurt somebody, possibly destroy them, and you don't want to do anything like that to another person. You also simply don't think that way. You don't go around making note of other people's insecurities so that you have ammo to use against those people later. You don't take pleasure in making someone else feel bad.\n\nWith narcissists though, all bets are off. They see an opportunity to hurt you, and they take it.

She snapped, and I defended myself, which is apparently what narcs do. A few days ago, I found out everything about this narc stuff, and I sent her a long message, saying that she might be a narc, gave my evidence for that, said sorry for the things I actually DID wrong, and said I'd block her everywhere 'till Monday (yesterday), because I thought she had the right to answer and say goodbye too.\n\nWhat I didn't expect was that she'd say sorry. She didn't beg on her knees like I'd expect from a narc, but she seemed genuinely sorry for what she did. She said she loved me, even though she had told me earlier that she didn't, that it was fake. Apparently she hated to admit it after 'what I had done'. She has a new supply, but he's two years younger than us (like, damn, 16) and she doesn't really know if she really likes him or not. I told her to make a decision about that if she wants any chance of keeping me here. \n\nI genuinely don't know what to do, though. My original plan was to let her answer on Monday and then block her again, but now that we've been talking positively for a day, it feels awful and rude to block her again.

Part of my reasoning is because I\u2019ve realized this person I loved so much didn\u2019t ever love me and treated me terribly (in ways that could be categorized as emotionally/mentally abusive), and the other part is because I still miss her so much and am mourning the fact that she isn\u2019t in my life anymore (because she just dropped me spontaneously and which makes me feel so ridiculous).\n\nIn recent months, I\u2019ve reflected on my best friend and college roommate of 3 1/2 years\u2019 behavior throughout our entire friendship. The first year-ish was a dream of her being kind and complimentary and always open to listening to my problems (though they always turned to her talking about her OWN problems, which were always similar but somehow bigger and more important than mine). She\u2019d push me to tell her private information under the guise that she was \u201ctrying to help [me].\u201d Then she got upset when I got involved in music (her major, not mine) and was receiving compliments from other music students and professors in the department.\n\nThen things got even worse from there. She and I both wanted to audition for a solo in our choir, and she convinced me not to because it\u2019d be \u201cperfect\u201d for her; when I caved and auditioned and got it, she stormed out of rehearsal, went back to our room, self-harmed, and then confronted me with her injury later that night and said it was proof of what a terrible friend I am. She spent the remainder of the school year coming up to me at least once a week to shove the healing wound/scar into my face to show me \u201chow it looks now\u201d (though interestingly, she never showed me how any of her other self-harm scars were healing). She\u2019d come to theatre productions I was in with other friends, praise the other friends and give them gifts and flowers, and then give me a one word response to my performance. \n\nShe outed me (I\u2019m bisexual and was secretly dating a woman for 2 years at the time) to some of my closest friends at university, and she\u2019d point blank tell me later, \u201cI told so-and-so you\u2019re gay and dating a woman. They reacted fine, so it isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d Then she\u2019d have the audacity to get angry at me when I got upset. She knew I had been trying to figure out how and when to come out to those people, and she took that opportunity from me because then she\u2019d be directly involved in the \u201cdrama\u201d of my being outed and that person\u2019s shock.\n\nShe constantly vied for attention from my friends (ones she only knew because they were my friends) and especially my boyfriend, and she\u2019d tell me how they confided in her about things they\u2019d never told me about (which never actually happened) and made \u201cjokes\u201d about how they liked her more than they liked me. She was also convinced every guy was in love with her and bragged about it constantly and would even tell me how she could tell my boyfriend was obviously attracted to her and flirted with her.\n\nOur senior year, she lied about being raped (which is a whole \u2018nother long story but happened because the guy she was sleeping with didn\u2019t want a serious relationship with her), and despite knowing that I have trauma from sexual abuse that means I can\u2019t talk about sexual abuse without getting severely anxious and depressed, she would tell me, \u201cYou need to sit here with me and listen to me talk about my rape, or I\u2019ll hurt myself.\u201d\n\nAnd despite all of this, I still occasionally miss her and feel obligated to respond to her texts and messages. Sometimes I can snap myself out of it once I realize all of her texts and snapchats are her fishing for compliments or attention, but most of the time, I bite because it makes me feel awful to just ignore a text from someone I once loved so fiercely.\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to break out of this cycle because she painted this picture of herself at university as the most empathetic person you\u2019ll ever meet (to the point where she\u2019d brag that she could \u201csense\u201d what you were feeling from miles away and could see your auras); it\u2019s hard to fully realize that she isn\u2019t the person she made herself out to be. \n\nAnyone have any advice on how to break this habit of always being there for her and wanting to still be a good friend to her?? I feel so terrible every time I ignore her, and I don\u2019t know how to stop feeling that way. Furthermore, how do I handle the fact that we still have a lot of friends (and very close friends) in common?

Luckily me and my father realised this from a very young age so we managed to build an emotional barrier. \nRemember that these people are sadistic and get pleasure by inflicting pain. Seeing you down makes them feel significant and powerful. Therefore provoking them is the worst thing you can do. Remember, they always victim blame AND try to make themselves the victim. These people internally feel inferior, so they will seek to be superior at whatever cost. \nPlease just cut the person out of your life.

He said he felt like a \"bad friend\" since he had these feelings for me. Yet I feel so deeply and strongly about him. What I notice with the relationship/friendship I have with him, it is natural and we complement each other rather than this idea of completing one another and soulmates and all that super intense infatuation crap. \n\nI'm okay with exploring these feelings with him because primarily we don't live nearby. We live multiple states away so physically we've yet to really be in the same place at the same time especially since expressing how we feel for each other.

It is very hard to keep it short, I hope people will read this.   \n\n\nI've recently ended the friendship with my best friend of 7-8 years. It started because of an argument about something pretty ridiculous that made me realize that the friendship wasn't healthy. I was argueing with my best friend (Let's call him Azra) for hours because I made a sexual joke with my boyfriend (which I do with everyone) and Azra claiming that it was an intimacy he was not comfortable with. I was not comfortable with him sexualizing our relationship and tried to tell him that and that our joke was not sexual flirting. We argued about this for hours where I was anxious, sweaty and exhausted. That made me realize that the friendship wasn't healthy.  \nFor some context, my dad has been emotionally abusive towards me (being annoyed or yelling whenever I made a mistake, not caring about me or whenever we argued and he \"apologized\" (which was rare) he'd always critizize what I could've done better, which messed me up greatly). Azra was my best and only friend for quite some time (we were friend for 7-8 years) but I've recently realized how much he is like my father.   \nFor the most ridiculous things, I'd get screamed at. I got screamed at that I was an asshole and told that he'd like to break my neck (In german it's more of a figure of speech) and he ripped my beanie off of my head, because I made an \"Ew Gryffinor\" comment about the color of his hat. The reason? He was pissed because we pressured him into buying a color he didn't like (we all wanted to get beanies, neither me nor my two friends remember wanting to get a different color which he insists upon). I was close to tears (something both of the other friends noticed knowing me for two days but Azra didn't) and later apologized, feeling like shit because I was mad at Azra. I really felt terrible because I was not able to see what I did wrong.   \nAzra has agression problems (he admits to that himself) and uses that as an excuse whenever I have a problem with him, telling me that I should know what person he is., That I should understand that he has agression problems. That that somehow makes it okay and not his fault. This messed me up pretty badly. I was telling myself that if I made my friend this upset that they were in the right, that what he did or whenever he screamed at me, it was okay, He gaslighted me pretty badly to, because whenever we remembered something differently, even when I had evidence to back it up differently, he'd insist that he was right.   \nNow, my problem is that I really only remember a few distinct situations where he was extremely shitty to me (mainly when we disagreed).So I'm just still asking myself if he really treated me that badly? Because we had great times too, where he was there when I needed a shoulder to cry on. I still have no idea and I still kind of blame myself for what happened, even questioning if the situations were really that terrible. I was shy and timid, maybe I should've stood uo to him because that could've prevented everything. I don't know if I can really blame him. If I can really blame him. Part of me thinks I'm being in the right, but a part of me thinks that I overreacted, I feel guilty for ending the friendship and hurting him (even though right now he's lying to my friends about me and doesn't really care that he hurt me). Could I have really expected him to know how he hurt me (I tried to confront him but I always got a mad reaction from him when we disagreed). These situations were so rare, is it really okay to label him as an abuser? Could I have prevented it? Should I have acted differently? I don't know if I should've understood him. I just really don't know. I don't know if telling him that he abused me was right, if I was being really truthful. Hell I'm scared that I might not remember shit accurately and am manipulating everyone else and not telling the full story, that I hurt my best friend and that he's in the right in justifying himself.

I can see how someone would think that, and I definitely know my mom isn't normal, but I really want to know what exactly wrong with her so I can deal with her bullshit better. Are there any professionals or just regular people out there who has had dealt with a confirmed narcissist? I don't know if I'm dealing with NPD, but like I said I can see why someone would think that. \n\nHere's what I've noticed about my mother: \n\n-She's never wrong in her mind and will turn the tables on you every time. Nothing is ever her fault.\n\n-Everyone is stupid/ugly/annoying/can't do anything right and she's one of the few competent people in the world.\n\n-She's extremely good at getting people to like her and side with her and will use those people to torment her target. The target was usually me.\n\n-She would prioritize friends over her family. It was to the point to where they'd treat us like dirt too. \n\n-She would put her boyfriends above all else. She had many of them and they were all scum bags, except maybe one. I went through all kinds of abuse with these men and was constantly being uprooted from home to home, school to school. My mom, of course, would justify their actions and now says she doesn't remember any of it.\n\nI can't be myself around this lady. At all. She tries to dictate everything. She's the hero or the victim in every situation. \n\nI've read up on the scapegoat/golden child dynamic and I think we had one. My mom never really did speak quite as badly to my sister as she did me and she definitely was more accommodating towards her and when my sister would blow her off she'd be a little nicer towards me, but that was always short lived. \n\nMy mom would always compliment my looks though. I suspect it was to butter me up because she knows I don't like my appearance. That's really the only \"nice\" thing she'd ever say. \n\nWhat am I dealing with? Does this sound like a narc? Or is it something else entirely? Bluh. I don't get it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Advice please :(", "author": "ChazzieMc", "self_text": "My partner (m35) and I (f31) have been together for coming up to 4 years, it has not been your typical relationship and has certainly had its highs and lows.\nWe were together for 9 months before he went to prison, he was there for 2 years and when he was released moved straight  in with me.\nNow we both knew it wouldn\u2019t be plain sailing but it\u2019s been tough and I don\u2019t know where to turn. As far as my family and friends are concerned, I\u2019m on cloud 9, happiest I\u2019ve ever been. I feel that if I were to admit what it actually going on they\u2019d make me leave. We are meant to be getting married in 8 weeks. I\u2019m embarrassed at my life right now and have avoided everyone I know so I don\u2019t have to lie and say how fantastic things are when inside I\u2019m dying.\nHis life before Prison was that of a typical single guy, work hard play hard. Lots of drinking, drugs, late nights, sleeping all day. Not having to answer to anyone. Not really \u2018friends\u2019 as such but a group of \u2018the guys\u2019 to get f-up with. We didn\u2019t live together at this point so it wasn\u2019t a huge problem.\nFast forward to now....\nWhile he was inside he realised that he was living an empty life and was so excited to start making plans for when he came home to me and my 2 children.\nI visited him every 2 weeks, wrote every other day and spoke on the phone constantly. I cut nights out short so I could be back in time to speak with him. He had a mobile and we\u2019d speak literally all evening. Great for him but didn\u2019t leave me much time but I knew he needed me. We were great, he was doing ok in there and although we had ups and downs we were strong. I knew if we could get through that we could get through anything. And I\u2019ve tried, I\u2019m trying but I just feel so stupid like I can\u2019t give up now. I can\u2019t afford to throw him out even if I wanted too.\nWhen he came home from prison he went for a night out with the one friend (who I thought was semi-ok) and it just went wrong. He got smashed, couldn\u2019t barely talk, didn\u2019t know where he was or how to get home. I heard girls in the back ground when he was saying there weren\u2019t. I had trust issues from before he went but wanted to start afresh when he came out. It wasn\u2019t the best start.\nAnother time I got in the car to leave from work (10pm), called him and he was drunk. I told him to leave if he was going to be pissed. He literally got in his car and left. He turned his phone off and I didn\u2019t hear a thing until 8am the next morning. I drove around for hours searching worrying he\u2019d crashed or been picked up by the police and put back inside. During this I called his mum as that was the obvious place he\u2019d be but she said she knew nothing. I found out the next day he called her on his way there and she let him in. I literally did.not.sleep. Why would someone be so cruel? She is a whole other story....\nHe has lied multiple times, I don\u2019t know why because they are never about anything major but he lies, he deletes messages, he says he\u2019s somewhere that he\u2019s not even though the place he is wouldn\u2019t be a problem. \nWe have had a few big arguments, when we do he goes so cold and this is where I\u2019m really struggling. He makes out as if things are my fault. The latest one being on Sunday, I told him I was worried about his spending and didn\u2019t think we now had enough to get through the month. We worked it out and I was right. He made out it was my fault for spoiling him since he\u2019s been home so he felt like he had to buy me stuff back. The argument escalated, we went to bed where he fell asleep straight away while I cried myself to sleep at how ridiculous things had got and not for the first time. I realised he wasn\u2019t asleep but couldn\u2019t be bothered to deal with it so just ignored me. The next day he tried to act like nothing had happened but when I wasn\u2019t ok with him he pretty much ignored me the entire day until he got back from work. I then apologised for upsetting him, for causing an argument etc which he accepted but said he was still so annoyed and stressed he needed to go out for beers and a smoke to have space from me. I begged him not too as I knew it would leave to more issues. I look back today and can\u2019t believe I\u2019m begging someone not to leave me. I\u2019m apologising for something I didn\u2019t do. This morning I googled emotional abuse and am worried things are going that way if not there already. I told him this and he said that maybe he should leave me then if he\u2019s treating me so bad. \nI don\u2019t know what to do, all I want is him to talk and show his emotions. I know this may be hard as he\u2019s had to hide them in prison but surely when your girlfriend is in pieces in-front if you that would cause you to soften a little? I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m asking, there is so much more that has happened, all similar-lies then I catch him and he goes cold on me and acts like he can\u2019t be bothered.\nDo I keep going with this and hope over times he\u2019ll soften back to how he was when he was inside or is this something more?\n", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I\u2019m talking serious stuff like guys all over her Facebook and wondering why I\u2019m insecure about our new \u2018dating\u2019 thing. Accusing me of projecting my insecurities onto them when actually she\u2019s making that a thing, I\u2019d tried to meet them so many times and of course I wasn\u2019t allowed, I\u2019m not well liked by them, you see. Getting really angry when I think she\u2019s seeing someone else despite her past. If I called her out on anything she would go ballistic and she was never like this before. I\u2019d hear all about the fun she was having, then when I said I had a good time somewhere she didn\u2019t want to hear it because she\u2019d had a \u2018shit night\u2019 and \u2018I just don\u2019t need to hear it\u2019. My personal favourite was when I was with my councillor (about her, she was unaware) and she was bombarding me with texts \u2018concerned about  my wellbeing\u2019 because I hadn\u2019t replied in about 3 hours, despite the evening before she didn\u2019t reply at all, she\u2019d messaged my friends and everything out of \u2018concern\u2019. I offered to then meet her if she was worried about me because I felt bad and she turned snotty with me. \n\nOk yeah, she was a nightmare to argue with most of the time. But we would always sort it out, I wouldn\u2019t have said we had a bad relationship up until the paragraph above. It was genuinely like she was a different person. Emotionally it was pretty traumatic and I battled myself everyday telling myself that I was struggling to adjust and confused/not coping, we lived together for 3 years, I carried her moms coffin, surely I must be being too sensitive? This can\u2019t be happening surely not? I\u2019d explain myself and my concerns during arguments during this time and I\u2019d be met with a glazed look, she just couldn\u2019t comprehend my viewpoint.\n\nSo eventually I got mostly sane and got out. Then was hoovered after a month or so (I allowed it purely based on now I was ok, not a wreck and could see clearly, knew that emotionally I wasn\u2019t a wreck anymore) and the same thing happened, or a prelude to the same thing, as soon as it did she was blocked and now we\u2019re 9 weeks or so NC. \n\nThis has turned into somewhat of a vent. But god, what was I dealing with?? I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve been for a while now though which is good. \n\n\nEdit: I allowed the hoover to give her the chance to prove me wrong about her.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

As I\u2019m adjusting to this new change, I have been not only remembering the good times, but also the bad times. And that has helped me from picking up the phone and calling him. \n\nI remember being pregnant for the first time and we got into a fight. I went to my parent\u2019s house to get away from him. He texted, called me, left voicemails, and emailed \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about you and your fucking child. Go get fucked by someone else, have an abortion and kill that child, I don\u2019t give a fuck\u201d. I was shocked, in disbelief that he would say such horrible things. And he didn\u2019t just do it once, not twice, but 5 times. His mom eventually got involved. She called me asking me to forgive him for what he has done, that he is very sorry. By then, a combination of a high risk pregnancy and trauma, i miscarried. I remember being in the hospital wanting to save my child, seeing all the blood and remembering his hateful words. It was traumatizing. Yet, I gave him another chance. \n\nAnother time when we were living together, he got upset, don\u2019t remember the reason, just that it was a big fight. He ended up kicking me out. That\u2019s his thing even till I walked out. I paid rent, some months I would even pay rent for the both us. And yet, when he was mad, he would always say, \u201cget the fuck out if you don\u2019t like it\u201d. I was so tired of hearing that, he knew I had no family in that city, and had no real place to go. But I was so tired of feeling like that place that I built to be my home was actually never mine. So, I left, and I stayed in the in the lobby of the school pretending to study. I showered I. The school gym. Why? Bc I didn\u2019t want others to know what happened. I was embarrassed. Eventually I stayed on the couch of friend\u2019s place. \n\nAnother time we were pregnant again. In another moment of rage, he again went crazy. Again, he kicked me out WHILE I WAS PREGNANT!!!!  Had no care. Sent me an email saying he was \u201cwashing his hands from me and that seed, get an abortion, that\u2019s the best thing for you\u201d. Then later was was like \u201cI hate you and your child, now I\u2019m trap\u201d then \u201cI will love my child but stay away from you\u201d i asked him to leave me at peace. That arguing was not good for the child or me. I begged him. I just re-read the emails and I was begging him to hold his tongue and don\u2019t say anything hurt again. I begged him. But the more I did, he played the victim, saying how I was a worthless bitch trying to keep him from his child. Omg!!!! How!!! Me kicked me out, he wrote the stuff about washing his hands from us and to have an abortion. I just wanted peace. I didn\u2019t want to fight. And I told him that and I begged him. \n\nAnd then the cheating. Something inside of me told me that his \u201cfriendship\u201d with that girl was not pure. He had other friends but I never felt anything wrong with those friendship. But this girl. It was different. He met her no more than 5 months ago. He jokingly called her and other female friends \u201cmy girlfriends\u201d. He went out of the way to help her with her workload, while complaining he had no free time and was swamped with work\u201d.  Said he didn\u2019t want to go to company events, but suddenly she was going and he had a change of mind. And when I asked him, you said you were not going, he would say, no I never said I wasn\u2019t going. When I found receipts of him out going out to dinner, he would deny it, when I had Evidence in my hands. It wasn\u2019t his or the cashier messed up. She for Xmas she sent him a personalized gift, I was so confused? Why did she do that? And he said bc she was just nice. For New Years, he was extremely upset we didn\u2019t go to her house to celebrate. I said I didn\u2019t want to spend a festive day with someone I don\u2019t really like. He said I was antisocial and we spent all New Year\u2019s Day and eve arguing about it. Then one day, she asked him to help her give her friends a tour of the city. And he went out to dinner with them. He hid the fact that she had invited him a few days before. He told me it was to grab \u201ccoffee\u201d and suddenly it was dinner so he can meet her friends.

After reading the stories here and in rbn, I've decided to share. 37F, married with kids. If I get through this without having a panic attack or crying, I'm going to seriously have some chocolate. There is no TLDR for this story, sorry.\n\nWhen my birth mother and father divorced, it was because he was sleeping with her 16 year old friend while she was in the delivery room giving birth to me. She remarried five days after my first birthday. For the longest time I didn't even know that the step wasn't my birth father. There was just this other guy who showed up at random times with presents and things. My BM and SF had two more kids during this time. When I was seven, my (m)grandmother told me that my 'dad' wasn't really my dad. After that, things starting to change. My BM started putting down my BF every change she got in front of me, complaining that the only reason she married him is because he was going to seminary school to become a pastor, and she just wanted to be a pastor's wife, she complained about the small amount of child support she got, and how she could only buy herself a few nice things every month for herself with it. My half-siblings picked up on things fast, and were quick to make comments about how I wasn't their 'real' sister, because we had different daddies. The step-father was working for a trucking companies up until I was 10, so he wasn't much of an influence in our lives unless he was home. Looking back, he was not a good influence then either. Both of them were fond of corporal punishment. The half sibs were rarely punished, but when punishments were dealt out, with was with a thick leather belt if it was the SF, or hair pulling and and hard slaps across the face by BM. \n\nFrom the age of 8 to 13, my BF was nonexistent in my life, and afterwards, I was only there for him to tell me all of my mother's faults, and how she drove him to cheat on her by refusing to have sex when she was pregnant with me and didn't keep a clean enough house.\n\nDuring this time frame, my parents only had one set of 'grown up' friends they would hang out with, and they would all get together in the living room, leaving me and the half-sibs at the mercy of their friend's sons. One of the sons would routinely drag me into the closet of a bedroom and hold a pillow over my face until I agreed to take off my pants and underwear. He made it very clear that if I ever refused or told anyone, he would do to my half sibs what he was doing to me. This went on for 2 years, until I turned 10.\n\nThings took  a drastic turn for the worse when I was 10. SF lost his job, BM had not been working for quite a while. Lost the house we were living in, ended up moving to a flat of land out in the country and into a handmade 1 room shack. No indoor plumbing or electricity in the middle of February. This is when I started to think the SF and BM changed, because the prior treatment was only when we were 'bad' so it was 'punishment'. Now the half sibs were treated as fragile things that could do no wrong, where as I received the brunt of the abuse. They both got jobs in nursing homes, working late hours. It became my responsibility to make sure me and the sibs got up, heated water over a wood stove to clean up as best we could, get to the bus, make sure we all got home that night, feed them, make sure they did their homework, and then I had to clean our tiny shack made of plyboard to standards that constantly changed BEFORE I could do my homework. If they came home at 11 at night and the 'house' was not clean enough, I was stupid for not knowing how to clean a house and useless and was forced to sleep outside with nothing to cover me or keep me warm, just whatever clothes I had on. \n\nThe defining moment for me in this time period was the following winter. SF finally relented and installed a hot water heater and a sink outside to wash dishes. I would wash them outside and carry them in wet to dry on a board before putting them up. A large, heavy cast iron skillet was on the board, and had gotten rust on the bottom of it. SF saw me and backhanded me, knocking my 6 year old glasses off of my face. They broke, and I ended up with a large bruise around my right eye. All because I didn't dry it on the camp stove and coat it with oil.... things I did not know you had to do with a cast iron skillet. He locked me in the house with him, blocking the only exit because I tried to run away. When my mother came home and asked what happened, he told her I let one of the 'good skillets' rust. She looked at me and told me that if anyone asks, to tell them I ran into a wall, because if they knew the truth, I'd never get to see my half sibs or my (m)grandmother that lived 8 hours away ever again. \n\nWe lived in that crap shack for a year and a half, until my (m) grandmother came down and gave them money to buy a mobile home to move onto the land. By this time, it was a daily occurrence that I was called fat, ugly, and stupid. I was a waste of food, time, and resources. If I got poor grades, it was because I was stupid. In fifth grade I went from a barely A to a C cup, so I was fat. I didn't end up with the pretty blue eyes and blond hair my mother hoped I would have, so I was ugly. The first time I had a period, my mother looked at me in disgust because I thought I was dying. No one had explained how the female body worked, and she said I was a moron for not knowing to get pads and use them, or when to stop using them each month. \n\nAfter getting the mobile home, they reconnected with their friends that had the boys. The abuse cycle started there again, and now he had acres and acres to drag me around and force me to do what he wanted. He was caught when we both got swarmed by fire ants, and turned it around saying I had begged for it, when I was sitting there, crying and in pain from nearly throwing up on him because he was forcing it down my throat so hard while fire ants were stinging my body. Whore and slut were added to the list of daily insults, and they were mad that they could no longer see their friends. I remember after their friends hurried and left, BM pulling on my hair and slamming me into a wall, and then something hard, heavy and metal hitting the back of my head. When I came to, I was on the floor and there was that god awful cast iron skillet right next to my head.\n\nFrom here until I graduated high school, it was a constant thing, being told I was so stupid I belonged in the state assisted facility for the mentally handicapped, that I was fat, ugly, and a whore. I was restricted to one meal a day, and even that was a waste of food in their eyes. Anytime anything went wrong, it was my fault, and thus, I became the receiving end of my SF's anger, often getting whipped with the heavy leather belt until I cried and then being whipped more for crying, or being shoved, having things thrown at me, or getting hit with the cast iron skillet. I started stealing the pills they stole from the nursing homes they worked in. I didn't know what they were, and I didn't care. I just didn't want to hurt or to care that I was hurting.\n\nWhen I became a senior in high school they insisted I 'pull my own weight' and get a job. After I got a job working full time for a fast food mexican chain, they both quit their jobs because with my income, they no longer qualified for food stamps. I was working full time, going to school full time, and the only one cleaning up after a family of five. I learned how to survive on one half price taco a day and less than 2 hours of sleep. \n\nNovember of my senior year of high school I was to the point of addiction that I stealing prescription medications on a regular basis from any source I could get to. I tried to run away from home one night after work, and general manager offered to let me stay with them. When I got to his house with him and his wife, he trapped me in a one-armed hug against a wall and pulled my pants down and had his way with me. Afterwards, he told me he couldn't risk going to jail for harboring a runaway, and dropped me off near the store I worked at. BM picked me up and forced me to come home, where both her and SF beat me and called me horrible things for trying to run away.\n\nA few weeks later, I came to work with heavy make up on due to another beating. A shift manager pulled me into the office and told me to take off my shades. I started to have a panic attack, because I knew what would happen. After he calmed me down, he called CPS and told me he was the victim of childhood abuse as well. A week goes by, and the CPS worker shows up at my job. She talks to me, and looked at where I had had a black eye and stated that it didn't look like a bruise to her. She then left and when my BM picked me up that night, SF was with her. He said CPS called him and said I called them to report child abuse. He told me to stop being such a weak bitch and to stop lying and that I was going to get what was coming to me when we got home. I remember walking into the house and a fist coming to my face, and waking up afterwards with him yelling for me to get my lazy ass up and clean the house.\n\nAfter that, I shut down emotionally for a while. The shift manager that tried to help me would still talk to me every day and helped as best he could. Around thanksgiving, I was working a shift and took a box cutter and put it into my pocket. I had decided I couldn't take it anymore, because even the stolen pills weren't helping. I had decided that that night, after work and cleaning house, I was going to run a bath of freezing cold water and kill myself. The shift manager must have noticed something was amiss, because he came down and sat with me on my meal break. He tried to talk to me, but I don't remember most of the conversation, just that I was giving one word replies. When he asked for the box cutter back, I remember asking him why and he said 'Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem'. \n\nI completely broke down. He ended up clocking me out for the rest of my shift and I spent most of the night hiding in the office, just alternating between panic attacks and tears. He helped me the rest of the school year. I would lie to my parents and go in early and stay late when he was working. He helped me push through my school work, convinced me to not drop out, and helped me get clean of my worst addictions. I had become a chain smoker by this time, but I was off the pills, my grades went way up, and he became the dad I never really had, though I didn't realize it at the time.\n\nAfter graduating high school, my BM told me that the only way I was going to get a college education was to go into the military, while at the same time, talked about how much better HER life would be with my military pay. I didn't want to do it, and while filling out the forms from the recruiter, the shift manager that was now my friend told me to only turn it in if I really wanted this. I should have listened, but I was so desperate to get away from my BM and SF that I turned it in. After being approved, my BM went to the store I worked in and told the general manager I quit. With no notice. Even though I had 3 more months until I was to go to basic training.\n\nI was put on the exit path during zero week of basic  for behavioral health issues. The stated that during analysis, I was suffering from depression and anxiety with suicidal tendencies. I was shipped home and my SF would not let me into the house to even sleep until he saw my discharge papers. I remember him yelling all the same slurs over again and me refusing to respond. I remember him getting up off the couch so fast it seems like a blur, and his hands around my neck and me blacking out shortly there after.\n\nI was 18 by this point, and after a few days, I ran. I had gotten a job in another fast food place, and had my then-boyfriend that my family hated pick me up. I moved in with him and his mother. He said they couldn't afford the fuel to take me to work half an hour away every day, so I quit my job. I lost contact with the friend I had made from the first fast food store I worked in. Slowly, over the course of about six months, my then boyfriend isolated me from anyone I knew, leading me to think it was my idea to cut these people out of my life. His idea of asking for sex was to walk into whatever room I was in and whack me on the face with his member. At the time, I had no idea this was also a form of abuse.\n\nThis went on for several months until my (m)grandmother mailed me a plane ticket to visit her. While there, one of my aunts offered to let me stay with her in North Carolina. I accepted it, and she said for me to go back to the boyfriend's and get my things and she will mail me a ticket to fly to where she lived. My BM called the last day before I was to go back. I begged my grandmother to not tell her when I was returning, but she did anyways, not understanding the fear I was in of having to deal with her and SF again.\n\nWhen I got off the plane, her, SF, and SF's half brother was at the gate, waiting. She wanted to know when I was coming back home. They blocked my path, wouldn't let me get by. When I tried to get out my cell phone to call my boyfriend, they snatched it out of my hands and told me I had to go home with them.\n\nThis was the first time I drew a line in the sand. I said no. If I couldn't go back to my boyfriend, then I would move in with the uncle. Neither parent was happy about it, but I refused to budge. The Uncle said it was okay with him, so long as I got a job right away and agreed to pay rent and help with fuel costs for getting to and from work. I agreed. While living with him, I found out my old shift manager was a friend of his through a local theatre as well as a table-top (pen and paper) role playing group. We started talking again, and it was through him that I realized that my current boyfriend was being manipulative and abusive. Things came to a head with the boyfriend admitted he would never use condoms because he felt that if he got me pregnant, my parents would force me to marry him, no matter how I felt. This scared me and I told my friend and he encouraged me to break off the relationship.\n\nThrough gaming, I met a guy that had known my friend since he was around 5 years old. Often times at the game table, it ended up that we would be sitting next to each other. I was very shy at this time and rarely spoke up unless spoken to. This guy would sit there and explain the rules of the games to me, make jokes that made me laugh, and eventually asked me out on a date. That was on February 9, 2000. We ended up dating and I became pregnant a few months later. While we were dating, I explained my family situation as best as I could at the time, and made jokes about how we take the fun out of being dysfunctional. He was quite blunt in telling me there is a huge difference between dysfunctional and abusive and that my family was clearly abusive in his eyes.\n\nMy BM said I HAD to marry him because my unborn child needed a father, and the only reason she married my SF was because I needed a father. This was my second line in the sand. I said no. If I married him, it would be because he asked and because I loved him. My child would have a father either way, because I would not cut him out of her life unless he became abusive to her. I also made it very clear to him that if we did get married, there were only two ways I'd ever leave: if he cheated on me, or if he became abusive to me or our kids. We moved in together and lived together as an unmarried couple until that December.  \n\nDuring this time, BM wanted to throw a baby shower for me, but with a lot of rules. I couldn't invite my friends or my husband's family, and the only guests would be her friends from work, who also worked with my step-grandmother, so I wouldn't even be able to acknowledge that my step-grandmother was family. I drew the line in the sand and told her that if I couldn't invite anyone I knew, then I was happier not having a baby shower.\n\nWe became Mr and Mrs on Dec 1, 2000. My BM was pissed that we didn't have a big formal affair at a church where she could invite all of her friends. We went to the JP and got married in the office with no fanfare because I could not take the physical and emotional stress of a large crowd. We had a post wedding party the week after, but even then, it was more about what my BM wanted at the party than what my husband and I wanted.\n\nWe had a beautiful baby girl in early January of the following year. Even this was not to my mother's liking. The staff told me I could have at most 2 birthing coaches with me, and since I couldn't have my mother in law and my mother both in the room with me and my husband, I chose to have only my husband in the room when it came time to push.\n\nOne would think that married, living away from the abusive parents, and having kids would have sent me free completely. I was now a full fledged adult with my own family and responsibilities. But it was not. First, it was their refusal to call my daughter by her birth name, claiming it was ugly and N-erish. Nevermind that the first name was Hebrew and the middle name French and rolled off the tongue beautifully when said together. Then came the complaints that she was 'slow' because she wasn't babbling a ton of baby words at 3 months. My BM went so far as to call local preschools for the mentally disabled, claiming to be the caretaker of MY daughter and wanted her to be evaluated for mental retardation. She would then have them call me. This went on for the first two years of my daughter's life. Meanwhile, we had done the best we could to be accommodating to both sets of grandparents. My husband's parents never complained about anything we wanted them to do or not do when they had the baby. BM was always trying to skirt around the rules.\n\nThen came the day that we spotted BM and  SF with my daughter. She was three at the time and by state laws, had to be in a car seat. I saw her standing up and facing the back window from the jump seat of their pick up truck from our car. We followed them to my step-grandmother's house and insisted on having our daughter back early because they were not only breaking the law, but putting MY daughter, THEIR granddaughter's life at risk. They gave her back and when I asked where the car seat was, BM replied, \"It's at our house. We couldn't fit it in the back seat of the truck, so we just left it.\" I told them to go get it and bring it back so I could take our daughter home, and they said that driving 30 minutes out to the house and 30 minutes back in was too much trouble, if I wanted it, I would have to go get it for myself.\n\nAt this point, my husband asked my step-grandmother if he could use her phone to report his in-laws for breaking the law and child endangerment. She refused to let us in the house. He ended up carrying her five blocks back to our house and I drove our car home, because we didn't want to risk her being in our car without a safety seat. We called the in-laws, and they came and picked me up because I was too scared to go to my parent's house alone to get the car seat. While there, BM and SF called me childish and stupid for thinking I had to have something so 'unimportant' as a car seat. My mother in law got between me and them because I started to have a panic attack and was on the verge of tears. We got the car seat and she calmed me down all the way home. \n\nWe went no contact for six months, and probably would have stayed that way except BM and SF spotted us out in the 'wild' at a local hardware store. I tried to avoid them, but BM ended up cornering me in the plumbing department. She did not apologize, but did ask if they used half-sib #1's car from now on and the car seat, if they could start seeing Rugrat again. I told her I would think about it, and she went on about how much half sib 1 and 2 were missing their niece, so I caved.\n\nThings went relatively smooth the next few years, though BM and SF complained a LOT about my daughter having imaginary friends during ages 3-5. I told them there was nothing wrong with imaginary friends when you are a little kid and SF started in on how she needed to grow up and get 'real' friends. I told him that having a good imagination was a sign of high intelligence and to leave her alone. Another line in the sand, though I didn't realize it at the time.\n\nIn 2007, I became pregnant with our son. The first one on my side of the family in five generations. My mother was over the top ecstatic. I didn't notice at the time, but suddenly all the attention was on my growing belly and Rugrat 1 was practically being ignored by BM, SF, Sib1 and Sib 2. Shortly after my son was born, we fell on hard times. My husband lost his job, I was still recovering from giving birth to my son and a tubal, and our landlord decided he wasn't going to work with us and evicted us. My in-laws had no room in their house, my friend from my teenage years had moved several hours away, and we had nowhere to go.\n\n  \nBM offered to let us stay with them until we were back on our feet. I had such a bad feeling about it, but I felt as if we had no choice. We applied for government assistance and moved in with them. My husband and I looked for work with a car that had a transmission going out, and I had to somehow find the trust that BM SF and the Sibs had grown up and learned how to be decent human beings. Over the course of the three months we were there, it was like things had not changed from when I was a teenager. I got a job, got up early to go to work, came home from work, made sure my daughter did her school work, and then cleaned all of the house while my husband took the car and went to work. My sibs bragged about how they never have to help with the house. My mother started putting down my daughter and tried to force her to do chores before homework and I told her she had no right to boss my daughter around, only to be hit with the 'my house my rules' line.  They ate all the food I bought for my kids and said I had gotten so fat after having two kids that I needed to go back to a starvation diet. Oftentimes they ate dinner before I got home from work and left nothing for me to eat, but still insisted that I had to wash the dishes they dirtied up. I stuck it out for 3 months because I knew we were going to have to replace the dying transmission in the car before we could start looking for a new home. It came to a head when one night my SF started yelling at me about how horribly my husband was for only working part time while I was working full time. I ignored him, and my mother called me rude. When I said that SF had no room to talk since he wasn't working at all while his legally blind wife was working full time, she slapped me. I ignored that too. Meanwhile, my daughter started crying. SF got up in her face and told her to stop crying or he would give her something to cry about and started to pull his belt off of his pants.\n\nI got up and got between him and her and told him that if he laid a finger on my daughter, I'd be calling 911 faster than his head could spin. He backed down but told me that I was not beating my kids enough, especially my son, who was in DIAPERS, and that if I didn't start beating my son, he would. I drew another line in the sand at that moment as I realized that none of them had changed, and none of them would ever change. I told SF that if he ever laid a hand on my kids, I would have him arrested on the spot. He told me to pack my shit and be out by the end of the week and to take my 'brats' with me. When my husband got home from work that night, I told him everything. He told me he would take care of it. I went to work the next morning and when I got off work, my husband and his mother were waiting for me. He had called her while I was at work and told her EVERYTHING. She came and picked him up and our son, and they went and pulled my daughter out of school and they had taken the kids to the in-laws house, where the FIL was watching over them. We took my car to their house and me, husband, and MIL made the 45 minute trip to BM's house to get my kid's things.  \nWhen we got there, they refused to give me even my daughter's clothes, and my SF proceeded to cuss me out, call me a cowardly stupid b\\*tch and Bm started yelling that my husband would never support me in the way that I deserved. I literally could not talk, just stood there shaking I was so angry and upset. MIL and husband got between me and them and told them that they were horrible people for not even wanting to let my daughter have clothes so she could go to school. SF got up in husband's face and threatened to kick his ass. My husband refused to back down and told him to go ahead and throw the first punch. There was a lot of verbal back and forth between them while BM accused me of being brainwashed and in a cult and demanded I apologize for putting them through such hardship. Finally, sib 1 proceeded to throw loose clothing out at us and my son's diaper bag while calling us names. We took what they gave us and left. The next day I called every relative I had the number for and told them that we are no longer on speaking terms with BM and SF and to not give out our contact information.\n\n2 days later, were were finally able to get the rest of our stuff from BM. While me, husband and MIL were retrieving our things, CPS showed up where my kids were, stating they had gotten a child abuse complaint. After talking to our kids and the relatives from my husband's side of the family, they determined it was a false allegation. The in-laws shared their tiny 2 bedroom home with us for 9 months. They watched our kids while we worked. We initiated safety procedures on what to do if certain people showed up at our house. Started teaching our kids gun safety, how to dial 911, all the escape routes to get out of the house we moved into and make it to the in-laws, who lived two houses away. We got a house phone with an unlisted number, 2 cell phones and a google voice number to ensure we always had a way to contact each other and the authorities if something went wrong.\n\nThat was 9 years ago come this September. Since then, the only times there has been contact has been when my mother has attempted to instigate it by calling the in-laws or by having her sisters or other children contact me. And every time it has been with promises of money, or a house, or a new car... with strings. Those strings being the ability to see my kids. Every time, I have said no. Everytime she accuses my husband of brainwashing and abusing me. Other relatives have attempted to guilt trip me into contacting them as well. When my daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, one of my aunts went behind my back and gave the phone number to my daughter's hospital room to my mother, even though I told her not to do this. When BM called, my daughter hung up on her. I have then stopped posting anything about my kids or the family on FB, because it's clear I can't trust them. Before my (m) grandfather passed away, he tried to get me to 'reconcile' and 'keep the family peace'. I told him that I am keeping the family peace by NOT contacting BM and et all, and the safety of my kids comes before her emotional needs to abuse my family.\n\n3 years ago, it was one of my aunts, telling me that sib 1 was pregnant with her second child and that her husband had left her, and that I needed to be there for her. I informed the aunt that I did not get sib 1 pregnant, therefore it was not my responsibility to look after someone that was a grown woman. Last week, it was the same aunt. SF passed away. I had already found out from a step-cousin that has been respectful of the boundaries I put into place. He died alone, choking on food and no one found him until it was too late.\n\nAunt wanted me to contact BM and give condolences and support her. I said no, because I didn't feel grief. I felt relieved. She tried to tell me that I told BM I would reconnect with her if she ever left SF. And I did. But she didn't leave SF, he died. To me, that's a big difference. I did send my mother a message through facebook, because I was not going to give her my cell number and I wanted to make it very clear where she stood in my life. I told her that I will not be attending SF's funeral, and for her to change her will to where only sib 1 and 2 got her things when she passes, because me and mine are happier without them and I have no want or need of her stuff. She hasn't replied back in a week. \n\nI am still struggling a lot of days. Trying to force myself to eat more than one small meal a day. The depression swings. the nightmares, the sudden panic attacks when I see one of them out in the 'wild' and trying to get away before any of them notice me. But every day, it gets easier. Out of the last 9 years, the last 3 have been the easiest. I haven't thought about them unless someone else in the family brings them to my attention, and I quickly shut down or change the topic of conversation. My daughter tells me often that she is happier without them, and my son remembers nothing about them. I'm not a perfect parent by any stretch, but I try to give my kids a place where they can feel safe to be themselves. My long-term friend has moved back into the area with his wife and kid, we all live close to each other and they consider him to be a grandfather type to them and I realized he is the father type I never got as a kid. My husband has worked very hard with me to get through the trauma and is my rock on my bad days, and my in-laws are so fiercely protective of me and my kids that it makes my heart swell. Some days I just get completely overwhelmed by the love and support I have now that I didn't have growing up that little tear duct fairies come and attack and I'm not crying, it's onion ninjas. Blood doesn't make family. YOU make your family.\n\nSorry this went on for so long, but after reading so many stories here and on RBN, I felt compelled to share. Thank you if you made it through all of this. None of you are alone and if I could hug each of you and call you brother and sister in person, I would. ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I'm new to reddit and I have joined just for this because it provides the anonimity  I need right now. \nI am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. I have never told anyone, not a soul but me and my abuser knows about it.

So here I am, maybe someone here would share my agony or maybe not. Today I will only post the short version, I intend on adding details and things I recollect only if anyone reads this.

I have been sexually molested from the age of 5 to 10. I wasn t raped and I never, so far as I remember, felt any kind of pain. I don t remember my grooming stage, and this is one of the things I hope to one day remember, because I have no idea how my 16 year old cousin convinced me to get naked and willingly into his bed. one of the first things i remember is him examining my vagina, using surgical gloves, while examining a biology textbook. we were in a sort of treehouse. my guess is that he had just recently moved in with us (another story for another time). i was loving with a very loving but sick mother and with both my grandparents. dad was out of the picture. my family was and is amazing. i missed nothing as a child. attention and gifts and anything. but somehow in our crowded house this happened. and i have been feeling guilty for the past 25 years because i should not have experienced pleasure. i should not have loved him. i only started hating him when i got my period (at 10!) and mom explained all about the birds and the bees. until then i was delusional and kept thinking ours was but a misunderstood kind of love affair. maybe he said that to me. .... there are very many things i blocked and i wish i could remember. because why would i have done some of the stuff i did? i need a hand here otherwise i might keep just going in circles. thanks for reading.

After months of focusing on myself after my nex\u2019s abuse I felt I was ready to get out there a bit and I\u2019ve been having a fling/friends with benefits thing with someone for the past month and a half and things were going really well and we had a great dynamic going. Until yesterday when we had a pretty big argument in which I said something with no ill intentions and they completely freaked out and got mad at me and we\u2019ve been going back and forth with me apologizing every time they point out what I said. They\u2019re now saying that I\u2019m \u201coverapologizing\u201d and that my reaction is a red flag that makes them weary of continuing this relationship and yet continue the conversation telling me why I acted shitty rather than ending it. I have talked to several of my friends about the specifics and they all told me I said nothing wrong, that they are overreacting and there is no need for me to keep apologizing or let them continue tearing me down. \n\nI\u2019ve felt ever since my ex\u2019s abuse and the aftermath that all it takes is for me saying the wrong thing and that someone will up-and-leave. Any disagreement or conflict with anyone sends me into a panic because I\u2019m used to shit hitting the fan with my nex and I assume that someone will hate me and cut me off if I express my feelings too clearly during a conflict and they disagree with me. I feel like I\u2019m \u201ctoo much\u201d and that I\u2019ll never be equipped for another relationship because of the damage that my nex did and how I react to things (in this case I defended myself in the most careful way possible because like I said, I always feel like I\u2019m walking on eggshells). I thought I made a lot of progress but it doesn\u2019t feel like it anymore. I feel like everyone will leave and that I can\u2019t trust anyone because if I react the wrong way or say the wrong thing that I\u2019ll be disposable and they will disappear. I feel disposable. I feel angry at my nex for putting me through what she did and that it has built these thought patterns in me. I feel angry that I walked on eggshells and apologized profusely to her for so long that I now continue to do that in all of my relationships because I\u2019m terrified of losing anyone else I care about. I feel angry that I\u2019ve worked so hard in therapy and processing my own emotions and that I\u2019m still feeling this way and reacting that way toward other people. I know everyone says in time I will heal and I believe/d that because I\u2019ve felt it but this has brought up all of that old fear and the fighting has been extremely triggering for me. I feel like I have too much damage and will never good enough for someone in that context. I\u2019ve worked so hard these past 8 months and I\u2019m realizing just how much my nex\u2019s actions still affect me and I feel so discouraged and exhausted. I just feel damaged beyond repair.

He is full of warmth and affection, constantly in contact but without any pressure to rush into titles or change my lifestyle. He's similarly career-oriented and doesn't want children. He's very good looking, smart, and makes me feel comfortable and reassured. I can talk to him for hours on end and never get bored, he peppers the conversations with constant compliments about me. He makes me feel safe to tell him anything or express my needs.\n\nTwo weeks into it, I notice only one orange flag. It's that I suspect he has some preferences (in and out of the bedroom, super minor stuff that I'm either indifferent to or excited about, nothing I'm against). I offer to make some adjustments- for example, I suspect he does not like that I just have sweatpants at home, but I also have been thinking about buying some silk pajamas for months, I just didn't want to spend the money if no one would ever see them. So, I tell him I'm going to buy some sexy new home outfits and he can even come help me pick them out. He insists if I change anything \"for him\", I will resent him for it eventually. He seems super resistant to me buying new pjs at all now. He is tense. I sense I shouldn't bring it up again. I sense that if I do now buy them, he will think less of me for \"changing\" myself to please him. I feel like I'm going to be constantly in lose-lose mode, like the Kobayashi Maru of relationships.\n \nThree weeks into it, he comes over to my apartment. He's 3 hours late (with explanation nbd) and I've just eaten. He says my breath smells, but doesn't want me to brush my teeth even after I offer. He seems disappointed I have sweatpants on. He seems disappointed the wine I give him has sediment in the bottom of the glass. He says \"your condo looks like an apartment\" in a weird, non plussed way. I feel as though I've disappointed him, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe next morning, I apologize for the wine being poor quality. He sends me a text back:\n\"It wasn't the wine I'm worried about. your breath though\"\n5 minutes later:\n\"I mean, that was just offensive\"\n5 minutes later:\n\"You know smells are linked to memories, right?\" (laughing face)\n\nI ignore his messages, confused. He sees me not responding and texts an apology. It seems sincere. Maybe he is just joking. I shrug it off. We later have a super weird conversation where he takes a side note from a joke I made to point out that I took public transit and he would never do that. I'm a little taken aback, probably make a face, and I point out I value public transportation a lot, but whatever. I can't force everyone to take it, nowhere near a deal breaker. I forget about this easily, too.\n\nTwo days later, we go to dinner. I sit down. He says \"I told my mom about you. I told her you think I'm an elitist. She told me 'if this girl isn't on board with your vision, you need to get rid of her!\" I am immediately hurt, but he spins out the conversation into other topics quicker than I can count. I try to defend myself, \"I never called you an elitist. The fact that you won't take a bus isn't a big deal to me. You didn't have to have that conversation with your mother. I don't see how this has anything to do with me not supporting your career. I was just trying to impress on you that I don't spend money on things like nice cars or ride shares or shampooing my car if that's a deal breaker for you.\"\n\nHe then goes into a hypothetical situation where I'm picking up a friend from the airport and they're disgusted with the interior of my car. I tell him my friends are just happy to see me. I'd just be happy to be picked up from the airport.\"\n\"People don't pick you up from the airport?\"\n\"Er, no, not really, they all have boyfriends\"\n\"See, the way I take care of my car conveys that I care about my guests and their comfort. I'm a good host. Maybe that's why no one picks you up\"\n\nI start crying. \nHe explains he's just contrarian and was trying to \"win\" the conversation. He apologizes. I am still trying to bring the conversation back to the negative conversation he relayed to me that he had with his mother, and why he'd tell me such a thing, especially after he knew my last attempted relationship ended when the last guy told his mother I had endometriosis and his mother encouraged him to dump me and the man relayed that conversation to me. So, I'm heavily triggered by the previous breakup. I ask a couple of times if he said anything at all positive about me, but he deflects and I never get an answer. I don't dump him. I am confused. My friends are all wondering if I'm being too dramatic/picky/etc.. I should give him a chance. It's one mistake.\n\nThe next day, he is as warm and affectionate as ever, like nothing's happened. My friends meet him and are impressed with how nice and into me he seems.  3 hours later, he criticizes the way I perform in bed, harshly and in the moment. He compares me to the \"hundred or so\" women in bed. He says the prettiest women are the least active, and the most unattractive are the most active in bed, and I am both very pretty but the single most 'aggressive' woman he's ever been with. His tone is very harsh. His face looks disgusted and horrified. I hadn't done anything I considered aggressive. I cry harder, he gets up and starts playing guitar.\n\nThe next day he dumps me. He says \"I don't do crying.\" He points out my breath from that one day. He points out that I didn't make my bed or put extra pillows on it for him. He points out the sweatpants. He says there are differences in \"problem solving\". He says women who are strong and self assured get angry, not sad. he'd prefer if I got angry and seems to imply I have low self esteem by being sad and not angry. He says I cried TWICE in one weekend, he looks at me as if to say this is crazy, you are crazy. He says dating me longer would cause too many 'compromises' on both ends, which I would regret him for, and which would be toxic. He points out that he's not dumping me, because you have to be in an official relationship to dump someone. \n\nWhat the hell happened here?

And I don't remember exactly what happened but you did something that made (Older Brother) say something like \"You should live up to your name, Grace!\" Which yeah he shouldn't of made a comment like that, but that's what siblings sometimes do, ***But*** what shocked me was how your mom responded by *laughing* and saying \"Good one, (Older Brother)!!\" instead of telling him not to do that to family. Of course I didn't say anything but I internally I was like \"*WTFF* \\*Did you mom really just support her son disrespecting and being rude to his own sister??\"  \n Another example is just how much your siblings would make fun of your interests or make rude comments. Which was extremely unnecessary, they should be happy that their sibling has a interest they like!! When I was little I could never understand. And I noticed your mom never really liked, discipline then you guys were being disrespectful to eachother (I mean I'm sure she has before. But I never saw it) But now, I could tell it stems insecurity. Your siblings don't target you because of *you*, I've noticed they do this with eachother to. It's just, growing up in a household with a strict sense of religion *AND* mental illness? Yeah those are the ingredients for insecure people to form.  And again, I aint tryin to talk shit because your mom is awesome! And your family does love eachother. But that still doesn't change the fact that there was toxicity going on, and it has understandably effected you.\"\n\nThis is just a couple of examples of many years of events.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brothers made fun of anything and everything I liked, and my mom never did anything really serious about it. It went on through my entire childhood. It made me feel insecure, and that I was weird. A freak. That my interests would make the world make fun of me. When I was in Art Therapy as a teen and I spoke about how I liked Nick Jr at an older age, I was shocked to see other people be fine with it. One even saying Nick Jr is the bomb. It wasn't a big deal, nobody made fun of me. That was not normal to me.\n\nWhen I finally gave up Nick Jr because I was tired of being belittled every time I wanted to go watch TV, my brothers made fun of how I liked Vocaloid and Japanese music. I genuinely cannot get into the Megaman series because of these happenings, because it only reminds me of everything my brothers did to me.\n\nWhen my dad and brothers would make jokes about me and I retaliated because I felt like they were making fun of me, they just told me to build a thicker skin and that it was just a joke. I got genuinely upset when they would make jokes about me, and they would just tell me to take it. I'm not sure if this is bad, I kinda think it is. It made me feel like I was overreacting and I was just a stupid bitch who couldn't take a joke. It made me feel insecure, both the jokes bothering me, and people saying I was just overreacting.\n\nAll this made my anxiety disorder start to form at a young age. I remember having horrible anxiety at the age of 10 or younger, because of our religion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I grew older my interests shifted. I was a teenager going through my edgy phase I was into Creepypastas, horror, and a game called OFF. All of which I still adore today.  \nMy mom is a helicopter mom though, and hated when you liked anything she deemed inappropriate. Even put on internet filters when we were all fucking teenagers. I'm talking 14 and older, not little kids. I knew if I liked this stuff, she would take away all my comforts. My online friends, my shows vids and comics I liked, and possibly even my best irl friend who is my biggest comfort and is the one who pointed out all this and made me really think of how my childhood affected me.\n\nI grew so paranoid. I developed an eating disorder, I started to self harm really badly, even starting to go psychotic I think.\n\nMy mom is much better now, and even lets me ramble about my interests, even my preference for 80's horror effects rather than cgi. Still, I had never felt so helpless in my life than in that time.\n\nBut my mom really was a helicopter mom and it crippled us as kids. She would keep us at home at all times, and only let us have friends from church. (Nobody there liked anything I liked. I was the odd kid out and barely talked to anyone. I made one friend. That's it.) She barely let us go to any places, she homeschooled us, and was extremely overprotective of us. My brother honestly resents her for not letting him have a social life as a kid. I personally have trouble knowing what to do in social situations, I think because I never had any chances to practice at a young age.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll this has made me crippled in real life. I have bipolar disorder and anxiety, possibly ADHD too. All this has formed how I take in the world, and it's toxic. I need to know what to do to break this. What can I do to change how I feel about things. How the fuck do I stop panicking and taking everything possibly pointed at me as an insult or an attack? I'm not sure what to do? I just need to ramble, my friend said finding a support group on reddit would help me. I'm new to reddit and have no idea how all this works so forgive me if I fuck anything up.\n\nI'm gonna lurk and see if I can help other people while I wait for this post to gather replies.

Please help me understand.", "author": "thepsymaddoc", "self_text": "Reading about DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender), I started questioning something about my current relationship. \n\nIn all of our fights, she tells me I do exactly this. AFTER I tell her this is what she is doing to me. Here's an example: \n\n*she is acting distant, not saying anything, not looking in my direction, giving me one-worded answers to any questions I ask when trying to engage her some way* \n\nME: Why are you acting distant? Are you ok, are you upset with me?\n\nHER: I'm not distant, this is how I am. \n\nME: Well, it feels like you have a grey cloud above your head, and that makes me wonder if you're alright.\n\nHER: The only one of us with a grey cloud above their heads is you. You're so insecure, just because I'm not all over you, you assume I don't love you and that I'm mad at you.\n\nME: You are literally acting like you're mad at me...\n\nHER: You are the one acting like that, but you're denying it. I'm the one that feels like you're mad at me.\n\nME: I'm not mad, I just want to spend quality time with you...\n\nHER: Well then stop picking on me!\n\nME: I'm sorry, I wasn't trying to, I just want us to be ok...\n\nHER: Yeah, fine.\n\nThe thing is, I can see that this is a reoccurring pattern. I can distinctly feel like I used to be able to tell when this was happening, but recently it doesn't feel as clearer anymore. I'm constantly doubting myself, my actions towards her, and even my intentions. Sometimes I feel like a child, incapable of telling right from wrong, as it feels I'm mostly doing the wrong things around her.\n\nI'm also very frustrated. She basically lives at my place (she stays here at least 3 weeks per month), but refuses to do any cleaning, nor does she contribute with money. She does cook often, even if there is food, because she likes to eat diversely, but leaves everything dirty and where she used it. IF repeatedly asked, she will do these, after letting me know how much these upset her. She says her reasoning when it comes to cleaning is this: if I don't clean all the time and my home isn't spotless, I'm wrong to question her cleanliness &amp; she is a guest in my home, so it should be only natural I do the cleaning. \n\nI told her I don't regularly clean (I do on weekends) because I work 2 jobs and working on my PhD and am quite tired during the week. She says I'm just too demanding when it comes to her.\n\nWhen she has issues with me, she always uses bad words. Usually, they reference my mom, or me being stupid or an idiot.\n\nShe constantly owes me things. Like 50-100$ for weeks at a time, or the present she got me for Christmas. If asked about these, she makes sure to make me feel bad about asking.\n\nWhen I'm alone, I'm constantly thinking about our dynamic, and I realize something is very wrong. Sonehow, things feel simple again and feels like the fog in front of my eyes dissipated. So I collect my thoughts and then talk to her when we meet. She accuses me of jumping to conclusions on my own and then attacking her for unfounded reasons. This really messes with my brain, 'cause I cannot confirn nor deny if she is right.\n\nThere are more thing I want to write, but this post is already longer than I intended.\n\nAM I DATING A NARC? Or am I the narc? \n\nYou'd think, as the psychologist I am, I should be able to answer these. But I don't feel objective anymore.

As I\u2019m adjusting to this new change, I have been not only remembering the good times, but also the bad times. And that has helped me from picking up the phone and calling him. \n\nI remember being pregnant for the first time and we got into a fight. I went to my parent\u2019s house to get away from him. He texted, called me, left voicemails, and emailed \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about you and your fucking child. Go get fucked by someone else, have an abortion and kill that child, I don\u2019t give a fuck\u201d. I was shocked, in disbelief that he would say such horrible things. And he didn\u2019t just do it once, not twice, but 5 times. His mom eventually got involved. She called me asking me to forgive him for what he has done, that he is very sorry. By then, a combination of a high risk pregnancy and trauma, i miscarried. I remember being in the hospital wanting to save my child, seeing all the blood and remembering his hateful words. It was traumatizing. Yet, I gave him another chance. \n\nAnother time when we were living together, he got upset, don\u2019t remember the reason, just that it was a big fight. He ended up kicking me out. That\u2019s his thing even till I walked out. I paid rent, some months I would even pay rent for the both us. And yet, when he was mad, he would always say, \u201cget the fuck out if you don\u2019t like it\u201d. I was so tired of hearing that, he knew I had no family in that city, and had no real place to go. But I was so tired of feeling like that place that I built to be my home was actually never mine. So, I left, and I stayed in the in the lobby of the school pretending to study. I showered I. The school gym. Why? Bc I didn\u2019t want others to know what happened. I was embarrassed. Eventually I stayed on the couch of friend\u2019s place. \n\nAnother time we were pregnant again. In another moment of rage, he again went crazy. Again, he kicked me out WHILE I WAS PREGNANT!!!!  Had no care. Sent me an email saying he was \u201cwashing his hands from me and that seed, get an abortion, that\u2019s the best thing for you\u201d. Then later was was like \u201cI hate you and your child, now I\u2019m trap\u201d then \u201cI will love my child but stay away from you\u201d i asked him to leave me at peace. That arguing was not good for the child or me. I begged him. I just re-read the emails and I was begging him to hold his tongue and don\u2019t say anything hurt again. I begged him. But the more I did, he played the victim, saying how I was a worthless bitch trying to keep him from his child. Omg!!!! How!!! Me kicked me out, he wrote the stuff about washing his hands from us and to have an abortion. I just wanted peace. I didn\u2019t want to fight. And I told him that and I begged him. \n\nAnd then the cheating. Something inside of me told me that his \u201cfriendship\u201d with that girl was not pure. He had other friends but I never felt anything wrong with those friendship. But this girl. It was different. He met her no more than 5 months ago. He jokingly called her and other female friends \u201cmy girlfriends\u201d. He went out of the way to help her with her workload, while complaining he had no free time and was swamped with work\u201d.  Said he didn\u2019t want to go to company events, but suddenly she was going and he had a change of mind. And when I asked him, you said you were not going, he would say, no I never said I wasn\u2019t going. When I found receipts of him out going out to dinner, he would deny it, when I had Evidence in my hands. It wasn\u2019t his or the cashier messed up. She for Xmas she sent him a personalized gift, I was so confused? Why did she do that? And he said bc she was just nice. For New Years, he was extremely upset we didn\u2019t go to her house to celebrate. I said I didn\u2019t want to spend a festive day with someone I don\u2019t really like. He said I was antisocial and we spent all New Year\u2019s Day and eve arguing about it. Then one day, she asked him to help her give her friends a tour of the city. And he went out to dinner with them. He hid the fact that she had invited him a few days before. He told me it was to grab \u201ccoffee\u201d and suddenly it was dinner so he can meet her friends.

I am a real person. A real person who has been a victim of sexual, physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual abuse.  I\u2019ve decided to write about this publicly for several reasons. First because I have to write about this. It has to come out. Words are my tool. Second, I have always felt alone in this, and I don\u2019t want anyone else to feel that way, if they don\u2019t have to. Third, I am so sick of keeping this deep dark secret. \n\nToo many people are abused every day, and society allows it to stay in the dark, because no one who hasn\u2019t experienced it, and even those who have, do not want to face the knowledge that true evil exists in this world. I am not writing about my experiences to be pitied or seek attention. If you do feel for me, focus that love on the child me, who needed hope, the teen me who was so lost and confused, the me in my twenties who needed love and support to break free. The following will be a straight forward account of my life experiences pertaining to abuse.  \n\n I have no memory of the first time. I only know, it\u2019s all I have every known. From a young age, and I may never know exactly when, my dad sexually abused me. He abused others as well, but their stories are not mine to tell. I literally have no memories of a life before being sexually abused. My earliest memories are from around 2-3 years of age. And they extend until possibly 5. My mom did eventually divorce him. He was allowed visitations and I can remember being in his care. I do not remember seeing him after beginning kindergarten. Except occasionally, around holidays. I did not begin seeing him again consistently until I was 12 or 13. At no time was the sexual abuse talked about, I received no counseling. No one discussed it with me. I was left to process it on my own. Which means I pushed it down and had a skewed idea of what love was, sex was, intimacy was, etc. I lived with my mom from the time she divorced him until I was 14. My mom was abusive as well, she sure loved to hit us, with belts, wooden spoons, she flew into rages for no reason. She ridiculed and mocked me anytime I shared my inner thoughts and feelings. When I was 14 I had been having regular visitation with my dad. His wife adeptly manipulated me into hating my mom and soon I fought with my mom, she punched me in the face and kicked me out. I moved in with my dad and step mom and my younger sisters. \n\nI lived at my dad\u2019s until I was almost 17, a little over two years. Half my freshman year, my sophomore year and my junior year of High School. I am fairly sure I was not abused sexually by my dad during that time. Though I was abused sexually by my step uncle during that time, and my step mother was mentally, emotionally, and physically abusive. I was witness to other abuse, but again, not my story to tell. It all became too much, I ran away with the help of my neighbors and went back to my mom.\n\nI lived with my mom for my Senior year of High School, and moved in and out several times from 18 to 21. I had what I thought was normal relationships, and experiences\u2026 hardly that looking back now. Why no one felt I needed counseling or therapy is completely beyond me. In comparison to what I had already experienced and what was to come, nothing in that time really stands out as particularly bad, at least in comparison. \n\nSo, at 20 I met Harry. I was with him for 10 years. This person is one of the worst kinds of narcissists. He emotionally, mentally, sexually, and spiritually abused me. He cut me off from my family. He isolated me, he controlled all aspects of my life. He told me what to eat, when to exercise, what to wear, how to act, what to like, what to think. Looking back, it seems miraculous that I escaped with my life. There were times when I thought I would not.\n\nIt\u2019s now a little over 11 years later, and I am safe. I am in a loving relationship. I\u2019m a mother. I have family and friends that support and love me. I have PTSD, Depression &amp; Anxiety. I go to counseling. I take medication to help me on this journey. I write. I am healing. I have to consciously work everyday. Some days are amazing. Some are really fucking hard.

Throwaway account because yeah.\n\nWas with an abusive husband a thousand miles from home. Had a baby, needed to leave, but was penniless. The only person willing to help out was my mother, who to her credit, has housed us for a year. But she was pretty emotionally abusive to me growing up, and gave into the pressure her pedophile father (now dead) put on her to leave me alone with him, then got jealous of the attention he gave me (she was his first victim). So, she's the reason I was raped before I was even in kindergarten, and honestly I'm kind of scared of her and even though she's mellowed with age, I don't think it's been good for me or my child to live with her. But I'm stuck. I have autism, among other things, so basically, I'm unemployable, and I'm trying to raise this baby alone.\n\nYesterday my mother said she was going to bed but wasn't going to sleep just yet. so I played with the baby and put her to bed like usual. I told her she could read as long as she was quiet, and went down the hall to work for a bit (I pull in what I can freelancing 30+ hrs a week, but it doesn't pay a lot). My mother's husband passes by her room, notices her light is still on, barks at her to go to sleep. Of course, crying ensues, because she's freaking three years old, so I go to try to calm her down, and then my mother shows up all pissed and stands there in her pajamas and yells at us for several full minutes that she's going to wake everyone up at 5AM tomorrow just like her so they know what it's like not to get any sleep, and \"this has gone on for weeks,\" and \"it's ridiculous\" and she's so accommodating because she hasn't said anything about it and 10PM is way too late for the baby to be awake and blah blah blah and she flounces off and slams the door, and the baby is now screaming and crying because Grandma came in and had this tantrum for no reason without any warning whatsoever.\n\nThis isn't the first time this kind of thing has happened, and the baby says things like, \"I don't like living with Grandma and Grandpa,\" and she's afraid to pass their doorway to go to the bathroom at night because their ire is unpredictable. My heart breaks for her, and I feel so powerless. And I can't tell you the kind of awful feelings it produces in me, too, because of my history with my mother and my recent abuse at the hands of my husband, plus with how helpless I feel to do anything for myself or my child, and how humiliating it is to feel like I have to put up with it because I'm too afflicted (or lazy, as she'd probably call it) to be independent.  She doesn't really believe in mental illness and thinks despite the autism, depression, PTSD, etc that there's nothing stopping me from finding and keeping a job that would pay me enough to live on, alone, with a kid.  And I feel like she's entitled to be angry with me because I'm freeloading in her house with my kid because I made a poor choice in marriage. And I also get that living with my impairments is frustrating. Maybe she communicated to me that she didn't want us up so late, but I just didn't \"get the message\". \n\nAll I know is it feels like walking on eggshells, and it feels exactly like being an abused little kid again, and exactly like the stress of living with my ex-husband. And now I have to watch my daughter live with it, because I am too fucked up to Adult. I'm just trying to live my life and get away from a toxic marriage, but now it's just more toxicity; I'm more worried about what I'm going to make for supper for my mother every day than about what I'm going to make my own child. Is she going to come home and scream at me about it that day? Probably not, but you can bet she's watching, and making little tally marks and calculating all of my activities for the day. And it feels like if I could just keep her happy, she won't have a reason to start focusing on me.\n\nI even had to start using the desktop computer for all my activities (work, applications, resume building, taxes, household paperwork, etc), because she told me Grandpa (retired) sees me \"sitting around playing on the phone all day\". I mean, I know older people don't always understand that phones can be used for things other than texting and games, but something about assuming that, and then telling me about it, like she wanted me to know I was being watched, it just really bothers me. I even worry that my favorite location to work in in the house is \"under surveillance\", as it can coincidentally be seen in the background of one of the home security cameras. It's caused me to wonder if they're adding up how many hours I'm working per day to see if it meets their standards, whatever that might be. But that's part of the thing; I'm very literal, and I'm pretty practical. It makes sense to me that you might make living in your home contingent upon some sort of conditions, but it never seems like those are made clear. It's like they're purposefully vague so she can just jump out and start yelling at me about something she seemed fine with yesterday, whenever her boss gave her shit at work and she wants to take it out on somebody. \n\nPlus, at heart I just feel so alone. I feel ungrateful for wishing for this, because it's been incredibly generous to let us live here for so long, but sometimes I imagine what it would be like to be recovering from an abusive marriage with a mother that made me feel loved. She would say it's a childish fairy tale, and that no such mother exists. But I have a hard time imagining behaving toward my own daughter in such a situation the way she behaves toward me. If I thought for one second I was causing her pain like I feel right now ... And I can't imagine doubting and suspecting her the way my mother does me. Maybe I just don't know what it was like raising a kid with invisible special needs in the early '80s, maybe I was (and am) just difficult, and I'm lucky I don't have the same challenge with my own daughter.\n\nI used to fear being alone and poor because of how unhappy it would make me, but with a kid I just feel positively panicked to find something like stability or security, and yet I've never felt farther from finding it, or more hopeless that I could ever achieve it. I don't even know what to call the situation I'm living in right now, because I am an adult, so by all rights I should be able to leave and support myself. And at one point I was able to do that for almost a decade, but it was a pretty specific situation, and I'm so much less \"able\" now that I went through all this with my ex, not to mention I now have a child to take care of. But because my mother can't be expected to see it that way, maybe she's right in her own way. I have no idea whether to be angry or just feel ashamed of myself for being so useless. I feel like I do a lot during the day to take care of my daughter and spend time with her and see she has what she needs. But measured against what \"normal\" people do all day, it's probably not a whole lot.\n\nTLDR: Living with bullshit, pretty confused as to whether it's my fault, feel hopeless to change it anyway.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Neither of us went into detail about it and haven\u2019t talked about it since because it\u2019s sickening but we both get very uncomfortable when in close proximity with him and when he looks at us.

I made the mistake of believing all of his empty promises (that I've heard a million times before and fell for) and moving across the country for a job opportunity for him - at great expense to my own job growth, my finances, and my happiness. For some reason, his actions - which proved that he didn't love me over and over again - never stopped me from believing his promises. But he finally said out loud that the reason he didn't try at all to make me even the tiniest bit happy after I moved for him, is because he didn't care enough about me to try. It was like a switch went off in my brain. I got myself off of the lease, got myself back on my own health insurance (I figured he would randomly rip that away from me or lord it over me, knowing I have chronic health conditions), packed all my stuff, and am currently waiting for him to return and see if he'll allow me to use the car to drive to ship them before the store closes. If not, tomorrow I'll carry the heavy boxes myself half a mile away and ship them myself. I get paid tomorrow, so I'm purchasing a plane ticket, and Saturday I'm out of here.

It will be like every other time - a few weeks will pass, and I'll get a text or phone call explaining how sorry he is, and x, y, and z are why he treated me so horribly. But he's changed now, so please come back. I will not allow myself to fall for it again. I've wasted what were probably the best years of my life, I've lost all of my dreams... There's simply no reason for me to continue being with him, I would rather be alone the rest of my life than walk on eggshells constantly, be emotionally and verbally abused, and have everything constantly be my fault. For the first time in a long time, I have this strange feeling - I supposed it's happiness and excitement. I don't know for sure, since it's been so long since I've felt any positive emotions. I feel like a weight has been lifted. I know it will be tough. I know there will be times where I wonder if I've made a mistake. But I hope, and think I will be, strong.\n\nMy question is, how do you deal with people who think you're just a bitter ex-girlfriend? I'm worried that some of my family members, who absolutely adored him, will \"choose\" him over me. I don't want that. I love them, and I hope they love me back, but there's that voice in the back of my head saying that they'll just think I'm saying this stuff out of anger, since I worked so hard to pretend for 15 years that everything was fine in our relationship, when it was anything but. How much do you share about what you've been through, since unless you've experienced firsthand, you have no idea the absolute hell it is? Should I just try to avoid seeing them (I can't avoid them completely), or is there some way I can explain what I've been through without it coming out the wrong way?\n\nAgain, I want to thank you wonderful people. You've helped me more than you can know.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I love my friends and they know my Nex was shitty, but it's very hard to express the actual details and accounts of the narc and relationship after lurking and learning from here for so long.. I hope they never, ever experience it, but it's truly something hard to understand until you go through it. These are my thoughts I've had today.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI broke up with my Nex 4 months ago, but he stayed in my life as a \"friend\" (which now I realize he pushed major boundaries disguised as \"caring\" for me during this time) until he had one more final major attempt through lovebombing on the first day of my new amazing job. This past weekend, I learned he had a new girlfriend AKA new supply and I lost it. I shouldn't have, but I asked someone to send me the snapchat for proof. I was a wreck. I drunkenly lashed out at him which now I know it's what he exactly wanted. He said awful, disgusting things that completely contradicted his love bombing from 3 weeks ago. Called him out on that. He kept going but I ignored and blocked. I then got myself together, deleted ALL my socials until further notice (I know myself.. I would creep or seek validation), and sought out therapy. \n\nSince I am no longer on socials, I have been reading so many articles, listening to podcasts, and reading through this sub. I am probably going to post more as I find more things that have helped with healing because 3 days ago, I was a wreck, wondering how someone who I had a great bond with could move on so fast and say such awful things they know I'm insecure about after professing so much love to me. We have a matching tattoo together, went through the loss of a baby together, talked about marriage constantly and had so many things we bonded over... Now, I am realizing that **nothing was ever real except for the abuse.** \n\nSomething I found helpful was writing the bad memories, uncomfortable situations or red flags, and then writing the good memories and qualities that I liked. What I found was the bad things GRAVELY outnumbered the good, and that the qualities I liked were very shallow such as \"tall\" LOL. Maybe because all of the good things came at a price, or had some dramatic incident prior.\n\nAll of those times you thought \"Hmm that's weird\" or \"Am I crazy?\" or \"This isn't normal\" or \"How could they say that?\" or \"This doesn't add up/make sense\" or even stumbled upon this sub, your instincts right, but **you were being controlled and conditioned** through that lovely \"connection.\" \n\nI've been thinking about all the things that I looked past, and how the abuse was right there in my face. Damn. It sucks. I feel so dumb, but I feel so empowered knowing all of this now. That there was nothing wrong with me and that I was preyed on. That real love is not supposed to hurt or confuse me. That I am no longer susceptible to this abuse, nor am I jealous or feel inferior to this new supply.  That now I am in a place to heal so that one day I will experience what I **thought** I had, except it will be 100x better because it will be the real thing without abuse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWriting all this out allowed me to organize my thoughts.

And he says he said nothing, or repeat the sentence BEFORE the muttering. One time in particular he joked about mopping and having a heart attack, and then something about \"not very big one\" and then said \"I hope she didn't hear that,\" and I said hear what? And he ignored me. Weird behavior.\n\nAnother thing is that he will make me do weird things. I work as a cashier. And he made me clean the ledge of the windows outside. He made me dust off the top of end caps (the end of isles) that looked like they haven't been dusted in years.\n\n\nAlso, he will say things *to* or *with* my coworkers in conversation, seemingly low-key about mistakes I've made. It sounds crazy but I've been through this before with sneaky friends, it goes like this. He said, \"Melanie did a fantastic job setting the produce out. I'm glad she doesn't just stand around. We hate to just stand around, don't we Melanie?\" She laughed and nodded.

I find the marriage very difficult. At the moment we are taking some time apart from each other. I am writing this to try to understand what is going on in the relationship and to get some answers to try to understand her behaviour.\n\nI realise that many people here are not professionals but it would be good to have an opinion. I have read many articles on narcissism and here are some examples of things I think are narcissitc behaviour. I will back them up with examples as often as I can.\n\n\\- she takes little interest in me or my achievements. I have had a few academic papers published and she has not read one of them. The first time I was published we went out to celebrate and she wasn't interested in discussing it, and would just nod when I brought it up.\n\n\\- she is wonderful to her friends and they all think she is amazing, however at home she can be rude, disrespectful and verbally abusive.\n\n\\- when I was down and crying a couple of weeks ago as a result of her behavior, she seemed to enjoy it and appeared to be gloating.\n\n\\- she shows little interest in my needs, as she once said, \"your needs are not my problem\" - this comment hurt me so much I wrote it in a diary years ago.\n\n\\- she often blames me for problems which are hers e.g. suggesting I go to counselling because I am distraught by my parents' divorce when I believe she is the one who is distraught by her parent's divorce: she forbids her father to have another woman. I do not think I am distraught by my parents' divorce, neither do my parents. Another example is that she told me to cut down on alcohol for health reasons, but she abuses alcohol and sometimes ends up vomiting because she has drunk too much. She also makes herself sick after she eats sometimes.\n\n\\- she has used sensitive personal information against me e.g. telling my mother about problems in our sex life after I specifically asked her not to.\n\n\\- when I had known her for a few months I made a note in my diary saying she was a compulsive liar. But now I'm not so sure.\n\n\\- she often imagines what I'm thinking or feeling and uses it against me, I often tell her she is annoying herself or \"pissing herself off\" by doing this. She often needs to define me by saying, \"you are only doing X because of Y\".\n\n\\- she loves to be the one to talk and is not very interested in my responses. She changes the subject often. She is not good at admitting she is wrong in conversations and finds it hard to apologise.\n\n\\- She has big problems with intimacy and can only be physically intimate in total privacy, ideally with the lights off and the blinds closed. This includes kissing or holding hands which she does not like doing in public. When she sees others kissing she says its 'dishonourable'. I was her first boyfriend and she was nearly 30. She says she wasn't interested in men in real life because she got satisfied by reading fantasy books and playing computer games.\n\n\\- I have sometimes lamented not having who she was when we first dated back, to which she once responded, \"I am not that person anymore\".\n\n\\- she has said a few times that she has \"a very fragile ego\".\n\n\\- I feel we do not have proper conversations, often it is just monologues from her. She is great at diverting conversations and is a master of changing the subject at a second's notice.\n\n\\- she tells me she loves me a lot, but I feel psychologically abused by her and confused.\n\n\\- she has fantasies of a grand life, buying big houses and boats and being like a Victoria Secrets model. I don't really care, I just want us to be happy together.\n\n\\- she has always pressured me to get big and muscly but I have no interest in that and never have. I feel that she is always raising the bar and is more interested in what she can turn me into rather than what I am.\n\n\\- if she can't get what she wants, she shouts and screams until she gets it. If she still doesn't get it, she sometimes threatens divorce, or, in some cases, to disown her parents. She has admitted to bullying her sister too.\n\n\\- she is currently going to counselling for anger issues, but I feel that these are just a symptom of another disorder. She has been going to counselling for various reasons since being in her late teens.\n\n\\- she said once that she is \"very, very arrogant\", loves talking about her appearance and often compliments herself in front of me, e.g. \"doesn't my hair/skin/outfit look great?\" I remember one Hallowe'en we went out and she spent a lot of the evening just talking about her outfit, it got quite tedious.\n\nThese are a few examples of how she can be.

I guess time  will tell whether or not something good or bad happens. :/\n\n\\-\n\n\\-\n\n\\_  \n\n\nSo this is ... a complete and utter mess.\n\nFirstly, I'm from the UK.\n\nBasically,  years ago I met this girl online from Cali. We'll call her \"M\" At the  time she was 17? coming up for her 18th, I was 20 at the time.\n\nWe  started just chatting and quickly became gaming friends. She was  literally like the female version of me. It's super adorable. I grew to  understand she had some problems with seizures stemming from something  when she was a baby but that didn't phase me.As time went on we  started to flirt innocently, growing closer and admitted we had feelings  for each other. (Completely just happened, I didn't expect to fall for  her). We exchanged gifts and I kept them all in a box in my room.\n\nAs  we talked more and more, she explained her past few bf's since 14, and  how she had been sexually abused and mentally broken her a few times. I  accepted all this and honestly seemed like I was the only one to even  tried to support/listen and understand everything.\n\nThis  is where it slowly started to get into mess 1. Obviously she lived 4.5K  miles away. Even though we hadn't met yet, we had spoken about me  flying over (I had family near her at the time over there so I could  stay between them when I went).\n\nAt the  same time, over in the UK, a girl professed her feelings for me (We'll  call her J), a girl who I used to have a crush on years before but never  made the move. I was so conflicted over both that I decided to explain  to M that I didn't want to get to a point I was flirting or playing both  (I hate any kind of cheating etc) and so I explained although I had  feelings for her, I wouldn't continue them at this time, however I would  love to still be friends, in the most polite and respectful manor I  could.\n\nShe took this extremely hard and  insta blocked me from everything, aswell as her few friends and family  that knew about me. Of course this took me by surprise at that age, but  eventually things relaxed and I ended up getting with J for nearly 3  years a while after all that happened.\n\nIt  was honestly a perfect relationship for the whole time, (though I won't  lie I had thought and wondered how M was doing just because of the  impact she had on my life).At one early morning about 1.5 years into  mine and J's relationship, M's best friend sent me a drunk message out  of the blue, saying she was dating an extremely abusive guy and that she  had bought my name up a few times asking for help.I tried looking M  up but she had still blocked me on everything, I had no way to get in  contact (her friend quickly went silent aswell). Again I moved on, abit  worried, but I continued on with my life.\n\nJust  over a year ago now, coming up to the 3 yeah mark of me and J, I found  out she was cheating, literally days after my mum had passed away from  illness. These two things aswell as having to become almost the solo  provider to keep our house (with me and my disabled brother) caused me  to spiral into such a dark depression.\n\n8  Months later, whilst cleaning out my room, I found all of M's stuff we  had gifted and I thought I'd just try search.... TaDa! She must have  made a new account on FB because there she was... a few years older,  slightly different but it was 100% her. I sent her a long email stating  if she'd like to chat and just catch up...\n\nWell, she saw it and we caught up everything that had happened over the years.She  was in multiple of bad relationships, she had moved out of her home and  moved back, gotten a quite good starter career job, and more.\n\nI  told her everything that happened in my life (My mum loved and wished  to meet her, so she was incredibly knocked and upset when I told her she  had passed).\n\nOver time we started to  talk more and more... and this time she booked flights to come see me  for two weeks towards the end of last year (after speaking nearly  everyday for that whole year).\n\nThis is the problem / help needed bit...\n\nBefore  she came over, she told me about one particular ex that she \"dated but  never met\", she had done something in America called a Adopt A Soldier  scheme. You basically send letters and are given someone who's an ex  soldier to become pen pals... Well, this got out of hand eventually. He  was 42/43 at the time (46 now I think).Won't lie, he's quite wealthy  from being in the army and his management job now, however is married  with 2/3 children. At first it was casual friends but then he started  sending gifts... expensive gifts - ipads, headsets, premium branded  sunglasses, guitar. Etc etc. Obviously this went onto sexual gifts in  return. She said she never met him personally tohugh and finally she  broke loose of the hold he had before we started talking (Guess where  this is going). We'll call this person \"S\" (she stated to him I will  admit that she said many times, if he didn't divorce his wife, they  would stop speaking. He promised many times.. and obviously he never  did)\n\nAnyhoo, skip forward a bit, we meet  up for the two weeks she's over here. It was magical, simple beyond  what the 3 years I was with J was like. We became sexual within the  first few days. Because of her past she had, had extreme sexual problems  through stress and being scared... there was none with me. It was  completely relaxed and on the second night she even cried her eyes out  she had never experienced something so amazing. (I'm a pretty good  person when someone says something in person, I had a weird gift of  being able to tell if it's truth or not &gt;.&lt;)\n\nAnyway,  (coming to an end now) She heads home and for the next few months we're  booking my trip over there (which would've been for this year) and  continued our relationship.\n\nWell. Just  after new years she has a seizure at work and is rushed to the hospital.  She was in a few days then discharged but the way she spoke I knew  something was.... off? different... Her parents (who by this time loved  me because I was so different to her ex's) pushed me aside with any  updates. Her friend kept making excuse after excuse on what was going  on.\n\nEventually I got a massively long break up message from M with so many loopholes and my 6th sense going off the grid.A  week later, finally we managed to skype and bought it all back down to  earth, started chatting again, she admitted her feelings were the same,  to which I said, get better first before our relationship picks up  again. And I basically helped her day to day with remembering all her  pills, documents, medical stuff etc as her brain memory was all over.  Day after her breakup message she also cancelled my flight out of having  the need to recover so they'd be no point to visit..!?\n\nSo we started talking everyday again....\n\nThing  is... she'd start talking about new york randomly every so often out  the blue, and how she felt like she was being pulled to move from where  she was currently. I took it as the after seizure affecting her mind.\n\nThen  the bomb dropped one day whilst we were skyping and her mum came in,  handed M a parcel saying \" it's from him... another one \". I questioned  it and M quickly blew it off. Then another time when we were screen  sharing on skype (she has her iphone hooked to her pc) a text message  from the named \"S\" person. Again quickly got blown off from that.\n\nBy  this time, I was sure somehow he was still in the picture. So I asked  about him and she admitted he has sent her lots of stuff since the  seizure however she told him to stop...\n\nWell,  this is now where it's blown up. Her sister, who I've been speaking to  about possibly coming over to Cali next year (I wanted to always visit  and hike around anyway) and she broke down explaining how M has been  behind my back for months now. This \"S\" guy, never stopped pestering  her, they'd met multiple times, he's usually book hotels and she'd say  when he travelled from New York (again he's slightly above average in  wealth). M's sister then sent me screenshots from M's mum and the sister  stating after the seizure he flew out to help her etc, and has been out  multiple times. Screenshots also say not to tell Me, as it'd break my  heart and they trust this guy because he's got money... etc.. (they  don't know about what he's been doing to M)\n\nSo her parents, or atleast M's mum is covering up S and M's \"relationship\".Well  M and the sister had a massive blow out just before she sent me all  this new info and basically it was stating from M that she will be  moving to New York soon (because S has asked her to), S has bought a  small apartment for them both and they're going to live happily ever  after. He's also going to divorce his wife and they're already planning  their future together, and there's nothing anyone can do about it  - and  proceeded to block her sister.\n\nNow. This is the whole mess.Since  last night, I've barely slept. I was googling around trying to find any  info on this S guy. I've currently got his name, some of his addresses I  think, part of his phone number and pictures of him from FB and Insta.  I've even got his current workplace.\n\nBasically,  the main detail I'm trying to find is his wife's number. I want to come  clean and explain everything to her. She apparently knows nothing of   M, and also thinks when S travels it's for work...Their kids are  also nearly M's age. It's a completely fucked up situation and although I  care about M, I just want her safe now. This guy is NOT safe. He is  manipulative, shady and a whole lot of other words.\n\nCould  anyone give me advice on what I can do as I've tried ringing Police in  USA and they stated that unfortunately because of their ages, there's  nothing they can do !? Even with me explaining M's medical life.\n\nHell, I'll even use a site to pay to find S's wife's number to get in contact if it means protecting M... :(!\n\nPlease.. Help.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

[F17 &amp; M18] \n\nMe and my ex boyfriend were together when i was around 14/15 years old for 9 months. before this time we were good friends. things escalated and we ended up having sex after around 3 months of being together(i know it was young but being stupid and thinking you\u2019re in love is a funny thing) but after we did the deed i cried for days and something just didn\u2019t feel right. i wasn\u2019t comfortable with what happened and couldn\u2019t bring myself to talk about it. the next time we met he initiated it again and unfortunately i gave in but i cried during this time and he did not stop. he seemed to feel bad after both times and consoled me but i wasn\u2019t sure why i cried. after that we did not have sex again. \n\nAlso he used to insult me occasionally, once telling me he hopes i get hit by a bus, and saying that i date everyone i can. calling me a slut, bitch, cunt, every insult you can think of. he never apologised and never seemed to show any remorse. he would ignore me for days if he liked, until he felt like talking again. \n\nAlso he had a female friend i was suspicious of. they went on a date which i only was informed of the night before, and he then posted a photo of only her on socials. nowhere online did it say me and him were together\n\ni asked him to remove it and he didn\u2019t saying it meant nothing and he only wanted to be with me, but he messaged this girl all the time, spent more time with her than me and hid his texts from her. i broke up with him to find a week later they were together and having sex making me question if he was cheating on me with her.\n\naround 7/8ish months went by and he texts me on snapchat saying he misses me he is really unhappy and admitted he was still with this girl but he didn\u2019t want to be with her anymore. he said things to me like \u2018i want to be with you, but if i break it off with her she might do something stupid\u2019 or \u2018i can\u2019t dump her, she might kill herself\u2019 ect ect, he told me everything a girl wants to hear that he had changed, he\u2019d never gotten over me and regretted how he acted. eventually he broke it off with her and we got back together.\n\nthis relationship lasted 3 months but throughout the course of it he seemed to be worse than before. he had sleepovers with girls at his house and wouldn\u2019t invite me, would ignore me the whole night. a snapchat was posted one of the nights of one of the  girls sitting on his lap touching his face which friends preceded to message me with \u2018are you okay with that\u2019 ect and i decided to leave it till the morning. i confronted him after they had left and he told me what i saw was not correct, said i was lying and trying to ruin his friendship with his \u2018best friend\u2019 said i was being clingy and jealous of a friendship, and eventually told his best friend all about it and she then messaged me saying what i had seen wasn\u2019t what had happened and had a go at me for causing trouble between their friendship. \n\nhowever i had always been suspicious of her as he had a photograph of her in his room(none of me or us) she was his cover photo on facebook(again just her) and he always posted her on socials, he would hang out with her and not me ect. \n\nalongside this, possibly the worst of all, whenever we were alone he would initiate sex and even if i declined he would push and push until i gave in. i am a small girl 5\u20191 and he is much taller and bigger than me. i would ask if we could chill and watch a movie and he would move my hand onto his crotch and if i tried to move away he would grab it and hold it there. he would use his own hands to move mine to please him. he would not stop touching me until i said fine. i was always silent when this happened, never said a word, never did any of the work. i didn\u2019t want the harassment anymore and usually after i gave him what i wanted he would leave. he would also try to pressure me into anal sex by trying to insert his penis which i repeatedly said no to however he would still try until i physically had to push him off me. \n\nto add - on my 16th birthday we went to the zoo, another ex messaged me saying he wanted me back, but i declined. i offered for my boyfriend to read the texts but he said no. on the way back home, i went to grab some drinks and he went through my phone and texts with this ex to try to find out if i was cheating. when i broke up with him a few days later( i couldn\u2019t be with him anymore)  he admitted to me that he went through my phone because he didn\u2019t trust me. is this because he was unfaithful? or something else \n \ni just want to know if this is the makings of an abusive person, if i should be worried about anyone else he gets involved with, and was it abuse? i have developed mild paranoia since being with him and i\u2019m unsure if it stemmed from him or myself. \n\nThanks \n\nTDLR: My ex boyfriend insulted me regularly, lied to me, manipulated my thoughts about myself, lowered my self esteem, sexually harassed me(was it worse than this?) was this any kind of abuse?

A little over a week later and here is my update:\n\nThis is a weird thing to be excited about, but I hit a new milestone today.  It appears I have passed through the 'hoovering' stage, and now my Nex is at the point where she blames me for a lot of the problems.  I realize that NC is obviously the way to go here, but I have decided that, while she moves her stuff out of our place, I will remain in contact.  I understand the risks/dangers and I have accepted that.  Truthfully, when she was still hoovering me, it was very hard to stand firm on my decision, but now that the hoovering has stopped and now that she tries to blame me for everything, it really feels like a weight has been lifted.  All of a sudden, my doubts all disappeared, and I feel validated, and it feels great!\n\nIt's truly odd to hear do a complete 180 right before my eyes.  For the first four or five days, she is literally begging me to take her back, promising me the world, and willing to bend over backwards for me, and then, all of a sudden, the mood shifts and now I'm to blame for all the problems.  Nobody flips that quickly, unless they were lying the entire time about 'changing' and 'being a better person'.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to thank everyone (from the bottom of my heart) for your kind words and messages in my last post.  I know we are all strangers here, but I feel so connected and close to this community.  I appreciate everyone taking the time to listen to me, and I hope my words can inspire and give hope to someone else in a similar position.  My next milestone will likely be once I go NC, which likely won't be for a few weeks.  I realize she is probably just drawing out the move out process to remain in contact and to try and buy time to hoover me back, but I have decided to just let this play out as she sees fit, and not really try and butt heads with her over something I don't really care about.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

And when I say a **lot**, I mean at the very least eight hours every single day, grinding the same three missions over and over and over and over.

She built a little gang that we used to play with (all guys), and she'd flirt away with them and cause all sorts of drama, which eventually destroyed the group altogether. I'd come home from work hoping for a welcoming hug, and every time she'd be sat there on that sofa playing that bloody game with the whole gang.

I got diagnosed with PTSD from all the violent incidents and have been working through all of that in therapy.\n\nHowever, last night, I checked his instagram (I KNOW I KNOW) WHY DID I DO THAT? anyways, he is doing some hoovering tactics (ofc) but mostly his new life just seems really really fucking sad. I've never seen a grown ass 33 year old man try so hard to be cool and trendy. I just can't believe how fucking lame he is and how I didn't see it before. He is the perfect example of Mr. Sensitive in the Lundy Bancroft book. His instagram is filled with him talking about relationship attachment styles, and the women's march, completely disregarding the fact that he has physically abused THREE women that I know of, including myself. I just can't believe I fell for that bullshit before. It's so obvious how annoying and fake and manipulative his whole life is. He also tries to post naked pictures of himself and he's still trying to bang 20 year old college girls, mostly because they are the only ones that would fall for that shit. He's just...so gross. I can see his future of being a really lonely gross old pervy man. You'd think I'd be happy but I'm not. It's mostly sadness combined with disbelief that I dated him/almost married him. I don't miss him anymore, that's for sure but damn I can't even gloat. I feel just sad for him and stupid for myself...and a little grateful that I got out.\n\nHas anyone else felt this way?

I do not desire him in anyway. I used to keep distant social media tabs out of fear making sure there was no signs of him preparing for baby.\n\nHe made me lose everything but this post isn\u2019t about that. It\u2019s the fact that he targeted a vulnerable empath who is still an empath. \n\nI feel bad that he\u2019ll never likely know true lasting happiness and his life is like this deflective formula and he just doesn\u2019t get or connect with things like love or know how to feel for others.  \n\nHe definitely dealt with abuse from a successful mother growing up and he never has felt like he\u2019s lived up to her expectations.  He watched his loving loyal father feeling emasculated growing up although his dad has come to terms with his role in his wife\u2019s life and they are happily married as far as he says and honestly his dad is the most stable person in his family.  He told his family about the baby and his dad was the only one who was excited and wasn\u2019t upset that I\u2019m a white woman and the baby was going to be mixed and his father tried to convince his mother it was wrong that she resented his son and future grandson for something as trivial as blood and genes he shares...  \n\nMy narc didn\u2019t fool me into thinking he was excited to be a dad or that he was excited to have a kid. I saw right through him knowing his kid was just an object to him, something I possess that is half his and he must have ownership and control of the baby. Mostly he is worried about his image and didn\u2019t want to come off as a dead beat dad if he decided not to take part in fatherhood. \n\nWhen I still talked to him he used to try manipulate me into keeping it secret telling the community we were in it was someone else\u2019s even though everyone knew we were together.  I am not a good liar.  I could never get on his terms with his lying and image orientated ideas.\n\nEveryone knew he impregnated me and I was keeping it before I had to cancel all my gigs, quit my job, and completely disappeared. This angered him he was so aggressive after people were holding him accountable. He started to aggressively intimidate me even though we weren\u2019t together, he would act like he owned me while bringing his dates into my work and publicly slandering me while I needed to run a bar alone. I hadn\u2019t been beat by him since we broke up but he started to hurt me physically in covert ways again, he\u2019d pin me in corners when I wasn\u2019t expecting it, slam me against walls and demand things, grab my face or neck, slap me, squeeze me while I begged him to stop and told him it hurt and he\u2019d tell me not to make a scene and since I refused to see him anywhere this all would happen when I was at work thus making me have to quit my job. He\u2019d even wait for me outside of work to torture  me telling me not to make a scene until I started asking a doorman or willing patron I trusted to walk me to my car. \n\nAnyway. He\u2019s dangerous in my opinion. He has a public domestic violence record. But he\u2019s incredibly charming and only people who get close to him see this side.  \n\nHe wanted me to let him dad without applying for paternity on his terms just to see if he liked it. Lmao that\u2019s not reality! It\u2019s not how it works to be a parent at all! Before I went no contact I was clear that if he contacted me or tried to find me I would call the police and file a restraining order. A lot of my abuse was recorded by doctors at least. I also assured him he has rights if he applies for paternity but I pray that he\u2019s so selfish he won\u2019t.  The only reason he would is pressure to look good but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s lied and slandered me to cut him off the hook of responsibility. He really tried to manipulate me to make amends and didn\u2019t give up til I blocked him every way possible. He sent out his comrades to check in on me until I isolated from literally everyone because I felt that was the only way.\n\nNow still after months i feel guilty no matter how much I shouldn\u2019t and I know that he likely won\u2019t and can\u2019t change. I mean this is this babies father. And sometimes as nasty as narcs are I just feel bad for them like they don\u2019t know any better and they are unaware of how destructive they are to others. I will not reach out as I\u2019ve dealt with enough pain from him and this pregnancy. this situation has been the hardest time in my life to get through. \n\nWhy do I pity him in spite of it all? Is it the hormones... I don\u2019t know... I\u2019ve always been very morally relative and try to empathize with all types of people.  I understand mental illness immensely well and I view narcissism as a disease just like my anxiety and depression and adhd. \n\nIt is most important to keep my baby and I safe so I\u2019m taking no action it\u2019s just thoughts that run through my head at times...", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u2019m an idiot for not realizing it wasn\u2019t a lack of opportunity or time that was keeping you from making an effort. \n\nI don't blame you for losing your feelings for me, and prioritizing your friends, or classes over a relationship, whatever it was, it\u2019s your life. What hurt is you blamed me for having high expectations, and let me run around for months thinking it was my fault and something *I* could change. You let me continuously try to make even more of an effort to change myself, and lower my expectations to sustain something that you just didn't care for anymore because the situational factors in *your* life had changed. \n\nOur break up was a real blow on my self-esteem, because for a while after I actually believed the long list of things you accused me of being:  irrational, crazy, clingy, trust issues, codependent, I claimed ownership of your time and imposed on your space by doing (actually thoughtful) things like visiting when you were sick. You claimed to be so logical and good at arguing, but those things you accused me of, you never used logic even once to convince me of them. It was the silent treatment, withholding affection, and emotional blackmail. When memories of us run through my head I'm beginning to realize more and more that I'm just as rational as you, if not more. It\u2019s never a healthy or normal relationship when one person is forced to take responsibility and apologize for 100% of the fights/arguments and I never should have let you gaslight me into believing otherwise. \n\nI still can\u2019t believe I let myself get into a situation where I was scared to speak because you would turn everything I brought up (calmly and rationally) into a much bigger argument/fight/stonewalling situation. And no, I wasn\u2019t oblivious to that, I know it wasn\u2019t me \u201cmaking things complicated\u201d, it was you throwing tantrums and personalizing and overreacting to every tiny thing I said. \n\nYou're wrong about me being a bad judge of character, and you're even more wrong about my trust issues. I was completely aware of your manipulativeness, (hell you told me you were manipulative on our first date, and I *did* dwell on that), but I *chose* to trust you and I *chose* to make excuses for it and convinced myself it was subconscious and not calculated. That was really stupid of me because I should have valued myself enough to realize that it didn\u2019t matter if it was unintentional, it\u2019s still equally wrong. I still don't believe that people are \"better\" or \"worse\" than each other, but I definitely deserved better *from* you. \n\nDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not victimizing myself like you say I always do. I\u2019m actually grateful for this experience with you. When I was with (my ex before you), I was a really horrible person, when I sensed apathy from him. With you I got to improve myself and now realize that I am capable of being disrespected without reciprocating the emotionally abusive dynamics. It\u2019s actually you I feel really sorry for in this situation, because that level of narcissism is going to be way, way harder to deal with than any of the issues you\u2019ve accused me of having. But hey, since you still aren\u2019t quite ready to believe you aren\u2019t infallible, and are going to continue thinking you\u2019re \u201calways right\u201d ...I might as well stroke your ego and admit, you are a great actor and liar. Good job convincing me you ever cared about me, I really did believe you there. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I live with my parents and their friend is dealing with a PTSD related domestic violence issue, so he's staying at the house. My parents went away so it's just me and their friend. He used to come over for parties. I've always liked him, would play with his daughters, and once he even gave me a couple joints to smoke with my friends when he figured out why 10 of us were leaving to go to the store. He gave me a ride home from work and told me his wife told him she loves him and wants him back at the house but hasn't rescinded the order of protection in 10 days. He talked about how he manipulates certain systems, like claiming he's a Jehovah's witness so he can avoid medical procedures like blood tests, and having a state citizenship in America instead of being a citizen of the United States of America so few laws apply to him. 34 arrests. Has gotten charged with mad domestic violence incidents but never convicted. Keeps mad guns. Used to be a heavy alcoholic. Has mad (actually really fun to hear) stories about illegal things he's done like stealing running cars for a quick joy ride. Said if the wife doesn't want him ok but he's a recently born again catholic and a 4th order knight of Colombus so he won't accept a divorce and he made it clear he would never let her be with anyone else no matter what. He's punishing his 17 y/o daughter for calling the cops by taking the money for the lawyers from money him &amp; wife saved for her 21st birthday. Doesn't think family should ever call the cops over anyone. Am I being hypersensitive because nex breakup was so recent or do these seem like red flags galore? Like I feel bad but I'm questioning everything thinking even his turn to religion is for show or to keep his marriage/family together. He's a disabled 911 survivor, a peace officer, a volunteer fireman, and he teaches at a church.

Honestly, I would love to be able to speak out loud about nex, because I haven't told a soul. In no way do I think this guy would do anything untoward. That's not my concern. He said he wouldn't tell my parents anything I told him in confidence because \"when I(he) give my word, I mean it.\" But he also just told me when he gets pulled over cops can see he has a gun permit he tells them for their safety that he rescinds his 4th amendment right so they can search him and his property. He flat out told me yeah that's just so he can get away with thc cartridges, which is a felony charge here, because who's going to search a disabled 911 survivor who's a fireman and a peace officer who just said that? Sooo...yeah. Sorry long post. I think he's funny. I want to have someone nonpartial to talk about nex with.

Full no contact since November as I still looked at his social media occasionally, but stopped doing so eventually, thankfully) is a former colleague who left our place of work suddenly in September to move back to his hometown to run for public office. His replacement at the office told a mutual friend yesterday that Nex had been using tinder at the end of our relationship right before he moved back home. Also, he told our other colleagues he was seeing a girl back home, casually, but was still on tinder a bunch at work. That week, our last week physically together, he took me out to a nice dinner and kept saying how much he wanted me to visit him in his hometown and how he\u2019s told his parents about me and wants me to finally meet them and his dog. That he would miss me the most when he moved. But at this same time he was telling his coworkers he was dating someone else? We even all went out together the Thursday of that week. And the someone else he claimed to be dating at that time is the new supply he started devaluing me for obviously in October.\n\nAfter we went out with his coworkers on that Thursday night, I went over to his house. I saw some Facebook messages between him and that girl who ended up being his new supply which he secured in October. The Facebook messages said things like \u201chey long time no talk! How\u2019s everything going for you?\u201d NOT the messages of people who are dating.... more like messages of people who just reconnected on Facebook.\n\nOur colleague also told my friend yesterday that Nex was known for being creepy to girls and sexually harassing them. Nex raped me and his ex, who reached out to his other ex and said he cheated on her too while they were dating and that he was overly sexual, which made her uncomfortable. His ex and I shared and compared stories and he gaslighted us into thinking his assaults on us was ok.\n\nI\u2019ve been going to therapy for a couple of months and am on Zoloft which I feel have really been helping.

It hasn't ever really been a problem, but it's sorta escalated a bit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome time ago she started to yell at my brother and me constantly about the stuff we never did, which would often annoy me because it felt like the things I was constantly helping her with were being overlooked (helping her with dinner, taking care of the dog 99.9% of the time, etc). It got so bad that she ended up leaving the house for most of the night. In turn, I got upset and ended up taking the dog on a long walk with my sleeves pulled back (it was like really cold; I was essentially  trying to freeze my arms)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the next few days, her and my stepfather told me the day before I took the ACT (Standardized test for colleges and stuff, in case someone doesn't know what it is) that \"If I didn't have the ACT my things would have already been packed.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've gotten sorta tired of her getting overly mad at me, so I sorta tried standing up for myself but it only made her angrier.

She just told me that \"While reading through my responses to the essay questions, she didn't really think I'd get an interview, but Jane's (Teacher I know at a similar local program that I didn't get into) response to them gave her more confidence\"\n\nWhich is something you shouldn't tell someone in general, until at least after the fact. But then again, one of my friends who got in said she thought someone told her that my mother was one of the reasons I didn't get into the original program and another said she honestly wouldn't be surprised.\n\nI started doubting the explanation mom gave to me and others (Probably to primarily make me feel better), which was essentially 'oh they had too many people and drew them outta a hat!'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry, I'm just really tired of this and I don't know what will happen if I don't get into the program. I don't enjoy going to my dads at all and normally I don't have *that* much interaction with mom, but enough. I just really felt like I needed to vent because I'm usually worried that my friends really don't want to listen to me complain about everything she does constantly (They tell me they don't, but I still worry).

We\u2019re both away from him and doing much better but thought I\u2019d share the poem here. \n\nI Was There\n\nI was there when you put your hands on her. \nI was there when your presence terrified her. \nI was there looking through the crack in my door,\nWondering what I could possibly do to make the fighting stop. \nI was there looking through the window while you argued outside.\nI was there when you hurt her physically and emotionally.\nI was there when you left for a few days because you didn't want to go to jail for domestic violence. \nI was there while she cried. \nI was there when she went to the hospital unsure of what the future holds.\nI was there when she said she still loved you.\nI was there always watching, always listening, always crying;\nTo scared to do something about it.\nI was there when you said you had never put your hands on a woman,\nAnd not once did I say you were lying.\nI was there every time you thought I wasn't,\nI know what you have done.\nI know you try to make her feel as if everything is her fault.\nI know you never take responsibility for your actions.\nI know she still believes everything is her fault because you told her so.\nI was there when you told her.\nI was there when she told me not to tell anyone what was going on because she didn't want anyone to know that she let a man hit her.\nI was there when she cried herself to sleep because she didn't think she was good enough for you,\nEven though you don't deserve her.\nI am here and she will forever carry the injuries you gave her.\nI am here and you still deny your actions, even to her.\nI am here and I can see she is still afraid of you, but she tries to hide it.\nI am here, trying to keep her from falling apart.\nI am here, but you never were.\nYou may have been here physically,\nBut mentally you left behind a monster who would hit a woman, \nAnd then deny it.\nI was there worried not only for her, but for those who may have been in the house that day.\nI was there when nothing could block out the angry shouts,\nOr the broken furniture,\nOr the cries. \nI was there, but was that enough?\n\n\nThis poem I wrote a couple weeks ago about how I felt about being abused. \n\nHelpless\n\nI sometimes close my eyes\nAnd feel his hands on me\nInside me\nThere\u2019s no escape\nIt\u2019s all I feel\nIt\u2019s all I see\nI can\u2019t erase the feel of him off me\nHelp me\nHelp me\nThey all seen something amiss\nNo one said anything\nNo one did anything \nNo one helped me\nNo one saved me\nI was helpless\nH\n E\n  L\n   P\n    L\n     E\n      S\n       S\nAnd no one did anything\n", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Thankfully there was nothing romantic about this one. Still, I imagine spending forty hours a week being targeted professionally by a narcissist isn\u2019t far off.\n\nI actually helped hire the guy when the team was still really small. I rooted for him after his spectacular interview performance. It seemed like he was a bit on the autism spectrum or something but I got the impression he was highly competent. I thought I had a pretty good sense of a person\u2019s level of self esteem and I was convinced. However I did detect a bit of arrogance, and I gathered that he had the expectation of being viewed as very intelligent. (Unrecognized red flag #1)\n\nWe even texted back and forth about the role, and boy was he a talker. He was awfully friendly for someone I had just met... you know? (Unrecognized red flag #2)\n\nWithin his first few days he came up with some very pretty technical designs. I mean, they looked perfect. They were intended to replace stuff we had come up with thus far and I figured since he was so competent that he was doing us a favor. He emphasized that we all should contribute to the design, that we should all have a say in what we build... but the design was polished like something out of a textbook, so how could we feel comfortable messing with it at all? (Unrecognized Red flag #3)\n\nA few weeks in, he contributed some work and I reviewed it. I found some errors and remarked on them. Boy, that did not go over well. He stopped opening up his work for review after that. Oopsie! (Unrecognized red flag #4)\n\nI started working on a big project of my own design for a while. It was going well and was totally transparent to the organization. I demoed it a few times and it was well received. After a few weeks he decided he needed to build the exact same thing I was building, but differently. That was when I started to suspect he was trying to pull the rug out from under me. (Unrecognized red flag #5)\n\nOf course since he was in a higher position and paid more than me and upper leadership was convinced of his brilliance, his work became preferred for the requirement. To his credit, what he built was cool and worked, but it was very sloppy and no one could understand it. I was upset about having to abandon a month of work, but he seemed oblivious to this... even unempathetic. (Unrecognized red flag #6)\n\nNow, as you might expect from his reaction to my earlier review of his work, he started making our boss (a decent guy) angry with the lack of transparency. He seemed to expect special freedom to not report on progress nor make his work accessible for collaboration. (Unrecognized red flag #7)\n\nAs with his initial designs, he told the team we were welcome to contribute to what he was doing. Oh joy! Well I tried for a while but he restricted my contributions to very minor things like \u201ccleaning up\u201d things. Work you might expect a \u201cjunior\u201d of my profession to do. So after a while I just started to avoid him, working on other things such as the actual product requirements.\n\nAt some point I learned that he had been ostracized at his last company. (Red flag #99) Having seen all his annoying behavior I was glad to hear that at least his last company could put him in his place.\n\nI haven\u2019t mentioned one of the worst things yet. He wanted me to think he was my friend throughout all this. He would constantly ask me \u201chow are you doing?\u201d Also he could never, ever admit being wrong about anything. When I would start telling him something he would always act like he already knew what I was going to say. (Red flag #999)\n\nThis was torture pretty much. He had turned our team culture into shit. I didn\u2019t enjoy going into work anymore. I had to know what the hell was wrong with this guy. Then I found the Wikipedia page on NPD and...\n\nBam, it hit me. Textbook narcissist! He fit every single criterion.\n\nAfter I came to understand this about this monster, I felt empowered and a lot less frustrated. I knew how to deal with him. Basically I just ignored him and told him nothing. When he\u2019d come over and try to make me feel bad and pretend to care about me, I would remember what I\u2019d learned and just smile and keep working. This INFURIATED him.\n\nActually I think he knew I was onto him. After I started doing this he started keeping to himself, probably plotting some shit to do to me. But at that point my boss was onto him too. That\u2019s because I told my boss to go look up NPD, and my boss did so, and the revelation hit him like a ton of bricks just like it did for me. Both of us have since left the company, and for both of us the narcissist and the company\u2019s tolerance of him was a factor. Our departure set off a chain of resignations by others. Amazing what one man can accomplish when he sets his mind to it!\n\nThere you have it folks. A pure narcissist at work.

It's the third time now in a span of less than a year. \n\nWhen we first strates dating/got back together those two times he would be all nice and caring, would give me enough attention would admire my ambitions and goals and assure that I'll get there. Then a month passes and the fights start. I'll explain our last two months together, because those are the times I recall the best, but previous times were very similar and had almost the same issues.\n\nAfter a month or so being in a nice relationship he starts claiming that I don't do shit in uni even though we made an agreement that we'd both spend at least an hour a day studying even if we don't really need to have anything done. That wasn't a good enough proof to him that I'm taking my education seriously and that I'm putting effort into it. (Yes, he has a job in his field already, but his grades are not that good either)\nHe also starts claiming that I don't have any interests. When I prove to him that I have, he then says that they are childish (Art, world politics, other issues in the world). When I ask him to name his interests he says that that's not the point and that the point is that mine are childish. (I'd like to add that he was the one who took me to a museum five days ago and said that I didn't like it and I have no interest in life, because I was a bit fed up when he was reading a children's book for 15 minutes while we were in there)\nHe then goes round and round saying how important it is to talk everything out after a fight and fully resolve it, yet when he's done fighting he just shuts down and doesn't really talk about it, says he doesn't want to, says his head hurts so he just doesn't think about it. When I try to not think about a fight, he says that I'm running aeay from the problem, when he does it - it's just normal, because he doesn't want to feel worse. Only way to get him to talk is to ask him to meet up. I'd like to add that every shut down of his makes me go insase due to the previous breakups, I end up thinking that this means that he's leaving me again tomorrow, then I get massive anxiety, can't sleep or do anything else and he's fully aware of it. Sometimes he says that he feels horrible that he makes me feel this way, yet doesn't do anything to change it.\nHe says that I don't take my health seriously, because I don't fully follow keto (I have a glutten problem and I try to avoid gluten products as much as I can), tho he doesn't follow keto himself, every fight is a good enough reason for him to shove his mouth full of bread products.\n\n\nNow I have difficulty understanding if this is actual abuse, the demands getting to the point of impossible, because every action I take to fulfil one of his demands goes unnoticed and if I try to point it out, then the action is dissmised. Claims that our views of the future doesn't allign, tho it perfectly did when we started talking again. Claims that I have no interests, tho I did a month ago. Claims that I have no hobbies, because I don't like physical activities (he doesn't do any of it either). \nWhen I'm writing this out it seems that the dude is at least a douchebag if he's not abusive, but 15 mins later I know I'll be questioning my judgement and wondering if there's actually something wrong with me.\n\nSo please, does this look like abuse to you and if it does, how can I cope with this, how can I fully understand it at all times so I don't end up idealising him again and thinking that I'm the piece of shit that's not enough here?

How can I help her?", "author": "foxfunk", "self_text": "Me and my friend \u201cClara\u201d met at university and we\u2019ve been very close since. We lived together for 2 years so we know each other very well and we message each other throughout the day, every day. I see her less frequently but we try to meet once a month if we can. \n\nThis time last year Clara started dating an acquaintance of her\u2019s called \u201cRon\u201d. Initially she\u2019d not liked Ron physically or otherwise, but he pursued the SHIT out of her until she caved and went on a date. The relationship developed really quickly which worried me at first because Clara always wears her heart on her sleeve, and I\u2019d not met this guy. Another reason for concern was that Ron was living in Spain for his studies, so they were entering a long-distance relationship. Ron is fluent in Spanish but Clara speaks none, and we\u2019re all originally from England. A massive T&amp;C of the relationship was that the distance was *temporary*, because Ron was sick of Spain and graduating in the Summer. \n\nAfter a few months I grew less worried, because Ron seemed really attentive and caring towards Clara. He was constantly sending her loving messages, they\u2019d FaceTime until late at night and they\u2019d send letters. She would visit him in Spain when she got the chance, and he came home to see her when he could. He got her lovely thoughtful gifts and they made plans for what they would do when he returns to England. I was so happy for Clara because she was able to finally trust guys again after having her self esteem crippled by past relationships. \n\nRon came back to England around September last year, as planned, and this is where everything went to shit. They seemed to argue whenever they saw each other in person now he was back in the UK. His family were cold and unwelcoming. It came to a head after a month where Ron announced he was going back to Spain because he couldn\u2019t find his dream job in England. Clara was devastated because she\u2019d already invested so much time and money into the relationship. She\u2019d worked a job literally wiping people\u2019s arsed so she could fly to see him and he was unwilling to stick with a good job here because it wasn\u2019t *perfect*. They agreed to try and make things work and he promised he would return as soon as possible, hopefully within 2/3 months. \n\nSince then things have been awful and I\u2019m really worried. Here are a few of my concerns:\n\n\u2022 Ron is constantly convincing Clara she\u2019s \u201cmad\u201d or \u201coverreacting\u201d whenever she voices concerns. A typical response to anything she says that he doesn\u2019t like is \u201cyou\u2019re hilariously overreacting\u201d or \u201cmy friends would think you\u2019re being a total psycho\u201d. It started off like \u201clol you\u2019re being silly\u201d and now its more like \u201cstop this you\u2019re being ridiculous\u201d.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s displayed signs of anger and aggression towards Clara. When Clara was having a panic attack Ron started shaking her and yelling in her face to calm down. He yelled at her when she forgot to take her pill and accused her of trying to get pregnant to \u201ctrap him\u201d. She\u2019s constantly walking on egg shells and having to second guess his reactions to whatever she says. \n\n\u2022 He is manipulative and uses their distance as a way of punishing her. If she brings up an issue she has or says anything remotely negative he will ignore her for hours or whole days. She can say something as simple as \u201cI\u2019ve had a bad day\u201d wanting comfort and he will say \u201cI don\u2019t need this right now Clara what are you trying to do to me\u201d. If she says something he doesn\u2019t like he\u2019ll delay seeing her or shorten the number of days they spend together. The worst was last month when they had an argument and he sent her about 4 messages in 3 weeks. \n\n\u2022 Ron guilt trips her for spending time with friends. He will passive aggressively tell her to enjoy herself and have a good time. He sent her about 10 missed calls when she was round my apartment (after a family member of mine had died, and she\u2019d told him this). She went to meet with a male friend (who is a homosexual anyway) for breakfast and he flipped his shit at her out of jealousy. He says he doesn\u2019t like me because I \u201cput ideas in (her) head\u201d, when I\u2019m just listening and trying to be supportive of her. He gets mad if she messages me or her mum while she\u2019s FaceTiming him. He says he hates me when he\u2019s met me once for 3 minutes? \n\n\u2022 He has the majority of the power and control which is really fucked up. Her life revolves around him but he\u2019s always out with friends, at work, going for meals etc. He promised her he would be coming back to England at the beginning of their relationship and now he\u2019s backtracked saying he never intended on it. He\u2019d been planning for months where they\u2019d live in England. Now he\u2019s saying she\u2019s \u201cholding him back\u201d and that she\u2019s selfish because she won\u2019t move to Spain (which is nuts cause she speaks no Spanish and wants to remain in the UK). He says she\u2019s ruining career opportunities for him and says she doesn\u2019t want him to succeed. She\u2019s welcomed him into her life but he\u2019s not introduced her to friends and he\u2019s always vague about what he\u2019s up to. \n\n\u2022 He\u2019s cold and shows no affection now. Instead of cute morning messages he now sends sexual fantasies or short messages you\u2019d expect from a distant friend. Its like he\u2019s completely changed as a person, his attitude is unrecognisable. \n\n\u2022 He uses possessive jealous language all the time like \u201cyou\u2019re mine whether you like it or not\u201d, \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand seeing you with someone other than me\u201d, \u201c \u201cyou\u2019re my girl and no one else\u2019s\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d kill anyone who looks at you\u201d. He\u2019s started fights in clubs with men who have just looked at her. It might seem a little romantic in some ways to some people but it just feels so creepy to me. Its like he sees Clara as a possession and not a person. He can\u2019t stand anyone else having her but he doesn\u2019t treat her with any respect or show any affection? He says \u201cI can\u2019t believe anyone would make you feel worthless\u201d and when she says he does he flips out. \n\n\u2022 His behaviour has made Clara really ill. She\u2019s lost a lot of weight through vomiting and not eating properly. She was in hospital about 18 months ago for anaemia so I\u2019m really worried she\u2019s going to end up hospitalised again. She\u2019s talking about wanting to hurt and punish herself which is nothing like her, she\u2019s usually so vibrant and happy. She says she\u2019s been ill because of how she\u2019s being constantly let down then comforted again. \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m missing a lot. Essentially Clara is confused and heartbroken. She feels like she\u2019s grieving for the person she thought she knew but also praying that this is just a phase. Her self esteem is being crushed again and she has such little confidence right now. She can see how bad his behaviour is but she hasn\u2019t got the strength to properly tell him or to leave him. He\u2019s going to South America for 6 months soon too which further proves he has no intention of coming back to England. I think he\u2019s a selfish narcissist and that he\u2019s lured her in then revealed his true colours. He so clearly just wants a trophy girlfriend who\u2019s easy and compliant he even jokes about it. \n\nI\u2019m terrified that he\u2019ll grind away at her confidence until she agrees to move to another country for him against her will. All she talks about at the moment is Ron and the problems she\u2019s having with him, its about 90% of what she talks about with me.  I have no clue what else to say because I feel I\u2019ve been saying all I can to try and support her and convince her to have some self-respect (without being too forceful). What else can I say and do to help her? \n\nTl;dr \n\nMy best-friend is in a long-distance relationship which has turned toxic and I am struggling with how to help and support her.

It's the third time now in a span of less than a year. \n\nWhen we first started dating/got back together those two times he would be all nice and caring, would give me enough attention would admire my ambitions and goals and assure that I'll get there. Then a month passes and the fights start. I'll explain our last two months together, because those are the times I recall the best, but previous times were very similar and had almost the same issues.\n\nAfter a month or so being in a nice relationship he starts claiming that I don't do shit in uni even though we made an agreement that we'd both spend at least an hour a day studying even if we don't really need to have anything done. That wasn't a good enough proof to him that I'm taking my education seriously and that I'm putting effort into it. (Yes, he has a job in his field already, but his grades are not that good either)\n\n\nHe also starts claiming that I don't have any interests. When I prove to him that I have, he then says that they are childish (Art, world politics, other issues in the world). When I ask him to name his interests he says that that's not the point and that the point is that mine are childish. (I'd like to add that he was the one who took me to a museum five days ago and said that I didn't like it and I have no interest in life, because I was a bit fed up when he was reading a children's book for 15 minutes while we were in there)\n\n\nHe then goes round and round saying how important it is to talk everything out after a fight and fully resolve it, yet when he's done fighting he just shuts down and doesn't really talk about it, says he doesn't want to, says his head hurts so he just doesn't think about it. When I try to not think about a fight, he says that I'm running aeay from the problem, when he does it - it's just normal, because he doesn't want to feel worse. Only way to get him to talk is to ask him to meet up. I'd like to add that every shut down of his makes me go insane due to the previous breakups, I end up thinking that this means that he's leaving me again tomorrow, then I get massive anxiety, can't sleep or do anything else and he's fully aware of it. Sometimes he says that he feels horrible that he makes me feel this way, yet doesn't do anything to change it.\n\n\nHe says that I don't take my health seriously, because I don't fully follow keto (I have a glutten problem, so does he, and I try to avoid gluten products as much as I can), tho he doesn't follow keto himself, every fight is a good enough reason for him to shove his mouth full of bread.\n\n\nNow I have difficulty understanding if this is actual abuse, the demands getting to the point of impossible, because every action I take to fulfil one of his demands goes unnoticed and if I try to point it out, then the action is dissmised. Claims that our views of the future doesn't allign, tho it perfectly did when we started talking again. Claims that I have no interests, tho I did a month ago. Claims that I have no hobbies, because I don't like physical activities (he doesn't do any of it either). \n\n\nWhen I'm writing this out it seems that the dude is at least a douchebag if he's not abusive, but 15 mins later I know I'll be questioning my judgement and wondering if there's actually something wrong with me.\n\nSo please, does this look like abuse to you and if it does, how can I cope with this, how can I fully understand it at all times so I don't end up idealising him again and thinking that I'm the piece of shit that's not enough here?

This is not the case, however, when it comes to anyone outside of the people he likes. For example, if I were to tell him that my co-worker or my mother had said or done something ill-natured to me, he will be able to recognize why I see it that way and come to my defense. If it is something he has done - or his family- these rose colored glasses come on and literally every excuse in the book for why I could be misunderstanding the situation comes out of his mouth. There is an adamant refusal to validate any kind of inference I make about the intentions of the action, despite there being evidence to support it. It's implied that unless I can **prove** what he or his family has intended (by reading minds, I guess?), he will not give my feelings much consideration.\n\nWhen I have tried to point this out to him -probably a mistake, I realize now - he says that he has not been doing that and looks at me like I'm crazy for not realizing how supportive he's been. It's causing me to feel so insecure about my own state of mind and I constantly doubt my perception of things and have to constantly ask others if I am somehow taking a situation and twisting it into something other than what is actually going on. I try to be as objective as I can, and no one has told me yet that I am likely misinterpreting things - other than him.\n\nWe have been having the same problems for awhile now; problems that he insists he has been working on and I just ignore his efforts. Our main issue has been with his mother, who tried to manipulate my bf into providing for her financially while she sunk herself deeper into debt \"working\" for  pyramid scheme. I have made other posts about that in the past, if you care to know the details. Realizing I was exposing her actions to my bf and preventing him from giving in to her, she started this smear campaign where she fabricates things in order to convince other family members that I am this bad person.\n\nMy bf told me that I just don't acknowledge what he does to help fix a problem unless he does it entirely the way I want him to. But if there has been no progress, the issues with his family are getting increasingly ridiculous, and he seemingly has no problem with his family being deceptive and acting in ways that they do because he still interacts with them as if everything is great....how exactly can I feel like he is supporting me through this?\n\nAm i in the wrong here? If I am, I would really like advice. I don't want to be the one causing issues. I just need to know if this is gaslighting because his denial of almost everything I think, and him just requiring me to lay out a super detailed account of why I believe I am being treated a particular way makes me wonder if he's blind to certain things or trying to keep me from feeling validated. Or if I'm just misunderstanding everything, which I'm less inclined to think due to people outside of his family being able to see certain red flags. It's so confusing when you really think there's no way you're imagining things and someone repeatedly makes you second guess your feelings....", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We visited each other approx 6 times over a whole year. The last time I was there he had treated me very strangely, and I was questioning his behaviour. When I returned home, he was suspiciously quiet online and barely talking to me. Two weeks later he is arrested for child sexual abuse.\n\nHis daughter was the one to contact me, and who made the claims. She said hewas a sick and horrible man and had to put a stop to him before I got hurt or my son. He eventually got in contact with me after he was released on bail. The whole situation is weird and fucked up. None of it made sense, and what both sides were telling me didn't add up. I decided to block all parties involved for my own mental health. The last straw was his daughter calling me at work, telling me that he has a new gf that looks exactly like me, and they needed to confirm I wasn't with him. Like, that just seemed WAY beyond appropriate behaviour for what was going on, plus I live thousands of miles away! Then he called me threatening to have me arrested because I'm a \"key witness\" but refused to have a lawer contact me! Every call, or message from either side was trying to lure me back there to \"prove\" something for them! Then two days ago, his daughter sends my Dad (who knows nothing about this) a huge message detailing everything, claiming I'm still with \"E\", sending him drugs and meeting with him! That my son is in danger! Of course, they knew my Dad would flip out, and he did, and threatened to kick me out, threatened to take my son away. Demanded go know WHY he was being sent this!\n\nIn the end, looking at everything, the whole situation has become very \"cult\" like. I've been gone for 4 months, and they are trying EVERYTHING to get me to come back. They have threatened to have me fired (lucky my boss know everything and they are ignoring calls about this), they have tried to lure me back in with jealousy, and now they are trying to use people in my own life against me! Why would a 16 year old girl, claiming to have been sexually abused by her father, be contacting MY father and telling him anything? And she even tried to do this with my mom! Not once has anyone tried to officially contact me by mail, which they ALL have my mailing address. They also have not tried to officially contact me by phone, it's always through some fake number messaging app. None of what I u derstand to be proper procedure has been followed, and makes me suspicious of everyone involved!\n\nIn the beginning, I 100% believed what I was told by his daughter because that's just something I would never doubt from a child! But then they started insisting that I was somehow involved, even though the incident she claimed happened YEARS before I met any of them! Not only that, but she didn't give me any info on investigators to talk to, lawyers or even her mom! If this was serious, why wasn't I being contacted or talked to by another adult! Then his \"mistresses\" started messaging me trying to convince me he was some sexually crazed psychopath. And these two women had lived with him for 11 years and 5 years, yet they witnessed nothing? They were off the hook, but my testimony was important? Trying to get me to contact investigators again. After all this, it just seemed so suspicious! Nothing was happening in any logical sensible way!\n\nAnyways, I think I dodged getting sucked into a mini cult, especially how they are acting, trying to lure me back in. I was gonna be the 3rd woman, but I think he wanted me as the \"matriarch\" as the other two women were there to look after kids and be his personal assistant. I had been offered the exact life I had always wanted, he was making all my dreams come true, and I got suckered in. I'm just glad I was smart enough to see the signs and break the spell.

Fast forward through the years my parents would fight but their fighting was abusive. The father would threatened my mother and tell her she is an idiot, a piece of shit, etc. He would scream and there would be no arguing with him. Anytime any of us did anything wrong we would yelled and told me could not do anything. If I so much as dropped a fork I would be screamed at. If I fell down, I would be told I'm an idiot. \n\nEven when I had friends come over my father would disapprove. Never would he show his real self when other people were around though. He'd always act like everything was perfect and we were a perfect little family. Recently I've started arguing with him more and more, I'm 25 keep in mind. My mother barely defends herself because she knows that it won't do anything. He doesn't hit anyone anymore.

I made myself believe that dating was a waste of time, and that I should only be with someone who I am super serious about.  The problem here is that I didn't know what I wanted.  Not only that, I put a lot of pressure on myself to 'make this one work' for fear of it being a wasted relationship.\n* Relationships can be work, but they can also be a lot of fun.  This is something that I believe to be true, but have yet to experience it myself (having been in only one relationship with a Narcissist).  I was told by many people how 'hard' relationships are, and how much 'work' is involved.  Because of this mindset, I guess I felt like the bad times were just normal relationship troubles and that we just needed to work on them together.\n* The \"one\" for you doesn't exist.

It can happen within the blink of an eye, with no forewarning at all. Sometimes I feel like he does it on purpose, be nice to make me let down my guard, and then once he's gained my trust, he strikes. It's for this reason that these episodes catch me so off-guard, and they are so disorienting because I previously thought everything was fine.\n\nAnyway, throughout the months working with him, I have learned that if I react to his attacks with hurt, frustration, or anger, basically any emotion at all, it just fuels him. So I've learned to use the grey rock method, and act like nothing is affecting me. When I do this, he will typically go at me harder for a minute, but then he backs right down and switches to this creepy, sycophantic niceness. \n\nThis happened today. We had been getting along fine and everything was on schedule. He comes over to my office and starts speaking to me very condescendingly, out of nowhere, asking me why I chose to make this or that decision. I was caught totally off-guard and after a minute of digesting what was happening, I was so, so close to lashing out at him. I was really going to let him have it. But then I thought to myself, if I do this, it's just going to give him the reaction he wants and it will give him ammunition to paint me as crazy or emotional. So, I grey rocked him. I was completely unemotional and answered only with facts. I didn't waver. That's when he switched to the creepy niceness, and then, just like that, the whole episode was over. \n\nWhat I'm upset about is the fact that there was another manager who overheard this interaction, and I'm feeling really ashamed that I let my boss speak to me the way he did within earshot of someone else. I'm afraid that because I used grey rock and didn't call him out on his behavior and tone, it has made me look weak, like I couldn't stand up for myself. But the other manager doesn't understand that this is how I have to deal with my boss, because he doesn't work directly with him or even near him, so he doesn't understand how he is and how he has to be handled.\n\nI'm just feeling embarrassed and like I was made a fool of. Of course, I don't know if the other manager is thinking any of this. He may be thinking that my boss is a complete psycho (true) and that I shouldn't have to work for someone like that.

I'm sorry if this is too long or whatever, I'm literally just pouring my thoughts out but also I suck at venting because I feel overdramatic and stupid.\n\nAnyway, in October 2018, my boyfriend's best friend sexually assaulted me. We had been friends for four years, he is about 6-7 years older than me (I'm early 20's) and had known me since I was 19. I saw him like an older brother - he helped me and my boyfriend grow so much. We had kind of been drifting apart but my boyfriend planned this big camping trip. He was so excited.\n\n\\[tw: description of assault\\]\n\nThe night we were there, I got too fucking drunk - everyone did. I was having a horrible time, the best friend's girlfriend was being nasty to me all night and I just felt left out. I stayed up after everyone had gone to bed, but I was pretty incapacitated. I don't know if anyone will believe me (if you can't tell, I was blamed by almost everyone for this). Best friend stayed up too with me. We were just talking, I don't know - my memory gets spotty. I remember laying on my back, waking up and I was staring at the sky. I asked best friend how long I'd been asleep - he said 30 minutes. I sat up and then laid forward on my knees staring at the fire. I think at one point he started kissing my neck, but I was so out of it I don't know if that's real. Then his hand was in my pants, groping me. Then he put his fingers inside me. My boyfriend had apparently been watching the whole time (???) and I guess thought it was consensual. It was so fucking traumatic, everyone was screaming and I got kicked in the stomach at one point.\n\n\\[tw: description over\\]\n\nThe next day when we had to go get our stuff, no one would look at me. It was obvious everyone thought I was disgusting. When me and my boyfriend went to our couple's counselor, she dismissed me so hard and focused on how he was feeling only. I tried to commit suicide in December (I'm okay now though). I was doing okay but the other day I accidentally stumbled across a comment he made on an artist I love (we all had the same music taste).

My mother has a long history of mental issues, and takes meds for it. Sometimes, when I bring up really small things (what college I would like to go to) she freaks the hell out. She screams how I\u2019m a bitch for expecting her to pay for it (I don\u2019t, and with scholarships, grants, loans, and aid I\u2019ll be paying very little out of pocket), tells me I should go back to my emotionally abusive dad to ask for money (then calls me a bitch yet again for obviously not wanting to do this), threatens to kill herself, yelling at me for responding and for staying quiet, for looking at her or avoiding looking her, for crying or not crying, etc. All of this happens around once a month. After, she always apologizes for yelling, but the little things she takes a dig at when she\u2019s pitching a fit goes unnoticed by her (whereas this thought will now be stuck in my head for a very long time). She then keeps reiterating she\u2019s a horrible person/mom, she should kill her self so I can pay for my college with the insurance money, and generally degraded herself. It feels like she\u2019s trying to guilt trip me sometimes, but I k ow it\u2019s just because she has a low self esteem and no tools to help herself feel better and calm down. I\u2019ve found 5 of her suicide notes (1 current, written 1-2 months ago, 4 that were written at least 2 years ago). Long story short- is this emotional abuse? If so, what should I do about it? I feel like I can\u2019t tell anyone she might be suicidal because she would never forgive me if she\u2019s committed. Also, can\u2019t afford a therapist. \n\n2) what can I do to help my mom? I\u2019ve blacklisted a bunch of things from the list of stuff I can talk to her about safely (can\u2019t talk about college, politics, about things she\u2019s done to me, my brother and his shortcomings, my anxiety/depression, and things of that nature). The only close friend I can talk to has way more serious things going on in her life, so I don\u2019t want to unload this on her, and my school counselor is overburdened and will only take on kids that are in serious physical trouble (suicide threat, physical abuse, etc) and even if I could talk to a counselor I would need a permission slip signed by my mom, which I\u2019m pretty sure would set her off. \n\n3) is this considered self harm? Whenever my mom starts getting mad/yelling, I pinch myself on the thigh because it feels good/distracts me/grounds me. I\u2019ve looked it up, and some seem to think it is while other do not. I usually pinch about 200-300 times, and they leave marks for about 5 hours, but I don\u2019t draw blood. The reason why I need to know this is because if it is, I could possible talk with the school counselor since it\u2019s a physical situation (and forge my moms signature on the permission slip). \n\nSummary- is it abuse if they aren\u2019t doing it on purpose? I feel trapped, and like I\u2019ve exhausted all my resources. Is pinching (hard enough to leave marks, not enough to draw blood) self harm? What do I do?

I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for 2 years, he came out of a nice home (happily married parents, not mental illness/abuse, etc)\n\nRecently he\u2019s started voicing concerns that I\u2019d turn into my mother (emotionally abusive) this hurt me deeply, because I\u2019m always careful never to yell or gaslight, and if I\u2019m starting to get riled up I take a minute and calm down. I\u2019ve never hit him, screamed at him, etc, and I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ve never been abusive (he hasn\u2019t told me that I have, just that he\u2019s scared I will be). I will admit I do some annoying things- cry to easily (could come off as manipulative), avoid arguments/discussions, even if they need to be haved, I apologize too much and I\u2019m not nearly as social as him (probably comes off as arrogant or bitchy? I don\u2019t know, hes never brought up why he thinks I\u2019ll be my mom). I obviously don\u2019t want him to be in a relationship where he\u2019s scared of me, but I feel like it\u2019s a little unfair to either A) lump me in with my mom or B) talk to me on how I\u2019m like her, how I can do better.

We don't have enough money for a plumber.  So my BIL has been  helping us.  First we just rigged it to work long enough until we could replace the whole pipe, and the fix leaked every few days. Now though the whole pipe has been replaced, but this is the second time it's leaked.  Totally frustrating.  My feelings of frustration are valid.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what's really freaking got me. Is I'm taking on this extra blame.  I'm asking myself, what did I do to cause this.  I know this is a leftover from my Nex.  He used to blame for everything.  And he'd get all kinds of crazy convoluted.  For instance, the reason we couldn't get ahead, and were always be stuck in a small apartment with car troubles was because I wasn't spiritual enough, or I wasn't working out enough, or I wasn't One with myself enough.  That I was keeping us from aligning with the universe and manifesting a better life.  What the actual FUCK!  What a crap ton of BS.  I can't be the only one with a Nex this psychotic.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been 11 years, you would think I would be over this.  I know. It's really insidious and I spent 10 years with this Mother F-er. From 20-30, and I came from an abusive childhood, ripe for the picking.  I know it's not easy to pick all that crap out and heal.\n\nI'm seriously just venting.  And looking for someone to say, you aren't the only one.  And also maybe being the person who says you aren't the only one.  \n\nI know that I am not the cause of the pipe.  The weather is cold, old galvanized steel pipes break.  We don't  have money for a real plumber because, that's expensive.  My husband isn't blaming me.  My BIL is cool as hell to keep crawling under my house.   But here I am struggling with that feeling that I've done something terrible and the pipe broke because of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's literally insane. I recognize that and I know logically it just isn't so.  But I'm struggling with it tonight.

Behind closed doors. I found these things out, he didn\u2019t outright tell me. \n\nI don\u2019t know, perhaps the universe was desperately trying to give me signs. Because he lived in a different country and I STILL managed to find these things out. We were long distance and somehow, I still got the clues. Because his cooling off led me to investigate. \n\nThere was Facebook. That\u2019s where I found the girl he met in the bar. Then he made everything private. \n\nThen there was that random google search I did. Okay, I\u2019m not proud of it. But lo and behold, I found him on a dating app because he used his full name in a profile. \n\nThen there was the time he sent me a screenshot and whoops, his exes name was hidden at the bottom... you know, the one he \u201cblocked\u201d. No more screenshots after that. \n\nAnd there was instagram. That\u2019s where I found most of his sources. And perhaps I didn\u2019t have the evidence but there was enough. Then he made his profile private. He blamed it on me, for being an \u201cunstable stalker\u201d that made him feel unsafe. \n\nThe list goes on. Now I can\u2019t see a single thing he does. \n\nI guess I feel awful because I wonder what else he was doing that I can\u2019t see. I have no idea who was in his home. What was on his phone. How many dating apps he has. How many women he was messaging. I just have feelings. And worse, I have insecurities that my lack of knowledge is worsening. \n\nBecause sure it was \u201cjust\u201d a like or a follow or a friend request. Except it wasn\u2019t, it was deeper. I knew that. Still I tried to fight it.\n\nI used to then beg and discuss and argue with him, hoping for answers, until he threatened discard every time I so much as wrote a question mark. \n\nBecause I\u2019m starting to realise things are probably a lot, lot worse than I even know. I have no proof however. \n\nIt\u2019s just, many narcs are meant to \u201cthrow in your face\u201d the triangulation etc aren\u2019t they? Mine would have kept it all hidden and kept me nicely out of the country.\n\nHowever, I am a very intuitive person. When I felt him pulling away, ignoring me, disappearing etc, I started investigating. And in hindsight I shouldn\u2019t have. But the fact there was nothing tangible made the insecurities all the more potent, pummelled my self esteem further, and with no answers I continued to cling desperately into his words, his accusations of my insecurity and jealousy, even though I knew, even from the other side of the world, things weren\u2019t right. \n\nI just don\u2019t know how to deal with the fact that he was probably hiding so, so much more. And despite that, I have become an insecure wreck who has flashbacks of every girl I saw him adding whenever he ignored me. \n\nCovert narc? I don\u2019t know. He never threw these things in my face... until there were too many things to ignore.

After enjoying how freaked out I was and toying with me for several hours, my siblings, who also was in on it (and are just as shitty for even helping,) gave it up when they finally realized how scared I was.

The duck me up part where his EXACT WORDS. \n\n-After having enough of it, I attempted to leave only to be forced to stay and getting \"kicked out\" (which didn't really happen. They sent me to my grandmother's house so they still had control over the situation.) after making a rather big deal about being pissed I tried to leave them. This was a month or so ago. \n\n-Have blatantly told me, several times, that I'M the problem and that there's something wrong with me. I'm constantly being told that the way I think, act, that my mindset is a problem, particularly when I disagree with them. \n\n-They have lied to family members about me, saying that I'm mentally unstable and ostracizing me. \n\n-They have taken my phone and laptop. I was homeless for a while and while I was they read the messages my WORRIED FRIENDS sent me, naming them think I was active online and ignoring, despite the fact that I warned them that I war homeless and wouldn't have internet access. \n\n-Constantly, CONSTANTLY compare me to my siblings. \"look at how well your sister is doing,\" \"Your little brother is so smart, he's destined for great things.\" Needless to say, it used to make me feel like absolute garbage. \n\n-Hypocrisy. When my brother was kicked out after a fistfight, my mother cried and argued for him to let my brother back for 6 god damned months straight.

They also made me sleep in the freezing basement, and nearly forced me to pay a fake 300 dollar bill for no other reason than to teach me a lesson. I hate them and I have every god damn right to.

But I'm afraid. But I also want to so that he is known for what he's capable of. In any case, his first name is Brandon and we went to highschool together, him being a year older than me. \n\nWe ran into each other at a bar when I was around 23. We drank and I went home with him. He was home from college so we went to his dad's house where he was staying. He's Muslim and explained to me that his father would be very mad if he heard us coming in or messing around, and so we had to be very quiet. \n\nWe started fooling around on the floor of his living room and I was straddling him. He told me I was extraordinarily beautiful and proceeded to flip me on my back while saying he couldn't help himself. He pulled up my dress and starting taking off my panties. I put my hands down there and told him to stop, and that I didn't want to have sex. \n\nHe did not stop and I kept saying no, but quietly so his dad wouldn't hear us, but definitely loud enough so he could hear me. Before I knew it he was inside of my and I was pushing on his lower torso to try to get him to get out of me. I continued to say stop and that I didn't want to but he wouldn't listen. Then he pulled out and came on my thigh. \n\nI remember pulling my dress down and hurrying out of there. It did not sink in--what had happened. It may never have sunk in until I dreamed about it the other night and remembered. \n\nThe next day I had brunch with some girlfriends also from my highschool and brought up that I had seen Brandon in a bar and went home with him. I then remember saying: \"yeah it was weird. Do you know when you're saying stop and they keep going anyway?\" I remember my friends stopped eating and kind of looked at me like: \"no, we don't.\" But no one used  the word rape. One friend said that \"wasn't cool\" or \"wasn't ok\" or something and everyone just fell awkwardly silent. I don't remember much else. \n\nThank you if you read this whole thing. I know it seems trivial and my other two assaults were much more definitively rape, and less passive, but for some reason I could not assign the word rape to what happened to me, nor could I remember it for a decade. I just feel that's so strange. I feel ashamed and disgusted with myself, remembering all of this so suddenly, ten yrs later. I keep thinking about it. I want to say his full name.

I cried over fear of abandonment, he reassured me we are in it \"til the end\" and I now have mixed feelings about it.

Read if you like. Maybe you'll relate to my fairytale........\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat a year 2018 was. It was truly the most devastating, soul crushing experience of my life. I felt like I was in a delusional fairytale and I was the princess and suddenly, I learned that my prince charming was actually an illusion and he was really the evil witch all along, masquerading as the prince.\n\nI learned that people can be really evil. Like the kind of evil you only read about in books or see in movies. That personality disorders aren't just awful for the person suffering from them, but incredibly dangerous to those who surround and love them.\n\nI realized I was engulfed in an obsession, a tragic toxic relationship that uprooted me from my values into this complicated, senseless mess who could no longer see happiness in anything she looked at. I almost gave up on myself. I reached a point I never thought was possible and I almost let the evil witch destroy me. I had barely anything left in me. When the witch tried to destroy me, I almost put my hands up and said fine, take me, destroy my world, what is a world without a Prince anyway?\n\nBut then, my fairy godmother came. My fairy godmother came in many forms. Trusted friends since I was young, new friends who've battled their own witches, and even, my parents. My fairy godmothers reminded me who I was, that I was STRONGER than this, BETTER than this, and that I NEEDED to hear some tough love and fight harder for myself. And FINALLY, my fairy godmothers and their magical uplifting powers got through to me.\n\nENOUGH OF YOU WITCH! I broke the spell!! I no longer was compelled by my obsession! My need to know what the witch was up to. My need to react to the witches evil deeds evaporated as I learned the greatest power of ALL in order to defeat the witch. The way to BEAT the evil witch was to no longer SEE THE witch, put an invisibility cloak over them and RENDER them useless! So here I am, 6 months later. Sleeping like a baby. I checked off almost half the goals I had on my 2017 list which makes me proud. I am not chronically stressed and while I may be currently be without a prince, I've learned I certainly don't need a prince to be happy and content.  And with this new strength, I'll certainly be able to see much clearer next time an evil witch tries to come into my life masquerading as a prince.\n\nSo all I can say about this is..

Anyway, When I was in college several years ago I entered into a relationship with a narcissist and I had no idea really what a narcissist was or what to look for. It went on for a long time and destroyed my self esteem and perception of myself. It was one of the most painful things I ever went through and it took a lot of work and therapy so set my life straight and I\u2019m proud of how far I\u2019ve come. I\u2019ve had a best friend since childhood and he was such a gentle and kind person. He started dating a man who I immediately got that sinking feeling in my gut about when I met. He was superficially charming and boastful about his life. He said comments like \u201cI don\u2019t care much for my kids. I mean I love them don\u2019t get me wrong but they\u2019re a huge inconvenience\u201d when I heard that the alarm bells were going full off. Things began to really spiral down once I ran a background check on him and found divorces, DUIs, and assaults that my friend knew nothing about. I actually printed off the background check because my friend just couldn\u2019t believe it and said I must be mistaken, he\u2019s completely snowed and love bombed at this point. The narc became extremely angry at me when my friend presented this information and he took my friends phone to text me. He continued to text me hateful things often posing as my friend. We became unable to communicate through the phone with each other. So when I saw my friend he admitted how bad things had gotten. He was screamed at and threatened to be thrown out of their apartment because he forgot to wash this guys jeans. Then the guy love bombed him so all was well. He made my friend lose his job because he would show up to his office and bring his kids and make a scene. So now my friend has no job and lost his home to move in with him and he\u2019s basically stuck. My husband and I begged my friend to move in with us and leave before things get worse. He was considering it but his narc was so angry that he saw us without permission that he blew up my phone once again posing as my friend and saying how worthless I am and that I don\u2019t deserve friends and so I had to block my friends number. A few days later we got a huge box in the mail that had tons of gifts and trinkets I\u2019d given to my friend over the years. I feel this huge guilt and cloud over me that I couldn\u2019t do more or I couldn\u2019t save him. I haven\u2019t talked to him in months and I feel like at this point our friendship is shattered. I wish I had done some things differently but I feel so helpless knowing someone I love is with a narc. I guess I just don\u2019t know where to go from here and if I just need to put it out of my mind. It was destroying me when we were able to talk and hang out. I also feel such guilt realizing the relationships I ruined and the way I treated people when I was under the thumb of my narc.

He also sexually assaulted me right at the beginning of the relationship, and made degrading comments about my body which destroyed my already-low self-esteem. I know I should have made a clean break when I ended it, and I finally did this a year ago. \n\nA year ago: he'd been messaging me about how I didn't give him enough attention, and I had a lot of stuff going on in my personal life and wasn't replying. He eventually blew up, told me he'd punched through a window and was bleeding everywhere, and then said he never wanted to speak to me again. I was thrilled because all of my previous attempts to cut contact failed because he'd either guilt trip me by threatening self-harm or make me feel as though I wasn't intelligent or nice enough to manage without him. He deleted me on Facebook so I immediately blocked him, and blocked his number.\n\nHe's sent me a couple of emails over the last year, and has been talking to mutual acquaintances about me. I got another email tonight which is full of references to his suicidal thinking, about how he hopes we can give it another shot, about how he's changed, and why am I being like this.

I started learning more and more about emotional abuse and I couldn't believe I had a textbook case example of someone who was a narcissist. But I was MADLY in love.  I still am as I'm literally running away from him right now.  I've started therapy recently and I'm seeing it all more and more clearly every day.  It's beyond unhealthy.  The 3 things over the last 24 hours that led to where I am right now:\n\n1. We were watching tv and he leaned over and started pinching under my chin and poking laughing and goes what's that? Yea, it's chin fat, I'm getting older, I have a small gobbler, get over it. He's super overweight... I weight 130lbs.  Sure, make me feel like I'm not good enough for you asshole.\n2. He asked me to get dinner delivered and I asked him what he was in the mood for.  He said bbq, ok, I ordered bbq just for him even though I told him I really really wanted ramen.  He proceeded to get hammered drunk (not uncommon) and when the food came he said he wasn't hungry and to just put it in the fridge.  I screamed at him I spent $60 on delivery bbq and I didn't even want it and now he's not going to eat? I called him a selfish asshole (I should have just let it go but I'm so over letting things like that go) and he lost his mind.  Of course. Called me every name in the book, threw a beer at me, but I didn't cry, I didn't move, I didn't even look at him.  I slept on the couch, I didn't want to be near him last night. He didn't come kiss me on the forehead or put a blanket on me or say he was sorry like a normal human. Complete radio silence in the next room for over 14 hours.\n3. Late morning he was still in bed and I wanted to get up and get some coffee.  His building has a cute coffee shop in it but I need his keys to get between floors so I opened up his kitchen drawer to get his keys, which he heard and bolted out of the bedroom.  He started yelling what the fuck, why are you stealing my keys?! I told him calmly I was going downstairs to get coffee and he lost it again telling me I'm stealing his things and I'm not allowed to touch his property.\n\nSo.. at that point, I finally broke.  I finally just said, ok, I'm done. I took a breath, I said ok, that's enough, I'm all done. I went quietly and calmly through each room gathering everything I'd ever left there over the years, shoes, toiletries, electronics, I got it all.  While I was doing this, he was sitting on the couch watching a movie laughing at it and didn't say a word to me. I jammed as much as I could into my luggage and the rest in a garbage bag.  I booked a hotel near the airport online, got an Uber, and I'm on my way to the hotel where I'll stay until my flight Monday morning.  As I walked out the door I looked at him and said, ok, bye fighting every tear I could.  He just looked at me rolled his eyes and laughed.\n\nI am ... I don't know.  He's already texted asking where he should send two things (I must have missed them and like he doesn't have my address right).  I will not text him back.  I will not text him back.  I cannot text him back.\n\nI feel free but scared and I miss him already.  It's sick.  This is a sick disease.  I know this is about to be the hardest few months of my life, but I have to do this.  I have be normal again.\n\nJust wanted to get it out there and pray for peace, help, strength, encouraging words, and love from this community.  You have all shown me how much better life can be.

I didn't tell my mom what happened until I was 16 and that's when I found out about my sister. The worst part is nothing ever happened to him. My sister and I still have to sometimes see him at family events and we have to all just pretended like nothing happened. Which I think has really messed me up over the years. And ever since having my daughter I just can't deal with it anymore. The thought of someone doing that to her or any child is just debilitating. He also is married now and has an 8 year old son. I worry that he might be abusing him as well but I have no proof of that nor have I seen anything that would lead me to that. My cousin was abused by his uncle when he was little, who was also abused and so on. I worry that this will just keep going down the family line as it just seems to be swept under the rug. I've also been having intimacy issues with my husband for years and we are currently trying to work on it and will be going to a psychologist. I guess I'm just feeling frustrated and helpless. The abuse happened so long ago but still has this control over me. I've struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life. And he just gets to live his life with no consequences. But I can't even report it if I'm not 100% sure it was him and it was so long ago. I think having my daughter made me have to relive what happened to me and how badly I want to protect her from abuse. The sad part is there isn't a woman I know who wasn't abused at some point in her life.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I walked away and started crying because I get worried when he does it. He also becomes an even bigger asshole on it. He was saying that I\u2019m overreacting and that I ruined our last vacation day, that I ruined his night for getting upset and crying. He started mocking my cries.

Says it was just a bump cause the guy approached him and he wasn\u2019t going out looking for it. REPEATEDLY was saying how I ruined everything, the night, the vacation, his mood.

I\u2019ve been in therapy the last 4 years because she threatened to leave me if I didn\u2019t go.  When I first started going (I\u2019m treated at a very well regarded mental heath teaching hospital) they diagnosed me with BPD. I was devastated. Then a couple years went by and one day I played recordings of her screaming  at me. I brought it in with the sincere attempt to ask my therapist if he thought I was handling these conversations well or if my BPD issues were causing her anger. He listened to it and was quiet for a long time. After that, all of the therapy changed. It wasn\u2019t until months later that the therapists slowly started to hint that something wasn\u2019t right with her - that he knew she was volatile from my recounting stories - but that they didn\u2019t have any evidence except what I was telling them, and that the recordings made them\nUnderstand just how bad the abuse was. They started to tell me they were not sure their diagnosis was correct anymore - that it was more likely I had complex PTSD which presents like BPD. They very slowly, and ethically, told me that I was being abused in diabolical ways and was like a frog boiling in water.  They did it in a very deliberate, slowly revealing way so as to very carefully undo all of her brainwashing. The next time she threatened to divorce me I went to see a lawyer. The process has gone on for a year. So much hovering, so much second guessing myself from the trauma bonding... then I read her diary.\n\nWe never had a sex life really with the exception of the first few years together. It was unbearable for me. I had to beg for sex and we maybe had it 4 times/year. It was always my fault as to why we didn\u2019t. I even started to wonder if she was asexual.  But there it all was - written down. The affairs that went on for years. For most of our marriage.\n\nI wasn\u2019t angry when I first read it. I was almost relieved. By the time I read it I knew she was a severe Narc. My therapists finally told me - with all their caveats tho - and that they needed to wait and slowly treat the trauma bond before they revealed more. But I felt nothing for weeks. I just felt like it was further proof that she was indeed a person with NPD. I needed the proof to let go and be told over and over that she\u2019d never get better and that she\u2019s not the person I thought she was. That this person doesn\u2019t exist and never has.\n\nBut today it hit me - the rage. I\u2019m so angry I don\u2019t know what to do with it. We are divorcing for sure - I even have a close date on a new home. But I don\u2019t know why - for whatever reason I woke up today and felt every bit of all of the wrong that has been done to me all at once. All the things I should never have tolerated - but did. All of the magical thinking that she wasn\u2019t cheating on me but instead it turns out she\u2019s a disgusting with no conscious. It all caught up with me today and I don\u2019t know what to do with it. \n\nIs this what happens? Is this part of the recovery cycle? ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It's been happening for well over 5 years and sometimes he even hits my mother. I have confronted my mother but she always says 'its normal' and 'he will stop eventually' I'm thirteen about to be fourteen and my dad lives on the other side of the world (I live in Australia he lives in England) I also have a lot of problems with controlling my anger, in the sense of that I don't always immediately do something and let it build up until I do something that could get someone hurt. My real father and I are in really good contact and call often for up to 2 hours. I have always been taught since I was little never to hurt a woman no matter the case, unless they are literally holding a gun to your head, and even then I have been told to act with care.

I am really scared one day I will go through with it. I have tried to self harm on a few accasions. I think it would be better if I went to live with my dad, but my mum won't allow it, she always says she doesn't mind if I leave but when ever I try to leave she makes up a heap of bullshit and normally starts using drugs to deal with the stress (her and my step dad are big time drug users, and my step dad is a small time drug dealer) what should I do?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

(long story)", "author": "Elsaage", "self_text": "Hi guys! \n\nIve been silently reading through some posts on this sub and am finally ready to share my story. English is not my native language so please excuse my writing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIve been with my boyfriend for almost 5 years now. I dont even know where to begin, I try to keep it short and focus on the recent events. Though it might get long, Im sorry!\n\nOn Christmas we were supposed to go visit his family. And he got into raging mode because his hair wasnt doing as he pleased so he threw some bottles through the bathroom and went showering again in the end. As I am already used to his rage the only thing I did was sit on the couch in the living room waiting for him to finally be ready. When he is in that state of mind I can just sit still and wait till its over. If I try to talk to him or calm him down it gets worse/doesnt change a thing. He never laid a hand on me and I guess that is something that makes all this so diffusing and unclear to me. Anyway he was finally ready, still in a mad mood, we went outside, he asked if I would drive/If we drive with my car - I said yes and got into my car. He sat in the passenger seat for like 3 seconds, then got out and proceeded to get into his own car. I thought \"ok if he wants to drive\" and wanted to get into his car. Before I could get there he started to drive out the parking lot, stopped, looked at me as I waved my warms like what the fuck is he doing, and drove back like a fucking maniac, he almost hit me. I dont know why I even got into his car, that was the biggest mistake. I said, I thought we were gonna drive together since anything else wouldnt make sense. He said, he got into his car because my answer to his question earlier, as to if I would drive, was \"I dont know\". And I clearly remembered that I did not say this. I tried to tell him and he got even angrier. So I shut up and prayed for this ride to be over soon.\n\nSeriously, this was the lowest point of them all. He drove like a maniac. I have never been so afraid of him, not only his driving. The tires were squealing and I often thought we were goign to fall off the street. When we arrived I couldnt even look at him. I was so upset and at the same time kind of strangely calm. Trying not to let my emotions out and cry. My mood was totally destroyed. We greeted his family and sat down to the table. His mother had dinner ready because we were an hour late. And not even half an hour later he acted like nothing ever happened. Like he didnt almost kill us both. And I just couldnt let it go. And later he tried to hug and kiss me and i refused. I was still so devastated inside. Of course he couldnt understand and got angry at me for not acting like nothing happened. We went upstairs to talk and his excuse was that all that anger and frustration and rage wasnt against me but because of himself. And he couldnt understand how I could be that affected by it and act so distant even after 3 hours passed. \n\nThen this situation turned into a breakup talk. With his whole fucking family downstairs, waiting for us to come back. And yes I was so close to ending it. He didnt understand anything and talked about what else was not working in our relationship right now. I couldnt believe we had this kind of talk right there. I cant remember all of the talk right now but we decided to talk it all through when we got home so we bought some time. \n\nWe talked in bed, I cant remember everything, this evening is all blurry now. But we decided to try again. Of course there were a thousand things I had to change to make it work and he only had to work on his anger issue, which he of course improved a lot the last few months. \n\nAnyway he acted so kind in the following weeks, always friendly and loving. But it was like a switch has been turned that evening. I couldnt bring myself to believe him this time. I was very distant, little kisses and hugs and only one time having sex. I just couldnt forget the way I felt on that drive. Kind of just waiting for the next incident to happen.\n\nAnd I was reading a lot of stuff on this sub. Which didnt help to get closer to him again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo recently we had a big talk. I could finally tell him everything that was bothering me all along. It started when he was telling how bad it was at work because he wouldnt connect with his coworkers and he even said that he has no empathy and only tries to do what is expected from him or what he could copy. I kind of knew it all along but hearing him say it, was eye opening. He apologized for a lot. Insults, downgrading, cutting my words, nitpicking. And said he would stop. It is rather \"harmless\" he never called me names. Just small things like \"Are you really too dumb to ...\" and such. But summed up they were just too much. And of course it was my fault. He promised it wouldnt happen again. And I am trying, still trying to believe him. And at the same time kind of waiting for it to happen again. \n\nI know Im no way perfect. Im clumsy and forgetful and am a creative and chaotic person. But Im working on myself and it got better. Sometimes though I dont even have the strength to clean and it bothers him a lot. I understand and try my best. He gets mean and angry and even says he does it because it is the only way that I get up and clean. \n\nI have my own bad habits and they are hard to break. But he is no way perfect. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that talk I felt the need to talk to him again and make it clear that when he belittles me again, that we would be through. He then said this was unfair because he is working on it but he isnt perfect and it might happen again even though he doesnt want it to. And I was lured in again. Because I do understand, I cant change my own flaws in a short time either. \n\nReconsiling now I am just not sure about anything anymore. We are living together for 4 years and recently moved into a house with our best friends who are also a couple. There is a lot at stake for me and I dont even know if it matters anymore if he is a narc. There have been many occasions leading to us fighting over him not understanding why he hurt me and me crying and of course the little times we had sex. He cant understand that if he hurts me or belittles me that I dont want to get intimate with him. Or if Im stressed. Which is sometimes caused by him but mostly because Im still in an apprenticeship (dont know if that is the right word) and workin at the same time.\n\nIts just so hard for me to see through all of it and I finally decided to go to consulting. I havent made an appointment yet though. I dont know what Im expecting from you all. Just your opinion on the situation maybe. \n\nSometimes I feel like he is a big kid unable to deal with his emotions. \n\nThere are so many more situations that I thought were off. But this one already is way too long. Im sorry and thank you for reading!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When I was 14, I learned they (aunts/uncles, furthermore \u201cthe abused\u201d) were sexually abused by their father - my grandpa.\n\nYears went by and I knew it wasn't the whole story. Three of the abused committed themselves for suicide watch. Most of the abused have mysteriously disappeared, moved, or cut off contact with the family - only to come back crazier than ever. Some of the abused have changed their names. Many of the abused have anxiety so severe they won't drive a car. Many are heavily medicated and say some of the weirdest shit you've ever heard.\n\nMeanwhile I (age 19 - 21) moved into a total drug dungeon with a partner. We sold and did huge amounts of drugs. There were many times I thought I would die. And I didn\u2019t care.\n\nThis person took my virginity by force and continued to rape me throughout our relationship. Eventually we tried to get clean and I succeeded -\u00a0they failed. They expected me to continue trafficking drugs. They expected me to limit their intake so \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t lose control and take too much\u201d -\u00a0*while I was detoxing from heroin*.\n\nOne night this partner and I found our very old male neighbor hemorrhaging to death from a blow to the head. An injury that left me kneeling in blood telling him it was going to be ok while he gasped to live. I could taste the blood in the air, it was so thick. His brain matter was splattered all over the floor. I called 911 - obviously - but the damage was too severe and he died.\n\nMy partner told me after, \u201cI am so shut off to emotion I can watch people die and feel nothing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when I finally got my shit together and realized my partner was a fucking psychopath and I got up and left at 3 AM and didn\u2019t go back.\n\nI somehow intrinsically knew I wasn't supposed to tell my family about this relationship. But about two years ago I'd had enough and I came out to them about my addiction and my abusive relationship. They were VERY accepting despite their hugely religious background.\n\nI started noticing weird things again, now that I wasn\u2019t drowned in opiates. Why did I stay in a relationship like that? Why was I so easily seduced by psychopaths (that person wasn't the only one)? Why had I thought about suicide every day since I was 10 years old? Why was one of my parents so addicted to prescription medication that they were absolutely incoherent and I had to raise my siblings? Why did this parent disappear for months on end with no explanation? Why did this parent submit to electroshock therapy and why was\u00a0*I*\u00a0the fucking \u201cguardian\u201d (at 18 years old) that had to drive them their and watch this horror take place in front of my eyes? Why was this parent OBSESSED with murder shows and movies, but REFUSED to talk about anything demonic (like satan or possession).\n\nI'm now pushing 30. A few months ago, I listened to a podcast on dissociative identity disorder. The female on the podcast talked about how her parents sold her to the sex trade and did horrible, horrible things. Sex traffickers killed people in front of her so she wouldn't talk. She ended up developing multiple personalities, rightfully so. I lay on the floor paralyzed in tears. I started remembering shit my parent used to say to me. It was like this podcast was a key that opened a box deep in my brain. Like how I wasn't allowed to talk to certain members of the family. I was FORBIDDEN to go past a certain point in my grandmother\u2019s yard. My parent was terrified I would drown but refused to get me swimming lessons. My parent said whack shit about clowns and satan. One of the abused told me and my cousin, \u201cthank god you were born so you can fix this mess.\u201d But didn\u2019t elaborate.\n\nI\u2019d had enough. A few months ago I confronted some of the abused and this is what they told me. \u201cWe wanted to tell you but we didn\u2019t know how. Yes, your grandfather sexually abused us but it was much more than that. He sold us to the sex trade. He violently killed animals in front of us and held us kids under water until we nearly drowned. He and his friends took us in the woods behind your grandmother\u2019s house and did horrible, horrible things - dressed as clowns. He told us Satan would get us if we didn\u2019t obey. We were just kids. \u201d So on and so forth. They told me all of the abused believed it except two. One of them moved far away and doesn\u2019t talk to the family. The other one was my parent - who's legitimately insane.\n\nThese patterns have continued. While my grandfather is now dead (burn in hell you sick fuck), many of the abused have brought people into the family who have raped their children (my cousins).\n\nThe abused do have a moral compass, they avoided the psychopathy gene. But while they know this is wrong, they can\u2019t stop the pattern from occurring. I\u2019ve spent months confronting each member individually and I\u2019m doing perhaps the most serious confrontation today. I don\u2019t know what happened to me - if anything - but i know i'm severely fucked up. I'm weird about people, trust, and I resent being touched. I have severe depression, anxiety, and sexual distress. I'm overly paranoid and I only relate to people with severe trauma. I've had debilitating panic attacks since I was 5 or 6. At the same time, many of my closest friends know nothing about my past. I'm a master of masking emotion.\n\nI have done many child abuse exercises and every time I end up in a sobbing panic attack that debilitates me for days.\n\nToday my cousin and I will confront a family member that has the most ability to start healing for my parent. I\u2019ve been shaking with anxiety since last night and I want to fucking leave the country. I am absolutely furious this duty has fallen on me and my cousin. We are the children in this situation. And while I know much of the abuse occurred to the abusers while THEY were children, they did nothing in their adulthood to heal, change, stop the behavior, or even FUCKING TELL ME ABOUT IT. Rather they all just had a bunch of kids and perpetuated the cycle. Somehow I've known all of this was true for almost 30 years. And even telling them \"I'm traumatized, I feel crazy, I stayed in a relationship with a psychopath for years,\" they didn't say, \"oh, maybe this history played into it.\" Or maybe when I took my parent to ECT they could have said \"wow that must be traumatizing for you. Your parent is getting this therapy because \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\"\n\nThey've had a thousand chances to start a conversation. Instead they waited until I was far into adulthood to ever mention anything - and only after I brought it up.\n\nWe - as the children - had to come to\u00a0*them*\u00a0for the truth. And no, it\u2019s not \u201cmy job\u201d to fix all this shit, but somebody\u2019s got to do something and if I don\u2019t try I\u2019ll die with the guilt.\n\nI\u2019m fucking furious. I\u2019m furious at my grandfather for the abuse, first and foremost. I\u2019m furious at the abused for perpetuating the cycle. I\u2019m furious at myself for falling victim of abuse myself. I\u2019m furious that the abused says \u201cthank god you were born so you can fix this mess.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m fucking pissed.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TLDR: My family has generations of sexual and physical abuse. While they\u2019ve had the gusto to get away from those people, they don't talk about it or make changes. It affected me as a child and affects me to this day. My cousin and I are the only ones who have the balls to confront this psychological horror and I am furious.**", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Now all of you have different scenarios so it may/may not work for all of you, but this is from my own experience.\n\nMy mom drinks heavily each day (there's never a day she's sober) and rages loudly every other day. She had hit &amp; slapped me (while I was an adult), scratched my arms, spat on my father and I before on our heads, called my brother , father and I \"queers\" , threatened me, would lock doors on me in the cold morning after taking my dad to work because I didn't have a car, would destroy my father's property and completely burn his furniture and ripped it up into tiny pieces and even would yell at me through my bedroom door so that I couldn't sleep for 20+ hours in the past, she would burn random things outside at 4 am, and just overall very unstable to live with. \n\n\nNow most of that treatment has stopped happening to me but I realize I can't stay at that house any longer than I financially can. \n\nWhile the emotional  abuse was really bad that's not the worst part. The worst part is the normalising behavior that my father has for her. He complains about her and argues with her drunken abusive behavior almost daily but then just a few hours later they're watching tv together and acting like nothing ever happened. They'd have big dinners just hours after her behavior, and she would make food each time. \n\nThen when I could no longer take this strange behavior it made me so puzzled and angry. Now I've gotten so angry I've finally done something about it! I'm applying to a second job to utilize my time more efficiently and make a lot more money than I'm currently. \n\nMy thoughts were this: why can't I have a normal consistent peaceful happy day ? Why am I still living with this? I can only help myself since govt services won't help then I need another job! I need to stop having a victim mentality (after I get out of the house due to their treatment), I need to take care better care of myself and not waste my time with parents who don't care about me and my important life decisions/milestones, I need to find friends, I need to earn enough for an apartment, I need to look for these abusive/toxic red flags in a possible future girlfriend/lover.\n\nIt's still a bad living situation since you're basically treated as if you're \"using\" them even when I buy my own food with the little money I own. \n\n\nOnly few YouTube videos helped me out with abuse and how to handle it. The ones that stuck with me were the ones that said you have to get angry enough to finally say enough is enough &amp; I don't need these people in my life anymore &amp; I need to change this situation on my own no matter how hard it is going to be. \n\nIt's an attitude that never quits. You deserve better people in life. \ud83d\ude20\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "abuse"}

So, so sorry it's this long, I haven't written this all out before. \n\nI'm 31 and female, I was around 14 possibly just 15, so this was around 2002-ish, I'm not exactly sure. \nOne of my mum's friends knew a woman (Michelle) who was looking for a babysitter for her kids who were around 6 and 4, every now and again on a Friday night. My mum's friend mentioned this to me as I'd met Michelle at a christening briefly and she had asked her specifically to find out if I'd do it. She told me Michelle and her boyfriend (not her kids dad) would pay me \u00a340, pick me up from home and drop me back in the morning. They needed a sitter so they could go out for drinks as they never got any time alone as the kids real dad wasn't on the scene for whatever reason. Obviously I said yes because of the money, \u00a340 was a lot to a teen and I had nothing else to do so I was happy to do it. \n\nSo the first time to go round comes, and the couple (both early 30s) come to get me and take me to theirs, Michelle and my mum had a quick chat and it all seemed fine so off we went. On the way there they asked me if I smoked (which was a bit odd thinking back but I just thought this couple were super cool), I lied and said no then Michelle pulls a 20 pack out of her bag laughing and says \"well you won't want these then will you?\", obviously I took them but asked them not to tell my mum's friend and they assured me they wouldn't.\n\nWe get to the house and as soon as you walked in the living room, the smell of weed hit you and there was a huge, and I mean massive, poster of a characature of the Queen smoking a joint pinned over the fireplace. I thought to myself that was pretty fucking weird when they have kids living there, but again I just thought they were the coolest adults ever. The kids seem really nice and about 10 minutes after we arrived at theirs, they headed off out to the pub. They tell me i can use their phone to ring whoever I want when the kids fall asleep, but to make sure its a landline. This was when mobile phones were just becoming a big thing and I was never allowed to use the phone at home so I was thrilled. \n\nImmediately after they leave the 6 year old girl drags me to the kitchen to the bread bin and opens it showing me tons of small brownies wrapped in cling film, maybe about 20 of them. She tells me these are her mums boyfriends 'naughty cakes' and if we eat any of them we will get a smack, I thought this was a seriously fucked up conversation to be having with a 6 year old so I told her to close the bin and come watch tv. The kids fall asleep earlyish and I spend the next few hours on the phone to whoever would answer. Michelle and her boyfriend return early hours and pass me watching TV on the sofa (where I slept), after a brief couple of minute chat they went to bed. They took me home after breakfast the next day.\n\nThey ask me to sit again maybe a month later and obviously I say il do it due to the money, cigarettes and free phone. Everything is fine the next few times I go round and follows the pattern above pretty closely. The fourth time I go over the same again, they go out then come home later and straight to bed. I'm asleep on the couch (on my front, fully clothed) a couple of hours after they got home when I wake up feeling a massive pressure on my back and vague rubbing on my face. I remember so clearly thinking what the actual fuck is happening and trying to work it out whilst coming round. The TV is on, about 10ft away, but the room is pitch black otherwise so I can hardly see. I reached behind my head to whatever was touching my face and felt the stubble of Michelle's boyfriends beard and tried to get up from under him. I'm more or less full panic attack at this point and my dressing gown I was wearing is stuck underneath this man now. When I pull it free I turn around to look at him and he is fully naked with an erection and he is showing it to me but his eyes are closed the whole time.\n\nI ran upstairs to the kids room and got in the daughters bed with her, I remember I reasoned that it was the safest option. A moment later I hear Michelle come from her own bedroom and run downstairs where naked pervo still was. Muffled screaming ensures for a few minutes and I hear them coming back up the stairs to their room and Michelle is repeating over and over to boyfriend: \"you have ruined it now.\" I lie there trying to be silent and luckily they don't come into the kids room. At this point it is about 4am and I lie there terrified until 6am when I sneak out of the house and call a taxi from the local supermarkets phone and using my earnings to pay for it.\n\nObviously I never hear from them again and I tell a few of my friends about what happened, but never tell my parents as my dad was the kind of man who would have beat the shit out of the guy rather than call the police. I thought my dad would get in trouble and also I was just so confused about what happened. I reasoned for the next 10 years that  Michelles bf was sleepwalking after loads of alcohol and didn't actually intend to scare me.\n\nThe past 6 years or so I have started to think about this event on a very regular basis. I'm breathing quite heavily just from writing it down. I have kids of my own now and I have been feeling really really guilty lately for not telling an adult about what happened at the house, it is eating me alive that I may have been able to stop the kids being abused in one way or another by those people if I'd spoken up. I don't remember the boyfriends name at all, Michelles surname or exactly which house it was they lived at if I were to do something at this late stage. Was I sexually abused or was this just a messed up accident? The fact they were giving me loads of things like cigs etc makes me wonder if they were grooming me? What did Michelle mean by ruined it?\n\nThank you so much for reading.\n\nTL;DR - I babysat for a couple when I was a teen and the male of the pair lay on top of me naked with an erection but he didn't seem to be awake, was this a sexual assault?

I'm really interested in hearing what other people have experienced, on what kind of time frames, and if they think there was any symbolic aspect to it.  \n\nI'll go through mine chronologically. I very quickly noticed I lost my appetite and was having a lot of trouble sleeping. I put this down to the excitement of starting a new relationship, but there was something dark about it that hasn't been there in other relationships. In his presence I felt dizzy and foggy-headed. After certain things he said and did, I would get cutting feelings in my chest, or completely dissociate. Within a couple of weeks I lost the ability to get to a peaceful state in meditation. In fact I was finding it impossible to meditate full stop. Over the course of the few months we were together I developed a burning, searing pain through my chest and up into my throat, my solar plexus felt like it was being cinched and I would also sometimes get sharp stabbing pains around my stomach, sides and lower back. My anxiety also got worse and worse after spending any time with him, sometimes feeling on the verge of a panic attack for days.   \n\nSo why did I stay through that? It sounds awful, right? As I mentioned, to begin with I thought it might be normal nerves from a new relationship. As time went on though I felt like I was the problem, like my body might just be *making stuff up*. This went hand in hand with him blaming me for being too sensitive towards his behaviour. In hindsight I can simply describe him as being domineering, callous, cruel, condescending and aloof, but he denied all of it and so to solve the problem of why I was feeling so bad, figured it must be me.   \n\nNow, over 2 months since I've even seen him, I still have intense shifting pains. I had a constant burning in my heart for weeks but now I get a more cutting pain there. This switches with the stabbing feelings around my torso and also just a general feeling of my ribs being constricted.  \n\nI've thought a bit about the possible symbolism. With heart pain, it seems like a clear link to feeling my love was being abused. The solar plexus is apparently linked to a chakra involving feelings of power, so it also makes sense that I had pain there when he was in control of me. My dizzy, foggy-headedness I think was an indication that he was managing to brainwash me into not seeing clearly what was really happening, and I think the stabbing might be related to recognising that he was literally attacking me, although he tried to deny and conceal it.   \n\nI'm really curious to hear if other people experienced anything like this, and if they felt they could find meaning in any of it. Thanks for reading.  \n\nEdit: I forgot to mention, we were only together for a few months but I became ill several times in that period, so I think the stress may also have been compromising my immune system.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Complicating the situation is the fact that she is from another country and English is her second language, so in the past I chalked up her strange and anti-social behavior to cultural differences or the language barrier or dysfunctional family background. Anyway, she has a habit of relying on the fact that she is foreign or doesn't speak the language as an excuse for a lot of things. Often she will interrupt me in the middle of something to make me check her English, even in personal texts to friends. She works in a similar field at a different company, and she will often email me at work to ask me to correct her own work for her own job. When she was going to community college, she would make me \"check\" her work -- which basically means I would have to end up redoing the work for her. (And I say \"make.\" When she first tried this, I suggested she do her own work so she could actually learn something, and she blew up...so it wasn't worth going through hell every time.) In a nutshell, instead of spending the last decade learning and building up communication and job skills, she has insisted on relying on me to do everything, including all the basic day-to-day things like paying bills, turning on the TV, and using the computer. Before I just thought it was insecurity and/or laziness, but now I'm beginning to think it's a strategy to try to keep me with her...Preying on me being a \"good guy\" and not throwing her out on her rear, where she would likely end up on the streets without me.

Long story cut short he is now essentially homeless and is crashing on a friends sofa. Has been since the beginning of January. He has quite a temper that runs high. But because of the situation he is in he has become so much more prone to outbursts. When something goes wrong he blows up, he will insult me constantly, say that I am a waste of time and that I constantly piss him off. He says I\u2019m half assed about everything I do even though I have done everything I can possibly do to help him including lending him a lot of money which I know for a fact I\u2019ll never see again. He will threaten to go off and sleep with other people if I can\u2019t just make things happen. I\u2019ve been trying so hard to help him get a place to live but I\u2019m only 18 and I have no idea what I\u2019m doing, I am limited in what I can do. He keeps telling me to leave home so that my parents will help us get a place to live because they wouldn\u2019t want me to be out on the streets. He gets mad at me any time I try to tell him that what he has said has hurt me. I end up apologising to him. I went out drinking with some friends the other night and ended up getting very drunk, I was upset because I missed him and so my friend tried calling him on my phone but it was very late so he was asleep and didn\u2019t answer. I woke up the next day to see a ton of messages from him. He was really angry about the calls and for some reason assumed I had got drunk and slept with someone else and said in one message that if I didn\u2019t reply to him within 20 minutes that he would actively go out of his way to fuck someone else. He calls me useless, too skinny, a cunt, full of shit and whatever else you could possibly imagine. I fell in love with him before I knew what he was really like. And now I know I don\u2019t want to be in this relationship. It\u2019s toxic and I\u2019m so depressed all the time. I get close to having a panic attack every time I have a message from him because I\u2019m just so scared about what he is going to say next. But I can\u2019t leave him. He has been saying that if I can\u2019t get him a place to live that he is going to kill himself. I don\u2019t know what to do.  I don\u2019t know how much longer I can cope, he has taken over my life and I can\u2019t see a way out. ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

She is 29 years old, has been abusive for my entire life, and in her chaos has essentially destroyed my family. She has an INCREDIBLY good job (started her own recruiting firm in a big city I will not name) and makes a lot of money that she spends on excessive shopping, multiple luxury gym memberships, regular SoulCycle and yoga classes, etc. She still lives with my parents for some reason, claiming it to be financial. I do not really know why. She commutes to the city for work.\n\nMy father has always refused to kick her out because \u201chis kids ALWAYS have a place with him\u201d so even when I was in high school and my therapists would insist that he needed to remove her from our home in order for me to be a healthy, functional student and person... he refused. I graduated college and have mostly been living at home since, working a job in my field and putting a lot of my income into savings so that I can move to the city. When I am not working, I travel out of state to visit my long-distance partner so I am not always here. \n\nShe has always been emotionally and verbally abusive, with a general violent tinge (throwing things, destroying belongings, hitting, etc) to both me and my mother. In recent months I have been successful in \u201ccutting her off\u201d essentially, even avoiding speaking to her on her birthday, and I\u2019m proud because I usually get threatened into communicating with her again. \n\nAbout a month ago, she was going on an abusive rampage... and I took a video of it. She saw me filming it and jumped me. I have footage of that happening and photos of the marks left on my arms from her attack. That\u2019s what triggered me cutting her off. So... tonight, she was losing her mind again. She was being cruel to my mother and I said, \u201chey, don\u2019t speak to her like that\u201d and long story short, she lost it. Started off with her telling me to shut up and leave her alone, but eventually escalated into shrieking and screaming about how *I\u2019m* the terrible daughter, how I\u2019m a loser, how I just wanted to pick a fight, how I\u2019m a waste of space, that my job is fake (?), racist comments about my boyfriend, that I\u2019m a \u201cworthless piece of shit.\u201d I sleep on the couch because she was given my bed. She decided she was going to sleep there instead and I told her no, not because I wouldn\u2019t like my bed back, but because she doesn\u2019t get to just tell me what to do and where to do. She didn\u2019t like that, and she said something about how \u201cthe living room and dining room are for everyone\u201d and how she will \u201cmake sure I see that\u201d and proceeded to do yoga with music, chop vegetables, slam drawers, etc, very clearly trying to upset me. I wept but I didn\u2019t retaliate. My mom asked her to stop and she flipped again, going on a similar tirade... so I filmed it again. She jumped me again. Hurled so much verbal abuse that I can hardly remember it all. My dad is spineless and an enabler and even he got in my face, told me I deserved to get attacked because I had the audacity to film her, and called me a worthless piece of shit. And then he told me to leave, and also told me to never speak to him again because I told him to get out of my face and not to yell at me like that.\n\nSo... at some point during this, I said something to my sister like \u201cI wish I could just stab you\u201d or something wild. I was being abused and screamed at and I have PTSD so I was basically in a haze of panic and loss of control... so yeah, I said something a little wild. But I didn\u2019t do anything other than make that comment. I said I wanted to go to the police about her with all my evidence and she keeps saying she\u2019ll tell them I \u201cthreatened her with a knife\u201d if I do. She then said she would sue me and run me into the ground.\n\nI feel sad, stuck, and scared. I feel like I cannot report my abuse now because she has so many threats hanging over me. Part of me knows that my comment is nothing compared to actual violence and abuse she had inflicted on me, but I\u2019m still... scared that reporting will just backfire and I\u2019ll get sued or the police won\u2019t help. I just really, really need advice from people who have an outsider\u2019s perspective. Please help. I need to know if I can help my mother and I have safe lives. Any insight welcome.

He was busy putting the garden in to FEED us...and putting a stereo in the car. \n\nContinued for 25 years of never showing up, being ready to go but barely on time,  changing his mind about going somewhere at the last minute leaving me to go alone or make an excuse to not go, helping everyone around us in the realm of neighbors and his friends, and leaving me to look after everyone and everything at home.

I went up and apologized to him, told him I understood and should never have asked him to come. Told him I was fine and he could go home.

I didn't know if we'd date but I held out hope for a friendship.\n\nShe ended up spending the night and when we woke up the next morning it started up again. The little insults and one liners came fast and furious. Nothing ever enough to make you be offended, but enough to erode my confidence. We began talking about our failed relationship and I mentioned things that I would have done differently, such as enforcing boundaries, and she matter of factly explained that all it would have done was cause a fight. I even had been afraid to say what I would have done since I didn't want to ruin a chance at a friendship.\n\nThe key was when I asked her \"why did you reach out\" and I got \"Do you want the real answer or the nice one? The real answer is that I was drunk.\" That just crushed me, and it all fell into place. What I had explained away as her own shitty behavior because of unresolved abuse in her life was actually a carefully planned tactic of wearing me down over the years to make herself feel better. I realized that the decrease in my self confidence over the last few years coincided exactly with when we first met.\n\nI was supposed to be a one night stand that ended up showing her kindness and affection that she hadn't expected, and as a result it clued her in that I would make a really, really great victim. So I got love bombed, ignored, discarded, then bombed again, etc. The insidious thing about this person is that she herself is a therapist who deals with victims of abuse and I think her knowing exactly how abuse works made her especially good at it.\n\nI won't lie and say that I don't feel something for her. I feel love for the picture of an imperfect and troubled woman that my mind had made. I want to say that I feel pity for the person who she really is, but I'm really not sure. I know I really mourn the relationship that I imaged that we had. I've been reading books and watching Youtube videos about surviving emotional abuse and a few things really resonated with me:\n\n* Nothing I could have done, no amount of love I showed would have changed the situation. When we first met I really wanted to \"fix\" her problems, which I realized was just unhealthy. But I thought that being a perfect supportive boyfriend would be enough. No, it never would have been.\n\n* Abuse like this is deliberate. It's planned. It's intentional. It's not just compatibility, it's not just how things play out. No, everything that happened was designed to break me and give her power over me. Way back in the day I mentioned how it always seemed like she looked down on me and that was dismissed with a \"No, that's crazy.\" I accepted it, but still felt uneasy. And it didn't change.\n\n* It escalates. The last fight we had she shoved me, and I realized that if I had stayed she would have kept getting madder and madder and physical violence would have become a thing.\n\n* There is a reason why she isn't in therapy, or why she's fired every therapist she's had. It's because she doesn't want to change and confront her own demons. Maybe confronting them wouldn't be enough to stop her from being an abuser, but at least as a therapist it's important to self-care in ways other than abusing casual sex and alcohol. \n\n* It wasn't my fault for not leaving sooner. Okay, I'll admit I'm really struggling with this right now because I've always thought that I was strong and had my stuff together, and it's scary to think that someone could show up and I'd willingly let her tear me down for so long. (I knew the relationship was bad from nearly the start.)\n\n* Discarding your victim is probably one of the cruelest acts that an abuser does. And them coming back for a quick drive by is designed to keep you on the hook but far enough away where you don't feel any imagined comfort by their presence. \n\nAnyway this was probably longer than I had wanted it to be but I wanted to put it out there and, while I didn't go into great detail, I hope maybe something here resonated with someone going through what I am right now.\n\nIt's sad. I miss her, I love her. But I finally love myself more.\n\n", "subreddit": "abuse"}

My parents got divorced when I was 12, and my mom got remarried almost immediately. The divorce was final in February, she got married in March. To a man she dated in high school. \n\nAt first, everything was ok. He seemed, not terrible. I was also twelve so it is hard to gauge these things. But soon after things got tough. \n\nMy mom started ignoring me and spending more time away from me. I chalked it up to her hating me. It turns out he was the driving wedge between her and everyone she loved. He got angry at HER for wanting to spend time with her children, wanting to talk to her parents, wanting to go out with friends they didn't share. \n\nHe started getting angry with me for the smallest things. One day I used his laptop for a school project while they were out. I had gotten it from his room. He came home and saw me working on said project. I have never seen someone so angry before then. He called me a snoop, accused me of invading his privacy and having no boundaries, rules, or respect, saying I went through his things and stepped on his toes, so on and so forth. The yelling continued for at least a half an hour. He just repeated everything he said a million times, louder and louder. I cried and apologized and begged him to stop - he didn't listen. And my mom stood by silent. \n\nThese situations, where he would scream at me for something so minute that it just doesn't make sense, happened once a month or so for the next five years. Their fights became more frequent, and I grew to resent my mom and hate living at home. I kept count as to how many days till I turned 18 to leave. I even had a huge fight with ex step dad and lived with my brother for two weeks at one point. I believe I was 14 or 15 then.\n\nAt this point my mom also came to me twice a month or so saying to pack my bags and that we're leaving. Then three hours later I'd see the two of them sitting on the couch, arms wrapped around each other and watching tv smiling. Like nothing ever happened. \n\nI never knew when he would explode. That was the worst part. He would be sickeningly sweet and fun, buy things and promise things that were never happening, and act like he cared for us. Then in an instant, if one wrong thing was said he would turn into the cruelest human I have ever met. I even overheard him calling my mother fat and ugly, to her face. \n\nWe left when I was 17, when he initiated an argument with me that transformed into one with my mom. He ended up throwing our chihuahua on the ground and claiming my mother and I were physically attacking him, when we were just next to him standing in his room. She came to me saying that we were leaving again. But this time we actually did.\n\n\nI'm 21 now and these years I spent there haunt me. I have terrible anxiety and cannot trust. I've been with my SO for near two years and still worry regularly that he doesn't really love me and it's all an act (he is a perfect angel and shows no indications of hating me, and treats me very well) and I hate my mom. We talk only on a superficial level. She barely knows about me or my life, and can't name my friends or what I really want to do. \n\nI don't know how or if I ever will bridge that gap with my mom. I can't see it happening. She has never been able to be completely honest with me. It's always been artificial. And I still get nightmares about my ex step dad. I hope to hell I never see that asshole again. Does anyone have any advice?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I hope I can help someone else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy is it ok for an abuser to yell, scream, insult you, threaten you, and even be violent with you; but for you to even raise your voice would be totally unacceptable to them? Why is it ok for them to treat you in a way that they would NEVER allow you to treat them? I think we are inclined to obsess over the *why?* and knowing the truth can be so freeing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the book *Why Does He Do That?* by Lundy Bancroft (which is excellent, and I recommend to everyone) he describes a man he had counselled for his abusive behavior toward his wife. There had been one incident where he had lifted her up by the throat and slammed her against the wall. He was holding her up, strangling her, and she was of course struggling to get free. She tried to knee him in the balls to get him to release her so she could breathe, and this made him even more angry and he scratched her face, injuring her further. He told this story to his counselor later, furious and as though it was unbelievable. Something along the lines of: \"Can you believe that? She tried to knee me in the balls! How could my own wife disrespect me like that? Of course I lashed out.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I'm paraphrasing, but this story was really eye-opening for me. Obviously this is an extreme example but an abuser can literally be furious at you for trying to save your own life. He can be literally trying to kill you, and believes you have no right to hurt him or defend yourself. It's hard for us to get it, and we'll never truly understand, because this isn't logical or normal human thinking. We don't necessarily need to understand **how** to know that this is what they are capable of.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPart of the answer is that those things that they did or said to you were **your fault**. If you hadn't done the thing that made them so angry, they never would have called you names/hit you/whatever. They HAD to do that, you left them no choice. And then you turn around and behave badly to them AGAIN (raising your voice in response, defending yourself, whatever), and then have the nerve to say they treat you worse, when all of it was your fault in the first place!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother part is entitlement and superiority. They are better than you: smarter, tougher, kinder, more sensitive, more thoughtful. They deserve good treatment for being a good person and a good partner, whereas you do not deserve good treatment. Their attitude is: **you owe me**. They are an excellent partner to you and treat you like gold, whereas you are a terrible partner who constantly disappoints them and makes them angry. How *dare you* raise your voice to them after all they've done for you, and all they've put up with from you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope that makes sense. This is of course utter and complete bullshit, and shows the mental gymnastics required for someone to avoid ever having to take responsibility for their actions. But understanding this was such a breakthrough moment for me, and I wanted to share it. Once again I really recommend the book *Why Does He Do That?* by Lundy Bancroft, which is where all this came from. Knowing the truth of why they do this and what they really think of us makes it so much easier to get yourself free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Abusers truly believe that they are entitled to be angry and you are not, because they believe they are superior to you, they believe that they deserve respect but you do not, and they believe that their anger and abusive treatment was your fault in the first place. They believe that you owe them, and that they owe you nothing. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We hit it off fairly quick and started dating after only knowing each other for a couple months. We dated consistently for 7 years after that.\n\nWe fought a lot, but I never thought it was more than the average couple. It wasn't until I started seeing a therapist in early 2018 that I realized exactly how emotionally abusive Jane had been towards me.\n\nShe would consistently hit below the belt. She would take every opportunity she could to make me feel dumb, like she was superior to me. She would shame me whenever I made a mistake, making me feel 10 times worse than I already did. She would make me feel like I didn't belong around her friends by always talking shit about me towards them. Her friends would tell both Jane and I that she was too good for me. \n\nShe would constantly shift blame and try to make me feel bad for anything that ever happened between us. Somehow every problem in our relationship could always be traced back to me and I had no way of arguing against her sheet ignorance and lack of logic. She lives in a world where she is never wrong.\n\nIt's safe to say that our relationship was mostly held together by our sex life. This was the aspect of our relationship that had the least issues. This was also one of the only ways she showed me affection. She didn't like hugging or cuddling. She didn't like to kiss very much. She didn't like human contact. The only time I was able to be totally comfortable with her was when we were having sex, and that was inconsistent because she has a low sex-drive.\n\nShe cheated on me with her best \"male friend\". To make this more clear, me and this guy always had issues and she knew that. This was literally the worst person she could have cheated on me with. I shamefully forgave her, and tried my best to move on.\n\nOnce we were in college together things only got worse. She would go out drinking 4 nights a week and I was not allowed to come with. She did not like being around me when she was drunk, so I was told to stay home instead. Typically I would sit at home all night and pray that she didn't cheat on me. I honestly still don't know to this day if she cheated on me during those nights.\n\nIn 2014 we had a child together. She was still in college and I had dropped out to work full-time at a crappy job just so we could afford to support our son. After a year of trying to make it work as a family she finally left me for good. She moved 3 states away to distance herself from me and she took our son with her. Now I drive 8 hours to meet with her twice a month so I can see my son for a total of 8 days a month.\n\nJust to make things that much worse she lied and told her entire family that I hit her. This way I couldn't even talk to her family. These were people I had grown to love over the last 7 years, they were basically a second family for me.\n\nI still love her. I have every right to hate Jane, but I don't. I don't know why I still feel the way I do about her. I'm ashamed to admit this to any of my family members, they all treat her like she's the plague, and I know that she deserves it. I haven't even admitted this to my therapist. I just can't bring myself to get over her. There is nothing I want more than to hate her, but I don't.\n\nWe broke up 3 years ago and I still think about her every day. I still have delusions of Jane and I sharing a future with our son together. I hate myself for thinking these things. This is my deepest secret.\n\nTLDR: I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for 7 years before she finally left me and took our son 3 states away.

I\u2019m so thankful of the culture shift today where people are more inclined to believe the abused without question. Being told by people in authority, over and over, that I was a liar, a drama queen, a child with a vivid imagination, or that \u201cit can\u2019t be true because your parents are such good people\u201d made me distrust and fear people in general. It wasn\u2019t the abuse that caused the social anxiety - it was the complete lack of support.\n\nFrom birth my parents resented me. They discovered pretty early on that it\u2019s easy to stop a baby crying through suffocation, an act they joked about for years later. They beat, with hands or weapons, and kicked. They mocked and criticized and threatened abandonment. They refused to let me play or talk or laugh or cry. Any of these things came with punishment. I was stabbed, had broken bones, denied health care, and made to suffer through serious injuries without help. They lied and told others that I was diagnosed with poor motor skills to explain away the injuries. They said I was diagnosed with ADHD and it caused me to make up stories. No one questioned any of it, and they got everyone\u2019s sympathy for having to deal with such a \u201cdifficult child.\u201d As a teen all my needs were ignored, and my mom tried to hook me up with a 35 year old man. I finally got a job without them knowing and moved out. With no life skills, I was quickly taken advantage of, drugged, and raped. But it still felt better than living with my parents.\n\nThere will never be any justice here. There\u2019s no evidence to accuse them of abuse. None of my extended family believes what happened for so long. All the family friends call me a liar. They will only ever believe my abusers. I live a life of fear and uncertainty and ongoing medical complications. They live a life of wealth and comfort.

Bf\u2019s brother finally got himself a car (before he had been using mine to go to and from work, bf is stingy with his car because it\u2019s newer and nicer, therefore no one else can drive it unless is an emergency). We have a two car garage on our house, and before now only bf had been parking inside of it, since the other half was filled with his brother\u2019s boxes. My car has always been outside on the driveway. \n\nNow his brother has a car, moved his own boxes, and is parked inside the garage with bf\u2019s car. Mine is still outside. Not only that, but now I have to park on the street (residential neighborhood, quiet area, but still) because his brother works early in the morning while I work overnight, so parking behind him when I come home is just a bad idea. My boyfriend goes to school, though is bad at attending everyday since he\u2019d rather screw up his sleep schedule and go to bed when he\u2019s supposed to be leaving for class. He didn\u2019t go to class today, nor did he leave the house, so technically I could have parked behind him today. We were sitting in bed when I jokingly griped about not even being able to park in the driveway now, and (not being serious) said I would just start parking behind his car forever. He balked at this and said that\u2019s not happening, he has to go to class everyday, to which I quipped \u201cwell you didn\u2019t go today did you?\u201d.

I don\u2019t know what made me snap out of it, as I\u2019m usually really passive and don\u2019t like to stand up to him, but me doing so actually made him clam up. He made a disapproving noise but didn\u2019t say anything after that. I\u2019m sitting in the bathroom feeling a bit angry as I type this. \n\nHe\u2019s done so well to guide me under his thumb (isolated me from my family and friends, I talk to no one else now that I think about it, and we live out of the city where my parents are, devalues me constantly, emotionally and sexually neglects me, just generally makes me feel like shit whenever I sit down and put all of the pieces together) and I\u2019ve let myself be put there.

He began to reach up my pajama leg, and grope my inner thigh and privates. That is the moment I kicked the shit out of him. I kicked based on subconscious instinct because I was sleeping, but I was waking when I saw him stumble up trying to quietly run back into his own room with his privates in his hand. That's when I realized what had happened. I didn't want to make a scene in the middle of the night, because \"nothing\" technically happened. I couldn't go back to sleep because I was trying to digest what had happened, and what to do. He didn't come out of his room that morning when we left. I didn't care. I've seen him 1 or 2x since that happened. It still irks me when I see him. I hate when my mom mentions him. I've never told my mother, his mother, or anyone for that matter until now. His mother just got me a wedding present. I threw it away because it reminds me of them. I feel so awful for losing this relationship with my \"Aunt\". It's not her fault.

Then, M and I (19F) had a class together. I already knew that he was into me, and I thought he was really attractive too. Then, he became my coworker. \n\nFor a while, M and I flirted a ton. \nIt\u2019s important for you to know that I have an extensive history of abuse, mainly sexual. I am severely traumatized. My sexual development has been hindered, which means that I struggle to feel proper sexual attraction without wanting to cry and I also struggle to be physical with guys to the point where holding hands is too intense for me. \n\nThen there was M who came along. The farthest I went with him was hugging him, but I was intensely attracted to him go the point where I would touch myself to him. That\u2019s a big deal for me because typically, even the thought of another guy touching me cringe in terror and heartbreak, which is not really a turn on when you\u2019re trying to masturbate. \n\nHaving a crush on M was a big deal for me. I was allowing myself to have fun with attraction in a way that I never have been able to before. I\u2019m usually scared to have guys be flirty with me in the way M was, but when he would get close to me or touch me, it felt great. I started to have more faith in humanity, and I reckoned that even if I eventually reached the verdict that he wasn\u2019t good to pursue further, he would at least have the consideration to not sexually assault me. I know that sounds extreme, but my default mindset is that every man is out to get me (I know that\u2019s bad. I\u2019m working on it.). \n\nFast forward a few weeks and we make plans to study, and he just doesn\u2019t show up. When I asked him about it at work, he started talking about how he was busy with the company he owns, and that I should buy a pair of leggings that he is selling. In that moment I was like ok clearly this person has no respect for me, and so he is no longer worth my time, and I was so okay with that. In fact,  the whole experience was really restorative, because it allowed me to step back and realize that there\u2019s definitely an in between. Not every guy is either going to protect me or hurt me. I was glad to have the experience of feeling sexy getting that attention and being sexually attracted to M, but I also felt great moving on as soon as I realized he didn\u2019t have respect for me. \n\nThen one day J told me that M doesn\u2019t work at our job anymore. I knew that something bad had happened by the way that he said it. J and M lived together and had been close friends ever since they started college. \nThen one night, J tells me that he fired M because 4 girls had gone up to him and said that M had raped them. There were other details that J was vague about that lead him to the conclusion that this definitely happened. J and I are very close and this is not something that he would lie about. \n\nThat was a few months ago. \n\nSince then, I have been destroyed. Looking back, there\u2019s an incident in which M said something very rapey towards me that could have been interpreted in two ways. At the time, I went with the explanation that it was just him being nervous around me, since that was the more rational explanation. My trauma can often lead me to be quite paranoid, so I\u2019m often afraid of nothing. Now I look back and I\u2019ll never forget what his voice sounded like. It was dark and twisted and sadistic, as if he wanted to do really bad things to me. I\u2019ve also had another friend tell me about an incident in which M was very rapey towards one of her friends (he was lying on this girl\u2019s bed trying to get her to sleep with him. He only left when the girl got her other friends to force him to leave). \n\nFor the remainder of last semester, I had to watch M flirt with other girls in our class, and they were putty in his hands. He did it right in front of me. They fell for it, just like I did, and just like so many girls have before. I was just another pawn, but he\u2019s been a fucking catastrophic disaster in mine. \n\nHe\u2019s now back in his home country facing charges, but at the same time, he\u2019s never left, and I am ruined. \n\nI am horrified at this truth, and I\u2019m sorry if I get graphic here - I have never been so turned on by anyone in my life. He was the first boy that I\u2019ve been so consistently sexually attracted to in that way, and I\u2019ve rarely came that hard thinking about another person. And he is a serial rapist. \nAnd of course my attraction for him is nonexistent now, but at one point, having him be my first was a possibility that I was excited about. And it sickens me to think of all of the times where I would fantasize about him doing those things to me. I never want to see his disgusting face again. \nIt took me so long to get to the point of being open to loving someone again. I would\u2019ve been totally okay if he turned out to just be a fuckboy, but the fact that I so narrowly avoided raped is so terrifying to me. \n\nNow, my trauma has gotten worse. A whole new dimension of hurt is present now. I thought I had trust issues before, man.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. There\u2019s this really cute boy who works in my dining hall. We are both very intensely attracted to each other. He\u2019s tried to ask me out twice, but on both occasions, something has happened that has prevented him. I\u2019ve spoken to him once, and I honestly don\u2019t even know his name. \n\nBut I find myself thinking of this boy from the dining hall when I touch myself now. And the last time I was like that with a boy, he turned out to be a serial rapist, so my mind can\u2019t help but say that what makes this boy different?\n\nProblem is I\u2019m so ruined mentally. I am so afraid that he is going to hurt me. I can\u2019t stop hearing that phrase in my head\u2014\u201che\u2019s gonna hurt you.\u201d That phrase has haunted me for years of my life, but it\u2019s gotten back again ever since I found out about M. And I want to be brave and ask him out, but I\u2019m so destroyed inside and I don\u2019t think I could handle a relationship. I\u2019m currently seeking professional help for these problems I have. I am very mentally ill. In the mean time I don\u2019t know what to do. This boy is really good looking, and I\u2019m so worried that he\u2019s going to find another girl before I can even talk to him. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for getting graphic here. Please be gentle, especially when referring to me touching myself, as my history of sexual trauma makes it incredibly difficult to talk about this. ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

And have never had a \"real\" consensual sexual encounter.** \n\nWhen I was 2/3, my second cousin molested me. He was 12. My mom was able to figure out what happened and told my family. My dad wouldn't believe that something like that could happen. His sister called me a liar (reminder, I was 2 or 3 years old). We never spoke to that side of our family again and my dad came around after talking to a child psychologist. That psychologist told my parents to never mention the incident until I do, which was the right decision in hindsight. They also told my parents that children who were sexually abused in the formative years either go one of two ways: becoming overly sexualized and at an early age or be sexually repressed, like me. Its more common for people to become over sexualized. \n\nI grew up feeling a grey area in my memory, having a feeling that something happened but being terrified to ever bring it up. When my sister brought that cousin up once, I had a quiet panic attack. It wasn't until I was 20 years old that I was finally ready to ask my mom about what happened to me. On;y then did I finally realize just how my personality, actions and behavior have been affected by the actions of my cousin. \n\nI remember driving in the car with my dad or brother and being worried that they would look too closely at the seat belt cutting across my preteen boobs. When all of my friends were getting boyfriends and getting their first kisses in high school, there I was too petrified to talk to a boy I liked; it was different than the typical teenage flusters of awkwardness. I literally couldn't bare the idea of getting close to anyone. My trust issues with men originated with my cousin and was exacerbated after hearing about the sexual abuse my sisters have received from their peers. One of my sisters was actually raped by two different boyfriends. \n\nI am 23 years old now. It was only a few months ago that I took a big step in my healing process. I danced with a boy I had just met ( we had a lot in common and were from the same home town). It wasn't grinding even, I had my arms around his neck and we were swaying to the music in a club. For all intents and purposes for normal people, it was such a minor thing. But, for me, this was a huge step in overcoming my trust issues and fears about being sexualized by men. \n\nThere is a lot of shame associated with not being sexually experienced by my age in this society. When I was 18 and just graduated from high school, most people had already had their first kiss except me and my best friend. She finally sealed the deal and told me all about it. When I confessed that I wanted it to happen soon, she said, \"Some people just develop slower than most.\" That statement, as small as it was, was a heavy blow. It singled me out as other or different; it hurt a lot and brought up a lot of shame that I was avoiding. \n\nI am alone in the way I handle the dating scene. I don't date because dating comes with the assumption of physical intimacy. The only way I have been able to get close to any of that is after being treated like a person first and making an emotional connection. I am secure in myself now, but I still hope to connect with people like me. I am happy to wait for the right person to come along who will be patient and understanding. \n\n**Point is: I haven't heard of stories like mine. If there is anyone out there that looks at life differently like I do, please comment and share. I feel alone in the way I view the world.** ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I use to be very sexual with my husband and now it's like I pray for it to be over once he is inside. I love him and do feel attracted but it's like my body shuts down during. I love him so much and recently broke down and told him how much I hate sex anymore. I cry sometimes during it and let my mind go somewhere else. I started to have flashbacks of possible sexual abuse in my past as a child about 10 years ago but only now has it really affected anything sexual.   \nI was physically abused for 5 years of my life by my father and watched him beat and rape my mother. I was left alone with him on the weekends after the courts forced me to still see him after he tried to rape my mother on the apartment steps and door and I stopped it. He punched me so hard I bashed my head into a coffee table and remember only bits and pieces of anything leading up to it and nothing after really. He beat me several times while alone with him and remember him doing drugs in front of me with his new girlfriend. I remember his friends coming over and being naked often and the girlfriends son being left in the room with men coming in and out.  After a while he wouldn't let me back to his place and told me he never loved me and that's the last I saw of him.   \nI know my mothers first ex husband for my father use to creep me out and touch me and other kids also but most of that is blocked out besides the fact that I always hated being around him alone or with other kids and always hid near my mom when  he was around. He always wanted to tickle and grab at me and pin me. I never felt comfortable.   \nMy mother became physically and mentally abusive after my mother left. She didn't always hit me but when she did she left marks and it was out of no where.  From bloody noses from crying that I wanted to go home and sleep and not be at someone else house at 12am on a school night, to me just using the restroom at 2am and being punched in the throat. She became less physical as I got older and more mental. She even stated when I came out to her that my father hurt me (I was 12 when I came out to tell her this, he was last around when I was 5) she told me I was a liar. I never brought it up till many years later. She would not let me leave the house and not let me go out to make friends. She would tell me how no man will ever love so only marry for money from an old man so when he dies I don't have to deal with men again. She would talk to me as young as 10 about her sex life with her new boyfriend and adult conversations she should be having with a friend. She would scream at me out of no where for something I didn't do or get angry for me doing something that helped her out and yell if I didn't do it. I found out a few years ago she has Bi Polar and possible other mental health issues and she never took the meds.   \nI know that was a long rant but not sure if any of it could help with why I suddenly just...can't function sexually. Even Masturbation and foreplay doesn't feel good as good half the time. My husband blamed himself for a while and I feel so bad. He is trying his best to be patient and understand my needs but I don't even know them. Over the past year it's just been getting worse, even if I do get in the mood the minute it goes in I want it out and don't want him near me. ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

But now, I'm looking for feedback, and I'll scroll through and see if I've got any helpful advice to deliver.  That said, bear w me, I'm gonna try to condense 10-11 years into an explanation for how a 4'7, 98 pound chick has a 6'5, 220 pound dude so shook.\n\nI met her when she was 18, and I had just gotten back from overseas. I'm a combat veteran, and I was injured. When I met her, I was still using a wheelchair to get around. I was 23.\n\nWhen I met her at a party, I actually thought my mind had snapped. I had heard about dudes breaking from the stress overseas, and when she turned around, I thought she was a ghost. There had been a civilian who died, a female, whom I felt personally responsible for, and my ex, when I first saw her; looked so similar I thought I was seeing things. I didn't even address her. I was afraid that no one else could see her. So I didn't acknowledge her, I hung out w my friends, and I glanced at her from across the room a few times. She remained seated, watching tv from the floor.\n\nFinally, someone introduced us, and I felt this huge rush of relief, that she wasn't the ghost of a dead girl, or an image burnt into a broken mind. We talked, she had a boyfriend, so I backed off. Then, one day, her cousin, who happened to be a good friend of mine, called me up and told me his cousin (I didn't know their relation at the time, so I didnt know who he was talkin' about) was being abused by her bf, and asked if I could provide him some back up to go get her out of the house. I agreed. I was surprised to find out it was the same girl from the party. Somethin' about her needing me in that moment made me connect her to the girl from overseas whom I had helplessly watched die. This was my second chance, I had thought, my second chance to save the girl from overseas. So I barreled forward, and to breeze past the finer details, dealt w her (now) ex boyfriend, and made certain she was safely escorted to her ma's house.\n\nWithin a few days she and I were dating. I don't remember who made the leap and asked to be dating, but if I had to guess; I'd say it was me. I was utterly smitten w her, and I was healing. I associated my rise from wheelchair to a walker, and a walker to a cane w dating her. Despite the fact that by the time I had helped her escape her ex bf, I was already walking w a cane. I made up this sort of fantasy wo ever really knowing I had done it. I was able to make sense of the girl from overseas dying, by convincing myself the universe delivered a second chance, and everything sorta played into that fantasy. My health and recovery. Her happiness. It was all to save this other chick who had died.\n\nAnyway... fast forward a couple years, and we were engaged. I noted that she had a tendency to fly off the handle, but she was younger than me, so I dealt w it by just weathering the storm, and keeping my head down. Then, 3 years in, 1 year engaged, she cheated. I had told her that was my line when we first started dating. The one thing I couldn't forgive was cheating. I took her aside when the dude she cheated w cried to me in my car, cuz he thought I was gonna throw him a beatin'. I didn't, mostly because I didnt believe him. So I took her aside, away from our first son, and spoke calmly and plainly. I told her I knew she cheated and I specifically said, \"I believe you kissed him, but I know you're not a whore, I know you didnt just fuck him on the side of the road...\" at which point she cut me off, crying, and told me \"I am a whore that fucked him on the side of the road.\" Turns out.. she literally did that, which sucked, but I told her then, \"I wont be able to forgive this dude, but you're a good person and a good ma, don't let this make you question that, or allow it to reflect on your parenting.\"\n\nThat shoulda been it. But I adored her. She swore she cheated cuz she thought I was gonna leave her, and she had a childhood filled w sexual assault. She thought I'd leave because I had reconnected w an old friend that hated her. She made a lot of assumptions from there. But I believed her, I WANTED to believe her, and I forgave her. We stayed together, moved, and things actually sorta got better. She was much more passionate about her love for me, and I returned that passion. We spent another 4 years together (7 total at this point) before she cheated again... and for the same reasons.\n\nNow, its important to note, I'm no angel. I have ptsd, and thoughts that race and leave me sorta ... difficult to deal with. Im not a monster, but when my thoughts race I have a hard time communicating. It makes it seem like Im heartless, cold, or I guess like a monster. Not because im aggressive, but because I sorta shutdown and pull away. I guess I seem distant. When she cheated again, I didn't have another kind, understanding speech for her. I was hurt. I left her. Moved out, cut off communication. For the briefest moments, I stopped connecting her to the girl from overseas. She was just a girl from my hometown, and my hometown is notorious for trashy behavior... lots of trailer parks and projects smashed together in a town which experienced a population spike from 28k to 60k in just shy of 5 years.\n\nAnywho, she wielded my son against me like a weapon. He's not mine, biologically. I've been his dad ever since he called me that when he was 3. I met him the day he turned 2, though, and I've considered him mine ever since. So does he, so does she. But when I left, she wanted me back, and refused to let me see my son unless I agreed to at least talk w her and consider getting back together. During this time, she started a weird campaign of convincing me that I'm wrong in the head. Now, granted, there ARE legitimate claims supporting that, in general. I have ptsd, I have a traumatic brain injury that caused a change in some of my personality. But unless you knew me as a kid, you wouldn't recognize the change caused by the brain injury. It just made me sorta... hermity. Im not an extrovert anymore, and things seem to matter more to me, than they used to, insults, compliments, politics, generalizations. I dunno, but I own a home, entirely paid off, I own 4 vehicles, all paid off, I raise my sons as a single father just fine, and they both do well in school... so I mean.. problems, but not a crazy person that can't fit in society, I don't think.\n\nBut she would insert little false memories... she'd change history while we talked, and I'd allow it because she'd brush off my contention by saying, \"dude, you're just not remembering, have you taken your meds today? Maybe you're just having a hard time remembering because its time to visit the doc\" .. yknow.. nothing abrasive, but clearly asserting I'm not viewing reality as is. And I fell for that... it excused her cheating.. sure she cheated, but I didnt remember how much it hurt her for me to seem distant. I didn't remember how I told her I hated her. I still don't, and to date, despite being a stoner, my memory rarely comes into question. My friends dont tell me I'm always forgetting things. My four sisters never make fun of me for it, and trust me, they would. My parents dont think there's any issue. Further, and perhaps more importantly, none of my doctors have ever mentioned that my memory has been affected. FFS, I still remember a dream from when I was in a crib. The idea that I forgot telling my angel, who represented my atonement at the time, that I hated her is laughable... but she claimed that thats where the cheating was born. So be it.\n\nI took that fault onto myself, and forgave her again. I had to, because essentially I believed it was my fault at this point. She built this narrative in our relationship painting me as a full blown lunatic. Not the aggressive mean kind. The totally impaired, doesnt exist in reality kind. Kinda like how schizophrenics are portrayed in movies. My docs gave me more meds, according to the descriptions my fiancee (at the time) gave them. I encouraged her, in fact, to tell them what she was witnessing, since I was so out of my mind that I couldn't remember any of it. I became very afraid. And Im not a fearful person, but I was terrified of myself... I couldn't control what she was saying I was doing.. because I wasn't actually doing any of it. Thats not denial, thats objective fact that I didn't come to accept until later, and only after witnesses and VA docs took time to sorta, deprogram the mind control I had allowed her to exert over me.\n\nDespite all the mind games, I thought I was still happy. I thought we all were, and she became pregnant. W my son! I had two first sons now! My oldest was my first child, and she was now pregnant w the first child I ever had a hand in making! My oldest son and I grew much closer, because I made extra certain to cement in his mind that I was the luckiest dad in the world cuz I had TWO first sons, and his importance would never dwindle just because my youngest existed and was blood related. We had father son days every saturday, and I introduced him to dumb shit I loved as a kid like DragonBall Z (i still dont think its dumb. lol.. well.. everything after frieza is kinda lame, but thats neither here nor there). We had been close before, but we were like best buds. He never complained that I forgot things, nor that I said weird out of character things. He never witnessed me being mean to his mother, or telling her I hated her. He was blissfully unaware she had ever cheated, and thought his mother and I had broken up because I had a mental break down, because thats what I told him.\n\nFast forward through the pregnancy, + 2 years, and I've got 2 sons, a fiancee, and a house w a floating dock and a boat. We were living a pretty comfortable life in northern california, away from our sorta slummy beginnings in central/west maryland. I loved my life. I worked at a dispensary! As an east coaster, working at a medicinal marijuana dispensary was so novel to me I literally whistled while I worked. Well... my (still) fiancee, at the time, hadn't worked in the entirety of our 9 or 10 years together at that point. She had quit working when she began dating me, because I was a bit more well to do than she was used to. I had a huge chunk of loot dropped in my lap after being crippled while active duty. I had a regular compensation check that more than covered our way of life. So for 9 or 10 years we had spent nearly every minute together until I had that dispensary job. At that point I guess I was distant again, because she cheated. She cheated and then tried to take my sons from me.\n\nNow, during this story I've not claimed to have done any of the things she said I did. I believed it enough to accept responsibility for it, but according to our circle of friends, I was being used and abused. But when she came after my sons, I drew a line. I kicked her out of my house, not like, physically, I mean, I told her to leave. She moved in w one of our mutual friends, (who would later kick her out on her birthday, because of her behavior around her kids) began drinking and druggin' heavily and would show up at 2 in the morning and demand to see our kids, and I'd refuse. Id tell her to come back sober, which she'd refuse to do. She said she needed to get drunk or do meth to build her courage to see me. I mentioned in the beginning, Im a giant compared to her. Even if I had never once raised my voice, I understand thats intimidating for her to face, but she wasn't gonna be drunk or drugged around my sons. So when she claims I didn't let her see them... its true. Not quite in the context she declares it, but generally, it's true.\n\nAnyway... I moved back to the east coast w my sons. Before I did, she and I had agreed not to go through the courts to establish rights, we'd be civil and talk between us, but I got her to sign a notarized statement saying she was fully aware I'd have my oldest son (since hes not mine biologically) and my youngest w me, that I'd care for them, that they'd visit her family and mine, and that she and I would continue to discuss visitation between us. A week later I moved back to the east coast, and 4 months after that she was pregnant again. W someone elses kid...\n\nIts been nearly 4 years now. She spent large chunks of time never calling or visiting my boys. She actually NEVER came to see them. She only ever called or texted to fight w me and tell me I suck, or a couple of times she musta been drunk cuz she'd ask me to take her back.\n\nThis past December she called me and told me she was living w her mom in our hometown. She wanted to meet up and talk, and see the boys. She sounded healthy, and strong, and not on drugs. I was so proud of her, I believed her and brought our sons to see her. Every chance she got when they weren't paying attention she told me I was crazy. I've tried to be civil w her, and every time she still hits me w the head games, and it sorta worked. She had me going for a little bit, made me think I was crazy again... until someone pointed out that she had left her ex, taken their baby, and moved in w her mother, her youngest sister, and a few guys that had slept w both her mother and her youngest sister.\n\nShe's seen my sons 3 or 4 times since december, but shes already in love again, this time w her sisters ex boyfriend, whom shes attempting to marry w a jop (this is mad common in our home town, no one has weddings, they all just line up outside of the court house, chain smoking cigarettes and yelling at one another over who slept w who's ex). My sons birthday alone is gonna cost 250 bucks. Thats w no presents. He wants another xbox one (cuz his is damaged)... thats another 250. And his mother has repeatedly declined to throw anything towards that (she never has). Now that shes closer I thought she'd wanna be involved, and pitch in. No, she wants to spend money on the jop w her sisters ex, and a carton of smokes.\n\nMoney, btw, which would require her to lie to the IRS, and claim my sons on taxes. Anyway... now I find myself defending my parenting, and my character from this woman... and it scares me... terrifies me, really... because she always finds a way into my head. I don't defend myself when it comes to her... I still see that chick that died. I still feel so fuckin' responsible for her death, and I'm so desperate to be square w the house, that I keep letting this pale imitation (my kids ma), push me around.\n\nShe's essentially telling me I have to give her the boys socials so she can claim them on taxes, or she'll take them from me, because I'm crazy and unfit to be a parent. And even though its been all this time... when she calls me crazy, its like the bell for pavlov's dogs.\n\nIf you've managed to read all of this, I'd appreciate anything in the way of advice. Im really at a loss for what I should do. I feel like I can't fight for custody cuz I made a promise to her that we wouldn't involve the courts... even though shes threatening to do exactly that now, I dont wanna break my promise.\n\nThanks for letting me vent.\n\nTL:DR - I'm worried the chick that emotionally abused me for like 10 or 11 years is gonna convince me or bully me into letting her take my sons from me.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I was washing a load when he appeared so i let him crash for about 50 mins while the dryer finished. when it was done i went to wake him up, softly and respectfully. I said \u201cbabe get up, i need to put sheets on the bed so that we can sleep comfortably\u201d, and he wouldn\u2019t move- so i keep trying. I tried a little harder and explained that i didn\u2019t want to sleep on a bare mattress and that i needed him to get up to which he replied \u201cfuck off let me sleep. \u201c\n\n\nAfter a few tries more he finally came through and told me to \u201cgo fuck myself and let him sleep\u201d to which i replied \u201cwell if you\u2019re gonna be a mean asshole i need you to get out of my house, i was just trying to get you comfortable. You\u2019re either an asshole or you sleep in me house but not both\u201d. I lost it and i yelled and i told him to leave repeatedly and he wouldn\u2019t. \n\n\nHe got really angry and started screaming. Foaming in the mouth. Yelling all sorts of abusive shit. I went and hid in the next room and locked myself in. He kept pounding it until he opened it.  Then he locked himself in there with me and blocked the door so he could scream more abuse at me.  I begged him to let me out. He wouldn\u2019t. \n\n\nEventually after about 2.5 hours of him yelling  someone called the police. It was the only thing that calmed him down. I finally fell asleep in my room at around 2 am.  He slept on the couch cause he was too drunk to drive. \n\n\nToday he\u2019s justifying his actions saying  that i caused the whole thing. Now he\u2019s saying he doesn\u2019t remember what he said and that he reacted like because i bitched at him and kicked him out of my apartments in the first place. He doesn\u2019t even live here. And i don\u2019t think being drunk and not remembering is a free pass to treat someone however you want. I got mad in the first place because of the way he spoke to me. \n\n\nAnyway i want to break up. But i would like some good language tools on how to speak to him. I know I can\u2019t fix a person but maybe i can help him realize that the reason he is losing me is because of his own creation.  How do i speak to someone who\u2019s mentally justifying themselves so much that they don\u2019t understand reasoning? What can i say to get through to the other person that can resonate with them and make them realize its their own fault and wrongdoing??", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He will always bite my neck very hard. It has started making me uncomfortable because he will do it when I'm putting in my contact lenses or something completely \"outside\" of bedroom behavior. It's tricky because I think he thinks he's being playful and keeping our passion alive. But it feels invasive. In the past, he has punished me for trying to stick up for my own physical and emotional boundaries, so I'm too scared to address him.

He has also passed it on to me to the point I was concerned surgery may be cancelled.

Surgery went on as planned though I have a night time cough from drainage that is not great after abdominal surgery. \n\nThe list of BS over the last 24 hours is too much to type, I\u2019ve tried twice and moved the draft posts to my journal because they\u2019re book chapters (that happens a lot for me, I use too many words).

I just need some serious advice. I really appreciate you taking the time to read. I met my ex at work because I worked at his family\u2019s business. He immediately captivated me. He was handsome, a firefighter, smart, funny, and seemed so kind. We instantly hit it off. Things were amazing, like the best relationship I had ever been in. We were completely in love (or so it seemed.) I completely trusted him.\n\nHe proposed to me two months into our relationship. I said yes. My friends and family were a bit skeptical because of how fast we were moving. I told them that this person was the one for me and I was confident in our relationship and could not be happier. We went on a mini vacation to the beach to celebrate and had an amazing time together. I noticed he had some habits of searching up girls he used to be affiliated with on Instagram. Everytime I\u2019d ask him about it, he would tell me he never did that and I was crazy. I sort of shrugged it off but thought it was weird.\n\nFast forward about 8 months later. We are moved in together in our own apartment and things seem great. It\u2019s my birthday, I just turned 21. We were going to a club where we both got quite drunk. I noticed I could not find him anywhere near me when we were in the club. He was always in the corner or in the restroom, on his phone. I walked with him back to our hotel room and he sat on the couch and started playing on his gaming laptop. I asked him to spend the rest of the evening with me since it was my birthday and I wanted to watch TV with him. He told me no. I went down to the car to grab something and then came back up. I noticed he was on his phone acting weird. I looked at his screen and realized he was on Instagram on a fake profile messaging his ex girlfriend. His username included a pet name he used to call her as well as the date they got together. He could not explain why he was on this account, so he smashed his phone on the ground repeatedly and punched a hole in the wall. I was terrified and crying all night long. I was so confused as to why someone would do this especially since things seemed to be going so well in our relationship.\n\nThe next morning he acted so cold to me. I tried to ask him why he did what he did and why he was on a fake account, but he said \u201cYeah I was completely aware of what I was doing.\u201d He told me it was to make me \u201cjealous.\u201d I did not believe that one bit. I tried so hard to forgive him and move past everything but my conscience was screaming at me. He and I agreed to get off of social media for a long time together. \n\nThe next months were a struggle for me. I was paranoid, anxious, and had a hard time trusting him. He was not willing to prove to me when he made that account by logging in and showing me the account data. He told me he forgot the Instagram password. He said that he\u2019s pretty sure he made it that night at the club, but I could not believe that at all. I noticed she was in his searches on his regular Instagram. Like I said from that point on, I had severe trust issues. He would look at other women up and down in front of me, he started gaming almost every evening instead of coming to bed with me, and he started acting more selfish. I felt like I had to go through his phone to see if he\u2019d been unfaithful again. I would get anxiety while I was at my college if someone was over our apartment right now, and I couldn\u2019t tell if he even loved me in the first place anymore. With this I became so depressed. I started gaining weight and not sleeping at night. I was constantly thinking he was going to become violent or cheat on me again, and I\u2019d question him if he loved me or if there was anything going on to please tell me.\n\nThings got better in time, it seemed, I stopped worrying as much about what happened that night.\n\nIn November, he had his nursing school orientation. There, he met this blonde girl who he\u2019d had a class in high school with. He told me about her after coming home, and I instantly felt a pang of worry. I noticed he scoured social media to try to find her one night after he was laying in bed next to me on Facebook. During a drunken argument, he told me he was going to get to know \u201cthat hot blonde girl so well.\u201d I felt like it was happening again, the worry, the cheating, I felt like I was in a ticking time bomb. I was so paranoid I would openly ask him if he was going to replace me. He told me no, there is nothing to worry about. I noticed she had a long term boyfriend as well, so maybe there really wasn\u2019t anything to worry about.\n\nI will add He failed his drug test for nursing school and completely went psychotic. He smashed his face with his hands, ripped his clothes, and almost punched another hole in the wall. I started crying because I was so scared. I thought he was going to become violent towards me. He used fake urine and somehow passed the second test.\n\nHe started bringing cologne to school, a toothbrush, toothpaste, and dry shampoo in his backpack. (He would brush his teeth at home first ..) He started coming home a bit later than I thought he would. I had a nightmare and something told me to check his bank account. I noticed he was spending money for TWO on smoothies, lunch, etc.. triangulating.\n\nWhen I confronted him and asked him, he told me I was psychotic for going through his things. I even saw his recently used emojis while he was texting and they were blonde. He blocked all of his nursing school contacts in his phone for some odd reason. He then changed his phone password and turned off his notifications. I asked him why he\u2019d do all these things including block his friends numbers, and he told me I needed to trust him more. I knew it was happening again. His mom got diagnosed with cancer and I was there that day holding her while we cried. He was at Panera bread having lunch with that girl. I asked him if he wanted to see his mom and he told me he wanted to go to a beer fest instead that night. \n\nI asked him finally if everything was okay between us because it didn\u2019t feel like it. He then threw me out of our apartment with no mercy. He watched me cry my eyes out as I took down all my decorations. I had no idea what was even happening anymore. I asked him what I could do to save our relationship, do I give him space, etc. He was very persistent on getting me out and had no empathy.\n\nI had to move home with my dad. The next night, my neighbor calls me to tell me that she just saw him and that blonde girl at a fancy restaurant we JUST went to together. He then took her back to the apartment. I was in total shock. I asked him why and how could he do something like this to me. He lied and tried to say it was not her, and they were studying in a group and NEVER went back to the apartment. The next morning, her notes from school and her leftovers were in my refrigerator, and it looked like she had been in our bed. Her hair was on the blanket on the couch. He told me that I was responsible for the downfall of this relationship, that I pushed him away by hounding him and not giving him space. He told me it was all my fault that I\u2019m bipolar and my moods ruined our relationship. She blocked me on social media and so did her cousin, and she eventually like two weeks later dumped her poor boyfriend.\n\nI was destroyed inside. I have been destroyed honestly. But then, he came back. He texted me a huge apology (hoover) and told me he just wants to see me and explain his side of things. Me, vulnerable and stupid, decides to meet him at our apartment. I cried my eyes out to him asking why he would do this to me again. He told me he was not seeing or even talking to that girl (her name just then comes up as a snapchat notification) and then he told me he does not even have snapchat. Well we decide to go eat something for some reason, and he actually gets me drunk. We go back to the apartment where I sit on the couch with my eyes closed, and he starts making out with me. I should\u2019ve told him to stop, but I gave in because it felt like there were sparks again. I thought maybe this could save our relationship, if he remembered what being with me was like. He told me he loved me during sex, and then it was over. I left and went home, feeling so confused and pretty dead inside. He texted and said let\u2019s do it again sometime.\n\nFoolishly, I let it happen two more times. He gave me false hope that we were going to work things out as a couple, and to give him time, and a clean slate. He told me that I could not hold on to anything he had done at all and to give him a fresh start (which in my heart did not seem fair.) He would text me that he needed my help to study, or that he missed me, and it would always end up as us sleeping together. I cannot rationalize to you why I let this happen other than I have been so weak and this is me taking his manipulative bait. \n\nThis past Friday was our last meet up, again, it ended in sex. He barely talked to me all weekend, except to answer my question of \u201care you just wanting to sleep with me and that\u2019s it\u201d. He told me he wants more than just to sleep with me. He started ignoring me for the rest of the weekend. He was not putting any effort into fixing our relationship like he told me he wanted to do. I noticed on Instagram that random people were requesting to follow me, and I noticed that it was the friends of the girl he took to dinner. They live in a different city, and he was following them and also following the girl\u2019s cousin who blocked me. It was evident he was still talking to her and maybe even seeing her romantically like I suspected. I could not believe it. I let him use me again, and I finally got the courage to text him how I felt. I told him that he was already fucking around on her by sleeping with me, and how could I be so foolish as to think he actually loved me. He told me to shut the fuck up and that I\u2019ll never change, he does not want to talk to me while I\u2019m in these \u201cmoods\u201d. He writes me off every single time I bring up a valid point or emotion as being in a \u201cmood.\u201d I told him he was so mean and putting me on the shelf as a second option or when he\u2019s horny after already discarding me is the most fucked up thing ever. He then blocked my number. \n\nI\u2019ve been struggling, friends. I cry a lot. I miss the old him, the one I described to you in the beginning. He has made me believe I am the problem and that I have bipolar disorder because I would be having an okay day with him, and then instantly start thinking about the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d. I think at times that I deserved this pain. I think that I caused him to do these things somehow, that is what he\u2019s told me at least. Everything used to be so beautiful and easy and fun. Can anyone offer their insight of my situation and maybe some help as to how to get through this? I have just started my no contact journey. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Posting on mobile so forgive my formatting.\n\nI (F26) have been married for 6 years, 10 years together to a (33M) who I'm pretty sure is a narcissist.\n\nA little back story, 3 kids together, very rocky relationship, pregnant at 17, on and off for a few years until he decided he wanted a relationship, moved in one month, engaged the next, married the month after. I know I know. Bad decision. But I was young and just wanted the family unit. If only I'd know his coworkers didn't even know about me let alone we had a kid together.\n\nSo, here we are now. 3 kids later, and I've finally pulled my head out of my ass. Ever since I decided I can't do this anymore, we are in separate bedrooms, starting with him in the basement, then he forced me into the basement with an ultimatum of move downstairs or get out of the house. I didn't have anywhere to go, especially with three kids so I grey rocked myself into the basement. Didn't let him see it bothered me or affected me in any way.\n\nI'm trying to keep this short without a massive wall of text. The behavior that leads to think he is a narcissist consists of\n- changing his taxes to single, (paycheck cut of 30-40%) because he \"needs to do things for himself and he's not going to let me screw him over on taxes\"\n- has admitted to intentionally leaving messes to see how long it takes me to clean up after him\n- when he does clean its because it's \"disgusting and I don't do a good enough job\"\n- will tell me one thing, when I bring it up later he insists I remembered it wrong and he never said anything like that\n- tells me he can grab my ass or tits whenever he wants because I'm \"bought and paid for\" because of the expensive ring (that he spent to much on, he never wanted to spend that much)\n- encourages me to get my hair done, buy new clothes once I lost weight, then berates me because we don't have money to pay the bills; the real problem being if I spend $5 on coffee when I go grocery shopping, he spends several hundred because \"we agreed not to spend extra money so if your going to do it so will I\"\n- is a raging alcoholic but if I go out once a month I'm a bad mom because I'd rather drink than take care of my kids\n- gets drunk and yells at me, expects me to want to have sex with him after he tells me I'm a shitty mom because I don't make a pancake breakfast every day.\n\nEtc. It makes me sick even typing some of this out. \n\nI keep alternating between deleting it all because I feel stupid staying with him for this long, telling myself it's not that bad because other people have it worse, and feeling like I said to much already and no one has time to read everything.\n\nHas anyone ever started to take on the traits of the other person so much that they start to wonder if they're the narcissist?

{"post_id": "aq0mc4", "created_utc": 1550018958, "title": "TL;DR Why has she done this stuff for years", "author": "Faraway62018", "self_text": "I was in high school as a younger boy. She was an older girl. She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say boo.She began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We\u2019d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends help.When I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said \"Nobody else is as big as you\". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.\n\nAs I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.\n\nWell now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything. She has dated other guys and dated a guy while doing this stuff and just doesn't stop. I made my IG public and screens hotted a funny post from a site I frequent. Days later she posts on that site a question about finding the one and it is just a rant and talking about other guys under her name. Created an account just to post that and never went back on.\n\nI am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it.\n\nPS: I am autistic but on the high functioning end of the spectrum and not everyone knows it or thinks it but I struggle with social cues and such.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

{"post_id": "aq1oem", "created_utc": 1550025809, "title": "Was my childhood bad? Help.", "author": "kayla-nicole", "self_text": "EDITED: Corrections.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry in advance for how long this post is going to be and no, there\u2019s no TL;DR. For some reason, I have a very hard time distinguishing if my childhood was bad, normal, or somewhere in between. To make things simple, I\u2019m going to list everything, or at least most things that I\u2019ve went through from the ages of 6-17. But first I should be clear on my upbringing before I get to the abuse part, it\u2019s long but I don\u2019t want anyone to be confused, that\u2019s all.\n\nI\u2019m an African American female, and currently nineteen years old. My mother had me, her first born, when she was 23 years old with my father who was 34. I am my father\u2019s only child. By the time I was born, they had been dating for three years. After I was born, my father stayed in and out of jail for reasons that he never shared with me. A couple of months after my birth, they separated and never got back together. So I never had the feeling of seeing my parents together as a couple and I only saw him on the weekends when I would stay at his place.\n\nWhen I was about a year old, my mother had dropped out of university and got a new boyfriend. We\u2019ll call him J. By the time I could talk, I was forced to call him Dad, meaning I was calling two different men Dad. She stayed with him for about eight years, and had two children by him. I never treated my half-siblings less than my siblings but I do remember feeling distant from them in a slight way. Their parents were together, and they had the same two parents. I, however, couldn\u2019t relate.\n\nDuring their relationship, my mother was enrolled in a community college. She was always being beat and RUTHLESSLY cheated on. I used to always tell my mom whenever I saw him with another woman. She\u2019d confront him, he\u2019d beat her and then hit me for telling. So, to save me and my mom from the tears, I stopped telling. Though, it was really hard for me to watch him bring other women over and be intimate with them.\n\nSix year old me would be struggling with my mathematic homework, and her boyfriend would be in the next room, strangling her until she lost consciousness. I recall her being pregnant, and him slamming and completely shattering a glass coffee table over her body. I recall her blood curdling scream as she pleaded for him to not do it. I recall peaking around the corner and seeing so much blood and thinking that my mother was dying as she quietly sobbed.\n\nMy mother kept silent about the abuse, and if I spoke to anyone in the family about it, I would be physically punished by the both of them. J even dubbed me \u201cFox News\u201d because I \u201ctalk too much\u201d.\n\nMy mother ended up dropping out from college completely due to frequent emotional breakdowns. J had an illegitimate job that did not bring in a steady income and my mom didn\u2019t work at all. We struggled, I never was the child that had what their friends had but at least we always made ends meet. J didn\u2019t have money to get me a Nintendo DS, but J could pay another woman to have sex with him. Funny how that works.\n\nOn the weekends, my little brother (the second oldest) and I would spend time with J\u2019s mother, who I called my grandmother. It was nicer and havoc free over there. We were endlessly spoiled, got frequent hugs, were emotionally tended to, and always knew that we were loved. Plus, I wouldn\u2019t have to see J, who would probably be aiming a gun at my mother\u2019s head, and threatening to kill her. My grandmother didn\u2019t have much. She lived alone in a small house and was on a fixed income. She suffered from schizophrenia and was unable to work. But, on medication, my grandmother was a stable and able woman. She chaperoned me on my elementary school\u2019s field trips to the zoo. She gave my brother and I money, even if it was a dollar, just so we could get an idea of what saving is and get used to the idea of having something valuable of our own. Those were things my mom and J failed to do. She loved listening to music, 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s classic r&amp;b/soul to be specific. It\u2019s all she ever listened to. That\u2019s what we would do together. She taught me how to tell time on a wall clock, she took pictures of me to go in the family photo album, she took me to children\u2019s parks, she spent actual time with me and I wasn\u2019t even her biological granddaughter.\n\nThere was a period where I made the mistake of telling her about our household problems and she threatened to call Child Protective Services and have me and my siblings removed from my mother\u2019s custody. I remember getting the whooping of my life when I got home, and we stayed away from Grandma\u2019s for a long while.\n\nMy mother FINALLY utilized some of her brain cells and left him when I was about nine years old. Usually, J would cheat on my mom with other women, like said. His friends, her friends, and hookers. But this time, he had a second steady girlfriend and did more for her children than he did for me and my siblings. My mom took me, my siblings, and we moved to a one bedroom apartment. She got a job at a shoe store inside of a mall to support us. She walked us to school each morning since it was right down the road. During this time, she was suffering from untreated manic depression (bipolar disorder) and since she was unhappy with her life, she had planned to kill herself. However, she didn\u2019t follow through because of me and my siblings. Helloooo, she had children to finish half-ass raising! We hardly ate anything besides boiled hot dogs and most nights we went to sleep hungry. Our apartment became bedbug infested. Hundreds were lined up in the creases of the only bed in the apartment, in the window curtains (that were actually bedsheets hung over windows), and behind the L shaped sofa. My siblings and I slept on sofa, while my mother pulled the dining table chairs together and slept on those instead. I would wake up early for school with bedbugs in the creases of my arms, and having to shake them off of my clothing.\n\nIn these moments, I had started being bullied in school for my dark skin tone that apparently made me ugly and undesirable. I had no one telling me that I was beautiful, I only heard the opposite. My mother really had no time to deal with my problems when she had bigger ones. We never had any reassuring talks or discussions, she never involved herself in my life as a loving and caring mother. I guess her only duty was to provide food and shelter and we barely had that. My siblings and I were often victims of her bipolar episodes and would have to endure her screaming and hitting. Even as a ten year old, I noticed the menacing look in her eyes during an episode. So evil and empty, she would have liked to see us drop dead. \n\nMy mother was very distant from everyone and embarrassed to let her family know that we were struggling while her older siblings were doctors and engineers. During this period I also did not see my grandmother or my real dad. And of course we never heard from J, but no one\u2019s complaining about that. She met a White guy who we\u2019ll call \u2018A\u2019 who stayed below us and began a relationship with him. He was normal and inviting in the beginning and since I didn\u2019t know any better, I was open to meeting and becoming comfortable around new people. Eventually, our living situation was ruined, the complex got shut down and everyone had to go.\n\nWe had nowhere to turn and went to a homeless shelter. It was a place that allowed you to stay for a maximum of thirty days. However, my mom and baby sister refused to eat the horrible food served. Other people staying there were rude and stuckup, so weren\u2019t even there a week. We moved to my grandmother\u2019s place, stayed there for a few weeks until J\u2019s sister, who\u2019s always hated my mother since the beginning of time, demanded that we leave.. in the middle of wintertime. \n\nSo, we went to live with J again! He had moved into a place closer to my school, with the same girlfriend and her two children who weren\u2019t even 5. They were ridiculously favored and J still acted as if he was my dad when it came to disciplining me, despite he and my mom being broken up. She didn\u2019t seem to have an issue with it, and even befriended him and his girlfriend. J and his girlfriend ended up being evicted from their home not that much later, so, we moved in with some family friends who lived on the other side of town.\n\nNow, living there was one hell of an experience. They were a couple with two young kids of their own. The guy would normally beat his girlfriend. They smoked crack together, in front of whoever. They had sex wherever and whenever, sometimes participating in threesomes. My mother had nothing to do with the drug thing or threesome thing, but she was cheating on A with a much older guy. My mom was a woman who couldn\u2019t go that long without being romantically linked to someone, and I had to find out in that way. I remember, only at ten, wondering how she could possibly cheat on someone... Her boyfriend, A, was away in a different state due to intense family problems and could not be where we were. To this day, A doesn\u2019t know that my mom cheated on him. I mean, technically, what my mother does as far as romance is none of my business but it\u2019s not the best example to set for your oldest child who looks up to no one else besides her mother. Just a thought.\n\nAnyway, the couple had rats living in the family flat. Rats, not mice. They were huge and would run across the twin sized bed that I was sharing with my sibling. We would wake up at 5 AM to get ready for school. Because my mom didn\u2019t have a car, we had to take public transportation to school. The three of us (my youngest sibling was too young for school) would huddle together at the bus stop to keep warm, and I\u2019d be sobbing because it was so cold. It was also really dark outside and looked like a ghost town, I was frightened. My tears and snot would freeze while we waited. We caught 3 different buses just to make it there on time. \n\nBy the time spring had arrived, I was eleven. A had returned and had enough money for us to rent a house out and live together. We switched schools and moved in with A. He showed his shitty true colors within time and only got worse from there. Around this time, my mom told me to stop telling her about me being bullied at school because she was tired of hearing about it. Six years, 4 school switches, my mother\u2019s alcohol addiction and a new sibling later, I made the decision to leave home because living with A and a bipolar woman who chooses when it\u2019s okay to love me became unbearable. Sure she was now on proper medication, but she was still too much. I had so much responsibility as the oldest. I could only take so fucking much. A became a guilt tripper, an emotional manipulator, a toxic, and controlling man. He was abusive towards everyone in the house. \n\nI felt like a troubled celebrity in a sense. Putting on a smile in front of distant relatives, friends, and while at school. But behind closed doors, A was choking my mother, and physically hitting everyone in the house. He was screaming at us at the top of his lungs that we were worthless and stupid and bitches. He would comment to my mom about how ugly he thought I was in the face. If he met another teenager my age who was more bubbly, cheerful and socially outgoing, he\u2019d say \u201cwhy can\u2019t you be like her?\u201d and it\u2019d hurt my feelings. Not that he cares about anyone\u2019s poor little feelings. He actually liked ruining our day and found pleasure in it. He would create problems that never existed. My heart raced whenever we were in the same room, it was that bad.\n\nAs the oldest, I took a lot of the fire, always having to defend my mother and siblings in fights. But let my mom tell it, I was moody and didn\u2019t do shit. A said once that if we ever called the police on him that he would \u2018put us in the fucking ground\u2019 and I honestly wouldn\u2019t put it past him. \n\nAfter another usual disagreement, he was threatening to beat me if I didn\u2019t do what he asked of me and I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to keep dealing with him and my mom who constantly succumbed to this psychopath. I was 17 then and my mom, told me \u201che\u2019s who I\u2019m with. If you don\u2019t like it, you can leave\u201d. So I did. To this day they are still together and want me to move back in because they need help in the household. I\u2019ve refused to do so and my mom often cries over the phone, telling me that he\u2019s gotten worse.\n\nI moved in with J in the middle of 12th grade. He was my only option at that time. My grandmother passed when I was twelve and my biological father stepped out of my life for good a year or two after that. J was still the exact same (minus having a girlfriend) and attempted to treat me the way he treated my mother. Living under his roof was cool in the beginning, but he began using me for his advantage by taking my money and treating me as his maid. He also talked to me like a child and treated me as one. A year and a half passed and he started yelling about how life was easier before I moved in, about how if I act up, he\u2019ll send me back to my mother\u2019s place, about how he technically doesn\u2019t have to do anything for me because he\u2019s not my biological father.\n\n He engaged in sex with hookers that are around my age almost every night, and it was always a new face. I never saw the same girl twice. He tried to take away my voice and I was never allowed an opinion or able to express my frustration without being threatened with physical harm. I\u2019m scared to travel alone in the dark and whenever I would tell him that an older man followed me home from school and that I felt very unsafe, which happened on a few occasions, he\u2019d laugh at it. He never took it serious enough and still sent me on walks to the store when he didn\u2019t feel like driving.\n\n The prostitues, or \u2018his friends\u2019 as he called them were usually indifferent to me. Sometimes they\u2019d immediately notice the way he treated me and confront him about it. He\u2019d brush it off. Being in college, I had a evening field trip to a theater play at a university. One of them told him that I secretly had a boyfriend and was lying about the field trip to go on a date. He believed her, and questioned me, a nineteen year old. He told me that I didn\u2019t need a boyfriend. For his information, I\u2019ve never had a boyfriend and have never engaged in any sex, drinking, smoking or drugs. Not even anything close.\n\nI grew up to be a fearful person, all thanks to them. I know what to and what not to do. I know what the consequences are. It\u2019s hard for him, my mom, and A to believe that I\u2019ve never done any of those things because in my environment, the teenagers are pregnant by the time they\u2019re eighteen years old. So, they don\u2019t believe me and it\u2019s aggravating to always be interrogated and to know that they find me untrustworthy.\n\nJ also completely says he\u2019s never hurt my mom in any way and if anyone asks why they broke up, he says it\u2019s because she wasn\u2019t performing housewife duties as a girlfriend should, so he dumped her. Which of course was a bold faced LIE. He thinks that I\u2019ve either forgotten about the domestic violence or that I was too young to understand what was going on but I haven\u2019t. I stay quiet when he tells his friends his lies and paints himself out to be a good man. \n\nIn December 2018, I had done something that ticked him off. By that point, my breathing would\u2019ve probably annoyed him but this time was different. I was feeling particularly suicidal that day and was not in the mood to deal with him that day. After I snatched something from the coffee table with an attitude, he charged at me the same way he used to charge at my mother before he\u2019d choke her out. I dodged in time and RAN into my bedroom, slamming the door shut. I shook and cried for hours because I couldn\u2019t believe... that I was actually about to be assaulted. When I came out of my room, he looked like he was sorry but he didn\u2019t say it. Too much pride? I don\u2019t know. Instead, he tried to make up for it by being nice and taking me out to eat. That same week I called my aunt and told her that I needed to leave immediately before I actually became a victim. \n\nI was unhappy with J, definitely not as unhappy as I was when I lived with my A, but still very, very unhappy. \n\nLiving with both J and then A, I\u2019ve missed countless menstrual cycles, have had my blood pressure run high due to stress dealing with bullies at school and my home life, cried myself to sleep and contemplated suicide most days. But now that we\u2019ve got the background out of the way... was that abuse? I\u2019ve separated the kinds of child abuse, because there is physical, psychological, verbal, and sexual. Plus, neglect.\n\nPHYSICAL:\nI don\u2019t think that I qualify as physically abused, but I\u2019d like to hear your opinion or view.\n- As a child, whenever I\u2019d be in trouble J would have me place my hands on a wall while he whipped me with a thick belt. Sometimes I\u2019d have to pull my pants down and stand in my underwear. I wouldn\u2019t have marks, but it\u2019d be difficult and very painful to sit down afterwards.\n- As a teenager, A would whip me with a belt but in a different manner. He\u2019d hold the buckle and fling the belt wherever he could hit, like you would with an actual whip. It didn\u2019t happen often but when it did, I\u2019d have raw red marks on my skin and black marks would be on the wall from where he hit on the times he missed.\n- As I got older, that turned into kicking and smacking across the face.\n\nPSYCHOLOGICAL:\n- On numerous occasions, my mom and A called me a stupid bitch and other names.\n- A yelled a lot over minuscule things. If you were to leave something on the ground by accident, say a towel, he\u2019d scream his head off for 30 minutes straight. Red in the face, making sure you know just how stupid you are.\n- A constantly picked on me for my weight, since I was underweight when I lived there.\n- My biological father would punish me by giving 11 year old me the silent treatment. He\u2019d have irritation and attitude in his voice and face, saying that he wished that I was born a boy instead. Whenever we\u2019d go to a place, I\u2019d usually tag along inside of the store. But when it was a bad day and he was upset with me, he\u2019d force me to stay in the car while he and my cousin (also my age) would go shopping and not buy me anything. As his only child, I wasn\u2019t used to being pushed aside and disregarded like this. He would play mind games and create problems out of thin air like A does but he\u2019s more delusional. A is probably just trying to ruin your day because he\u2019s having a bad day himself, meanwhile my biological dad has delusional thoughts and thinks that I\u2019ve done something against him. I would never know why he was upset at me and he would never tell me He\u2019d cold flip into a different person in a matter of seconds. I was an honor roll student and a shy, mild-mannered child who stayed out of trouble, so I really had no idea what I was doing wrong.\n\nSEXUAL:\n*TRIGGER* \nThe most painful for me to talk about. The memories that I\u2019ve repressed for years. I don\u2019t have nightmares about these experiences because I\u2019ve literally THREW them to the back of my mind and refused to deal with it. Whenever I do find the right guy, this is really gonna\u2019 come back to haunt me.\n- Starting when I was around six, my grandmother\u2019s younger boyfriend, who was around mid-40s, would regularly molest me on the weekends. He\u2019d wait until late night, force me to watch pornographic movies, perform oral sex on me, and make me perform oral sex on him. I didn\u2019t like it, and knew it was wrong. On weekdays I\u2019d deal with J and my mom fighting and on weekends, I\u2019d deal with being sexually molested. I told my mom, we went to court and everything but as I was young, I had a hard time accurately describing what happened to me in detail. There were so many occasions where he had done this, I didn\u2019t know which one to talk about. I didn\u2019t like how everyone I knew was in the courtroom watching me. There were no witnesses and so the case was dropped. I vowed to never put myself through that type of humiliation and embarrassment ever again. The man continued to hurt me until I was eleven.\n- When I was around ten, my biological father forced me to help him masturbate. Directly after the event, he apologized but I don\u2019t think that I can accept his apology. If we ever cross paths again, I will never be comfortable around him.\n- As I got older, about two other men would touch and grope me inappropriately. One was a neighbor, and another was a cousin.\n\nVERBAL:\n- In one of her episodes my mom would tell me that she doesn\u2019t see me going to college or having a full filled life. She says I\u2019ll be right back at her porch, begging to come home after getting a taste of the real world. Because I couldn\u2019t wait to be 18 and move out and would often say it, she\u2019d say \u201cyou\u2019re trying to grow up too fast\u201d. No, Mom, I\u2019m trying to escape this shithole as soon as I\u2019m old enough to do so.\n- A often ordered and demanded me around, everyone in the house. He hardly lifted a finger to do anything.\n- He as well as my mom and J undermined my feelings, and passed me off as being a moody girl with a bad attitude problem whose never happy.\n- Being around my mom is constantly like walking on eggshells. In a disagreement or argument that concerns me, she tells me that i\u2019m being just like my father and how I hate her. Sure, she pisses me off but HATE you? I\u2019ve done nothing my entire life besides trying my hardest to love her and to be loved, so that hurts a lot when she screams that I hate her or want her dead. It almost makes me want to cry now just thinking about it.\nThere are other occurrences as well, but 3 bullet points are enough.\n\nNEGLECT:\n- I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been purposely neglected? Not sure. If I never had school supplies, winter boots, or a coat, it was because of financial instability. But A and my mom also smoked through several packs of cigarettes and a lot of weed every week. They absolutely cannot go without weed but I can go without pads for when I\u2019m on my cycle, right?\n- I had interests in singing and acting as a pre-teen and whenever I\u2019d bring up wanting to join a drama club or express that I would like to sing, she\u2019d give me this look. And the look is hard to describe, it\u2019s like she\u2019d be half-listening and not taking me serious at all. Instead of saying that she thinks I could sing or join a drama club, she\u2019d change the subject by talking about something related to the subject. I felt as if she wasn\u2019t supportive enough.\n- When I expressed frustrations, my mom would say \u201ci had to go through it too\u201d and bring up her own experience. She never did it with the intentions of trying to console me and showing me that she relates it was more like saying, \u2018suck it up, if I had go through it, then so do you.\u2019\n\nThe only one who showed up to my high school graduation was J. A was mad at me for saying that I didn\u2019t want to move back in so he didn\u2019t attend but he wasn\u2019t going to attend anyway. My mom was there but had more important things to do like smoke a cigarette outside. So she missed me walk across the stage, didn\u2019t get a picture and didn\u2019t bother apologizing. And my biological father, no one was even expecting him to do anything, he doesn\u2019t even call on my birthday. \n\nI\u2019ll be twenty this spring. Last month, I moved in with my mom\u2019s older sister. Living here, I don\u2019t have to be threatened, or hit, smacked, kicked, humiliated, berated or treated like a child. I don\u2019t have to witness it either. I won\u2019t be screamed at for fixing myself something to eat. If I\u2019m sad, or angry, or frustrated, I can show it. My aunt expresses how sorry she is that I had to go through such a bad time. She tells me that my childhood wasn\u2019t normal and that I might need therapy. \n\nI haven\u2019t lived with my mom since 2016 and I still have intense nightmares of being at her house and A badly harming her. Whenever I try to intervene, she gets mad at ME for doing anything.\n\nAs for what how I deal outside of those nightmares, I\u2019m depressed and highly socially anxious. It seems to get worse year by year. I\u2019m shy, guarded, observant, worrisome, a people pleaser. I steer clear away from all men not that they talk to me anyway, and the thought of being sexual with a man makes me nauseous and anxious. I can\u2019t imagine why anyone would ever love me or like what they see. I feel as though I shouldn\u2019t be alive. I have urges to involve myself in drug use but care too much about my future. I can\u2019t walk into a public place without thinking and believing that everyone in the room is talking and whispering bad things about me. They are delusional thoughts and no one is able to convince me otherwise. Last week, I walked out of lecture and went home in tears because I swore up and down that the entire class was making fun of me... I want to tell myself that they weren\u2019t, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to believe myself.\n\nI\u2019ve lost interest in things that once made me happy, like writing. I feel hopeless, worthless, I socially isolate myself. I repeatedly go over thoughts and think of ways I could kill myself. I have highs and lows. There are days where I feel happy and okay with life and I think that I\u2019m okay. Then it comes crashing down a day or two later, I wake up and the first thing I do is cry for an unknown reason. In those dark days, I feel like I\u2019ve dissociated and lost myself, I feel like here but mentally, I\u2019m not all the way here. \n\nI actually live with someone who used to inappropriately touch me when I was younger (the cousin I mentioned) and now even though he doesn\u2019t do it anymore I\u2019m extremely jumpy and worrisome around him. I wake up with ...hallucinations(?)and feel a hand on my butt, causing me to panic on the inside and jerk completely awake. Not sure what it\u2019s called since I\u2019m FEELING a hand instead of SEEING. The touch feels so realistic and disturbing, I don\u2019t know what to do about that.\n\nAnyway, thank you for taking your time out and reading my entire childhood story. I appreciate you. But I have to ask: were the things I went through bad or am I just being dramatic like my mom probably thinks? I mean, lots of other people have had it way worse, I\u2019m sure... please, what do you think?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I\u2019ve been with them 10 years now.. and I guess I want to find out if maybe she might be a narc..\n\nThe first 3 years were a blur, I felt really happy. Everything seemed great..\n\nIn 2011, I found out she was cheating online with a guy, I was away for work starting a new career, a 6 month training , and she blamed me for leaving her alone, that she didn\u2019t really care for the guy and was just lonely.. she said she would stop talking to him but kept doing it, I said I was legitimately done and she begged me so hard she wouldn\u2019t do it again.. I broke down and stayed and I thought everything would be okay..\n\n2015, same thing happened. We are were married now, had a home, I came home one day from work and she said she wanted a divorce , she was talking to a new guy online.. I had to go to the guest bed room and could hear them talking on skype every night for about 2 weeks.. I don\u2019t know why but this time I begged her to try and give us a new shot , to work through issues.. the guy got uninterested in her and got a gf in real life , and she decided that she wanted to try again.. I did 12 solo therapy and a few couples, she did 4 therapy sessions and said the therapist wanted her to see a phychiatrist.. she never ended up going. \n\nDuring that time I found a journal hidden under the bed when I was cleaning, trying to distract myself.. the journal only had one entry and seemed first person, but maybe fantasy.  It said something like \u201cI am a vampire. I feed off emotion and love of others, I don\u2019t actually feel anything for them, they feed me with their love and devotion, then I discard them like they are nothing. Except for my light ( she always used to call me her light ), but I have problems and hate myself for everything I\u2019ve done to hurt him.\u201d I kinda just blew this off, she\u2019s a creative writing major, idk maybe it was nothing.\n\n2016, 2 days before Christmas vacation I had planned for months, I had a week off.. we were talking while i was at work and agreed to buy a cruise.. I bought the cruise and she came down and brought me lunch and said hello.. said she would see me at night. I come home and she is gone, she says she\u2019s going to her aunts when I call and I beg her to turn around.. she says she wants to and should but doesn\u2019t.. the next day I found out she drove 9 hours to have sex with s guy she met on the internet, she stayed with him for 2 weeks, but he had no job, lived with his mom, etc.\n\nWhen she came back, we didn\u2019t talk at first. She said she was getting the papers.. eventually she started saying things like she felt crazy, out of her mind, her new birth control made her feel even worse and reckless, she felt brain washed by the guy and manipulated. I woke up one morning to meet a lawyer , and she text and called me 50x begging me not to and saying she would drag the divorce as long as possible , begging my to try to work on things. I don\u2019t know why I stayed.. a month later I found out she texted him again, and she threatened to kill herself with scissors and put them to her wrist , said she only contacted him to tell him how much she hated him.. I didn\u2019t really buy it..\n\nNow, 8 days ago she asked for a divorce, said she is unhappy , lives with too much guilt from what she has done to our relationship. Asked me cuddle 5 days ago, I end up taking her to a movie after ... 3 days ago she asked again and I ended up taking her on a mountain trip after .. \n\nLast night I asked for some info to fill out the papers , she gave it to me , then started texting me stuff. I ignored it, she came and talked to me and said she was unhappy and didn\u2019t feel like we could work on things. I said ok. She asked if the dogs could visit each other when we divorce and I said no, I didn\u2019t want to see or talk to her again when this is over, we wouldn\u2019t be friends.. I was done with the paper work and going to submit it soon, that I felt okay divorcing . she got mad and went to the other bedroom.\n\nThen she started texting me saying she was sorry, she almost felt like she could try to work on things with me , apologized for tearing up our relationship again, causing stress , being a bad wife, etc.. she begged me to come sleep with her, I ignored her for a 5-6 texts but finally broke.. we cuddled and ended up having sex all night..\n\nToday we texted some and she said \u201cwe are gonna be the fucked up couple that still has sex all the time when they get divorced..we just talked about random stuff avoiding the issues after that ..\n\n\nI understand that I might be super fucked up, super weak, acting like a chump, acting stupid.. I know that. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard for me to walk away from her.. I feel like I know I should, but it\u2019s so hard and easy when she gives me love/ attention.  could she be a narc ? I just don\u2019t know.. I think maybe..  I tried to summarize everything  and put a time line.. I\u2019m obviously not perfect and I\u2019ll take blame for whatever .. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This messaging has been going on for a few days on fb and I'm not sure if I should reply and tell him I'm too busy to help him or block him again (he will most likely make another account) or should I deactivate my Facebook account for a while or should I just delete it and backup my stuff as I'm trying to make my life more private lately but I want to keep in contact with some friends and family. Anyway I'm fairly shaken up by this aswell but haven't mentioned it to my current boyfriend thats really sweet and smart and overall a good person (honestly I should just ask him but I'm just nervous that he might get jealous or something ) I'm worried enough that my ex may see this post somehow even though its unlikely but I feel like they may have planned out that I will post this idk they were very manipulative and even made me feel at fault for literally everything. \n\n\n\n\n\ntl:dr abusive ex messaging me on Facebook, not sure what action I should take.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I don't know whether she was a perpetrator or mostly a victim herself. Bad family boundaries were likely a factor.\n\nI was given a couple of phone numbers for organisations that could help. I got an email after speaking on the phone with more phone numbers for other organisations, saying such discussions are basically not what they deal with.\n\nSo my psychiatrist called to say he contacted the safeguarding team and they say he needs to contact child social services who may need to contact the police. I imagine the worry is that they are a single parent, who lives with our parents. I am somewhat concerned about this because I'm no expert in the associated risks, but I'm scared of my niece being with the other parent more than with them. But maybe gaslighting has just gotten to me too much.\n\nI brought up the abuse a year ago. He decides to contact them two weeks ago when I ask for support. What I'll get is an interrogation I'm not prepared for. My psychiatrist also treats this sibling and one of our parents. When I asked again as I do every time if it was appropriate for him to be treating me he didn't ignore me like before and said I could make such an enquiry with the clinic if I wanted to. I told him I was asking him, he said he'll pass my question along.\n\nI wanted to define the experience before involving anyone like social services. If it's just a fucked up mess that everyone is healing from then my family is about to be torn apart again and all the reasons I've been trying to address this so carefully have me scared for my family, despite the anger I still have.\n\nI was hoping an expert would either confirm I experienced abuse and help me take appropriate steps to fix things, or explain that the age gap suggests that this isn't so serious and things can be more easily healed. I don't want to prosecute, and I don't know if I even could.\n\nMy Dad won't take this stress. Vascular dementia. He was just starting to get better. My Mother is gonna be destroyed. She won't know how to handle it, she'll want to protect us both whilst denying she could've done anything better.\n\nI wanted an apology and to move on, I was hoping that maybe the psychiatrist could facilitate that in time. I got an apology but it wasn't honest. It was amongst gaslighting that we were actually younger (I think to preserve innocence?) When I said to my mother that I'm sure it had fucked me up she said \"But you were so young when it happened\". So conversations were obviously had. I had spoken to my sibling directly before anyone else in the family. They've been breaking down since. They need therapy, which they are trying to access again of their own volition.\n\nI don't know what to believe anymore. I needed clarification. Now I'll only get it with it being out of my control. How am I supposed to trust these people?\n\nI told my psychiatrist all my fears and how I wanted to approach this. He went and spoke to a board without asking me and now he's being told he's obligated to report. After a year of knowing. I said in a meeting with this psyche, ADHD psyche and my psychotherapist that I didn't know if I needed to report it, but I imagined if they were a risk to their daughter then one of them would've surely done something by now. I never expected this to happen after this amount of time.\n\nI just wanna fucking kill myself to get out. Thank fuck I have my girlfriend. I'm terrified of police being involved. They're corrupt as hell and helped our neighbors to harass us for years because our neighbor was mayor. We just came from a bad neighbor situation and I don't think my parents handled it well either; too raw from the past.\n\nI wish I'd never mentioned it. I'm not ready. They still won't give me the only medication that ever worked for me because it was off-label and these guys don't want to accept liability for if it goes wrong. If he'd bothered to check some.things with me first, he would know I just got signed off from therapy for in April and have no session this week.\n\nI was already not sleeping. Fuck I don't know what to do. Everything I'm terrified of might happen and short of faking total insanity I don't know how to feel in control again. I think I preferred carrying this weight myself and checking in on my niece to make sure she's safe. It's those checks that have me almost certain enough that she won't get fucked up, at least not through physical or sexual abuse.\n\nFor a while I thought I was more of a risk, but therapy cleared that up for me and I'm over the fear that I may pass on trauma.\n\nThis is the worst timing. I can't undo this. I hate this. I just want it all to stop.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

However, sometimes I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just flaws my boyfriend presents. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years and it\u2019s serious. However, I am just picking up on the red flags that flew earlier in our relationship. \n\nWhen we first started dating, everything was super fun and I loved him so much. \nThen one day he kept pushing that I cut off all my friends because they weren\u2019t good for me, whereas he is. Reluctantly, I did it. He ended up being the only person I saw, except for my family. \n\nBut I was happy, I loved seeing him, I enjoyed being in his presence. I couldn\u2019t complain. \n\nHe started pushing that I see my family less (I live with my parents while I finish up college) and that I don\u2019t need to be home as often since I\u2019m an adult. I tried arguing that it\u2019s disrespectful to my parents if I were to pretty much abandon them and only be home when it\u2019s beneficial to me. He couldn\u2019t understand that. \n\nI was working a shitty food service job, as everyone does. And nobodies coworkers are perfect, but he urged that I quit because my previous coworker had a crush on me. I was quitting anyway, as I had a great job opportunity coming up. But he turned the situation as his idea for me to quit. \n\nThis was all within the first four months of our relationship. \n\nHe would get really weird whenever I had ANY sort of interaction with a male. One time I accidentally walked in front of an old man and said \u2018sorry, sir\u2019 and he told me it was inappropriate because that man probably thought sexually of me. \n\nFinally, I had gotten used to his little quirks (as I had viewed them). But just in the past 6 months, I had found out that he had been sneaking around and talking to other girls. He acted all offended that I had questioned his faithfulness and that I should be sorry for hurting him like that and accusing him.  Lying through his teeth, he practically told me I am wrong for believing my own two eyes. \n\nJust recently told him that I don\u2019t love him like I used to, gave all these examples I have listed above. He told me that I am overthinking and our relationship is great. Now he\u2019s been acting loving and nice. Has he changed? Is he a narc? He is very convincing when I want to breakup, telling me that things will get better. \n\nI\u2019ve posted in relationship advice  regarding what I should do. As the answer is obvious to breakup with him. I want to hear from those who experienced a relationship with a narcissist, do these signs add up to being a narc? ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

And with most of the letters that I wrote for you, I\u2019ve torn up and you\u2019ll never read them. But with this one, I get a feeling you\u2019ll be seeing it. I think I need to start off my saying-You\u2019re a horrible person. No amount of money, surgery for your looks, or new boytoys will ever change that. You\u2019re an ugly person. Your insides must be rotting. And I hope you rot in hell for the things that you\u2019ve done to this family for your own benefit. I\u2019ll introduce you to Satan myself. I can\u2019t help but be angry at how you are leaving my family. Maybe I just feel this way because the wounds are still fresh and raw. It doesn\u2019t matter what I tell you in this letter because no matter what you\u2019ll deny it all for the sake of keeping your perfect image. We\u2019ll get to the damage you\u2019ve done to me last. You've broken my dad. You've torn him to pieces making sure he has no sense of free will or pride or even hope left. You've made so many empty threats. You've physically abused him- yes mom throwing objects at his head and hitting him is abuse. And you would send him to jail if he did the same to you. Don't even try to argue because I already know your response... \"I didn't do that you're imagining things. You're lying for attention.\" I'm tired of those manipulative words. Last night he didn't sleep because this reality is really setting in for him. He has been in denial about the way you are for so so long. I can't imagine the pain he feels right now. You promised to love him. You promised to him, to this \"God\" that you swear you believe in, in front of your family. You walked out of the door this morning telling him that you've \"had enough\" that he \"let himself go\" and he asked to take you to dinner tonight to talk and you told him \"the time for talking is over.\" Which is so very interesting considering that he was there for you at your heaviest and worst. You might have lost all of the weight but you never lost the nastiness and bitterness that came with that. He has tried to talk to you so many times. Offered therapy, offered church sessions, offered to go to dinner for your own talks. And you claim that he doesn't care. It's sad how much he loves such a bitter woman. He follows you around like a sad beaten puppy. You say he has done nothing for you. He bought your car. He paid for your weight loss surgery and the program that came with that. He paid for your fake boobs. He paid for your skin surgery. He bought diamond rings and bracelets only for you to throw them and try to trash them. Devices only for you to chuck them at his head. Now, what really breaks him. You cheat. You've done it so many times. When you used to leave the house at 9 pm because you were mad and not coming home until 3 am. Do you know how much it hurt me to find out you were with other men during those times? I stayed up, 8 years old, waiting for you to come home, worried and afraid. The time I found those messages on your phone. You tried to push me to the ground when I threatened to tell Dad. You couldn't because you were too small. He refused to look at the messages swearing he \"trusted\" you. But this new guy. Who you swore you were \"just friends\" with. Mom. He's half your age. You could be his mom. What are you doing? Why would you choose him? He doesn't want a real relationship with you. He lives in his parent's basement. Yet you still pull my dad down and compare my dad to this 20-year-old child. He comes to the house and eats our food and spends 4x the amount of time with you then you do with us. He stays at our house past 1 am. If Dad did that with another girl you would be furious. Were you only with my dad for money? Or at some point did you actually love him? I like to think you loved him. When did that stop? When did you decide you were too good for this man who has devoted so many years to you? You know what you\u2019ve done. You know you broke him. And you don\u2019t care. All you can ever see is yourself. My sisters are afraid of you. They fear you physically and emotionally. They don\u2019t want to be around you. You\u2019ve left them scarred and they\u2019re not even that old. You told my baby sister \u201cif you don't stop crying I\u2019m going to beat the fucking shit out of you.\u201d She was only crying because you were yelling at her. Now me. The things you have said are forever left on in my thoughts. I hear those words echo in my head at night. Whore. Slut. No wonder people don\u2019t want to be your friend. Fat. Pig. Selfish. Attention seeking. I know you\u2019ll deny it. But it is impossible to get those words out of my head, out of my brain late at night. You shamed me when I told you I was being molested by your father. You still call it a misunderstanding. You say he was only being a loving grandfather. Mom he molested me. You were my mom. You were supposed to protect me. But you protected him and shamed me. It doesn\u2019t matter if you love him. It doesn\u2019t matter if he is your dad. I was uncomfortable. I was scared. I was so young. But all you had to say is \u201cyou\u2019re doing this for attention.\u201d When I started to learn to love my body you only tried to pull me down. One day I touched my stomach and said: \u201cI love my tummy.\u201d You scolded me and told me \u201cwhen you say that it hurts MY feelings.\u201d My self-love hurts YOUR feelings. When I bought something I really liked this summer you said I didn't look good. You said you could tell I have a stomach and that I should return it. I loved how it looked. Needless to say this time I kept it. I kept it because I liked it and I was wearing it. Not you. When I used to hear your car pull up I would panic. In middle school when the bus drove by our house on the way home, if I saw your car I became scared. I used to not be able to sleep at night because you would randomly storm into my room and demand my phone and my stuff at 1 am. I didn\u2019t sleep for 3 days straight once because you told me \u201chow would you feel if I came into your room at night while you sleep and killed you.\u201d When I confronted you about it you told me \u201cit was just a joke you take things so seriously.\u201d Since 3rd grade, I have hated my body because you told me I should. I shouldn\u2019t be concerned about that in 3rd grade. Every time I did something you didn\u2019t like you told me I only cared about myself. When you would get mad you would throw plates. You would slam doors. You would scream curse words upon curse words at me, a small child. And now you take it as an \u201caccomplishment\u201d that you don't curse at as \u201cas much.\u201d Child services have had to get involved because of you. Yet that wasn't a sign for you to stop being the way you are. You use my mental health as a pity card to pull for other people\u2019s attention. Every time I have emotions, happy, sad, frustrated, angry, etc etc. You like to pull out your cards. I laugh and you say I'm manic. If I feel sad you say I'm depressed. You even explained your father molesting me by saying \u201cyou must have imagined it. Maybe you have schizophrenia.\u201d Do you know how much that hurt? You withhold love and affection as a punishment. I can\u2019t come to you. I can\u2019t trust you. I want to have my mom. I want a relationship with you. I\u2019ve tried so hard. But you no longer care. You don't love me anymore. If you ever did I never felt it. Even when I tell you \u201c I love you,\u201d you say \u201cno\u201d or \u201cleave me alone\u201d or \u201cnot right now.\u201d So I\u2019ve given up. I want to say I\u2019m not angry. I want to say that I forgive you. I want to say I love you. But i want to be so far away from you. I want nothing more than for you to get it together and for you to want to have a relationship with me. But in reality i know you won\u2019t. I know you will deny every single word in this letter. I know you\u2019ll hate me. I know you will say this is for attention. So do me a favor and don\u2019t say it. Because i know what you\u2019ll have to say. I wish i had a mother in my life. But i have you. Someone who has given me trust issues. Someone who has left me in distress. I\u2019m working on it. I\u2019m working on not expecting you to change. I\u2019m working on expecting the least from you. I'm working on not being bitter. I still want you. I still want a relationship. But I'm working on letting that go. I hope you someday will work on yourself too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

We don't want to get back into a relationship, or at least that's what she says, we were just talking and solving things a bit between the two of us, and honestly, it worked out. We had fun, and we took breaks on a regular basis. We also sounded like we understood eachother a lot better. \n\nMaybe that's what they call hoovering, even though she already 'final' discarded me a few weeks ago. Either way, it went well, until today. She said she wasn't feeling well, and that it felt wrong talking to me. I tried to comfort her, saying that it'd pass, that I'm here for her, and that she can take some time away from me if she wanted. Suddenly, she said I told her I didn't need her. I replied, saying I never said that. At least I don't remember, and I don't think I'd ever say that to her. Then she said our 'friendship' wasn't gonna last, so I said it hurt me to live in constant fear for her discarding me.\n\nIt was from that moment that things started to get nasty. She said, I'll copy the message,\n'Excuse me, but as of now I don\u2019t have to take your needs into consideration anymore. We\u2019re not a couple, my every move doesn\u2019t have to fit your wants and needs now. I can only do what's best for me'. \n\nThat really hurt me. I kinda understand what she meant, but at that moment, it came across as 'I don't care about your wishes', and maybe that's what it actually meant, I genuinely don't know anymore.\n\nThings were still okay at that point, 'till she suddenly decided to lash out at me. Out of nowhere, she said I hurt her with what I said earlier when I was hurt. I said sorry, and that I didn't mean to sound disrespectful if I did (even though I have no idea what she was on about), and that if I said something wrong, that it was because I was hurt. Then she said this, I copy:\n\n'If you can\u2019t control what you said, I\u2019m expected to forgive and let it go. God forbid I don\u2019t.

Who do you think you\u2019re talking to?'\n\nBelieve me when I say I don't know what she's on about. When I asked her to give an example of what I said, she just said 'I don't have to point out everything you do wrong, read back and ask yourself what you did wrong'. Is it just me, or does she not know what she's blaming me for? Because I really don't have a clue. \n\nContinuing that matter, she suddenly said I always kept bothering her by asking to get back together. Like, sorry? We talked about that two days ago, and cleared things up, saying we're not getting back together. I literally don't know what she meant, and I'm 100% sure I didn't even IMPLY anything like that. \n\nIn the end, I ended up apologising for something I have no idea of, and the last thing she said was, I copy:\n\n'It's not like I ever forgave you really\nI'll just go jump off a bridge for being fucking stupid'\n\nAfter sending that, she left, and she's giving me the silent treatment now, leaving me worried, feeling both confused and guilty for something I can't recall doing (???) \n\nI don't know if this is a clear narc sign or not, I'm still not 100% sure if she's a narc or not, but holy * I need advice on how to deal with this, some form of support, anything, without blocking her, I do want to talk with her. \n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

His new gf broke up with him about two months ago and he tried to contact me through multiple channels several times. I got a restraining order against him. I have also avoided most social media and that has been incredibly helpful. However, today I checked his twitter and I did a deep dive. He has been trying so many techniques to get me back. At first, he was blaming me for everything that has happened, saying I'm awful and lying and trying to ruin his life. He said I was abusive. Then a couple of weeks after that he started saying how much he misses me. Then this past week he has been posting mementos from our hiking trips together. I am really angry at him for even daring to blame me for what has happened, his victim blaming, and his projecting. But I also know that people on this subreddit will understand me when I say that I miss him dearly. I know I will not respond to him or talk to him or make any contact whatsoever but I sure as hell miss him. What he did to me is unforgivable and I have more self esteem now to not deal with his bullshit but I would be lying if I said I didn't still love him and I doubt I will ever stop. I'm sure I'll love someone else again, even more than I love him, but it hurts me that the relationship is just unfixable because of him. Looking for words of support and strength.

I spend most of my life either with my fiance or by myself in my apartment. I have no support due to being from a completely different area and culture than the one I am in now. I struggle with living in the city and often feel overwhelmed. I have no contact with my family or old friends who have moved on with their lives without me since I ran away. I also am no longer the same person I used to be as I have adapted in some ways to the culture I am now surrounded by, leaving myself in a weird in between where I am not accepted completely by either culture and generally struggle to fit in. I've recently entered into college further complicating things as the college I am attending is integrated into the city, making it to where most students do not see each other multiple times a week. This makes it hard to form friendships. Due to my old culture being heavily demonized where I am now I often feel like an ideological outcast who constantly has to check their words. Even worse, people are often demonized and publicly humiliated for having the more conservative beliefs that I share. Even my room mate (who isn't my fiance) has a very intense hatred for most of my views which makes it hard to talk about anything even remotely related to anything they consider political. I often feel trapped and alone because I was forced out of my home into this situation due to parental abuse that put my life at risk, which I still struggle with.\n\nNow after 2 years of therapy and trying to get my shit in line I still feel empty and like I am out of place.

She gave 3500 to the trashy friend of hers that helped her pull it off, and spent the rest on drugs, parties, and ditching her 3rd kids dad to move back to our hometown w the baby she essentially ran off with, having never informed her ex she was leaving.

Not exaggerated. At all.\n\nMy dad works away during the week - he always has, so we only see him on weekends, and because he\u2019s not used to our \u2018chaotic home\u2019 (not quoting anyone, but there\u2019s always something we can do to improve it i.e. spending the weekend cleaning, organising stuff, the norm) he gets stressed when he comes home. Especially when it\u2019s particularly messy. I live with my stay-at-home mum and four sisters so he\u2019s outnumbered to be fair. \n\nBecause of that, he can get angry. He\u2019s rarely angry, but when he is, it\u2019s fucking scary. Like, Jesus. He doesn\u2019t usually get enraged when my mum\u2019s home but it gets bad on the weekends that she goes away, most commonly when she needs to leave for dental procedures, it just gets too much for him and he gets really angry. This is almost every time she leaves the house. Which again, is rare, but it happens. \n\nMost recently I can remember my dad standing at the bottom of the stairs yelling his voice raw for my 11 year old little sister to come back downstairs (which she didn\u2019t do, he\u2019s obviously going to grab her and hit her or just grab her and yell in her face - he has a track record of that), so he got mad as shit and ran upstairs and stood outside her door yelling that he was going to kick it down. Now, when I\u2019ve told people about this I\u2019ve always told them that he actually did kick it down and proceeded to hit her when he got inside (because I\u2019m a disgusting, lying little shit) but I don\u2019t actually know if he did. I do have an [audio recording](https://youtu.be/PZqqgow213M) of him standing outside of my little sister\u2019s door (two corridors and a small staircase away) yelling at her about it, and you can hear repeated kind of odd snap noises I guess? I don\u2019t know if that was him hitting the door to further intimidate her or him genuinely kicking the door but it was scary as shit either way which is why I didn\u2019t get involved. Maybe I\u2019m just a scaredy-cat, I don\u2019t know. He came back half an hour later to call her selfish for crying, too, because of \u2018everything he gets for us\u2019. Gee, thanks dad. She\u2019s 12.\n\nThe other time, my other little sister was being a smart-mouth and he decided to chase her down in the garden (this was ages ago), and when he finally couldn\u2019t keep up with her, he came back home and laughed because my little sister was crying and she \u2018wasn\u2019t even the one in trouble\u2019, and then just moved on.\n\nThose are the two worst ones I can recall from 2018. Probably some of the only ones too.\n\nThere were a few incidents in the other houses we\u2019ve lived in (18 houses for me I think? Well over 40 for my older sisters, it\u2019s insane) but I can\u2019t remember them very well. I remember my dad getting angry at me about something and me just up and leaving the townhouse we were in in the middle of the night, until my friend who was texting me at the time convinced me to come home. I might\u2019ve just been being a drama queen, *who knows*.\n\nMost recent one was when I was up at 3am playing guitar (quietly) and he got very angry at this and raised his voice at me in the middle of the night. I guess I woke him up. It wasn\u2019t that loud but he put on that oh-shit-gonna-get-hit voice of his that made me instantly shut up at cry myself to sleep until 4 because it\u2019s not violent but the history it\u2019s associated with is scary. It\u2019s the same voice he puts on every time he\u2019s hit us in the past. Which again, isn\u2019t often, *BUT LOUD VOICES SCARE THE SHIT OUT OF ME NOW*.\n\nI texted him about controlling his temper, and he forwarded that to my mum, and she answered him saying that \u2018they don\u2019t have a brother, so they don\u2019t understand how angry a man can get\u2019 because she had a severely physically abusive brother when she was young and said the same thing to me, essentially discrediting everything I\u2019m upset about, and we moved on. My dad has since been messaging me defending his side of the story. She told him that he gets no angrier than any other father does.\n\nOh also the most memorable part of that 3am thing was that he came in, made a face and went \u2018Willow, this is *sick*\u2019 and *then* got angry. That really hit me hard.\n\nAnyway, everyone online says that he\u2019s an abusive dad, but is he? If it\u2019s that rare, is he really? He\u2019s not abusive to my mum, if anyone it\u2019s me and my sisters. I don\u2019t know anymore. I don\u2019t believe the people online because of my mum\u2019s opinion, but I don\u2019t believe my mum\u2019s opinion because of the people online.\n\nHelp.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that he\u2019s found a way to monitor and limit everything on my phone depending on how he feels, and sort of has a history of alcoholism. He was an alcoholic but not a violent one. And my phone is entirely monitored aside from Reddit and Discord. Also used to be limited to 10pm but I changed that on my mum\u2019s iPad so that I\u2019m not locked out at 10pm anymore.\n\nThis entire post is probably really pathetic because I\u2019m probably just a whiny teenager. Sorry in advance.\n\nHoo, there\u2019s a lot to say. He\u2019s threatened to give my puppy a hiding if I don\u2019t train her properly before too, which er, no, fuck off, and the smell of wine always reminds me of my dad\u2019s breath which is weird. We grew up with him always drinking red wine when he got home. Not really a bad thing, though. He\u2019s called me names before and often brings up the fact that he gets us shit (my PS3, PC etc.) as a guilt trip but whatever. It\u2019s been pretty bad since day one but still, not that bad? Like, it could be a shit ton worse and although it\u2019s distanced me from my dad I don\u2019t think his behaviour is particularly abnormal or abusive.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

My dad was already having his doubts about the marriage but coming from a broken home himself, wanted to stick with it. From the very beginning my mother was very controlling and protective of me. From what I ate, to what I wore, to who got to hold me, to ho got to be near me. Everything had to be just so and no one cold tell her otherwise. My dad had little to no say. She constantly took pictures of me and filmed me. I was always dressed up fancy from the day I was born and this would continue on for years. According to my grandmother, I was not allowed to even have mashed potatoes until I was 2, that is unless she gave them to me behind my mother's back. When I was only 6 moths, my mom had my ears pierced. My grandmother was there and said I screamed for about an hour. My first word was \"mommy\". Dad worked all the time, he drove trucks and could be gone for days on end. My mother was my world. They fought all the time and mom made me take her side. She made sure I played in a way she liked. I had dolls, and tea sets, only quiet toys that did not make noises. If my dad gave me a toy truck, or if I wanted to play with my cousin's toy tractors, mom would swiftly come in and tell me not to play with the boyish toys, even if I was trying to make Barbie drive the tractor. As a toddler and small child, my mom dressed me in poofy dresses that had to have 2 petty coats underneath, and stalkings, and buckled shoes. She curled my hair every day. On some occasions she even put make-up on me. I looked like a doll. I looked like a grown woman sometimes. Everyone would say \"Oh what a pretty girl, you're such a good mother.\" and she'd bask in the glory. She taught me to not talk to strangers. Strangers were anyone she had not given me permission to talk to, even people we went to church with, even family members. She told me that I did not have to listen to any adult but her. When I started school, that caused problems. I have a hard time for other reasons. I was often late to class because she took so long getting me ready. I couldn't play in my nice dresses. I wasn't used to being around so many other children. If I misbehaved in public, sh'd take me to the bathroom and spank me with a wooden cooking spoon. If I refused to go quietly when she said \"Come with me, I have a surprise for you.\" she'd hit me twice as many times. If I misbehaved in school, she'd spank me and also make me sit on the fireplace and not move for 5 minutes. If I so much as coughed, it started over.  I began playing sports. Mom came to all my practices and inserted herself in the circle of moms. She always had a bottle of \"mommy juice\" with her. I accidentally took a sip one day and spit it out. The moms asked her to not come anymore. I wasn't allowed to go if she couldn't, so I didn't get to do sports anymore. Some times, usually 2-3 times a week, we'd go to the neck county to buy \"mommy-juice\", right after she picked me up from school. Because it was so far, I had to do my homework in the car. She bought a horse. She bought a horse and we did not have anywhere to keep it. My dad had some friends who had property, and she had to pay rent to them to keep her freeking horse there, but she also had to care for it herself. So everyday we went there too, and stayed for hours, sometimes all day. She wouldn't feed me on those days. If I didn't pack a lunch, I wouldn't eat until we got home that night. I became more like a servant to her, mixing her drinks and making her food, doing her laundry and cleaning her bathroom. Dad was called off to go fight in Iraq. We ran out of food. We had money, she just didn't want to go shopping. She made up a new rule to keep me from misbehaving in school. She'd spank me before going, 5 times, and if I moved it started over. If I did misbehave, she'd hit me 10 times, and I'd get 10 the next morning. Sometimes she'd throw in a \"one to grow on\" for fun. She found out she was pregnant. She miscarried. According to my other grandma, she'd overdosed on drugs. She had to sell her horse when dad came home on medical leave. He found out about the morning spankings and told her to stop.  Dad had to have surgery, and went back to the war. She went back to the parties and bringing home strange men and drinking. Once summer, she had my older cousin come stay with us so she could go party and my cousin would stay home with me. There was little food and mom would hardly buy me cloths anymore. She no longer took pictures of me. She still picked out my cloths and told me who I could and couldn't talk to. She began to inspect me. To make sure I was \"developing\" as I should. When dad came home for good, it was found out she'd spent all the money and put us into debt. She still bought all the makeup she wanted and hair coloring and booze. I wore her old cloths and even her panties because she wouldn't buy me any. I got into trouble in middle school gym because I wasn't wearing a bra and that made the other girls uncomfortable for some reason. Mother bought me a ratty old one from goodwill. One morning on the way to school, I complained about the outfit she made me put on, and she punched me in the face. She told me that dad had wanted her to get an abortion when she was pregnant with me. She mourned he loss of her unborn child that she'd miscarried and ignored me. She still brought strange people over. Some stole from us. She inspected me more through, asked me if any boys had touched me down there. When she flirted with me in public, she'd push me well out of the way and tell me to go somewhere else. She liked to dress me like a trashy slut, even to school. I was made to change into sweats all the time because she'd refuse to bring me different cloths. She'd beat me for it. She used her fist to wail on me, but never where a bruise would show, and drag me down by my hair and burn me with the curling iron on my ears. For no reason, she'd sit on my chest until I couldn't breath, and lick my entire face while holding me down as I screamed and cried. If I brought a boy home, she'd come out in a skimpy outfit and flirt with them. Any gal pals I brought home, she'd praise and reward to make me jealous. While she no longer picked out my cloths, I had little, only 5-6 shirts and 2 pairs of jeans. Any new cloths that I got, she'd take for herself, even if they didn't fit her. I took over cooking and cleaning the whole house. I rode my bike to the store for groceries. She like to slam me into walls and push me around if I did something wrong. In high school, she'd stay gone for days. The lights and water were always being shut off because she did god know's what with the money for the bills. She made sure I was not shaving my legs or anything else. She made sure I was still a virgin. Dad was working 3 jobs. She stayed at home. Dad went and searched her room and found needles and bags of unknown powder. We left not long after. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "abuse"}

At the same time, roommate and boyfriend's best friend at the time who we'll call, \"Toby\" since Toby is worst of all time, his girlfriend went out of town to the beach with her family. To give some background to the situation, my bf and Toby have been friends since childhood (we were all 19/20 at this time). Toby and I had a weird flirtatious, manipulative on his end sort of dynamic back in freshman year of high school. He got tired of me and told me to talk to his best friend, so I did. He was still butt hurt years later, especially since he and I hadn't spoken much in that time. He had a couple girlfriends, but this one was just as crazy and possessive as he was. They're a perfect fit, especially since she is STILL- as in right now- in high school. \n\nAnyway, so my bf and Toby's gf both leave within a day or so of each other. Toby worked 3 days a week while I worked 5 days. Toby spent most of his ten days smoking weed and snorting pills while telling me not to tell his girlfriend. For a couple nights, he and smoked weed and just talked about the good ole days. He kept making weird comments: \"we wouldn't have made a good couple, we're just too different\" out of nowhere, but I just assume he's high and doesn't know how weird it sounds. This wasn't too weird since we usually smoked together and said dumb shit because we were high, so I didn't think much of his weird comments about he and I being together or anything. One of these nights we smoked and were sipping on some Malibu Rum. We were in his room, which wasn't that weird since he had his PlayStation in there and we didn't want to move it just to play games in the living room. We were pretty decently high/tipsy by this point. All of a sudden, he pulls out these white pills. It takes me a second and I realize it's Xanax. This wasn't crazy to me since he had been snorting way more intense pills than that these past few days. He asked if I wanted to try some, I told him no not really. He kind of huffed and puffed for a while until deciding to just ask me a thousand times to try it with him and being in this already altered state, I said \"Fuck it, sure\". Little did I know that this would be the worst mistake I'd ever make. \n\nHe gave ONE AND A HALF PILLS. This would be insane to someone taking it for fun, and yes I should've looked up how much to take or whatever but fuck off OK? I assumed he wouldn't give me more than a regular dosage. He'd given my bf and I pills before and we did like he said and we were always fine. I trusted him, and didn't think it'd put in a dangerous position. Please keep in mind, he only smoked and drank. We were pretty high and tipsy, not able to drive a car but alert enough to remember what we were talking about. He never took any pills that night.\n\nI take the pill and a half he gave me and after about 30 minutes (or 5 minutes, I genuinely don't fucking know) of \"I don't feel anything\", I blacked out. I don't remember anything from that night (about 11 or so last time I'd checked the clock) to 11 the next morning. I woke up in a t shirt that didn't belong to me or my boyfriend. I had no bra, pants, or underwear on. Only the t shirt. I didn't think much of it as I woke up in my own bed and just assumed I grabbed his shirt from the dyer or something. Then the night slowly made its way back into my memory. I remember to the point of just after taking the pills then my mind goes blank. I open my phone to see if I left myself any clues. I see my phone locked on my text convo with Toby. The convo looked like this\n\n 4:06 am\n\nToby: Missed call\n\nMe: I'm sorry.\n\n\\~Read 4:10 am\\~\n\nToby: Missed calls (4)\n\nIt wasn't much to go on, but I was terrified nonetheless. What was I sorry for? Why did he call me? I hadn't texted anyone else or posted anything on social media. After checking my phone I got up to pee, I could barely stand because my legs hurt so bad. I hobble to the bathroom and pee..I cry out in pain. It hurts so much, my vagina felt torn and sore. There was also a burning sensation. I know what drunk sex from the night before feels like in the morning, but this is a pain I have never felt. I am still groggy but the thought has come to me as clear as day: I had been raped. I felt the urge to cry, but no tears came. The Xanax was making me emotionless. I wanted to puke, but nothing came up. I stand and look in the mirror and see someone, not me, looking back. She has my features, she has my hair, but she looks dead behind her eyes. That's when I see the bruises on her neck and wrists. It was like I was in a movie about someone who had been drugged and raped, it couldn't have been me. There was no way I was dumb enough to let myself be in a position to get raped. That just wasn't me. \n\nBut it was. \n\nI never told anyone. I cried for days once the Xanax wore off (after a few days). The bruise on my neck healed before my boyfriend got back. The ones of my wrists were small and unnoticeable to my already very vision impaired boyfriend. We had sex and I missed it so much, but I haven't felt it the same since. I didn't speak to Toby after that, not alone at least. He acted like I didn't exist most of the time anyway.\n\nMy boyfriend and Toby had a falling out a couple months later and he moved out. Neither of us have spoken to him since, but I've seen him and his girlfriend driving around in his car a couple times.\n\nI wish I'd reported it at the time, I just didn't want to believe it was me. I regret everything about that, I regret that I haven't told my boyfriend yet. I am afraid he'll be upset with me and hunt Toby down and hurt him. I just want to get it off my chest. I can't explain the relief I have felt from getting this out of my head. It brings me some peace.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Narcissist Personality Disorder. Most probably a Narcissistic Sociopath.\n\nOf course, it didn\u2019t start like that. I knew who he was, though we didn\u2019t travel in the same circles. He was mysterious, intriguing, and charismatic. It took a while for our paths to cross to any degree. Looking back I was absolutely ripe for the picking. Empathetic, broken, trying desperately to understand my place in this world and to heal from childhood sexual abuse. Suddenly, there he was. Larger than life. Willing to take me under his wing, discuss spiritual matters, leave behind the mundane that was dragging me down. We were going to conquer the world. Rise above such trivial matters and make our own paths.\n\nSounds awesome, right? Heck yeah. Especially to my lost 20 year old self. He claimed a native american heritage. This was exactly what I had been searching for, I was disillusioned with Christian religion. My spiritual well being was the most important thing to me. I felt (and rightly still do) that by understanding myself, the universe, and our place in it as humans, I could then heal.\n\nI had read the Celestine Prophecy, and the next one whatever that title was. I wanted more. I read other books about native american cultures, I met his new circle, and some followed native traditions. I was hooked. He was so kind, so helpful, so amazing. Here\u2019s the thing though\u2026 he was indoctrinating me as if he was the spiritual leader of a cult. We read the books by Carlos Castaneda. They were amazing. And while I was trying to understand them, he was twisting everything about them to benefit himself. I couldn\u2019t see it, of course. Not with all the spiritual journeys involving the ingestion of mushrooms and LSD. I put all my trust in him. In hindsight there were so many warning signs.\n\nHarry didn\u2019t just spiritually abuse me, there was sexual, mental, and emotional abuse as well. This though is about the spiritual abuse. Any knowledge I gained, any insights, realizations, or epiphanies\u2026 he promptly rearranged and redefined for his benefit and to keep me from actually growing. This is how he abused me spiritually. He made me believe that there was no one else in this whole wide world who would understand me, or my spirituality and if I didn\u2019t stay with him, I would never heal, never grow spiritually and never, ever, be spiritually enlightened (like him), or transcend.\n\nBefore Harry, I was drawn to some Wicca/Pagan things, but not fully. I found and purchased myself these beautiful Tarot cards based around the King Arthur Legends. I collected crystals and rocks. I love rocks! Nature has always been my temple. I was also drawn to some Christian ideology, and Native American beliefs. I\u2019m even partial to Greek Mythology. I also see science as spiritual, and feel that the basis to every belief system is the manipulation and transformation of energy. I\u2019m a bit eclectic.\n\nAll of these things though, were taken from me, little by little. Then given back but redefined in such a way that made Harry the absolute authority in all matters. He even took my Tarot cards and told me I couldn\u2019t use them because you weren\u2019t allowed to buy your own. I was so mentally and emotionally abused, through gas lighting and narcissistic love bombing that I really believed I had to be with him, or I would lose my spirituality. I became no one, I became Harry\u2019s Cary. Nothing was any longer about me, it was all about him. I was conditioned to believe that I could not exist outside of this definition.\n\nAfter 10 years of his abuse, and finally making him leave, I was unsure of my own spiritual connection. I no longer trusted my own intuition. My spiritual well being was no longer the most important thing to me. Surviving daily was. What a narcissist does is insidious. I feel like, even now, I still have all these sneaky dark webs all through me, that I have to pick out one by one.\n\nBut, slowly, ever so slowly, I started to find that connection again. No longer clouded by Harry. Just me and whatever is out there. It was scary. It was a tenuous thread at first, but it\u2019s growing. It took me 11 years to set up my altar again. I have some special rocks and crystals, some driftwood, and shells. I had all of them in a wooden bowl, but I never claimed a space for it. It sat on my dresser, the cats would knock it off, I would leave it covered with piles of clean clothes, or other bits and bobs. About a month ago, I actually set it up. I interact with it everyday, recognizing and honoring my connection to the spirit. I even kept those Tarot cards! It\u2019s taken me 22 years to use them again.

Every time I would go visit her I\u2019d leave feeling worse about myself.I did not realize until a few years ago, that friends were supposed to make you feel good about yourself. This is one of the many reasons I cut her out of my life. I tried to confront her about her abusive behavior a few times , but she wouldn\u2019t own up to it;she would then gaslight me. I would also like to add she hated me, I was her Narc supply. She didn\u2019t care about me or my feelings. Was it rude to go NC without closure?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

All that time money and soul searching just to find out that my ex is a narc and the one before him - the one that sexually assaulted me but discarded me a few months later - he was a narc too. I had a therapist tell me that ex had borderline traits and that makes sense. But he never told me about the idealize/devalue/discard cycle. He didn\u2019t tell me about the triangulation and the gaslighting and how this was trauma. Nobody told me that the guilt and shame and unworthiness I felt because I was with a monster who hurt and humiliated me, but I felt worthless because HE broke up with ME. I didn\u2019t know what a trauma bond was or that this cycle is typical with these disorders. can you heal without therapy? I\u2019m so tired of being lied to and misled.

My friend and her husband are religious, so she is committed to keeping this relationship going. Her husband constantly criticizes her character, deflates her self-esteem, and gets angry at minute things and then threatens to leave her. He also controls her behaviour. Whenever I hear my friend share about her experiences in marriage, my heart just breaks. She is unhappy in her marriage and complains about it, but rationalizes his behaviour as depression and also blames herself that she\u2019s not enough (e.g. not cleaning enough) so he gets frustrated. I\u2019ve asked if she\u2019s interested in going to see a counsellor on her own. She\u2019s kind of interested, but worried because she feels like it might destabilize the marriage more and her husband might become \u201cmore insecure\u201d that she\u2019s seeing a professional. According to her, even after she goes to a ladies\u2019 small group, her husband will ask \u201cwhat did you talk about?

(Experience)", "author": "throwaway-tacocat", "self_text": "I (now 15f) had a narcissistic friend (now 18m) for the most part of last year. He was extremely charming when he wanted to be, and I fell for him much quicker than I usually would for anyone and I told him so. Obviously he was older and I didn\u2019t expect him to like me back, nor was I interested in dating him right then. But I wear my heart on my sleeve so I figured I\u2019d simply tell him. To which he initially responded saying he didn\u2019t feel the same way... but texted me the next night saying he did, and asked me out. I turned him down\u2014I\u2019ve never met anyone I thought was worth even risking putting academics in the backseat for. He took offense and guilt tripped me horribly for a week, and I kept apologizing, over and over, for... making my interests, as a young teen, a priority.\n\nI should have walked away right then.\n\nI did not, because I had the obstinate, foolish belief that everyone I care for, everyone I call a friend, is obviously someone with good intentions and any questionable actions on their part are simply a result of flaws. No one is perfect, right? And surely there is no way that someone I bring myself to care about has malicious intentions. No way I can make such an error in judging character like that. \n\nAnd so I stayed, with the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of that of a five year old who, when presented with a large box of chocolates, proceeds to immediately eat it all, blissfully unaware that she is bound to get sick.\n\nI discovered we seemed to fit like puzzle pieces. Common sense went out the window because I was so infatuated with him. Here was my dream person! And yet, looking back I realize that even though he ticked every checkbox on my Dream Person list... I had failed to account for simple decency and kindness. My list that didn\u2019t have that item because I simply never considered that anyone I could like wasn\u2019t already a kind person.\n\nSuch was my stubborn denial that my best friend wasted hours trying to convince me to cut him off. The only true regret I feel is what I put her through. It must have been exhausting to say the same thing over and over, but she never wavered. I\u2019m a lucky person to have her.\n\nAnyway, cue half a year of having my feelings played with, being lied to, manipulated, guilt tripped and gaslighted. He tried to make me feel jealous by talking about the girls who flirted with him or that he\u2019d had (has?) a crush on, but I would not rise to the bait and simply fangirl over those beautiful girls instead. Deep down, I was aware he was abusive, and by some bizarre logic, that simply made me even more determined to be perfect for him, to not give him a chance to criticize me, and I mean no arrogance when I say I was a perfect friend to him. I listened to his false stories and shared his invented burden without pointing out the contradictions and plot holes I\u2019d immediately noticed, because maybe he just missed some details and I was wrong, right? He was a man who romanticized tragedy, The One Who Knows Pain More Than You Ever Will, the one who had known such great sorrow that surely he should never have a life of true joy. He made me the happiest person in the world and yet often dragged me down so low that I felt worthless; one of the worst panic attacks I\u2019ve ever had was a result of his talk, even though I was begging him the whole time to stop. \n\nIn response to something he said, I once replied, \u201cYou do realize that this is textbook emotional abuse, right?\u201d \n\n\u201cHaha, yeah.\u201d \n\nWe moved on. \n\nSurely someone who realized his behavior was problematic would attempt to fix it. Still, I maintained my arrogance\u2014that of the surety that I choose my friends wisely and he was actively working to reach the enormous \u201cpotential\u201d I saw in him.\n\nOne day, I couldn\u2019t take him playing anymore. He\u2019d just insinuated that our flirtations could be a cause for his academic downfall. Fine, okay. I no longer texted him dirty pick up lines. But two days later, he was back to flirting with me. I\u2019d also consulted someone studying psychology and described his behavior to her, to which she replied that he was almost certainly histrionic. When I looked up the symptoms, it felt like I was reading an accurate description of his behavior. My best friend\u2019s relentless insistence that he would not hurt me so casually and frequently if he loved me was beginning to hit home. I cut him off, and he turned nasty. I asked him whether he\u2019d lied about attempting suicide and several other tragic things he laid claim to. He admitted to doing so, but apparently that was only because if he \u201cwas honest, we\u2019d have never lasted more than a day.\u201d \n\nWho was this person, with such sheer disregard for me being there for him that he accused me of \u201cnot always being there\u201d when I\u2019d sacrificed sleep so many times to listen to him when he claimed to be down? His words hurt. Deeply. I begged him to change and explained what was wrong with his behavior, and I did it in the most calm and polite manner. His response was to say he\u2019d never forgive my words. I told him that for my part, I had no grudges against him whatsoever. Just hurt and disappointed. He eventually blocked me, tired of my pleas for him to consider change and give up being... well...emotionally abusive. That was at the end of December 2017.\n\nA few days ago on Feb 6, after over a month of no contact, he emails me. His tone is friendly; he attached a piano piece he composed and said I might want to hear it since I\u2019ve always loved his music. Which is true, a major part of why I fell so hard is because he is the most talented musician I\u2019ve ever met and I was so happy to find someone to discuss music with. We have impersonal, only music related, emails for 2-3 days. Odd for someone whose last words to me were that he\u2019d never forgive me, like he was the better person in this situation. But I noticed his mails had more and more personal cues for conversation so I brought it to a stop and told him I couldn\u2019t heal if we kept in touch, and asked him to stay away. He responded with a mail that brought tears to my eyes\u2014he only wanted a musical ear! But he preferred and respected my honesty (like he was one to talk.) Life was uncomplicated without me and he loved the feeling. (So why hit me up, then?)\n\nIt hurts, seeing the ugly side of someone you\u2019re infatuated with. It\u2019s like his charm is a mask he can slip on and off. But I can no longer live in denial that at his core, he is an abusive man who has outright denied the wish to change. I can no longer pretend that everyone I meet and care about must be a good person.\n\nOn reflection, I noticed that I was less disappointed and angered by his actions and more upset at myself for falling for it and living in denial. It may seem saintly that my fatal flaw is believing the best of every friend but I see the arrogance of someone who refused to believe she could care, and most importantly crush on, someone with malicious intent.\n\nI am not responsible for his behavior, but I cannot help but feel responsible for the continuation of that behavior. I should have known better. \n\nHave any of you felt this way?\n\nWaking up hurts but I have faith that I will heal. I may be a dumb fifteen year old, but I am a fifteen year old that learns from my mistakes.\n\nThank you for reading.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I moved across US because I wanted to distance myself from family, my chosen field was stronger there, but my choice of areas was primarily him having met online and done LD for quite some time.\n\nEntire relationship was about 2yrs, but we lived together for about a year. He was in hindsight very abusive emotionally, gaslighting etc.\n\nHe ended up breaking up with me, a few months later he asked me out on a date and it was very nice but he said he didn\u2019t want to start seeing each other again. It continued as a booty call sort of scenario for a few months (instigated by me primarily) until I realized how unhealthy it was, and cut it off.\n\nHis next girlfriend admitted to me he was abusive to her as well and she dumped him.\n\nAt that point I met my now ex husband, and moved on and lost track of him.\n\nEvidently he moved 2k miles away and got married to a much younger girl (who I\u2019m almost positive had been dating a very good friend of his. How effed up)\n\nMeanwhile I\u2019m a divorced single mom of 2 kids and it\u2019s been 12ish years since I\u2019d even seen him. I\u2019m working for a company that the office for my job was 2k miles away in the same town my ex lived in (I had no idea at this point mind you) and I couldn\u2019t move there because of custody issues but I end up traveling there for 5ish days at a time fairly frequently. At some point I\u2019m in coffee shop and I see him and I\u2019m like, fuck this is awkward but I can\u2019t pretend I didn\u2019t see him. It was a interesting exchange but readers digest was he knew I was in town already, knew company I worked for and wanted to \u201ctalk\u201d and when my coworker shows up (free coffee on my expense account!) he bails without getting coffee with a pretty lame/vague excuse.\n\nOver the next year or so of me periodically traveling to the same area I mysteriously keep bumping into him in places he had no logical reason of being. My coworker who interrupted the weird coffee shop convo relays he\u2019s seen ex BF hanging out around office on multiple occasions when outside on smoke breaks or getting lunch.\n\nI googled him (actually struggled to remember his last name for a few minutes because I\u2019d tried hard to forget him) and figured out his office building was 4 coffee shops away from the coffee shop he \u201cbumped\u201d into me.\n\nIt was very clear he was creepily stalking me. To the point I went to data center on a weekend (I\u2019m in IT) and sat outside reading for like 2hrs before going inside to start my task. I\u2019m in the secured data center floor working and needed something from the guys who work there and I almost ran bodily into ex as I was rushing out the door. Ex is programmer and had 0 hardware experience and there was no reason he would ever be at a data center like that. It was strange. I strongly suspect he saw me outside and got someone to authorize him access, when I spoke to my account rep he said ex was on a temp access badge.\n\nFreaked me out to the point I ran to account reps office and hid out until he left.\n\nI quit job and haven\u2019t been back but after 16+ years of silence talked to a mutual friend from way back when and evidently he relayed part of this story (omitting the creepy stalker bit) and also stated his then-wife realized he was asshat and dumped him like a bad habit too. Ex-mutual friend stated he can no longer be friends with my ex despite 15yr friendship (like, best friends) because he was .... for lack of a better term insane.

He was weirdly attached to my sister who\u2019s about 9 now, when she was a baby, he was unspreable, I remember my mom always said how great she was with her, when I thought it was uncanny that he payed way more attention to my sibling then her. He started having weird people over I was about 12 or 13, and It\u2019s foggy but I remember I started to get really uncomfortable from their on and cut ties with my mom and moved into my grandmas for a few years, once she went to Vegas, I think I was 14, and rob had my little sister. He came over and was straight twacked out and said there was bees everywhere in the house, and went into my room into my grandmas house, as I had the only computer in my house, I walked into my room and he started calling me names, throwing stuff at me, and I woke up my grandma crying, she chased him down the street. \nI moved around a lot, back in and back out. She\u2019d always put him before me. She\u2019d buy him new shoes when I\u2019d have no winter coat. Or boots. She\u2019d forget to pick me up from school etc etc. He left for a while, and my life improved greatly honestly. I was about 16\u201317 and he came back when I was 17 and was more into drugs. I came back after doing some reckless/ impulsive / living on my own for a few years and came back at 19. Her boyfriend has been around and has been smoking meth in the house for about a year, I find spoons parfinula, and I always have nausea shakes, and my partial seizures have gotten worse, I ask her why she lets him back in after he abuses her. And she\u2019s tells me to fuck off , shut the fuck up constaly.i just simplily ask her why. I don\u2019t question why she wants to live like this, and why she allows it, and why she\u2019s okay that I feel uncomfortable in my own house. I help her pay the bills, and buy food, and I take care of the children 9 and 11. He gets aggressive, and instantly screams at me if I home and not working since he\u2019s trying to get people there to buy drugs, and I\u2019m getting in the way of things. He stands out of the bathroom door, whenever I try to shower or get ready for the day. He dosent clean is never nice to anyone and spends his time mocking, staring, and making threats against people, There is heavy amounts of drug used in my house.

Gosh, I feel uncomfortable about even typing this, because, well, I knew it was inappropriate and I did it anyway.  I wasn't coerced (though possibly groomed) but I went along with it.  I'm really struggling...what does this say about me?\n\nI've read a lot about consent, power differentials, and age.  I know the signs of abuse.  But why don't I consider myself a victim, and just a participant?  Why don't I have strong emotions about it?\n\nIt obviously is weighing on my mind, but I feel like it is only because I'm trying to make sense of why I feel nonchalant about it and what exactly happened in his mind.\n\nSo, years and years later, I found him online.  I thought it would be enough to know what he was doing/where he was (sort of making it real to myself, like, this is an actual person, but no. Oh no.

Why he left the school- was it because when the school asked me pointed questions and i didn't say much but probably said enough?  Though I never heard from the school about it again, and he was gone?\n\nI just have so many questions, and he's really the only one that has answers. So it starts out with the standard \"remember me?\" but it quickly fizzles out.  I ask him if he remembered certain lighter things that were involved during that time trying to sort of get him to open up, without sounding accusatory-because really, I just want him to talk. And now nothing.  He hasn't responded.\n\nSo, one of 3 things:  He really doesn't care/remember; He remembers, but doesn't care; Or, he thinks I'm going to launch into attack mode about everything that happened in the past, potentially opening up a can of worms that would involve a lot of people.\n\nWhy am I obsessing over this? Why do I even care?  Why am I trying to hear from him, when really it's me that I'm trying to learn about?\n\nI'm not even looking for a sorry, just that an acknowledgement that something happened.

This birthday is his weekend, and in years past I used to always make a big deal out of the combined holiday. I knew today was going to be rough so I spent the day with my dad instead, a man that knows how to respect and care for the women in his life that he loves. While I was out, he texted, called, and even left a voicemail. The message was simple, stated above, but today of all days...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe did this to be cruel. He knows how special today is for me, not that he ever made an effort, but less than 24 hours later, on a special day, fresh wounds after a 6.5 year long relationship...and he suddenly wants his stuff back. Stuff that has been in my basement, packed up in boxes for YEARS.  He is doing this now, to be the \"cool detached, I'm not even affected\" guy, the guy he tries so hard to be but he's so broken inside I know it isn't his true self. He saw how emotional I was during our breakup, I told him how I was literally physically ill over this whole ordeal, he said nothing just \"okay then I'll leave you to it.\" Time and time again, and especially now in the end, he has proven himself that he does not care about my feelings at the same level of his own, he'll never even take a second of self reflection to see how he has hurt me. My wants, needs, concerns, will always be secondary to his mood and confidence. He will continue to shut down and push it out and expect everyone around him to adhere to the eggshell path. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFact of the matter is, he may have loved me, but he loved me in pieces, because only then could he pick at the jagged edges and cry about how I made him bleed because it was always ALWAYS my fault, no matter what I did or how I supported him. It was never enough for him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm healing. It was my first love, my first real, long term relationship, my first everything. Only now am I coming to realize and also accept all the things he did/said to me were not okay, not healthy, not what I deserved. He saw my weakness, my want to fix and to help, my codependent nature, and he latched onto it. I know now that my years of hiding his true self, making excuses for him, telling friends and family \"it's not what it seems, he came from a rough household...\" were my band aids to the problem, skirting around the issue to protect myself, to protect him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven typing these words is hard, because I show myself to the world to be a strong person who is fiery, passionate, and so driven. I hated to admit it to myself, let alone my friends, because I was so ashamed of what could be their newfound perception of me. The outside me...and the relationship me. Two different versions. I kept it all secret, in hopes that it would get better. My friends and family that knew him, really saw him for his character, always tried to reach out and say that he was not worth it, and I was so broken that I believed that if he was worthless, and I loved him, that I deserved the worthlessness. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will say it now, and to anyone that asks, because saying it aloud gives me strength to see the truth. It makes it so real. And it makes me able to accept that it happened and to begin the journey of finding all of myself that had been lost over the years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was in an abusive relationship for 6.5 years. I will never get that time back. I will never get my \"dream\" version of him back, because at his core, the real version was toxic, hurtful, and selfish.

The future is bright and I am not afraid to stand in the sun.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor anyone else struggling on this day, of all days, know that it's okay to learn to start loving yourself, to figure out who you are at the core, to feel ALL those feels, and to say them out loud so they're not trapped inside your head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm right here with you, internet stranger.

I know I am biased because of my situation, so, I honestly cannot tell if I am in the wrong or if I'm being guilt-tripped into thinking I'm in the wrong. I need outside opinions. \n\nHere's a summary of the history:\n\nI met my husband in May 2016, we were married a year later and I gave birth to our son in July 2017. He is now 18 months old and I left a month ago. My husband was abusive. It started out small and gradually got worse and worse. First it was him being annoyed by things I did, then comments and hard conversations about things he didn't like about me. Then it was not liking my friends, not letting me have friends, making me delete my social media (which I have since started back up), having uncomfortable fights and uncomfortable sexual encounters, monitoring who I'm talking to via our phone record/going through my phone, worse fights, putting-me down, name calling, yelling, screaming, trying to convince me I'm a neglectful and horrible mother incapable of caring for our son or myself (ex: I lost an earring once and he screamed at me that our son had probably swallowed it, that we would have to take him to the hospital, that he would be bleeding internally and I was killing our son. I had to tear up the apartment while he screamed at me until I found it and then he made me throw all of my earring away), and so on and so forth until I was completely isolated and spent every day determined never to do anything to make him mad. \n\nOnce I called his father to take me and our son away (our son was 3 months old) because I was terrified he would become violent. His father came, talked him down and left. Once he was gone, my husband burned our wedding vows, threw his wedding ring off our balcony, told me our marriage was a sham and that I was childish for \"tattling\" to his father, that I couldn't handle being an adult, that his father could call child services and our son would get taken away and it was all my fault. All abuse was directly in front of our son since I was a stay-at-home mom and he was always with me (in the first 17 months of his life, I had been away from him for a total of 4 hours. I remember this specifically because one of the worst abusive fights was over me being with a friend for that long even though at the time our son was 13 months old and I had hadn't seen a friend or left him at all. I never went out again after that.) This continued to escalate until finally, on Dec 27th, he hit me. That was the moment I knew I had to get out or it would get so much worse. \n\nI had my father (who lives 4.5 hours away) come and get me. I am now living with my father and step-mother (who never got to build a relationship with their grandson because if we did come visit for Christmas - the only holiday I was allowed to come see them for - we would drive the 4.5 hours down, he would only let us stay for 1-3 hours and then make us drive all the way back in the same day). I immediately got a temporary protective order because I was terrified he would follow me or make good on his constant threats that if I left him, he would take our son away.  \n\nNow onto the matter at hand - Parent Time:\n\nOn the TPO I left Parent-Time Visitations to be decided at the hearing. Before the hearing, I heard from my husband's attorney asking that he get Parent-Time beforehand. I agreed because the hearing was 2 weeks away and I knew that as long as I had the TPO, my husband couldn't just take off with my son. The first visitation was supervised by his Mother and Sister who came with to see our son. After that, my husband asked for Parent-Time to be every weekend Sat 3-6 and Sun 11-2. I agreed to this, not wanting to keep him from his son even though I wanted nothing to do with him. I also wanted our son to continue to have a relationship with his father (I am seeking sole physical custody of our son but of course his father would have parent-time!). Eventually he started saying that I was depriving him of time with his son, depriving him of the home he grew up in and depriving his family up north (his mom, dad and sister) of seeing our son. His family had not reached out to me and I realized I had not reached out to them. So, I reached out to them. This is the message I sent:\n\n\"Hey, I wanted to reach out and say that you are always welcome here in (place I am) if you want to come down to visit (our son). I'm more than happy to work out times to come up there, as well to visit. I always want him to be able to build a relationship with his grandparents and I want you to know you can always come see him, too\"\n\nThe initial response was good. His mother was the only one to reply and simply said that she we were well and that until custody/visitation was was sorted out she'd love to have more time with him where I am or where she is. I responded again saying that I was happy she replied and that even though it might be hard because her son and I are divorcing, I still saw them as family. I said I hoped we could work out times for visits and that I wanted to avoid and \"Us vs Them\" situation. I said I didn't want them to feel like they had to rely on my husband's visitations to see our son and that they could see him anytime. At the time, I thought this was a good thing to say. Over the next few days, I sent her videos of her grandson and told her she could do facetime with him if she wanted (I offered the same thing for my husband but as long as I wasn't the one on the phone). \n\nGetting close to up-to-date. My husband continued to send messages (to my father since he's not allowed to contact me directly due to the PO) that I was depriving him of real time with his son and that we had repeatedly denied him more time. Even though every time he asked for more time, we'd agreed (asked for visit before hearing - agreed, it was 2 hours. Asked for next visitation to be both weekend days and 3 hours - Agreed. Asked to come down every weekend for visitation - agreed) and then asked for to have our son from Sat 11am - Mon 4pm and March 1-March 10. This came as a shock because our son is almost exclusively breastfed and has never drank milk from a bottle. He's also never been away from me for longer than those 3 hours (except the one night I was out for 4 hours when he was 13mo). \n\nHe was planning on taking our son up north to see his grandparents and aunt. I was worried that our son wouldn't take a bottle well or that he wouldn't handle being away from me for that long (I should mention my husband was an alcoholic and when we were together was never really available to our son due to his constant intoxication and abuse. In the month we've been here, he's said \"dada?\" twice and that's it). So, I asked if he would be okay with his usual Sat and then only do one overnight Sun 11am-Mon 4pm. I requested (the word request was used) that he stay down south for this first (again, used the words \"this very first overnight\") just in case our son doesn't handle it well. He proceed to respond by saying that I was continuing to deprive him of his rightful time with his son and that if he got the overnight, he would take him for the whole time and go up north anyway and that I was depriving his family up north of time with our son. \n\nThis response made me very anxious about it all so my reply was that if that's how he felt, he could have his usual parent-time, as well as another 3 hours Sun evening and another monday morning and just skip the overnight until parent-time motions are put in place in our divorce. This would be a good time to mention that there are no parent-time or custody orders in the divorce yet. Everything is defaulting to the PO in which it says my husband will have parent-time on my terms. And up until this point, I had agreed to everything he'd asked for. This one just rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nI had also already figured out a time to take our son up north this upcoming weekend. I reached out to let his family know when I would be there and if they would like to set up a visit. That night (last night) I received this message from his mother, father and sister all together:\n\n\"Thank you for reaching out to us re sharing videos, time w (our son). Because he is at an age of rapid change, our keeping up with him, and his being in touch with us via videos is good. But I was clear in my text responses to your offers of 'extra' time and video sharing that it would ONLY be an issue until custody arrangements are imminently set and (my husband) has his designated, rightful time in (up north) with is son, no longer having to travel many hours each weekend; at the point the others of us will have regular time with him as well.\" I should mention my husband has said he's seeking sole physical custody of our son.\n\n\"And when you offered to bring (our son) by to see us when (up north), I assumed you planned to swing by during 'your' time with him, i.e. outside of the time (no doubt, generous) that he would have with his dad. Naturally, we will spend time with him when he is with (my husband) - that is a given. I simply inferred that you wanted to swing by here to connect while you were in town. \n\nPlease coordinate visitation with (my husband) via the process you have in place. Although we all dearly miss (our son) and will go to any proactive length to have him back in our lives, we are uncomfortable and disappointed with what feel to be ulterior motives to your offers\" (My best understanding of that is they think I'm trying to cut my husband out completely? He would have visitation while I would be up there, though.) \"You know well that we love and support (our son), care deeply for his well-being and miss him dearly. Please take the highest care of him while he is temporarily with you.\n\nFeel free to send pictures and videos but recognize that any visitation or arrangement that excludes (my husband) is simply not acceptable. (Our son) needs (my husband). Please do the right thing and do not get in the way of them being together again. And for the next few weeks, prior to custody being established, it would be lovely if you could alternate travel with (my husband), who works full-time, so as to take some burden off of him. \n\nYou said you don't want the divorce to create an 'Us vs Them' situation. I'm very much on that same page. However, if that is genuine, know that attempting to limit (our son)'s time with his father, in addition to causing harm  to the child you  love (the most critical issue of divorce is the well-being of the children involved; the biggest piece of that is parents' graceful agreements to equitable custody agreements for the child), will absolutely create barriers on his dad's side. \n\nAgain: Please do the morally correct thing thing and don't create barriers to (my husband) and (our son)'s lovely and important relationship. Your affirming of (my husband)'s rightful time with his son as his father will facilitate our respect and support for you as his mother.\"\n\nI have no idea how to feel about this. Did I over-step my boundary? Am I an asshole keeping our son away from his father for no reason? My hope was to have him close for the first overnight and if it went well, move to the 2 nights. He even gets him every weekend when most divorces are every other weekend. There's no parent time motions and was told I don't have to give him any parent time at all by my lawyer but I wouldn't do that. I can't consider joint custody due to the abuse. I'm terrified as our son gets older that he will begin to abuse him or if not that, that our son will be exposed to seeing his father abuse another woman the way he abused me. I am 100% open to overnights (as long as our son can ease into them) and giving him parent-time. But I feel like maybe I missed something and that I might be in the wrong. I need advice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL; DR: My husband is abusive, I left him a month ago. I got a protective order that says I can dictate their parent time until a motion is put in our divorce. I have granted all of his requests but he says I'm depriving him of his son. I reach out to his family to see if they want to visit with him and they send me a message that says I need to \"do the right thing\" and not get in the way of my abuser seeing our son.

Basically, he's created an environment from the jump that instills fear in the majority of the class for speaking up. We never truly know what we're doing wrong or right in the heat of the moment, and he's constantly changing the rules on us, having people second-guess what he expects of us in class, it's insanity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe tipping point for me was last week. I came in about 40 minutes late. I have a job and picked night classes, where teachers are usually more understanding of work situations as long as you do the work required. Anyway, as I'm approaching the door, I can hear this man screaming at the top of his lungs at another student. The last words I remember hearing as I stood by the side of the door were \"I know how you black people are!\" and a bunch of metaphors about being lazy/late/uncooperative, etc. . I walk in and he turns to me and screams \"SEE????\" while pointing at me, and I'm like \"See what?\". He then acts like nothing ever happened and resumes teaching. A few minutes later, he asks the same student he yelled at to take out his cellphone to allow him to take a picture of the homework on the board. The student takes out his phone and it begins to ring. As he's turning down the volume and powering the phone off, the teacher accuses him of using the phone in class and \"being disrespectful\", and he erases the homework off the board. When confronted about the shady shit he just did, the teacher feigns ignorance and mutters something about disrespect, and acts like nothing ever happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs much as I need this class to advance  towards my degree, this has been gnawing at me all week, and simply doing nothing is not an option I'm going to entertain. I have not dealt with a person like this since high school (I'm 32 years old), and we're on week 3 of class, and it's already a shit-show. This guy has already shown that he will lie and not take responsibility for anything, so I don't even know if talking to him man-to-man is an option. I am not afraid of this person, but there's no way I can function/learn properly in a crazy environment like this, and I'm sure this is true for everyone else he chooses to bully in this class. For right now, I intend to record every lecture and get everything he says on tape. He does/says something crazy and extremely fucked up every lecture, so catching him in the act is not a hard thing to do in the slightest. What is the best course of action after I capture him on audio? This person isn't fit to be teaching or leading young people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: So I had his class last night. Recorded the entire lecture. He's still bullying the black students for asking questions and completely ignoring me(I was ready to verbally tear him a new one). Now he's on a sexist kick.  1 kid already quit class because of him. It's alot of audio to sift through, 3 hrs worth, but I think I have enough ammo. He has created a classroom environment where learning and asking questions is highly discouraged and I intend to bring that to light. The audio demonstrates how dysfunctional this class has become. Once I'm done editing, I'll post it here. I'll also provide the original for reference.

I'm (29m) in a relationship with my (24f) girlfriend, and I feel as if I've reached a \"do or die\" point in our relationship.  I'm not perfect, I prefer to avoid confrontation, and I will often just let things be rather than stick up for myself.  I can and should definitely be better at communicating, but I don't feel as if I deserve what I've been receiving from my partner.  It's especially difficult because I moved from coast to coast to be with her, and I have no support system here except for her and her family.  Leaving would be financially devastating.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've been together for around four years now, we're currently living together, and things are not going well.  She constantly berates and insults me (\"you're a fucking idiot\", etc.), and on the (too) rare occasion that I ask her to stop, she will say that she is only joking, and that I should stop being such a bitch about it.  To be fair, she DOES have a rather \"crude\" personality/sense of humor, and I knew this going into the relationship, but if we were to have kids one day, I would NOT be ok with this continuing.  I would never in my wildest dreams say the things she says to me, in the way she says them to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe will let the little things get to her, and take it out on me.  For example, if she does her hair and it isn't turning out the way she wants, she will start yelling, swearing, and getting extremely worked up.  If I try to help her out or ask what I can do to make it better, she will snap at me, or worse, make me feel guilty about something unrelated (the house is messy/whatever) so that she can lump BOTH of these things together and take it ALL out on me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe worst part is the silent treatment.  If she is mad about something, she will shoot me a dirty look, roll her eyes in an over-the-top frustrated way, as if to say \"I can't believe you're too stupid and insensitive to realize what you've done to upset me\", and stomp off.  She won't talk to me, she won't acknowledge me when I try to talk to her, and then once she has decided the silent treatment time is over, she will blame me for not making her feel better.  She will tell me that she doesn't even know why we're in a relationship if I can't make her feel better during these times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe will also tell me I'm the \"best boyfriend ever\", and that she loves me more than she's ever loved anyone before.  I feel like a drug addict chasing a high, and her approval and good moods are my heroine.  I feel like the lowest of the low when she isn't happy.  Could I be a better boyfriend?  Yes.  I could be more romantic and thoughtful, I make no excuses for myself, but I would never treat her the way that she treats me when she isn't happy.  The most frustrating part is that after almost four years together, I can't guess what mood she will be in at any given time.

I'd only just got Facebook when a stranger added me, commenting on my prom photos, telling me I was beautiful. I'd never been called beautiful before and was flattered. \n\nHe was friendly, said he was 23, said he went to a university in Texas, and from what I could tell he wasn't catfishing - he *did* have selfies in front of the University, he *did* look 23, he *did* have a legitimate account with lots of friends. No harm in chatting, right? \n\nAs the weeks went on, he told me all about his childhood in India, his fast car, his job, his uni life. He started telling me he was in love with me, and stupidly I believed him.\n\nAt some point he began sending messages of a sexual nature. I was unsure, and tried to steer the conversation away, but he was persistent. It was my first foray into anything like that and to be frank it was a bit exciting. I felt grown up, adventurous.\n\nWe started sharing webcams not long after that, though he was usually studying so we mostly continued to IM. He told me he was going to tell his family in India about me, that he wanted to marry me someday, things like that.\n\nI remember him asking repeatedly to see me naked, asking me to do things for him on webcam, saying if I loved him, I'd do it. I did them - I figured that we were a couple and felt like I owed it to him. He sent me unsolicited dick pics on more than one occasion. I didn't feel violated but I did feel uncomfortable, ashamed.\n\nWhen my parents inevitably found out, I told them we were in love. They tried their best to stop me talking to him, turning off the WiFi after 6pm, monitoring my laptop, etc, but it didn't deter me.\n\nWhen my parents then both joined Facebook and became a constant presence in my online life he stopped talking to me almost entirely. I got very upset, especially when he only tried to brush me off - saying he was very busy with uni work, that he didn't think it was a good idea for us to talk so much any more. Then he either deleted his Facebook or blocked me. The whole thing had lasted about 8 months and just like that it was over.\n\nHe has made a new Facebook at some point; FWIW he works in IT, raises funds for an animal charity, generally seems like a decent person (though I haven't added him or tried to speak to him).\n\nSo... was it some form of abuse? Did he take advantage of me being young and naive? Or, at 16, was the onus on me for not knowing better? I can't tell whether it's just easier for me to consider him an abuser than to admit that I was infatuated, desperate for attention, and gullible. \n\nIf you read all this, thank you - I'd appreciate your opinion.

The two of them met in private and confessed their feelings to each other. She admitted to me that she loved him, and that she wants to date him on the side while still being married to me.

She has insisted that we have to hide all of this information from his ex. Yesterday, she said that they will tell the ex what's going on, but not the entire truth; she still wants to omit any talk of an open 3-way relationship.

She's also been lashing out at me angrily, telling me that I'm \"not making any sense\" that I'm \"not communicating how I feel\" and that \"I keep changing my mind every day.\" I've tried telling her that I'm going through a lot right now, and that I am trying to figure out what I want and how I feel, and that my feelings and thoughts are changing every day because I'm trying to figure out what I want.\n\nShe doesn't understand why I am hurt, and has told me that my feelings don't make sense, because I don't understand the timeline of events that happened, and that my \"facts are all mixed up.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if I want an open relationship or not, but I tried to tell her that the way she brought it up was hurtful and broke my trust in her and our relationship.

She went to therapy for a very long time, and honestly she made a total 180 in terms of behavior and communication with me. We worked on our issues, and spent many happy years together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur relationship has been long distance, and I recently moved to a new country to live with her.

I haven't found a job yet and have no income of my own.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat scared me the most was yesterday. She told me that she was going to talk to her new lover's ex and tell her about the situation (on her terms, that we all must omit any mention of open relationship). Then she asked me if that was a good idea, and I paused for a few seconds of silence to asses my thoughts on the matter.\n\nShe exploded in anger at me, said I can't make up my mind, and that she's tired of my behavior.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the scariest part: She actually literally said \"I'm so angry!\" and then a few minutes later said very calmly \"I've never been angry through all of this situation.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember feeling gaslight, and my whole body went numb, my hands were shaking, and my speech was stuttering.

Was playing Call of Duty:World At War on the nazi zombies gamemode with random people, talked to one of the players throughout the match and he added me afterwards. This guy was in his early-mid twenties, I'll call him by the pseudonym Mack. We hit it off well, Mack became my only genuine friend, I'd get home from school and spend all day voice chatting and playing video games with him. \n\nMaybe several months to almost a year into our friendship, he reveals that he's into kids but supposedly isn't abusive and would never molest a kid. I was alright with it, I had known him for long enough that I trusted him. This was his sign that he had successfully groomed me, he asked for nudes a few times without any pressuring, then let it be for a while. Gradually, he became more and more insistent. Eventually this turned into him saying he was going to kill himself because he felt depressed and seeing kids nude was the only thing that helped. \n\nSometimes this would go on for a few hours at a time, I'd be crying and begging him not to kill himself, he'd just keep going. I never did send him any nudes, not out of resolve, but because I am very shy about exposing myself in any way. That all continued until 2011, when I got addicted to Minecraft and started to make the switch from PS3 to PC gaming. We talked less and less, being on different systems, and eventually fell out of contact altogether. There might have been a few more instances of abuse past that point when I'd still log onto my PS3 to chat with him, but I think it ended within a year of 2011. \n\nSo thanks Notch, your game indirectly cut short my abuse. In the unlikely circumstance that we ever meet, I'll see if I have enough money to buy you a beer, even though you're a super-billionaire and all. Below I'll include a few other snippets that show more of Mack's abominable habits but weren't directly related to the general timeline above. \n\nHe told me about one kid who was apparently stalking him, making multiple accounts to send him berating messages. That kid was pressured into showing his privates on webcam, Mack laughed because the kid wasn't well endowed even for his age. I thought it was funny at the time, now I realize how horrible it must have been for him to be forced into that and then ridiculed for it.\n\nHe also got pictures from many other kids, I know of 3 others at least. He said some of them were nonchalant and completely willing to send nudes, I'm not sure how many of them he had to apply pressure to, but he was willing to get abusive or coercive (he once offered me several hundred dollars) to get what he wanted.\n\nHe also once asked me to ejaculate into a ziploc bag and mail it to him so he could drink it, this guy was several states away. That jizz would have been in the mail for several days. That's just nasty, man. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm traumatized from this. The memories don't bring me distress, but I have certain oddities that might be caused by it like not forming emotional connections with healthy people (My only genuine friend right now is a guy with ASPD), tremoring intensely during any sort of intimate encounter, etc. I'm also autistic and have ADHD so it's even harder to pick apart anything. If I am traumatized, the trauma has fused so completely with my personality that I can't tell where my normal self begins and the trauma ends. Sorry about this being so long.

This is not even my whole story. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been a hard week. I finally went to my campus police and reported what happened to me a year and a half ago, but I feel like I'm just becoming more hopeless and insane. I believe my perpetrator has done this before with other woman (he raped me and beat me on three occasions) and I've been afraid of coming forward about it. He is significantly wealthy, and I'm terrified of going to court, because I doubt that I will get anywhere with it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd to make matters worse, I am trying to get as much information on him as possible. I want to go to the city police and file a report and when I do I want to have as much documentation as possible (receipts that I was in his area of town, I've drawn the inside of his apartment, pictures of the bruises, etc.). So I went online an hour ago and made a fake account on the site I originally met him on and, lo and behold, his account was there. I requested to see his photo, so I could snapshot and save it and give it to the police. But I had to pretend to be interested in him, since he didn't know that it was me behind the screen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe gave out his number like candy (someone with \"high security\" doesn't do that, and something just feels very very wrong about this). His number that he gave me was also different than the one that I knew he had, back in December of 2017. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I feel physically sick after speaking to him. I have BPD and interacting with him has triggered a manic phase. I'm currently on the RAINN hotline waiting to chat with someone and I don't know what to do.

We have been together since 3 years , we had a big break up in between , I ran away from abuse and went back like a crazy person after 5 months . \n\nThis last 3 weeks we had crazy fights . One problem we always had that we cannot even talk because he does not let me talk . Not only when arguing , even in during a standard daily  conversation , he talks without breathing between sentences , and constantly about himself . But when we argue that becomes a bigger issue as I feel the need of explaining myself but cannot find a space to do so . \n\nI tried interrupting him , I was called out on it . I tried waiting until he finishes , so that I can talk . But he interrupts me and talks over me with a raised voice ! I tried walking away as he is constantly blaming me for things and not giving me any chance of talking , and he calls me \u201c abusive \u201c because of leaving the conversation. I tried screaming because I get crazy , He blames me for being insane and raising my voice . I tried staying quiet , he tells me I\u2019m giving him silent treatment and this is \u201cmanipulation\u201d.\n\nI cannot talk , cannot interrupt, I cannot walk away , I cannot scream , I cannot stay silent . What can I do !!?!??\n\nOur last fight was because I asked him to not to text that woman he had sex with , when I broke up with him , about our fights . I saw his facebook that was left open on computer , he texted her next day of our argument . \nI was upset , I said I am open minded enough to let you stay friends with her but Just do not talk about us to her . \n\nHe got mad , he went to work next morning , came back home . He started shouting , saying that I do not care of him , I\u2019m trying to make him go crazy , everyone can see how stressed he is but I cannot . He says you on purpose pick fights with me , and continues.. \n\nI try talking and explaining that I don\u2019t even know why he was saying these , he did not let me speak again . I went upstairs cried the whole night . He came and talked 2 hours over me , about how guilty I am in general of making him feel upset all the time . He keeps telling me \u201c you left me once , everything is because of this . If you would not , all these would not happen\u201d \n\nNext day was valentines day , he slept downstairs. Came to bed for a moment at night . I put blanket on him . And then he suddenly left again and did not talk to me nor came back to bed . \n\nI went to school he texted me , told me he can \u201chelp\u201d me for my issues . ( I have pmdd I get depressed before my period and I want some alone time . He thinks all these is happening because of my pmdd ) . I texted and explained him that I\u2019m not at my pmdd period , I feel very calm and I don\u2019t know why he was fighting with me . He said \u201c can you at least tell me when you will be home , today is valentine\u2019s day , so I will come home depending on you\u201d . I said I will be home around 7.30 evening . I went home at 7.30 after school .\n\nHe did not come . I waited waited and waited . 2 hours , even more maybe . He didn\u2019t come . I felt this pressure raising in my head from sadness and anger and broken dreams of mine . took my belongings and left . He did this on purpose on valentine\u2019s day to hurt my feelings , to get more reaction and blame me with my reaction in return . As I knew he wanted me to call him and text him , I did not . I left in silence . He told me several times before that \u201c if I would not come home I wonder what you would do\u201d and laughed over this . That is what he tried to do on valentines. I went back to my dorm house ( which I cannot live at , because we had another fight when I tried to move to my own room , he was very upset and angry ) after another hour , he texted me \u201c\nI knew you were gonna leave me like this , you heartless sadistic monster , you are fake \u201c \n\nI explained that , he could fix everything today with a single rose . With a nice word , with a piece of chocolate. He chose to play with me to hurt me , hurt my feelings instead . That same person , told me he was still married on my birthday ( he did not even get me anything , never . Not that I want gifts but I want to know that he at least thought about me . ) , and we were at our 6th month at that time . He did the same thing to hurt me on valentine\u2019s day . Called me home and did not come on purpose . \n\nToday I went his home to get my belongings. He guilt tripped me and told me because of me he cannot work , he cannot function , he was looking for housing and he was stressed , he won\u2019t be able to pay alone and will be homeless , all this is my fault , yet I think he did such a thing to hurt me . He called me crazy and insane . Said he sacrificed a lot for me but I never did anything for him .

And then, I found my boyfriend, I had no expectations and just wanted to see where things would go.At the beginning of my relationship everything seemed perfect. My SO was so sweet and kind to me. Sending me sweet messages, FaceTiming me when we were apart (sometimes multiple times in a day), taking me out on dates, treating me with gifts and surprises, and just being what I thought a good boyfriend. From the beginning when I went to school and went out drinking he would always pick fights with me. And he even accused me of cheating, when I never would\u2019ve. When I went out it was just me and my girls. I would be out but wouldn\u2019t even get to enjoy my time out, because I was doing my best to keep him happy. He said his ex cheated on him, and ensured me he wouldn\u2019t do such a thing. But then, a few months ago my boyfriend cheated on me. I\u2019m not excusing him in anyway, but instead just providing context. My boyfriend went through a major life change ( I won\u2019t get into details on what that was). He blamed it on being on a fuck ton of benzos.  Also when I first confronted him I saw an ugly side of him, he began verbally attacking me and trying to hurt me even more. But right after he apologized and seemed like he wanted to make things work. Anyways I decided to stay and work things out, because I thought he was special. He expected me to make a choice right away and forgive him. Fast forward to closer to present day, this still haunts me, because I never got full closure. I ended up bringing it up and I was in shock what he had to say. After we talked briefly about the incident he just says \u201c can we stop taking about this and can you just pretend everything is fine is even though there\u2019s things on our minds, I don\u2019t want to focus on the past anymore\u201d.  And honestly I thought that was kinda fucked up. He\u2019ll be sweet to me, but then he\u2019ll say some stuff that will make me sketch me out and he\u2019ll just say he\u2019s kidding. I can\u2019t think of a specific example at the moment. He\u2019ll be distant sometimes and other times he\u2019ll just shower me in affection.  I just chalked this up to his depression.. I also feel he lacks communication. At first he opened up to me and told me about his dark past. But now he doesn\u2019t want to talk about things, and keeps them in. Even though I\u2019m nothing but open with him. I get not wanting to talk about somethings( because it might be hard to), but no communication isn\u2019t healthy and doesn\u2019t solve anything. Also there have been times where he just seems to ignore me and not talk or give me affection until he gets his way. I\u2019ve found myself so stressed and hurt about numerous things these past few months. This doesn\u2019t include all the things that have me question the relationship, but it\u2019s been enough to make question what his true intentions are. ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

He started devaluing me last Fall after I found out he had spread a rumor about me and I confronted him on it... then (I think) discarded me in December, although it\u2019s hard to know for sure since we still have to see/talk to each other on a regular basis. I know he\u2019s been cold and distant and when I ask him about it, he gaslights me and says everything is fine. I know it\u2019s not fine. \n\nHe\u2019s a covert narc and insanely insecure. He talks shit about everyone, no matter who they are. He even said a few not so nice things about his new supply way back when - basically calling her white trash. She also works for him, but in a separate area than me. \n\nI know he\u2019s been grooming her for awhile and I can tell now it\u2019s his full-blown supply. I can tell she\u2019s eating it up too, she used to wear sweatshirts and jeans to work (a have a lax dress code), and now every time I see her she\u2019s dressed up, makeup on, hair curled, etc.\n\nA few weeks ago, I had a meeting scheduled with him right after a meeting he had with her, and I walk over and can hear them laughing and her giggling. The narc is in full-blown charm mode and I get a knot in my stomach. He used to do that with me. I used to sit in his office for hours where we would just talk and listen to music and enjoy each other\u2019s company. I\u2019m so jealous of her that she gets that now. She get the good parts of him and I get the asshole. \n\nI know it\u2019s just a matter of time before he devalues her too. And I\u2019d almost feel sorry for her if she weren\u2019t such a bitch to me (yes, typical triangulation, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m pure evil in her mind). She knows we were best friends and is probably feeling like she\u2019s on cloud 9 thinking he chose her over me. I know how my narc thinks though, he\u2019s going to ditch her because she doesn\u2019t fit the \u2018ideal\u2019 in his mind of the people he should surround himself with. Even with her primping, she is still a low-level employee and I know the narc (an executive at the company) sees her as beneath him. He\u2019s very concerned about image. Once she gets too obsessed he\u2019ll drop her. For right now I think he just enjoys the attention and will take what he can get since I\u2019m painted black. I was his primary secondary source (#2 behind his wife) for 3 years so I know he\u2019ll be back at some point.\n\nIn the meantime though, I can\u2019t help but cycle through feelings of jealousy and pity for this girl. I know I should just pity her, she is going to get her heart broken when he tosses her away like garbage. He\u2019s triangulating her against me and manipulating her 100%, just like he did to me when we first became friends and there was another supply in his life. I stupidly fell for it, so I guess this is karma seeking its revenge. \n\nDoes anyone else find it hard \u201ctaking the high road\u201d and not completely hating the new supply?? We know what our narcs are, we know what they are doing (manipulating) and what the end result will be for their new supply. I want to be the better person and not feel this jealousy.

I wouldn\u2019t tell him if I had been on a date with someone else or not..even claimed someone he knows saw me and took a picture of me on a date...and still I wouldn\u2019t confirm or deny because he had discarded me so what business is it of his. Well ...he discarded me again when I refused to tell him yes or no... calling me fake and a liar and just being cruel...and once I said ONE thing about him threatening me with the sex tape just WEEKS ago ...he hung up on me and I went no contact... it\u2019s been 7 days now and still has been a struggle for me to come out of the cycle that had become so familiar to me over the last 3 years. The CONSTANT discard (I never broke up with him even in the end), silent treatment, smear campaign, hoovering, Love bombing, and discard again has left me feeling dazed....and tired and questioning myself. I know there were many times I handled him and his host of emotions harshly...and he made me feel horrible about it but I\u2019ve never experienced emotions like his before...when I started trying to help him and say hey I think something maybe wrong and I think you have some esteem and insecurity issues..I would try and SHOW him how extreme he was in his up and down emotions.. I would take screenshots of texts he would send professing his undying love for me and then HOURS later over nothing at all really...I would get messages of hate... I would say LOOK it only takes hours for you to go from extreme love to extreme disdain and disrespect! He would explain it away and claim that I was trying to make him out to be some crazy and bad person when really he had only done the things he had because of me and my actions or how I made him feel...he would say \u201cI was never this person before I met you\u201d all his apologies included \u201cif you hadn\u2019t done this, I wouldn\u2019t have done that\u201d... but still I held onto hope that he would one day \u201cget it\u201d and stop his irrational emotional and extreme reactions to all situations big and small... I think it\u2019s hard for me to let go cause it\u2019s hard to let go of the extreme hope I had... now my hope is that one day (soon) I will be able to completely move on and not look back ...ever again..but I\u2019ve had this hope every time I was discarded by him.

Is this emotional abuse, or a normal reaction to not getting an engagement ring?", "author": "Ataraxia5283", "self_text": "Hi NarcissisticAbuse,\n\nI want first to say that I don\u2019t know if my partner is officially a narcissist. She exhibits some traits that I\u2019ve seen discussed around here, but hasn\u2019t done the traditional \u2018discarding\u2019 that most seem to do. \n\nWe have been together for four years. We\u2019re both fairly young (early 20s) and this is the only relationship either of us have had. For the first two years, things were good. There was the odd bump here and there (she has a temper and I\u2019m bad at speaking up when something is bothering me) but for the most part we were solid. Things changed just before our second anniversary. My best friend and his now-wife got engaged after being together for five years. When I found out, I was ecstatic for them. I\u2019ve been really close with both of them since we were kids, and they are a perfect fit for each other. When my SO found out, she said she was happy for them but it felt forced to me. \n\nOur second anniversary hit and things started to fall apart. I planned a nice dinner and some after dinner entertainment and as a gift had planned a nice trip for us (just to confirm which dates worked for her). When it became clear I wasn\u2019t proposing, she shut down. She criticized everything I planned for the evening and told me she would not be going on any trip with me. She even mentioned over dinner that she doubted we\u2019d be together much longer. I had no idea what had happened, so I just kept trying to cheer her up to no avail. The next day I didn\u2019t hear from her. She only eventually messaged me to say that she had been crying all day because she felt unloved. She told me she needed to get engaged within six months. I, being flustered and scared of losing my love, said we could do that. \n\nThe more we talked about getting engaged, the more worried I became that she wanted to do it for status more than love. She wanted a ring that would have cost more than half of what I make in a year (I\u2019m a grad student). She wanted to get engaged \u201cso everyone would know [she\u2019s] loved.\u201d She wanted to get married in line with our friends. When I raised the concern that I didn\u2019t think we were ready, she became furious and accused me of not loving her again. \n\nIt\u2019s now been two years since she first demanded I propose and she has continued to do so every few weeks (especially around holidays, anniversaries, and birthdays). It doesn\u2019t matter what I do; nothing ever seems good enough to her. And because I haven\u2019t proposed, I get to hear a lot about how I (and our relationship) am disappointing to her, how she\u2019s going to die alone, how I\u2019m incompetent, etc. My family heard her talking to me like that and they\u2019ve expressed their concern over how she talks to me as well. She caught wind of their concerns and now she has started guilting me over their \u201cdisrespect\u201d for her. It\u2019s been over a year since I\u2019ve been able to see her and family and have everyone be happy to see each other. \n\nMore than anything, she has become vicious with anyone who gets engaged or married now. She was in the bridal party for my best friend\u2019s wedding, but any time they weren\u2019t around she would speak so poorly of them, culminating in her telling me about how much she wished the bride and groom would die. When I called her out on her cruel comments, she got mad and told me I just wasn\u2019t being supportive and undermining her feelings. These people are basically my family and I felt sick hearing her say those things but she had me convinced I was just denying her rightful emotions. She has since calmed about them and claims it was just her anxiety talking, but that still seems extreme to me. Now when she wants to see them I come up with excuses why we can\u2019t because the thought of seeing her fake nice with them after all she said has me sick. \n\nLast September I actually broke up with her after a particularly bad period, but my guilt overtook me and I began speaking to her again almost right away and things haven\u2019t changed much from before. I really wanted to get married to her at one point, and part of me still does. But her behaviour over the last few years has given me serious pause about whether I should. I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m looking for advice per se. i just needed a place to vent. I\u2019m sorry this has gotten so long, but thank you for taking the time to read it. \n\ntl;dr: partner of four years demands marriage for seemingly the prestige of getting married and acts out because I haven\u2019t proposed", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I dont know the details but that's enough for me to let him be. But she wont leave him alone. \n\nUpfront he made her feel like they were building a future together but then shut her down a few times but made her feel bad bc he has a dream to move and open up his own business. All of her family lives near her, so it would be a big step for her to move.\n\nI have been supportive but when I found out that he was in prison and for murder I had to try and guide her on a different path. Well he stood her up again and ended up in jail for selling stolen guns and drugs when he was supposed to be with her. He had the nerve to get his brother and mom to call her to ask for bail money. she has never met them and not to mention, he knows she is a single mom struggling trying to do the best for her and her son!!

We were together for 4 months. It felt like 6. I am 80% convinced he has NPD or some other mental illness. The other 20% writes him off as a confused Fuck Boy with commitment issues. What I keep turning over in my mind, though, is that he put me through a textbook Idealize-Devalue-Discard cycle. Everything I read about narcissists seems to fit. Even down to the slightly gleeful tone of when he dumped me a few weeks ago. I was devastated. How could this dream of a man, WHO INTRODUCED ME TO HIS PARENTS, just up and \"fall out of love\" with me? I plan on making more posts about my experience, but since finding this sub today, I feel like I have to share SOMETHING. And quotes off the top of my head (and screen-capped) might suffice for the time being. I am new to this sub, so I am not sure how my post will fit into the greater context yet. I hope someone gets something out of it.\n\n* ***\"Look how broken you are.\"*** He said this to me as I was crying during The Great Discard. He held my cheek in his hand and traced my brow and tears. At first I thought it meant he was sympathizing with how hurt I was. Now I realize it was him enjoying the effect of the dumping had on me. He was able to validate how important he was, through my pain. \n* ***\"I think we both suffer from crippling self doubt.\"*** This was a text from very early on. I can't tell if it's actual self-awareness, or him trying to mirror me to get inside my head and find vulnerabilities. \n* ***\"Your feelings are lying to you.\"*** He said this to my friend (who dated him briefly), after she refused his advances. He tried hoovering her with a dress and he threw this line out in response to her saying she felt like he was trying to buy her back after she told him she wasn't interested. It is by far, the most powerful mantra to me whenever I need to remember how manipulative and cruel he is. It's such a disgusting thing to say.\n* ***\"Isn't it easier to give me the benefit of the doubt and believe I have good intentions?\"*** This is another line he sent my friend in the same conversation about the dress. Gross.\n* ***\"I like being out of control. I thrive on chaos.\"*** He said this to me in a post-breakup phone call, as a way to describe how he enjoys life when he has to overcome a lot of challenges simultaneously. Like when he moved to a new city. It's a very weird thing to say.\n* ***\"You deserve better.\"*** My friend said this is the new \"It's not you, it's me\".\n* ***\"I don't think my needs are being met. I don't want to change you. I can't change you. Because of that I don't want to keep trying.\"*** Lines like this make me wonder if he really had bad intentions or just was shitty at being an abuser. Is he admitting defeat? Was I too difficult to manipulate and he is acknowledging that? Or is this just a \"nice\" thing to say during The Great Discard to make them look good and feel better about what they are doing?\n* ***\"I am not lying, I am not good at it\".*** Okay, sure.\n* ***\"I was a hypocrite and I admit it.\"*** This was another line from our post-breakup phone conversation. I was calling him out for promising a future together and then getting cold feet when he actually had to commit. What Narc says this!? Actually admits a flaw and that they were 'wrong' in a sense? It's not consistent with the rest of his behavior.\n* ***\"Passions are more important to me than people.\"*** From the post-breakup phone conversation, on discussing how his needs in a relationship are a shared passion or challenge, and not emotional support or socializing.\n* ***\"It was fair of you to ask for emotional availability and support but giving that is not a need for me at the moment.\"*** Again, a strange thing to say. It skirts on the verge of self awareness. He knows he doesn't want to be emotionally supportive, but admits it isn't an unreasonable request.\n* ***\"It's normal to want support when feeling stressed and that wasn't an unreasonable expectation.\"*** See above.\n* ***\"You're getting yourself really worked up.\"*** This was his favorite line to gaslight me with if I ever got upset that he was withdrawing, not making time for me, or acted contradictory. The scary thing is, I believed him. Because he told me in the beginning of the relationship he never wanted to gaslight me.\n* ***\"Why does this matter so much to you? I feel attacked!\"*** One of the responses he said to me on our final date when I decided to confront him with a red flag I noticed: He didn't have any close friendships. He lived with 2 roomates who were also co workers. He didn't have any other friends of his own from the place he grew up, went to college, or from other jobs. He didn't understand why I thought this was strange. He didn't understand how this was an indication of a problem. I expressed clearly: \"Because it makes me think you can't maintain long term emotional connections\". Later that night he dumped me.\n* ***\"I know this is a shitty thing to say, but you are making me look bad. People are going to assume I am the bad guy.\"*** He said this to me as I was crying in public after our final date. \n* ***\"What can I do to get you to stop crying?\"*** Legitimate guilt after breaking my heart? Or just trying to distance himself from the situation he created?\n* ***\"Your struggles are my struggles.\"*** An early love-bomb statement that made me feel supported.\n* ***\"I like the outline of my penis in this one.\"*** A caption to a nude he sent me. What a ridiculous man.\n* ***\"We aren't in a committed relationship.\"*** He said this to me in confusion, despite the fact he told me he wanted to move in together. After he had already introduced me to his parents. 3 months into dating. Like...what do you think this is!?\n* ***\"A relationship means exclusivity and undivided attention, but not commitment.\"*** HOW IS THAT NOT COMMITMENT?\n* ***\"If I could sum up our relationship in one word, it would be 'Guilt'.\"*** Post breakup phone conversation. He said he was unhappy for months but didn't want to tell me because he was afraid of hurting me. Truth or lie?\n* ***\"You are stronger than you think.\"*** Something he said to me during the dumping. Backhand compliment? Motive unclear.\n* ***\"I don't want you to work on the relationship, only what makes you happy\".*** This was a line from when he was dumping me. Again, a weird thing to say for a supposedly evil person.\n* ***\"You were fun in bed, but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.\"*** What a fucking tool bag.\n\nI realize a lot of this is spinning my wheels. The sad part of all of this is there are still days I miss him. The honeymoon stage was one of the happiest time periods of my life and I truly thought I had found \"the one\". During those 2 months, he was everything I ever wanted in a partner. And that was by design. I am currently mourning the death of the man I loved. And the future he painted for us. I am sure from the outside looking in, it seems incredulous I still care about him. But as any victim of a narc knows, they are very good at getting you hooked. The sex was the best I ever had, to date. I have TONS of love-bomb texts that are the epitome of charming. I plan on posting them eventually as a resource. Apparently these people use similar lines on their victims. \n\nI have not had contact with him in 2 weeks after a text exchange following our last in person meeting. He answered the door in a tiny towel, fresh from the shower. I told him I was coming in advance to pick up my furniture, and he blatantly was trying to lure me back with his body (which is admittedly, a nice one). I rolled my eyes internally. He asked if we could talk, but I said I couldn't because my friend was helping me move my furniture. Later he texted me about how he missed me and even though he is glad we broke up, he still has feelings for me. I told him he was being cruel and gave him an ultimatum: He needs to go to therapy if he ever wants to date again. He said he will consider it. I don't think he will go. But I also can't tell if he is self-aware enough to know his unhappiness stems from a possible personality disorder. He is aware he isn't \"like other people\". At the same time, he didn't let on that he had any problems with that.\n\nIt is an air-tight ultimatum that has kept me from reaching out to him. I don't want to be with someone who doesn't think they need help, or can't help themselves. Especially after what happened in our relationship. I told him I can't make him go, and that he has to want it for himself. That was the last thing I said to him. \n\nI can't tell if he is truly a malicious person or just clueless. I don't understand his motivations. Maybe that's how good of a liar he is. But the discrepancies in his behavior and high intelligence makes me think there is some hope for him. Even if we never see eachother again, I want him to get help. I see a broken person. I have made my peace that I can't fix him. I wanted to, so very badly. But my amazing friends who have helped me through this breakup reiterate that his problems are above my paygrade, and it's not worth wasting my life on a project. His mental health is his responsibility. \n\nI am on a healing journey right now. I read \"Psychopath Free\". I am reading \"Women Who Love Too Much\" and \"How To Fall Out of Love\". I recommend them all. I also plan to get \"Women Who Love Psychopaths\". I read a slew of articles on Psychology Today and feel he was a textbook \"Romantic\" love style narcissist, where he actually did feel the initial love in the relationship, but is more in love with courtship and dating than me. He is unable to maintain an actual emotional connection long term in his current state. If he ever reaches out to me again, that link will be the first thing I respond with. \n\nI overshare, and talk to anyone who will listen, about my story. I have met a lot of other victims as a result. It's comforting to know I am not alone. It's violating and validating to know this is A Thing, and not a one-off. Despite all of this, I kind of still want to be friends? He has few of them. Maybe no one has ever told him he may has a problem. I realize I form Trauma Bonds. I have trouble letting go of people. I don't think EVERYTHING we talked about or shared interest in were fabricated. Is it possible he is on the milder end of NPD? When I \"move on\", is having a friendship possible? \n\nIn the month since he dumped me, I have gone through the gamut of emotions. I went from being inconsolable, to functional. It still hurts, but it gets a little easier every day. I also went from wanting to get back together, to establishing a condition for such, to realizing he probably is bad for me, to affirming he is toxic. Maybe one day I will not want to be friends with him. At the moment, I want to focus on myself and build my life. And it is possible when I feel like I am in a better place, I will realize he doesn't deserve to be in my life.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I know part of the recovery is closing the door on some people who just make you go back into that negative feedback loop, cutting your losses. \n\nI've kept my depression and CPTSD a secret from people; only close friends and family know about these.I have a twin brother who took my CPTSD and my need to get help as an personal attack on himself; that he didn't get any attention because of it and had to \"suck it up\". He never intervened or stood up for me when some of my abusers came for me during all those years at school even going so far as to join them at certain points. He's even friends with them now.    \n\nWhenever something bad happens and my brother feels the need to throw someone under the bus, a lot of the time, I'm the designated person. He always seems to throw the blame at me with his victim mentality for things that I have either little to no contribution in to the point that he slanders and demonises me to my own peer group like when his relationships fail or if I speak up against his ideas. He likes to downplay a lot of the traumatic things I've been in despite the medical diagnosis and treatment I've been undergoing or even using it as a point to get me to shirk e.g calling me \"depressed fuck-up\".  My parents just \"want peace\".\n\nBeing kinda reserved and quiet all the time doesn't help much. I know healthy connections are a fundamental part of recovery. Does anyone have any tips on how to address these issues of being misunderstood? I can't really move out of the house or make friends easily because of his characterisation that all I do is ruin his life.  I think we all know, I have bigger fish to fry with depression, glaucoma and CPTSD  than to deal with his cries from his victim mentality. \n\nHow do you step out a characterisation that you don't even get a chance to clarify or change others' minds? My therapist identified this as a key obstacle in recovery.  I know I shouldn't care but I have to still live at home and it drains me. Going out is already difficult with my job and tiredness from my conditions.\n\nHope you guys have some wisdom to share. ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Just what my mama gave me, and all that. \n\n3 years later, and I\u2019m more like a lamppost. Now it\u2019s all \u201cMimi, you\u2019re so skinny.. are you okay? You\u2019re so thin omg\u201d. And I\u2019ve tried, in those periods where we don\u2019t talk, but I can\u2019t get it back. Sometimes I\u2019ll stand naked in front of the mirror and just cry. I can see my ribs, my boobs don\u2019t exist. I don\u2019t even feel like a woman. And it\u2019s a constant reminder of you. \n\nMy face is all scars now. I never got spots before. Sure, the odd one around my cycle but not like this. When things got bad, my skin protested so hard. And I fought, with lotions and potions and acids and lemons but no, it only got worse.

I was there to unleash your hate and spite, but still I taught you kindness, how to help; I gave you everything until I couldn\u2019t. You started going out more. You started cheating more.

We had been dating since the beginning of university and he was my first serious SO. Everything was seemingly perfect at first and I fell hard for him, but then the criticisms started, unending arguments which he inevitably always won, turning me against my friends and family by pointing out all of their flaws. And gas-lighting almost daily, which genuinely made me believe I was incapable of remembering anything because I was dumb and there was something wrong with me. I found out he was trying to cheat on me a year into the relationship when I saw tinder open on his phone. I decided to stay with him even though I was going on a 6 month trip abroad. He told me he loved me and didn't want to be with anyone else, and that he'd wait for me to come back. Unsurprisingly now but surprisingly at the time, my friends notified me a week into my trip that he was back on tinder. After gaining a lot of distance, therapy, and reconnecting with friends and family, I realized I needed to end things for good ultimately. And I did end them completely by May (no contact at all), but then I had to come back to university.\n\nWhich brings me to my current issue. I had felt myself healing over the summer and the previous few months, but this semester he is in one of my lectures (of about 30 people) that meets three times a week and also in my lab section (10 people) so that I am required to be in his presence for at least 6 hours every week now. I've tried to switch my courses around but I'm a senior and I cannot move my schedule anymore as I need these courses to graduate. I've accepted that I can't change my schedule, but now I'm wondering if any of you have advice on how to deal with seeing him so much? It's driving me insane because I just remember all of my negative emotions and memories every time I see him; just makes the pain stronger again.

When I\u2019d asked why he didn\u2019t date HER he said some vulgar things about her, specifically about her yellow teeth, her weight, her laugh, how she showed up to his house one day when he said NO. Yet he continued to LEAD HER ON all this time via text/messaging never ever actually seeing her. \n\nI assume she\u2019s still there as right before I\u2019d left she unblocked the block she had on FB for him. \n\nI\u2019ve been mad at her, because I\u2019ve earnestly reached out in an effort to HELP her, prevent her going through what I am, although I can see he\u2019s already got her. I\u2019ve seen messages from her saying \u201cI thought you changed this time but you didn\u2019t\u201d then her back to apologizing for doing nothing, calling him 8 times in a row and so much more.

SINGLE. TIME-she asked him for dinner or to come over for dinner and he made some excuse as he had - for the past 7 years... WHY IS SHE NOT GETTING IT?? I know she has an idea but must be in denial- because when she called to harass me she even called him out on how \u201che\u2019s not a good friend, he couldn\u2019t even answer the phone or call her back or \u2018come to her rescue\u201d when she had a flat tire. So she knows damn well he is not there for her. Granted he can\u2019t even change a tire, and he wouldn\u2019t leave the house and risk embarrassment for that, would he? NO. He\u2019s already letting her down and showing his true self. \n\nSee, she doesn\u2019t even really know him, the same way she didn\u2019t know me or even have an actual clue about the truth in the \u201crelationshit\u201d. Regardless of how similar it was to whatever they had going just minus any actual physical seeing. \n\nShe\u2019s going to learn in an even more unsettling way then I did ( I think) and I do feel bad, but she\u2019s self subjecting herself to him knowing damn well the outcome. She\u2019s fooled by this idea they are friends. She is supply and in denial. She is used and I know this I\u2019ve seen and witnessed it first hand. \n\nI have the text between them. And I really want to share that somewhere( all names blocked obviously). Maybe just to get it off my chest.

To be honest not having him pick up and drop of the kids was a relief. The kids and I weren\u2019t feeling this anxiety and stress anymore literally in just a matter of two weeks. Recently though, he\u2019s continues with the manipulation and abuse I decided the kids stay home this weekend. For the first time ever, I always said I\u2019d never keep the kids from him and I haven\u2019t up until this weekend. He\u2019s saying I\u2019m causing emotional trauma and parental alienation once again. It\u2019s like a slap to the face hearing him say this because for years this man he abused me mentally, verbally and physically and he thought it would never affect the kids and if it hadn\u2019t we wouldnt be in family counseling the girls and I. The psychotherapist even told me they would prefer he didn\u2019t show up to counseling because they don\u2019t want to be manipulated by him. We all know how great narcissists at manipulating. So anyways here we are now, he refuses to bring the kids child support because I won\u2019t let him see the kids this weekend. His gf is texting and accusing. Me of parental alienation and he claims this isn\u2019t right. \n\nI\u2019m their mother, I\u2019ve been doing it all alone since the day they were born, he helped sometimes. All he while he was on drugs for years and I was the victim of narcissistic abuse. I no longer want him in my life, I don\u2019t want this life for my kids and me. I know the kids need a father but at what risk? He\u2019s terrible. For the past seven months his gf had been their every single weekend the kids are supposed to spend with him, they OFTEN go down to the basement to get wicked fucking stoned, he doesnt bathe the kids during the weekend, his supply plans the trips to make him look like father of the year, the girls claim they spend more time with grandma and grandpa then they do with him. (He lives with his parents), he constantly buys them toys instead of getting they actually need, when the kids are with him he doesn\u2019t let them talk to me, he says I coach the kids, he\u2019s lied to the school about the girls being sick but really he was taking them to a carnival and when the school called me I had no idea the kids weren\u2019t in school, he doesn\u2019t ever get involved in the kids lives at all, He doesn\u2019t bother asking how the kids are doing or if they need anything, THE LIST goes on. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to even think, I\u2019m not a bad \nMother for wanting to remove a toxic abusive person out of my life.

You will make me the \u201cbad guy\u201d because of it to your friends and family. You will be the victim. But I just couldn\u2019t fight anymore. No one sees you the way I have learned to see you. They just don\u2019t know what it was really like. You put on a good show. \n\nNow I live my life like a zombie. Afraid to make choices for myself because I\u2019ve been conditioned to believe I\u2019m not capable. I know deep down I am. Being alone again is giving me back my strength, little by little. One day, I\u2019ll be fine again. I just wish that day would come soon. \n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When I first watched the film, a repressed memory that I had forgotten all about suddenly resurfaced. After watching the scene where it is revealed the main characters aunt sexually abused him as a child, I suddenly zoned out and had some sort of flashback of my childhood abuse at the hands of my aunt. After realising what she had done to him as a child, I became absolutely hysterical, remembering the same thing happening to me. I recall screaming and crying into my palms, to drown out the sound so nobody could hear me. I cried and screamed so much, it felt like I was clawing at my insides trying to get everything out.\n\nI was a young girl, and didn\u2019t know how to react, so I kept it bottled up inside as deep as I could. Around two years later, I watched a film called \u2018Mysterious Skin\u2019 which uncovered even more memories I hadn\u2019t been able to recall before. This movie was about a gay teenager who had been groomed by his coach as a child. I think this film uncovered even more memories because coming to terms with my sexuality, with being gay, is a struggle I\u2019ve been faced with since I was young. I was raised in a Middle Eastern family, so being anything other than straight is looked down upon and forbidden. Realising what happened to me made me feel dirty. I felt dirty for being abused and I felt dirty for being gay. I felt like I deserved it. \n\nWhile watching a scene where the character laid down as a young child, I paid attention to the reflection of a blue light on his face. The blue light suddenly made me remember the blue tint of the television down the hall which was visible from my aunts room one particular night. I remembered my grandmother walk in and check to see if we were asleep, and my aunt closed my mouth in an attempt to not get caught. This particular memory made me realise that my aunt had done this to me multiple times. These two films are the reason my traumatic memories resurfaced.\n\nFor years I never knew why I was so hungry for my aunts affection as a child. My parents had to leave me at my grandmothers home every weekend as a child because they had to work, so I spent most of my childhood with my aunt. The main thing that brings me shame is that although remembering what happened to me has ruined the way I see myself, I can\u2019t bring myself to hate her for what she did to me. As confrontational as I am, I can\u2019t bring myself to confront her about the situation either.\n\nWhile I try my hardest to be confident in my sexuality and accept myself for who I am, part of me feels as though I deserved the abuse. Part of me feels like the abuse wasn\u2019t as bad as I remembered, and that I \u2018turned out\u2019 gay as a result of everything.

Some bg: friends for years, barely dated before marriage- the short time we dated he acted like the horniest man alive. The first time we had sex- I was a virgin- it hurt for a week and I was worried he\u2019d be turned off by my clamped up body. He got annoyed with me for getting sad about it and \u201cruining the week for him\u201d. However sex stopped being painful and I began to enjoy it- I wanted to try everything since inexperienced. He often stopped me from initiating different or more fun things, even PDA. Within 3 months of marriage he stopped initiating sex. No matter- I continued to. Eventually we\u2019d only have sex with me on top/doing the work. Other things coincided with this - he\u2019d gaslight issues I had, if I wanted to talk about how he promised he\u2019d come to look for an apartment with me but he instead chose to work on his hobby. He laughed at my concern that he seemed to care less for me, said I was being a child- this was in every area of our lives and I felt like something was wrong with me for \u2018creating issues where there are none\u2019.\n\nA year or two later I began to exhibit extreme anger. Unfortunately I can\u2019t remember if he rejected me sexually (headaches tiredness etc) before or after I started to let the rage out- but he switched to cruel in his rejection after I approached him saying it was an issue I thought we need to discuss or maybe go to a counselor for, he was in his go-to mode of \u201ccommunication\u201d with me: lying on the couch playing a game on his phone and not looking at me- he said scathingly that I can get on top and do all the work if I want to have sex. I cried a lot since marrying him. I was pathetic. My emotions were all over the place and I felt like I was losing the confident driven side of myself. And he\u2019d ignore my emotions, indifferent and occasionally frustrated, telling me point blank we didn\u2019t have problems to fix.\n\nMy rage felt fueled by his coldness over my pain. I started to say vile things. I broke my phone while speaking to him because he\u2019d told me I was exaggerating or something. He was always so calm and indifferent and it actually made me crazier. I even cut myself with a piece of broken glass that I\u2019d broken in a rage- a few months later realized it was very wrong and messed up. I just hated feeling so much, and the more passive aggressive he was the more aggressive I became. He triggered abandonment issues from my family that I thought I\u2019d escaped. It hurt and I used anger like a drug. He would yawn in such a showy way if I tried talking or expressing something, or actually have a nap while I stood there a mess talking to the walls: this was like a switch for my rage, it came QUICK. Verbal abuse as in every foul word I never felt the need to use before. I wanted to wound him. And it didn\u2019t seem to phase him except he\u2019d say in disgust that I sound cheap. He\u2019d continue to ignore me- and it began to feel like a punishment for my feelings-turned-rage towards him. The confusing part was I felt like I loved him, but I knew we weren\u2019t good together and needed space. \n\nHe borrowed money from me, never paid for groceries or cooked or cleaned up after himself, rarely clipped his toenails or washed his hair, used the same underwear for 3-5 days, kept promises to others never me, he didn\u2019t apologize first or last and always made me seem like I\u2019m overreacting- so I told him I want to be alone because I can\u2019t deal with the highly emotional/confusingly aggressive person I\u2019m becoming- unfortunately he knew all about my life since we\u2019d been friends; he accurately told me my family wouldn\u2019t have me back at their place and he wouldn\u2019t be the one leaving. I flew into rages often over this injustice, the anger preoccupied my mind and made me feel powerful (an illusion I know)- I slapped him. I pushed him. I stamped his feet. I wanted to rip him apart tbh. But a few minutes later of him just standing there, the rage would wear off- and I\u2019d be shocked at my cruelty. I\u2019d never hit anyone before. He seemed genuinely shocked and upset too. I pleaded with him to leave me alone. He refused because \u201che loved me\u201d. I didn\u2019t want to be with him until I\u2019d gotten control of my anger- I started therapy but he still refused to give me space. \n\nHe encouraged my guilt and shame over how abusive I was. I felt betrayed by myself for being a terrible person, I was constantly reading how once abusive always abusive- so began a journey into hating myself for being someone so disgusting. But the more I hated myself, while not being able to have a proper timeout, the more I wanted to hurt him for not caring about me. He seems like the nicest guy, so why couldn\u2019t he care for me? My mum\u2019s words came back to me - no one could love me. I could not deal with that truth and his indifferent presence- I gave into being physically abusive for several months. My episodes were destructive, I didn\u2019t break bones but I caused bruising with my nails and teeth and broke many things - still cringing at the image. I couldn\u2019t understand why he would not just leave me like I used to ask when I was more logical. One day I screamed like the deranged bitch I\u2019d become that he obviously likes it when I lose control because he\u2019s a frigid loser who gets his kicks from whatever punishment he\u2019s inflicting on me- and bam! An angry reaction for once! He began fighting back physically, I thought I was strong during my fits of rage - until one push from him had me bouncing off furniture. He strangled me until I almost passed out. I just lay there because I honestly wanted to die. Therapy was useless because he would be the nicest person: agreeable and rational.. then come home and actually admit he isn\u2019t interested in doing what the counselor asked him to do (sit up, face me, and make eye contact when I wanted to talk - we had identified it as my main rage trigger).\n\nIn the third year I just stopped feeling like physically hurting him. But nothing had changed in his attitude, and I was verbally abusive making no attempts at controlling my disdain for him. I tried and failed at annulling the marriage and obtaining a divorce (religion fail), and even though I wanted some days or weeks to myself he only gave a few hours to me in the middle of an argument because I didn\u2019t want him to leave- I wanted answers and understanding. He left all the time. He\u2019d say being with me is draining- yet he still stayed not caring that I didn\u2019t want to be with him. He was fine never having sex, or doing anything as a couple- being hateful roommates was so agreeable to him. I eventually started antidepressants and it made me pretty complacent but I never lost my verbal abuse, and occasionally I\u2019d push him (in a rude way walking passed him, purposely not out of rage) he hated it - I enjoyed the anger he experienced when I exhibited potential violence. This is sick, but it was the only move I had that made him angry enough to leave.\nEventually I lost interest in goading him, did my own thing being a miserable weirdo, didn\u2019t try talking about improving anything, accepted I\u2019d never be a mother- and two years later he suddenly without any warning- left (most likely because he already began a relationship with someone he met while we were together), found out from his Facebook- he blocked me on Instagram even though I was only relieved he left, never called him in tears- only called to sort out the apartment/paperwork- but he ghosted me- he actually \u201cunliked\u201d all my Instagram posts too, and removed my friends and family from his social media. My sentence was finally over.\n\nSo the abuse: my therapist and psychiatrist never diagnosed me with personality disorders, had ruled out bipolar - the official and ongoing diagnoses is clinical depression and general/social anxiety. But I always wondered because normal people aren\u2019t abusive. After he left my therapist explained about power dynamics and how I didn\u2019t have any - my anger only made him feel more control, and I read about narcissistic people thinking wow my mom/ex husband sound narcissistic- but then, SO DO I (albeit differently).

He drove to visit a few times, I visited once, and then he moved back (where he grew up) to be close to me. During the week I visited him, he, I believe, gaslighted to create what became his main focuses of virtually all our arguments, which he went back to repeatedly. He knew I struggled with alcoholism. After a previous abusive relationship, I got bad enough that I went a month where I had 0-200 calories a day, not counting alcohol. I started making an effort to go back to 1000-1200 cals of healthy eating a day, but continued daily drinking. When I realized I was at a point where I had the sweats &amp; shakes if I wasn't drinking, he was the friend I called, seeking support. He'd overcome alcoholism &amp; substance abuse too, and was one of my best friends. So flash forward, I cut down on my drinking significantly, we're dating, I visit, and we're having some beer. I was feeling nauseous and anxious about being with him, we'd just had our first major fight where I was seeing red flags, manipulation, etc, and he called me a psychopath/manipulator and said I was abusive. He was absorbed in a game we both played and I was trying to be cool with that, and I kept downing beers, too many too fast. I texted my ex that day, saying happy birthday. We'd stayed friends and I used to hit him up as a FWB even though he'd moved away. I stopped doing that when nex and I started talking seriously. Nex asked me who I was texting and grabbed my phone out of my hands, claiming it was ok because I'd looked at his earlier (false). He became enraged and started talking about how toxic my ex was and how I shouldn't be talking to him. He lapsed into silence shortly after, I kept drinking too much, and I blacked out. Next day, nex told me I'd raged about what a piece of shit he was, that I'd said I had my sights set on someone else, and that I drop kicked him in the chest. I believed him at the time, but in hindsight I don't think any of that happened. Going through texts, I noticed \"drop kicked\" became \"punched\", which is what made me realize it was probably gaslighting to set the stage for getting me to quit drinking altogether, and so he could spread the story to people to validate that he was just trying to help me and he was the victim, not me. He also managed to eventually convince me I'd cheated on him with my ex, because I'd kept a FWB while we were dating. He swore he'd compared timelines with my ex and that was the case. What actually happened was I maintained a friendship with the ex, but my ex kept sending nudes to me and trying to get me to send them, and I rejected him and tried to keep things platonic. Since ex didn't respect that I was in a relationship, I listened to nex when he said I should dead my ex. I said even if I did nex would never let up on what happened and it would haunt us. It was a general assessment of human nature, and I was right. I didn't talk to my ex again until way later when I was trying to figure out if nex had lied about certain things ex said to alter my perceptions of the ex &amp; validate his claim that I'd cheated on him and was a liar and a manipulator. Even after I stopped talking to my ex, nex continued talking to him, to the point of harassment, to use him to fact check me and for validation.

I started thinking about how crazy that is for me to be able to say that after the way my life started out and I realized that yes, I got very lucky when I met my husband and had my daughter. Some things in life are purely luck and coincidence and originate from the goodness in others - and I am not trying to downplay just how lucky I am to have my healthy and happy family. I don't think I could have gotten here if I hadn't started with choices I made over 10 years ago.\n\nThe danger of abusive people isn't that they will hurt you. The danger comes from carrying their voice with you, inside of yourself. If you keep toxic people in your life, you carry around their voices and your idea of yourself changes - it is influenced by their idea of who you are.\n\nWhen you meet new negative voices, even those of strangers, they match the voices of the people you love, making them easier to believe than they should be. The cruel people you encounter even briefly become easier to trust and to believe. You accept new, toxic people into your life because the abuse has become your norm - the narrative is familiar and oddly comfortable. You've set the bar low for yourself and you've created an entire framework of \"reality\" and what you deserve.\n\nWhen I first left home I kept in contact with some people I really shouldn't have because I believed that being a good daughter / sister / friend / person meant I needed to forgive them and keep them in my life in the hopes they could change. I didn't want to leave them alone and, on some level, I was afraid of being alone. I gradually realized that some people are like poison, and the longer I didn't cut them out of my life they were poisoning me.\n\nKeeping toxic people in your life does not help them. Giving them a person to abuse or manipulate actually harms them and reinforces their behavior. Staying does not help them get better. In my experience, even waking up totally alone does not help an abusive person realize the things they've done. Beyond that, you are harming yourself and limiting your future happiness.\n\nAfter I freed myself from these toxic people, it became so much easier to spot the people who did not mean well for me. It was easier to see the red flags. To not tolerate disrespect or inconsideration. To stand up for myself and to walk away before I became involved with the wrong people.\n\nDistance yourself now, and the further you get down the road, the better friendships and relationships will naturally blossom in your life. Once you can recognize the weeds in your garden, you can pull them as soon as they start to grow. You can have a beautiful rose garden, but it starts with clearing out the brambles.\n\nIt's been said by so many, but surround yourself with positive people. Accept constructive criticism, but if you find yourself saying over and over \"I can't believe they'd do that\" or \"I can't believe they'd say something so hurtful\", then you better start to believe it. Recognize the pattern and separate yourself from that person.\n\nYou do not owe anyone your happiness - but you do owe you future self the years of freedom from abuse you need to believe good things about yourself. No, you cannot completely forget the things that have been done to you, but you can stop repeating them to yourself and you can stop believing that you deserved it. \n\nI wanted to post this because I wish someone could have shown me a crystal ball when I was a teenager. I wish someone could have shown me the family I have now. I wish I could have known how happy I could be and how much better I could feel.\n\nIf you're reading this and there are people you need to distance yourself from, just know that it gets better and you will be a better you without them. Take small steps to distance yourself from the toxic people who have hurt you or are hurting you, and before you know it, you will be far off in the distance down your own path.

If allowed, I will post more stories on here, due to the fact I have plenty to prove my case. \n\nThis one, is called Adoption Is An Option. Please, share this story. I want abuse victims to know they aren't alone. This is, by far, one of the more... relaxed abuse I endured from this boy. For, he is no man if he is so insecure he has to put his own wife and children below his thumb.\n\n____\n\nIn 7th grade, I was going through an emo phase. I was twelve years old and going through a case that involved me not consenting to sex to a blood-related family member. Some might find this as their perverse \"wet dream\" but to me, and many others, this was sickening that someone went against what a child wanted, and not only took their virginity, but also any respect their family had for them and the child.\n\nIt roughly went on for a year before I decided to speak out. My parents blamed themselves for it going under their nose and tried to give me treatment. I refused, thinking I could do this on my own.\n\nUnlike many rape victims, I didn't see myself as dirty. I saw myself as a survivor, and I personally wanted to kill my family member who did that to me. \n\nFor my own sanity, and the person's safety, I moved three hours away from home. They were not given an address, nor were anyone else. \n\nWe moved in with my grandparents. They have raised me in the past. From infancy until four, maybe five years old. I have fond memories of that time, however, from then on out, they grew quite wicked.\n\nAlthough this happened years ago, it was a marking point in my life, and despite how hard I try to tell everyone, it was indeed traumatic for me. I have had many traumatic experiences. Most being verbal abuse, some others sadly being physical.\n\nIt happened not too long before my grandfather on my father's side passed. We were living with my mother's parents, and we couldn't sadly visit him one last time before he passed. The Child Protective Services had stated that until we [Rapist and victim] both got the help we needed, we shouldn't be in the same vicinity as the other. \n\nMy father blamed me for the \"event\" that transpired between the family member and I. I was the stronger one. I was the more intelligent one. I was sadly, the elder one. When I tried to explain the hold he had on me, it was met with pure ignorance. I eventually, blamed my father for my downwards spiral.\n\nHow dare he blame this on me?? Does he not understand that I am now considered filthy to many family members now?? Does he not understand that I could have gotten pregnant? Or the fear of it?? Does he not know the anxiety and paranioa that not only keeps me awake at ungodly hours of the ling night, but also the same crippling, barbwire terror that causes me to lose my breath and hope I'm not having a heart attack? The same fucking terror thag causes me to look over my shoulder?! \n\nNo. He could not, for he was not in the same position I was. So how dare he???\n\nOur relationship grew from strained to highly abusive. It grew to the point I could not even stay in the same room as the sperm donor [father]. It grew to the point I told my therapist that if it wasn't illegal, or a sin, I'd kill the man myself; And in the most cruelest of ways imaginable. To vent my anger and bloodlust, I told the therapist exactly what I would do, in great detail. \n\nNot only did it disturb the therapist, it greatly disturbed and sickened me. To myself, I was just as bad as Jeffery Dahmer or Jack The Ripper!!! I was sick in the head and heart!! The therapist asked if I believed in God, and I told him, at the time, no. There was no God. (An action now I heavily regret.)\n\nThe therapist told me to listen to certain types of music, and in that little office, sprouted not only a saving grace, but also my love for everything Three Days Grace. \n\nDue to their music, my bloodlust was accurately executed; Their music screamed what I was as a person, and what my family [Father and Rapist] had done to me. To this day, my favorite song is Home.\n\nI left that therapy session cleansed. No bloodlust at all, and overtime I grew into Heavy Metal, Hard Rock and the \"Emo\" music itself. It channelled the bloodlust into something manageable. I could scream out my hate and cry my heart out with the lyrics and no one would judge. It was an outlet, an amazing source of relief. \n\nMy grand father had passed, and with that the abusive relationship grew darker. \n\nI don't know what had exactly transpired between us, but it left me in my grandmother's arms, holding me back, and my mother holding my father back.\n\nVenemously, I shall never forget what that bastard told me. \"You were a mistake, ----!!!!\" He spat in my face, my mother scrunched up between us. I remember he lowered his head to peer into my eyes, his hazel orbs somehow swimming in white-hot hatred. I remember being deathly afraid for my life when he shoved my mother off of him, shook my grandmother off me and bunched his fist into my t-shirt.\n\nHe told me, he should have put me up for adoption like I was a useless, blind, guard dog. We were shocked. I remember telling him that it that wasn't the worst thing he'd tell me, and I proceeded to tell him if he was going to kill me, to do it already. That I didn't give a damn because at least I'd get to see him rot in Hell.\n\nHe stormed off, dropping me on the concrete when my grandfather came home.\n\nTo me, it was too late. I resented myself for saying that, for letting him do that to me. I promised to be stronger, but I failed myself.\n\nHe came back and my mother welcomed him in with open arms, but from then on, we'd hate each other and sneer whenever we got the chance. I'm sure if neither of us were held back by God himself, we'd have already killed each other.\n\nThat was my third traumatic experience with this man, and certaintly not my last.\n\n____\n\nAuthor's Note: \n\nI am perfectly fine. \nI have gotten therapy for my mental state and for the traumatic experiences that had occured multiple times throughout my life. I am a strong, capable adult with no bloodlust at all. We [the therapist and I] chalked it up to the simple, elegant response of: I was a child and had major anger issues and didn't understand feelings. ((Yes, BNHA fans, I was a real life Bakugou Katsuki, without the blond hair, red eyes, and with horrible traumatic experiences.)) \n\nCurrent relationship with my father? \nHe's the only person I dislike in my family. The only \"Ill-will\" I have towards the man is that my mother leaves him. He's a snake, a sly fox who will soon, hopefully become exposed for his true colors.\n\nThe rapist and I have gotten a normal, healthy relationship established and have blocked those memories from our mind. \nWe occasionally go to therapy if we have a problem with those horrid memories, and work them out together. I, and my family, did not press charges against him. I am a hard working adult, who in my family's eyes, have become a worthy person. ((No we aren't Asian, we are very much American. It's just that I dishonored my family by being so weak.)) \n\nCurrent relationship with my mother? \nShe's still with my father. She doesn't leave him, and quite frankly I think she's forced to stay. Or maybe she needs therapy herself because if she's staying on her own will, without threats, she's as insane as I once was. I hope in due time, she'll see the snake he is and leave him to rot in Hell, but only time will tell.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It's so mindblowing because I feel like I've become an almost entirely different person as a result of having to heal myself from my ex's abuse. I've developed some sense of self, self-respect, self-esteem, self-love. I know how to set boundaries and that I don't owe anything to anyone no matter what they've done for me or the history I have with that person.   \nSoon after I ended the relationship with my ex, I started to educate myself about narcissistic abuse and that was what completely broke me away from ever wanting a relationship with him again. Once you realize that it's all just a game for these people and that it really wasn't a true relationship all along, that's it. There's no more missing the days when he was \"Prince Charming\", because I now realize that his over abundance of love, gifts, and rushing into a very serious and passionate relationship within the first three weeks of meeting me were screaming red flags. I now understand that when he took my attempts to have a healthy conversation about how he should treat me and why he can't do certain things to me and spun them around to make me look ungrateful, uncaring, and not willing to understand \"what he was going through\" was just a form of manipulation and gaslighting. And let me tell you, spending months alone with a person who makes you reevaluate your own memories, opinions, boundaries, and sense of self is a HELL of a drug and the adjustment back to reality is a difficult one.\n\nIt's actually really hard for me now, as a person who respects myself and now knows that it was all just a sick power game for him to look back on all the things I was coerced and shamed into doing for him. Some of it is so disgusting I really don't want to tell anyone else about it. Everything was always my fault. If he hit me, yelled at me, ignored me, mistreated me, or screwed me over in any way, it was because he had to \"punish me\" for something I did wrong, which was usually something atrocious like accepting an extra shift at work or not giving him access to my bank account. It astounds me that I allowed that to happen to myself. And it saddens me too. Looking back on it I feel like I'm remembering a little girl getting beaten around by someone much more powerful, not as if I'm remembering myself going through it, because I would never let that happen to me again. (Not victim blaming in any way as there are many reasons people get into these types of relationships and get stuck in them. But I do know that during the relationship my self-esteem was at rock bottom and only got worse with him. Nothing got better until I broke away from him and was able to develop my own self worth. Only then did I have the strength to never go back. If I discovered that strength a lot sooner, I wouldn't have been with him for over a year.) \n\nA month into our relationship he got angry and choked me out because I accepted an extra shift at work on a day he wanted to hang out. He convinced me to have sex afterwards because \"if I wasn't going to see him for another week I had to make it up to him somehow\". I \"loaned\" him hundreds of dollars because he was homeless at one point and found a super cheap apartment that he just didn't have quite enough for, so clearly since I had the money it would then be *my* fault if he didn't get the apartment. That was the type of thinking and rationalizing he used against me. I was an idiot, I know. But I hated every bit of myself and just wanted *someone*. What I didn't realize was that he was the tumor on my life that was turning me bitter, and it was turning all the healthy people in my life away from me. Now that I'm okay with myself inside, the outside world is becoming a lot easier too. \n\nSomething that disturbs me the most, however, is that I don't think I ever really got to love him. But I sure fell in love with the idea of him and the magical, dream-like relationship he promised me we had, just that \"things were tough right now and he was working hard to make everything right, just that he couldn't do it alone so it was basically on me to fix everything\". You know, because he was clearly the victim of this situation. But I have a distinct memory, a few weeks into our relationship, where I started to realize that he really rushed me into dating him and that I hadn't had enough time to actually get to know him to even like him like that. Meanwhile, he was talking about getting me to meet his family and I just wasn't feeling it. Then the choking incident happened, we broke up, he became homeless, and begged me, as the only person in his life, to help him. I do not know why I continued to help someone who could have killed me for over a year after that, but I did and I want to hate myself for it. But it's just not me anymore. \n\nI feel so ashamed and disappointed in myself for being okay with someone treating me like that. I feel so stupid and gullible, and telling people about it only reinforces those feelings, because I can tell they think I'm stupid too. I wish I had an answer to give them, and myself, about why I let that happen but I don't have any good ones. Things are starting to become better for me and I'm finally focusing on the important things in my life. But all I can think about sometimes is where I might be today if I spent that year and half loving myself as much as I loved him. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

You told me, choose me, show me you love me. Show me it is us versus the world. And so I did. I choose you. I lost so many friends, I stopped talking to my family for you. And you used to complained how we never hung out with my friends. It\u2019s because I lost most of them because of you. I moved to this city for you. So yes, she does have more friends than I. \n\nThe reason I gained weight - after the car accident, I couldn\u2019t run or bike anymore. After the miscarriage which you caused, I was devastated. I have been in a huge depression and I asked you to help me. I did eat healthy but losing the weight is not a fast thing without exercise. So yes, she is thinner than I. \n\nWhen you said I was selfish and only cared about myself- it hurt so much. I turned down 3 job offers so that I could stay in the city. Yes, my choice but did you not say \u201cwhat kind of partners would we be if we live in different cities\u201d. I wanted to show you that I was a partner. That I was worth you telling me I was your partner. When we didn\u2019t have much money, I often said I spent hungry or full so that you could eat more. When you didn\u2019t have money for rent, didn\u2019t I take a crappy job so that I could help you pay for rent. Didn\u2019t I say, my money is your money?  When you needed money for groceries, your bills, your car and insurance payment, didn\u2019t I give you money without even thinking about it twice?? When your mom needed money, didn\u2019t I give you guys money. So yes, when you screamed that I was selfish, I did tell you how can you say that when I help you. I remember being hungry at night but wouldn\u2019t say anything because I wanted you to eat more. I literally took food from my mouth to feed you. I lost on job opportunities for you, you knew how desperate I was for a real job and you kept saying that if I took it I would not be a real partner. \n\nWhen you called me arrogant- how can you say that. I ate and swallowed my pride in every argument. No maid I thought I was wrong or right. No matter if you called me a worthless bitch, I nonetheless tried to sit down and talk to you about the issue. I said sorry every argument. Remember when you called me a worthless bitch, kicked me out of our apartment and then I asked you, if you really meant your words and you looked up and said yes. Then, I began crying and you got up and said, I\u2019m going to do uber, make a plan to do something and celebrate my birthday. I saw you walking away without regard for what you called me and still asked me to do something for your birthday. And like an idiot I did plan something. I did buy you wrap your gift I had in the garage. I did plan. And when you came back and said \u201cagain with the sour face\u201d and I said \u201cI\u2019m trying, I\u2019ll be ok\u201d but I started to cry and what did you tell me \u201cthere you go again. Always the victim. You are sad I called you a bitch, think you acted like on, but you don\u2019t see it\u2019s your fault. How are you going to shoot your foot and then cry about it\u201d. And that just hurt more. And I started to cry again. And you said, I don\u2019t want to deal with you, and you just walked away. I stupidly felt so bad it was your birthday and the way we were. I begged you to do something so your day wouldn\u2019t be \u201cruined\u201d. Not every argument was my fault. Why did I have to say sorry every time? Oh right, because otherwise, you would not talk to me. Because then you treated me as if I was invisible. You know how horrible it feels to be in the same apartment and feel alone. You gave yourself days to cool down. But no matter what you said to me, I had to get over things as soon as you said \u201ccome on over it. \n\nTelling me I was nagging and immature - you told me I was nagging bc I asked you to spend quality time with me. So to spend more time with you, i began to watch sports with you. I learned about basketball because of you. So that you could spend time with me. You called me annoying and nagging when I asked to not be on your phone while we hung out watching whatever show you wanted. And you yelled at me that \u201cif I fucking want to be on my phone, I will be on it. Fuck you. If you don\u2019t like it don\u2019t fucking watch shit with me\u201d. But I was so desperate for your company. You called me nagging when I asked you to hold my hand when we watched shows. You said i complained to much and said I was immature. Looking back, I realized how desperate I was for your affection outside sex. \n\nWhen you cursed ant me and screamed at the top of your lungs you would say that it is normal. It\u2019s not normal to scream and have the neighbors ask me if I\u2019m ok. It\u2019s not normal to raise your tone for every little argument. It\u2019s not ok to say, if you don\u2019t like it get the fuck out of here. THAT APARTMENT WAS MINE TOO PAID RENT TOO. I HELPED PAY EVERYTHING IN THERE. SO WHY AM I ALWAYS BEING KCKMED OUT. WHERE DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO. \n\nCALLING ME A WORTHLESS BITCH- for years that was your go to phrase. That was your insult of choice. That seed you implanted in my head grew and grew. You made feel like no matter what I did for you, I was not good enough. I was never perfect, but I tried so hard to work on myself. I tried to always see your point of view. Didn\u2019t I tell you, I don\u2019t see things you do, but if you help me understand how and why it hurt you, I can learn from my mistakes. \n\nYou hurt me so much. Not only did you treat me like I was trash to you. You actually moved on with the one girl you jokingly called \u201cmy girl friend\u201d. What kind of engaged 36 years old calls his friend that. You asked me to trust you, that\u2019s I was just crazy, but look, look where you are now. I guess I wasn\u2019t crazy. Only 3 weeks after I walked away. \n\nYou hurt me beyond belief. You monster. \n\n\nNote - didn\u2019t send it. But I just needed to say this to someone. Sorry it\u2019s so long. \n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

If I start an argument and tell her how I feel and go distant no matter how she reacts, I fear she won't get the message and wouldn't learn the lesson, because all that matters to her is her bf, because she is dependent on him. It propably would still have been effective in Phase2. If I do nothing and give her the closeness she needs she will do it again earlier or later.**\n\nRight now I choosed the later, because she is sick and that is more important than an argument, but I wonder how I should react next time?\n\nI am happy this sub exists for a topic like this, and I am thankful that didn't need your help in a while now.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Can I be loved?", "author": "pillowofdark", "self_text": "Tried to get me to see him, to events, to hang out. After six months, I did it. On Christmas. He texted me. He kept texting me. Didn't say he didn't want me to put theofficial notice on FB, but simply didn't want me to put it there himself, his labmates would make fun of him. I was out of his league, I was so beautiful. We had our nights together, his friends became mine, everyone knew. We were a thing. We went on a trip, trips with his friends, so many of them. We were a part of each other's lives everywhere. He helped me get into hiking, snowboarding. We were so close, it was clear for anyone to see. We had weekly movie nights and potlucks at a friends house - we saw 5 seasons of Game of Thrones in 2 months, we'd go back home together, we'd leave together. He was devastated when I broke up, even though his only answer to my requests to talk and listen to how neglected I'd been feeling was \"I don't know what to say\". He wouldn't talk, he wouldn't want to propose dates, he'd be cold and distant. Once he said he had been taking me for granted, and he won't do it anymore. But he did. And three months later the hurt was too much. Then he came to talk once. \"I haven't been happy for a month. I don't think I laughed.\" I cried. I missed him. We'd been going to sleep in each other's arms and found so much comfort there. He'd cook my favorite food. Then he came to talk the second time, and I broke down. We kissed and made love three times without saying anything. And I said how right this feels. And he agreed. And he talked about how he felt. And I thought, this is real. I was gone and he wanted me. We'll talk now. We'll fix things. It's real.\n\nIt all went away soon enough. And then, \"I wish I could absorb you...\" Longingly, after being apart for a month, but not being bothered to want to talk during that time. Being bored as ever after a few days. It all returned. And I ended it again. \"You are important. Just not as important as you'd like to be,\" he said to me on that night. And I just wanted closure. \"Thank you for the message. I was never going for a serious relationship to begin with. I just didn't want to disappoint you and you were so into it. I just went along. I thought I was committed because I could have cheated, or left you to chase for someone else, and there were temptations, but didn't.\" Telling me how he couldn't flirt with a nice girl he met because of us, when I tried to talk to him one last time, push it all inside and somehow not be enemies. Saying how it plagued him that I had dated a common friend for two months a long time ago I had no contact with anymore, despite him resenting me for hating on his desire to be close friends with an ex and disappear during parties with her. Then seeing him and the new girl in our group flirt, in the same friend group we helped establish and grow, but she was really nice and pretty, and there for me when I had my mental breakdowns. But to find out how he sold me to the friend whose place we watched GoT at, so he could get her, that was next level. \"You want OP? Cuz I want the other girl.\"\n\nAnd ultimately, when leaving the country a few months after, \"I realize we're not getting back together, in that sense I've moved on. But in the sense I still have feelings for you, I have not. I hope to connect. We didn't end well, but I hope we can look at our memories in a positive way someday.\"\n\nHow much of a thing was I. How can something feel so real and then throw me away like trash. How can everything I was, everything we had, everything I gave, all the feelings we exchanged and been through mean nothing compared to a new pretty girl. Why was that ok. Why was that fun. Why did I not mean anything, at my very best, giving all I had, for so long. How can you have feelings for me, abruptly stand up when you think I'm crying, and look at me and then want to fuck someone else.\n\nHow can I look my new lover whom I adore, who is 100 times the man the nex was, and ever feel worthy enough. When despite everything on every level, just the chance of someone pretty and charismatic erased everything I took so long to build.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This weekend for example I heard her say our 11 year old might not be able to complete in a tournament because she might not be able to make it to watch him. When I talked to her about it later she says that she never said that and actually said she would have to changer her plans. She made feel like I was crazy because her kids always come first. \n\nShe will go out every weekend for 4-8 hours a night and act like it is her right as a women to go out and have fun. She gets mad if I ask her what is going on or if she minds if I do some thing with the kids. \n\nThe only thing that is different than most narcs I see posted on this sub is how my wife handles relationship conflicts. If I bring up any current or past problems in our relationship she has 2 default replies. 1) I know it is all my fault leave me a lone or 2) let me know when I do something right. Both of these hurt me because I never said she did anything wrong I am just look to work through a problem. She has never wanted to work on any problems we may have she just wants to act like nothing happened. Or if I do not let it go because I need some kind of resolution to the problem she gets physical with me. I have been punched, kicked, scratched or bitten. When ever I tell her that it hurts she just blames it on me not letting the problem go. \n\nNow she tells me she has never been happy with me and she is done. She does not know what she wants she just know she is tired of me making her feel like everything is her fault. \n\nI am not sure if she is a narc so if anyone reading this can help that would be nice.

I am living in a family of 4 people or was since my parents are living apart, but are still really close. And to cut to the chase of this subreddit, my family is pretty emotionally abusive. Not all of them, mainly my mother and my younger brother. I also have an elder half brother, but he is way older than me and didn't really live with us. My little brother being younger doesn't really mean anything since he is only 1,5 year apart from me and I'm not really the type of person to argue with anything else than words.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was always some kind of \"punching bag\" for my mother and brother. They often did things like calling me names when something happened,  often refusing to use my real name for weeks. Looking back it sounds really childish and nonsevere, but it often took a hard hit on me because, especially as a child, you value what the ones closest to you think about you. My mother would even often hit me for doing something wrong, not only me but all of her kids, which took a hard turn on everyone. She stopped after a while but only because we grew too big and are capable of stopping her when she is trying to attack us. And as a bonus to that, my mother was really entitled about herself, which resulted in me not being allowed to have any friends she didn't like or which parents she didn't like. This all resulted in me hardly having any friends I was really close to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to my brother. I was always considered to be the creative but lazy child and he was considered to be the more ambitious one. Despite my mother praising me for my creativity, she laid more value in being ambitious, since that's what allows you to get the job you want and a good continues education at uni. Therefore she praised my brother and even benefitted him more than me. This resulted in him starting to believe that he is automatically better than me at anything he does, which obviously cannot be true. For example, we did some sailing in the family and my brother was a lot worse than me. But despite me being the better sailor, when we were sailing together he kept insisting on me doing all the mistakes and him doing everything perfectly. Until I said \"Fuck it, you are skipper now. Now get us home.\". This obviously didn't work out since he laked the skills and knowledge to do so. But he still kept believing for quite the while he was a god at everything he touches compared to me and treated me like dirt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSkip forward a few years. I've become that edgy kid at school, who everyone knows and always wears hoodies without the hood and has long messy hair. Of course I got bullied for quite some time in school, but it didn't take such a hard hit on me since I was kinda used to it. I was pretty good in science stuff but wasn't really interested in good grades since they had no real value to me. In the last to years I was in school I got to know some good friends and I just kept ignoring most things my mother said to me about, well most things. I finished school and told my girlfriend at the time and my closest friends about my problems to some extent, but since I have huge trust issues regarding my inner thought to other people up today I never told them the whole story.  They often said it's impressive that I grew to be such a \"normal\" person despite what has happened to me. And they gave me hope, that when I would finish school I could finally get my oppressive mother off my back, which I believed, but what a fool I was. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShortly after school finishing school, my girlfriend broke up with on good terms. Shortly after there was the official handing over of our final \"grades\" (i guess) and everybody from school was there. My mother tried to make friendly conversation to my ex gf's mother when I wasn't there, or at least I thought she would. My ex talked to me a bit later how my mother kinda hinted at us getting back together since \"relationships like that are just child's play\" (at the age of 17!) and the parents \"should handle this\". My ex knew this wasn't coming from me and warned me about my mothers doing, which made me completely lose my temper. I'm really a person who hardly gets angry about anything. But this. This made me go really angry. I shouted at my mother for 2 hours trying to explain to her what an insane idiot she is, how she could A: Disrespect me and my opinion on this (She didn't ask me how I feel about her even talking to them) and B: Disrespect my Ex about her own decision about who to be together with and who not. The problem with insane people is, they tend to not reflect about their own insanity and I just shouted at a brick wall for 2 hours straight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSkip to two weeks today. I'm at the end of my first semester in university studying mathematics. My original plan was to work for a year or two and then start studying. But my mother wouldn't have that. She worked at the University for a long time and believed that studying at uni was \"the only way to great jobs\". It might be, but I still think it's a person's right to decide his own future, even if it might get him a low waged job. If you are happy working at McDonald's, go for it. It's your life and your decisions and its nobody's right to stop you. But that didn't stop my mother from pulling all strings and tricks she knew to not make me go my way, but hers. She wanted me to study informatics, which I hate, so I chose to go for math instead. I got a well-paid job as student-assistant which I really enjoy and studying worked flawlessly. Then I had to study for my exams. From my school history, one could think that I wouldn't take this seriously, but I do so far, as I am studying to pass the semester and nothing more. I made up my study plan and everything was going fine until I wanted to go to work. My mother insisted on me not going there since I had to study. But I didn't care about her ideas of properly studying. She then called my dad (who is still pretty close to the entire family) and tried to get him to pressure me into not going to work. He refused to because he trusts me with my own responsibilities. When that didn't work my mother wanted me to immediately move out since I'm not welcome in this house anymore. I just shook my head laughing because this wasn't the first time she wanted me to move out because of me \"disobeying\" her. Then she wanted to call the company I work at to immediately fire me because she didn't sign any papers that allow me to work there (she didn't have to, my father did) and then googled the company, not being able to spell the name correctly. Then she wanted to sue them for taking advantage of a minor and abusing my work power. At this point, I just left the house because I already was too late for work and couldn't care less about her shouting senseless threads. When I got home, the wifi was gone, which I needed to access the files from my lectures which I use to study. She just replied with: \"Obviously you don't want to study.\". I think it's fairly obvious at this point that this wasn't about me studying or not, it was about her getting her will or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now we are at today. Nothing really special happened, I just felt the courage to write this.\n\nThose where just some examples from things that happened to me, but they are perfectly describing the general problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut where are the confusing points I talked about in the beginning? Thanks at first to anyone who made it this far, I really appreciate it.\n\nWell here is the thing. Let us start with my brother because he has the shortest aftermath:\n\nWhen he was roughly in 9th grade he started to realize that his whole pride was constructed on lies told by his mother. He then proceeded to hate and ignore her far more than I probably will in my entire life. He refused to talk to anybody in our family and was going through a pretty rough phase. He started to shape up again in the last two years, but he still has strong self-worth issues and social anxiety. He might have been a bully to me, but I still cared for him since my mother took her hits on him as well. He still flinches when he is arguing with her and she makes a fast movement towards his face.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow to my mother:\n\nI have to admit, she is probably more villain then anybody in this story. She was and still is a huge source of violence and negativity to people around her. But here is the problem: She still loves her family. It is one of the most important things in her life and most of her actions towards us are motivated from caring about me and my brother. But the problem is, she always lacked the patience to do so correctly. And her insane ego-centric vision on the world resulted in her to lose focus on her intention to help me in life. As I described above, she is more than willing to ruin my entire life just to get her will done but luckily she lacks the focus and determination to do so correctly. She even recently lost her job and is now shifting from taking it out on me and regretting her entire life. And regardless of what a person did, I try to help her out emotionally as best as I can, even though she sometimes thinks I owe her that emotional assistance since she is my mother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd last but not least: Me\n\nIt's a hard thing to reflect about myself since it's myself who is doing the reflection, but a few months ago I had a conversation with my elder half brother who was having a garden party at our house. I was working at the PC when he came into my room and wanted to hug me because he was obviously drunk. I hugged him and then he started talking about how my hugs lack... heart. I was confused because I wouldn't say I'm a heartless person. I care about everybody, even people I hate or just saw on the street. But then he explained to me how I always was a really emotional kid and that I stopped being that some time ago. How he noticed how I kept hiding my emotions to everyone and putting everybody else's needs first instead of myself. I am still constantly switching between excessively caring about everybody and everything and not caring about anything at all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis results in the main problem of my story: I don't know what to do.\n\nI could forgive everyone for what the have done to me and just keep caring or I could stop. This conflict has made me quite some trouble for quite some years now and I still can't find an answer. But since I am turning 18 in April, I have no excuse why I could continue delaying my decision. My father, my brother and I have enough family memories to tell a judge to get my mother in prison of child abuse. I on my behalf have the option to walk away from all of them completely and never speak to them again soon. Making use of complete independence which I gain in a few months. Or I could do something else. And I don't know what.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was my story and I hope that you can help me make up my mind.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAdam", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I was in my first real relationship with a guy from high school for almost 4 years. 2 years were a 4 hour long distance relationship. In our small town of people(pop. 12,000) he was everyone\u2019s favorite person and everyone from there had amazing things to say. On the contrary, multiple people I met in college were shaken by my relationship with him and how he behaved towards me. One of the things that came up alarming to my roommate was that he constantly blew up my phone with text messages and would call me after 10minutes wondering what was wrong, if I was safe because I wasn\u2019t texting him back. I started working and he had it marked down to the minute of when I got off of work. If I didn\u2019t text him within 10 minutes he\u2019d ask what I was doing, where I was, who I was with... all under the pretense of wondering if I was okay.  When I first moved into my dorm he looked through my clothes and belongings to see what I would be wearing around campus. The dorms at my college had awful reception, so calls often dropped. If I were on the phone with him, he would often freak out when the call dropped and accuse me of being sneaky and cheating on him..there were more things like deleting phone #s on my phone, talking bad about my friends and trying to get me to end friendships because they were \u201cwhores and sluts\u201d so I shouldn\u2019t surround myself around them, yelling at other guys standing behind me at McDonald\u2019s for \u201clooking at me too long\u201d... we were at an amusement park and he got in a verbal altercation and grabbed me by my ass because apparently some guy \u201cwas checking out his woman and he needed to know I was taken\u201d \n\nMy breaking point was when I would come over to his apartment there would never be any food available except for canned chicken and saltine crackers, but he would be offended if I brought my own groceries to eat while I visited him he would get offended because he as the man should be providing. He would hate going out to eat anywhereeeee because it was a waste of his money, but at the same time if I wanted to pay it wasn\u2019t allowed. So unless he could pay we wouldn\u2019t eat. He lived in a gated apartment community, so while he left for work I couldn\u2019t leave because I had no way to get back in and he would never provide me with a key because \u201cI had no reason to leave\u201d. \n\n\nStill with all of this I struggle with blaming myself for all of it. There were multiple times where I said we were breaking up, but I went back because his family and friends contacted me and would tell me over and over the mistake I was making because he was such a nice and amazing guy that I wasn\u2019t thinking properly and should reconsider what good relationship I was ruining. His friends would tell me I was overreacting and I have no reason to want to break up because it was over nothing. \n\nIn ways I feel like I was never abused it couldn\u2019t have been abuse because I was the one with the car and I made the conscious decision to drive 4 hours almost every weekend to go see him.  I put myself in that position, maybe if I didn\u2019t start arguments he wouldn\u2019t have gotten upset. Maybe if I didn\u2019t complain about schoolwork when he came home from working 12 hours of labor it wouldn\u2019t have set him off.  He also said he loved me and just wanted to protect me. We were teenagers to our early 20s at the time so I find it hard to understand how could he have a concept of manipulation and taking advantage of me, maybe he wasn\u2019t doing it on purpose and didn\u2019t realize what he was doing. Can I fault someone for that? Everyone else thought he was a great person, his family seemed nice, so maybe I was just making things up maybe he was right and talking to other guys is disrespectful to your partner. \n\nTL;DR In a long distance relationship with someone who treated me poorly, but I blame myself for it because I made the effort to drive 4 hours to see him every weekend and everyone else thought he was an amazing person.

I did it without any warning and without telling him.

I did not respond to any of it. Nor did I call or text any of the 3rd parties back and I blocked all the numbers. In his last email to me he said he got the hint and would no longer bother me.

I had no idea what that meant, so I did a bit of research and it turns out my ex fits the description of a narc down to a T and I was indeed being hoovered. \n\nHere\u2019s a little back story on our relationship. We started dating 5 years ago. Our relationship started out on such highs. We lived on opposite coasts so we would visit each other frequently. The long distance thing seemed to be working for us. We had the best times together. We adored each other and were so happy at first. Things moved pretty quickly and we were already talking about the future. He would tell me he wanted to marry me and that I was the one. I met his family and was even contemplating moving to be with him, all within a few months of dating. \n\nAs a few months passed he adored me less and we would frequently get into fights about me going out with my friends. Did he expect me to stop living? He would get angry and belittle me for wanting to have a social life. He got jealous if I would hang out with male friends. Things started to go sour and gaslighting became a regular thing. I found myself not going out and doing certain things in order to not make him mad. I wanted us to work out despite all the recent drama. It had been months since I\u2019ve gone out with my friends and decided to because it was a close gf\u2019s birthday. That night he called me around midnight when I was just getting home. He was furious with me, I\u2019m almost positive he had been using coke because I could tell by the tone of voice, aggressive nature and his extreme paranoia. He made me FaceTime him because he didn\u2019t believe I was home. Then he started screaming at me that he saw a guy in the background, which he totally fabricated in his mind, I was home alone in my room. He flipped out on me, called me a drunk slut and every other name in the book. Beyond upset, I hung up on him. How dare he accuse me of cheating? I did nothing wrong. I went to bed and woke up to 1000 missed calls and 5758593 text messages. He texted me paragraph after paragraph blaming me for ruining the relationship and that he knew I would. He also decided to express how ugly I was and made fun of every aspect of my appearance, he made a million derogatory remarks, told me I was inferior to him and how unintelligent I was, even said I was just another girl he could stick his dick in and pretty much said he was using me the whole time and that I was nothing compared to his past gfs. That same night he had a threesome out of spite with two girls (19 &amp; 22) and said they were younger, hotter and smarter than me. He videoed it and texted it to me so I could see and also emailed me photos after I blocked his number. It was beyond hurtful. I\u2019ve never felt such heartache. How could he do such a thing? I blocked his number and all social media and we had no contact after that. \n\nFast forward five years and he gets a new number and contacts me out of the blue and the hoovering begins. He wrote me a long message apologizing for his past actions and that he regretted ever hurting me. He claims he is a new person and has grown up since and mentioned he\u2019s dated around and that no one has ever compared to me. I know I should not have responded but I had so much to say and I never really got closure from our breakup. \n\nWe started chatting more frequently and he\u2019s constantly lovebombing me, telling me he misses me and that I should come visit him. He is constantly reminded me of the good times we had together. I hate that he knows exactly what to say to win me over. He is my kryptonite. The things he says are sweet nothings and I know they are not real, yet I feel enticed. I know he is not capable of having a normal, healthy, loving relationship so why do I even entertain the idea of getting back with him? What is wrong with me? I\u2019m falling for him again and I feel so unbelievably pathetic.\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When I pose a certain way, smile a certain way, SHE DOES TOO. He even bought her the same necklace I own...  If I wear a certain outfit - literally according to the time stamps, she will post the exact same outfit a week later. I am just confused.. and don't understand. If I post a photo of me with my current partner, so will they. It's just STRANGE!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I went NC straight after escaping the relationship - instantly my Nex started to harass me online. I have had to block 10 online profiles that all belong to him, and this behaviour continued well into over a year of being NC. Even though he was in a brand new relationship. I had to recently privatize my social media. He also reached out to me on one of his fake profiles, and became angry because I spoke to one of his friends and completely ignored him for a year +. He reacted - by competing wirh me. Not sure why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat's with the copy cat behaviour? Why does the new partner not see what is happening? It's very scary.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He started sleeping with her in May. I knew in my gut that there was something going on (I'm not a naturally jealous person, so I took this feeling seriously), and he continued to deny any involvement. He would tell me that he was with her overnight, but they were \"just friends.\" They texted constantly. He \"wasn't interested.\" He recruited her to be in videos he was making. She \"wasn't his type.\" Right. He'd go dark for hours on the weekend, never responding to my messages. I knew he was with her, and he wouldn't deny it, but he would adamantly deny any kind of romantic involvement to the point where I honestly started doubting my own sanity. I thought I was going out of my mind. Anywho, all this came out and I basically told him to leave me alone and never speak to me, and that if he really loved this other girl, he'd leave her alone, too, because he's poison. He didn't listen. She and I spoke and worked out exactly what happened. She knows what he is. She stayed with him. I have so much pity for her. \n\nI've since blocked them both on all forms of social media. Except for Snapchat. I haven't blocked him on Snapchat. I'm not sure why \u2014 I just forgot, and then by the time I realized, I didn't really care. \n\nThe thing is... he knows I've blocked him on everything but that.

And whenever the argument is in full force and I\u2019m just bawling on the floor, because I\u2019m out of strength, he will walk away from me, leave me and say it\u2019s all my fault. \n\nSecond, he says he doesn\u2019t intentionally hurt me. For 4 years we\u2019ve been living in his hoarder house that\u2019s also falling apart (roof needed to be replaced since 2004)  without him doing anything. I\u2019ve packed everything into boxes, he unpacked them all. He says he wants to move. He promises me we will move within 6 months. He\u2019s said that for 4 years. I have big time asthma issues because of all the mold in every single room. The windows aren\u2019t insulated either. My health is going down the drain. He doesn\u2019t sort through his own stuff. Also, he doesn\u2019t allow me to have friends over, I do not have money to go out with them, ergo I\u2019ve lost all the friends I made. \n\nHere\u2019s the catch to all of this: I am an immigrant, he\u2019s my sponsor. I have in the past 4 years started to build a life here. I found my dream job. I come from abuse in my old country, I can\u2019t go back. My immigration was supposed to be done by June last year, but because of the changes to the system I am on pending status until at least June 2020. If i left him I would lose my status and would have to go back, where I have nothing now and likely wouldn\u2019t be able to build a future anymore. \n\nHelp. :-( \n\nTL;DR, much older husband gaslights me every day, and isolated me from my friends, forces me to live in a house that makes my health decline. Can\u2019t leave him, as I\u2019m in pending immigration. Need help dealing with all of this. ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I felt obligated to do that because of the way we had started out.

A year into the relationship, I dropped those three special words. \n\nWhat should have been a beautiful moment, turned into one of the biggest mistakes I made in that shit show of a relationship. \n\nWhen I first said it, we were laying in bed and it just felt right. He became giddy with joy. Asking me to whisper it to him over and over. This made me so happy. And then he said this:\n\n\u201cYou know I can\u2019t say it back to you now, right? I mean, I don\u2019t know if I can trust you yet. A few more things need to be proven first. But I really like you!\u201d\n\n..\n\nWhat the fuck? Look, I get it. If you\u2019re not ready, that\u2019s totally understandable. But to tell me that, after a year, you don\u2019t trust me (for literally no reason other than the delusions he created in his mind) and that I have things to prove?\n\nI had that stomach sinking feeling and thought \u201che won\u2019t use this as a game. Surely not.\u201d\n\nAlas, I was wrong. I spent the next few months chopping, changing and switching myself up to fit into the mould he had so meticulously laid out for me. That\u2019s a story for another time. \n\nEventually, he began to use those three letter words against me. It would go something like: we\u2019d get into a fight, he\u2019d say something to the effect of \u201cthis is why I\u2019ll never tell you I love you. Look at you. Do you think you deserve it?\u201d, and I\u2019d end up giving up and apologising. \n\nSome of my favourite lines were:\n\n\u201cI do feel that way about you. But, I think I\u2019ll wait until we\u2019re married to tell you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat difference does it make wether or not I say it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you rather me say it and not feel it, or feel it but not say it? You can\u2019t have both. Pick one.\u201d\n\n-\n\nAs time went on, this began to really rip me apart. I felt unloved and undeserving of love. \n\nI stopped asking and began to grow numb to the situation. So, he escalated. Every phone call to his mother would end with an \u201cloooooove you mum, the best woman in my life.\u201d \nHe would side glance at me for my reaction. At first, he got exactly what he wanted. I was visibly hurt. Then I became numb to that too. He continued to try and find new games to play and ways to hurt me.  He would tell literally every person around them how much he looooved them, except for me. I didn\u2019t deserve it. \n\nAs the death of our relationship neared, so did my emotions. I stopped telling him I loved him, but not for any other reason but that I simply didn\u2019t feel it anymore. To be honest, I didn\u2019t really feel much of anything at that point. \nI didn\u2019t even notice that I hadn\u2019t been saying it until he pointed it out, and called me a \u201cfucking bitch\u201d for it. He also claimed he knew exactly what kind of game I was playing. Yeah, no shit. Ladies and gents, this here is what I like to call a perfect example of projection. \n\nOnce I left and went NC (8 months, baby!), I realised that the person I really needed to work on loving was myself. And if you, dear reader, feel as though you\u2019re undeserving of love as I once did, know that you deserve to love and be loved. You deserve to be appreciated and to feel safe and secure.

I'm going to start around 2005. I was a high school junior with over a 4.0 gpa on track to go to my college of choice on full scholarships and then law school, and I also worked 30 to 40 hours per week as a waitress so I was paying most of my own expenses (but not rent). I eventually did all those things i planned and am now a moderately successful attorney. I was laser focused on my future when I was young so I was generally a \"set it and \"forget it\" kinda self sufficient young person at this point. I was the first person in my family to graduate from college, was valedictorian, and got my law degree with highest honors.\n\nThe kindest way I can put the next part is to say that my family had a lot of problems. My sisters and I, one of whom is close to me in age and lived with me growing up, took care of each other a lot when our parents were failing to meet their responsibilities. There was also a lot of abuse in lots of directions. Mom and Dad verbally abused the shit out of each other ruthlessly every day for years and years with my dad punching walls and cornering my mom sometimes. Our daily lives were a battlefield with them using us as pawns against each other. They allowed us children to be exposed to their behavior toward each other and it scared and confused us so much that I think it has a lifelong influence on our feeling of general security. Mom and Dad also physically and verbally abused us seriously. Dad threw my oldest sister at the wall when she was about 15 because she started dating a black guy (we lived in an area where our school was mainly black and we were white) and then he tore down all of her posters that had any black men in them, including will Smith. I consider our childhood household to be quite abusive, and I have worked quite a bit in the area of domestic violence law so I mean that objectively speaking. Based on my professional experience as a GAL I dont believe our household would have survived any amount of scrutiny by a court or an agency like DCFS. There is a lot more to this but I dont wanna lose ya here by being too long winded. \n\nMy parents got divorced in 2000. Mom and Dad sat us down and said they were doing it for financial reasons (apparently mom had run up $40K in credit card debt and was addicted to large amounts of ephedra which was still legal then) but that we were going to stay together and they would still be a couple and nothing was going to change. Soon dad started disappearing for long periods, like going to the grocery store and then coming back with no groceries 9 hours later, or going on vacation with his new gf during Christmas to visit my grandparents, who hated my mom and thus were fine with my dad having a new gf, but not telling us he took his new gf on that trip until we found out accidentally. \n\nIn the divorce, my dad hired an attorney, who practices now in my courtroom and does not have a good reputation in the legal community today. Back in 2000, she advised my Dad that there was no need for both of the spouses to spend money on an attorney--she could just do it for $1000 and it would be unnecessary for my mom to seek her own representation. In fact, she didnt even need to show up to court, said counsel. Sadly, I now know that this was highly unethical and that my dad getting full custody because of my mom's lack of awareness of her rights and her trust in his word even when they were divorcing was probably not the right outcome. By that I mean that if a GAL had been brought in to represent the interests of the children, Dad would not have gotten full custody and might have had to have his visitation supervised. Instead, mom felt defeated before it even began and she basically just let it all happen. \n\nIn 2004 mom moved out after dad changed the locks while she was at work one day. She came home on a lunch break to take a shit and he wouldn't even let her in to use the toilet. It was ugly to say the least, but my sister had just gotten her license and at least she could drive us to visit our mom. Mom was never well again from that point forward. She descended into alcoholism and died at a young age from a preventable disease. Visitation was difficult but I'm still glad I spent time with her when she was still alive. \n\nNow, back to 2005, I was a teenager and I had planned visitation with mom on a weekend day. Mom didnt have a license anymore but she and my aunt came over to pick me up. The conflict started because my room was messy (honestly it always was, and my house is messy now, and idgaf) so my dad said I couldnt go to mom's. I tried to get into my aunt's Pontiac aztech but he grabbed me by the feet and tried to drag me out of the car onto the pavement. My mom was pulling on my top half but my dad was stronger and a struggle ensued but my dad pulled me out and dragged me on the driveway. For reference, I was 5 foot 4 and 130 lbs, and he was 5 foot 10 and about 250 lbs. There was a huge screaming match that ended in my mom and aunt leaving. I dont remember exactly why they left. \n\nThe battle between my dad and me continued into the house, and we screamed at each other at the top of our lungs. We said the most hateful things we could conjure up. This wasnt our first go around with each other. I was standing on the top step of a set of 12 carpeted stairs and he was in the living room below as we argued. Whatever I was saying (I dont recall exactly what) made my dad so enraged that he quickly charged up the stairs toward me and clotheslined or body checked me by hitting me directly in the face with his massive shoulder. I fell to the ground and he stood over me screaming \"you wanna see who can scream louder than who?\" over and over while advancing forward as I was cowering and crawling backward on the floor of the bathroom at the top of the stairs, a distance of about 20 feet. When he had cornered me and kept coming at me and screaming, I told him to back off and that just made him more angry so I grabbed my virgin mobile flip phone and called 911. During this incident, my sister was in clear view and able to see and hear the whole thing from her bedroom near the bathroom with the door open. \n\nMy dad was and is a volunteer firefighter so he knew a lot of the sheriff's deputies and city police officers. As soon as I called 911, he snapped immediately into a different calm personality preparing to talk to the police and save face with the emergency personnel. My sister claims that at this time he gave her his debit card and told her she may have to bail him out of jail but he now denies recollection of that. He went out into the driveway so that he could talk to the police before I did, ya know, to tell them that we just have an out of control teen here who needs to be put in her place. They took both of our statements and then asked my sister what happened. she lied and said she was in a different part of the house and had no idea what happened. \n\nFor some reason, even though she and I grew up side by side, we have very different views of the world and the difference between right and wrong. In the end, no arrest was made but we were required to go to the police station to meet with social workers. My dad was required to do counseling and to pay for me to attend counseling and a social worker monitored our family for the next year. My dad's side of the family was not shy about shaming me for calling the cops on my dad. They did not however criticize him at all for committing domestic battery against me or for scaring me so badly that I felt I needed help from the police. \n\nYears passed, my mom died rather suddenly and tragically at 55 right after I passed the bar exam. I needed medication to deal with my devastation after losing my mom, and that caused my sex drive to stop completely. My former long term boyfriend sexually assaulted me multiple times after years of physical and emotional abuse. (I am aware that my abusive father may have caused me to seek out abusive characteristics in a partner). I was diagnosed with PTSD, and I already had GAD and depression. I went through a really rough time period there where I dissociated chronically. During that time period (2015), I met with my sister, with whom I shared a close relationship by then, for dinner at a local bar. Somehow the topic of the incident between my dad and me where the police were called came up between us, and she became indignant. She was angry that she was put in the middle, and she blamed me for that. \n\nThen, she proceeded to tell me basically that I'm not a good person and I never have been and how it is always been unpleasant for my family to have to be around me. She then told me that the incident with my dad was my fault because I just enjoy being the victim, and it was my fault I got raped and had ptsd because I just love being the victim. I literally pleaded with her to stop because it will make dad unhappy if we dont get along, but she said she was done with my shit. She and her boyfriend then stormed out, leaving me sobbing alone right as the food arrived. (They did smugly pay the bill before leaving). \n\nI told my dad what happened and he was puzzled that the incident even came up. He took no stance on what was right or wrong in that situation in 2005. I told him I know I was being disrespectful and being a teenager but I just want him to take responsibility too. His response was that he took responsibility by paying for all of our counseling that got required because of it. He wouldn't budge. I thought that maybe if he had grown enough to acknowledge that what he did wasnt right in hindsight, and if he were to explain that to my sister, maybe she would let up on me. No go. The true irony here is that my dad's current wife is a domestic violence prosecutor who has a 16 year old daughter with a different dad, and you better believe someone would be getting charged with a crime if they body checked that little girl, no matter what she said. Wife also frequently complains about the family dynamics that make it difficult for victims to report crimes committed against them by household or family members.\n\nNot long after the fight with my sister happened, my dad told me my sister's bf asked for permission to ask my sister to marry him on their upcoming vacation. I didnt want to let a temporary disagreement stand in the way of my longterm relationship with my sister, so even though she never apologized for blaming me for my rape, I texted her that I love her and I hope she has a good trip. \n\nOur relationship has gradually improved since then. She did invite me to her wedding and I went and was nothing but nice and supportive. However, my sister and her then fiance are very simple self described country folks, and they had their wedding in their backyard so I just assumed they weren't doing a whole formal thing with bridesmaids and groomsmen. My dad had previously mentioned that my sister had her bridal shower, and I was sad she didnt invite me but I said nothing. \n\nMuch to my surprise, I show up on the day of the wedding, already crying because I wish my mom were there, and see that 3 girls my sister has talked mad shit about in the not so distant past are dressed as her bridesmaids and conducting a bunch of little pre wedding rituals in which I was not welcome to participate. It killed me inside. My big sister and I had talked about our weddings since we were kids just assuming we would be each other's maid of honor, but instead she chose this girl who she previously said didnt really care about anything other than having a good time (getting drunk). In her maid of honor's speech, she said that she was part of our family now. Like, no the fuck you aren't bitch. This whole day absolutely made me feel like my insides were crumpling up, shrinking, and dying. I contemplated getting in my car and leaving without saying anything to anyone, but I had promised my grandma in another state I would record the ceremony for her and I didnt want to make the day about me so I just did my best to put on a happy face. After the wedding, I kept quiet about my feelings because I truly dont trust my family enough to tell them the way I feel. Part of me doesnt want my sister to know how much it hurt me because I think she would be happy she hurt me and I dont want to give her the satisfaction. \n\nThe wedding was in October of 2018 and things have been pretty calm since then except that I've been having chronic nightmares about my dad and sister ganging up on me and telling me all the reasons I'm worthless and not a good person. These are intense ptsd nightmares that come in between flashbacks of my assaults or recreations of them. I wake up sick, panicking, and frequently vomiting. I have talked to my psychiatrist about this and adjusted meds as best as possible. I have told my dad about the dreams and he seems puzzled and cant understand how those could be based in any real memories. He has a very selective memory that conveniently excludes his own wrongdoing.\n\nHere's the meat of the issue, finally: my dad generally treats my sister like she hangs the moon. She can do no wrong in his eyes. I think he loves her more because she's humble and only a high school grad like him and I'm all uppity and educated. He also acts like getting married is literally the best thing you could ever do. He was so much happier at her wedding than he was when I graduated law school summa cum laude, got a full scholarship to both college and law school, or landed one of the most prestigious jobs in my regional market. I feel his failure to denounce her bad behavior, his failure to tell my sister not to treat me like that because it's not right, constitutes an endorsement of her actions and words, but I dont trust either of them enough to tell them that. Every time I see or hear about him treating her like a saint, I feel like he's telling me that what she said is right. \n\nThis last Friday night was her birthday dinner, and of course maid of honor was in attendance and well lubricated as usual. I put on my happy face and was nice to everyone, but pretty much every time I opened my mouth someone interrupted me or talked over me. It didnt help that I was the only adult at the table not drinking alcohol. My dad and my sister decided this would be an appropriate time to reminisce about what fun they had at her wedding shower (from which I was excluded) right in front of me. She said to my dad in some joke I didnt understand, \"yeah well you weren't technically allowed at my shower,\" and I thought \"yeah neither was I\" but i did not say a word, did not stop smiling, hugged everyone and left while some were still finishing dessert saying that i didnt feel so hot. \n\nAfter holding in my emotions all this time, something snapped in my head, something akin to a ptsd episode. It was like I was broken all weekend, mich worse than usual. Uncontrollable panic attacks, sobbing, and nightmares with obsessive thoughts about how my sister said my rape was my fault and my dad's complicity with all of her actions means that he thinks it was my fault too. I decided right away that I was going to need to have some space from both of them for awhile because their influence seems to be preventing me from recovering from my assaults. On Monday, I sent my dad a long text that was calmly and carefully worded but direct and assertive. I told him I need some space from them and I deserve an apology from each of them, and I requested that he not reply to the message because a back and forth exchange may traumatize me further. He did not reply.\n\nThe real problem with this whole situation is that my dad and my sister are usually my 2 closest family members. I have to admit that I've been thinking a lot about ending my life now that I dont care if it hurts them. I dont have much else left in the way of family and I don't put much stock in the idea of friends. I dont trust them. They come and go. So now it's just kind of me and my dog. \n\nDid I do the right thing? Am I helping my recovery or hurting myself overall by taking some space from them? I have been to a lot of therapy but none lately and I really need to hear what an outsider sees in this situation. Please give me your perspective. If you have read this whole thing thank you so much. ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

For the last 4, he has dated a different girl, but contacts my friend a few times a month to play mind games. \n\nShe believes she will one day marry this guy (and of course he says things to affirm this, despite currently being in a \u201cserious\u201d relationship). She is spiritual and believes he will one day change his ways.  \n\nShe will not date anyone else as she says she can no longer trust guys, but at the same time, she very much loves her ex and wants to end up with him, despite him being the source of her trust issues as he cheated literally hundreds of times.\n\nShe has always been loyal, and forgiving. He was her first (and only) kiss, and first everything.\n\nAny logical issue a friend points out to her about her viewpoint, she dismisses as God calling her to see him differently. She seems to hate so much about the things he did and will be bothered when she sees similar things in another person\u2019s relationship, but will say he was \u201cthe perfect boyfriend\u201d.\n\nWe were good friends, talked every day for about 8 months, I got feelings for her and told her, she told me she didn\u2019t let herself feel things for guys and also told me about the guy she thought she would marry (this was when I first learned of her desire to get back with him eventually).\n\nI tried to pull back from talking to her so much for my own sake because it hurt. She asked me about it, and when I explained to her it was tough for me to continue to be friends like this, she cried and told me I was her only close friend. She also said \u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t feel the same way\u201d, but when asked to elaborate, would not explain. (I think maybe she had feelings but knew she didn\u2019t want to act on them, and give up on her \u201ctrue love\u201d, could just be me being hopeful though)\n\nI went back to talking to her constantly, but became fixated on this abusive ex and found out some of the cruel things he has done to her over the years (from other people). I wondered how she could continue to choose a guy like that over myself (I know, entitled, but she seemed to love our friendship so much it didn't make sense). Of course I never voiced that to her though.\n\nOne day I said something negative about her ex (something that was very true). Since then, she no longer wants to talk to me and has told me I am not a genuine friend for not supporting her view of him.\n\nCan I help her? Is my influence in her life over? I know I can\u2019t \u201cfix\u201d her, but can I have any role in being a healthy relationship now?\n\nShould i be supportive of her viewpoints about him like she wants me to? Should I send her videos about trauma-bonding and narcissist-empath relationships (I really don\u2019t think she would be receptive to this sort of thing, and it could ruin the friendship forever)? Should I give her space? Should I try and avoid any conversations that have to do with the ex boyfriend?\n\nI want her to see the truth so bad, she is losing years off her life waiting for this guy (she turned down a cheer scholarship to a d1 college, which was her dream, among other lost opportunities, and has a low self-esteem, says no guy would ever want her). She is constantly exhausted, breaking out in acne, losing sleep, and stressed. Videos, along with articles about narcissistic abuse, empath-narc relationships, and trauma bonding provide so much clarity for me when before I was so confused how she could be this way, but I don\u2019t know if she could ever be open to them. She won\u2019t go to therapy, as she is convinced it will all work out with him.\n\nThere are many other details I could go into, but I\u2019m hoping there is a systematic way for friends to approach this type of person. I believe she is an empath, based on what I have read. Her ex-boyfriend is a Malignant Narcissist (I don\u2019t think violent and maybe not even angry, though I don\u2019t know), and possibly a sociopath. She rationalizes all behaviors other than the cheating (which she calls a \u201cmistake\u201d, even though it was extremely perpetual).\n\nI have met him a long time ago, and can say he is extremely charismatic and friendly, a stud athlete and he must be a master manipulator.\n\nDespite some of the ways she probably sounds in this explanation, she is a very capable, intelligent, and strong person.\n\nI have been constantly experiencing turmoil for her lately as she seems to be digging in deeper to the fantasy the more time goes on, and the narc is reaching out more lately. Is there any role I can play in helping her face the truth? Or is she on her own in this battle?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I hope you're not too mad at me for leaving, but in the end, I had to do what was best for me. When things start getting too exhausting, I start freezing up, getting dull, flat, lifeless.

You could make a good latte.\n\nThe more we got to know each other, the more intense it got. We both came from less than ideal backgrounds, but I feel like you resents me because my parents were middle-class people; as if my abuse was less significant because my parents didn't live with their parents. I don't know I felt like...guilty for things I shouldn't have to apologise for. It's not like my parents gave me money for anything, but fuck me for having parents who held their own. In fact, even though I considered you one of my best friends, it hurts that I couldn't come to you for anything, even just to rant about my life for two seconds. Because in the end, you always have it worse. And I don't want to discredit it, your life hasn't been great. I know. But there are some times where you put yourself in that situation. Even when I told you that you probably shouldn't have. It's like you thrive on misery, so that when things go oh so wrong, the world has to stop.\n\nI should have seen the signs that something was wrong. For one thing, none of your family talks to you. Except for you sister and your cousin who stopped by, and only because they were on the way to some Broadway play- and they asked me what I was doing with someone like you? I didn't know what that meant at the time. I clarified that we were only friends, but they repeated themselves.\n\nThen you would tell me stories about how you went to a state uni and got kicked out after one semester for having low marks. Your family financially supported you through that brief period of time, despite not having a lot of money, but then when you told me they cut you off and made you responsible for the student loans when you got expelled, did you really expect sympathy?\n\nThen there's the repeated incidences with your \"friends\", the ones who steal your brand new phones and sneakers and sell you shitty, illegal drugs that land you in the hospital. I told you many times that you should stay away from them, but then I hear their names, and I already know what's coming.\n\nWe would talk, text everyday. Almost to the point where you almost made me feel guilty for having other friends, or god forbid go on a date with another guy.\n\nBut the last straw is when you had a housewarming \"party\". It was just me, a couple of your \"friends\" there, and I didn't want to stay. You grabbed my wrist and tried to make me stay. It gave me a flashback to one of my exes, who was very controlling. I shook you off, and you didn't take it that well. I told you I didn't want to stay anymore and that I'm leaving, abd what did you do? You crossed your arms, plopped down on the couch, and pouted. Just like that ex did when I didn't do what he wanted. And that's when I knew I had to leave. \n\nSo, you noticed that my replies had been getting shorter and blander at the time, and I hadn't seen you in months.

He was secretive, but we were in contact for 4 years, and met up a handful of times. Find out he lied about his last name, where he lived, and that he was married (and still is). Thanks for everyone who posts on this sub. It's an amazing resource. \n\nI met a guy through Craigslist years ago. He was charming, fun. After meeting him I find out he's only in town for work and lives elsewhere. I'm ok with it because I just wanted someone to have fun with. (I feared getting too close to anyone because I did not want people to see the true 'horrible' me thanks to bullying, physical, verbal and sexual abuse and an Nmom.) He travels all the time for work. He's super busy he says. He says he's divorced and has 2 daughters. I am open about having a local FWB. I'm cool with a casual thing. He was secretive, so I knew something was off. He wouldn't give me his last name until I saw him in person a second time. (I know.) He says he'd been stalked and was traumatized by it.\n\nWe send long emails all the time. Some are flirty and dirty, others more staid. I figure he wants to sow his oats and I am not as sexually adventurous as someone he want to be around. (Again, because he makes some digs and it is ingrained in me that I am not good enough or deserving enough.)\n\nI try Googling him and can't find anything. \n\nAfter about a year of this I meet up with him where he's working because I wanted to see an art installation and it would be fun to see him. We had a really fun time. We (really, I) lose ourselves/myself and we look into each other's eyes and it's emotionally intense. He then wants to know where this is going, and I should move in with him. I'm stunned. I thought this was just supposed to be fun. This is the 3rd time or so I've seen him in person. He seems pissed off in the cab. He then tells me he doesn't want it to end and starts crying. He asks if we can try. I agree. I meet up with him again and we don't mention it. I'm trying to see if this could maybe work, but am afraid of broaching the subject.\n\nAll the while, it makes me crazy that I can't find out anything about him and he's not easily available. We only have contact by email. I have a cell phone number for him, but I never call him except when we're arranging to meet. Nevertheless, I fantasize being together, that this could actually work. When I'm in the metro area he lives in for one reason or another, he is never available. (I am more comfortable with fantasy as an Adult Child anyway.)\n\nI wind up moving in the same metro area he lives in. We meet up a couple of times when I first move there and only on week days. Then, he tries to make it so that I'll get pist off and 'break up' with him. I try to be reasonable and tell him if he is tired of me and wants  me to leave him alone, I'll do that. I wanted him to be the one to tell me. He had to have some drama instead. So after 4 years he ghosts me. \n\nFor some reason I'm recently compelled to search on his email accounts I have for him and (shocking!) he has a different last name. He and his wife's FB accounts are public. His LinkedIn is also out there for the world to see. On his FB page it says he got married the year after we had no contact. But property tax records show they've owned the same house together for ages. His wife's FB page aligns with the property tax records. And, they have 3 daughters, one of whom was a baby or toddler when we first met.\n\nI wondered if I should contact his wife, but I decided against it. I'd just be the crazy person. Her FB page seemed more like an attempt to prove something and a cry for validation.\n\nI felt so stupid for not realizing that he is a narcissist who wanted me only as another source of supply, and tried to emotionally hook me, and to make sure I was hurt when he was fully done with me. I stupidly thought he wanted a lassiez-faire thing with no strings. Being an empath with an NMom, I was easy prey. (I only recently realized that my mother is a covert narcissist, and until then didn't understand the empath/narc relationship.) \n\nThanks to all of you who have submitted and responded. I've been in the process of learning about all of this. It's liberating to know the truth and just stay NC. \n\nEdited: accidentally submitted before reading through and added a TL;DR\n\nEdited again: added part about the emails, lots of emails when it was still a thing.

Or suggestions for other healing/treatment methods?", "author": "NotDeadYet_XIX", "self_text": "I already suffered from GAD and had already been through a few abusive relationships, (I\u2019ve actually only had one partner who was not abusive,) when I started dating my NEX. I\u2019d known him for several years and considered him a close friend but had usually been dating other people and so was he. But I had opened up to him about some of the things I\u2019d been through and I know now he only used that as a weapon. \n\nWe started hanging out more frequently not too long after I got out of a relationship and long story short, before I knew it I had a complete stranger living in my house and was entangled in an intense and abusive relationship. \n\nHe did a lot of really awful things to me. But his method of isolating me was incredibly insidious. I often used various drugs recreationally and had done so here and there with no issues of addiction. I was under the impression he was in the same boat. When in fact, he had been a methamphetamine user since I had met him several years earlier and almost everyone in his life had zero idea. I have always been willing to try anything once and when he brought up trying it he assured me he had done it \u201ca few times and it was all good.\u201d Which it probably would have been, had anything he\u2019d been saying been remotely true. \n\nPretty quickly once every few weekends turned into every weekend, turned into on some weekdays but no later than 9p, turned into every single day non stop. The escalation was quick enough that I hadn\u2019t really noticed that I had someone putting the drugs in my hand every single day. No matter how little of an addictive personality you have, taking a drug that addictive daily will form a physical dependency. Mission accomplished. Hook line and sinker. \n\nObviously, isolation would come pretty naturally as I didn\u2019t want my friends or family to know so I only had him to turn to. Supplier was also conveniently someone who only he knew and had contact with. So I needed him to supply my habit. And of course, it was a perfect way to tear me down, convince me of my worthlessness and mental instability, and gaslight me with relative ease. I\u2019ve never actually let someone convince me that I was actually worthless, but for a while I started to believe him. It was a pretty genius and effective method, to be honest. \n\nTo fast forward through a lot of trauma and abuse, I was able to get away and stay away. But I was ruined. A complete shell of my former self. It\u2019s been two years since it ended and I have battled my substance abuse and relapses throughout that time in addition to the C-PTSD symptoms. But over the last few months those symptoms feel like they\u2019ve escalated. My disassociation is out of control. I go weeks without feeling much of anything emotion wise. After reading into disassociation associated with narcissistic abuse I think I\u2019m stuck in the freeze response mode, (as in the four threat responses, Fight, Flight, Freeze, and Fawn.) I avoid literally any and everything. Even things I want to do. And am so bad about putting things off and zoning out before I have to do something that I am almost always late. Sometimes I can lay on my bed after work in complete silence and lose anywhere from 3-6 hours. I\u2019m also afraid I\u2019ll never be able to harbor healthy intimate feelings for anyone again. I don\u2019t feel much in the way of attraction and I have trouble displaying any affection or intimacy. Sometimes I am ok with receiving physical affection and sometimes I can\u2019t stand the thought of being touched or even talked to in an intimate way. \n\nTruthfully, I just feel dead a lot of times and I\u2019m just not sure what steps to take next. Obviously, I need some sort of treatment but my therapist have always been so hit or miss in the past, that I\u2019m not sure where or how to find someone who can help with my specific issues. Any advice or suggestions would be so eternally appreciated. I\u2019m normally such a passionate, loving, and creative person. I\u2019d be overjoyed just to feel like a person again.

My Kens were constantly kidnapping my Barbies and forcibly kissing and raping them, though I don\u2019t know if there were genitals involved; possibly at times they had healthy relationships but I do not remember this. I also constantly played games with myself in which I was being chased for similar purposes. I fantasized about this happening to fictional characters, whose role I adopted, such as Dr. Claw kidnapping Penny (out of sexual desire).\n\nDuring early adolescence I was hypersexual in the sense that I pursued boys for the purpose of feeling like a sexual object. I remember once, maybe 13 or 14, bringing a boy acquaintance upstairs and just taking my shirt off and asking if he wanted to play, and he obliged but smiled wryly and asked if I did this kind of thing a lot, as if it wasn\u2019t normal, and that had never occurred to me until then\u2014that the behavior was weird. I let him and other boys \u201cplay\u201d with me other times as well, including eat me out, though I didn\u2019t have penetrative sex until 16 (with my main abuser). I enjoyed feeling like an object that they were using. I also had cybersex on AOL with older men and sent pictures (not nude).\n\nI know kids explore sex but I am concerned by this theme of kidnapping, abuse, and objectification that seems to arise very early. Do you think this is a \u201cnormal\u201d exploration of developing sexuality and kink for a child/adolescent? I\u2019m wondering if it was just from watching too much TV, though we didn\u2019t have any premium channels, only basic cable. Still, rape culture means even basic TV shows a fair amount of sexual violence. But I just can\u2019t remember a time that I had a healthy \u201cloving\u201d idea of sexual relationships, and my very poor sexual boundaries led me to stay in an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship with my abuser from 16-30.\n\nAlso, my parents were not in an abusive relationship.\n\nTL:DR: From a very young age my play involves rape and I sought to be used and objectified as an early adolescent. I\u2019ve never expected sex to be loving or romantic. I had such poor sexual boundaries that I stayed with a sexual abuser, who I essentially \u201cserviced,\u201d for 14 years without once considering that it was abnormal (until my therapist pointed it out 4 years later). In my thirties now, I only fantasize about being abused; I can\u2019t orgasm any other way. Is this a sign I may have child sexual abuse and don\u2019t remember? Is that really a thing that happens, to just totally forget? Or is it likely just social/cultural influence and/or normal sexual exploration of kink? ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

It's been an extremely bumpy road since then because in the divorce papers, he claims the abuse never happened and that I made it all up. He says because I came from a religious christian household, that I was too afraid and ashamed of wanting a divorce, so, I made up the abuse allegations to have an excuse to call my father to take me away. Which is absolutely ridiculous. My step-mother has been divorced 3 times and my father married her and loves her dearly. My uncle (dad's side) has been divorced twice, my aunt (dad's side) had a divorce, my uncle (mom's side) had a divorce, my older brother has been divorced. Divorce is not in any way new to my family and no one in my family looks down on it. They all understand that sometimes things don't work out. I left because he was abusive and it tears me up inside that he is denying it. I figured he would but for some reason, it still gets to me. \n\nAnyway, I have to file a response to the divorce papers. My attorney asked me to write down my story and send it to him as well as addressing every allegation my abuser put in his divorce complaint. I have sent my attorney my journal entries (I kept a journal of the worst abuse episodes. I wish I'd written everything down but at the time, I would only write if it was especially bad) and a recording I took the night before  I left of him verbally abusing me where I also confront him about hitting me and he doesn't deny it (he doesn't directly say he did either, he just makes an excuse for it \"but you were doing this\"). I took the recording because I was afraid no one would believe me once I left. I was afraid of exactly what's happening, that he would deny it and it would just be my word against his. After sending them, my attorney said we may or may not use them. (He said it was legal for me to take the video in our state but I don't know if that means it's admissible in court.)\n\nTo the point: I have to write down my experience for the response. I don't even know where to begin. At the start of our relationship? When the little things started happening? Or do I only address the big things after it started getting really bad? My journal entries alone are 50+ pages and that's only some of the big things. I can't possibly tell the entirety of what happened without it being too long. I don't want to minimize anything or leave anything out. I have realized I don't know how to write down my experience. How do you put all that trauma into words on a page without diminishing what happened? I don't want it to come off cold and detached and \"just facts\" but I also don't want to write a 100+ page emotional rant. As well as I have to address his allegations after telling my experience. Any and all advice would be helpful!!!! Also any advice on going to the hearing for the divorce motions where I will be in the same room as my abuser. I haven't seen or talked to him since I left about 6 weeks ago (I got a protective order, as well). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I have to respond to my abusers divorce papers where he alleges I made it all up. I have to respond and tell my experience but I don't know where to start or how to do that. I welcome advice for that as well as facing my abuser again at the hearing.

I'll never speak to Br again, but I'm trying to have a sort of relationship with them for (daughter's) sake. I tried for a while and tried to block out their betrayal from saying they loved me and (my son), and then completely disappearing. But I couldn't any longer. It's best this way for me.  They can still be (daughter's) grandparents but I'm pulling back my responsiveness and involvement in their lives. It will likely be this way for a long time, if not forever.

I haven\u2019t responded to any of these texts or calls. However what I would like to do is tell him just how awful I think he is. \n\nMy reasoning for this is that I have been overtly nice to him for the sake of our daughter and he has only used that to manipulate me, lie to me and betray me. I want him to know that I\u2019m not going to be kind anymore and state that I know who he is. ( I feel like because I never call him out so he thinks I\u2019m stupid) and yeah I\u2019m pissed and hurt.\n\nMy reasoning not to is that we are in a progressing custody battle so that could go against me.

I was told yesterday about extinction blasts, and this is what it seems like. \n\nWithout going into too much give away detail, the \"your such a fucking bitch, everything you do is wrong, this is not abusive because you are the abuser\" monologue started. Gray rocked it until he again put down my adoration for my kids and went into the\"bad mom\" tirade. I got mad and pointed out that he was being abusive...in his mind we are just \"fighting\" (I thought fighting took two people, not one trying all they can to make the other know that they are a walking, worthless piece of shit).\n\nHe comes down and threats to \"out\" all my \"abusive, neglectful and bad mothering* during a meeting with an official today. I told him fine, go ahead because it just goes to prove how abusive he actually is... official is aware of his abuse and if he did that, I know she would see what he would be trying to do. He goes on about how I am terrified of what he will say (again, I told him to go right ahead) because \"narcissists like you (me) can't stand the thought of being unmasked*. Just before we pull into the office, he says \"if you just admit to what you do wrong, I won't say anything.\" He wouldn't have anyway, it was the whole shame, guilt, pleading, control, humiliation he wanted to dangle. To let me know he is still in control and can use those base abuses, ir threats of, to reign me back in line.\n\nCame out after the meeting and he immediately started to gaslight about what I supposedly said, which I didn't. I told him I absolutely did not say or do what he claimed, and then of course he pulled the \"you are gaslighting and abusing me\".\n\nStopped of to get something to eat. I started taking to a lady with a young kid while out kids played. My youngest went about 10 foot behind me, still in view, and I had to run and grab her before she got in someone else's way. The lady said \"it's okay, go get her, we all have to break mid sentence to run after them\". No biggie, right ..all been there, right? \n\nAs soon as we left, I got berated for that. I put my youngest in danger (btw, he sat there and watched her wander behind me without moving. I had both kids around me btw), how I care more about impressing strangers than taking care of my kids, how the woman was \"talking down to (me) and embarrassing me by teaching me how to parent\". On and on\n\nOh he also went off when we were eating because I made a comment about something he used to joke about years ago. Suddenly apparently I have been saying the same thing for days (lie, it was based on something that happened while we ate) and I was only saying it to get to him because it relates to when another ex cheated (she didn't. She left because of his abuse it turns out. Still, he carries on with the I kicked her out because she cheated bs). Unbelievable. He also got on me for giving him dirty looks and looking upset for sympathy when I was sitting not even looking at him, but looking at the artwork and thinking.\n\nOne of his big things is I always shoot him dirty looks (maybe I do, mainly because he is always being shitty to me and I just can't hide my distain for him and his behavior any more. That and I always look miserable, looking for sympathy. I am not looking for sympathy, I am just 1000000% miserable and can't hide it any more. I can't smile through and fake it at all now. Seriously I look in the mirror and I always look like I am about to cry these days, Even on \"good days\".\n\nWe came home and he continued abusing me verbally. Then started saying how my kids and parents hate me, how they love him (my parents hate his guts. He refuses to believe it despite him verbally abusing my mom), how worthless and useless I am. I explode again (sorry, I know, don't play the game. So drained with it all that the normal human emotion kicks in). Showed my hand (plan) in anger and blurted about the RO I have been advised to get. He claims he is going to get me on a \"3 times out psych evaluation\" and I \"am not going to be able to bullshit that there is nothing wrong because they will have an expert (him) tell them what to look for\". So now he thinks he is going to manipulate psychiatrists.\n\nMy head is spinning again. I read about the empathy supernova too and am feeling it. With him, I learned early to never cry because that shows what really gets to me and I naturally didn't want him to have that addition power over me. He is using my non crying and swallowing up a lot of emotions to try and play off I am an emotionless narc and psycho. I cry when I am alone or talking to my mom, btw. That is one thing he can't break is my holding emotions back from him. He hates it. \n\nSorry for rambling. Any comments would help so much.

This is my throwaway account, because I need some information about what happened without identifying myself. My mother was/is an an emotional abuser with narcissistic tendencies. She was/is a gaslighter, and facilitated my being sexually abused for years by her own father. But I'm pretty sure a major part of what I'm recovering from in my emotional life is related to my mother's insistence that there is nothing wrong with me, when I was anything but neurotypical. I wasn't diagnosed until my late 20s. During my entire childhood, my mother insisted I could do better if I \"tried harder\".  My sensory issues were me being \"spoiled\", or a \"princess\", and my social issues were never taken seriously.\n\nI would consistently misunderstand rules and expectations. For example, I have, more times than I could count, looked up and noticed all of the other children and the teacher have left the classroom, and that I was alone in the dark. I routinely did homework but failed to understand I was required to bring it to school or turn it in. My mother called me \"stubborn\" and \"obstinate\" and \"ornery\", and said it wasn't possible that all the children could leave a classroom without my noticing; essentially calling me a liar every time I tried to provide an explanation for my puzzling behavior.\n\nI feel like she should have known. I never had a teacher who didn't express real concern about me to my parents. Did any of them suggest a learning disability? Autism? I don't know. But wouldn't you do something if everyone said there was something wrong with your child, and your child seemed unhappy and unsuccessful a lot of the time? I was lonely, and bullied by both children and teachers. I made very few friends and kept even fewer. I never got invited to parties, and was strikingly immature. As a child, I was certain all of these things were my fault. As an adult, I can't imagine raising a child like this and being unaware of the child's suffering, or thinking any child would willingly bring these things on himself.\n\nI knew it was dangerous to ask, but every once in a while, I begged her to have me evaluated. She said I just thought I was \"too fancy\" for regular school and wanted her to waste a bunch of money on me just because I was too lazy to write things down. I developed depression and social anxiety, and became suicidal. I dropped out of high school. I feel in many ways that I have never fully recovered from these issues. I sometimes believe she purposefully did not have me evaluated, perhaps because she suspected her father was victimizing me (he had done the same to her), but I also wonder if I am being too hard on her for the place and time. \n\nI feel like I need to know, for my current well-being, what happened to me. Recovering from being undiagnosed as a young person during a time when diagnosis could not reasonably have been expected to have been made (like being dyslexic in the '30s), is one thing. But coming back from being maliciously ignored by someone who, if they had loved you for who you were (or at all, really), could have changed your life entirely for the better, is something else entirely. When I bring this up now, she brushes me off and says she \"can't change the past\". She seems, genuinely, to believe she had no reason to think I had significant problems, or that they could have been rectified (money and insurance were not an issue for us then, for the record). She seems to believe she owes me no apology and that it was she who was the victim here, of having been saddled with such an unruly child.\n\nTLDR: I'm non-neurotypical and went undiagnosed as a child, but am starting to believe there was more to this than just an ignorance of neurodiversity; anyone have any similar experiences?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He discarded me after cheating on me again, (still denies it), and threw me out of our apartment. \n\nI was at rock bottom. I failed out of nursing school partly due to him, I was so depressed, I'd gained a lot of weight. I was basically homeless until my father told me to come back home. I've been a broke college student and had no clue what I was going to do next. I was so weak.\n\nHe came back.

Growing up, I had a near-perfect family. My mom and dad divorced when I was 6, but it must have been the most civilized divorce ever.  I do not recall any fighting, hostility or even loud arguments. All 4 of my grandparents were alive until I was 25. I am an only child and so is my dad. I really did not realize how good things were. Well, it has all gone wrong now. I am in my 40s and all my grandparents have passed away an my mom died from smoking (she had COPD) around 10 years ago.\n\nMy dad remarried when I was a kid, maybe 10 or 11. I was not really upset because nothing changed for me. His wife was always cordial and polite to me, she never tried to replace or badmouth my mom...nothing like that.  In the last couple of years, my dad has developed dementia, though, and things have been turned upside down.  His wife is openly hostile to me. She has slammed the door in my face, hung up on me when I try to call him, tells outrageous lies about me (to Dad and anyone else who will listen) and will not even let me and my dad have a private conversation without her.  My dad tells her to go away and to leave us alone in his coherent moments, but a lot of the time, he is just oblivious.  Remember, I am alone in this. Dad and I are both only children, so there is no one to turn to.\n\nAs you might imagine, there is money involved here. But she is over 80 years old, has her own pension and social security and Dad has set aside a very generous amount for her and given her the house they currently live in along with a new vehicle.  It's always been  known that everything else (my grandparents' home, land family money from previous investments) will be mine.  As his mind continues to deteriorate, she is trying to push me out of his life completely.  For the last 2 years, I took FMLA from my job to help care for my dad and have tried to help with anything he needed.

Now she has decided to \"care\" for him by herself (meaning I have no way of knowing what she is doing.)\n\nI am afraid my dad is in danger. She has even mentioned to some of her family that she is \"tired of taking care of him.\"  I've no clue what meds he is on right now, but he is unnaturally docile and frequently forgets things. She no longer lets me help care for him at all and she frequently yells at him and becomes verbally abusive to him when he forgets things.  I am 100% willing to take care of him myself and I fear she is going to hurt him, or worse. Since Dad and I are both only children, I have no siblings or aunts or uncles to help me or back me up.\n\nWhat can I do?  I have seen what dementia eventually does (my paternal grandfather had it too) and I just want as much quality time with my dad as possible at this point. This is breaking my heart. It is impossible to reason with her at all and my dad's dependent on her for his medical care. He takes serious medications. Insulin, heart and blood pressure meds and she controls it all. I fear for his life at this point.  I need help, I need advice...I need a miracle and I just don't know where to turn for help. Any advice would be so much appreciated.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I spent 3 years with this man, the first year and a half being good. I (we) recently ended the relationship. His violent mood swings got more frequent the last 6 months where he can go from calling me a \"sick, worthless cunt\" to singing my praises 2 hours later. I can't even count how many times this has happened throughout the years. During these blowouts he will punch doors/walls, slam things, stomp around, and has even prevented me from sleeping by ripping off the covers and shaking the bed. He'll act sarcastic and will manically laugh between the insults. This was happening multiple times a week so I learned to just shut down and stay quiet. \n\nMy biggest issue is that I have tried to leave so many times, but now that it is truly over I am left feeling empty and conflicted. I do not think his behavior is acceptable (even though I didn't leave after the first incident), I consider myself a strong woman. I know that this is considered emotional abuse but I'm still stuck believing he is good and kind deep down. Even though he did this at least two times per week. It is so hard for me to accept that he does not genuinely respect or love me, I keep wanting to fix things although I know in my heart I need to walk away.\n\nHe was my best friend, we share the same sense of humor and interests. We could talk about anything (but our relationship) effortlessly. I loved that, I miss that. It's just so confusing when he can flip the switch from being open and kind to becoming a malicious person I do not recognize. And there is no apology for using words like cunt, stupid bitch, junkie, etc... just bullshit explanations like he's stressed. \n\nDoes anyone else struggle with accepting that their ex/partner IS abusive, despite having many qualities you appreciate? How long did it take you to detatch emotionally? I'm aware that from a 3rd party perspective it's like \"why the fuck are you even conflicted? This guy is a textbook douche\". I agree with that which makes my conflicting feelings even more frustrating. How do you get over the contradictory feelings? ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

In my experience with my narc, he is very good looking, has always had success at work and at school. In his past relationships, he never felt things were his fault.

But this started when I was 13 and in SEVENTH grade.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat happened was, this girl was bullying me for a long time and eventually accused me of staring at her when I wasn't... or at least not on purpose. Her friends originally sided with me but eventually they switched sides and I don't know why.\n\nShe eventually went as far as accusing me of looking into the girl's lockerroom WHICH I NEVER DID. She even lied and told teachers I created an alt snap account to stalk her which I never did do. I talked to my therapist at the time about it and she told me that she was doing it because she got positive feedback which she did. She says that I \"follow her around\" when I don't... it's a small school and\n\nShe didn't just falsely accuse me of harassment, she also bullied me and made fun of me behind my back. I even overheard her once making fun of a point I had in a class to her friends just because she didn't understand it fully. She kept saying I was \"making her uncomfortable\" but whenever U;d ask her how she'd just say \"well you're making me uncomfortable and I don't like it\". I wanted to talk about the issue with her but she never would even tell me what I did wrong. She'd only tell other people and eventually I'd hear about it. She even would send her friends at me.\n\nWhen I finally told a teacher about it and she got in trouble. Her friends yelled at me and made me feel like I was the one doing things wrong and that this was all my fault. Even though I know I didn't do any of this, I still felt guilty. I felt like I did a bad thing to her and that I ruined her life somehow by going to a teacher. The other thing is, she told me \"WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TALK TO ME!?\" after I went to the teacher when she was the one refusing to talk to me.\n\nI had a harder time being attracted to girls or even being friends with them because I felt guilty and all of these girls ganged up on me and bullied me and made me feel awful. I had a hard time trusting girls because of this incident. Not to mention that this went on for a year... I was able to convince the teachers of my innocence but that didn't stop students from bullying me.

He told me he has been in therapy before, 10 years ago.\n\nHe was a covert type, but also seems lower on the spectrum of NPD qualities. I can't figure out how much of what we had was real. He has few friends, and great taste in music. I think we could at least go to concerts together.  He has a fitness background, and it might be nice to have a workout buddy.  I know I can't fix him with my love, but I do believe there is redemption for some people. I am not reaching out to him. He has to break NC.

Sore muscles were the same. I used to love spontaneous massages but don't anymore because of his massages. He'd push his nails into my sore muscles or knots, he'd massage me with no oil/lotion and would continue to rub me after I asked him to stop because it hurt when he didn't use lotion/oil and he used his nails.\n\nAfterwards he'd always want sex.

Don't hold on to somebody that's broken. They are a fractured personality and it's not your job to try to make it work or feel sorry for them. YOUR happiness matters and if it comes at the expense of yourself to make things work with this tyrant then it doesn't matter how much you love them... It's just not worth it. \n\nI was engaged to a very beautiful and stunning woman who I met through friends. I had been single for a while after getting my heartbroken by my cheating ex. Unfortunately it created a perfect storm of me being codependent and and looking for that perfect person to complete my hurt and loneliness. It started off in the typical manner: massive passion, love bombing, moving very fast, and actually getting engaged very quickly. She was my dream girl. Someone who shared my fitness and bodybuilding passion, intelligent, gorgeous, had a daughter and showed interest in mine, and an unbelievable connection on so many levels.\n\nBUT... Those red flags were there but I was so blinded by her overwhelming love and attention that I ignored them. About a month in I started noticing some weird behaviors: Moody, very irritable, suddenly pointing out my flaws, and getting upset when something didn't go her way and pulling back affection. Then I started noticing that when she would do something wrong or treat me badly she would blame me. Overtime it progressively got worse, she began to look through my social media and question who I talked to, would get upset if I didn't message her back immediately even at work, would message me hundreds of times a day, created scenarios where we had to move to tropical places and completely irrational situations. The things she used to idolize about me suddenly became critiques. Apparently my leanness and muscularity wasn't enough, other times it was too much. the clothes that I wore she loved we're suddenly ugly and it made me look bad and she would put me down and just say I'm going to tell you if I don't like something because I'm trying to help you. Suddenly my career was a problem as a teacher and she insisted I do her path. she refused to work more than 3 days a week and insisted I somehow have more money even though I had debt and responsibilities as a single dad. \nShe even hit me when I was holding her hand and told her that I think she needed some emotional counseling and help to deal with her emotions and she raged on me. the worst moment was on her birthday when she decided to take out her anger on me and punch me repeatedly because she was angry at someone else. we somehow stayed together and things got better when we finally moved in together for me to only leave three weeks later because it was just too insane and damaging to me and my daughter. She took over the whole house, wouldn't let us eat food that we bought together, screamed at me everyday and blame to me for every situation when I did nothing wrong. In the end I snapped and I told her right to her core what she really was, and that I know she was a liar and an abuser and that she needs to stay the hell away from me from now on. She couldn't take it and she discarded me which is probably the best thing I could have ever done even though it was not in my character normally to do something like this. As usual a narcissist who finally discards you we'll go on a vendetta to smear your name. She posted all over social media about how I was abusive. but as I found out from her close friends and even her best friend they told me that she was abusive and very selfish and hurtful to them too and that I was better off without her. \n\nNow you're probably wondering why would anyone stick around with this. She broke up with me so many times but would suck me back with sex or just love and attention. I think it comes down to my own character flaws and that's something that I always try to get people to point out who are in this situation is to look at yourself. As much as I believe I'm an attractive person and I am a bodybuilder so my body is very healthy and fit I still had self-esteem issues and believing that I could find an attractive partner with a strong and passionate connection. I think that along with my own flaws of always trying to fix others kept me in this terrible situation way too long. \n\nI think sometimes we hold on to the person because we romanticize the amazing times they give us and we forget the abuse they service us on a regular basis.\n\nMy message to you all is this. So much better is out there waiting for you. Believe that 100%. After Christmas I was so depressed but I decided to focus on myself and believe that so much better was out there waiting for me. And guess what happened. Suddenly, I had multiple girls messaging me who were interested in me and reached out to me. I had no idea that so much better is really waiting for you when you work on yourself. Right now I'm with an amazing woman, who is absolutely stunning and beautiful, kind and just damn easy going. She asked me out even though I wasn't really looking for anybody and was holding on to this hurt with my narcissistic ex. If the roles were reversed I don't think she would ever be interested in me but boy was I wrong. \n\nYou are all worth more than the abuse that these fractured people give us.

I was just about to turn 19 when I met Andy (names in this are changed for the sake of privacy) He was a friend of a friend I made at drama college and we met at her house party, I mentioned the fact I enjoyed smoking and he gave me his number and said he could hook me up anytime. We had an easy seller/buyer relationship for a long time and we even began to exchange short life stories when we met. A note for this story, at the time of the incidents I was 20, by all respects I should have been \u201cmature enough\u201d to handle the situation but I am not someone who deals with sexually charged situations in the real world on a regular basis, I had only had sex once and was (and still am) very insecure about my looks, body and experience level. Andy was 36, and had a long term gf whom he was in a ploy relationship with. Anyway, last year he held a 4/20 party for a couple friends and customers, I was easily the youngest in attendance by a long shot. At this party I had decimated a brownie and two spliffs and was suitably fucked up. (I feel it\u2019s also important to note that Andy had not been smoking or drinking as he was using the night as a tester for the new higher dosage in his edibles)I was the first and last one there, waiting for my taxi. While we were alone he talked about how attractive I was. A few weeks back when I had met him for my pick up when he asked that we go to a local pub and have a chat as I seemed upset. I ended up explaining that I had made a recent suicide attempt and had been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was 14, disclosing such personal information made me feel like I could trust him, as he listened to me and seemed genuinely concerned. In addition to this we had discussed kink in the past as it was something we had in common, despite the fact mine was more hypothetical and his definitely practical. At some point he moved my hand to his crotch to show me just how into me he was. It was at this time my taxi rang to tell me it was outside. Andy offered to walk me to the lift and that\u2019s when everything went wrong. He began by kissing me, before roughy pushing me down to my knees and unbuttoning his jeans. He had me perform oral sex on him before he pulled me up by the arms and pushed me into the lift leaving me to go down, get in the car and wonder what the fuck just happened the half hour drive before i was home. He continued to message me in a sexual manner until July when things came to a head. By this point we had exchanged numerous texts of sexual nature (no pics) and I knew what he wanted from me. On the last day I saw him I had made it clear that I could only stay for a few minutes, that I would be picking up and leaving straight away. Andy ignored this and invited me to the couch, even pulling me into his lap. I knew he had a ddlg kink and I am a 5ft, 15 year old looking motherfucker. I got steadily more uncomfortable before once again I somehow ended up on my knees in front of him. It was worse than last time. At one point the door rang and he had to leave to answer it, he told me not to move. As soon as he left all I wanted to do was grab my bag and headphones and make some rushed excuse as I ducked out the door past him. But I couldn\u2019t move. I realised in that moment why I had let this go on, why I let this man I wasnt attracted to talk to me and treat me this way. I was scared of him. His age and status as the only dealer I knew as well as someone I had previously considered a pal if not a friend, made me scared to tell him no. Ask anyone of my friends or family, I\u2019ll stand up for complete strangers, but rarely myself. It was on my knees on this 36 year olds floor that this hit me and I felt such a deep shame. When he came back, he saw I hadn\u2019t moved and told me what a good girl I was. The thought now and at the time made me feel genuinely sick with the situation but mostly myself. When he had finished he gave me my green and I left. He texted me to ask if I was ok. I didn\u2019t reply. I cut off all ties with him and have been struggling to deal with this ever since. I still don\u2019t know if this is something that I let happen or if I was just in a bad situation with a bad person. Really I\u2019m just posting this to get some sort of opinion as I refuse to talk to my friends about it. It\u2019s something that makes me feel dirty and ashamed for \u201cletting it happen\u201d and I would like to gain some closure, without ever having to see Andy again.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Two of my younger sisters deny it ever happened. One hasn't said anything either way, but we don't talk about it. We don't talk at all. My Step Mother's doing.\n\nI sent my oldest sister a text letting her know about my blog. I let her know it was pretty intense at times and that it may not be for her. She said she might cry.

She told me she loves me tons.\n\nAnd I love her, and I am so glad she decided to read them. but it was also a clear dismissal. She's not going to talk to me about it. She isn't going to be on this journey of healing with me. Her journey is her own and isn't any indication of my worth, but I still feel alone.\n\nAll of us, abused by the same person, if we talked about it, worked to heal together, maybe we could bear up each others pain.

I know who I am deep down, because I was like this before I met him. It\u2019s just very hard to allow that person to come out again. \n\nPeople who knew me when I was still with the ex aren\u2019t used to this new me. Sometimes maybe I get a little too energetic and outgoing. I\u2019m just happy and excited. I see pieces of the old me coming through, but, like I mentioned, a lot of people don\u2019t know me as this. Most of the time I catch myself and think - who was that person?  That\u2019s not me. That can\u2019t be me. What\u2019s wrong with me for acting that way?  Yes, old programming still has a chokehold on me. \n\nThe ex is long gone, but the emotional scars remain.  I\u2019m tough on myself, because I expect I should be completely over that chapter in my life. My therapist flat out told me I\u2019m still healing and recovering. I agree with her completely. I still have nightmares about my ex, where I wake up and have to remind myself I\u2019m not with him anymore. \n\nThe other thing that is becoming somewhat annoying for me is comments made by others with respect to my current situation. I have some friends that bring up subtle reminders of my ex. I have some that think I should be dating furiously and finding random people to sleep with. I think that upsets me the most, because there was a lot of sexual abuse in my relationship.

I've always done my best to be her rock, mostly because that's the person I am and also because of the abuse that she suffered. I guess I am codependent in that way, where I want to always be the strong supportive partner.  \n\nSo from time to time something will come up, something tiny or big, that will \"trigger\" my wife into a state of PTSD. When she's in that state she is fearful, agitated, aggressive, angry, confused, enraged and in all possible ways, downright scary to be around. \n\nAdmittedly she has assaulted me many times, and I haven't retaliated, blocked her or attempted to subdue her in anyway. When she is \"triggered\" she will break anything and everything, especially things that are important to me. I love electronics, I mean really love tech, so naturally they are the first items in our house to be destroyed. The TV for some reason is almost always the first victim of her violence. Of course, if you're gonna break something try and find the most expensive items you can! If my laptop, tablet or phone are around she will attempt to break them by throwing them and stomping on them then throwing them again. I've replace countless TVs due to her violence. \n\nOn one occasion she was so enraged, \"triggered\" that, after a scoufle in our upstairs livingroom she followed me to my downstairs bedroom where I had retreated in defeat. I heard her coming to the room so I grabbed a nearby hammer and held it up, hoping to frighten her away... This time she would not be moved away from me, as she was carrying a footlong knife from our kitchen. So, instead of hurling the hammer at her or doing anything that would hurt her, as I still love her and wouldn't want to hurt anyone with a hammer or anything for thatmatter, I tried to close the door. Well when I did that she immediately started slicing through the crack in the door, as I was closing it, and cut my fingers. She retreated upstairs and pretended like I was attacking her or after her. Once I saw the damage I decided that I needed medical attention. I did end up getting 5 stiches in my finger and had a few chunks taken out of my wedding ring, oh the symbolism of it all. \n\nI, being the codependent cowardly idiot that I am, forgave her, even as she blamed me for the incident. Now, fast forward, 2 calls to the police later where she is berating me about new contacts in my contact list. Desiree and Fabiola. She was furious, livid, hurling insults at me. It didn't take long before she began her physical attack. While I was seated on the couch she grabbed my left forearm and dug her nails deep into my skin, causing me to bleed, then with her left hand she dug her nails into my neck and then began punching me. I, in a fumbled attempt to get away from her and stop her assault struck her with my right hand. The strike was powerful enough to cause a near instant hematoma. She again tried to attack me as I got up off of the couch, but I was able to subdue her with a neck hold using pressure points. Felling horrible that I had injured her, I went and got some ice, Aleve and water for her impending headache. \n\nFast forward roughly 36 hours later and I am being woken up to her yelling at me for befriending a female coworker on Instagram. Luckily this time my bags were packed with all the valuables, as they were at risk for being destroyed. Now the police have a warrant for my arrest and have been to my job. I had to call out of work once because of this situation and now have to explain to everyone why the cops were looking for me. The worst part is that part of me wants to go back. I need help. I don't deserve to be arrested. I just wanted a happy calm life. ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

If they told me to jump I would ask how high and then go two feet higher.\n\n  \n\n\nWhen boyfriends would get upset over insignificant BS I would coddle them and let them rant and feel like it was my responsibility to make them feel better.\n\n  \n\n\nOver the past couple of years my friends and family have pointed out that I need to be treated better. They offer honest insight and opinions on the people I choose to date. They have shown me that everyday kindness is something to be expected not an example of going above and beyond.\n\n  \n\n\nThe first step was up and leaving a year-and-a-half long emotionally and verbally abusive relationship. And then stumbling along with ups and downs through several mini relationships after that, and getting a little more confident and independent and strong with each one.\n\nYesterday, a guy called me trying to tell me he liked me and wanted to date... but in that same conversation asked me for my job benefits and told me he would give me the keys to his house... *so I could let his dog out*. I thought about sending him a message but it's not worth my time and I'm just going to straight up ghost.\n\n  \n\n\nTonight, I matched with a guy on Tinder and we're texting and he asked me to send him a picture of who I am right now. I get not wanting to be catfished but it's like 3 in the morning where I am and I don't feel comfortable taking a picture at this exact moment and sending it to him so I told him that and then didn't send one.\n\n  \n\n\nA former version of me would have follow to these guys demands without hesitation. \"A man is interested in me?? Let me just do whatever he says and wants and placate him so that I can keep him happy and make him feel good and do whatever he needs and wants so that he will love me and..\" uck the idea makes me cringe at myself now.\n\nIt has taken so much love from my friends and family for me to realize that I am strong and beautiful and intelligent and hard-working and that love and happiness is an inside job. It has taken a lot for me to learn that I cannot put all of my hopes and dreams for happiness in another person.\n\nSo several years later and guess what if I don't want to do something I'm not going to do it. If I do want to do something and he doesn't, I'm going to fucking do it.\n\n  \n\n\nI don't need anyone's dick or money bad enough to become a doormat again.

He could have chosen someone else but he chose her. However, I later found out that he did have a choice. I told him that then working together alone and for long hours made me uncomfortable. He said, trust me. For months, I did, but their interactions were so iffy to me. But he said to trust him, that he loved me, that I was the love of his life. A few months later, Something happened (I don\u2019t remember what) but he broke up with me. Less than a week after the break up, He wrote me an email saying \u201cyou were so nasty but I stayed hoping you would change. I liked you better when you were submissive. I was unhappy and I told you I was. And she made me feel things you never did. I began thinking about her, I didn\u2019t do anything with her, but I desired her and kept thinking of her. Now that we broke up, I hung out with her and other friends. She asked me for a ride home. I drove her home, we kissed and I asked her to date me. You caused all this. You see I\u2019m so desperate to be happy and I want to forget you, you caused this.\u201d\n\nI think back to this moment. I hate that I never looked nor desire another man. My lips and body have only belonged to him. I hate how loyal I was to him. My stupid loyalty brought me nothing but pain, abuse and betrayal. \n\nThis thing, where he feels unhappy and continues to be engaged with me, and yet he flirts and cheats somehow it\u2019s always my fault because I don\u2019t make him happy. \n\nHe told me that watching me leave many times has hurt him. And i think to myself, why did I leave? there were many times when I left him. And if my memory is correct, it came because he kicked me out. His favorite line was \u201cif you don\u2019t like it, get the fuck out bitch\u201d. Once he threatened to burn my stuff if I didn\u2019t get out. Once I stood up for myself, and said I\u2019m tired of you kicking me out, I pay rent every month. I have a right to be here. That angered him more. And he began yelling about everything that he didn\u2019t like about me and why he hated me. I looked at him and said why do you say such hurtful things to me, he looked straight in my face and said \u201cbecause you deserve it, and deserve to be treated like a bitch\u201d. I said \u201cI deserve being insulted, cursed at, yelled at and kicked out of my home, simply because during dinner you told me \u201cI said I shouldn\u2019t call you a bitch, now get over it\u201d and I tried to get over it but I was still hurt and not as communicative and that enraged you?\u201d He said \u201cyou are so fucking entitled bitch and I will teach you to fucking respect me. No one does hurts me and and gets alway with it. And know that I will do this again, because You deserve to be treated this way. I walked to my closet. Began packing my some stuff and he was now spitting fire. He tore me to pieces saying hurtful things about my past and using personal insecurities and family issues against me. I pretty much ran out of there. \n\nAnd truthfully, I\u2019m not sure how to explain this, but my body and specifically my soul, feel tired of not having a place to call home. I was with him for 3 years. He kicked me out so often, that I felt no place was really my home. That I had to be prepared to leave if he kicked me out. I was pregnant and he kicked me out. I feel like I need a place to rest my body and not just my soul. I feel homeless. Why was this one of his go to moves?? Why was I the one that had to run with my tail between my legs??\n\nAfter, not just this but so much more abuse, why do I still hurt knowing He moved on after only 3 weeks of our separation. Why does it hurt knowing he is mad at me and blames me for this break up. Why can I logically comprehend that even though I was never perfect, I didn\u2019t deserve any of his treatment. Why do I wonder if I caused him to cheat or hurt me?\n\nThis week has been mostly bad. I\u2019ve had some hours where I feel ok and I\u2019m able to do things. But most of the time I fear that as time passes by, we are becoming more distant and a potential reconciliation is less and less possible. \n\nSee! I\u2019m going crazy!! He moved on with the girl he told me not to worry about. He abused me and somehow I\u2019m still hoping for a reconciliation???? What is wrong with me. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I've lost 88 pounds. I posted about it on my instagram and my narcissistic ex-boyfriend messaged me saying I looked great. I didn't respond, I just deleted it.\n\nI haven't talked to him in almost a year. This is huge for me. We were together for three years but friends for six. After we broke up we had a nasty cycle of him dating other people but he kept fucking me while making me feel like shit. I was 100% sure I needed to be with him so it was VERY hard to break loose. He was extremely abusive, mostly verbal/mental but towards the end it because physical and sexually abusive as well. I was 15-18 when we were together so I didn't really understand. The whole time we were together he really mashed the idea that I was disgusting into my head. He didn't let me dress up or anything. He always made it out that I was lucky to have his attention.\n\nI kept him as a friend after we broke up despite the shit he put me through. I was never truly over him. I wanted closure. I wanted an explanation for why he treated me so poorly. He came over to my house early last year with a friend and try to coerce me into a threesome. I was extremely uncomfortable and immediately had a panic attack. I told him under no circumstance was he ever going to touch me again. I was right, because he never did and he never will again. He flipped it around tried to gaslight me. He swore up and down that he'd never be attracted to me again and I was just flattering myself.\n\nThat made me realize that I will never get closer or an explanation because there isn't one. I didn't deserve the abuse and he definitely doesn't have a reason. Even if he did, he'd never say anything that could justify his actions. I deleted him off everything and blocked his phone number.\n\nIt's taken me awhile to get over him. I have a fair amount of triggers due to the things he did to me.

So I was in a 5 month relationship around 4 months ago &amp; I\u2019m still constantly feeling guilty &amp; second guessing myself for the things my ex-gf said I did wrong.\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing a psychologist the past month as I\u2019m just getting out of my depression and she believes my ex had NPD or BPD. I recorded our argument that led to break up and all text messages to psychologist so she had a concrete awareness. \n\n- The first 5 months we never argued and were very happy until this day:\n\n- Long story short, 1 week before we broke up,  my ex gf lost her phone at a concert. She asked me to hold her phone during the show, and after the show I gave it back to her. \n\n- 20 minutes later, she noticed she didn\u2019t have her phone. She immediately starts screaming and berating me publicly saying I lost her phone and she shouldn\u2019t have trusted me with it.\n\n- I run into the venue and spend 20 minutes finding her phone. I found it- as they said it was in the women\u2019s bathroom so SHE lost it.\n\n - She was really happy I found it, but wasn\u2019t really apologizing for how she acted.\n\n- that night I tell her I love her- she doesn\u2019t respond.\n\n\n- Next morning, I woke up at 4 AM to take her to work- 30 minutes away as we had a hotel the night prior. We stop in local deli, and she asks me to be quick so she can drop her bag off at home instead of her locker.\n\n- I get caught taking an extra 4-5 minutes making my coffee and talking to a worker. I get back in car, and my ex is cursing me out and screaming bc now we couldn\u2019t stop at her house to drop her bag off. I still got her to work 20 minutes early. \n\n- both times I was in shock, so I let her scream and just ignored it.\n\n- that night I ask to talk to her. She says that I need to speak up and that I don\u2019t speak up. So I do.\n\n- we also speak about me saying the words I love you- and that she\u2019s more closed off than I am with love- has trust issues, hates to be emotionally available and vulnerable.\n\n- that night she then texts me saying everything she loves about me. \n\n- The next day I ask to talk to her- I ask her why I haven\u2019t met her parents and if she\u2019s emotionally available with me- she immediately gets upset at me, calls me stupid and a nimwit 7-8 times. \n\n- When I brought up how she texted me saying she hates to be emotionally available, she gas lighted me and said I overthink text messages and never said that. \n\n- 2 days go by and she\u2019s starting to withhold affection and communication with me. She eventually says we gotta talk, and that you say the word love too loosely.\n\n- I recorded this phone call. She begins to say that I\u2019m immature as a boyfriend as a bf bc I\u2019m saying the word love after only seeing her twice a week and haven\u2019t met her family yet. I hold her accountable for not meeting her family, and she instantly gets upset at me.\n\n- Then I try to fix the issue by saying maybe I don\u2019t love you, I just really like you. And when she called me immature as a boyfriend, I called myself a great boyfriend- she immediately interpreted that as relating to the nice dates and flowers I bring her, when I was talking about our BOND. Or the fact that I supported her goals, always listened, affectionate, showed her off, wasn\u2019t clingy, respectful etc\n\n- I end the phone call trying to review things that I have to work on, and she yells at me saying this isn\u2019t school- you don\u2019t take things home and work on them.\n\n- we end up losing service, I try calling her back and she kept rejecting the call. \n\n- Next day we talk on phone and she says we\u2019re too different, starts to bring up how she can\u2019t trust me bc I get free breakfasts at hotels and get out of paying parking tickets. When I say that these issues aren\u2019t big deals, she responded and said \u201cif it\u2019s not a big deal, I wouldn\u2019t be breaking up with you.\u201d  I respond saying what about all the great times we had together- she responded \u201cyeah, that\u2019s before I knew you.\u201d I tell her I want to be with her still, she says she doesn\u2019t know.  \n\n- so we break up, I delete the pictures of us on my IG and block her on socials. She texts me the next day saying I\u2019m corny for deleting the pictures and blocking her AFTER SHE BROKE UP WITH ME.  \n\n- so I interpret that as she wanted me back, 3 days go by and I contact her trying to get back with her. She still saying I\u2019m corny and lame for deleting the pictures so I tell her that she shouldn\u2019t have broken up with me if she didn\u2019t want them deleted. That I tried my hardest and you wouldn\u2019t let up. \n\n- This was her response -  \u201cthis victimized bullsh*t is exactly why I\u2019m like Naah, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m too solid for it. Like you keep trying to justify your actions with \u201cyou name called me\u201d like cmon that was all loose, if you can\u2019t handle me calling you a dimwit, I\u2019m not the girl for you.\u201d\n\nAt this point, I lost my cool and finally told her off.\n\n- I call her abusive, that I fell in love with a facade and say she never cared. She responded telling me I\u2019m entitled and privileged bc I\u2019m white.  Story over. \n\nBut I still miss her as crazy as that sounds. \n\nTl;dr is my ex a narcissist?\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The biggest one. There was a certain \"type\" he seemed to be into, and it was not me. His ex was that type though.

Im very new to this sub-reddit and this account is new since i had forgotten my old one. I'm Fifteen living with my Father and my Older sister who is 21 (Her name is Maya). My father is sixty years old and has gone through two divorces and has 2 daughters and sons (which were step-sons). He is disgusting. He cant clean for shit. He blows his money on girls that are way too young for him and that are drug addicts. My second sister who is thirty-five(Her name is Kim), has disabled all contact. He had passed down Bi-polar disorder and PTSD to her. My other sister is moving down there to be with her and to get away from my father, but I stuck here for a few years. He has Mentally abused me since i was very young. My mother has schizophrenia and had to leave us when i was a baby, so he raised me and my Sister Maya alone. He uses his \"nice actions\" as fuel to shit on me every day. Just today, we were going out to lunch and I was talking about driving school when im done with my job at the end of the summer. He immediately exploded. He screamed in my ear, banged all over the car, raised his fist at me multiple times and degraded me and my feelings. He said I was a waste of space, that he hated me and I was good for nothing. He's calmed down and about 6 hours later he said says i started it and if i couldnt handle his rage, i shouldnt start shit. My sister took me out shopping to get my mind off it once we got home (We didnt even go out to eat, we got to the parking lot, and he screamed more and we leave immediately. He said I dont do anything and everything is ''His job''. He told me I wasnt a victim. I once told him i wanted to kill myself and he shrugged it off and said jokingly \"We wont have that- no.. no killing\\~!\" and laughed it off. Im drained.  He only ever talks about himself and talks shit about my sisters and mom. When he starts to scream at home, I just go to my room and ignore him because I dont want to fuel him and I dont really care about him anymore. I want therapy and my sisters are helping me get it. He ruins my mood and self-esteem almost weekly. I dont know what to do anymore. I try fighting against him but nothing works, But i cant keep silent. His screaming makes me want to rebel more (Im a goodie-two shoes but because he acts like this, It makes me not want to follow his rules or do what he tells me) im tired of the gaslighting and the verbal abuse.

I need help and am desperate.\n\nMy oldest brother Daniel is 7 years older than me. He took advantage of this by making me his personal servant. I mean I'd carry out at least 15 tasks for him daily. He owned me. I tried saying no and he stomped me and even sprained my muscle in my lower leg. \n\nHe loved preying on me. It made him feel powerful knowing he had the power to hurt someone. It made me feel powerless. If he ever saw me smiling, laughing, or happy he tried to shut it down immediately, and it worked. He told me once that I wasn't worth the clothes I was wearing. \n\nDaniel HIT me. A lot. He left both of my arms extremely purple from shoulder all the way past my elbow. Had to wear long sleeves for a whole week. Threw me down the stairs. About 2 months ago he peed on the floor in my room and used my clothes to clean it up, and put the pee soaked clothes on my bed. Yesterday he told me if he sees me alone he'll kill me. \n\nToday he wiped his butt after pooping on my bed comforter and put a pillow on top of the smear so I wouldn't find it as quick. I went to sleep the whole night last night wondering where the foul smell was coming from then found the smear after several hours of searching for left out food that I may have forgotten. Today I told my parents what he did, frustrated as you can probably imagine, and even showed them the shit smear on my bed comforter. My dad turned it around on me and even told me I have no right to feel angry, and my mom said she doesn't wanna hear my shit. She told me to just wash the sheets. \n\nWhat they don't get is it's not the physical things that hurt me. Of course shit stains on my bed aren't fun, but the mental factor is what really bothers me. I feel inferior to Daniel, and everyone else. I have horrible self esteem. I don't feel like I deserve anything, because my parents didn't protect this. They always say they don't know where I went wrong. I tell them exactly how I feel and why, but they just do not understand or even attempt to.\n\nDaniel walks in to my room as he pleases when I tell him not to and takes what he wants. I've caught him stealing money from my room and when I confronted him he got aggressive with me! He took the money and I told my mom. She said basically it wasn't a large enough amount for me to be this upset. I don't deserve anything in his opinion. I tried ignoring him, and consider him an enemy rather than family. My parents tell me I can't do this anymore. I have to fake like him so that there's peace in the house, and out of \"respect.\" I am expected to take all his bullshit, and I have been for too long.\n\nWhen I was in 8th grade, Daniel dropped out of college. Starting from 9th grade, many days I didn't get the chance to do my school work, because as soon as I got home my mom would take me and go to the park. We would sit there all day and come back at night and go straight to sleep, just to avoid being around Daniel. My dad is a truck driver and would be on the road for weeks at a time. Daniel was particularly abusive during these 2 years and confrontation was expected daily. I mean my life revolved around the abuse this guy was dealing me. I would dread walking into the house after school. If he was upstairs, he wouldn't even allow me to go to my room and change from my school clothes. He didn't want to see me, he hated me. Being around him was walking on eggshells, he can snap in 5 minutes and do anything he wants with no consequence. He knew this. I knew this.\n\nYears of having such a fearful relationship has led me to develop severe anxiety, social anxiety, depression, repressed emotion, emotional numbness and digestion problems. I don't feel much emotion, outside of grief for my brother. I dropped out of school because I even got suicidal for the first time in my life. I get blamed for all of this. I know logically this isn't right, but I've even started blaming myself. I want to move out but don't make enough to support myself.\n\nNow I'm 20 and daniel is 27, still living at home Jobless and spends the day boosting his ego by dominating me, and just overall being a sub-human monster. \n\nOn top of this, I'm dealing with grief from the loss of my immediate elder brother. He was very protective of me and I felt comfortable around him. we did everything together. He died in 2016 of osteosarcoma cancer. Daniel knows him just as well, didn't shed a single tear. Since then I've gone all downhill mentally. I deleted all the phone numbers out or my phone and don't have a single person I talk to. \n\nThere are several details I've left out just so this doesn't run too long but I think you can get the idea of what kind of toxic people I've been conditioned by. I keep a knife on me at all times and I'm always in a state of stress and panic. I was recently robbed at knife point by people I don't know and this multiplied the anxiety and paranoia I already feel. This has bled over into my daily life and I can't function properly. I've turned to alcohol and often times drink as soon as I wake. I am restarting therapy this week. \n\nTLDR: older brother abuses me physically and verbally since I was 4 years old and he was 11. He has even gone to the extent of wiping his bare ass after defecating, with my bed comforter/sheets. He's peed on my room floor and wiped it with my own clothes. He's bruised my arm from shoulder to just past elbow for absolutely no reason. He's stomped me for trying to stand up for myself and refusing to get something of his from the living room. He's stolen money from me and I got hit for confronting him about it. He walks all over me and goes completely without any consequence. I'm even now scared for my life in my home and even have to carry a knife to feel safe. This has led me to severe anxiety, depression, emotional numbness, and alcohol dependency. I am blamed for the way I feel. \n\nEDIT\nAh! Forgot to mention. I'm 125 lbs 5'7 20 years old and Male. Daniel is 5'10 220 lbs 27 years old. There has always been a big size difference naturally as he's 7 years older.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It's a long story even though it was only the span of about 4 months but I'm writing this post in hopes that others read it and can learn from it, to vent my story, and to warn others if you come upon him. This is my first post on Reddit and I'm not really sure how this works so apologies if I did anything wrong or offended anyone. This all happened in mid 2017, but honestly has been something in the back of my head because it haunts me that I allowed any person to do this to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**It all began in an app.** I used Tinder hoping to find a healthy, loving relationship. Which sounds really stupid, I know, but I was young and didn't have much experience in relationships. I had just turned 18 a month before I downloaded the app. I was aware most people had used it for hookups but I was awkward and socializing in real life, and hoped that I could actually find a relationship on an online dating app because I was better at texting. When I first saw James I thought he was a fake account because he was too good looking, and also had some serious muscles, I added his SC that was in his bio and we began to message. I was shocked to find out he was the real deal and not some catfish account. Little did I know he really was catfish, not in his looks but in his personality.\n\n**It was \"heavenly\"**. After the first two weeks I thought he was the one despite of the small amount of time spent. We'd talk everyday. We both couldn't drive, he didn't work but I worked so I would pay for uber/lyft to see him as he lived about 30 min away and uber/lyft would be from 35-50$, sometimes I would bus 3-4 hours because it would only cost 7$ and I was low on money. I wasn't that well off as I saved up to about 3k from when I was a kid, never spending money and working as a tutor in highschool, then my senior year becoming a part time worker. He was really nice and seemed accepting towards any flaws I had. We would face time a lot, I felt really happy. Then, certain red flags would pop up such as him saying he wants to take steroids, and him talking and comparing me to his ex. At the time I wasn't knowledgeable about steroids and how it affects anger and sex life, etc. but I knew it was dangerous. I didn't want him to take it but he said to trust him. I also didn't have much relationship experience before this so I ignored these signs. He began to take steroids, specifically Trenbolone. About 3 weeks to a month in our relationship, he got kicked out of his house because he had an argument with his parents then he  threatened to beat up his stepdad, he broke their TV, door, mirror, and a couple other things out of anger. My parents didn't like him and didn't want him(he never greeted them, wasn't polite, and would used our kitchen for meal prep and not clean up) to stay at our house. I would sneak him in. He gave up on his life, he told me there's no point in living he got kicked out and has no where to go. I cried, and tried everything to help him, I eventually ended up paying for him to live at a motel for a week, then his mom came back to help. This was a horrible week, as his mood was up and down he broke up with me about two times and got back with me. My best friend (the only one I would tell the complete story to) was beginning to dislike him. I almost broke up with him, but he threatened me telling me how he knows where me and my family live. His mother found him a place to live (a studio apartment) and he asked me to move in, I was 18, fresh out of high school and had just begun my first semester in college, of course I said no and that I wasn't ready for that kind of commitment as we both couldn't drive and he lived about 30-40 minutes away, so I knew I wouldn't be able to do school and live with him. He, again, uses suicide to get me to this time get my best friend to drive me to the motel where he gets mad telling me how he wants to kill himself etc which makes me feel guilty, even though I had no fault in this.\n\n[Him texting me that he's going to start taking steroids and to \\\\\"trust him\\\\\"](https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/53004997_996434573895490_6938398351041757184_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.xx&amp;oh=a000058ef4290f5588c6d224cc8a8448&amp;oe=5CE1FAF4)\n\n**I moved in with my abuser**. At that time I wasn't aware he was, I was naive, and he made sure to take advantage of that. Everything became a downhill spiral from there on. I got a job at target as a cashier after 2 weeks of my moving in. James did not get a job because he said that he is on steroids and plans to focus on working out at the gym to become a famous body builder which later on will make him rich. I have no idea why I was even okay and agreed on paying for us. His mother tried to help, she was working at a Korean restaurant part time but most of the time she couldn't pay half the rent  of me and Jame's studio apartment which would end up me paying $900 out of the $1,400. We would fight a lot over small things. He got mad easily because he was on steroids and already previously had anger issues. Like for instance he tried to sell a game at game stop for money, he was broke(as usual) and needed to pay for hus new cycle (steroids). Each cycle was about 600$. At the game stop his mom forgot to bring a part of the game so he couldn't sell, he was cussing out shouting at his mom in the parking lot, a bystander told him that's not how he should be speaking to women and he cussed the bystander out calling her a fat bitch, we had to drive away because they called the police. The way that a guy treats his mom reflects in how he\u2019ll treat ANY woman in his life, I have never seen any men or boy calling their mom a bitch and shout at her disrespectfully, especially in public. He also had trust issues constantly check up my phone, I was okay with him going through my social medias and knowing my passwords because I know I have nothing to hide, he would check my phone every now and then and even messaged some of my male friends to stop messaging me. He got mad at me once because I had a picture of the sky as my story, and a guy friends messaged me asking if he could have the pic of the sky. James says I shouldn't reply to any males, or even talk to any males because i shouldn't be entertaining males. To \u201cdo what  I did ti him\u201d James became friends with a 16 year old girl named Kaylee (which was gross because James was 18 at the time) at the gym he went to and they would work out together, he would show me their texts, which was very flirty, and she would even snap chat him nudes. I got mad, he went too far and it wasn\u2019t even a bit close to how my relationship was with my guy friend. I told him going to break up with him if he didn't ghost her, we had a argument about it but eventually he stopped talking to her. During this time I moved out once because of all the fighting, he was sad to find out that I gave up on us living together and guilt tripped me again to move back in. It got worse.\n\n&gt;(NSFW) We were having sex and he got limp(steroids) and blamed me for being too loose or dry. He pulled out his porn and me, wanting to be sexy or some shit, I ask if I can watch with him and like, do it together. He immediately gets angry which confused me as I thought me offering that would be a turn on. He began to break things around the apartment which I start to cry, he proceeds shout at me \"WHAT THE FUCK IS IN PORN? YOU FUCKING TELL ME\" and smack my head, I said stop hitting me, he replied that he wasn't really smacking me because if he was I would be dead. Afraid, I scurry into our restroom, which he told me to get out of. When I replied with no, he stormed in and dragged me out the restroom, tossed me onto the bed and began choking me, I tried to push him off but he was really strong. I couldn't even scream, he was raging to me about how there are dicks in porn and I shouldn't be looking at other dicks, especially porn dicks because they're big (he's insecure about his 3 inch which I never said anything or implied anything to make him feel bad. I only do that now because I realize he's a piece of shit). It all stopped when there was a knock on our door telling us to open. It was the police. And like most victims of abuse, I lied to protect him. I moved out.\n\n[900$ I paid for rent](https://i.redd.it/q5f14oo83gi21.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Him telling my friend Mike(let\u2019s call him Mike)  off for messaging me.

He said if I come back to him, he'll give me a better life. One too many tries, I let him try again, I moved back in and the same, old routine of me taking 1.50$ bus to work, I worked full time as a cashier at the target where his gym was. He would make his mom take him or make his mom pay for lyft/uber, while I resorted to taking the bus two thirds of the way then walking because it was cheaper. I constantly tried to save up because I would be spending a lot on rent, food, and other necessities, while he kept asking me to buy him gym wear or other things. I felt like everything was really one-sided.\n\n&gt;I stopped (NSFW) \"servicing\"(suck his dick) him in bed. He got mad I didn't want to. I said I was tired and he asked what the fuck am I tired for because I'm only a cashier all I do is stand around all day. We began to fight but it was soon over because I had to go to work.\n\nI came back and we just didn't talk to one another a much. Then I began to noticed recently how he has been getting texts from girls which he would brush off as nothing. One night he leaves his phone unlocked and fell asleep, I never looked through his phone even though he would always check mines but I was highly suspicious, I found out he had been texting, sexting, other girls and maybe even meeting up, I locked the phone after just viewing a few messages because I was in shock and disgusted, I felt that I couldn't handle reading anymore. I went outside in the parking lot to cry, feeling betrayed that after all I've done and suffered through he couldn't even stay loyal. I waited till he woke up and I confronted him, asking him if he's been sexting/texting other girls. He said no, I bursted out calling him a liar revealing that he left his phone unlocked and I had seen everything. He tells me that I shouldn't have went through his phone. He asked me what's point of having a girlfriend if she doesn't service you. He blamed me for him cheating. We had a long conversation about it and he let me move out-- this time not begging or threatening with suicide for me to come back. I would stay weeks at my best friends house as I had not spent time with family nor friends during my relationship with him because a lot of them didn't like him, which he would make me cut off ties because he said they were toxic and didn't understand our relationship because they aren't in our relationship. My best friend was really supportive and wanted me to break up with James, which I found really hard because he would call me and cry because he said it feels like I'm distant (I fell out of love after he physically abused me, and cheated on me). After Christmas he broke up with me because I spent Christmas with my best friend, and I told him next Christmas I'm spending it with my best friend too. He tried to get back with me but I would reject, and we even became FWB but I just lost interest pretty quickly as I began to realize life without him was so much better, I felt free to do what I want. I eventually got with my current bf (CB) which was friends with my best friend even though it was only about 5 days after me and James broke up. I told James about CB and Jamws got salty about it. He would sometimes call me and cry on the phone a lot, talking about his past and how that\u2019s what made him a bad boyfriend. I was also abused as a child, and I would never hit someone out of anger, but to make him feel better I would tell him he was a good bf etc( also I was scared he might threaten me as he did before saying how he knows where me and my family live). Our texts ended with him telling me I owe him 30$ for a charger which I ghosted because I realized I don't owe him shit.\n\n[This is how it is a lot of the times, almost anything can set him off. He get's mad and can't control his temper so he's shouts a lot. Most of the times I would cry because it's just my immediate reaction to extreme anger.](https://reddit.com/link/au4qxt/video/agxl6lt16gi21/player)\n\n**Afterword**..Late 2018, James dated a girl( let's call her Em) after me. Em and him broke up, and she connected with me and told me how she hated me because James would tell her how bad of a gf I was, that me and him were together for a year( which is a lie we were only together for 4 months), he bought me an engagement ring (another lie he never got me shit when he did like twice in our relationship he used his mom's money), and that I cheated on him(He cheated on my and try to turn me into the bad guy loool). He would even send her my nudes to make fun of me(revenge porn). Only after a few months of being with him Em realized James was all bullshit and James moved on and dated like 6 girls after Em. Some of other exes had repeated the same story: heavy manipulation, use of threats and suicide, and explosive anger. Fast forward to early 2019 my good friend Mike (one of the guy friends that James blocked on my phone) has a friend named Layla (Let\u2019s call her Layla), some 16\\* year old who is now dating James. Mike says he forgot the whole thing that happened between me and James and I tell him I will warn Layla. I tried to text her the whole story, but she called me instead pushing on me that we should all meet up (her, Mike, and me). I usually would NOT agree to this but Mike was a good friend of mine. I said sure and she set up the destination and time. I get there, and I text her that I'm there, she said she's on the way. 40 minutes passes and she's still not here. I text Mike asking where he or Layla is, Mike is confused because he didn't even know we were all meeting up apparently Layla made these plans and didn't even tell him even tho she said Nike was coming. I text her asking her ETA which she doesn't reply, I spend 20 minutes more waiting then I leave and gave her the benefit of the doubt that maybe something happened. I try to text her everything but she calls me and we FT for about and hour, I told her my story, and she was telling me all these red flags about how he makes her pay for everything etc. I felt good because I was able to warn someone and that person wouldn't have to fall into the same abuse that I had to face. Little did I know.. Just yesterday my friend Mike messages me telling me how Layla is moving in with James and how Layla is telling everyone I cheated and I said all these \"lies\" because I miss James and I want him back. I'm not even mad about Laula, even if she stood me up for an hour and is spreading lies about me because I know her staying and being with James is her own punishment. I was hoping she wouldn't have to go through that but sometimes we have to go through it to learn it. I hadn't been able to say the whole story out like this and I'm glad to get this off my chest as I kept quiet my entire relationship with him because I wanted to protect him. Thank you for those who read the whole thing as it was quite long, and to anyone who felt how I felt, scared, and thinking he can destroy you, you can do it, call the police, call your friends or family for help, don't let yourself be isolated and let this person control you and your life. Please, do something, don't let it get worse like I did. Especially if it involves a lot of illegal activities, report it, I was always afraid before and now I feel like it was too late as it happened in 2017, almost 2 years ago.\n\nupdate: Im really new to reddit and I just found out Im not supposed to put private information on reddit, I had already posted some names but I\u2019ll change them. I did not write this post as a witch-hunt for James, as I stated previously this is just warning/venting. I don\u2019t want to take down James\u2019s name because I feel that he doesnt deserve privacy and this could warn other girls who use Tinder or who just happen upon him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Im doing this on my phone. \n\nI remember when I got an IUD because I didnt want to take the pill anymore, we still had few sex because of the way he treated me. Always putting me down for small things, his rages and because I sometimes still had pain because my body wasnt yet used to the IUD. One time when we talked about the amount of sex we had he said that the IUD was a waste of money because he couldnt even USE it. It wasnt useful for him. \nI have to say we split the bill for the IUD. But still. Like I was just a toy there for him to fulfill his needs. He always said he needed sex to lessen his stress. And I needed intimacy for sex which was constantly destroyed by his behaviour. \n\nThinking back to this, I feel shame for not ending it that day. I was so in love and just couldnt believe he would mean such a thing. And he couldnt even understand why I was hurt. In the end he apologised for me feeling hurt. What a twisted way of saying. I cant believe I swallowed it. \n\nThe recent event was that he said \"fuck you\" at the end of a phone call in which I \"interrupted\" him. Though I thought he was finished talking and told him exactly that. When we later talked about it he wouldnt apologize but say we both messed up like me interrupting him is equal to him insulting me. And he even said he was right to say fuck you. When i disagreed he said, fine then its all cleared now and left the room. That was on valentines day. We didnt speak much for 2 weeks after that and now I finally broke up with him for good. I just couldnt stand it anymore. \n\nIm currently staying with friends until monday. He was so emotionless and cold when I told him it was over. It was almost scary. I left friday for the weekend and told him to think about how we could handle the situation. We just moved into a new apartment in a house with mutual friends. \n\nI still feel ashamed sometimes and am kind of relieved though, especially because I finally told my best friend everything about the relationship. Everything I held back so he wouldnt look like a bad guy. Which is so fucked up in the first place. I sometimes get sad because of the future I pictured for us and all the things I hoped he could be.

How can I know if the kindness and attention of a man is sincere? \nI will focus on myself now, I dont think I can be in a new relationship any time soon.\n\nI just want to thank all of you. This sub really opened my eyes and cleared the fog in my head so I couldnt lie to myself anymore about his behaviour. And I think he somehow felt he couldnt get the reactions he was used to. \n\nIm thankful though. I learned so much about this stuff and about myself.

N seem to be never satisfied with what they receive and they take intrusively.

My entire family is toxic but my N-dad is especially abusive (emotional, physical, ect.) My mom is an enabler with some passive aggressive tendencies and is dismissive towards mental health issues that I bring up with myself. \n\nFor a long time I was the golden child because I was very meek and never stood up for myself, so noone could picks fights with me (I kind of grey rocked for years before I even knew what it was.) I was very enmeshed with my parents and I used to think my family was fine. However, in recent years I have come out of denial about my family situation and realized how toxic it was. \n\nI have had long standing issues with suicidal depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. To the point where I would go for months without brushing my teeth or showering regularly, and I would wear the same dirty clothes almost everyday. I am starting to realize, through online resources like this sub and R/RBN that this is probably tied to the abuse I went through in my childhood.\n\nHowever, I have repressed most of my childhood.  Most of everything before my senior year in highschool is gone. I can remember bits and pieces, especially if someone else brings up a certain event. But I can't tell you about most of it, besides like very general things like where I lived or info about my friends. This is very troubling because I (trigger warning) suspect that was sexually abused when I was very young. I have been showing symptoms of someone who was molested, like hating people touching or my skin crawling when people looking at me, compulsively wearing bagging clothing that hide my body, being terrified of being alone in a room with someone (ect.). But since I have repressed most of my memories, I don't feel like I can say that I was a victim of sexual abuse.\n\nI feel like I am just faking it because I don't remember. That I am making it up and making myself feel this way. It tears me up inside to the point I break down in tears (which is rare because I am not a crier). Like I feel like I can't post in support groups like this because I cannot remember most of the abuse. Like despite the stuff I can remember that is highly suspect, I don't want to talk about it because I don't want to accuse these family members of being predators, idk. Can anyone else relate to this? Or am I just being weird?\n\n(Tl;dr) I show signs of an sexual abuse victim but I can't remember the abuse. I feel like I am making it up even though I have had significant periods of deep depression that seemed tied to this event.

I'm posting this really as encouragement to everyone feeling stuck. I felt like I was going to feel the same way forever but it really will shift at some point. \n\nI was speaking with my friend yesterday. I went through various incidents but it's been becoming clearer to me that, while the particular events are useful to explain to people some of what I was dealing with, the really damaging stuff for me was his constant attitude of superiority. How I constantly felt like I had to justify myself, like I wasn't quite smart enough, or cool enough, or interesting enough. You know, all of the things he flattered me with to begin with. Just a constant disdainful aloofness. And I fell for it. I treated him in my head like he was some kind of god. Like his judgment was right, and I was therefore always wrong. \n\nMy friend suggested I focus more on myself. This is something that I'd understood in theory. I had been spending so much of my time thinking about the N, why he is like he is, what I can do to get through to him etc. Somehow though, it seemed to get through on a deeper level this time, and I could see how I had given him so much psychological power over me. And while it is very sad he's like he is, my sympathy has been the door that he was able to use to gain control over me, whether he was conscious of that or not. It's taken me so long to get here because that feeling of being wrong, broken, mistaken had riddled its way so deeply into how I see myself. And to be honest, this was a wound that was already kind of open before he showed up to rub fucking caustic soda in it. But the switch flipped yesterday, and suddenly I can see very clearly what was going on.   \n\nPlainly put, anyone who is that condescending and arrogant towards *anyone* is not right! That in itself is an indication that something is very, very wrong. You should never feel like you're in a silent battle to prove yourself in a relationship. Your partner of all people should respect you and be a safe harbour for you to relax!   \n\nI know I still have a long way to go, but I feel such a sense of relief and hope right now.

I started with a personal trainer back in November &amp; I\u2019m well on my way to having my dream body. I\u2019m a great looking, dashing guy with good genetics, a full head of hair and so much heart. Yet, the past few weeks, the relationship with my nex gf has been blaring in my mind. Specifically, the discard. How sudden &amp; brutal it was, how she rubbed her new supply she had been grooming right under my nose for months straight into my face. They\u2019re engaged now. They have a shared interest (which is how they met), in which resides a very involved &amp; tight-knit community. \n\nI shouldn\u2019t feel this way, but I find myself once again asking if I was the problem. Had I been more involved in her passion, would she have stayed with me? Is she a narc at all? Or was I just not involving myself and showing interest the way a boyfriend should? The fact that she is already engaged to this guy blows my mind. And he has power and reputation in his position  that correlates to that activity they both engage in. He is renowned in that community. I fear that she truly found the love of her life and I just didn\u2019t give her what she needed. I feel like this is the guy she\u2019ll stay with forever, and I\u2019ll always be viewed as this \u2018angry, abusive\u2019 ex who hurt &amp; limited her. And him, the hero along with the maiden he rescued from the monster.\n\n\u2018Oh, she got her happily ever after! We  knew that monster she was with before was no good for her!\u2019\n\nThe thought of her complete detachment from me, her sheer disregard for the pain I was feeling when we still lived together those few weeks. How she tried to hide the fact that we had broken up and told me not to tell my family because she didn\u2019t want them to think differently of her. How she brought him home, how she tried to make me out to be this monster and acted like I shouldn\u2019t be upset by what she had done...\n\nI\u2019m just reeling, and I shouldn\u2019t be.

That said, I am not looking to date anybody right now, but it astounds me how no other woman I\u2019ve met strikes me like she did. She was the literal epitome of my dream girl, looks wise. Everything about her face, her (fabricated) mannerisms, her voice, her body, the way she moved, her ears, her eyes, her hair...her lips. It just isn\u2019t fair. If she is indeed this monster I believe her to be, it is the cruelest bait &amp; switch I\u2019ve ever heard of.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just ranting. Venting...seeking advice...I don\u2019t know.

At first, he was everything I needed. He was so sweet, thoughtful and kind. He motivated me to be my better self. But, quickly our relationship experienced so much turmoil. \n\nThere\u2019s things I can\u2019t forget. There are three sides to each story. Yours, theirs, and the truth. Mine was a lack of trust towards me. I slowly lost my friends. I slowly started to stop seeing my friends, doing the activities I enjoyed. I used to be surrounded by my closest friends. Now, I don\u2019t know the last time I\u2019ve seen most of them. Guy friends aren\u2019t in my vocabulary anymore. Girls night doesn\u2019t exist. If I were to say, \u201cI\u2019m going out with so-and-so and I\u2019ll be back after a bit,\u201d I would only be asking for trouble. Just last week I activated Facebook for several days (we deactivated our accounts because it caused too many unnecessary issues and fights) when he activated his, he accused me of trying to hide our relationship. I did put I was engaged, but he didn\u2019t believe me, so I showed him. The only thing I did was not include any photos of him in my profile page cover photos. I did this because when I looked at his page, I saw that he was still friends with this woman that he had a long term emotional relationship with, despite the fact that I thought he had deleted her.\n\nWhen he had this \u201cfriendship\u201d with her, it lasted almost a year. He kept mentioning her at random times, so I grew suspicious. I asked to see their messages, and he got upset and acted suspicious. Some messages were obviously deleted. I could tell because they were mid conversation. In the messages, there was a period that they talked while we were together, during a breakup, then when we got back together. I read many hurtful things. It was obvious she was just being nice, and had no romantic feelings. But he clearly had feelings for her. Some of the things he said were that I was a drug addict. I *used* to be an addict. I was sexually abused for several years by a family friend. During the same week of the court trial, I began using meth. I was fourteen years old and I was lost. Many years, before seeking therapy, I used many drugs. Another thing that was said was that I didn\u2019t support him when he lost his mother. I sat with him every single day during that period. I was at the hospital everyday with him. I picked a fresh handful of flowers everyday to set next to her bed. I stopped going to work and gave up my job to be there. I took long baths with him every night and massaged his legs and feet. I did my best to keep his spirits high, because I too have lost a parent. He said I don\u2019t help or support him with his autoimmune disease. I go with him to most of his appointments. I\u2019m adamant with his doctors about what he needs, I speak up when he\u2019s quiet and insure they provide him with what\u2019s needed. I call therapists in town to make sure he gets the needed care for his PTSD. I call the pharmacy to make sure he gets his medications. \n\nAround a two years ago, his ex messaged me on social media. She said he was sending her inappropriate things. I broke things off. He called her, and she recorded the call and sent it to me. It was so incriminating, and yet I convinced myself none of it was true, as did he, somehow. She eventually said she made it all up, but I still feel uneasy about all of it. When she said it was through email, I asked him if I could see the emails. He said there was nothing bad in them, and he deleted them because \u201che just deletes things.\u201d \n\nBefore he got on the necessary medication he needed, our fights were explosive. One of the most devastating things he had done was pulverize a house plant I saved from my father\u2019s funeral. Dirt, rocks, leaves and pieces of branches covered every surface. I spent *hours* cleaning it, crying uncontrollably as he sat upstairs mumbling mean things. I remember putting dustpans full of that plant in the garbage, and with every dustpan full of the plant, I felt I was throwing what was left of my father away. He\u2019s done many things, things he says he doesn\u2019t remember. Things blacked out during manic bipolar episodes. I admit I did things in return. I threw his collectible expensive graded Star Wars action figures out of spite. In return, there was some abuse turned at me. He didn\u2019t hit me. But I did get scared. I did get throw. There were bruises.\n\nDuring our breakups, I saw two men. Two rebounds each breakup. These get thrown in my face a lot. Yet, he saw god knows how many women. When we reconciled at one point, he insisted he saw nobody. Several times he told me, \u201cI couldn\u2019t. I wasn\u2019t able to because I love you too much and I just wasn\u2019t able to.\u201d Eventually, he admitted that he did see a women. He had sex with her several times. Then he said he met another women, but \u201cnothing happened.\u201d Then another, then another. \u201cNothing happened.\u201d He knows *everything* that happened with me during our times apart. I don\u2019t know anything except what he tells me.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the last load of laundry he\u2019s done. He hates my OCD. He says it\u2019s out of control. But, all I want to really do is make the bed everyday. If I don\u2019t, it causes me a great deal of anxiety and throws my entire day off. I find myself taking more and more of my anxiety medication everyday, just to numb myself through the day. To make me feel a little euphoric when I feel so depressed and alone. I do so much for him. I cook, I clean, I do almost everything by myself.\n\nEvery time I get *so* close to ending it, I feel this fear. I have no license, I\u2019m afraid of how I\u2019ll get to my appointments a half an hour out of town. How will I pick up my meds? How will I get to work? Then I think of the nice moments. When he\u2019s cute, fun and silly. Will I regret leaving him?\n\nLast week he said he\u2019s sick of the lack of sex. That it starts the same way, ends the same way. It\u2019s grown \u201ccomplacent,\u201d he says. First, he was prescribed antidepressants that lowered his sex drive. Then I developed health issues (ovarian cysts, possible endometriosis and a tight pelvic bowl(?) my doctor said. Now I\u2019m on a medication that\u2019s lowered my sex drive. I asked him if things didn\u2019t change, would he leave me or look elsewhere? And he grew quiet. I took this as a warning, and started being more intimate, but I have no interest in doing so. Partly because  of the pain, partly because of my medication, and partly because the way he makes me feel. I feel as though he thinks so less of me.\n\nI was a bit sexually explorative years ago. I had a threesome one time. He *hates* this fact, and brings it up often. He asked me how many partners I\u2019ve had, and I told him. It\u2019s not an outrageous amount, but to him it is. He said, \u201cwow, that\u2019s like, an entire classroom.\u201d It made me feel disgusting. The way I see it, is that I\u2019m nearly thirty years old. I\u2019ve seen a lot of things, I\u2019ve experienced a lot of things. But, it\u2019s not how many I\u2019ve slept with to me, it\u2019s how many I haven\u2019t. Not to sound conceded, but I\u2019m a good looking woman. I\u2019m attractive, have a nice figure, a lot of flattering tattoos, a nice figure. I used to get hit on quite a bit. But, I don\u2019t just open my legs. I do have self respect. If I had found a connection with someone, I would be intimate with them.\n\nHe stopped buying flowers or surprising me a long time ago. He said, \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t feel like you deserve it because I feel replaceable.\u201d Well, maybe make it feel less easily that you are replaceable. Make me feel more prioritized. Make me feel loved, appreciated. He\u2019s made so many promises, all left and dissipated. \n\nI deserve better. I want to be happy. I\u2019m so unhappy. He\u2019s not the man he was when I met him. He\u2019s done so many things I can\u2019t seem to forget or forgive. He\u2019s lost motivation to improve himself, or be an equal partner. \n\nRight now, we\u2019re living with my mother. I\u2019m the one actively looking for a home. I\u2019m the one setting up times to view homes, I\u2019m the one sending the emails, I\u2019m the one making the calls. I\u2019m the one trying. I\u2019m the one that filed my taxes, which I\u2019m receiving a good amount, which will get us a decent place. But, he won\u2019t file his. This would help so much, even if it\u2019s just several hundred. At the moment, we have no money *at all*. \n\nOne thing that\u2019s also bothered me is that I lost my benzodiazepine prescription a while back due to a suicide attempt. I have *severe* anxiety. I ended up buying Xanax from people to get by. During that time, I was drinking, and took Xanax. I was around a trusted childhood friend. I passed out and I was raped. After that I lost all care for myself. I even married a man I barely knew. I couldn\u2019t figure out the divorce papers on my own. The depression didn\u2019t help either. I married this man at my rock bottom. He died of an overdose last year. He\u2019s upset that I\u2019m still friends with him on a social media site, despite the fact that he\u2019s dead. It got so bad I was taking 12-20mg a day. During withdrawal I experienced a seizure. Recently, I had an oral surgery and received pain medication. Before the surgery, he hid his pills (despite the fact that in the past he\u2019s actually been the one to steal pills from me) but after I received a ten pill supply of pain meds, he was eager to trade me Xanax for some. Yet before he was scared to have Xanax around me because of my past with them? I gave him a few anyways. It feels as though his feelings are *always* more important than mine. It feels as though how  I feel about anything doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nI don\u2019t receive valentines gifts. Birthday gifts. For Valentine\u2019s Day, I borrowed money to take him out to dinner. I bought him some valentines candy. Our anniversary was just some days before that, I thoughtfully wrote him a long thoughtful letter. He didn\u2019t do anything in return. \n\nAm I wasting some of the most important years of my life trying to make this work? Can we improve our relationship? Am I settling out of fear because I\u2019ve grown comfortable, and I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t succeed on my own again? Sometimes I feel like I\u2019m crazy, and I believe part of that is due to his gaslighting. But that thought even makes me feel crazy. I\u2019m a good woman. I\u2019m not perfect. My past is not perfect. But I\u2019m strong, I\u2019m motivated, I\u2019m supportive, and I didn\u2019t make it this far to feel so unworthy. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

From age 2(the earliest I can remember) to age 24(my current age) my parents have been the most carefully and deliberately abusive people I've ever heard of. I've read resources on child abuse and all of them say that often times the parent isn't even aware of what they're doing to their children, but that isn't what happened to me. My parents would outright say things that, had they been implied, would have been abusive. \"Your priority should never be on making you happy, you need to make us happy first.\" \"It's okay that we care about ourselves, because we like us.\" \"You're a disappointment and I wish the effort we put into you as a child went into someone who deserved it.\" \"Your identity as a person needs to be based on what we want you to be, not what you want.\" \"The only difference between a child and a pet is that one sub-human can bring you happiness now, and the other brings you happiness when they graduate school and get a job.\" To make matters worse, trying to say no to this condition was met with various kinds of physical torture. Forcing us to perform meaningless labor until we dropped from exhaustion, kicking us, and forcing us to pick ourselves back up and continue, keeping us on the edge of starvation to the point that we'd fistfight over scraps, not permitting us to sleep until we said whatever was demanded of us. Forcing my three siblings and I to play games of politics against each other, so that no one of us could trust the others, and having us partake in the continued torture of those we beat in these games. Playing with our sense of reality until the one thing that remained stable was them, up to and including loss of the privilege of a name, regressing the punished child to being addressed as such. Randomly turning the water heater off during showers and forcing us to shower together. Forcing me to go on boy scout campouts with my father and brother even though I was never a scout and ended up spending a weekend sleeping in a tent and showering with my dad away from everyone else so i wouldn't \"distract the scouts\". Being forced to tell my mother each and every time I masturbated so I could be shamed for it. Certain words were instilled in us as panic triggers. Whenever we heard the word \"choice\", it meant punishment was coming and that we would be suffering very shortly. My father liked to use it to get us to fawn over him, making sure his need for another soda or some odd chore was met. He liked to mess with all our heads that way. The other word that comes to mind is \"independent\" which was meant to make us feel small and vulnerable, i.e. feeling like we could never live without the support of our parents. I had the nerve to ask about these triggers once, and my father said that it was about making sure we knew our place. So now I hear about this concept of parental affection and I think about the people that forced peanut butter down the throat of a ten year old, and forced the same bite down twice when she spit it up the first time. I think about the man that threatened us with caging if we kept getting in the way of him. I think of all the hundreds of little other things that barely register as painful anymore, and I just wonder why they'd do this to us. ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

So on to the story...\n\nI met Rinko (not her real name) in 2016 when we were still in university. To give a little background, we were blockmates back then (it's a group of students with the same course that have the same schedule for all subjects/classes that need to be taken according to the curriculum). We became close after we got to talking about our lives and I found out that she had a really rough home life. She would sometimes attend classes with several bruises on her legs and would tell everyone that she just fell down the stairs or tripped on a sidewalk or any accident that she could think of. When I knew what she was going through, I became protective of her. I always tried to catch up with her and ask about how she's doing. So we became close after that. \n\n\nIn 2017, one of our blockmates and one of her close friends, Lon (not his real name too) expressed interest in Rinko. He told everyone that he had a crush on her and it was for a good reason. Rinko is smart and funny. She topped exams even when she told me that the night before, her mother was strangling her (this is because her mother blamed her for the death of a younger sibling who was run over by a car when they were still super young). I thought she was doing very well despite all of that. She still talked to me about suicide and depression but never really gave anything away other than being really lonely. I supported her and told her that if she ever wanted to seek professional help, that I would accompany her. But she didn't think she needed it.\n\n\nRecently, she started opening up about her budding relationship with Lon.  She told me that she was annoyed that he would only want to take long walks with her at night after working and that he didn't take her out on fancy dinner dates. I thought this was just a miscommunication on their part. So I told her to tell him how she feels about all of those things so that there can be a compromise. I thought it was just a silly problem and something that can be easily solved through proper communication. \n\n\nYesterday, another close friend of mine talked to me about Lon. She told me that he opened up on what was happening between him and Rinko and I was truly shocked to know the truth. He showed her text messages of Rinko when they were fighting telling him to go online on Messenger or else his family will die. Another message read \"I hope your mother had you aborted instead\" and another read \"I wish your whole family will die! Along with your stupid dog!\". She even told me a story when Lon got a new phone and Rinko immediately snatched it from him and asked for the password. When he didn't give it to her, she punched him in the face. Then asked again. Lon tried to take away the phone but when Rinko got mad, she threw the phone on the street and repeatedly broke it until it was no longer working. \n\nWhen Lon went home, his whole family found out what happened with his phone. They thought it was run over by a truck. So the whole family went to Rinko's place and demanded an apology and payment for the phone. She paid for it but asked for forgiveness repeatedly. Lon's mother didn't want to accept the apology but Lon's sisters and father gave Rinko a second chance. They invited her to dinner after that. But when the dinner was over, Rinko told Lon that the dinner was \"disgusting\" and that she thought it tasted like \"dog food\". Lon also had several marks from being pinched hard by Rinko. There were a lot of clear cases of physical and verbal abuse as well as manipulation to Lon. My close friend also told me that the only reason they were able to talk was because Lon ignored Rinko's attempts to stop him from seeing his friends and Rinko's threats for him to die. Also, when Lon tried to leave Rinko, she threatened suicide. A lot of these and more happened to Lon and I really feel awful for him.\n \n\nNow, I know that Rinko has always told Lon that I was the only one who understood her(but not to this extent!). I know that because she says so in her stories. Also, Lon doesn't want to talk to me about Rinko because he thinks I'll be biased. My friends told me that they think I'm the only one who can talk some sense to Rinko but I know this is something that's going to require professional help. Lon has already decided to stop talking to Rinko but she has been going crazy, calling him almost non stop for the whole day. I'll admit that I am quite unsure how to approach Rinko about this. She did tell me just now that she was hurting that Lon \"broke up\" with her and that she was so sad. I tried to reason with her that it's better for her to let him go, that she can just focus on herself for now. I told her again that we should go see a psychiatrist instead to help her sort out her feelings. She then told me that she wants to commit suicide again. I don't know how to talk to her anymore after this. I honestly had no idea about this side of her because she has always been nice to me and has never made me feel bad in our entire friendship. So now I'm at a loss on how I should go about this whole situation. I don't want to just drop out of her life because of this since she's suicidal. \n\n\nTl;dr: My college best friend opened up to me about her relationship with a friend, I thought they had miscommunication problems. Turns out she was abusing and manipulating the guy. I'm now unsure how to help her.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

She always told stories about my father and baby stories of me.\n\nThis is where things turn. She did end up coming when I was 10, which was incidentally right around when my dog died, so I was crushed since my dog was my only support system and kids in my class were bullying me because my dog died. I was a chubby kid(bigger bodytype, it will be important later), and my sister was skinny, I\u2019m a size 12 now and she\u2019s a size 2, and got a lot of bullying for that too, so I was and am still very insecure about my body type.\n\nWhen my grandmother came, she stayed in my sisters room since she had the biggest room of us all. One day I came home completely crushed after being bullied at school and decided to talk to Mary about it, she said that it\u2019s not like I\u2019d make it anywhere anyway, what would it matter if i was being bullied if I was destined for the gutter, needless to say I was crushed, the last person in my family I could have trusted in my family spat my trust in my face.\n\nI\u2019d like to say that was it, but it wasn\u2019t, my grandmother gave me rants on my worthlessness before I\u2019d go to school, and then reprimand me for anything she could when I got home, including a particular instance where she punished me for holding my own toy(no context needed, i came home crushed and wanted something to hold on to) and yelled at me, saying that people like me were the reason my generation would never make it anywhere, and when I cried because I was yelled at, she would yell at me for crying. I ended up developing an eating disorder because food was the only comfort that I could find, making my weight another issue, whenever I took more food, Mary would yell at me later for being \u2018fat\u2019, and how I was a waste of space.\n\nBecause my sister didn\u2019t get bullied at school for having my dog die, or the bullying because of size, or any of the issues I had with Mary, I believed her, I have worked hard for years to shed my extra weight, and I now have problems with manic depression and anxiety along with the remnants from my disorder. I didn\u2019t tell anyone this happened because I had similar problems with my parents and was severely bullied at school, so I assumed everyone\u2019s home was like this and only found out about 2 years ago that that\u2019s not true.\n\nSo that\u2019s my story, sorry for such a long post :| , It needs context to make sense, if you have questions I\u2019ll try and answer them, thanks in advance for helping me out. \n\n", "subreddit": "abuse"}

You made me feel special, like I was the most beautiful girl in the world. And I believed you. Maybe you do still love me, but there is only so much that one person's heart can take. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou are an alcoholic, which you did not disclose to me when I met you. Why would you? You were only trying to portray an image of yourself that you thought I would fall in love with. I watched you throw furniture across your apartment and punch holes in the walls because I was angry with you for leaving work to binge drink until you passed out, and like an idiot, I still stayed. Your dog bit me in the face and drew blood while I was yelling at you for being an alcoholic, and I still stayed, even though I was terrified.  I stayed because I THOUGHT that I was really in love with you and that you would change for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext came the emotional abuse. It started gradually. I would disagree with you over something small and trivial, and it would end in you accusing me of cheating when I did absolutely nothing to deserve it. I have never cheated on anyone, even when I was cheated on, and I was entirely open with you about everything I did. I don't even go out or have guy friends. It always started for the most ridiculous reason, like me being unhappy at work. I still have trouble trying to wrap my head around how me disagreeing with you about walking out on my job could end in you accusing me of cheating. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou would also sometimes tell me to go f somebody else if I wasn't happy, all while I was sitting there putting up with your bullshit, because I somehow believed that you were the perfect person for me.

You told me that I wasn't paying off my student loans fast enough, that I wasn't saving up for a car fast enough, and that I never wanted to build a future with you. We talked about the future all the time, so this was a blatant lie. We had plans to move to a beach town when you had a better job and you could support me for a few months. When we met, you said to me that I was smart for living at home because I'd be able to pay down my debt faster. I'm not sure where your new ideas came from. You contradicted almost every single thing you had told me and agreed with me about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI declined moving in with you because I couldn't afford it, and because I didn't want to live with a dog that attacked me.

You refused to find another apartment because it was \"too hard\" and you claimed that the police wouldn't help you get rid of her. I'm pretty sure that you weren't even trying. You also didn't even remember your dog attacking me because you were so damn drunk. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the worst parts of all of this is that during every argument, you'd say, \"I don't know why you always pull this shit with me\" when all I did was tell you that I felt differently about something, and you turned it into a huge, emotionally draining fight. I never once went out of my way to hurt you the way that you hurt me. You would insult me, insult my family, and insult the way that I was living my life. You took the most sensitive parts of me and twisted your knife into them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn hindsight, I don't even know why I stayed with you for this long. You made yourself out to be a sweet and loving man who wanted to take care of me and helped me achieve my goals, when in reality, you're a raging alcoholic and an emotional abuser. Whether you love me or not, I can no longer go on like this. I can't date someone who keeps me walking on eggshells and who makes me feel like it's my fault. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI might cry over you because I'm mourning the person who I thought you were, but I'll never go back.

This is my second time opening up about this, the first being to one person who told me the guy did something similar to her when I brought up who did my work.\n3 years ago I got my arm tattoo. I was so excited to start such a big piece of work and for such a great price. I met him through my step mom, he's her nephew and a well known/reputable artist. So when he had a Christmas deal I was more than happy to put my deposit down. Planning the tattoo was all fine and great, mostly messenger. We met at a Christmas gathering and that was when I put down the deposit. That was when he asked to add me on Snapchat. I thought whatever, its just another way to see his work. Then the compliments started coming in. \"You're so beautiful.\" \"I wish I could be the one you get to cuddle.\" I thought, whatever its just another guy getting his last flirts in before his son is born. Time goes on and its finally tattoo day!!! I cant be more excited, I loved the images drawn up for me and I was ready to go to his home, as that's how he was able to offer work for less than $100 an hour. I thought, it's just so he can make extra money on the side for Christmas, and he can't compliment me if we're at home with his girlfriend and then newborn. I get there and he starts getting the work area ready. We're set up in the middle in between his living room/kitchen/dining area. We start the tattoo and all is fine. Then he gets to my forearm. He asks me to position myself so my arm is straight and slightly lowered, with hand half clenched and pulled down, so that the skin of my forearm is tight. He's wearing basketball shorts and throughout the whole section of this tattoo he's scooting forward. I can feel him putting his genitals against/in my hand. He starts adjusting his junk in between forced grabs. This went on for a while. What am I supposed to do? He drove me. He's in the middle of a tattoo I already paid for. His girlfriend and son are in the other room. Would anyone even believe me??? I could tell when he finished. He said \"oops, these basketball shorts don't fit, my dick fell out haha\" and from then on he rushed my tattoo and barely said a word to me. I went home, excited to finally have started such a big piece of work. I said nothing about the abuse. I went to bed and I could still feel his genitals forcing their way into my hand. I can hear him repeatedly telling me \"like this\" and showing me how to hold my hand/arm. I kept seeing him on my facebook, Snapchat, and hearing about him from my step mom. A few weeks later he's messaging me. Telling me his girlfriend and him have an arrangement, and he would love to have a side piece, as his girlfriend has a girlfriend. I tried as politely as I could to decline and eventually unfriended him. Now I had to find a new tattoo artist. 3 years later I'm talking with an old friend about our tattoos. She asks who did it, and when I tell her she simply responds with \"ew.\" She then tells me how he also said the same things to her. When planning her tattoo, she asked if her boyfriend could come. He said no because he \"didn't want that energy in the room while he tattoos.\" I told her how he said the same things to me (minus the boyfriend part) and it all came flooding back. I realized how repressed it was until that moment. It was like he was forcing himself in my hand again. It was like the first night I went to bed after, all I could feel was him. Before now I never wanted to think about it or speak about it. Now I wish I would have filed a report or never stepped in that door. There's so much trust that goes in to tattoo work and he's out here taking advantage of my trust, a friend's trust, and god knows how many other young girl's trust. But it's too late now and I'm ready to move on with another artist. Its been 3 years since I've gotten a tattoo and I'm finally ready to start doing what I love again. Thank you to everyone who read this big pile of mess but its been great to vent. And if you know any tattoo artists that can help me out with a vibrant realistic ocean scene in Pierce County Washington, let me know!", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Maybe?", "author": "Lixynel", "self_text": "First post, never even really used reddit at all until my current girlfriend so this is all pretty new. As a quick warning there will be a lot of I don\u2019t knows in this. I don\u2019t know a lot about what happened and I don\u2019t know if I want to know. I don\u2019t know where to turn so this was what my early morning, tired ass brain thought was a good idea. \n\nI think I was molested as a child. I\u2019ll first go over some relevant set up. My biological father was a cunt. He was addicted to sleeping pills and was an alcoholic. He hit my mother and broke glass. I remember my mom telling me to hide in my room by a dresser, that\u2019s it I don\u2019t know why or context but I think that has some implications of its own. They divorced when I was maybe 6 or 7 and I saw him at a park for 10 minutes and left never seeing him again. No contact as we moved a state away and he just moved on to the next poor woman. I am sure I have many half brothers and sisters I will never meet. After that it was over I don\u2019t remember feeling anything about this and moved in with my mothers parents and went to kindergarten the following year. For reference I am 17 now. Now for the fun part.\n\nI\u2019ll tell what I know, or what I think I know. I vividly remember talking to a police officer  on my dining room table with my mother there. She had red hair and had a fuller body, the police officer. I don\u2019t remember the conversation other than where did he touch you? I remember prior to this going alone with my bio. fathers parents on a trip. I remember being in a motel type place with a basket ball court. I wanted to go down and play there I think. So my grandmother (not meaning to imply I think of her as my family, but for simplicity\u2019s sake I\u2019ll call his parents grandmother and grandfather) went to a vending machine to get donuts. The white powder ones, as I remember, and I was with my grandfather on the balcony walkway to go to the basketball court, but we never went down there. That\u2019s all, regarding this \u201ctrip\u201d, that I remember. \n\nNow these by themselves are not damning, maybe I remembered wrong or I\u2019ve fabricated this, but there\u2019s more after the fact. The only time something of this has been brought up within my family was when my adopted father (pretty good guy, has faults but who doesn\u2019t) made an off hand comment while talking about my mother that she\u2019s protective because my boi fathers father was a pedophile/ molester. \nI\u2019ve always thought about the trip and police incidents throughout my life but I never understood them. I knew what the implication was but I didn\u2019t tell anyone and forgot about it. Never asked my mother. And haven\u2019t had any depression or anxiety as a result, to my knowledge. I thought about it intensely about three years ago, though. I then started feeling ashamed and embarrassed about being a rape victim. Even though I didn\u2019t even know if it really happened. So to try and understand it I did what any reasonable person would do and turned to talking to pedophiles on the internet. What happened is not important but more the action. I just played along, I knew they were grooming me but I was in control the whole time. I never got in big trouble and I\u2019m over that now but I did it for a while and I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m starting to think it might be related. \n\nNow to the point I\u2019m thinking about maybe trying to go to my hometown and looking for police reports when I turn 18. I don\u2019t know if this is a good idea though. I\u2019m not worried about what I\u2019ll find but what if I made it up. What if I\u2019m a liar and got this man in trouble for no reason. What if it never happened. And what if it did. The only person I\u2019ve ever told about what I think I remember and the surrounding relevant information is my current girlfriend. I\u2019m pretty trusting and open once I get to know someone. I told her this pretty much as a joke. Most of my humor is \u201cdark\u201d and \u201cdry\u201d. She told me about her self harm scars. Nothing too serious and she\u2019s much better know and not likely to go back to doing anything destructive. But I sarcastically said \u201cThat\u2019s nothing, I was raped as a child.\u201d She didn\u2019t believe me at first. After I explained, and oh so humorously joked about molestation and self harm within a month of dating an absolutely gorgeous girl, she said that\u2019s fucked and she\u2019s so sorry. The reason for me telling this is that my demeanor and response was that if a joke. I didn\u2019t make it a big deal even to myself. I didn\u2019t have any emotion towards it and so I\u2019m not afraid of finding out the truth. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m writing this. Maybe to get it off my chest or for attention. I really can\u2019t tell. As I guess the theme of this is I don\u2019t know it\u2019s fitting really. Maybe someone can help or give advice on what to do going forward. I am a little worried about it if it is true. I don\u2019t know how to be a rape victim or molester victim or whatever. Kidding, of course, or maybe not. \n\nAnyways, thank you for reading if you did and have a good rest of your day. ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I wanted to give sufficient context to my plight.\n\nI am a 19 year old male, born into a family with sufficient income. I have left a domestic abuse situation, one which covered everything except sexual abuse and blatant physical assault. My entire life has been one of much isolation and increasing psychological abuse and manipulation. My father was very controlling and kept the entire family in a vice grip, justifying his unusual and damaging actions as head of the house by saying it was what God told him to do. Apparently God told him to never get medical service unless someone is literally about to die (this includes not getting my sister the proper psychiatric help for her severe OCD) avoid getting a water heater after it broke long ago, allow next to no outside real-world contact, etc.\n\nMy brother, whom I left my situation with, is in his mid twenties, and he has had no avenue of escape, much like me. We were never offered the opportunity to grow and gain real world experience, nor get a job to earn money. We were forced to become drastic and were even able to get police officers to drive us to a shelter (though they didn\u2019t seem too convinced of our situation; they kept asking us why we didn\u2019t just leave, despite us telling them we had no way to leave).\n\nWe were able to find much more suitable living conditions after we were in contact with an agency that specialized in domestic abuse. It is a little emasculating, being a 19 year old male in a situation mostly females come from. But in any case, the agency is helping us get food stamps, licenses, GEDs, and jobs. I am in a sort of mental crisis, however, because the more I explain my situation to the people here, the more things they say were abuse.

Its a very long story, even with skipping a lot of parts. This is my entire life story as a rant because im mad about the thing that happened today. This all started seventeen years ago tho so... yep get some popcorn and im pissed\n\nSkip to end for short version\n\n\nThe first part of this story is what i remember to the best of my knowledge from a few memories i have of left of this time that were horrible.\n\nMy mother accidentally got pregnant with me when i was little and lied to my dad and said she had a miss carriage until she was past the time to have an abortion. Just under a year after i was born she ran away with me to her boyfriends house and they got married. We lived in a small apartment with his own daughter, i was so young i dont even remember her name. She would kick me and scream at me to stop crying after. When this began i was made to sleep in a crib in my mother and her husband at night. I always had to sleep on one particular side so they could \u201cdo the do\u201d without me watching. According to my mother if i didnt he would slap me. I was a baby and she had no reason to lie. \n\nAbout a year or so after they divorced and we lived with my grandma (mom\u2019s side) but i dont remember that part but one with a cat. \nAbout another year later we moved to a college campus and told no one, not even my father or anyone else in my family. I must have been about 2 or 3 \nmy dad and her werent married so she was able to demand child payments which is what we lived off of for the first years of my life (she didnt have a job, and she was at school all day) we moved multiple times to hide from my father after she would allow him to see me to get money from him. \n\nShe told me he didnt want me, he hated me, and that he tried to kill himself when he found out she was pregnant (sadly this was partially true and i found out later). I didnt believe her because i thought she was the crazy one.\nThis began when i was about 3. \n\nWe moved all the time so we never unpacked any of our stuff. She packed everything together cause she was always rushing, so a lot of our things would be mixed. All the time shed have to go through all of my stuff to get to hers, shed carefully go through one box at a time getting sloppier and sloppier until she got so frustrated shed just empty the box upside down all over the floor. This happened almost every day, and every day she would scream at me to put everything back in the boxes (and she expected me to sort them so she didnt have to do it later again) and would sit there watching me do it and would scream at me if i stopped (this was a bunch of little tiny things in giant boxes, i was three years old it took me some time when it was all over the floor) she never told me how to sort anything, and i always did it wrong some how. Or something would always happen and id get distracted because i was young or there would be so much crap id want to play with.\nIf i stopped shed scream at me, shed sometimes sneak around the corner and watch me playing with things instead of cleaning after she trashed my room again, then after a bit shed sneak up behind me and scream at me as loud as she could about being an idiot and yank my hair and sometimes slap me. I know this is when i was about 4-5 because this is when we moved twice in the same apartment complex. \nHer violence escalated when i began elementary school about a year after this happened (i am right at the cut off age point i started a year ahead)\nShe became lazier, she wouldnt do the dishes, she made me, shed play video games or watch tv and make me SWEEP her CARPET when we had a vacuum and she would speak to me in this mocking voice about how \u201cif you clean faster you can eat dinner later\u201d \nShe never let me.\nShed pile up dishes for a week, all microwave food she taught me how to make for her. If i was caught eating without permission i would be hit and kicked until i was screaming and begging her to stop. The neighbors called the cops so many times. \nSometimes it was days before shed let me eat or i would sneak food sometimes, but she would always find out and beat the crap out of me. \n\nTo sum this part up She barely let me eat at all and i couldnt grow when i was little now im fucking 5\u20191\u201d because of her.\n\nThis made it hard to do dishes because i was tired because of school and always weak and dizzy and sick. So id take a long time to do a weeks worth of dishes. She had school and so did i, so id go to a day care center, go to school, then another day care center while my mom did god knows what and id get home at 8 pm.\nThis is when everything became truly violent. \nShe would go to bed at night and id stay up doing the dishes. Id be exhausted so id have to sit down every once in a while on the chair i had to stand on to reach the sink. If she caught me she would scream at me and stand there with her arms crossed all mad like and watch me do the dishes until she got tired and left. Id finish them all, then usually go to bed\nSometimes i wouldnt finish. Id be too tired. Id sit on the chair for a sec and then fall asleep. Then id really get it in the morning. I remember she began keeping me home from school, she would scream \u201cWHAT DID I TELL YOU TO DO\u201d and once sprayed me in the eyes with clothing stain remover. \n\nI went blind for a week\n\nThis continued every day and night for years, i did everything for her, i cleaned, i brought her stuff in the shower, i did the dishes i made her food and i became a master at sneaking food. \n\nMy dad finally took her to court to get visitation and me, my mom, and her new boyfriend all moved to a new apartment about half an hour away from my dad. My mom didnt enroll me in the third grade until halfway into the semester and i would lie to my dad and say i had a great time at school. \nVisitation was rough, they began criticizing everything about me immediately when i would get to their house (my dad lived with his mother at the time)\nI didnt know how to act with them and they took all of my questions as \u201cattitude.\u201d They would tell my mother i was rude to them and she would scream at me after they left. \n\nThis was the norm for a while \nThen she got pregnant\n\nOne time well before this at some point she was about to hurt me and i shut my bedroom door at just the right time that she fell and damaged the cartilage in both of her knees (she had periods of time when she would be reasonable and kind and sweet and apologize and she would cry and hold me and told me to run to my room and lock it when she was upset) \nShe was always in pain after that, and while pregnant with my baby sister she took some pain medicine she wasnt supposed to while pregnant, and my sister became sick when she was a year old. Guess who cleaned up all the vomit.\nSome after my sister was born and i was enrolled in school finally, i broke my pinky after i fell into a gym room door and it got caught in the hinges as it was closing. My mom decided that was the perfect day to test the new stroller and walk to come get me, even though she had a new car from her dad. \n\nOne night we got in an argument. My mom was drunk, she had the baby in her arms after i cleaned up her vomit again and changed her diaper and fed her. She was cooing over her and playing with her, making her make cute faces. She was drinking and noticed me sneaking into the kitchen to get food. She put the baby down and grabbed me by my hair and dragged me over to the wall by my room and started hitting and kicking me screaming \u201cwhat did i tell you\u201d over and over. She told me nothing. I couldnt stop crying so she put her hand over my mouth and nose so i couldnt breathe. I bit her as hard as i could and she started screaming at me and hitting me. Then she got the lighter. \nThis repeated a few times this week, then the last day i was with her she forced me to drink alcohol too. I dont remember a lot that happened until the police got there thankfully. \nRumpleminz isnt as christmas-y when youre eight years old\n\nI know the neighbors finally got fed up with my screaming and called the cops. I remember finally telling the cops the truth after 8 years\nI hadnt showered or slept in days and i was up until 3 am that night. \nI found out i was gonna go to my dads house and passed out\n\nI had then had visitation of my mother for a while, and every day was the same with my dad. Him and his mom werent expecting someone as broken as me. I ate everything and my grandma told me id get fat and that i should be proud of how skinny i am. My dad said nothing and stayed in his room every day and ignored me.\n\nSometimes when i was with my mom she would make me sit in in the dark bathroom with the lights off if she was mad at me and watch the door to see if i got scared enough to turn the light on. Then id get another bruise. \nMy dad couldnt comprehend my fear of the dark as a third grader (HOW IMMATURE) and they have forced me to sleep with my door closed and light off ever since. \nMy mom used sleep as a reward that happened like every other day. I would rarely be allowed to sleep, so when i was allowed to with my dad, id get yelled at for not waking up on my own at 10 am. \nThey criticize every little thing about me, my grades (school wasnt exactly my thing but i wasnt getting into trouble.) i wasnt allowed to have friends that were boys, but i didnt know how to be a girl, so guys were easier to talk to. \nWith my mother there were some times she would be loving and caring and i knew she wasnt herself all the other times when she was cruel.\n\n\nWith my new family, there is never even a split second when i can feel real love from them. Every since i went to live with them they have always criticized me for everything i h said or done. They constantly say i ruined their lives and anything that goes wrong for them is usually my fault anyways so i guess its true. \nMy dad and i eventually moved out and i lived with him and his girlfriend for a while, same arguments every day no matter what. \nThey couldnt stand me. They told me every day i was ruining their life and so id go to my grandma\u2019s. she was he same way but worse. She would make comments about my appearance and when id defend myself id get screamed at and sent back to my dads. \nThey began finding what i now know were ptsd triggers for me and when i told them why it bothered me when i did those things (cause of my mom) they would tel me to get over it or even accuse me of lying. They accused me of lying all the time because my triggers would happen during arguments and id tell them and theyd think i was using it to get out of the argument. \nA huge problem i had after the first year of living with them was sleeping at night. If he caught me awake hed scream at me. I wasnt allowed to keep my phone in my bedroom and every night my dad would go through it. \nEventually i utilized my old my sneaking capabilities and snuck in to the kitchen every night to get my phone and began talking to people so i could relax and fall asleep.\nI met a boy named named brandon (dont laugh this is sad) online and we managed to date in secret online for three years. He had gone through very similar things with his dad and we connected instantly. We had an argument ONCE because i had been contemplating suicide and i said to him \u201ci dont think life is for me\u201d i wish he had taken his own advice from that night. We planned to get married\nMy father was dating a girl he met on warframe, and they had known each other for three months before she moved in from Tennessee- ten hours away\nI had known brandon for 3 years, he was from michigan. \nMy father did not let me attend his funeral last may. \nAfter this everything went downhill. I told a friend i was going to kill myself one night and he called the cops, i now have a $4000 hospital bill to pay off, i graduated half a semester early, i have a full time job and i pay the required amount each month. Its never enough for them\nOn top of this after my brandon died my ptsd came through full force and i started having vision problems. They took me to my eye doctor who told em to go to my pediatrician who told em to go to a social worker and the psychiatrist who recommended me here. \nMy grandma has recently become  more violent and accusatory. I have something called postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome that makes me faint and get dizzy and a whole bunch of other terrible stuff, on top of the new meds i was finally taking after 6 years of begging to be seen by a psychiatrist because i was sad all the time, i wasnt feeling that great one day. I started to faint and i tripped over my dogs dish. (Yes they love her more btw but thats understandable cause i do too)\nWhen i tripped i put a hole in my wall. This was after an argument so they think its on purpose. I was barely even able to stand at the time cause i was so dizzy.\nThis was three months ago.\n\n\nToday slept in until 1 pm today (door shut not bothering anyone.) and my grandma comes pounding at my door and screams \u201cDID YOU CUT MY REFRIGERATOR WITH A KNIFE\u201d \nI was confused??\nI get up half asleep and i go look. Theres a long hardly noticeable scratch going from the top of the fridge to the bottom, clearly deliberate.\nI havent been home the past few nights because i was at my current boyfriend\u2019s house. My grandpa was out of state. \nBut apparently i tried to murder my refrigerator with a broken paring knife that just happened to be laying on the top of the trash.\n\n(Also at this point i have been NC with my mother for 7 years. And i just know a bit about her from her ex fianc\u00e9 who stalked me, then threatened to hurt my sisters if i didnt send him nude photos of myself or if i told someone. What i did do was really stupid but we wont discuss that here (nothing illegal).\n\nTo sum it all up:\nMy mom basically tortured and literally tried to kill me but was nice sometimes\nMoved in with dad and grandma\nTheyre both assholes but not violent\nWorse mental state than with my mom because absolutely no support ever.\nUse me as their scapegoat for everything\nWant me to buy them a new fridge for a tiny scratch i did while at another person\u2019s house, even though i have a hospital bill for almost killing myself that i can already barely afford because i literally just graduated from highschool three months ago. \nBut thats fine\n ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Her career in restaurant management drove me crazy (terrible long hours and not much $ for the hours she put in).  She came home at 1AM regularly and even though we lived together we barely spoke to each other due to my normal working hours (I'm a civil engineer). I was running on fumes averaging less than 5 hours of sleep a night while keeping our personal/home life together and make 90% of the $ to survive.  (mind you we had no kids or pets!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward: Yesterday, I saw her for the 1st time in 1.5 years. Her old job sent her W-2 to my place (which I bought for us) and me not being a jerk agreed to meet her to give it to her. I kept the conversion brief mostly a planned grey-rocking and I was slightly hungover from a buddy of mine getting married the night before so that actually helped me end the less than 10 minute conversation we had and walk away.\n\nObviously, the conversation was her telling me her life now.  She works 2 jobs, one with normal working hours now that pays her main bills (she says is kinda boring) and one on the weekend as a back waitress for a cooking/kitchen specialty restaurant (they teach cooking classes and serve made in front of you meals).  She was bragging, like she was the owner while giving me her 'fake'  hospitality smile she's learned so well over the years in the industry... \n\nShe proceeds to tells me her old job was horrible and the company took advantage of her, she got a dog, a new car, and her sister is always around now. ( Her sister turned into her new supply, which I knew was going to happen).  EVERYTHING i told her about her old company came true and she told me they were driving her crazy and I simply told her they drove ME crazy and I didn't even work for them.  Her sister uses people and it sounds like she is now using my NEx for her new apartment and life (She gave her sister a key so she can help 'take care of the dog' (lies.... her sister just wants a place to hang out as she can't afford her own place).  She got her sister a job at her \"weekend\" job so they now see each other and talk to each other daily.   She got a dog (I didn't get into it) because she doesn't like going out and it makes her happy.  The new car is a result of her going over her lease mileage allotted amount and contractual obligations (I told her this would happen).\n\nOverall, I went grey rock and acted like nothing new has happened in my life.  The only thing she said to me is she noticed my new car and she liked that it was a white color and now I'm skinny ( I lost 35 lbs and work out regularly as part of my healing process).  Nothing deep or how  I'm feeling, which I knew she wouldn't really care about.   I'm definitely in a better place knowing I handled seeing her and can tell she hasn't evolved at all in 1.5 years apart. She may be getting there very very slowly, but I know her and she is only telling me the \"positives\" in her life, she is numb emotionally and she doesn't even realize it. \n\nI can say I hope she realizes her sister is a user of people, but I don't think this will come naturally any time soon as she thinks her sister is the best person in her life.  I can't and won't involve myself with her family any more.  ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My dad is disabled and my mum works. I'm 21, go to university. I have great friends and love what I study. Even though I have mental health problems and a neurological disorder, I try my best.\nBut what has lingered in the back of my mind until the last few years is the psychological and verbal abuse from my dad. And I'm still in denial on the regular.\nSince I was a little kid,  I've had nightmares of him screaming at me. In the dark for some reason. He has never shyed away from calling me an idiot, fat, stupid, lazy. This is while yelling at me for things such as \n\n- him misinterpreting me as correcting him when I had only misheard him\n\n- turning the air conditioner off while he was out because I was cold\n\n- the toilet leaking because it wasn't bolted properly\n\n- eating a bag of chips and him walking by and saying 'my god, how much do you eat? ' when I was about 10\n\n- yelling at me for crying \n\n- disagreeing with him about same sex marriage (I'm in the closet for this reason)\n\n- talking while he watches TV\n\n-defending myself when he shit talks me in front of my brothers gf who is really nice \n\nBecause of this, I had anxiety attacks as a child. I was scared of being yelled at. I hid under tables. I didn't have a lot of friends. I only really made quality friends when I was about 17. Meanwhile,  my older brother was like the second coming of Jesus to the family.\n\nI've seen and heard of people who have great relationships with their dads. I nearly cried when I saw my friend hug her dad when he drove 4+ hours to pick her up. I was so touched today when my best friends dad gave me an Easter Bunny along with the rest of his family. It's like I don't really understand healthy masculinity. He's very particular about being a 'man'. He doesn't like people who thinks differently and Thinks because he sits and watches documentaries all day that he knows everything.\n\nHe's like this with my mum too. He talks down to her,  calls her an idiot,  yells and gets angry. She's numb,  she thinks it's normal. \n\nIt's getting to the point where I'm actually scared that he'll get angry enough to do something physically. I'm currently at a friends house for the night, I'm going home tomorrow and then the next night I'm staying with a friend on campus. I've been frantically looking for student accommodation but it's hard atm with semester starting soon. I'm hoping to talk to a social worker, in secrecy because if he found out I could risk losing my family. My mum is thankfully supportive of me moving and offered to help out a bit financially.\n\nI'm not really sure what I'm asking for, I still doubt myself and think it's my fault.

I think about vacations we went on, in particular a cruise where neither of us had access to phones and we spent all our time together just having fun and being carefree. We fought on the cruise, and he made me cry at one point, but a lot of times in our relationship when I felt like he was being his loving, kind self again felt absolutely amazing. I remember times waking up to him looking at me saying how much he loved me and times where we would eat out together and just enjoy each others company or stay up late talking for hours.

I've been out of the relationship for 2.5 months now, and sometimes still feel as confused as ever. My therapist has me on a strict no contact commitment, but I want to check in on him so bad. Apparently he's already out dating new people (even after he told me I was the one for him and he could never love someone else again how he loved me because I was the \"one\" and he felt like the luckiest guy alive to have me).

He's also facing charges for what he did to me ... so it's not like all the evidence isn't there to show me just how bad it was ... but at the same time I catch myself saying all the time \"well he just held you down by your throat. he didn't choke you that hard. and so what ... he punched you in the face? man up .... you're not dead\".

I then told him it\u2019s fine we could take 2 cars.

I\u2019ve been so hurt by the way he acts towards me, and how I have to beg him to show up for me.\n\n(The week before he lost a work client and took it out on me. I asked him to meet me halfway and turn the computer down a little\u2014 I was studying for a biology exam, and he told me everything he wanted didn\u2019t matter then verbally attacked me for 2 days straight because I hadn\u2019t cleaned the house.) He pays the rent, we\u2019re both on the lease. I started a new job last week and have paid $300 in groceries, plus saved $300 for rent. Back to the wedding..\n\nI was so hurt I told him \u201cfuck you, I\u2019m leaving for real this time\u201d but I never left and sat down trying to continue the argument/discussion. He then told me \u201cwhy am I here, I thought you were leaving\u201d and I said \u201cI was upset but I obviously don\u2019t want to leave\u201d. He then threw my notebooks off the desk into the wall and told me to \u201cget the fuck out\u201d and went to the closet and started to throw my things and clothes into the living room. Upset and crying I left and went to my car. I was in there almost 3 hours crying with a blanket while he was texting me nasty messages and calling nonstop. (I tried my best not to answer, because I feel like this only creates escalation).\n\nWhen I finally went back to the apartment he had me locked out and had weights and equipment baracaded afainst the door. My dog was inside and when he finally let me in I was crying and he took my apartment key, and placed my laptop and school supplies outside. He told me to leave and was so mean I left crying.\n\nSince then he has messaged me saying how I\u2019m insensitive to him needing to work to make money for the wedding stay, and that I spoke to him inappropriately to demean him, and I don\u2019t care about what he\u2019s going through.(he has stress from work and recently found out his brother is ill.)

So because of this, it is hard for me to go out with friends and she is constantly blowing up my phone, demanding to know where I am, what I\u2019m doing, who I\u2019m with, etc. I once tried to tell her that I am a legal adult, and that I thought that I should have some freedoms, such as staying out past 12. This angered her so much she cornered me, screamed (I don\u2019t mean scolded, I mean SCREAMED) at me about how the law doesn\u2019t apply to her, and tried to beat me. She has my money in a joint account with her, so she has access to my money and she can monitor what I spend. When she gets angry at me, she demands to either take my phone away, or for me to give it to her so that she can go through it. If I refuse, she will become violent until she has my phone. She is humiliated by the fact that I have ADHD, and constantly berates me for \u201cnot being normal\u201d and tells me that I need to learn how to act like regular people. She constantly talks about how she needs to keep me away from my father because he is the one who made me weird. I have been struggling with depression and self-harm since I was eight. When I told her that I felt that I needed to get professional help in the seventh grade, she got so violently angry at me and told me that if that\u2019s what I wanted to do then I should kill myself, since I\u2019m so selfish in the first place. She told me that I had no right to say that since I make her want to kill herself because of how hard I make her life. I was thirteen/fourteen. Ultimately, I feel like she only values me for my body. Constantly pressuring me to keep my virginity, by threatening me with the consequences of losing it before I get married. She hammered into my mind that I need to keep my depression, self-harm, ADHD, a secret and that I need to hold onto my virginity, and stay in college because no man would ever want me if he knew I had any flaws. \nI believe that her obsessiveness and clinginess ultimately stems from her goal to keep me as marriageable as possible, so that she can marry me to a wealthy man with a wealthy family. She wants the praise for raising such a beautiful and feminine daughter, the money from my future husband and I, and for me to bare a lot of grandchildren for her. When I reflect on her \u201cparenting\u201d from my childhood, it seems less like parenting, and more like raising and pampering cattle, or a show animal. I really am anxious to think about how she might have treated me had I been fat and had bad skin (ie had I been born \u201cugly\u201d), or mentally/physically disabled.\n\nFather - Only gets involved in my life when it's time to show off his strength and authority. He believes that ADHD is a \u201cdisease made up by millennial doctors so kids can get away with being lazy\u201d (Im paraphrasing but thats more or less what he said/believes) so when I was in elementary school, he would make me sit in front of him while doing homework. Whenever I zoned out, or made a silly mistake, he would swat me upside the head. He has pretty inexplicable mood swings. For example, one week he\u2019s be doting on me about how smart I am, how I\u2019m too good for boys, how proud of me he is, etc. The next week he\u2019ll be shouting at me about how I\u2019m so lazy that I\u2019ll never accomplish anything in life, I should just drop out of college because I don't try hard in anything. The most recent dramatic episode, was when he asked why I wasn\u2019t wearing gloves outside in the winter. I have explained this to him several times, but he doesn\u2019t remember. At this point, I had explained to him many, many, times why I did not have gloves. This was maybe the sixth time he asked that question. So finally, he went out, bought a large pair of mens gloves, and tried to give them to me. I did not ask him to buy me gloves. I had expressed countless of times that I did not like wearing gloves. And I couldn\u2019t even wear the gloves he bought me because they were way too big and wouldn\u2019t even stay on my hands. So he was very upset and hurt that I didn\u2019t wear the gloves, and pouted and ignored me for a day or so. I remember I once tried to communicate to my father about how his behavior made me feel and I was so emotional and upset that I was sobbing hysterically. He looked at me, laughed, and then turned back around in his chair, turned the volume on the television up so he couldn\u2019t hear me. When I was younger, I tried to fight back when he was hitting me, and I told them that he couldn\u2019t do whatever he wanted to me just because I was his kid. He told me that as his child, I am his property and if he wanted to hit me, he would (again, paraphrasing but more or less what he said). Recently, he and I got in a fight again and I asked \u201cyou think that just because you\u2019re my father you can say whatever horrible things you want to me and make me feel bad about myself?\u201d and he said \u201cyup! Absolutely.\u201d and then closed the door on me.\n\n\nNow that you get a general understanding of how my parents are, this is my situation. I need to get out as soon as possible. I am extremely depressed. I have not been able to sleep well at night because I cannot stop thinking about how I want to end my life. I am basically not allowed by my mother to go out with friends, leave the house without her permission, talk to men, be out past 8. If I try to break these rules, she will become violent. I have lied to her so that I could live a normal life, but if/when she finds out, she screams at me for literal hours about how I\u2019m ruining the family, I\u2019m a horrible monster, I\u2019m heartless, I\u2019ve ruined her life, etc., you get the point. My father can\u2019t be bothered to step in, and when he does, it\u2019s because he\u2019s annoyed by her yelling and can\u2019t hear the tv over her. I have decided that I am going to finish this semester of college, and then take a year or so off so that I can get myself in a better situation where I don\u2019t feel like I am in physical danger or so I don\u2019t feel like I am on the verge of ending it all. I know what kind of people my parents are, and I know that they will be very angered by this decision. They have control over most of my life and will make is as hard as possible for me to leave and take my rightful belongings with me. Also, no I do not have family. My father\u2019s family don\u2019t like him and have either completely cut him off, or keep very limited contact with him. I have no contact with my mother\u2019s family because they live on the other side of the Earth, speak little to no english, and she purposely kept us apart so that I could not expose her behavior to them. Is there any advice or help anyone can give me? Legal advice, help-lines, etc.? Anything and everything is appreciated. Thank you.\n", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I have been with my boyfriend, let's call him Jim, for a year now. My boyfriend's ex-wife, we'll call her Danielle, with which he shares two children with, has not been taking it well. Over the summer Danielle managed to find my mother on facebook. Danielle sent a facebook message to my mom back in July, telling her bad things about Jim and trying to turn her against Jim. My mom did not reply. My mom then received a three page letter in the mail from Danielle, containing false and exaggerated statements about Jim. My mom again did not respond. Danielle has since tried to contact my mom several more times through facebook (none of which she replied to) and is very adamant on trying to get my mom to take her side, which is not going to happen. Danielle then proceeded to friend and send a facebook message to my cousin, we'll call her Jasmin, asking Jasmin to ask my mom if she got any of her messages. Jasmin did not know who Danielle was at the time, so she accepted the friend request and replied, but now knows to ignore her. Last night, Danielle sent friend requests to both of my parents, and they responded by blocking her. Is there anything I can do to try and stop Danielle's behavior, or should we just continue to ignore it?

I'm craving him so bad. It's been 7.5 months NC and of course he left without any actual explanation. \"You're perfect, there's nothing wrong with you.\" Right, and that's why you cheated on me? Or were you just saying that to deepen the trauma bond, break my will and get me to come crawling back to you so that I no longer held back any part of myself from you? (Namely, my virginity.)\n\nI just want answers. I know there are none, except that he's a selfish, violent, unfaithful, insincere, deceitful, murderous, abusive rapist who doesn't give a shit about anyone but himself. And I know that he will *never* admit to any of those things. He didn't even admit to cheating; he just turned it around on me and acted like I was crazy for thinking we were still in a relationship. (Just a few days before he'd been sending me sweet texts. Of *course* I still thought we were in a relationship.) I KNOW that he's a piece of shit. But I still am fighting the urge to contact him. I fucking want closure. And he promised we'd meet sometime between four months ago and now, and then he blocked me without any explanation a couple months ago. There have been no hoovers, no contact whatsoever. It's driving me crazy.\n\nI don't know, maybe he figured I'd crack by now and come crawling back and offer him all of myself, but I didn't, and so he's punishing me. Or maybe he realized he's not going to crack me, and he gave up. I've been very good at NC, after all; and even right after the discard I wasn't half as dramatic as I'm sure he was hoping I'd be. So at least he didn't get that satisfaction out of me. I don't even know what bullshit he could have said to his friends; I responded to all the bullshit in a relatively temperate and calm manner. Because surprise surprise, he's the fucking 4 year old and I'm the adult.\n\nBut the truth is, I am just so very close to cracking.\n\nI fucking want to look him in the eyes and know that he lost the game I didn't know we were playing. I want him to know that I figured him out; that I distanced myself because I was subconsciously catching onto his game. (Hence his threatening to kill me when I asked if he was actually serious about me or not.)\n\nBut the problem is, if I tell him that I know who he is right now, he'll know that I'm still trauma bonded to him. He'll see it in my eyes. He'll know that he still has power over me. And I KNOW that if I go back to him, I WILL die. Either he'll kill me just like he said he would, or I'll feel so much shame and despair I'll kill myself in time.\n\nThe other thing is, I don't fully trust myself right now. There's still enough of me that's trauma bonded that I KNOW there's a little part of me that's trying to rationalize contacting him, because that tiny part of me is still secretly hoping I misunderstood everything and he's not a fucking sociopath, but I just missed out on the love of my life and I need to stop being so paranoid, like he told me I was.\n\nIt's just driving me crazy. It's like having a crazy poison oak rash all over my body, but my hands are tied down to my sides and I can't scratch the itch. I want to contact him so badly. I know this will pass; it's just driving me crazy. Someone please slap some sense into me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I continued dating her as it was her personal life and when she was going for abortion, I accompanied her to the clinic since no one else was going to. Then we spent more time together and she helped me when I was injured and needed her as well. Our relationship was obviously shifting away from casual to a more emotional state and we were both admitting to the feelings. Until we went for a short trip and there we fell in love. \"I love you\" slipped my tongue, and she said she wanted to tell me she did too, many times, but she held it back.\n\nWhat happened: \n\nWhen we came back from the trip, I asked if she's going to see someone while she's on a work trip for next 3 weeks. Although I knew she'd get uncomfortable about it I asked it anyways. We were both intoxicated. I said I just wanted to know because we were in an ambiguous stage and she was leaving, and that it's OK if she wants to see someone, I just don't like surprises and would like to know what her mindset was. She said she wasn't planning to see anyone. Then the day after when we met again, she said she wants to be with me, exclusively, and that she feels strongly for me, and after a few minutes of talking about feelings, etc. while she was looking quite emotional and deeply into my eyes, said \"There's a guy we video sex for a year now. We met twice before. If he's in the town I will sleep with him\".\n\nEven now that I'm talking about it, it messes my stomach up and makes my hands cold. It wouldn't hurt that much if she didn't say she loved me minutes before that. I asked her why and she said it was both physical and emotional. She said \"I want to feel what it is like to be with him again. I want to taste him one more time\". At this point I was almost puking. I asked what was so desirable in him that she couldn't find in me. She said \"Nothing. He never talks to me. I have his calendar to choose the time he is available to message him, he might or might not reply, but he usually does every 2-3 weeks. We do video sex and he disappears for another 3 weeks.\"\n\nI couldn't believe that a girl who is so independent in every aspect of her life, which was the quality that made me fall for her in the first place, can bend her character to such an extent for a guy who only notices her for her cam show. I was hurt, angry, disappointed, but more than that curious to know what was with her and him. After a long pause I listed a few things that I thought might be the issue. She was silent to all of them, except when I said is it the size of his penis? she said a part of it is about him having a bigger penis.\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nNow my size is average and I could definitely see that she was completely satisfied in bed. So I asked her if she genuinely is satisfied in bed with me, to which she said \"Very\". I think it's not just about sex, that guy is probably satisfying a complex she has, sex is the only outlet he allows her to get it. I need to see her relationship patterns to understand what made her tell me that she wants me for long and exclusive relationship but also told me that there was a guy she was yearning for, so much.\n\nThe hurt is still there. I haven't recovered after 4 days now? maybe 5. I wake up with a nasty anxiety like a red hot iron plate on my chest every day, feel like busting to tears in subway, the memories are killing me and can't focus on anything. Typical symptoms of a long-term emotional breakup. But what surprises me is, how can it happen so fast, and how can it hurt so bad in such a short time. I keep telling myself that I'm magnifying and exaggerating it, but it is not helping, the pain is there.\n\nOther's thoughts:\n\nIn the evening, my whole sorrow and shattered self esteem was replaced by anger when I talked to one of my friends about it and she unapologetically pointed out that the girl is actually abusing and blackmailing me. That she has first pampered my emotions and once she has made sure that my guard is down and I will absorb whatever she throws at me, she had chosen a common insecurity in men to attack me. I started mumbling that yeah the counselor also asked if this can be her way of saying \"If you don't get into an exclusive relationship with me I will sleep with someone else\" but maybe she was just trying to be honest blah blah... at that point my friend said \"Well then let's talk about something else because it drives me mad to see people who get abused, defend their abuser. I can't take it. If she just wanted to be honest about her yearning for someone else, she would just tell you that and wouldn't say she wants you. What she's doing is firstly pulling you closer to herself, and then saying there is someone that I want because he is better than you\". Seeing her anger at me taking an abuse, combined with the fact that I remembered how my partner was satisfied with me, things started making sense.\n\nWhat I've done about it:\n\nThat night I asked her if she wanted to hurt me, to which she replied \"Yes\". \"When you told me that you reply texts from your ex, I got jealous. I also wanted to tell you about that guy earlier. So it's all true. But yes I wanted to hurt you with it. If we are exclusive though, I'd never even reply him, I want to be with you\", etc. She was referring to our conversation where I told her that in certain situations, I reply to my ex, such as her father's death, she wishing me on my birthday, etc. and that I didn't want to cut everything with her immediately because it was cruel to leave someone like that after 2 years of relationship.\n\nWhat I want:\n\nApart from all the heartbreak, now I don't know, if it is healthy to stay in relationship with a girl who once carefully planned how to hurt me. It raises questions about my own psychology; am I OK with being abused? Is there a deep seeded complex or complication in me if I accept her despite what happened? It's true that I feel like I can't trust her anymore. But I also know that time can change how I feel and I might be able to trust her in future, considering that I still like other aspects of her. As for her, she didn't seem too apologetic about what she did, but she was crying when she saw me in pain the next day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR, Fell in love with someone who claims she loves me too, but she also told me that there was a guy that she'd sleep with if he was available. Later she claimed that she wanted to hurt me while being honest, for trivial jealousy over me replying ordinary texts from my ex, and that she wouldn't sleep with that guy if we were exclusively in a relationship. Now I don't know if I can trust her anymore to stay in a relationship with her.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

In my third year of my education i got a new teacher, lets call her ET (evil teacher). At the start of the year everybody in my class had to pick a healthcare organisation to do an internship and research project for. I was really happy with my choice, but then my organisation dropped out. I was placed (without consent) into another organisation (one i did not like at all) together with 2 classmates ( both girls). The 2 girls  did not like each other from the start. They got in a fight constantly and it got so bad that they would ask me to deliver a message to the other. This was a problem since we had to do the research paper within 6 months. After around 4 weeks our group had our weekly meeting with ET for feedback. ET did not let anyone finish speaking and interrupted constantly. I got pretty fed up with this so i told ET ( in a polite and civil manner) that interrupting people was not helpful or nice. This was the point she started hating me. I could not do a single thing right. 5 months into the project the 2 girls in my group quit, one left school, the other wanted to start over after Christmas. I could not finish the project on time so i was forced to start over. This time i could choose a organisation that i did like. Unfortunately i had to do the whole project on my own, and i still had ET as my mentor. Luckily i had a good time as in intern, the organisation i worked for was happy with me and gave me all the help i needed. I managed to finish my research project on time aswell as doing my internship tasks. These whole 6 months ET refused to give me any proper feedback. She told me i better quit with my education, i was not smart enough, i did not posses the required people skills. It started eating away at my confidence, to the point i developed an severe anxiety disorder. I told my parents about this teacher, but they thought i overreacted ( im stubborn, but most teachers really liked me). I talked with my school counselor about it, but she was not really helpful. At the end of the 6 months ET, me and my organisation got together to give me my final grade. I already knew my organisation was happy with me, i worked on the feedback they gave me and they told me i passed the internship. I was custom that the organisation graded the student, and the teachers usually went along with this grade. I got an 8/10, witch is pretty good. However, ET did not agree. Without even reading my research paper she claimed i FAILED. I better quit school.\n\nI was devastated, i did work meant for 3 students all by myself in 6 months. My mom did not understand it either, so i arranged a meeting with ET, myself and my mom. To my surprise the school counselor was at the meeting as well. ET had talked to her ( and the counselor had broken her confidentially agreement). ET did not say a thing for the first 15 minutes (did not shake mine or my moms hand), let the counselor name all the things i was bad at and why i should stop school. After 15 minutes the first thing ET says is that i lacked people skills. My mom got furious (my mom is a  psychologist and a really sweet/calm person, always sees the best in people). Later on my mom told me she thought there was something wrong ( psychological ) with ET. My mom apologized for not believing me, she was shocked that someone as ET could teach.\n\nAfter the summer i switched courses, did not have ET as my teacher and i managed to do my internship and research project without any problems.\n\nI still hate ET, i still have anxiety and i still lack confidence. ET broke my spirit by telling me that i was stupid, not worthy... etc... At one point i even started believing her. During that year i felt so alone..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long story/rant.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I had a post a few days or so ago where I just kinda broke a little bit. Thank you all for being here for letting me vent stuff out. I\u2019ve thought about this even more and I\u2019ve decided to work towards a divorce.\n\nThis is something I have contemplated a great deal on beforehand. I have a son and stepdaughter, and a house so it\u2019s definitely not a light decision. My decision came from two things:\n\n1. I need to do the best for my son and not have him in a toxic household. She may be the narc, but it causes toxicity for everyone, including me.\n\n2. I want to be happy again and I haven\u2019t been for over a year.\n\nTherapy won\u2019t help this (marriage counseling anyway). I plan on seeing a therapist on my own again when I can. I don\u2019t want to put more energy into this dead situation so I want it to end for the health of my son. I also don\u2019t want my job affected since I finally have a good paying one that values me. I also want my relationship with my family and friends back and I just can\u2019t do it in this situation. I\u2019m alone and miserable and I hate it.\n\nI know I didn\u2019t mention my stepdaughter in the number one spot, and that\u2019s not that I don\u2019t love her. I really do. But I\u2019m limited with what I can do there. My wife\u2019s parents told me in confidence while I was telling them about a lot that has happened that they would fight for custody of her if need be. I support them 100000%. I would always make sure that the two butt heads grow up around each other. They\u2019re siblings they need to.\n\nI talked to my mom about this and she said she knew I would get to this point but that she felt I had to come to the decision myself. My brother in law (wife\u2019s brother) also knows as he lives with us and he supports it 100% as well. Something tells me I\u2019m not just crazy if even her own brother agrees with me on the things that have been going on.\n\nHell even warning the daycare of what will happen eventually, they said they could tell for months I had just been down and not happy. They aren\u2019t shocked by any part of the situation either. \n\nI just plan on somehow getting my finances together, securing a lawyer, and then moving into breaking the news. As much as I\u2019m looking forward to it, I\u2019m not. It\u2019s not gonna be fun but it is necessary.\n\nThis is only my second post and I\u2019ve mostly just read stuff here, but thank you all for the encouragement to do this even if you didn\u2019t know you were encouraging me. I hope there\u2019s more like me that get the strength to know they deserve better for themselves and/or they\u2019re family too. Maybe I\u2019ll even be able to do that with this post.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We have lived together for 4 years. Hes 44 im 41 and we live in florida. He makes more money than I do. There was a period of time a year-and-a-half that I was ill and did not work and he took care of us.  If I am working though I have always contributed to the bills. Currently we split all of the bills evenly. If I have been short he has taken up the slack. I've only been short when I've had emergency surgeries and recovered but even then my part of the rent was paid. He has never been overly generous with money. We went five years without a living room set not even a couch. I could not really afford it and he refused to purchase it altho he had thousands in the bank and kept a cpl thousand at home.  In the past since he has taken up slack for me before if I got a large sum of money such as taxes or the like I have put forth that money to Bills. When we moved into the house we are currently living I paid the entire first month's rent and deposit to get us in. Soon I will be getting Social Security and He suggests I use the entire check from that to pay our rent. There is an additional $75 that SSI won't cover and He suggests we split that $75. I think since I am paying almost the entire rent he should pay the 75.  He says since i dont work for that money it should go to rent.  Also I will be getting a few thousand dollars from taxes in a few days. The last couple of weeks he has made statements like I'm going to wait to buy such and such until you get your money. He has said this about a few items at this point totaling about $400. I feel disrespected that instead of asking me to buy him any of those things he's basically telling me I'm going to. Also I feel like he can buy those things on his own as he is now saving $350 a month in rent. I actually have plans to purchase some stuff FOR HIM that I Want to do but his attitude is making me want to not get anything.   I feel as though he is being greedy an acting entitled.  If i only had to pay 75 a month in rent id be ever so grateful to whomever made that possible and i wouldnt be waiting with baited breath acting entitled to their tax money.  Keep in mind our accts have always been seperate. He will not let me look at his acct.  So he does not see mine either.  When he has had large sums i never asked nor told him to get me anything.  Never have.  \n\nSo whos being greedy?  Me or him?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I may be being overly precocious but I want to make sure that this time is the last time he has any way of getting in contact with me. He hasn't contacted them in the past but I figure the less chance he has to do so, the more chance I have towards my final recovery. \n\nI am also afraid of him visiting my town this weekend. When he comes here, he visits his dad who lives across from me. I do not think he will come to my house, but I will be cautious as to leave the house just in case I bump into him. \n\nThe thing is, it shouldn't have to be this way. I shouldn't have to be wary and afraid of him. It's not because I think in any way he will physically harm me, its how he will emotionally get to me if he ever gets the chance to. I am afraid of being in that vulnerable position, again. \n\nOn the flip side, I am also having anxiety because I am nervous of losing his contact. Which sounds bizarre. After the way he has treated me over a span of 12 years, you would think I would know that contacting him would result in the same pattern of behavior from him. It was only yesterday that I decided to block him because he showed some of his demanding colours when I caught him in a lie. Saying how if he was to behave a certain way, then I must not get angry at the things that he does.

This made the situation my fault, I guess.\nHe noticed me right away and we started \u201cdating.\u201d  My parents were thrilled and did everything they could to enable the relationship.  They bought me a car, taught me to drive on the interstate so I could go to his apartment, etc.  By \u201cdating\u201d I mean I was waiting for him after the game and going to his apartment.  Each night we would go to his room.  We were engaging in sex acts just short of vaginal intercourse.  I felt obligated to please him, though I enjoyed it, too.  I had had similar experiences with my previous boyfriend, who was my own age, so I wasn\u2019t entirely innocent.  My parents didn\u2019t know that.  They were just thrilled that we were dating.  I was in love.  He said he loved me too.\nThe summer flew by and fall came.  My mom and I brought him to the airport when he went home for the off-season.  With promises to call and write, he left.  I got one letter and my dad was able to reach him once by phone.  Then nothing.  My family planned a trip to Florida during Spring Training.  I saw him there and he practically ignored me.  He told me where he was staying, though, so after we got home I called him.  (I am a very anxious person and talking to him in person and calling him were very hard things to do.  I would\u2019ve just let it go but my parents insisted.)  In that phone call he barely talked to me.  I learned later that he\u2019d gotten married over the winter and his wife was pregnant.  \nOk, that was it for me.  But my meddling mother wanted to hear the story from him.  A friend of ours was friends with him, too, and told us where he was staying.  My mom went over to his new apartment and had a talk with him.  He told her he was sorry, he loved me, blah, blah, blah.  A couple days later my mom had arranged for me to go over there (I mean she MADE me go over there).  I sat at his dining room table ostensibly for him to help me with my Spanish class.   He took my hand to look at my class ring and didn\u2019t let go.  Next thing you know, we were making out on the couch.\nBy then, I had just turned seventeen.  And now we were having intercourse.  My parents believed he was going to leave his wife and new baby.  I guess I did too.  I would still wait for him by the door after the games.  That is, until we were humiliated at a game one night.  So, I started waiting in the car.  Again, I would\u2019ve just stopped seeing him if not for my mother.  Still every night we went back to his apartment and had sex (except when he was on the road).  This time I told my mom we were having sex and she just said \u201cbe careful.\u201d  We were and thankfully I never got pregnant.\nAt the end of that season he left.  I heard from him once a few years later.  He wrote me a letter in which he said he missed me.  Then, about 25 years after that, I tracked down his sister in his hometown thanks to the internet and sent a relatively innocuous letter to her and received a letter back from him.  He included his phone number and, somehow, I gathered the courage to call.  We started talking and I started sending him letters professing my undying love.  Until one day, I got a phone call from his wife.  I hung up on her.  A few days later she sent a letter.  I called him and he told me we needed to cool it and he\u2019d be in touch.  That was about ten years ago and, since then, nothing.\nIn the 25 years that I hadn\u2019t heard from him, I got married and had three sons.  My marriage is not that great, but that's another story.  My relationship with my parents is estranged.  I see them maybe once a year.  They always bring up this man.  My mom says, \u201coh you know you had FUN.\u201d  They hate my husband.\nAnd still I think of the man every day and miss what we had.  \n", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Everything I kept were gifts of pitty love &amp; left overs from the love bombing stage. It hurt so much to cut up all the cards he gave me...but I knew it was all just things I was holding onto that meant a lot to me at the time but LITTLE to him. They were just ways of keeping me attached. I felt so relieved afterwards. I left a message with each item just letting go of all the painful memories that were associated with them &amp; threw them away.

I know how hard it is to break out of and I think that\u2019s one reason I don\u2019t really know how to help her.\n\nSome background: they\u2019ve been together since high school and have two children. He has never been good to her. He\u2019s cheated multiple times, emotionally abused her throughout their relationship (controls the finances, cuts her off from loved ones, makes her feel like she doesn\u2019t need help, etc), and has been physically abusive on numerous occasions. He actually has a domestic violence conviction on his record already.\n\nA few nights ago at a party, he got very drunk. When she tried to get him to slow down, he slammed her against a wall and choked her. It took three people to get him off of her. Shortly after, she caught him with another woman and he became violent again, pushing her off the porch. Their children (3 and 8) both saw the whole thing.\n\nShe told me that this time she wants to leave. This was it for her. But she\u2019s not sure she can do it.

I take her word for it because she has no motivation to lie about it and it's freaking me out a lot. I have lots of memories of being abused as a child and my parents tried to gaslight me my whole life. I have a horrible memory from my substance use issues. I know for a fact that my mom did things like scream about how she wished she never had me and scream that she'd kill herself if I left the house to get coffee instead of staying so she could hurl insult after brutal insult at me. I feel like if I wasn't in therapy at the time of this I'd probably already doubt that that even happened. My mom swears it never happened. The further back I go the less I trust my memory. I have a lot of memories of my childhood but I pretty much have a hard time believing anything from my childhood even happened at all, or even most of my teen years for that matter. I occasionally get this paranoia that reality is so far apart from what I think that I'd never be able to tell. What if people I used to know never existed and I just spent that time babbling to myself like a lunatic? It's not a thought I take too seriously or have often but it just shows how extreme my paranoia and distrust of my own sense can go. I also had an abusive ex boyfriend but I spend all this time agonizing of which details really happened and it was about a year ago when I dumped him, he even apologized for crossing my boundaries sexually over and over because he thought I'd grow to like the things I explicitly said never to do.  I remember his fake tears when I'd call him out on it and the multiple conversations we had about stop doing things to me in bed I told you no to before we even went on one date. I know that happened but then I spend hours agonizing over things like him suggesting we do something and then for seemingly not reason saying it was my idea hours later. I know it wasn't my idea I knew nothing about it but I still wonder if  it was. Why? Why do I trust this person who I know is a liar and an abuser over my own sense? I feel sick to my stomach of the silliest conversation right now. She probably has no idea I'm freaking out about that little misunderstanding hours later and honestly I don't want to tell her because I want honesty so I can my basic abilities of understanding reality and if I tell her she might be afraid to correct me if I say something and she said it didn't happen like that at all. I'm not really sure if I should make as big a deal of this as I am, she said she easily could have just misremembered herself but I'm a burnout and she's not so I'm going to believe her over myself because it happened a few months ago and I can't really say I'm sure what happened even though I thought I was before", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He is 33, and I am 21. When we met I was 20, and he was 32. I\u2019ve never had a relationship before so I definitely made a lot of mistakes. For the first few weeks he was absolutely perfect. Charming, supportive, a true genius. I was completely over the heels about him, and couldn\u2019t believe this is happening to me. He was telling me how smart I am (best compliment for me lol) and how awesome I am. \n\nBut there was one problem. I am an escort. During that time I also had to pay off a lot of money to my \u201cpimp\u201d so he would leave me alone (I did all the work myself after 3 months of \u201cworking\u201d with him). I am very safe at work and make my boundaries very clear, but with him I let myself slip twice. First time was on our first date, and I was drunk. Second time was when he visited me at a new place I\u2019ve moved to. Since I had no idea he was seeing other girls (I just foolishly assumed he didn\u2019t because of how much time we spent together), I was afraid of him ditching me for someone \u201ccapable\u201d of doing what he wants, and he said a few times that unprotected sex feels incomparably better. But I made a mistake here. (We both got tested several times since and thankfully are clean.)\n\nHe didn\u2019t know about my work then. I was really scared to tell him (and that was selfish of me). For one, it\u2019s illegal, two, I was trying to see how open minded he is, and three, I wanted to tell him before it as it gets serious, but I had no clue when that is.\n\nSo it was 6 weeks in, and I finally told him. It wasn\u2019t so bad. He said that I am very smart to do this, and he supports me.\nThe following week he was really curious and asked me a lot of questions. Next week I found out he sees other girls. \u201cBaby girl, we never had a discussion about exclusivity\u201d. And that \u201cwe just spend time together\u201d. Yeah, my fault, I was going off my assumptions. I was really upset but I got over it. \n\nSummary of what happened next:\n\n* Two weeks after me telling him about my work he said he doesn\u2019t want to have sex with me anymore. Ever. He said that we can spend time like before because he wasn\u2019t with me \u201cto get in my pants\u201d. \n\n* He got distanced from me for about 1.5 months because of something that happened in his life. I was really supportive of him, and told him he can tell me about it whenever he feels ready. We didn\u2019t hang out then, but we exchanged calls.\n\n* My birthday was at the end of that period, and we went to a restaurant and it mad absolutely majestic. I felt really happy. \n\n* We had sex a few weeks after my birthday. I didn\u2019t initiate it. I called him asking what was that about: should I forget about it as an accident, or can I be hopeful for something later on? He said there could be something in the future, but he doesn\u2019t have answers for me. And that he doesn\u2019t have regrets.\n- In December I started feeling really alone. He was always busy, work was a bit slow because of Christmas, and I started having suicidal ideations (passive). I got obsessed with the idea of getting a cat because I couldn\u2019t depend on that person for making me less alone. \n- He invited me for a New Years Eve concert. I said I planned to spend it with my family, but he got a bit upset: are you choosing your mom over me? (I don\u2019t have the best relationship with her because she didn\u2019t believe me for a long time that I was molested by her ex - I still love her though and we are working on things). So I cancelled plans with mom and went with him (my choice! I don\u2019t care about concerts but I wanted to spend time with him). \n\n* I finally got a kitten that day, and that person left me early in the morning because the kitten had an accident on the bed. I was really sad and didn\u2019t want him to leave (I was on the verge of crying for some reason), but he left anyway.\n\n* The whole thing with a cat was a mess. I put a responsibility on an unknowing animal to support me, but it was just a kitten. I was crying a lot when it was meowing a lot and misbehaving. \n\n* In general I was crying a lot. My suicidal thoughts went over the roof. I thought that nobody will ever love me while I do this job and so on. That I am not worthy of love. One night I was rereading old texts we exchanged with that person, and spent the evening spacing out in front of screen and crying. I thought I will never be as happy as I was then. That night I wrote out my suicide plan and even bookmarked a store in google maps where I would get the \u201cequipment\u201d. Thankfully next day I felt super numb and tired and didn\u2019t go anywhere. I called suicide hotline and they convinced me to tell my therapist about it. \n\n**THE WEIRD STUFF**\n\nI still felt suicidal and so on. I finally met with that person and told him about my feelings. He said he would miss me if I died. This is where he started talking about some very strange things: \n\n* He mentioned that before, but this time he was really trying to grill this idea into my head: \u201c4 corners of life\u201d that he heard from some comedian: FAMILY, FRIENDS, HOBBIES, and WORK. If you don\u2019t have those together, relationship will not work out. Relationship is a multiplier: if you have all of that, it will make you happier, if you don\u2019t- it will make it worse. I had to repeat it to him to show I\u2019ve memorized it. The irony of that was that he didn\u2019t consider my work to count as WORK.\n* I told him about the client I had who was seeing escorts because his gf doesn\u2019t give him blowjobs, and now that they might get engaged he wants to quit seeing escorts. I was giving him advice on how to gently introduce her to blowjobs, while also respecting her. That person said their relationship is not going to work out because \u201cif a woman doesn\u2019t submit to a man, relationship is doomed to fail. 50/50 thing doesn\u2019t work\u201d.\n* I told him I felt that nobody will ever commit to me while I do this job. He stayed silent. Then I said that if I work for a year as much as I can, I can quit and then fall in love and so on. He said it\u2019s a bad idea and I shouldn\u2019t do that. \n* Then he said that there are many men who are \u201cready to settle\u201d, and that now as \u201cwomen fuck through their 20s they can\u2019t bond with their serious partners\u201d (I know this is bullocks). I reminded him of what I do for work, and he said that I am different, because I dissociate at work.\n* He said he is not that kind of person who would be with an escort, because men are possessive.\n* Not in that conversation, but a while back he said that I remind him of himself when he was my age, and he is trying to give me wisdom that he wish he had before. And also once he said that he is like a father figure for me (which made me cringe because we had sex before). \n\nThen we went to play Scrabble. He won. It will be important later. \n\n* Also that night he said that the reason he got upset and distant before my birthday was because he broke up with a girl and that she was diagnosed with BPD two weeks before their breakup. Later on he would constantly \"trash\" her in front of me, saying that I am miles ahead of her in terms of maturity, and that some psychiatrist he went to do evaluation to said that \"BPD is a personality trait\". I defended her.\n\nI was upset at some things he said, but I also felt better because I realized I wasn\u2019t alone. I talked to and met with my friends, and started recovering. We sort of morphed into \u201cfriends\u201d at this point. \n\nWe celebrated his birthday together. It was great, I gifted him a great gift (he is definitely a gift person) and wrote in my gift card . He was super happy about it. One weird thing he said there:\n\n* (paraphrasing) \"Some people just can't do things on their own. They need someone to manage them. I trained my mom to whine less and she is better now, you should do the same to your mom. I need to do that to my friend who is always negative.\"\n\n* I said that people are not dogs.\n\n\nI made an account on Tinder to find hookups. Since I wanted to follow the \u201c4 corners\u201d thing, I planned to just hookup for a bit, nothing serious. I told him about it. He didn\u2019t say much. A few days later he invited me to eat sandwiches in the park during his lunch break, and I was excited to hang out! As we sat there he immediately started telling me how me being on Tinder is a bad idea, and I will waste my life this way. I was a bit pissed: \u201cWhat am I supposed to do, be alone while I stay in this work for years?!\u201d He said he doesn\u2019t care about sex at this point. I said \u201cthat\u2019s great, but I am not there yet\u201d. I started calling him out on things he did before, like giving me false hope for sex and so on. He said he regretted it. \n\nHe started telling me again how I should have told him earlier about my work, it was my fault we had unprotected sex, and that despite that he was \u201cSO NICE TO ME\u201d, and what did I want him to do, ditch me on the spot? Also he said if I was really scared it means I knew what I did was wrong. Well, I was there to have fun, but I felt really attacked. \n\nSo I left crying and then was greeted by my meowing cat who was driving me insane. I was crying and had a migraine. I had work in the evening. My migraine was killing me by the end of it, so when I came home and cat was yelling at me, I texted that person my vent, cried a bit from pain and telling cat to shut up, and fell asleep. But right before that I texted cat\u2019s foster mom that I have to return him. So when I heard phone buzzing I thought it was her, so I just ignored it and fell asleep. \n\nI woke up to loud knocks at my door. I open the door and there are THREE COPS standing there. Basically that person told them I am suicidal. So I explained to them that I am fine and just had a migraine, we laughed about it and they went on their way. I was shook, I checked my phone, and he texted me before and called me 3 times. Everything happened in duration of 1.5 hours. I was grateful he cared but I also wonder what would\u2019ve happened if I had work then. I can\u2019t text back at work. So I texted him that I just had a migraine and passed out. He said \u201cyou freaked me out\u201d. \n\nI felt really horrible for making him worry and wrote a long apology to him. That week he was supposed to have some medical procedure in Canada, so I wanted for his reply. He does have a habit of replying several days later or not replying at all. He finally got replied and said that I am awesome and he still cares about me. I texted one of my friends about it and she said that I should \u201crun, not walk away from this guy\u201d and that he made me suicidal. I defended him then. \n\n\n**REALLY WEIRD STUFF**\n\nThe whole thing about his medical procedure was driving me insane by the way. First he told me it was a brain surgery, then he said it was a joke, then when he texted me back he said he woke up from brain surgery (\u201cI had brain surgery, remember?\u201d). And I was like \u201cSo brain surgery was for real?\u201d And he said maybe. Then when I text him when he comes back he tells me that he is recovering from \u201c12 hour surgery\u201d. He also had a bit of hair shaved off. The latter I saw with my own eyes. But when he called me he said that if there was a 12 hour surgery he wouldn\u2019t be so casual about it. So my mind is really confused at this point. I am usually ok with people not telling me things, but I am going insane at this point. I ask him \u201ccan you at least tell me why you don\u2019t tell me?\u201d And he said no. \n\nAlso whenever we called each other and I mentioned in passing that my escort friends never told their boyfriends about their jobs, he would call me out and tell me I told him too late and he was NICE TO ME.\n\nWhen we met last time I asked him why he makes this stuff up and he said \u201cbecause it is more fun this way\u201d. And when I asked him \u201cwhy\u201d again he said that I should accept that I will never find out, and I am not being accepting by asking him questions. I just want to know what is real at this point. He also said our relationship was a rebound for him, and it was not healthy for him.\n\nThis day we planned to play scrabble together. He also briefly messed with me by saying that we will be doing interview questions for his work instead, and I was really confused and said \u201cno, we are paying scrabble\u201d. We had that several times until he sat down and we talked about other things. There is pizza place right across mine where there is scrabble. He grabbed his backpack when we left my place and I asked: \u201cAre you leaving after this from here?\u201d And he said \u201cNo, just a reflex\u201d. He also said that he won\u2019t pay for my stuff anymore because we are not dating (I usually don\u2019t mind splitting bills, but every time we met before he insisted on paying, except my birthday where he insisted on at least splitting the bill). This time - shock for everyone - I won! He pretty much immediately said that he is going to leave. So he lied about \u201cnot leaving\u201d and reflex thing. \n\nIn the evening he texts me: \u201cSorry about you losing the game\u201d.\nI space out for a second. \u201cNo, I won\u201d. \nSo he had this whole exchange with me insisting that he won and I can\u2019t prove it, and when I said \u201cI am not playing scrabble with jerks\u201d, he said he is just teasing me.\n\n**THE FALLOUT**\n\nNext day was supposed to be great. I finally paid off my \u201cpimp\u201d! I was free. I didn\u2019t tell that person about existence of the \u201cpimp\u201d because I felt really dumb for getting myself into this and wanted to tell him when I am free. So I said something really great happened and I would love him to congratulate me. After asking me what happened and me saying that I am not talking about it over text, he said \u201cno, I am not playing your games\u201d and later he managed to completely ruin my excitement. I was really upset that he was so mean to me. Everyone else was congratulating me! \n\nNext morning he texted to apologize, and I called him in the afternoon to tell him about it. I expected him to congratulate me...\n\nInstead it went like this:\n\n\u201cSo the story is long as I warned you...\u201d[me telling him it from the beginning]\nAfter a few mins he interrupts me and says:\n\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d\nI try to condense it and get to the point. That I had a pimp and now I paid him off and am free.\n\u201cWell congrats, but you lied to me\u201d.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou said you were independent, but he was doing all work for you. You said you had the account but you lied!\u201d\nSo I said if he listened he would have understood that I did all the work by myself anyway. And that I was ashamed to tell him. He goes on.\n\u201cBeing ashamed is not an excuse, you give me information piece by piece and it upset me and is deeply concerning.\u201d \nI totally did not expect that so I yelled at him saying fuck you and hung up. \n\nI was crying so much. I told my friends about it and every single person was supportive of me. It was none of his business that I had a pimp, it didn\u2019t concern him in any way whatsoever. His reaction was very strange especially considering we are not in a relationship. \n\nThe friend who told me to \u201crun\u201d from this guy told me a lot of hard truths. That he doesn\u2019t like me, that I ruined his fantasy of me. At first he met me I was this cute 20 year old - jackpot! Then I revealed I am an escort, and he felt disgusted at himself and at me for ruining his fantasy of me. And telling him about pimp was the same thing, round 2. \n\nI sent him a long explanation of my situation, that he made it about himself when it was not, and called him egocentric. \n\nI met one of my regulars the following evening and vaguely shared that with him. He said that person was obsessive and self-absorbed. And that if he cared he would have responded by then. \n\nI told another friend about the whole thing and she said he was gaslighting me. That\u2019s how we came here. \n\nI drafted my farewell message to him (saying we are done and wishing him luck and so on, pretty neutral), deleted our conversations and renamed him in contacts. If he replies to my explanation, I will send it. \n\nSo I started reading about gaslighting. As I read on, I got really angry and disgusted. It seems like this is what it was, but what if I am wrong? Did I misunderstand? \n\nAlso had a mushroom trip on this weekend, and I had thoughts like \u201cbeing with him was disgusting\u201d, \u201cthat friendship should go to the trash\u201d, and that \u201cI cut out a bad person out of my life\u201d.

I slammed a couple doors on my way out. I can't say this is the first time I've snapped at him, but it's definitely the first time I got so angry with so little provocation.

I feel like I can't hang on anymore. He is a total narcissist, nothing is his fault, everything is my fault. He has caused me so much fucking trouble. He just keeps yelling at me over and over and over. I can't say a fucking opinion, I can't say a fact even if it is supported by fact if it is about something him and I don't agree with (which is most things). I can't talk about anything I like, do, am interested or anything about myself because he just mocks me about over and over. I've cut myself so many times after arguments with him, or him just being a narcissist dick. He emotionally abuses everyone who lives in the house, and from what I can tell I have the worst but I don't know really, I purposefully isolate myself from my family most of the time. It feels like he doesn't love me, it just seems so conditional. Parents are suppose to love you unconditionally, but not my dad, not my fuck dad. It's scary how quickly he changes, one minute we'll be having family time and he won't be doing shit, but then he just says so much shit. My mom isn't even better. She's a fucking psychologist, let's just get that out of the way. She fucking enables the abuse even though she literally watches it happen. I can't come out to my family either (genderfluid and omnisexual) because they would emotionally abuse me more and possibly kick me out or physically abuse me. If my house could become more of a hell coming out would do it. It's always my fault, and if it's not I deserve it. My dad also knows that I am depressed as hell and am taking Zoloft and Prozac. A couple days ago when I was taking my anti-depressants he just goes up to me and says \"sometimes it better to pretend to be happy\" and then left for work. No shit, I didn't try doing that for a year and half before being forced into therapy. What the fuck why would he think to say that to a depressed person, oh wait it's because he doesn't believe in mental health. The husband of a nationally renowned psychologist doesn't believe in mental health. One of the biggest reasons I haven't kill myself yet is that I am worried about failing and he called a suicide survivor who now goes around doing suicide awareness a \"loser\". His exact quote was \"is no one going to point out what a loser this guy is? He failed at jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge.\" I want to run away, I want to kill myself. I don't even know where I would go if I ran away, no one else in my family would be good and none of my friends would be able to probably take me in. I fucking hate my dad. I don't know what to do. I'm 14 so I still have awhile before I can move out, support myself etc. I'm so lost. ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

He was my first love so I didn\u2019t want to let go. We had spontaneously made plans for me to go over one day. He lives an hour away and as I was driving over he invited another girl over at the same time. I was there for 15 minutes before I had to leave because the other girl came. I left to roam the mall by myself for an 1.5 hours alone because he told me not to make any plans. I went back because I figured the girl was gone because it was just for sex but she was still there. I told him to come down and I yelled at him and started shoving him in his driveway saying this wasn\u2019t fair to me. We got in a big fight. He offer to kick her out and I\u2019d say no then he\u2019d tell me to leave and I\u2019d say no. He eventually kicked her out and I just yelled at him more in his room. As I drove back home I called him yelling and crying. I was sobbing my eyes out. He said he didn\u2019t ever want to be with me Again and that he didn\u2019t love me. And after that I felt terrible for what I did and I got scared of myself because I have never gotten like that before. I went to a therapist and got diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and i would call him constantly crying and begging for him not to see me this way because it isn\u2019t me and I\u2019m losing myself. And he\u2019d just be distant. I wrote him a journal talking about everything and asking him not to give up on us. He read it after a week I gave it to him and he came back. He was like I love you! Don\u2019t go back to school single! I love you and want to be with you. I was scared to accept him back fully but he convinced me it was a lasting feeling. He called me one morning and just told me he couldn\u2019t get it up with a girl. It was confusing. I told him I didn\u2019t like him talking to girls and he said \u201cI want someone better. I never said I wanted to be with you. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u201d. And he did that like 3-4 times. Saying he loved me and then saying he didn\u2019t. It was so exhausting. Im exhausted even remembering and typing it. He lied to me about using protection with the first girl he slept with. I had sex with him like 4-5 days after he slept with the first girl after our breakup and I asked him did you use a condom? And he said yes so we didn\u2019t use a condom when we had sex. A month later he nonchalant tells me that he lied about using a condom because he didn\u2019t want to use one with me. I calmly told him that wasn\u2019t okay and that he put me at risk and that I didn\u2019t consent to that. I explained to him that there was no possible way of him knowing if he was clean or not after 4 days because symptoms take a month to appear. And he yelled at me to SHUT THE FUCK UP. I KNOW WHAT I DID. JUST SHUT UP. And then he said I\u2019m sorry. And I hugged him and told him it was okay. (Because Im a dumbass). And he was swearing up and down that he loved me and wanted to be with me and was talking about our future and wanting to move in together and get married. And the next day he went on a date and I freaked out and spam called him for 2 hours and he blocked me. And then he told me he didn\u2019t love me and still wanted other girls. Then four days later he fucked his ex that he said he didn\u2019t care about or love. But she told me he flirted with her all the time and never talked about me. And said I cheated on him. And I am by no means free of blame! I was psychotic. I yelled and shoved him and hit his chest on three occasions. I wouldn\u2019t let him leave one day. And recently we had sex after a month of not seeing each other but right after we had sex he was kicking me out his house at 2 am and I had nowhere to sleep and he got mad that I had to sleep over and he just got so mad at me. I was trying to calm him down. The next morning I attempted to talk to him because I didn\u2019t want him to regret what happened because it made me feel bad. And I comfort people be just like placing a hand on them while I talk to them and he got really mad at that and I\u2019d do without thinking and he said \u201cdon\u2019t make me hurt you\u201d. He pushed me so hard I almost fell off the bed and could have hit my head on the edge of a table but i grabbed on to his arm. I wouldn\u2019t let him leave his room because he was really heated and irrational. And he began to shove me and grabbing me and like grabbed me by my shoulders near my throat and shook me a little. And then he punched a hole in the closet right in front of my face. After that i had a mental breakdown and i lost myself completely. He started to record me and asking me to leave and i wouldn\u2019t and i was begging him to just talk to me and to stop recording because I was embarrassed. He was like dragging me out of the house but I was fighting back and going back in. I was being completely insane. I really was. I was so gone. I was having a terrible breakdown. And I told him to stop touching me and that I\u2019d leave on my own but he grabbed me and shoved me out. And I\u2019m just so embarrassed. I begged him to delete the videos but he said he\u2019s keeping the evidence. I\u2019m embarrassed of my actions and how toxic I was. Because of stuff like that ^ and because I\u2019d call him crying and begging him to talk to me because I was losing my mind. I was so confused. Because I\u2019d try so much but if I did something he\u2019s done he\u2019d get mad at me and cut me off. I was just as bad as him. Maybe worse. I\u2019m just really sad of who I became when I was with him. I could never do anything. He\u2019d say I was ruining things. When I\u2019d call him out for doing things he\u2019d yell at me that we weren\u2019t in a relationship and he doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019d tell at me to stop talking to guys and when I\u2019d want to address it he\u2019d laugh and say \u201cyou need to chill. You\u2019re making it into a big deal. I was just joking.

He will step on whoever he has to running to get what he wants.\n\nHe has bipolar disorder and I took care of him when he couldn't take care of himself. I did his laundry, I cooked for him, I cleaned his house and I even got him to a free clinic because he didn't have insurance so that he could get back on his meds to show proof of treatment in the last 90 days for SSI. He just recently got approved and tried to pay me back the money that I spent during our relationship which was around $1,200 and probably more.\n\nI told him to just keep it because I want nothing to do with him. He tried to texting me asking me for my ZIP code and we both know that you don't need a zip code for an e transaction such as PayPal, only their email address.

She came over to his house where we were hanging out and asked if she could spend a few nights there basically whether I was there or not because unfortunately her husband is abusing her as well. She took it a step further after leaving his house and asked if they could move in together. She knows that he was with me at the time and I feel that it was very inappropriate for her to be asking those kinds of questions.\n\nI understand that she wants out of her situation but still that was inappropriate.

I'm sure he knows why I'm upset and just wants to try to make me out to be the bad guy.\n\nHe spends way too much time with her for it to just be a friendship and also like I said the inappropriate stuff that she was asking but yet I'm the one in the wrong for suspecting him of cheating. I know that narcissist will triangulate people and try to make you out to seem like the controlling one but it still hurts me what he's done to me.\n\nI'm continuing to ignore all of his attempts to get a hold of me. I know that I'm better off without him because he was and unemployed drunk when I met him who had nothing and I know he will be again if he follows down the same path he's on. This woman that I speak of is heavily into drugs and I feel like it's only a matter of time before he gets pulled over with her with her having drugs in the car and he goes to jail and loses his check.\n\nI know that all I can do is continue to move forward and continue to ignore his attempts to contact me but I still feel depressed because I did a lot for him out of love and this is how he repays me.

I wish that we had been happy, been healthy. I was supposed to be the one who was different and now we\u2019ll never be able to be in the same room again. but we weren\u2019t happy or healthy, we were abusive and awful for each other and it hurt all the time but fuck, i wish things could have been better. I wanted them to be. But you shouldn\u2019t have to \u2018make it work\u2019. Sure, you work on things and put in effort (something I admittedly stopped doing) and work through issues and obstacles but you shouldn\u2019t have to /make/ the dynamic work. I wish I could have been in love with you in the end. I wanted us to end up together. We were supposed to have a family and grow old together and now we\u2019re both gonna do those things with other people and it fucking hurts me to know that I\u2019ll never get to see you do that. I miss you. I\u2019m not saying I regret breaking up, I don\u2019t, but I wish it would have ended differently. We could have been friends. It could have been better, a clean break, a \u2018thanks for all the memories, go out and do good\u2019 kind of thing. Instead you bailed on me with four fucking days notice and moved in with your \u2018friends\u2019 (a rapist and a bunch of rape apologists who you constantly talked shit on and claimed not to care about) and that hurts me. You either never believed me about the rape or you did and you\u2019re just fine with the fact that your homeboy is a rapist. I never should have been with aaron. I did a shitty thing, was shitty in every way possible not hay situation and for that I\u2019m sorry. I never should have got drunk at that party. There were a lot of things I never should have done.

I wanted us but then I fell out of love with you and I want you to know that I never meant to. I\u2019m angry at you and I know you feel the same but I want you to know that I want better for you than I gave you and better friends and for you to get some fucking mental healthcare and I want you to be happy. I doubt you want me to be happy. That\u2019s fine. I think you\u2019re my karma for all I did before you and I was yours. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a bad person, but I think you were bad for me and I think the same is true in my case. I was awful for you, and a ways into the relationship I started to be awful to you and I\u2019m sorry about all of that. I\u2019m sorry I pushed my own bullshit on you. I want it to be clear that I am sincerely and genuinely apologizing and I also want to be clear that I have not forgiven you yet for all the ways you hurt me. Maybe I never will. You\u2019ll probably never forgive me and I get that and that\u2019s fine. I just want you to get help, get better, be happy. I want you to find someone who loves you better than I ever did. I want you to love them better than you ever loved me. I want it to be healthy and happy and reciprocated and communicative and intense. I want good for you, even after everything. And I know that you\u2019ll probably show this to your friends and they\u2019ll talk shit on me and you may join in and that your family probably hates me and I get it. but if I don\u2019t address that I am also hurting, also grieving, I\u2019ll never start to heal. we were not each other\u2019s soulmates, we were life lessons and that fucking sucks. and maybe I have no right to feel the way I do but I think I do. I don\u2019t regret us. I don\u2019t regret you.

You left some shoes and a washcloth and I want you to know it\u2019s all gonna live in a box with our fucking pictures and someday I\u2019ll dig it out and look back and smile but for now I am in so much pain. Snapchat shows me memories of us every day and some days I cry and some days I laugh and some days I do both but it brings me some small comfort that we\u2019re already months out and with everyday we get one step closer to finally being okay. I want to be okay. \n\n\n\nEdit one. \n\nSo i got a text from a random person. With the same letter. Will they keep doing this till I respond? Because im definitely not going to. \n\nEdit two. \n\nSame letter. But she added more at the end. Ill post what she added under here. \n\n\nThanks for all the good, fuck you for all the bad. Fuck me for my part, too. I hope neither of us are ever in a relationship like ours ever again. I hope you know that I did love you. I hope you fall in love again, but this time in love with the person, not the idealized version of them you painted in your head. No more manic pixie dream girls for you and no fucking more of being a manic pixie dream girl for me. Maybe someday, years from now we can grab coffee and reminisce and think \u2018what a crazy, beautiful time\u2019 but that also may never happen and either way is fine. Some bridges should stay burned and we\u2019ll see if this is one of them or not. I hope you get better. I am sorry, truly, deeply, for all the pain i caused you but I hope that doesn\u2019t erase your memories of the good. I have so many photos, if you ever want any let me know. I hope griffin is okay. Drew is sick, I think it\u2019s stress and I hope to god he gets better soon. Life is different. You and I are both growing into different versions of ourselves and someday soon we won\u2019t even be able to say we know each other anymore. The good in us didn\u2019t outweigh the bad and I\u2019m sorry that I went into our relationship with such a warped idea of what love looked like. We both deserved better and someday we\u2019ll have it. Take care of yourself.

I\u2019ve never had an escalated argument with anyone ever prior to meeting my narc. How?

He will tell me what to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I don\u2019t always listen, but he\u2019s so pushy about it so I do whatever he says just to shut him up. He always wants me to bring leftovers for lunch so we don\u2019t \u201cwaste any food.\u201d However, two nights ago he was making a sandwich and I told him to bring leftovers. I told him, \u201cyou always tell me to bring leftovers for lunch, so why aren\u2019t you bringing them.\u201d Mind you, I\u2019m trying to cook dinner for myself and make my own lunch. Our kitchen is small so I generally ask him to stay out of my way when I\u2019m in there. I love to cook and bake and he just gets in the way - of which he knows - but surprise, surprise.... he never listens. \n\nHe starts waving turkey in my face and putting lemon juice down my shirt. Apparently I\u2019m overly-emotional for getting upset about it. I yell, he yells, and I end up sleeping on the couch even though it\u2019s MY bed. \n\nThe next morning I politely tell him that I\u2019m still upset with him. I concede and say that it\u2019s reasonable if he\u2019s mad at me for yelling and \u201cmaking a scene\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean what he did was right. Never ONCE during the entire text argument that ensued did he apologize. He justified his actions with my anger. It was my fault. I didn\u2019t need to escalate it. He was just trying to lighten the mood and be silly and make me laugh. I kept telling him to stop before I got angry but he didn\u2019t. Yet, he gets upset at me because he keeps telling me to stop being upset and I won\u2019t. Anyone else see the hypocrisy here? \n\nWhat a stupid thing to fight over; leftovers... It\u2019s always been this way. He holds a specific standard for me but if I hold him to the same standard, it becomes WWIII and \u201cwoe is me\u201d and \u201cget off my balls\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re suffocating me\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m miserable.\u201d \n\nI tell him to move out or I will FIVE times yesterday alone. I am so done being \u201ctoo emotional.\u201d I\u2019m sick of having \u201canger management issues.\u201d I\u2019m so fucking tired of giving up my right to fair and equal treatment for the person whom I\u2019m supposed to trust the most.\n\nYet I\u2019m still here and still scared to leave.

Also, this is my first time posting here, so here goes. TW mentions of emotional, sexual, and physical abuse. \n\nFor some background, I'm a woman. I was in a three year relationship with a man in my early 20s that was an absolute psycho. He was cruel and manipulative. I liken him to someone pulling the legs off a bug just to see what would happen. He was my first real relationship and he broke me. Completely threw my normal meter off. He wasn't terribly physical, but emotionally and sexually abusive. I eventually left him, good riddance. \n\nI dated for a bit after the psycho, but I wasn't healthy, and I recognize that now. I was basically empty, and trying to prove that I was capable of being loved, even though I really didn't feel like I had any to give. \n\nEventually I met a man who I was actually interested in. We wound up dating the better part of 7 years. We had an intense relationship that almost immediately wound up being long distance. We would live together in the summers, and eventually lived together full time for three years. He was a wonderful, sweet, loving man, unless he was angry. At which point he was a completely different person. He'd call names, yell, use any insecurity or fear I had against me. He'd physically restrain me, throw me into things, and throw stuff around, etc. He was also emotionally negligent, but I wouldn't realize that for a very long time.\n\nThe thing is, while it initially scared me, I'm no shrinking violet. I started yelling back, I'd call names, I'd push back. Eventually we break up because I realise he's not terribly aware of things that are important to me, and I'm only holding on because of when he's nice to me. \n\nWe try dating again, but in my heart, there's just no forgiveness. He's not hitting me anymore, but he still doesn't know how to deal with his feelings. He steals my shoes so I can't leave, he yells at me while I lay curled on the bed. He pulls back in fear when I reach for my phone that he's taken from me. I think he's pathetic for it. Mostly because he's the physical one.\n\nAnd he was the physical one. But that thought keeps nagging at me. In what ways have I been shaped by these men? I can remember a high school boyfriend getting frustrated at something and slamming a cabinet closed and yelling. I thought the reaction was so ridiculous, I teased him about it. I wonder what that girl would think of the woman I've become, the things I've done. Because I've done things I'm ashamed of. I've said mean and nasty things. I've been in more or less wrestling matches with a man. I've screamed and cried and held someone I'd said \"I love you\" to not hours before in utter contempt. \n\nI know now that I was just so happy that 2 wasn't 1 that I accepted lots of things I never should have, but we're all just products of our experiences, and my adult life has been shaped by men telling me they loved me, yet not acting like they did. So here I am, in my 30s, and I'm absolutely terrified of dating. I'm not afraid of being hurt again, because, while I think abusive relationships can happen even to the best prepared, I think my normal meter is back. What I'm afraid of is that I've turned into a monster. I know what I'm capable of. What if I hurt someone who is kind and good the way I've been hurt?\n\nI know that I've worked on tools on how to deal with conflict, that I'm more educated and mature in handling conflict, because I'd worked on them in an attempt to salvage my last relationship. But those all developed in a toxic environment, so they're, at best, theoretical. So here I am, scared that I'm going to be unable to implement them in a healthy relationship. I know that it's not rational,  but I can't help but think about it. Maybe it is rational, I don't know. \n\nTl;dr I dated abusers through my 20s, and I'm afraid I might have picked up their habits in my 30s.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

To make things worse, I have ruined myself financially to the point where I bought a house that I can\u2019t afford without him and only my name is on the house.\n\nTo get a better understanding of my narc husband, here are some things that he has done to me (also note that he has two kids (9F/10M) that we have every other week):\n\n* He calls me names such as bitch and devil in front of the kids -I have to cater to the kids every needs (Open the door for them, change in MY closet if they are in MY room and I want to change, and I am the one in charge for paying for all of their gifts) \n* We have separate bank accounts but I have to bail him out every time he forgets to pay a bill or if he spent all of his money on useless crap and if I don\u2019t then I\u2019m not fully committed to the marriage (He would forget to pay the mortgage and spend the money so I will have to pay the mortgage for him and I HE will pay me back whenever HE feels like it) \n* He has constant double standards (He needs to come home to a completely clean house but If I come home after him, there are numerous piles of dog shit and piss that he waits for me to clean) \n* He pressures me into having sex with him because he doesn\u2019t want to \u201cretire his dick\u201d (Suffer PTSD from a rape before I met him)\n* I was hospitalized for cardiac issues due to stress, had several panic attacks and pissed myself I was panicking due to 8 different attempts to insert an IV into and when the nurse asked him to give me his hand for comfort, he just held me down so I couldn\u2019t move\u2026 Scaring me more\n* While I was in the hospital, the nurse picked up on his actions and didn\u2019t feel comfortable sending me home.\n\nAnd the cherry on top\n\nHe blames me for the reason why his kids don\u2019t want to see him. He told me that the house is always messy and no one feels like they are \u201chome\u201d. I know I\u2019m not the cleanest person, but I mop every other day, pick up anything on the ground. Sure I may forget or miss something but the house is far from being messy. It\u2019s only messy if I\u2019m not there.\n\nTo wrap all of this up, I bought a house for him and the kids that I can no longer afford nor can I even afford to sell it! I want to move far away from here but I can\u2019t because I don\u2019t even know what to do about the fucking house! I just want to default on it and let the bank take it away and move to a different country\u2026\u2026 I am so exhausted and tired. I have a habit of SH and I am completely afraid of relapsing. I have no friends or family here, it is just me and my pups.\n\nAny advice would help, I know what I need to do but it\u2019s hard to finally break away, especially when I will be financially ruined.\n\nI'm so sorry for the long post/rant :(", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

As a teenager, I yearned for the day I could escape \"home\", live independently, have the life that I so desperately craved, and achieve my goals despite the chaos I had became adapted to.\n\nI wasn't always filled with great determination, I found myself struggling more than my peers emotionally, and contemplating suicide at the early of age of just 12 years old. I attempted to do so in the next four years in various forms; self-harm, repeated overdoses, failed attempts to hang myself, trying to cut my throat, and obsessing over stepping in front of the trains that ran along 377. \n\nI was diagnosed with depression shortly before my 13th birthday, just three years after my sister had caught my mother's husband at the time, sexually molesting me on her 17th birthday. I was only 9 years old. I denied he was doing anything wrong, not wanting to ruin her birthday and full of fear after he had made threats before to keep quiet. My sister knew what she had witnessed, seeing the color drain from my face. It was within moments after her pleads to tell her what was going on, that I told her everything. The years it had gone on. The \"rewards\" of candy. The fear that I had that he would hurt my mom, my dad, and my sister. I was terrified, but I could finally breathe.\n\nSpeaking up to my mom wasn't an option in my mind. Her husband beat her regularly, and I spent countless times crouched in my bathroom sink with the door locked, trembling as I clutched our house phone set on 911, ready to push the dial button once I couldn't handle the screams and her pleading for him to stop, anymore. I would vomit at the sounds of his fists laying into her or using whatever object was nearby, her thrown against their bedroom walls, dragged by her hair, and her screams. Cops were always turned away as she always protected him. She had a short fuse as well, and took her anger out on me. It wasn't uncommon for her to be hitting me at an early age, digging her nails into the inside of my upper arms, using hangers on me while I was balled up on the floor, and nonstop verbal abuse. She filled with rage when I would wet the bed, (not taking into account as a sign of possible sexual abuse in children) would grab the back of my head and shove my face into my own urine soaked sheets as if I were a dog. I walked on eggshells daily, cleaned the house so she wouldn't be angry after coming home from a long day at work, making her bed, or folding her load of laundry she hadn't had a chance to get to. I tried anything to appease her - but it wasn't ever enough. I would get hit while cowering on the kitchen floor for not folding the towels the way she folded them, and other minute things. When my mother was told by my sister what her then-husband had been doing to me, I was called into the living room and called a liar. It wasn't until she confronted him and he confessed to her, that she then believed me.\n\nTelling my Dad wasn't an option for me either. I have always been a daddy's girl and didn't want to hurt him. We spent every other weekend at the park, riding bike trails all over town, going to the movies, shown how to play numerous sports. He was there at every single soccer game I had. I couldn't confide in him what I could barely comprehend myself and the sexual assaults that were taking place.\n\nMy sister wasn't an option before that dreadful day. She also suffered the traumas I endured, battling depression, and spending most of her teenage years missing as a runaway, dabbling with drugs, or in rehab. She couldn't wait to get the hell away from my mom. She never left my side again after confiding in her.\n\nMy mom reported her husband to police, however, continued her relationship with this monster and allowed him to keep living at home. It wasn't until CPS became involved and began their investigation that she was told he either had to leave the home, or face consequences by the eyes of the law. He left to a nearby hotel, and she brought him a plate of homemade dinner every night. After I begged for her to divorce him, she replied that one day, I will \"understand what love is.\"\n\nHe served only one year in prison followed by 10 years of probation. A sentence I felt was so minimal for the pain and YEARS of assaults I endured in silence, countless birthdays I wished he would stop as I blew out my candles, endless prayers begging God to make it all stop and save me, the childhood I was robbed of. I was angry, confused, furious. I didn't understand how God let this happen. How could the police, investigators and most of all the justice system, minimalize and fail me more than ever before? I didn't matter, I wasn't important. The tension grew between my mom and I after he was sent to prison, and the financial stability she had, dwindled. I spent the next few years trying to escape what I only knew as my own living Hell, letting my grades slip, becoming promiscuous, and seeking what I now know as a contorted form of validation and lack of self-esteem.\n\nI wish I could go back in time to stand up for that little girl who was too afraid to scream. To tell her that I heard her cries for help. That she endured hardships that would one day help other survivors of abuse. That she didn't deserve any of this, and would grow up to be stronger than she ever imagined, becoming resilient, and having a family of her own that she always wished she had. I wish I could tell her to make the right choices because she deserved the best from life, and no one on this earth who hurt her was worth giving the power to dictate her own happiness in life. I wish I could tell her she was loved and worthy. But I am proud of the nurturing, compassionate, woman and mother I taught myself to become.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

So naturally, they never let me get a job. On my 18th birthday, my dad threw out a bunch of my stuff and said if I didn't go to college, he'd kick me out. I had no plans to attend college since my grades were shit, but I wanted to become a hair stylist or something. I never cared about being rich; I just wanted to do something I liked and be able to survive off of it, you know?\n\nBut I had no choice. My parents paid for all my community college fees and they hold it against me every day. But it's like, if they forced me to go, then obviously they'd be paying for it? Why would I pay for myself after being forced to go? Especially when they know I have no money to my name?\n\nAnyway, once I started going to college, it was like a switch flipped. My parents started talking to me like they actually cared about me, but I'm an idiot for believing them for even a second. My personality is like... I can't hold a grudge. I move on from things quickly and that's part of the reason why my parents keep treating me like shit.\n\nMy major is psychology and I really want to become a psychiatrist. I know it's not cheap, nor is it a degree I'll earn quickly, but my parents aren't obligated to pay for my tuition at this point because it's my choice to continue with my education now.\n\nOne thing to note about my parents is that they both work in the medical field, focusing on physical health. My mom's an RN and my dad is a CLS. They don't think mental illness/mental health is real. Yes, they're ignorant Asian Indian parents. That's why they're so against me studying psychology. My dad's been trying to force me to become a CLS like him which pisses me off. He thinks everything is so easy as long as he's paying for it and that I have no right to complain. I want to ask him, who's going to be driving to school? Sitting in long lectures? Losing sleep because they have so much shit to study? Who has to maintain a good GPA? Does he think I'm going to put in all that effort for a major I DON'T WANT?\n\nAnyway, my dad was saying how he wouldn't pay for my tuition if I kept going with psychology, and then he went off on a tangent about how I didn't have any plans in life. That really fucking got to me. It's not that I don't have plans in life... It's just that my plans are never satisfactory to my parents.\n\nTo make some money, I decided to get a job at McDonald's. Next thing I know, my dad took my car keys and said he would drop me off at school from now on and that I shouldn't work when I'm in school. (I will get my associates degree in psychology by December so I'm still attending community college.)\n\nI was furious. I literally have ONE class each day, four days a week this semester. I HAVE SO MUCH FREE TIME. I just want to make some money so I can at least say I'm independent from my parents when I apply to universities later this year when I try to transfer, and he doesn't even want me to do that. He doesn't want me to have the slightest bit of independence. It's so frustrating how him and my mom think so highly of themselves and their own opinions... They literally know nothing about me, what kind of person I am, what my thoughts are, etc. Where are they getting their confidence from when they pretend like they know what's best for me? You can't know what's best for someone if you don't fucking know them.\n\nAnd my mom just makes things worse by constantly running her mouth. When my dad is pissed at me for simply existing, she adds fuel to the fire. I literally can't remember a day since I started high school where I wasn't teetering between thoughts of killing my parents and killing myself. I went through periods where I self-harmed but I had stopped sophomore year of high school. But now that I'm at a stressful point in my life where I need to make sure I do well in school, get letters of recommendations together, and start making money, I literally can't stop thinking about killing myself. I can't escape these thoughts. I hate who I've become... It's like I'm a shell of myself. I don't talk to anyone anymore and it's like I'm slowly accepting this \"identity foreclosure,\" but at the same time, I know I can prevent my life from being ruined by my parents if I just end it all. This is how twisted I've become. I'd rather fucking kill myself than let my parents control the course of my life.\n\nI really don't know what to do. I turn 20 in April and I'm so embarrassed to say I'm being controlled by my parents at this age when most people my age are already living on their own. Not that I think I have to be like them, but I just don't have any freedom. I really don't get it. I was never a troublesome child even though my grades were bad in high school (Cs and Ds, mostly), but my parents still haven't gone a day without abusing me. It switched from physical to emotional as I got older, though.\n\nAh, fuck. I'm so tired of this already.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

So I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense. \n\nA bit of backstory: I have been in emotionally and physically abusive relationships in the past and have a very hard time understanding how/when to do what's best for me, like when to leave and when to understand I'm being taken advantage of. I've stayed with broken people because I felt like they deserved to be loved, they deserved to be helped, they deserve to have everything they want, and I never thought about what I deserve or what is best for me. I had a friend recently call it a bit of a \"savior complex\" that I didn't realize I have (Probably due to being abandoned as a kid and abuse growing up, so now I want to be perfect for everyone else). I am ALWAYS BUSY because I have no ability to say No to people when they want to do something, or are having problems, I'll drop everything I'm doing to go help them. But it doesn't add to my constant anxiety I'm trying to work through. And the majority of my exes have been extremely controlling, down to telling me I can't wear make up without unless I'm seeing them, or what kind of shoes I'm allowed to wear, or clothes. Ffs man I never, EVER thought I'd be this woman, but looking back on my relationships I've allowed myself to be controlled and abused by the majority of them to the point where I no longer understand what's a healthy level of dependency or not.   \n\nI'm in the process of leaving an extremely co-dependent, three year relationship to a man I truly care for. Everyone has their own problems and their own baggage, but our entire relationship was based on me taking care of him and his baggage, his mental illnesses, his *constant* emergencies that happened daily, his constant break downs, just constant fires I was putting out day after day, while ignoring my own issues and traumas that have resurfaced this past year and a half and working full time the entire relationship (He just started working full time/consistently a year ago). It got so bad I no longer was even telling him when I would have a panic attack (not too often, but they do come), when I'd wake up from nightmares crying I wouldn't bother waking him because eventually it'd get turned around and be about him. \n\nThis probably sounds like I'm crazy, but I swear... I'd have a panic attack or become triggered by something, and within 24 hours he'd be having a similar one, it almost felt like he was having them *because* I had one before and now it wasn't about him. That sounds harsh, but there truly was no time for me and my issues. So eventually I just...stopped letting him see when I'd break down. Which ffs I know I have a lot of baggage myself and I'm *trying*, I really am trying to work through them, but there was simply no time to. I'm struggling with trying to over-come self mutilation, eating disorders, (un-diagnosed but hinted at by my last therapist) slight ptsd probably, and though I took the time to learn about his triggers, his traumas, joined support groups for his needs, he never did the same for me. When I called him out on this he read one article on rape survivors and came to a strange, half-assed conclusion that he was supposed to just...not talk about it at all and avoid it?? I'm not sure. \n\nWell, the entire time we were together, as I mentioned, he was extremely co-dependent and in the beginning I thought it was just him being in love with me and wanting to be with me and it'd fade over time once the honeymoon phase ended. It didn't. Before I knew it, we had gone an entire YEAR without spending a SINGLE night apart (**not** by my choice). Every time I'd suggest he stay in his house (rather than do the constant sleep overs back and forth between our homes) he'd say he \"doesn't like being alone\" and my stupid savior complex jumped in just trying to make things better and didn't want him to be upset, so I'd cave instead of listening to my gut saying this was becoming a problem.\n\nHe'd come with me to all my after work activities even though he had NO interest and would introvert the entire time, which would cause me a bit of anxiety because he seemed down at all these events and I'd spend more than half my time checking in with him and seeing if he was okay, because he would act and respond in such a negative and down way to having to be out and around people, that even other people would frequently come up to me and ask if he was okay or mad. When I'd have friends over, he'd ignore them completely and act like they weren't there, which was upsetting to me and my friends because it's rude. \n\nThen I got involved in a weekly book club where it wasn't entirely appropriate for me to bring him as a tag-along each time, so I told him unless he was participating he couldn't go anymore. That turned into months of \"Well I'M not invited and I can't go\" negative type attitude. \n\nWhen I'm out at events he'd always be asking when I was coming home and always insisted on having dinner with me. Partially because he can't cook for himself and partially because he values dinner time and wanted to spend that time with me. \n\nIf I'd have drinks at a gal friends house and want to just crash instead of driving home, he'd pitch a fit about \"well I can just come get you and you can get your car tomorrow\" even though it'd be highly inconvenient to do so.  One time when it was my best friends 25th birthday we went out for drinks and ubered there and back, when we got back I was waaaay too drunk to drive home (it was the first night I discovered I CAN'T mix alcohol, ugh) and told him I'd be staying there. He then insisted on coming to get me, even after the point where my phone died before I could give him the address and he just showed up in the middle of the night to pick me up after driving around enough until he remembered where she lived. \n\nI took one trip for 4 days with friends and he basically ignored me the entire time.\n\n\nHe wanted me to give him my schedule of activities in advance and if I popped anything up last minute he'd become upset I didn't tell him about it. \n\n\nIf I didn't stay in bed with him when he was asleep on weekends until he woke up to wake up together he'd punish me by being mean and grouchy the entire morning (he enjoys us waking up together). It was his way, or the grumpy way. He always said he didn't realize he was doing it, or he'd say he wasn't behaving that way and make me feel like I was making it all up, or reacting for no reason.\n\nI could list many, many more examples but I think I rambled enough, you get the point I hope. He was extremely co-dependent on me for a very, very long time. \n\nDue to reasons beyond this, we are currently breaking up. I told him a couple days ago that I'm not satisfied in this relationship and that the co-dependency was too much. I was hurting myself again, I'm drinking almost every night, and my past traumas are coming back up to surface and I don't even think I *should* be in a relationship until I get past them, or at least get a hold on them.\n\nI officially left the house Monday, we're seeing each other tomorrow for dinner before I go into see his therapist (whom I love) on his request, then we're spending another week in no contact, and going in to see the therapist together next week. I tried to leave the relationship but he was having a hard time accepting it, so I'm hoping to spend tomorrow learning how to properly tell him it's over and work through it in the last session. \n\nI'm staying with my friend until I get on my feet and I keep feeling anxious about everything though. I went out to tea with a friend and felt like I had to text her saying where i was and when I'd be back and felt extremely guilty because she'd be home before me. Then today a friend is having problems and needs advice and I feel... scared (?) to ask(?) the friend I'm staying with if it's okay if I go out. My brain is telling me I just don't want to be rude and come back late and disrupt her sleeping or anything like that, but I surprised myself at how anxious and worked up I've been getting myself all day over this. And then I realized that any thoughts of going out without asking if she would join me is making me extremely anxious and guilty. But if I'm to stay with her for the next couple months I don't think I can continue living with my busy schedule and this level of anxiety about it. \n\nI'm scared this feeling isn't going to go away anytime soon. I'm scared I'll bring this anxiety into my next relationship. I don't ever, **ever** want to feel trapped again and I don't know how to over-come this feeling on my own. \n\nThe therapist is his therapist that he sees weekly and I don't have any type of insurance, so when we are officially done, I won't have this access to therapy and that scares me too. \n\nSo yeah, I'm really sorry for the long and probably confusing word vomit of a post this is. my **TL;DR** would be this: I've dated controlling people my entire life and now I don't know how to stop feeling anxious like someone is going to try and control me again. Any advice from people who've been in similar situations would be appreciated, thank you again and sorry for the word vomit.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I have been debating on wether I should post this (and mods: please feel free to remove this if it doesn\u2019t belong here), but I was wondering about the people who got discarded for the first time: did you immediately know this wasn\u2019t a normal break up or how long did it take you to realize you just got discarded? \n\n\nYou don\u2019t really need to read this, but this is my story:\nWith my Nex I immediately knew something wasn\u2019t right. Our whole relationship was basically a huge dumpster fire which I desperately tried to put out while he kept adding gasoline. I was pretty sheltered for the past few years due to suffering from bad PTSD (caused by abuse) and agoraphobia which made it easy for him to normalize all of the wrongs. \u201cThat\u2019s what the real world is like\u201d \u201cEveryone does that, you just don\u2019t know because you\u2019re inside all the time\u201d. I got involved in dangerous shit because of him, since he was always raging and ready to fight somebody just because they looked at him. He had a bad porn/sex addiction and also huge problems with consuming alcohol and drugs, but always tried to tell me that this was normal- and indeed, his whole inner circle was like that. When he raped me and I confronted him about it, he told me he already talked about it with his friends and all of them (including his female friends) reassured him that I was just being to sensitive and overreacting.\n\nMy discard happened after he got me involved in a situation with one of his drug dealer buddies, which basically ended in me having continuous panic attacks and fainting spells and having intense flashbacks for the rest of the weekend. I asked for some time by myself to recover and wanted to talk to him on Thursday, just to explain the situation. I was going through hell, even got admitted to the hospital due to being so physically ill from not sleeping/eating/drinking for over 78 hours. This was my personal rock bottom. Well, on Wednesday he spontaneously came over to my house (he\u2019s my next door neighbor which makes the situation even worse), under his arm all of my books, dvds and my tea kettle. I immediately knew that shit was about to go down. He wanted to sit me down and for 1 and a half hours told me explicitly each and every little flaw I ever displayed, using my PTSD and his knowledge about it against me, making me look like I was some sort of lunatic and every time I tried to get up and tell him to go home, he yanked my arm demanding I need to listen to this because it was all my fault the relationship didn\u2019t work out. He told me the days by myself (in which he gave me the silent treatment) were actually a test to see if I actually cared about him and give him attention even if I wasn\u2019t feeling well- and I failed miserably. He even admitted he was afraid I would try to break up with him on Thursday. The whole time he was making himself out to be the shining hero who spotted my flaws and who needed to save himself from me, telling me all his friends thought I was a bad influence on him, but demanded to keep him updated on my therapy and stay in close contact, even suggesting we could still kiss, cuddle and be intimate. Then he got up and on the way outside even told my room mate how relieved he now feels.\nIt didn\u2019t feel like a breakup but rather like getting thrown off a boat, stripped of everything you ever thought was your own personality. I questioned myself. I didn\u2019t know who I was anymore. I felt so humiliated and worthless like never before.\n\nI only started to notice his narcissistic traits one at a time after we talked again at the end of the week and he gaslighted me when I asked about his immoral FWB suggestion, saying he never wanted something like that and my crazy brain was starting to make things up. This is when I started researching NPD and everything started to make sense. Out of the 100 point check list for narcissism he scored a whooping 94. \n\nJust to reassure everyone: I\u2019ve been NC ever since, even though the hoover attempts are horrible and inevitable due to being neighbors and getting triggered everytime I hear about his new supply. It\u2019s been one month and I am going into an inpatient treatment next week to work on breaking the trauma bond and recover with a specialist.

My emotionally abusive ex is a 20 year old female. We broke up in mid-2017 for the final time and I told her that was that. I don't want to go into details because we'd probably be here all day, but I've been in therapy on and off since 2016 as a result of this relationship. She gaslighted the absolute crap out of me. I lost 11 kilograms during a period of 6 months when we weren't even together because she was relentlessly bullying me online (had her \"friends\" who didn't know me doing it as well). For reference, I went from 61kgs to 50kg and I'm 5ft 7!\n\nThe unfortunate reality of this is that I work with this girl still to this day although according to her we are \"friends\" and we have moved on from the bad parts of our past - the bad parts which were all, of course, my fault. What she did was warranted. Being emotionally involved with her long distance ex-girlfriend behind my back was apparently warranted as well.\n\nI'm just not sure how to move on from this pain. I feel so ashamed because I let this happen to me. It doesn't help that she's younger than me so the fact that it's so easy for people to believe that she was never capable of the things she did to begin with absolutely kills me. I think it's always assumed the power imbalance in a relationship with an age gap means the older person was the controlling one, but this wasn't the case. I adored her - I emphasized that we were equals from day one despite our age gap - I think I ended up overemphasizing it because there sure as hell wasn't a power balance or mutual respect by the end of it.

I feel kind of crazy whenever I think about the fact that I'm glad that he almost killed me, because looking back that's the only way I think I would have been willing to leave. \"Willing to leave\" isn't even the right way to put it; I wasn't thinking about anything when I got away, I was just scared. So now it's been almost a year, and I've gotten a lot better in a lot of little ways. If I focus on progress instead of the end result I can see it; I still have nightmares, but I don't wake up choking from his hands around my neck in my dreams stealing my breath as I sleep via panic attack, I still flinch sometimes when people go to touch me, but it's markedly better than it was when I first got home, I can stay home alone now, even though I'd usually rather not, I just started going to school, something I never thought I'd have the strength to do- there is definitely an abundance of evidence that I am getting better. But it's still hard to feel like I'm free sometimes; when life gets overwhelming and I can't breathe because I'm in my psychology class and my professor gives an example that hits a little too close to home, or when people ask me why I moved home and I just tell them, \"I broke up with my boyfriend,\" or when, in certain situations, it almost feels disingenuous to not share what happened but also you just can't find the words and you can't tell if it would be oversharing or appropriate but you feel like you aren't creating authentic connections because it's such a big part of you now and you hate that and you don't want to be too much. You know that if you're too much then people won't want to deal with you, because that's why your best friend since middle school bailed on being part of your support system when you got home, and you don't even blame her. It's a lot. You know.   \n\n\nSorry, this post has started to get away from me.   \n\n\nWhat I wanted to say is that it's been almost a year and he still hasn't been sentenced. He's just been sitting in jail, with the court date being pushed back month by month, so I haven't been able to work on the trauma that happened the weekend he was arrested because it might still go to trial. I've already had to do a preliminary hearing, which was basically just a trial without a jury. I had to take the stand and was questioned by the DA and his attorney. His family was there. He was there. That was in November. At the preliminary hearing, the judge approved all of the charges against him as valid for the prosecution to charge him with, basically that they had sufficient evidence to go forward with the case. He was charged with torture, kidnapping, false imprisonment, corporal injury on a spouse, criminal threats, and a handful of other charges that I honestly can't remember. I want this to be over. I want him either to take a plea deal or go to trial. I don't even care at this point. (That's not true, I'd rather he take a plea deal.) But either way, I just want it to be done so that I can work on the weekend that everything went down in therapy. I mean, I have plenty of other stuff to work on in therapy, he was abusive the entire year and a half that we were together, but not to the extent of what happened that weekend. I guess I just have this delusion that if I can work on that, then perhaps it will alleviate some of the constant underlying emotional discomfort that I feel. I want to feel anything other than deep fear, anxiety, and sadness, or just overwhelming relief. Those are my current highs and lows. I miss when my highs were positive emotions, rather than just reprieve from negative ones. I never thought that this would be easy, but it is so much harder than I could have ever known, and I have an extremely strong support system in my family and my boyfriend! I can't imagine what it would feel like to do this alone, that's why I'm planning on going into community outreach as a career path, possibly.

{"post_id": "avq48b", "created_utc": 1551353684, "title": "Identifying Emotional and Physical Abuse ?", "author": "saturday2218", "self_text": "Hi everyone.  I'm sorry for how rambly this is.\n\n I'm currently going through a pretty massive life change and as I process it, some things are coming up and I just wondered if anyone had any similar experiences or just could help me sort it out in any way. So my current husband who I am in the process of divorcing and finally seeking freedom from I believe strongly is emotionally abusive. I have come to this conclusions several times over the last ten years. He was my first everything when I was 15 and has stayed in my life pretty much since. Thanks to lots and lots of therapy and support I also finally had the lady balls to come out and acknowledge that this straight suburban military spouse life I have going on has been a complete lie. I wanted to be wanted so badly, I wanted to please him so badly,  but last year I was so overwhelmed in this lie and situation I tried to end my life. And now finally a year lady I have the courage to seek out my own REAL happiness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess I have two questions for you\n\n1. How severe or frequent does something need to be to be counted as physical abuse?\n\n My husband has never full blown hit me. But now that I am processing this so much is kind of coming to light. First being when we were young, around 16- I was having a panic attack in public and he grabbed my wrists as hard as he could to make me stop. Later on at 21 I flew out to visit him (we were friends at the time), and I had dumped some of his laundry out on the ground to use a laundry basket. When he came home he was so angry that I was disrespecting him and we got into an argument outside. He pushed me.  Two years ago we were on a road trip and I couldn't sleep. I started getting extremely anxious and upset and frustrated that my insomnia was coming back. I was whining about it which I shouldn't have done but he pushed my head into a pillow trying to smother me to stop. He stopped and felt extremely extremely apologetic. Since getting married and being in the same house the other incident was when I had a really really intense PTSD reaction. I left the house and felt so strongly I needed to get away from him, like I was on autopilot.  I was triggered and then I kept going. He followed me to keep me safe. I was at a park and I was really really afraid of him, he got closer and I put my hands out to keep distance, he picked me up and slammed me against a bench knocking the wind out of me to make me stop. He was so apologetic then too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess. What is difficult is that I don't know what is abuse and what is protection? In some of our fights, which usually stem from my PTSD making him angry I have pushed him. I worry sometimes I'm the abuser. Can abusive people manipulate you into thinking that or does anyone have similar experiences??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2. What do you make of some of these situations? I am so worried that I am the manipulative one, I just still struggle with these because I don't think he is being malicious. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo being with my husband has always felt painful at some level. And for a long time I attributed this to mental illness because he never has looked at me and just said bad things, they are extremely extremely subtle and the control really truly seems from a place of love.  I have over the last year or so since us moving together literally began to question reality so hard and my sanity so hard that I tried to end my life and ended up in a psychiatric hospital (which I am grateful for because it started my actual healing). But both my mom (who I know definitvely to be abusive thanks to lots and lots of therapy) and him were my two main supporters through my recovery. It was uncomfortable because at this very deep level I felt like I couldn't trust either. During my outpatient program I came out, when I told my mom she completely dismissed it as a manifestation of illness. I mean COMPLETELY dismissed it. My husband did the same.  I just don't know what is manipulation and what are just normal parts of a relationship. Some examples are:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need to check in with him constantly, where I am and what I'm doing- he calls also several times when he is away to ask\n\nWhen we were apart before we got married and doing long distance he would constantly ask for sexual pictures, stories, etc. When I would try to say no or just say that I was with my family or something he would get upset.\n\nEvery weekend he starts the morning with \"here is the plan\" and whenever I oppose it's very \"well you don't ever plan anything\" or just I don't know how to explain it. I just feel like I have gotten fight fatigue and I have become the ultimate pushover. When asked what I want to do- I panic because I just never know.\n\nEverytime I do plan something- it is deemed cute or illogical. Kind of dismissed I guess, so much so I don't take any further steps. Also I'm a pretty go with the flow person at my core so I just don't have these extensive plans to begin with. \n\nI will be having visceral reactions to not wanting something and he still pushes me to do it using the framing that he is pushing me to grow or become better.  \n\nTime spent out of my routine really upsets him. And he questions it severely and is usually cause for upset.\n\nMy friend who was visiting just noticed this but when I am with my friends and away from him he starts to have problems. Like he called me asking where band aids were, and wanted me to come home to take care of him. He also all of a sudden doesn't feel well. \n\nALSO during the time our friends were here was when he pushed me over and over to tell him why I was distant and finally I told him that 1) I'm super gay and 2) We were going to need to seperate (  I said these things with extreme delicacy and care). While we were out with out friends he did things like mouth \"fuck you\" to me from across the table. He seperated me from the group and called me ungrateful and a bitch. He then took me outside where it was raining, away from our friends once again, to tell me I was a cunt, and all these other things. He kept telling me I didn't have to be such an asshole. I kept telling him I just wanted to go home and he followed me, yelling at me to stay. I told him to leave me alone and he got angry because I was \"making it look like something it wasn't\". It was horrible because he then started to cry and two hours later we were still in the rain no matter how many times I told him I wanted to go home. \n\nRecently I had a low week because of coming to terms with my sexuality and the need for seperation but just wasn't quite ready to tell him and some basic things around the house went without doing. He addressed them by pulling me aside and saying things like \"these are fundamentals of basic human decency\" and \"it doesn't matter where you are, you are an adult and it bothers me they don't bother you\" My lack of a desire to be a good housewife also causes a lot of issue. I have tried EXTREMELY hard to pretend like I enjoy it. \n\nHe focuses very much on how he wants to be the thing to make me happy, that he needs to be the sole thing to do so. Everything I do with him makes me feel anxious, nervous, and just unbelievably uncomfortable. I then feel guilty when they are nice things that shouldn't feel that way. I feel shame because I have started to realize he has stripped my joy of doing anything from all the things I used to love doing. Because I needed to be enjoying them for him. Constantly telling me to \"just smile\" or \"why can't you just laugh\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe also always tells me what to do instead of asking what I want to do. But sometimes they are nice things like calling me and telling me to go start a bath to relax.  Or telling me to go for a walk. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry this is a lot. I just hope any of it makes sense. Thank you so much for taking the time", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

{"post_id": "avrdcn", "created_utc": 1551362032, "title": "Why Abuse Survivors Stay in Abusive Relationships", "author": "Medi_Kate", "self_text": "There are many complex reasons to why abuse survivors stay in an abusive relationship. A lot of this has to do with the way survivors see themselves after the abuse, as well as the way society views them. \n\nHere are 5 reasons why it can be so difficult to leave an abusive relationship as told by Shahida Arabi in her book \"Becoming the Narcissists Nightmare..\" \n\n#1 Ending the relationship is associated with fear of retaliation &amp; anxiety. \nNarcissists do no respect boundaries or the need for space. Cognitive dissonance of who the abuser is and doubting causes the abuse survivor uncertainty about ending the relationship. Also, they may fear that the next person the abuser is with will be treated better and therefore, the feeling of worthlessness instilled by the abuser overwhelms the survivor. The want for closure from the narcissist is so strong though we know that will never happen. \n\n#2 Abuse survivors start to view themselves through the eyes of the abuser. \nBelittling, condescending remarks, &amp; physical violence leads to a sense of learned helplessness and self doubt. This makes survivors fearful that they really aren't as worthy as the think they are. They are subjected to an internal world of fear, self doubt, &amp; shaky self esteem as a result of the traumatic conditioning that their abusers put them through. Survivors are taught to live on a diet of breadcrumbs with the occasional compliments &amp; the shower of gifts &amp; flattery before the abuse cycle begins again which serves to remind them that they must work for a love that is conditional that will never contain real love, respect or compassion. As a result they may compare themselves to people who are in happier relationships, or seemingly idealize the ways their narcissist treated their ex. The narcissist either puts their exes on a pedestal or deems them as \"crazy\". The abuser subjects the victim to many comparisons to drive the point home that it is somehow the victims fault that he or she is being abused; also known as triangulation.\nSurvivors have a hard time with the realization that despite how confident, beautiful, happy or successful they are, they will always be abused because that's what abusers do in relationships. They do this because they enjoy the feeling of power and control, not because they lack merits. Narcissistic abusers enjoy bringing down anyone's accomplishments that they envy to reinforce their false sense of superiority. Survivors feel that ending the relationship would paradoxically confirm the abusers view of them due to the skewed belief system that the abuse has enforced on the victim.\nAbusers blow hot and cold throughout the relationship to make you feel like you're the problem and not them! Survivors struggle at winning the game of winning the abusers affection, especially if they are prone to people pleasing habits and fears of rejection and abandonment. \n\n#3 Ending the relationship would mean that the survivor has to reexperience all the traumas they went through on their own. \nAbuse survivors may feel better rationalizing the pain rather than facing the harsh reality. Survivors experience \"abuse amnesia\" during the good times which reinforces this. Abuse amnesia is a psychological protection from the survivor's own demons. They may experience defense mechanisms or dissociation which enables them to survive during moments of horrific abuse.\nStaying in the relationship allows the survivor to engage in the good parts of the relationship while psychologically protecting themselves from having to face the trauma of it. Narcissistic abusers use gaslighting, flattery, and even sex to create pleasurable bonds. Abuse amnesia is aided by the abuser's performances of being apologetic, kind, caring and compassionate during the positive highs of the abuse cycle.\nDissociation happens quite naturally for victims in the traumatic events. Trauma bonds have little to do with actual fulfillment, love, and respect, and everything to do with what we believe narcissists are. Breaking from the trauma bonds is even more difficult if previous trauma exists. Abuse becomes normalized due to what we have experienced in our childhood. Though may have never wanted to be like an abusive parent, they may have unconsciously picked up traits that are abusive. Psychological effects of witnessing domestic abuse in childhood is an example of this. Although it is extremely difficult to leave in this type of situation, the survivor finally has the time and space to face the effects that this trauma has had once the relationship is over. \n\n#4 Society shames survivors into thinking it is their fault for staying in the relationship. This creates barriers to a strong validating support network. \nAs a result of the stigmas of being and staying in an abusive relationship past the signs of blatant disrespect, many people who have not gone through abusive relationships themselves are prone to pass judgements upon survivors. Victim blaming, shaming and doubting isolates survivors in their abuse and alienates them from their own support networks. \"Why didn't you leave?\" can further force survivors to feel comfort by their abusive relationship because they would rather stay than reach out and risk being shamed, stigmatized, questioned by their \"supportive system\" (i.e friends, family, the justice system) or judged. \n***If society stopped judging and stigmatizing abuse survivors in such a negative way then victims might be able to actually report domestic abuse. They might be able to feel like they would not be alone after they left the relationship!***\nThose who have never been in an abusive relationship often have no clue what they are talking about and misrepresent strength as leaving. ABUSE SURVIVORS ARE OFTEN THE STRONGEST INDIVIDUALS!\nWhile being an abuse survivor may alienate us from society, it can also give us an intense connection with other survivors allowing us to have interactions filled with understanding and compassion. We have the ability to offer empathy and insight to others on a level that other individuals are not capable of. \n\n#5 The Survivor is not psychologically ready to leave. \nWe only stop a bad habit or behavior when the sake of pain outweighs any pleasure or reward. This plays true for the moment that survivors finally leave. Outside factors (financial, children, learned helplessness, physical threats) may also postpone the escape. \nNone of the best advice in the world can help us until we feel the inner transformation, until we have reached the turning point when we say \"I've had ENOUGH! I AM ENOUGH, and I am so much better than this.\" This moment often comes after an experience of extreme pain. The turning point where we have met our pain threshold. \nThe decision must come from the survivor and because he or she has been in the relationship for so long robbed of his or her own choices, it may be the first powerful choice they have made in a long time. After the action has been made and maintained by ***remaining No Contact*** you have gained the ultimate victory!!\n\n\n\nI hope these 5 reasons have helped you like they have helped me &amp; also provided you better insight on why abuse survivors stay &amp; why it's so hard to leave. Just know you are not alone &amp; things may be hard now but I truly believe &amp; trust that things CAN get better!! I never thought I'd be able to end the vicious cycle I was in with my nex, but that last reason has really resonated with me as I realized that ENOUGH IS ENOUGH! I wish the best for each &amp; everyone of you who have left an abusive relationship or have been struggling with leaving &amp; hope you find the strength within you to let go &amp; move forward towards full recovery! \n\nIf you have any questions, need advise, or just someone to listen please reach out!

We had a decent sex life so I never cared much to it.\n \nIt feels like my fault because I asked about it.

The word \"No\" only means no once, right? You just have to keep doing something enough and you can get anyone to accept anything! So what a bitch I am for calling him out, right?

When I questioned why, he told me he was having dinner with his ex-girlfriend, but they were just friends and wanted to have dinner since she was moving out of state. Monday morning when he called me, I voiced my concern about how it made me uncomfortable and he snapped. He started telling me that I was selfish, a dumbass, and stupid.  I got tired of hearing it so I hung up on him and ignored his calls and text demanding I answer the phone. He started texting me things like: \"I will block you from my phone\", \"We are over\", \"You needed to move on\", \"You just lost the best thing that ever happened to you\", and \"Don't ever contact me again\". My only reply was \"I will never contact you again\". He replied with laughing emojis and a peace sign. Then, I blocked him on my phone and social media.  He started calling and texting my phone. When he realized I blocked him on my phone, he started leaving voice messages apologizing.\" When he couldn't reach me on my phone, he started messaging my bff about how much he loves me and for her to please tell me. Then, he was emailing me apologizing saying he didn't mean those things and he loved me. (I had forgotten to spam his email address.) He begged me to call him before 4. I gave in and called him around 3. He was very apologetic and sounded sincere.  \n\nSince then, he has been messaging me and calling me constantly to tell me he loves. He has also been listening and sensitive to my hurt and concerns regarding the relationship. When he called me yesterday, he slipped up and said he only saw his ex twice this week: once for dinner Sunday night and the second was to visit before she left Monday night (the day he snapped at me).  In his slip up, I realized the reason he needed me to call before 4 was bc he was going visit his ex. I'm afraid he will get angry and it will ruin the compassionate, caring and loving things he has been saying and doing since the argument on Monday.  Now, I'm really unsure about the relationship and considering breaking up with him but I'm scared bc I don't want to hurt him, don't want him to blame me, and don't want him to become angry bc his temper scares me bc he becomes so cruel.\n\nAll of this made me start researching narcissism and now I have the question: Is he a narcissist and am I being manipulated? \n\nFyi: The S9 shows blocked calls in the call log notification and blocked messages in the blocked folder.

This sub helped give me forward momentum.  Things are going well for me, my two girls and husband.  We are on the right track and hope we will stay there. Beginning the first of January I have been attending a domestic violence support group for women.  That has been instrumental for me. Last month I told my husband I was thinking of divorce.  We had a very honest and forthright conversation that centered on the way he treats me.  I told him he is abusive. He didn't see it.  I explained again, but in a different way than before that abuse isn't just physical.  A week after that I told him he needed to do 3 things for me to consider staying. 1. Attend an 8 week parenting class with me.  2. Start back with his therapist to work on himself. 3. Attend a 24 week domestic abuse group for men.  A week after that conversation he  got nasty about something and then immediately afraid I was going to leave him over the mistake.  I told him he has a long walk ahead of him and inevitably he will fall back into old behaviors.  That being said, I said the abuse cycle we just had was the last one that I was going to be a part of.  When I start to see we are in the bad part of the cycle again, I am done.  We separated in 2017 for most of the year due to his emotional abuse.\n\nMy husband does not realize what he does.  He is just doing what his dad did and his dad before him.  That does not make it okay.  He still doesn't see why he needs to do the 24 week program.  I've told him it is not negotiable.  The changes in my family are remarkable.  My husband is developing the tools he needs to have successful relationships with me and his daughters.  His daughters actually seek him out to spend time with him now.  At night the youngest tells him \"I love you\" before he says it.  It used to be he would say it first and she would grunt and turn away from him.  \n\nWhile I am hopeful that my marriage can be saved I remain realistic.  The odds of him making a permanent change are against him.  For the first time in a very long time I feel like I am taking my life back.  I have set firm boundaries.

This made me livid. We live in a small town together, he knows what my career is and where I work. You can't tell me he didn't put 2 and 2 together, and do this on purpose. When I called and confronted him about it (which was a mistake, because I can't argue with someone who thinks they're right all the time, or get the truth out of someone who is angry about the fact that I know what he is) he of course lied to me, gave me indirect answers, or no answers at all. What was interesting though is that he kept telling me, \"I haven't heard from you in two months, I haven't heard from you in two months\" like he was hurt by it. Then cleared himself from any vulnerability and desire for me by telling me he had to block my number, because I was texting him mean things. I had texted him some very hurtful and attacking things, but it was only because I discovered what he was and what he had been doing to me, and I wanted him to know that I knew. Yes, I initiated \"no contact\" when I discovered he was hoovering me for the third time after he broke up with a girl he had left me for in the first place. I had to to protect myself. I wasn't going to let him use me like that again. I think it made him royally angry, and that's why he's dating this new girl at my work.\n\nAnyway, I'm starting to notice some triangulation going on here. Being a former partner of this NARC, I thought I was done with him. He shows up constantly at my work. I had to move offices to prepare for this, because I knew he would. He shows up to hang out with her, bring her flowers, or even drop her off and pick her up from work. He did all of this for me when we were dating, but didn't make such a show of it like he's doing now. I thought for the longest time that this new girlfriend had no idea about our history together. Then, she weirdly got personal (probably because this new boyfriend of hers won't listen or demeans what she has to say, so she's become lonely) confided to my boss that she knew. That he told her I was still incredibly broken up about it, and still wanted him. It's so obvious that he's projecting that image onto me to create a jealousy triangulation dynamic. Thank god my boss knows my side of the issue, because she told this new girl/coworker that I was absolutely done. \n\nAnyway, I fear that this triangulation he's trying to pull is not working exactly in his favor. So far, I have pretended like I have no idea this new coworker is dating my Narc. I have helped her out with work issues, shown her the ropes of the place, and been genuinely friendly. After all, it's not her I have a problem with. She's seemed to notice this too. Not only did she confide in my boss about how much she actually likes me, she mentioned in front of my entire fellow staff at a meeting that I've been very helpful to her at this new job, that I've taught her a lot, that I know what I'm doing, and that she appreciates and likes me. I can't imagine she's doing this for personal gain. Sometimes I think she might've gone home to my Narc, told him this, and that's when he finally admitted to her that we dated. He was so shady and manipulative when we were together that I can't imagine him offering up this information until he absolutely had too, and even then he couldn't make it out to be as bad as it was, because it would make himself look bad. \n\nSince this triangulation doesn't seem to be working in his favor (I imagine he wanted to make her jealous of me, and hate me as much as he does), should I be prepared for smearing in the future? Since I have not reacted negatively to him showing up at my work when it's unnecessary for him to be there, him showing up to volunteer at work events, or even friending my other coworkers on Facebook, I fear that his button pushing is going to get meaner/nastier. He's already been in my office without me there. He's going to events that are closely related to my department, and not his new girlfriend's. I'm fearful of his next move, because it's obvious to me that even though I have not been reacting negatively to any of this it's making him more powerful and brave with his actions. I imagine he thinks he can push the envelope eventually. \n\nHas anyone had similar experiences like this? I know there's not much I can do aside from continuing to ignore him, but it seems like he's not going to let up. I guess what I might be looking for at this point are some ideas as to what his next move will be. I want to be prepared. \n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My fianc\u00e9es ex has not only done a lot to him during the relationship, but also tried to come at him  legally since their breakup &amp; in the past has tried to make herself known in our lives.  She has stayed out of our way for a while now though.  It has had such an impact on our lives, but we have gotten through it and have a great life now.  What she put him &amp; us through is why I feel so smug about this.\n\nWe have both been no contact with her, have her blocked on social media accounts and everything.  But I happen to know her current landlord  who has told me she is several months behind on rent, they have gone to court &amp; she has another week to pay all the money (~$5,000) or an eviction order will be entered.  He his so unbelievably pissed at her.  Says \u201cshe is full of broken broken promises and excuses\u201d.  Hmmm, I seem to have heard that about her before.  After  hearing that, I did some quick research and found in the past two years she has been summoned to court 3 times from 3 different landlords and was evicted once.  And now likely to be evicted a second time.  I unblocked for a minute on Facebook because curiosity always kills the cat (shame on me).  Last year when she was going through the eviction proceedings she was posting all the expensive things she\u2019s doing like  getting her hair done, extensions and all.  This year I see she is doing the same thing, buying furniture and expensive groceries (who posts about their expensive groceries on Facebook?  Weird).  She doesn\u2019t have a lot of pictures recently, but last year when she was going through eviction she looked like a completely different person.  Looked miserable (but her hair was great lol), but incessantly posted a new pic every couple of days.  \n\nI can\u2019t even imagine doing that!!  Just not paying rent like that.  And the stress of moving &amp; not knowing where I will live next.  I would feel like a crappy person not paying rent as well.  Plus two court proceedings in front of the same judge in a year?  She isn\u2019t the kind of person to admit doing anything wrong, but how does she not feel shame about this situation?  I am the most chill person, but the thought of going through that gives me anxiety.  And he says she gets worked up so easily.  What makes this more satisfying for us is he supported her for years but she would tell everyone she carried the bulk of the bills &amp; insisted to him that she would be better financially without him and he wouldn\u2019t get better than her when he wouldn\u2019t go back.  I\u2019m sure there is so much more going on in her life than we will ever know.  Seeing this though gives me a glimpse and some satisfaction about what we went through.  I feel guilty at times about feeling good about it because her life &amp; brain at the moment are so unfortunate, so there is a mixture of feelings.  But apparently she is still spending and showing off so hasn\u2019t learned a lesson.  It seems she will hit a rock bottom if she keeps on this track.  Not a very functional narcissist I\u2019d say.

She takes every little inconvenience as a personal attack on her. She goes on about how she \"does a lot\" for us (which is true), but \"gets nothing in return\". She can lash out at us and I think her emotional outbursts contributed to the deep insecurities that I'm trying to conquer. She's intrusive, checking my school email (I'm a college freshman) and making my brother &amp; I use this Life360 app so she can track where we are (it's \"for our safety\").

I was not allowed to show an iota of negative emotion -- none.  He would rage at me if he perceived I was having a bad day or was stressed out at things in my life that had little to do with him.  After a few months, it felt like there was no room to have *any* emotions independently of *his*.  We went from (too-quickly) fantasizing about starting a family, to my slow awareness that this man would be a terrible father, and I could never consider having kids with someone who had anger issues.  Typically, one of his most-used degradations was saying \\***I**\\* was the angry one and would make a horrible mother.  I now know he was projecting, but this was just the beginning of the abuse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would sit through hours of long diatribes and endless discussions about HIM.  He would repeat stories over and over again.  He was also supremely paranoid -- has anyone else's ex been bizarrely paranoid?  He thought people were hacking his phone / tapping his line and stealing his ideas.  He's just some dude -- who would give a shit about his icloud or texts?  Somehow I rationalized this enough to ignore it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel so much shame for letting it go on after waking up and realizing what was going on.  My close friends, therapist, etc. pointed out that this man was verbally abusing me.  I had nothing but goodwill toward him, but he would continually find a way to make me at fault for some perceived slight, calling me selfish, claimed I didn't care about him.  The cycle of abuse started shortening as time went on, and pretty soon I spent more time being miserable with him than being happy.  Of course, at the end, he would blame my dissatisfaction with being around his moods on ME -- that it was my fault that I suddenly had nothing to say (because I didn't want to argue), or no longer had joy or levity doing the things we used to do before his mask totally slipped off.  Enumerated list of shit this guy did -- can anyone relate?:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Wanted to get me pregnant.  Quickly.  Then, when he later got angry, told me he hoped I'd get an abortion if I did get pregnant\n2. Sleep deprivation -- woke me up at all hours of the night to have sex\n3. Told me all the details of his past relationships with women -- he was NEVER at fault for the breakup.  He even told me their breast sizes, sexual kinks, how good they were in bed (I have no idea why I put up with this)\n4. Had one ex that he completely idealized -- it was the \"perfect relationship,\" but he admitted it was totally shallow, and I later found out she was 18 and he was 26 when they met (...)\n5. Rage attacks that got worse and worse -- he would throw things across the room, slam doors. One time he took my glasses off my face and threw them.\n6. OBSESSION with social media. He was obsessed with his image on Instagram and was constantly checking it/posting stories/looking for likes.  He would check his account at 3 or 4 in the morning to see if he got likes.  Would never admit his obsession\n7. His closest guy friends were tough.  I mean, like dudes you didn't want to fuck with and probably had a criminal history.\n8. Didn't seem to have any other close friends outside of casual acquaintances that he called his \"friends.\"  He mostly knew them through online music communities\n9. Seemed shy, softspoken (LOL) and introverted when I initially met him -- at first, this was endearing\n10. Very, very smart. Maybe photographic memory.\n11. Highly manipulative\n12. Could not hold down a job, had no money, had a history of women who took care of him financially\n13. Close relationship with this mother, which always baffled me.  I wondered if he would ever speak to his mother the way he spoke to me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo after a few breakups, getting back together, etc (he actually didn't hoover too much, I'm ashamed to admit.  I made it too easy for him because I missed him), this week I've prayed for strength.  I wrote him a long text (that he doesn't even deserve), thanking him for the time we spent together, showing him good will, wishing him the best -- kind, loving words because that is who I am.  I sought closure (even though I know it comes from within, ultimately).   His response?  One line.  \"Take care.\"  And that was the last, most painful stab in the heart that I'm willing to put myself through.  I blocked him on every platform and my phone.  His final cruelty was enough to finally say, \"enough.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow,  the fear that he will replace me right away.  That he's out there already luring someone else in.  Nights are especially hard... thinking he might be out with someone else, having sex with someone else, not missing me.  Ugh.  Why is this so hard?

I hated having to abide by rules set down my adults and I craved the freedom that came with whatever arbitrary coming-of-age number you subscribe to. Whether it's 17 for getting a car, 18 to drink, or 21 to graduate uni and be your own person. Whatever.\n\nI hit middle school in 2004, when teachers were finally realising they needed to be tech-savvy. Monitors were still about a foot thick, XP was our operating system and MSN messenger was the favoured way of flirting with your crush. We had numerous IT lessons about staying safe online, the dangers of chatrooms and keeping passwords hidden.\n\nI'd always been a bit lonely, I guess. I fitted in just enough to not get noticed. I had friends, but they did think I was a bit odd. I was smart, and a good kid, from a good family. The idea of getting in trouble at school brought me out in a cold sweat.\n\nAt 9 I was the weird kid who didn't quite have the social skills to keep up with her peers. I was regularly kicked the crap out of at school for being different. I developed early, and both boys and girls mocked me for wearing bras. I combated this with an adult aloofness, an arrogance, which, ironically, got me kicked down a whole lot more than if I had just conformed. I retreated to the library and lost myself in the countless pages of a hundred books.\n\nBy the time I hit 10 I was reasonably good with our computer. My parents left the house early to work. I had the house to myself for about an hour and a half. I did what any 10-year-old in the mid-noughties would do - I broke out The Sims 2 and created my own little world where I was in charge.\n\nI craved control in a world where rules dominated; uniform, food, bedtime, clothes, computer time - you name it, there was a rule.\n\nAs an adult now, I can completely appreciate why these existed, but then? I wanted to rebel.\n\nLike every kid, the second you're told \"don't do that, it's dangerous\", you want to do it - right? I was too scared to get myself involved in anything that would actually cause trouble, so I chose possibly the easiest way to get my fix of pre-teen rebellion.\n\nI found chatrooms.\n\nUn-moderated and with complete anonymity, I wanted to make some friends. It started innocently, but the number of people on there using it to do indecent things... I'll be honest, I was fascinated. it felt like I'd finally been allowed access to this secret grown-up world, and I loved how I was treated. The people I met seemed to genuinely care what I thought. It was like a shot of heroin to a child with absolutely no self-esteem or real friendship group.\n\nThe descent into the world of paedophiles was surprisingly swift. I learnt how to make people happy. I learnt how to hook up the webcam, take grainy pictures of myself, send them and erase them from the hard-drive.\n\nI knew I'd get in trouble for what I was doing, but I honestly didn't care, because I felt wanted. We had lessons at school about paedophiles, but the images we were given were of creepy old men - clearly nothing like the smooth, sophisticated people talking to me, who cared.\n\nI was a child. I was manipulated.\n\nAnd for a long time, I believed I consented.\n\nIt's entirely reasonable to believe there are photos and videos of me floating around somewhere. Between 10 and 11, I must have sent dozens, if not hundreds of pictures.\n\nAnd then I met a guy online who lived near me. He was nice, charming, gentle, he cared about my childish worries and fears. He seemed to just get it, where the other adults in my life felt alien and dismissive. He felt like he could protect me against everything bothering me, everyone who hurt me at school.\n\nHe wanted to meet. Tiny alarm bells started going off in my head, but I ignored them.\n\nI met him, and we went back to his to play board games. Nothing happened.\n\nThe next time we met, a few weeks later, he kissed me, and he touched me. I never once said no. I believed, at the time, I was capable of consent. The first time we had sex, it didn't feel like how the teachers described rape and assault. It looked nothing like the abuse videos we'd seen about how you should never meet strangers.\n\nThe first few times it felt good. Maybe a little painful at first, but good.\n\nAfter that, he got rougher. It hurt a lot, but I wanted to make him happy. He told me to call him daddy.\n\n*Be daddy's whore*, he'd say. *Bend over, whore.*\n\n*Yes daddy*, I'd reply. It made me feel so sick, so dirty. I hated every second.\n\nHe used my terror of getting in trouble against me. He'd threaten to tell my parents what a dirty little whore I'd been, that they'd hate me forever.\n\nI believed them - until one day, something snapped. He used his threats. He said he'd tell everyone what I'd done.\n\nI have no idea where this came from, but I responded with \"go on then.\"\n\nHe never contacted me again.\n\nFor years and years, I didn't believe I'd been abused, manpulated and hurt. I believed I deserved how much it hurt because I'd consented.\n\nJesus Christ, I was 11 years old.\n\nTo this day I struggle with saying no sometimes. I'm a people-pleaser. I want to make people proud of me. I'm still terrified of getting in trouble.\n\nYes, I made some stupid decisions. Sending pictures of myself, meeting a stranger when all the trustworthy adults in my life had told me, repeatedly, that it was an incredibly dangerous thing to do? Really, seriously stupid, and I curse myself on a semi-regular basis for causing myself so much damage.\n\nUltimately, I didn't cause what happened to me. I was abused, I was raped. I was manipulated into doing things no child should ever be exposed to. For a long time, I had an incredibly unhealthy view of sex and relationships, and I have nightmares. The idea of being called *whore*, or saying *daddy* during sex makes my skin crawl.\n\nI guess I've finally come to terms with the idea that it wasn't my fault.\n\nI didn't consent because I didn't have the capacity. Consent isn't necessarily saying yes, or not saying no - consent means you understand, fully, the consequences of what is happening.\n\nLegally and ethically, no child can consent to sex.\n\nI am slowly learning to forgive myself.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I can't escape the bastard because I had kids with him years ago. Any kind of contact I have with him is a trigger. I'm not even kidding, every single time I even get a text I get dizzy, tunnel vision, chest pains, upset stomach, difficulty breathing, thoughts spin out of control, and I go into full panic mode and it will last for the remainder of the day. It happens instantly and I don't know how to manage it at all. These panic attacks have taken over my fucking life.\n\nMy ex insists that he is in contact with me on a damn near daily basis. It doesn't matter what I do or say to him for him to stop, he simply refuses listen. He will text first thing in the morning, while I'm at work, at the end of the day, he doesn't give a fuck. He demands that we \"co-parent\" regardless how I am affected by the constant contact. I honestly can't do it guys. He enjoys his ability to control me still and is obviously still emotionally abusing me 8 FUCKING YEARS LATER. We went to a mediator recently where he told her I am a narcissistic mother and it's just what he has to deal with. He read the report for the first time yesterday and proceeded to call me a narcissistic liar first thing this morning so I know that I will continuously be called that by him now. He also loves to constantly throw in \"well we will just have to talk to the judge about it now, wont we?\"\n\nI know that the only way I will be able to manage these emotions is by blocking his number completely, but I can't do that yet. I was able to manage my damn symptoms/triggers for years but now its completely unmanageable. My PTSD is back and it's worse than I remember the first time. The first time around I mainly reacted with depressive episodes, but this is full blown anxiety/panic attacks that lasts until I can sleep. Well, I can't sleep. I can't do my job. I can't find energy to clean my house. All I want to do is stay home all day. I've gained SO MUCH fucking weight. I'm in contact with a local domestic violence organization and have asked for their help in advocating for me in court (I do have a lawyer already) and I am on a wait-list for counseling.\n\nDoes anyone have any tips for me on how to navigate these symptoms and feelings? I feel like I am honestly going crazy.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm not one of those women who will ever chase a man, so him not hoovering will mean it's completely over. For the best, I know, but still, I hurt.\n\nAnyway, the transformation in my life is astounding to me. After a little less than two years \"dating\" him, and the slow fade, ghosting and apparent discard. I used to feel 17, I'm in my late 40's. I walk out now all buttoned up and the world now treats me differently. I have transformed into a \"spinster.\" After a difficult marriage and many years raising my kids with no dating life, I was so energized to go out and meet someone. Enter *****. I looked so beautiful that night.\n\nI am no longer the same woman. I am now treated like one if those aging neighbors wherever I go.
