One thing that I have very happy nostalgic memories of is this soup that my mom always makes on Halloween. I decided to make the soup myself this year, as I no longer live with my mom or sister because of how toxic they often are. \n\nI had big pots of hot, delicious soup on the stove (I made extra so we would have lots of leftovers to eat) and the autumn sun was coming through the window in the kitchen, a strong wind was blowing crispy gold and red leaves all through the yard, my fianc\u00e9 was playing with our puppy on the floor with Nightmares Before Christmas playing on the TV behind them. I was feeling... happy. Content. Looking forward to nostalgic Halloween soup. I decided to post a photo of the big pot of soup on Facebook, with a short little explanation of how my mom makes the soup every Halloween and how I\u2019m carrying on the tradition.\n\nI had just sat down and had been savoring the first couple bites of my soup when my phone went off. A text from my sister that took all the wind out of my sails entirely. \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just post some BS like this for Facebook to see as if you care about family and then not make efforts to see or even talk to us. Don\u2019t act like you care about us to your friends, but not to us.\u201d \n\nIt felt like a sucker punch to the gut. I lost my appetite, put my soup into a Tupperware. I wanted to cry. I still want to cry, I feel like all my happy autumn Halloween feelings have been ripped away from me and turned to these feelings of worthlessness and guilt, and sadness. \n\nMy mom and sister are extremely conservative and religious people who view me as a \u2018black sheep\u2019 because i disagree with most of their views. Things were really horrible for a while... moving away from them helped and I\u2019ve been trying to rebuild a better relationship with them while maintaining boundaries. That means I\u2019m not in constant contact with them and I do mostly keep my distance, because a big issue I\u2019ve had with them is that they have no respect for my time and personal space. They constantly harass me for not talking to them enough, not visiting enough, and for turning down invitations to things when they only give me a few hours notice. They call me selfish and say I\u2019m turning my back on my family. I love them but I need to be my own person... they just want me to be what THEY want. Everything and anything else is essentially damnation to hell. \n\nIs this event an example of emotional abuse, or just a person being shitty? Because I feel.... miserable. My head is spinning with negative self-talk and I can\u2019t figure out if this is an abusive situation or just my sister being rude. Or... if she\u2019s right and I\u2019m being fake on Facebook by posting about carrying on my family\u2019s tradition of Halloween soup.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I'm new so I hope whatever I end up posting is okay. Might be rambling and long.\n\nSome background: I'm a stay at home mom but also have a job I do while my toddler sleeps, to put perspective everything I have to think about in a day. \n\nI'm never good enough for my husband. Things have been going pretty okay lately, or so I thought. \n\nI don't even know what specific supposed failure of mine started this latest incident. \n\nSo here's what happened in the last couple days. He expects me to be his personal secretary. He'll text me things I'm supposed to write on a physical note and put on his desk, rather than just going back and looking at his texts or making a note in his phone like a normal fucking person. He called me and asked me if I had made a note for him yet. Our child and I had just walked in the door from an activity so I said I hadn't. He said he sent it noon, why hadn't I done it yet. There have been a few times where I forgot to make the notes so felt the need to check up on me and make sure I was obeying him. \n\nThat night he chastised me for staying up too late, going so far as to come make sure I was asleep. I wasn't, so I got an earful for \"disobeying\" him for that. \n\nIn the morning he complained about the way the sheets smell. I have been doing the laundry the same way forever, but it was my fault he couldn't sleep from the smell. The \"smell\" simply being a clean scent from the laundry detergent he's never complained about before. He then complained about my hairspray, and yelled at me for for not leaving the door shut.\n\nI had to take our child to another activity so before I left I sent him a message that said \"seems like all you do complain about what I do and how I do things\"\n\nHe sent a novel of nasty things in return. I'm just going to copy/paste our conversation because I'm afraid paraphrasing won't do his insanity justice. \n\n\n&gt;Yep and I have a right to. You've ruined our lives, and I'll pick up the pace and try to help get us out of this hole which is going to in all likelihood bury our entire family\n\n\nI'm not sure what \"hole\" he's talking about here. We have no debt or anything. \n\n\n&gt;And now you need to pick up the pace\n\n\n&gt;By listening and following directions\n\n\n&gt;I am so fucking tired of asking you to do things and having to remind you seven times. You're so disrespectful and you have no respect for the head of our family\n\n\nAgain, I have no idea what he means by this. I forget things sometimes, absolutely, but I'm only human. \n\n&gt;Which means you have no respect for yourself or for [child's name] or for the children that we may have in the future\n\n\nAs if I'd willingly have any more children with him.\n\n\nI said: \"Did you read what you sent me? I ruined our lives? What? Seriously, do you think these are okay things to say to someone? You can't take them back.\"\n\n\n&gt;Blah blah blah blah blah. I am so tired of being gas-lit and nags by you when you don't listen to fucking anyting, you have the maturity of a 10 year old brat and I'm fucking tired of it\n\n\n&gt;I've done nothing wrong and you are a fucking liar who has fucked up so relentlessly and repeatedly\n\n\n&gt;Now piss off I told you not to message me but you disobeyed me again because youre fucking stupid\n\n\nHe keeps calling me a liar but I don't know what I'm supposedly lying about. \n\n\nI finally just agreed with him that I'm a piece of shit.\n\n\nSeveral hours later he half apologized, said I wasn't a piece of shit. \n\n\n&gt;You really need to take ownership of yourself and start treating me with more respect by listening to what I say\n\n\n&gt;I love you very much and I love our family tremendously and sure spend the night at your mom's. I'm very proud of all that we've accomplished, and I just ask that you make a bulletproof and bombproof system so that when I ask you to do something it gets done so that I don't have to babysit you\n\n\nI don't know what specific things I'm not doing that he needs to \"babysit\" me for.\n\n\nI simply said, \"The things you've said are honestly unforgivable.\"\n\n\nIn the morning he sent\n\n\n&gt;What do you expect?\n\n\n&gt;I've given you a million chances and you're honestly very lazy and you need to go live in your mom's basement where she will take care of you and put up with your laziness\n\n\nI guess I'm lazy now too. Since I didn't beg for forgiveness at his feet this time, he just doubled down. If I'm so terrible, why does he want to be with me? I'm not even sure what I did to get this type of reaction, other than super vague accusations of not obeying and needing to write to do lists for seemingly specific tasks that he has not stated. \n\n\nOf course it's okay for him to forget things or not do things I ask. His favorite excuse is that he's \"tired.\" If I say the same then it's just an excuse and I need to do better. \n\n\nThis guy has destroyed me and my self esteem. I never feel like doing anything fun anymore, I'm just numb to everything. \n\n\nHe is going to be home in a few hours and I have no idea what to do. I feel so sick.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Can you all tell me if these are the signs of toxic relationship or narcissistic behaviour. It all started with Love Bombing then suddenly a marriage proposal after 4 months of a relationship. Things have been moving quite fast. I\u2019ll put down couple of points: a) She wants me to stay connected 24/7. And if I delay in replying or calling back while I\u2019m stuck at work she starts fighting. Initially I used to explain things to her but this behaviour never stopped. I started feeling fearful if get stuck and unable to reply that I\u2019ll have to face the fight again. She use to say stuffs like If you don\u2019t want to talk then tell me you don\u2019t want to talk. For this reason I started telling her in advance that I\u2019m gonna get stuck for a while. But this has started giving me anxiety. b) Once I was in my office party she started calling and saying I\u2019ll hop into the cab and come there. Whom you are with? I was constantly texting her and telling her my whereabouts. I just went to dance with my colleagues for while and couldn\u2019t text. I got so pissed off with this behaviour that I too shouted at her. I started feeling suffocated. She once said I lowered my standards by being with you. I got really hurt on this because I don\u2019t expect to hear something like that from her. With all of this behaviour I too started fighting with her often. I started loosing affection for her. She used to say something or the other and then become fine after a while saying lovy dovy things and cuddling but these fights and used to affect me a lot. And I was unable to reciprocate in the way I used to before. I have become unsure about her now. I\u2019m confused weather all of this behaviour is out of love or I\u2019m actually dealing with a toxic person. These is been asking for marriage thing for the past one year. I\u2019m confused to ahead with the same. Offcourse apart from above we have shared beautiful moments as well which we both have cherished. But because of above  I have actually become negative towards her. Is it fine to say yes to marriage. I\u2019m confused.

I've been so stressed and now relieved that they are over. Halloween was yesterday for me and since I couldn't go out for trick-or-treating my mum brought me some candy from work.\n\nI went downstairs to put away a cup and bowl I was using and decided to grab myself ONE piece of candy (my dad was home) and walk upstairs into my room, I was only about halfway up the stairs when my dad called to me and asked me what I had, I told him I had some candy and he told me to put it back, at this point I had already put it in my mouth so I told him id put it in the bin, after much back and forth I told him again id throw it out, he called me a f\\*cking idiot and I just sat in my room, throwing the candy in my bin.\n\nIt only occurred to me after watching  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQV5xh5gGhE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQV5xh5gGhE) that I might have an abusive father. The story I've just told you happened around an hour ago but there's a lot more to it. I don't really know where to start so I'll do bits that I remember.\n\nI think I was around 7 or 8 when this happened but all I remember was getting held down, my dad putting his hand on my mouth and suffocating me, till I was clawing at his hands trying to pry them off, the rest of that memory is just crying.\n\nAnother time we were fighting over SOMETHING (I was probably 10 at the time), and he pushed me really hard against the door, the doorknob hitting my back incredibly hard. It hurt a lot.\n\nIf I did something REALLY BAD, like stay up over my bedtime, he'd kick me out and make me sit at the front door of my house for however long he thought was right. Often times id be holding onto the railing of the stairs only to slip off and be dragged on the carpet outside. \n\nI have a distinct memory of one of these nights, I don't remember what I had done but he dragged me outside and locked me out there. I had a toothbrush and my pink pyjamas on, I was maybe 10 or something. He had kicked me out and I was standing there crying, (My family lives in an apartment) eventually 2 of my neighbours had come out and comforted me, I don't think they could make out anything because I was a sobbing mess. After a while, my dad opened the door and pulled me in. I ran upstairs and went to the bathroom, locking the door. I heard my dad run up the stairs and then began kicking down the door until it opened. I just sat there crying before he started yelling at me.\n\nOne of the things he does normally is when I'm doing something outside of my room, he'll come up to me with a smile on his face and try and hit me, ill tell him to stop but he'll keep going till I've run away from him or he's satisfied.\n\nThis is one of the reasons I have low self-esteem and confidence, he would always try and put me down with words like, 'your pathetic' or 'fucking idiot'. And the insults would always get worse if my parents were fighting. They were fighting one night, I don't know what I did, but he just called me a bitch and walked out.\n\nI'm also a very soft-spoken person, so if I find myself mumbling and don't speak up he'll insult me some more.\n\nIt doesn't help that he's an avid drinker, drinking 1-4 drinks a night. I don't feel comfortable around him, I feel like he's a ticking time bomb and if I say or do something wrong he'll threaten me or worse.\n\nIf you're wondering, yes my mum does step in, but only sometimes, when I'm clearly not having it.\n\nSorry that this isn't formated or anything, and sorry I don't remember much, I have a bad memory.

{"post_id": "dq3cx9", "created_utc": 1572610214, "title": "I feel like sex work is the only thing I'm good for", "author": "lfstasha", "self_text": "Hello, I'm not really used to posting things like these, especially about something that is so embarrassing to talk about, but I have never told somebody about this and I've never found somebody with the same issue, and I feel hopelessly alone about the whole issue. I guess I just need to talk.\n\nTo give a bit of backstory to how I have come to feel this way about myself and my future, I was sexually abused from ages 5 to 12 by a family friend. The sexual abuse was very violent and he would beat me very badly both during and outside of sex. He would constantly degrade me and call me a slut and a whore, and often referred to me as his own personal sex toy, and there was rarely a time in my childhood where I felt like a human being, I always just felt like an object who's feelings and opinions didn't, and would never matter. I had to be very careful and cautious about making mistakes as a kid because he would always find a way to hear about it, and would punish me for it. Every time I failed a test at school and he found out, he punished me by having rough sex with me, and would throw me to the floor afterwards, get me to look at him and then tell me that this is what I got for being stupid, and that I should do better next time if I didn't want a punishment like this. I also was not able to talk with any other guys, even when I was 9 years old having an innocent conversation with a boy my age, it didn't matter, he would always twist it to make me seem like a whore who couldn't keep her hands to herself and I would get what he called a 'punishment' for that, too. On two occasions, friends of his paid him to have sex with me when I was 11. This was the first time I had ever been called a prostitute by him or anybody else, and when I told him that I didn't want to be one, he just called me a pathetic bitch and told me to suck it up. He also took sexual pictures and videos of me a lot at that age too, and instructed me on what to do during them, and it was very important for me not to mess up on his instructions because if I did I would get hit across the face or worse. He told me that he was going to sell them, and said that everyone was going to know how much of a whore I am, and that my life was going to be ruined as a result. \n\nThe words still ring into my head all the time, mainly because I *do* believe my life was ruined. I am currently in high school and I feel like damaged goods, a used and fucked up person that will never amount to anything more than that. I'm at a point in my life where I need to seriously start thinking about what I want to do with my future, but the outcomes aren't looking great. I used to be ambitious but I feel like all of that has been sucked out of me. I know I have plenty of options but I feel like the only one I deserve and have the right to choose is a future in which I don't go to university, don't try to make a future of myself, and just sell my body for other people to use, because that's what has happened to me all of my life. My future feels totally hopeless and I might as well spend my adulthood doing the one thing that I know I'm good at and will always be good at; a worthless object that can just lay there and be used. Despite everything I have just said, I want to make it very clear that I have nothing against sex workers and I certainly do not look down on them, but I do look down on myself. Subjecting myself to sex work would be extremely triggering and damaging to my mental health, which I know makes the fact that I am considering going into it sound even more insane and illogical, but at the same time, I feel like it's the only chance at a future that I have. I feel like it's what I deserve for being such a horrible person. I feel like it's what I'm expected to do, after being labelled as a whore, a slut, a sexual object my whole life. I used to really want to go to university but now I really don't feel like I can, I can't imagine going to university, it would drive insane knowing that I'm there when I don't deserve to be there. I feel like being a prostitute is the only thing I will ever succeed at doing, the only thing I will ever be good for. I know that prostitution can be dangerous, but I feel like there isn't anything anyone can do to me that hasn't already been done. And if there is, I feel too much self-loathing to care. I feel like there's no way to escape my past and all of the shameful things I have done. I had to watch people pay to have sex with me. I was told to pose for pictures that were going to be sold. There's videos out there of me, having sex with my abuser, that are actually available for people to see and watch. How am I supposed to live a normal life knowing these things about myself? I just can't. I don't see any way out other than this and I feel so hopeless. I'm sorry that this entire post is just one big pity party, I feel like I haven't made sense this entire time. I just feel so tired. I'm not really seeing any other option other than throwing everything else away to do the sex work that I was born to do or just ending everything.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Drunk at 2:30am is not a good start to a serious conversation.\n\nThis morning, he was fuming about it. I kept asking the same question, trying to remain grey rock and staying calm and focused. He was shouting, I was not. He kept deflecting my question, and taking his argument through to unrelated places (\"you've done nothing to help with the redecorating!\" okay, what?) and I pointed out that he was deflecting. He called me mental, and honestly I've forgotten most of what he said because it was so irrelevant.\n\nI asked him again \"okay. But have you had sex with anyone else?\" he eventually said no, and stormed off.\n\nI totally get the anger about being woken up, but the rest of the behaviour seems wrong. To me, it seems like the reaction of a guilty person. \n\nWhat I'd expect from an innocent person being asked this, is some level of concern (Why would you think that? Are you okay?) and reassurance (I love you and I'm happy with you, I wouldn't betray you like that). Even through the anger, if it was the other way around, I'd want my partner to know they had no reason to worry.\n\nOf course I never expected a real answer, but I feel like now I have more concern than I did before.\n\nAm I being paranoid? Or would this be troubling to you too?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I ended up dating better people but now I've found this boy... grade A manipulative, controlling, narc. What's hard is idk if I'm (27f) the problem or if it's his (23m). I need to see a therapist again. I used to see one before but finances got tight when my cat got diagnosed with diabetes and I had to put another one down. \n\nI'm gonna make myself a list of what he's done so I don't forget, starting from the earliest signs. You can skip to the bottom cause it's a lot.\n\n1) When I told him I couldn't initially take one of his cats when he was moving he said: \"Well I hope she doesn't die.\" He threw her outside because she was loud and meowed a lot. I caved and took the cat anyway. She's the aforementioned cat I ended up having to out down because she had cysts lining her digestive tract that could not be removed and were causing her a great deal of pain. He acted sad when I told him the news but I dont think he cared as much as I did.\n\n2) I asked one day while out driving if we could stop by a thrift store (one of my hobbies) and that he didn't have to go in, that I'd be quick, maybe 15 mins. He said: \"I don't want to go there. I know the people that work there.\" I knew this was a lie because I later coaxed it out of him that he lied.\n\n3) When I told him I saw a therapist he said: \"Therapists don't actually help. Why don't you come to me with your problems? Therapists are just people you pay to be your friend.\" Bois get this. He told me like-- 2 weeks later that he wanted to go back to school for THERAPY. WHAT!? When I called him out on it he said: \"we already talked about this you don't gotta make me feel bad about it you know I'm sorry.\" \n\n4) He finally got a good, well paying job. He hates it lol. His boss is a liar and just the worst guy ever. My nbf smokes weed. He was told that he would have to take a drug test. I told him to that he should temporarily stop smoking so he could pass. He didn't. He kept smoking then when it was time for the test he was mad lol. He ended up getting fake piss from someone.\n\n5) We used to play video games together. (I'm an avid console and game collector. He and I actually met working at GameStop). We were in the middle of a duos match in Fortnite. He died immediately and rage quit. (He's one of THOSE gamers that if the game doesn't go the way he wants or if he loses, he throws a fit.) I was left to play solo. I ended up winning that game with 9 kills. I was so happy. I shared my excitement with him and he proclaimed: \"Not to sound insensitive, but I'm not happy you won that game by yourself and with so many kills.\" It made me feel so bad.\n\n6) Here's the biggest one. I am a recovering alcoholic. I've been clean for about 3 years now. I refuse to put myself in situations that will be tempting. We had plans to see one of his friends for his birthday. It was gonna be a party with drinking. I initially agreed cause I thought I could handle it. The closer the day came, the more I realized it was a bad idea. I messaged him and told him that I actually didn't wanna go, but he could go if he wanted. He lost it. He called me screaming and crying. He told me that I was WEAK for not being able to handle my own around alcohol. He told me that if he went alone, that he would get shitfaced because it's the only way he would have a good time. He told me that I ruined his whole weekend and that this was all my fault. I cried. Then told him we needed a break. He reluctantly agreed. \n\nFlash forward to today. We are back together because I'm probably stupid cause he said he'd get better. Granted he is getting better with his anger but idk. Small things keep happening. He told me that most of the clothes I wear are thotty. Wanna know what I was wearing that day? Black skinny jeans, blank ankle boots with MAYBE a 2 inch heel, and a red, short sleeve, flouncy shirt that he bought me. No belly was showing. Idk. I thought it was a cute and nice outfit. \n\nI told him he needs to see a therapist. After a bit of arguing he said he'd set up an appointment in a couple of weeks. I dont wanna wait a couple of weeks I want him to go now! Lol! I set my foot down because he initially tried to fight me on it. I told him that he either saw a doctor or I'm leaving. But tbh idk if I should just leave anyway. He has made me feel like complete shit. \n\nI can't afford a therapist anymore. I work part time from home and I average maybe $1000/ month. Most of that goes to my car note, insurance, storage unit, phone bill, and my diabetic cats insulin. I know I need to go back but all help sites for affordable counseling are either not accepting new applicants or they cant fit me in cause I dont have insurance. I'm stuck and scared. I feel like I want to leave but idk if I'm just being overly dramatic. I'm an emotional woman, I know this. I've been working on it a lot. I strive to be better every day but idk. I'm scared. I'm depressed. I don't eat much. I'm barely 100 pounds now. My trichotillomania is worst than ever. I have very negative thoughts. I don't get dolled up as much as I used to anymore.

So I went through my texts because I couldn\u2019t remember what date we had separated and people keep asking how long it\u2019s been. WTF. I couldn\u2019t stop reading. I was saying things about a month ago that I didn\u2019t remember at all until I read it. Like asking him why he\u2019d done things that were more than just emotionally abusive and then acted like it hadn\u2019t happened. And even when I read these things it was like I knew it had happened but couldn\u2019t access the memory unless I focused really hard.

He was spending his days making one crazy problem after another and asking me to handle everything. Stuck in the past? I literally was blanking my life out in order to cope and attempt to remain present and happy. \nManipulative? Twisting everything around on him? Literally... he was just accusing me of what he was doing to shift the focus to me. I see that now. \nControlling? I was trying to get him to stop ruining mine and the kids lives and be kind to us.\nCrazy and cold? I mean, I need therapy but I think almost 11 years of extreme stress tends to do that to you. \nJealous? All I did was ask him if the reason he was disappearing for many hours every day was because he was cheating and left it at that. \nI didn\u2019t believe in him? He literally made one grandiose promise after another and did not do any of it. While I waited around for these things to happen and tried to make our lives better myself. If I didn\u2019t believe in him I wouldn\u2019t have been there so long.\nA terrible parent? Obviously I\u2019ve made mistakes, but I do my best to protect my kids, love them, teach them and provide for them. \n\nI could go on. I don\u2019t know how exactly I started to internalize what he was telling me about myself. I mean, I knew a lot of it wasn\u2019t true, and had already been working on healing for a while once I realized it might be gaslighting... but doesn\u2019t hurt to look back and see that I wasn\u2019t doing this stuff. \n\nI wish I hadn\u2019t let these things get under my skin and keep me from standing up for myself. This list isn\u2019t meant as a self defense as much as a reminder to myself and all of you that it\u2019s NOT YOU.

It just can\u2019t be. \n\nIf you are in a similar situation, please don\u2019t stick around because you think you are somewhat to blame and nobody will believe you. \n\nYesterday was the first holiday ever that wasn\u2019t spent walking on eggshells. The kids actually had fun. I can\u2019t even explain how different that is but you probably get it. \nAnyways, working on healing one day at a time. One day I\u2019m happy, the next I\u2019m numb, or anxious for no reason. But all I can say is, I have no doubt now that the right thing to do was get out. And the brain fog is improving. Still miss companionship, but I\u2019d rather be alone forever than continue to lose myself.\n\nI hope we can all find a way to heal, love and trust again.

So if there's someone who will go through my account and past activity, don't base that with me. 2) I'm above  casual 22 y/o guy who has a job, plays videogames, just to skip the free time (but later realized, it was also a way for me to escape from harsh reality; escapism, you can say. You'll know soon why...). 3) This will be a long story; you've been warned. 4) English is my 2nd language, so sorry for any errors and mistakes.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI want to start by saying, my family is a complete clusterfuck. \n\nFrom the stories I learned from my older brother, mom, grandma and me, when for the first time was able to see, there was always yelling, cursing, pathology, manipulation and \"matter of pride/honor\" in my family. Including mostly my father.\n\nMy father was raised by a respected farmer, who went downhill and became abusive alcoholic and woman, who's \"mohair\" (For polish slang \"Moher\"), who spreads rumors about us, herself, everyone, belives God forgives her, forces everyone around to pray, blah blah blah. He also has siblings: sister (34), brother (47) and another brother (28 \u2020 ). All of them were abused such as my dad, but they had opportunity to abandon the house they lived in childhood. But not my dad....My dad is your typical \"I promise I won't do this again\" or \"I will change\" type. He never does. Before 2004 (when Poland joined EU), me and brother were beaten with a belt for things we did or didn't do on purpose (I was beaten as 8-9  for \"standing in shade on a 2.5-hour appeal in Sunny day 32\\*C\". He apologized, like 2 weeks later). Verbal, emotional and mental abuse such as \"you're worthless, you're shit. Shut your mouth, you whore\" \"you whored yourself among my friends\" or \"you're a pussy\" were common. Using force on us was used only, when we pissed him off really hard like at the time we hide from him as kids. He's also a alcohol addict. Whenever you go: garage, chicken house, basement, glasshouse or in kitchen: 5 to 10 bottles of beer. At the end of 2 months, you could count 300+ bottles of this junk, in total. (that's 315 $, 1200pln)\n\n(just so you know, this kind of behavior happened from '96 to present)\n\nI can add also, he's a critic, arrogant, coward, egoistic and hurtful piece of trash (for example: when I confessed to my parents, that a girl I had a crush at HS rejected me \\[didn't made a big deal out of it, still being her friend today\\], damn bastard used that against me the next bloody \"Drunk Night\" of his). The most important thing is: he never asks for help. If it's cleaning the garage, cut the tree for fireplace or help him carry things: he will never ask for help. He will either deny it, theorize that mom forced me/us to go help him (which is a total bullshit: we see you're in need, we come help, dumbass, that's what REAL FAMILY does, but not him for how long? 20 years now? longer?) The death of the youngest sibling (28) struck my father the hardest and further into alcoholism.\n\nHe was never into idea of going to the therapist, justyfing himself that \"I will not talk with someone, who will listen to my private problems, my life and tell me what to do\" or \"I'm not willing to express my feelings with a vulture like these damn psychologists/therapists\"....he either was too proud to go to them or too stupid, because he thought they will write a  biography about him and sell his stories. lol\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat really pains me and pains my brother, mother and sister, because of his acting like a mental (and abused) alcoholic  father, things like these happened:\n\n\\&gt;My uncle and aunt (Dad's brother and sis) doesn't want to stay in contact with our family. They're fine with us, but not, when HE (dad) is around. TL;DR: My dad (when drunk) did something to my uncle, uncle in return, did something embaressing towards dad in Belgium, that caused my dad to loose job. The aunt - only visits us or grandma, but stays the hell away from my dad and grandpa.\n\n\\&gt;My brother is a charismatic, anger exploding, high earning guy. I envy his charisma and expressing emotions, so much. He went through alot, but to this day, holds a huuuge grudge towards father and grandfather, for things these bastards did to him and us. He was the direct witness of how my drunk grandfather punched my mom with my &gt;1 y/o sister in her hands. My bro was a angel of vengeance right there, punched that bastard directly in left skull temple.\n\n\\&gt;My mom, who is a strong-will person and neither lets herself to be a doll, fights for what is right. She also let loose to bitchslapped the bastard. But recently, she's stressed out to the point, she had stiffed face, twice in this 3 month abscence. She's 100% sure , she doesn't want to live this life anymore and wants to divorce. As she put it \"3 times the charm...and you ruined it (refering to my father)\"\n\n\\&gt;My sister ( now 8) is a cheerful young girl, but same as my brother, starts developing outbursts of anger and crying. She's more scared of \"what if my friends find out\" that worried about her own life. \n\n\\&gt;Me: a 22 y/o guy, who's in depression, escapism, outbursts of crying, doubt and has to \"wear a mask\". Because of these mental abusements, I tried to distance myself from people, keep it all into myself (the only people I opened myself to were my childhood psychologist and HS friend), never tried to fell in love and tried my hardest to contaminate this disease my father spills at us....because of all of this stress, something finally snapped and lost consciousness in HS one day ( shame it was senior year).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese days now (you can say even years), we mostly ignore him, interrupt him by bursting in, telling him to shut up with his complete nonsense. Since HS, I'm recording his drunk \"threatenings\", my brother and mom also store the evidence against him, and month ago I heard those words \"Stop it or I'll file a divorce\". These weeks also were rocky since - you guessed - he didn't took that pretty well. I'm revealing this situation here, at this reddit, since I was advised to: I attended to Al-anon group for 1,5 month now, my childhood psychologist (still has contact with her; amazing woman :)  ) told me to \"express my feelings in any form; diary, letter, post on forum\" and I honestly have nowhere else to ask for more advice than the people who went through the same stuff.\n\nI'll give a update if things will go smoothly (which won't) and change of plans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you readed it all, with either relatable situation in your life or shock expression on your face, thank you for sticking around. And before I will find \"haha, weak, male is crying\" comments - well, yeah. I did and do sometimes: I feel alone with all of this, despite the same issue and us bonding as far as possible from my father, I still feel so lonely.\n\nthe polish phrase \"only on photographs would your kin look nice\" is accurate here", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Care to share stories?", "author": "vikingmaiden3", "self_text": "I know from my recent research into narcissistic disorder, borderline disorder, and psychopathology that a lot of the time the abused person is left and in a horrible way. Left feeling discarded and confused. \n\nThat isn't my story, I left my NEX, and I have been unsuccessful in getting my NEX to leave me alone for a year and a half, which I am learning is because I am the one who left him and the abandonment and control loss was too much for him to handle.\n\nI'm seeking out people who has initiated the breakup themselves such as I did and want to hear their stories. Anyone can share though, this is an open safe space.\n\nI met my NEX when I was 17, he was 27. It's blatantly clear now looking back on everything that I was groomed from the very beginning, coming from a broken home with no example of healthy relationships and desperately wanting away from my heroin addict family who I paid bills for starting at 16.\n\nI was groomed into being this \"perfect\" partner for him. Obviously this started to break down after the idealization phase slowly over the years but we were together for 7 years before we got married and it was literally months after the marriage started that it got really bad. That he knew I was hooked legally and what he thought was permanently. I was injured in a bad car wreck and thats when the real devaluing started. He knew I needed him. Then my parents died and I was left with raising my teenage siblings. He really knew I needed him. The abuse just got worse and worse and I tried harder and harder to please him as is typical before understanding what is truly happening.\n\nAnyway this carried on with me trying to leave him unsuccessfully for 5 more years. Finally April 2018 I had enough and was done. I ended the relationship. He is and has always been a massive alcoholic, something I didn't realize until I was away from him. \n\nI wasn't yet aware of how abusive he was or what disorders he had and we had a divorce to go through and all that stuff, though no kids YAY. So going NC wasn't an option fully or even desired at the time considering I had next to no family left and he was all I had known my entire adult life. At 29, I had no idea what I was doing without him.\n\nIt took until this week after finding some exceptional material that finally put it all into perspective (like BAM it all makes sense finally!) and him pulling the most self centered bullcrap last weekend to be the final straw.\n\nDuring the last 18 months its been hell. I was stalked at first, threatened, he had hidden cameras and door sensors in my house I never knew about but became aware of with knowledge he'd share he shouldn't know. He was thrown out of the house because it is my house (bought with my inheritance money but had both our names on it, legally making it mine in the divorce) that he never paid a cent into beyond utilities. He needed a place to store his stuff of course despite being 39 with a high paying engineering job, he couldn't figure out how to find a place to live for a bit. Excuses to show up at my house and such. \n\nHe eventually settled on a place center of downtown, which as he told me was to both be easily able to date and drink and also close to my house (about 5-10 minute drive). He started drinking straight everclear and was completely unhinged and dangerous.\n\nI have been unable to visit downtown for over a year. The one time I did of course we happened to be in the same place at one point, me with a friend, him with a hot date (probably he knew and did this on purpose) and he accused me of stalking him and setting out to ruin his attempts to date and I was threatened and berated for months and months over it so I never went back downtown, I have to avoid it entirely. I lost SO MANY people when I came out after a couple months about how our relationship had been abusive, many people found me attention seeking and jealous or just didn't understand why I had stayed. I lost a lot of people and was very isolated. Even my best friend since I was 4. \n\nDuring this period he ended up choking me, stealing my psych meds (I am bipolar, you cant just take someones medication like that...), bruising me, threatening my teenage brother, threatening to break my legs, set my house on fire, and kill me, etc. He even called me a dick sucker  in the courthouse as we filed papers because I had started a casual relationship a month after leaving him. So he ended up with a restraining order.\n\nI want to mention at this point I had called the police many, many times and only once did they actually do anything. Sometimes I was told they didnt have enough people available to send someone out. Another time he convinced them I was the one who hurt him despite me having bruises on me. Other times they just left without anything happening aside from pissing my NEX off and putting me in further danger. I whole heartedly do not believe in the police at this point. The court house who witnessed his outburst in public there are the ones who suggested I get a restraining order, never the police. \n\nHe was then banned from the one place I do like to go when going out because his ex gf he also abused goes there as well as many other people he has upset over the years and with the restraining order he was no longer let in.\n\nThis prompted him to drive blackout drunk to my house when he found out and try to kill me. Now he could barely stand but he held me down after locking me in a room and taking my phone for over half an hour talking about how he wanted me dead and wanted to sexually assault me. He was too drunk to do either of these things luckily and my 16 year old brother who lived with me at the time heard this and called the police.\n\nHe was arrested. This is the ONLY time the police did anything for me, and it was because a minor called. They actually wouldn't even really talk to me beyond an initial statement, only wanted to talk to my brother, I was dismissed almost entirely. \n\nHis parents asked me to go to the jail the next morning and help get him out. Now I was absolutely terrified of him obviously and did this because I knew if he stayed in jail for whatever couple day period he would with it being his first offense and I didn't help him, I probably would be dead next time. \n\nI then went NC for the first time as our divorce was finalized minus the waiting period and I had the restraining order. Well 10 days before everything was legally done he hired a lawyer (we hadnt done lawyers at first) and claimed duress and tried to fight me, which he had no legal leg to stand on but still cost us 10k for a month of nothing. He then just fired his lawyer out of nowhere and reached out to me to apologize.\n\nI caved and responded. He explained why he had gotten a lawyer was to intimidate me into talking to him again. It had worked. But by then I was sucked back into the cycle. It invalidated the restraining order unfortunately.\n\nI tried to test the waters with him, afterall he'd never been arrested or attended therapy before and now he was so maybe this was the wakeup call he needed? I know, I shake my head at myself.\n\nAnyway this lasted about a month. We went a concert together. I saw an old friend who offered me back stage passes, I declined saying I was with someone. He then minutes later ends up somehow convincing the drunk girl near us to make-out with him (what?) in front of me just to mess with me. I left. I gave up attempts at trying with him.\n\nStarted dating a guy I actually really liked about 3 weeks after that, successful, handsome, etc. The first guy I had met that I actually liked enough to put some effort into beyond casual. Well my NEX found out about this two weeks into this relationship and literally moved himself back into my house. This obviously ended the relationship with that guy, which is what my NEX intended because he couldn't handle me having actual feelings for anyone else.\n\nI was terrified of him so I didn't know how to get him to leave my house. He still had his apartment but he stayed with me all the time. I was having constant panic attacks and reliving the trauma of the 12 years of abuse on top of the recent him trying to kill me and stalking and everything. He would threaten me and made it clear if I ever involved police again he'd hunt me down for the rest of my life and end it. With the track record of police not helping I was too sacred to do anything. So I lived in hell for over a month. He tried to use the animals as an excuse as well so I bought him a puppy so he'd leave me and my animals alone. This actually kinda helped but still I dont recommend because to him it showed I still cared and such. Anyway.\n\nThen I met someone while out and away from him, which was a rarity as he barely ever let me out of his sight as he worked from home and I did too a lot and it being holidays so time off work. I ended up in a relationship very quickly with this person, largely because I was looking for a way out of dealing with my NEX and this guy wasn't afraid of him or to stand up to him, something no one else I'd ever met had been willing to do but also because we had an instant connection.\n\nMy NEX moved out that day we started dating because I threatened him with police if he didn't.\n\nThe next 10 months, leading to now, have been him trying to end the relationship. It worked at one point. \n\nHe started dating a \"younger version of me\" half his age and parading her around making sure I knew details and how much more fun and exciting and so on his life was and it did get to me. It also triggered in me that I had once been a 21 year old (ew on him being 40!) who was manipulated by him and I felt bad for her. I never looked her up, refused to get involved, or anything because she wouldn't believe me and it would just piss him off. But it still got to me. Made the panic attacks worse. I ended up put on PTSD medication that helped immensely.\n\nUnfortunately the side effects of that was a more calm ability to communicate with him. We started talking again more regularly and he was supposed to move as soon as his supervised probation was up (in June) and he asked me for help with that, to say he was no longer a threat, so he could move out of the city with his new gf. I agreed because I just wanted him to go.\n\nI ended up out drinking the night of anniversary of when I left him and of course we saw each other, hence why I don't normally go anywhere in this city, but it led to us sleeping together. I regret this out of everything I have done the most.\n\nI had never cheated and despise cheaters but he worked my insecurities and it happened. Then it happened again after he started blackmailing me into ruining my relationship by telling (long story but my therapist didn't think sharing that info with my then boyfriend was a good idea for several reasons) so I kept seeing him and we slept together and it became this mess. He broke up with the girl he'd been seeing soon as he thought I was hooked again after his probation became unsupervised. When I didn't leave the guy I was seeing he got pissed and things got worse. He of course didn't move like he said he was going to and just kept blackmailing me and manipulating me. He now also was done with court mandated therapy and it became clear he literally only used what he had learned in there to better manipulate people. But he wasnt required to go back anymore. \n\nEventually I had enough of the blackmail and told my then boyfriend about it all. As expected and should have happened for his sake, he left. I ended up having a total breakdown and went into a hospital for a week, my now ex boyfriend agreed to watch my house. When I came out he said he understood my NEX was insane and didn't blame me and wanted to try again but I had to agree to cut all contact. \n\nThis is when I noticed my NEX had to be monitoring my internet traffic because he started texting me things that made no sense otherwise (I am also an IT engineer). Of course he was, he had a back door in my router (I'd already bought all new equipment but as a security engineer... he gets in regardless). But what he did was uncover some stuff on the guy I'd been dating that he knew would cause me to end the relationship and it did once he showed me when I confronted him for monitoring my traffic.\n\nHe then, the night of the breakup literally, moved in. It took 3 weeks before he started being crazy abusive again. Drinking at 10am, screaming, hitting the walls, putting me down to the point I couldn't function. \n\nI had some medical procedures, expensive out of pocket in the 10s of thousands, stuff coming up. He knew I had no one with no family (my brother had moved out at this point and couldnt help) and my ex bf being gone. So he thought he could start it all over again.\n\nIt didn't work I ended up reaching out to my ex boyfriend, who is a really decent person just with some incompatibilities, and asking for help and he agreed. My NEX was furious claiming he should be there to help instead of this ex and so on, it got bad. He started doing selfish stuff towards me during my recovery, which I am still in. Thats when I started really listening and researching and reading on whatever I could find to help me exit this situation once and for all.\n\nWhich is where I am now. NC day 5.  No plans to contact him again and haven't even checked the spam on my phone despite me being afraid he will randomly show up drunk, as he has done dozens of times. \n\nAnyway, I am sure and so is my therapist, that when he realizes I am 100% done and NC for real he is going to flip. I am scared of what may come but also empowered and have a bigger support network now that I have become more open with everyone about the entire situation. I do feel I will have to eventually move and then I can change my phone number, purge all electronic equipment, and start a new life to fully get away from him. Soon As I heal from my procedures I plan to do just that but it'll take me into the new year a ways unfortunately. I can only hope NC leads him to find a new (poor) person.\n\nIt was suggested I share my story and read that of others to continue to healing process and remind myself to stay NC no matter what he does.\n\nI never again want to be a pawn for his emotionally stunted soul. I never want to allow him to cause me or anyone I know harm or let him ruin a relationship I have with someone (I also did that of course). I want to heal and grow and stay NC and move on with my life, my career, regaining who I am, having a family in the next couple years, etc.\n\nMaybe this can help someone else feel less alone or just remind people why NC is a good idea or make someone feel better about having been left instead of doing the leaving and facing the consequences of what happens in that case. Whatever it is, thanks for reading and I hope I am able to read some of your stories too.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My home life isn't, the best, but I won't go into detail about that right now, I didn't know how relationships worked at the start, and I tend to be a people pleaser. During the first few months of the relationship it was perfectly fine, hell I even went up to the city where he was living at the time for my 18th birthday. Then he moved out to where I live, and then it snowballed from there. He started acting like a complete ass, telling me that if I wasn't Christian he wouldn't love me anymore, told me that if I ever hurt myself he wouldn't give a shit, that he wanted to rape me, ect. I was desperate, so i tried fixing everything. A few months after that, it came to light that he had a porn and masturbation addiction and straight up told me he was loosing feelings for me. Then, he had to move into his abusive sisters place because he wasn't trying to get a job out here at all. This whole time I was trying my hardest to be what he wanted, but after months of crying everyday because of him, I broke.\n\nThat's when I started calling him out for his behavior, because he was also letting his sister know too much about our relationship, which resulted in her calling me a slut for getting an IUD (mind you, I'm still a virgin). So after a month or so of telling him what was hurting me, just for him to say that it was my fault, he decided we should take a break, twice. The first time, he downloaded grindr about an hour after that so he could immediately go get dicked, which I told him that he shouldn't tell me about, and he told me that he didn't have to care about me since he wasn't dating me. Cut to 3 days later and he's over at my house and telling me that he wants an open relationship for the time being, and I went numb at that and said sure.\n\nCut to a month later, and a really horrible date at the mall where he berated me in public after I told him that I didn't feel like he wanted to be there, he decides to go on another break, this time not talking to each other for a week, which I immediately said was a bad idea, but he told me to shut up and deal with it. So I talked to both of my friends about it, which, one of them is going to school to be a therapist, and the other one was emotionally abused by him for 7 years and dodged a bullet by not dating him, they both said to run before he gets the chance to break up with me. So about 6 days after that, I'm with my friend who was also abused by him, and they tell me that he was talking about me, calling me a psychopath, abusive, a horrible person, that I'm just like my mother, that I'm not grateful for the 99 cent cup he bought me, ect. At that point, I sanp, and I call him out for it, to which he then tells me all of this in a voice call, and then breaks up with me.\n\nSo for a few days after, he was rubbing salt in the wound, saying how he was going to find a man to dick him down, how he wants to immediately get back into dating yadda yadda, to which I said \"hey that hurts, please stop telling me this\", he then blows up at me, and threatens to cut himself with the knives he took from me (he manipulated me into handing them over because he lied about one of my friends hurting themselves because of me, because I didn't want to group voice call much) and refused to ever give them back because \"I took his porn away\". So a few days after that, everything was calm, until his sister called my mother, called me a suicidal whore, and lying about me stealing my mother's weed, and how me and my friends were harassing him, even though I didn't text him for a solid day at that point, and no one else harassing him either.\n\nI texted him about it, to which he said that he couldn't talk to me anymore, to which I then blocked him and kicked him from a server I ran. He attempted trying to make himself the victim to my two friends, telling them that I was lying about all of it, which the minute they saw evidence of what he did, they both blocked him. So now, I'm going to college, I'm going to be finally seeing a therapist soon, and getting treated for my ADHD. Coping has been, not great at points, I had to drag myself out of an eating dissorder and self harm dissorder, and I still feel sick when I think about him, but after breaking the porn infested phone he gave me, ruining a hoodie that he didn't want back and giving it to my dog as a toy, and blocking him from everything after he tried slandering me the first time, I can finally say that I'm at peace with never speaking about him again. I still want my knives back though.\n\nTlDr; My garbage ex boyfriend manipulated me for 8 months, which, I haven't even mentioned it all here, and didn't even know me for a full year before I had to block his ass. So for the past 3 months I've coped in the best way I know how to, being the better person and getting on with my life.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I read a book recently called Confessions of a Sociopath. It was a brilliant read, if not a little triggering, but I couldn't trust that it wasn't for the authors own gain. I accepted and understood her perspective, as an empath, I related to her views but on a level that I could never truly comprehend. I think it's likewise in reverse - it certainly seemed so from the book. We can't ever really understand how they see life either. It doesn't make sense to us. \n\nI am everything he lacks. And he is everything I lack. He lacks understanding, care, empathy, pstience, tolerance, and philosophy. I lack logic, callousness, ruthlessness, and total objectivity (which are, actually, very beneficial traits in some areas, such as business and decision making). You would think those two halves would make a whole. But they make a hole. Because the empath never gets the human experience that they would from any non-sociopathic human being. But the sociopath/narcissist/psychopath gets everything they want.\n\nI am everything he lacks. Which means he gets those things, and I don't. He is everything I lack, which means I get those things and he doesn't.\n\nThis is co-dependency. And this is why we feel stuck in abusive relationships. We feel there should be give and take on both sides, but both sides only boost one person, and that person is the abuser.\n\nBut it sounds logical enough to trick anyone into thinking the situation is mutually beneficial.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u2019m experiencing a lot of cognitive dissonance and I\u2019m hoping someone will be able to help me out here. \n\nFirst and foremost, I met this guy while visiting friends in a different city. He came to visit me in my hometown, and everything went well, but gradually communication faded after he left and I decided to block him...I think my intuition was guiding me to do so. \n\nAnyway, some signs I think he may have been a narc: he told me one of his exes wrote a book about narcissism, and that this book was based on him. He, of course, denied being a narc. That should\u2019ve been enough to send me running, but I decided to stick around.\n\nHe also belittled me, in a way I first thought was playful banter, but gradually turned into something toxic. For example, he would poke fun at my hairstyle (I have a bob with bangs)...eventually I told him to stop as I was very sensitive about my hair (ironically or not so ironically my narc ex also poked fun at my hair). He tapered off in his comments, but would still make the occasional quip about my hair here and there. \n\nPerhaps, most notably, was his lack of empathy. One night, I ended up getting frustrated and slightly teary-eyed that he was withholding sex (after all, weren\u2019t we supposed to be all over each other?! It was only the beginning stages!). The next morning he said to me \u201ccrying is a boner killer\u201d. It was as if he was attempting to shame me. Later, however, he did apologize. \n\nThen there was one weekend he went completely MIA and didn\u2019t respond to several of my messages. When he finally did get in contact, I expressed my concern over his lack of communication to which he immediately responded \u201cI was busy, sometimes people just get busy and it isn\u2019t all about you...but I apologize and it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d Well, guess what friends? It happened again, communication became very spotty after he came to visit me which is what motivated me to cut him off.\n\nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m admittedly very paranoid. Perhaps he was just a regular guy who had poor game and lost interest in me. \n\nAny feedback would be helpful here. Either way, he\u2019s blocked and I have absolutely zero intention of ever speaking to him again.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I spent months after that trying to get into contact with me and he would just tell me he\u2019s working on him (he\u2019s not we share mutual friends and is back with his ex, binge drinks, and abuses drugs) then ultimately ghosting me.

I\u2019ll keep it short and thanks in advance for your advice and for reading!\n\nI was in my first serious relationship/engagement of 3.5 years that ended this past April. Last summer, we attended couples therapy (3 sessions) and after the first session, the therapist pulled me aside in private to tell me \u201cshe has narcissism.\u201d I read up on narcissism following that session and everything lined up. My ex\u2019s father is also a textbook narcissist. \n\nAnyway- fast forward to this year. My ex did the final \u201cdiscard\u201d of me in early April. I have been in no contact for the last 7 months. \n\nMy ex randomly blocked me on Facebook about 3 months into NC. Which I found odd because we were not friends on Facebook. I found this out when a \u201cmemory post\u201d popped up and her name was no longer attached. I\u2019ve hidden memory posts since then.  And about a month ago, I heard that my ex had actually been seeing someone new since January. Which I had no idea at the time as the final discard happened in April. It\u2019s crazy how good they can hide things! I found this out through a casual friend. And I no longer talk to this friend. I\u2019m trying hard to move forward. \n\nAnyways. I have been through months of CBT therapy and honestly have felt much better since the breakup. But this is where I need your all\u2019s help. \n\nI have met someone amazing. In absolutely all ways. She understands and has actually researched what I have went through so she gets it. She is patient with me and kind and understands that I still get triggered and \u201cpanic\u201d and have anxiety coming out my ears over things that remind me of my ex fianc\u00e9. The bad thing? I met her only 2 months after the discard. But she has stuck around through this rocky healing process all this time. \n\nMy question: how do you navigate new relationships after a narcissistic relationship? My ex fianc\u00e9 is the only relationship I\u2019ve ever been in. I have never known a \u201chealthy\u201d relationship from family or friends.

It\u2019s hard to know where to start when you wanna talk about what happened to you.\n\nI\u2019m 32 (f)years old and was abused when I was 12 years old. My perpetrator was my cousin who was 30 something years old at the time.\n\nMy family was on vacation in Spain. One night, all the adults came back wasted from a family dinner. We had two condos right next to each other. My parents went to bed in theirs and idiot me begged to sleep at the condo next door because I wanted to wait on my brother who was suppose to arrive shortly after.\nWell,  my older brother who was my favorite human in the whole world never showed up. \nI ended up staying alone in the condo with my male cousin who was like a brother to me. He told me to lay down as it was getting late and I did. He told me he was going to hold me to help me fall asleep and I was cool with that. I was the baby in the family and always spoiled by the adults around me.\nHis intentions were others, he started touching me everywhere slowly and then asked me to touch him back. I knew it was wrong but I was too afraid and shocked to say anything. He made me perform oral sex and then fingered me.\nOnce he was done with me he told me I wasn\u2019t the innocent little girl he thought I was. He convinced me that I had seduced him and told me not to tell anyone.\nI was so confused and remember peeing all night long. I had to go use the restroom every 10 minutes or so. At the next day he was a different human with me. When no one was watching he would tell me \u201cyou are not a girl, you are a full blown woman and you are just pretending to be innocent\u201d \u201clittle girls don\u2019t act like you do\u201d.\nHe would bully me and called me stupid in front of my family members but I\u2019m Hispanic so in my family making fun of others was kind of the norm.\nHe made me feel so dirty and stupid. I never told anyone.\nFast forward 20 years....It\u2019s as if for twenty years I put it in the back burner and never let it bother me. But when I had my girls everything changed. The abuse I endured haunted me. Started having night mares and decided to tell my husband. He was super supportive and heard me when I needed to be heard.\n\nWell, I never thought I\u2019d see that cousin again because he lives in Spain and I live in the US. But life had other plans. My mother (74) decided to move to Spain next door to my aunt.\nI decided it was time to tell my parents what has happened because I wanted them to understand my lack of interest in visiting them.\nWhen I told my father, he cried and asked me a lot of uncomfortable questions. My mom and I have never gotten along well so he decided to tell her for me. When he told her she had doubts of the story and didn\u2019t try to reach out to me at all. Not even a text asking if I was ok.\n\nA few months later my dad told me they both confronted my cousin and he denied all of it. He also asked them to please not talk to his family about it because it could potentially destroy his marriage. When he abused me he was dating the woman he is married to now.  My parents distanced themselves from my cousin but continued to live in Spain next door to my aunt.\n\nWell just recently in an argument with my mother where I was confronting her about the way she talks to me she starts laughing. I asked her why she was laughing and she explained that its funny to her that I confront her about the way she talks to me but not others. I asked her what she meant and she brought up my cousin. I told her I didn\u2019t think it was appropriate for her to laugh about the abuse I endured. I told her to be careful with her words because it took me 20 years to come forward with what had happened to me.\nShe looked at me and laughed again. She told me \u201cplease, you and I both know you were not sexually abused. Whatever happened between you two was just silly games and you allowed him to touch you because you were young and stupid\u201d.\n\nOh the world became silent for a moment. I believe the worst thing anyone can say to an abuse survivor came out of my own mothers mouth. I started crying frantically which is totally out of character because I\u2019m a pretty chill person in high stress situations. \nHer words broke me. My husband intervened and removed me from the situation thankfully. She crushed me so hard. How can a mom say something like this to their daughter?!\nIt hurts so bad.

The constant putdown, constantly making you hope for something that never comes. Constantly making you do things so you get to be close to them.  Promising things that will never happen. And what really helped were your words, that things won't get better. That they won't change. That it's just a tactic that they care for you in bits. I have a long list of things that happened reaching back to the beginning of the relationship. Many things she blamed me for, gaslighting me as long as necessary to believe it was me. \n\nSome things that constantly went on:\n\n* I had to prove my love to her all the time so she could be sure I'm not \"faking\" it. (Projecting?!)\n* Texting with other guys, meeting up with her ex because I was \"neglecting\" her or didn't exactly do as she says. Thus she \"felt hurt and it was your fault I'm texting other guys\"\n* Making promises, promising working on it, ultimately denying ever making them or \"forgetting\" them.\n* Trying to cut me off from my emotional support (Friends/Family) or people that doubt her action in the slightest\n* If I tried to talk about feelings/actions that hurt me she comes up with every mistake I ever made and how hurt she feels even if you improved upon them, apologised and never made them again. \n* If trying to criticize her either: Gets Angry / Starts ignoring you / Blaming you for it / Shifting topic how you're a terrible human for X reason / tries to hurt you in another way so you don't criticize again\n* Threaten to hurt herself and call the police to say I hit her\n\nThere were many more instances, some of I'm too ashamed to post here and only admitted to my best friend. It's just unbelievable how they manage to rake you back in. The thing that ultimately did it was when I called her in an emergency involving a relative a few days ago. We called an ambulance and I just needed someone to support me in that moment. Her response: Deal with it, probably nothing serious and you aren't there for me either (Referencing times when I was refusing to comfort her when I just found out she met up with her ex, the one time I had to deal with my own emotions). She had a few days off and BLOCKED me for that day. On a day I really could need someone and the first time I asked straight up for support from her. So I was getting distant and after another instance of going off about me I chose to go NC today. \n\nIt's not easy to just forget the highs of the relationships. Not easy getting out of your head that somewhere in this mess is a person that really loves you and cares for you after telling that to yourself for so long. There isn't. I will miss not her, but the good times. It will be rough for a while. I will question myself, second-guessing. But I kept hard evidence and a list of things she did to me. \n\nWhat helps is: Finding this sub, knowing you're not alone. Learning that you're often not at fault it doesn't work out. Learning that people got better after letting go, no matter how hard it seemed at first. That this is not the end of the world.

I stayed quiet for a few years, but my parents eventually found out when I was seeing a psychiatrist. I won't go into the full story here, but I was also sexually assaulted by a man when I was 15. I thought at that time and for many years, that they at least talked to my brother about what he did. Only did I find out a year ago that they never confronted my brother for his actions towards me. I was stunned. My mom wanted to say something and now regrets that she didn't, but my father insisted at the time that they didn't need to bring it up because my brother was not living at home anymore (he was away at college). My father doesn't even remember hearing that I was sexually abused. He claims to forget everything. He has had an addiction to prescription pain medicine for decades which has made him very erratic, and I guess that accounts for some of it. However, it really hurts that he doesn't remember. My father was emotionally, psychologically, and sometimes physically abusive to my mother, and I sometimes wonder if my brother learned some of his behavior from him.\n\nSo after I found out that my brother was never confronted for sexually abusing me, I decided to write him a letter. I gave it a lot of thought. I told him what he did and how it has affected me. I wasn't mean or say I was going to tell anyone. My brother replied with a vicious letter telling me that I am crazy and have been screwed up since I was a child. He told me I wasn't capable of writing the letter that I sent and that someone was helping me. I did very well in school, but I guess he has always viewed me as \"stupid\" since I am very shy and had a speech impediment when I was a young kid. He told me I am a loser since I am currently not working and have to live at home. I am on disability by the way for Depression, OCD, Anorexia, Anxiety, CPTSD, Migraines, and Seizures. He said I am a danger to society and he is the victim. The whole letter was abusive gas-lighting. I wasn't stunned at his response because he has always been very cruel to me, and in fact I experienced significant emotional abuse from him growing up. My mother knew I was writing the letter because I told her, but my brother forwarded the e-mail to her anyways because he said he wanted to show her how crazy I was. I thought she would at least tell him that he shouldn't be talking to me the way he is, but she didn't. It devastates me that she didn't defend me. We're grown, but after doing nothing when I was younger, I would have thought she would do the right thing now. She has assured me she believes me and supports me, but also that it's too difficult and she is caught in the middle. Even though she knows my brother is a bad person, she won't turn her back on him because he is her child too. I understand that to an extent, but it is just so devastating that I don't have the firm backup of my parents in regards to this. I feel so alone.\n\nMeanwhile, it just eats me up that my brother has had a good life and got away with everything. I tried to put everything from my childhood behind me, got two degrees, etc, but I broke-down trying to work. I am trying to figure things out and turn my life around, but I don't know how I can make peace with the fact that my brother never faced consequences, least of all words from my parents. It's so not fair. I am in therapy and have been for years. I refuse to speak to my brother or see him ever again. I know this has made things very uncomfortable for my mother. It's like everything is my fault. I have no friends and am so alone in life. I thought I was going to have a great life with a good job and wonderful family, but at 35, it isn't looking too likely.

Before my mum met my father, she met a guy and married him. He seemed cool (according to her) but after a while, he turned out to be a complete asshole. He wouldn\u2019t allow her to leave the house whenever she wanted, would start discussions and fights with her for no reason , threatened to harm her and (this is an assumption, she hasn\u2019t admitted it, but it seemed very possible) also physically and mentally abused her. He would hide guns around the house and made it very clear to use them if something would happen. Of course, the rebel hippie that she was, she filed for a divorce. He threw away all of her belongings and stalked her so that eventually, she would need to have some protection from some friends for a while. Eventually he let go of her and she met my dad a couple of years later.\n\nWith him, it was a similar story. He seemed nice in the beginning, but after the first few months, he turned out to be an asshole as well. He wouldn\u2019t take care of the house anymore, had her do anything and go crazy if she wouldn\u2019t do what he wanted. When I was born, he wouldn\u2019t play with me or take care of me, even though he really wanted to have a kid. I literally have no memory of him being kind to me or playing with me as a kid. He was a total maniac and choleric, would shout and throw things if he was mad. When I was six years old, I saw him trying to hit her with a belt and a short time later, he pushed her with her head against the kitchen cupboard. My mum screamed for help and I called the police. \n\nMy parents broke up and we stayed at some friends places until we got a new apartment. \nMy mum had a very good job, but would always take care of me very well. She did everything that she could and I love her to death. \n\nAfter a while of living alone, she met this guy that later became my stepdad. He played with me and would cook, cleaned up and was interested in the same things as my mum. But as you can probably guess, that was only the beginning. \n\nHis job would start later during the day and he\u2019d take me to school in the mornings. I don\u2019t know how, but somehow it started that I went into his bed to cuddle in the morning. I wasn\u2019t used to a kind father role and thought that this was a normal thing to do. He quickly turned that into raping me for more than 5 years, almost every morning during the week. In hindsight, this is ridiculous, but I thought this would be normal. He\u2019d trick me psychologically into not telling my mum and sort of blackmailed me, offering me to do fun things with him if I\u2019d have sex with him. This went on for years and my mum never realized and I\u2019ve never spoken to her about it. If she would have had any clue, she probably would have killed him. \n\nThe older I got, the more doubts I had and the more I resisted. With that, his psychological warfare started and he tried to systematically shut me down. He became negative to me, didn\u2019t want to play with me anymore, didn\u2019t support me and told me that I am bad at everything I\u2019d do. When I picked up a new hobby, he\u2019d say that I\u2019d never be good at it. When I wrote a bad test at school, he\u2019d tell me that I\u2019d be to stupid and make fun of me. \n\nOne day I heard that Michael Jackson was accused of child abuse (wether that true or not) and I realized that he was doing what Michael Jackson was accused of. I said I didn\u2019t want to continue and his warfare went to the next level. Whenever I wanted to meet friends, I had to beg on my knees for hours until it would be to late to hang out with them many times. He didn\u2019t cook for me anymore but would just \u201cprepare\u201d ready meals and wouldn\u2019t talk to me anymore. \n\nMy mum desperately tried to create a \u201cfamily life\u201d and wanted him to be part of all the decision making, but was arguing with him every day. \n\nUntil this day, I have never told her what happened. When I was a kid, I decided that she had suffered enough in her life and that I didn\u2019t want her to be disappointed again. My stepdad increasingly treated me and her worse until to the point where he is just living his life, ignoring her, saying no to everything and being negative all day. He is retired and sits on the sofa while she does everything. \n\nHe never talked to me about what happened, never apologized, nothing. But to be honest, I don\u2019t even hate him. You can only hate someone that you\u2019re having feelings for, but I actually just have disgust and disrespect for him, same for my dad. \n\nNow, years later, I am wondering if my decision to not tell my mum was a mistake or not. I didn\u2019t want her to suffer more, so I decided to go through the suffering myself, as a kid, so that she thinks that my stepdad is an asshole, but not a rapist. \n\nHe still behaves worse and worse and even has the balls to comment \u201cI\u2019d cut this guys balls\u201d on movies where rapist are portrayed in. \n\nI\u2019ve only recently realized that my life has been impacted by my past more than I\u2019ve thought. I recently went through a break up with my girlfriend and understood that I have trust and confidence issues. I am afraid not to be loved and accepted and that is really difficult in relationships. Since I am 16 years old, I am traveling around the world, trying to reduce my time in my hometown as much as I can. \n\nMy mum is thinking about divorcing from him and I don\u2019t feel bad about that at all. I am a very loving guy, but for him, I don\u2019t have any understanding. I know that pedophilia is not something that people actually are choosing, but they\u2019re still responsible for their actions, in my opinions.\n\nI\u2019ve not really talked to friends about this, but am trying to see my past as something positive. For me, having a family that loves each other is very important and it gives me a lot of power to act differently than the \u201cmen\u201d that we\u2019re my fathers. I see them as weak people they were afraid to face themselves and chose to hurt others because the couldn\u2019t deal with their feelings. \n\nIve recently stared fighting (boxing) and am enjoying that a lot. I\u2019m not a very aggressive guy, but it helps me facing my emotions. \nI\u2019m positive that I am breaking the cycle of the bad childhood and that I will provide the best for my mum and my family. \n\nI hope that this story can motivate others and put some more light into their lives. \n\nAlso, I\u2019d love to hear what you think about my decision to protect my mum. I know she would judge herself a lot for choosing a man again that is bad. I\u2019m sure she has some issues in that regard, but besides that she would hate herself knowing that her husband raped her child for years and years. I\u2019ve always told myself that if she\u2019d die before him, I\u2019d tell my story openly, but at the moment I don\u2019t even care what happens to him. I have no relationship with him and I really couldn\u2019t care less. What do you think? \n\nThanks again and share the love!", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I'm writing this because I want advice about ending my relationship with my parents. While I'm open to hearing from anyone, I'm mostly interested in hearing from people who have personally experienced familial abuse and/or ended their relationship with their parents. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSpecific things I'm concerned about:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) Finances. I live several states away from my parents and currently work a temporary, full-time job that pays $14/hour + health insurance. I also have about $10k in student loans. I'm still on my family's phone plan, but otherwise I'm entirely financially independent. Unfortunately, my mom still has access to my bank account, since we created it as a \"joint account\" when I was a teenager. I'm wondering: if I remove my mom from my bank account and get my own phone, are there any unexpected financial consequences I should prepare for? Could my parents attempt to prevent me from paying my student loans back, for example? Could they try to steal my financial identity to get back at me? Considering this, how can I protect myself financially and what steps should I take before cutting them out of my life? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Transphobia. I'm transgender and plan on legally changing my name and gender as soon as possible. However, I don't have a physical copy of my birth certificate, which I know is necessary for legally changing your name/gender in many states. My parents have a physical copy of this document. Should I try to get a hard copy of my birth certificate before cutting them off? If I can't get a copy of my birth certificate from them, how should I proceed?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Forced hospitalization or other forms of retaliation. I have friends who, after coming out to or confronting their abusive parents, were forcibly hospitalized. I don't want this to happen to me, especially in a \"conversion therapy\" kind of program. How should I protect myself from this? And how should I protect myself from other forms of retaliation (i.e. stalking; my parents showing up at my job and harassing me; etc.)? I've considered taking self-defense classes, but if there are other things I should do (deactivate social media, buy more locks for my house, etc.), please let me know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your advice &amp; support.

(Pretty graphic and long)", "author": "Mentallyundisturbed2", "self_text": "I am a 17 year old boy, and live a pretty good life. I was born with Aspergers Syndrome. I was raised by my mom and my stepdad that she married a few years ago in a upper-middle class family. I was a high school football player for one of the best high school teams in the state. I sing in my church choir, and am the Youth intern there too. I am even joining the Military. By almost all accounts I am pretty average. Except when you dig into my personal life. I was raped well over a thousand times. When I was 5 I had a babysitter and lets call her Val (Who is a Pediatric ICU RN) , Val started off nice, even baked me cookies the first time. However the second time I went there I saw her true side. She belittled me by making me clean her dog's poop and verbally abused me. I, of course didn't say anything since she scared me. She even locked me in a dark closet while my mom was at work, when I refused. Around the first month I was there, she started making me bathe at her house and \"clean and dry me off\" and told me not to tell. After a couple weeks she started making me touch her and have  overtly sexual encounters. This went on for around 2 years. Me and my mom moved. The day we moved  I told her the abuse that \"Val\" did, other than the sexual abuse. I felt very ashamed. We moved and there I was reunited with a old friend lets call her L and her younger sister and I'll call her V. I was VERY excited to finally hang out with L (around a year younger) and V (around 2 at the time). Her stepdad was a very sketchy guy, I never liked him. After about 2 or 3 months there, I caught him raping L and V. He threatened me. He also raped me that day. He continued to do so for as long as I was there. He was very violent and rough. Eventually L's stepdad was caught red-handed and sentenced to 1,000 years in prison. I moved, and to this point no one knew my secret. I was a very depressed kid after that. L's stepdad and Val broke my innocence and I felt outcasted. I couldn't let anyone else know. My mom married a guy who was physically abusive when I was 10. And 7 months later my cousin showed up, lets call her J. She is around 5 years older. She came after school ended for her (around late April) and stayed until late August. She raped me every day, multiple times a day. She was by far, the most aggressive and violent. There were sometimes I would be bleeding afterwords. She would assault me if I said no or stop and make me make up excuses like \"fell down stairs\" or \"ran into the door\", etc. My mom divorced the guy. And we moved across the country (for the 3rd time) She came back when I was 12 and she eventually moved in for 2 years. You can guess what happened for 2 years. She progressively got more violent. When I was 16, and after she left. I planned my suicide. I didn't want want my mom to find me. I was determined to go \"missing\". But I stopped and eventually saw how stupid it was for me to consider Suicide. It is a very selfish way to go. I couldn't bear the thought. For the longest time, I had PTSD. I had nightmares. I was acting out in school. I got into fights and often went WAY TOO FAR. My mom married my current stepdad when I was 14, right when J moved out. My current stepdad (former Cop) knew there was something off. He talked to me and I told him mostly everything. I was in therapy for 6 months. I haven't met the criteria for PTSD for about 2 years and have felt so much better. I have helped around 20 other male sexual abuse victims. Including 1 on 1 mentorship of one that is in my youth group. Today I have finally filed charges against L's stepdad and J and Val (in 4 states). Sorry for my long post. I just thought I'd finally tell my complete story.  \n\nTl;dr: I was raped over a thousand times by 3 seperate people over the course of my life, and today, I live a somewhat normal life.

I thought it might be worthy of a thread of its own:\n\n\nThese early red flags are very easy to overlook. In retrospect, however, one finds oneself constantly wondering how we could have ignored them.\n\nMy first flag came on the day that I left my long-term partner to move into a rented flat with my STBXW. That same evening I cooked her our first romantic meal together. It was to celebrate the start of a new life with this extraordinary woman. I'm no chef but it was OK in my opinion. I put a lot of work into trying to make it something special. \n\nHer reaction? She had an absolutely enormous tantrum because I'd apparently 'put too much lemon juice in the spinach\u2019.\n\nAt the time I couldn't believe what I was seeing. She called me names and shouted and raged. I was a 'vile' person apparently. I was astonished by her behaviour.\n\nSo I did what I should have done. I walked out of the flat and left her. If only that had been the end of it. My life would have been so different.\n\nNext day I was hoovered back in. Except, of course, I'd never heard of that term before, let alone knew what it actually meant.\n\nHer bad behaviour, I was tearfully informed, was as a result of her suffering from a condition known as polycystic ovaries. So, being me, I researched the condition and discovered that it did indeed cause dramatic mood swings. \n\nArmed with this knowledge I resolved to help her. So I spent a lot of time getting her vitamins that would help, making mood charts so we could predict her mood swings, joining forums, etc. etc. Now that I'm on armchair expert on NPD I understand that this is what they do: they draw you in with a pity play.  Often this will take the form of telling you about how they were abused by their 'crazy' ex and suchlike. In my case she chose a medical condition to do the job for her.\n\nShe also explained that she was desperate for a child and that polycystic ovaries would make it very difficult for her to conceive. I. myself, had no such craving but I hoped that even if we had unprotected sex I would get used to the idea of a baby after three years. Naturally, she was pregnant within about two weeks!\n\nNowadays, of course, she claims that she never had polycystic ovaries, and that I made the whole thing up. Fortunately, I was able to present her with an email she sent back in 2002 in which she explains that the condition is the 'bane of her life' and that she has seen numerous experts about it. 'I don't remember sending that' was her response. \n\nSo here I am 18 years later. Brutally discarded last year for a guy 25 years my junior. No home, no daughter, no wife, no alleged 'best friend'.

I know two or even three of these paragraphs sound like they belong on  r/AmItheAsshole but I didn't know if any of it should've been left out or how much context I should've provided.\n\nUsing a throwaway since I'm pretty much a coward and I don't know the \"range\" of abuse, so if it turns out I'm being some self entitled piece of  sh\\*t in the end I don't want that following me.\n\nI'm 19 now, and it all kind of stopped happening once I got into High School because of a combination of getting older and I've started \"fighting back\" (Mainly talking back to my mom and what was, in my mind, was sticking up for myself.) I have a really bad relationship to my mom, and its gotten to the point where we don't really talk anymore (We still live in the same house, my dad is trying to keep the family together. I'm also in college, so I can't exactly move out right now either). My dad always backs my mom, he's a good guy but I don't think he realizes how bad it has affected me. I thought my mom did was wrong but after hearing the whole \"I'm the mom\", \"you're disrespectful\", \"Why are you still holding onto that all this time, let it go\", I just need to know if I'm overreacting. If I'm just being a little shit, let me know. I know there are some legitimate reasons (at least I think so) I was spanked (bad grades, getting in trouble at school, etc.). I'm not gonna act like I made absolutely zero mistakes as a kid. However, during 4th grade I remember when some of my friends were really surprised that I was being spanked for handwriting. I didn't think too much of it at the time, in fact I thought some of their reactions were funny in the moment. One of my friends called it straight up abuse which, I mean,  we were like 9 at the time so today I don't really count that as \"proof\".\n\nFrom 2nd grade to around 7th-8th grade (7 years old to 12-13 years old) my mom has done the following over the years:\n\nLike previously stated, spanked me with the brush and belt for my bad handwriting (this was a popular one with my mom, stopped around the middle of middle school)\n\nWould try check my bag every night (a lot of the times she'd forget) and everything that was deemed sloppy (Papers put straight in the bag instead of the folder, notes for one class in a notebook for another class, etc.) equaled a \"lick\". (This stopped around started and stopped around 5th grade if memory serves)\n\n4th to 6th grade there were times where if we had a school project I would do it, my mom would look at it, see its not good enough and make me redo it. (I was/am a hardcore procrastinator so all of this happened the night before the project was due. Admittedly there were times I did it lazily and every time I always did the bare minimum required.) In general this wasn't really that bad in retrospect, but often times since we ended up staying up to like 4-6 AM emotions were running high. My mom would be really short tempered during this time for obvious reasons, but on one particular occasion she lost so much patience that every time I zoned out, or I kind of forgot what we were doing, I would get spanked with the belt or the wire (it started out as the belt and escalated). My dad saw this once and told my mom \"he's not going to remember that way\" and my mom said \"he'll die.\" (As in he'll die if he has to just to be clear). I understand that this was mostly out of anger one of those things that was said \"in the moment\" but I dont know, it didn't feel very good.\n\nThe above were the main ones, but there were specific times it escalated that I'll specify below.\n\nOn our way back from Church one day, she said she was going to spank me out of nowhere  when we got home and when I asked she wouldn't tell me why. At this point, I was pissed and I slammed the car door when we got out and she knew I was angry which was only going to make the spanking worse. I screamed \"I have the right to know\" at her which, well, didn't exactly help. I walked down the block while she went inside furious. My dad talked to me and told me I needed to apologize for lashing out. I went to apologize and said \"I'm sorry, I just didn't understand why I was getting spanked\". I ended up getting stripped down to my underwear spanked with a belt or the wire (like a cord you plug into a laptop, but I can't remember which one it was). That was mainly a combination of being disrespectful and the mysterious original reason. I was never told what the original reason was, and today I only have a couple of theories (I think it was disrespect to somebody at Church, but I don't know for sure). This was somewhere around middle school.\n\nI can't remember the incident that led to this, but it had something to do with my school bag. She was talking to me and said there was no reason I should cry. She said if I was about to cry, and she said if I cried she would spank me with the belt. I held in my tears the best I could, but that didn't work. I stalled for like 30 minutes saying \"I didn't do anything\". That didn't help. She spanked me with a \"rope\" (the tie back ropes you use for curtains). That hurt like a b\\*tch and I definitely needed to sit down for a minute after that.\n\n I don't remember the incident that led up to this one (it could be the final result of the church story I told above but I can't be sure), but I was spanked with the wire and it hurt so bad I ended up running downstairs to try and escape her. I went into the living room where my sister and my dad was. My dad held my hand so I could take the beating better I guess (Kind of like in the movies where you bite down on something if you're about to take a lot of pain). My mom came downstairs and demanded me to go back upstairs but I was crying, scared, and as you could imagine I was not really feeling getting spanked with a wire. I ended up getting beat on the couch a couple times in only my underwear where my dad and my sister watched. That one left me bleeding in a couple places and the \"imprint of the whip\" on various places on my skin. My dad patched me up. I still have a small scar from that one on my arm. That one messed me up pretty good not gonna lie.\n\nThe last one was when it was me, my dad, my mom in my room having this giant talk because I really hated what was going on and things escalated to where my mom  was yelling, I was super upset, and she'd put her freaking v\\*g in my face to \"show me where I came from\" or something alone those lines. That  was definitely a yikes moment for me.\n\nAll of this led to me lying to my parents and not telling various things because I was afraid of what my mom would do and stuff like that.\n\nThat's as far as the physical stuff, but she'd take her frustrations from her job out on the rest of us (verbally). To be fair, she does work almost everyday and long hours so I get it, but after a while I personally just can't take it anymore. It just seemed like no matter what I did it was never enough. Now granted, I can be pretty lazy and I am a procrastinator so I'm not going to act like it's impossible that it's not her, and that I just need to step up and get my sh\\*t together. I personally can't tell and this is about as detailed I can get without sounding bias. I started talking to myself around middle school because it didn't feel like I could talk to anyone and once my parents found out my mom would call me \"crazy\" when she was pissed or try to recommend me to people and wouldnt believe me when I said I wasn't talking to anyone, I was literally talking to myself.\n\n As far as the verbal stuff goes, I don't know if I'd call it abuse but more of just her being an \\*ss whenever possible. She tried to push me out of my current major (Graphic Design) and refuses to think I made the decision on my own (I switched from Computer Science). She would always blame us (me, my dad, my sister). for even the most simplest things. Mainly just small stuff. For example,  if she opened a closest and was doing something and then knocked something over, she would blame us for putting it there in the first place.  There would be times where she'd tell me to do something, and when I go to do it she'd end up telling me something else, and then when I go to that thing she'd ask how come I didn't do the first thing and stuff like that. A lot of times when I do something good like get a 100 on a test or something it'd just be \"now why can't you do that all the time\".  I just don't feel good enough. She's said things like \"your life is not your own, you came from me so I make all the decisions in your life\" and stuff like that. This would've been fine if I wasn't nineteen, especially since she says this while also saying \"you're nineteen you need to start doing these things on your own\". I don't really understand it. I know she's my mom  and I'm young, but shouldn't I be making some decisions on my own?\n\n She also blames me for a lot of money she'd spent over the years. I get that parents go that extra mile for their sons and daughters, but when our financial situation is pretty bad  (my dad lost his job two years ago when I graduated high school and she spent my college money in private catholic high school, and she and my dad have been struggling to pay college tuition for me and my sister these past few years, they're older parents so they're getting paid less, struggling to keep food on the table, struggling to pay the bills to the point where me and my sister are going to *have* to pay soon or else we might not be able to keep staying in this house, etc.), I don't want to do any of this anyway even getting to the point where you force me into it, and then I end up not liking it and not pursuing it further, it can't be ALL my fault. And I'm really tired of hearing the whole \"we have no money and I keep spending money I don't have\" speech when she signed herself up for Graduate School all of the sudden so now she has to pay that ontop of everything else. Not because she has to look for job opportunities and stuff, but just because its something she wanted to do for herself. Again, I understand having personal goals, and if you think you can do it, fine. But dont start complaining abou how everything's going to shit even more than before because of all these added expenses that didn't have to be there if you didn't start paying for stuff that you knowingly can't even afford anymore with full knowledge of how much we're starting to struggle financially. You knew the consequences of your actions going in, don't blame us for it. In any case, I'm starting to go off topic here.\n\nI understand that parents naturally have high expectations for their children, and they are supposed to be on your ass, but after a while it started going from harsh criticisms and being brutally honest to just straight up insulting and keeping me down. Hell, for like a solid year she started to saying \"Oops, I did a -my name-\" whenever she made a mistake. I know I'm young, so maybe it seems bad to me right now and it's not as bad as I think it is. Like those \"you'll understand when you get older\" thing. And admittedly there are some things (none of which I posted here) that have happened that I do actually understand after a while when I got older. It all started getting to me after a while and after holding it in for most of my childhood, I have anger issues now and even the most minimal stuff that she'll tell me pisses me off. I take everything so personally and recently I've been demanding respect (or at least as much respect a normal 19 year old still living in his parents house should get. I'm not saying we should be treated like equals or anything.)  I'm still really bitter about everything and my dad keeps saying I should just let it go, but I don't think I can.

I just want to know if anyone else has had similar experiences with parents (especially mothers). \n\n1. My mom dealt with her anger at me with destructive behaviors. When my mom was mad at me when I was younger (ages 10-14), she would go into my room and break or knock over the things she knew were most valuable to me. There were multiple times when I  would come home from school and see that all of my dance trophies (I was a competitive dancer all my life) were knocked off their shelf onto the floor (sometimes broken).\n\n2. My mom is consistently manipulative. Whenever she needs to win an argument, she pulls the \"how can you be so ungrateful after everything I've done for you. I gave up so much of my life for you\" card. She did do a lot for me but she consistently uses this as a crutch to guilt me into doing what she wants. She also constantly says \"If you loved me, you would *do this or do that*\" \n\n3. My mom is extremely passive aggressive. She never tells me exactly what's wrong but instead, she always makes little jabs at me to make me feel bad. For example, I will come after a night out with my boyfriend to a note on my desk that says \"go live with your boyfriend if you like spending so much time with him\" and all I did was spend a Saturday night at his place. She will say things like \"You clearly don't care about me if you're spending your time with other people so get out of this house and go live with them\" and that anytime I leave the house to have fun with friends that I am \"abandoning the family\".\n\n4. My mom consistently invalidates my emotions. My feelings are invalid in comparison to hers. If I am crying in my room, my mom will come in to tell me to \"stop crying, you have nothing to cry about. Look at how many problems I have\" and leave.\n\n5. My mom has always tried to and still does try to make decisions for me by convincing me that she is right and I'm wrong. Most of the time, she says that is if for me own good or that she knows what's best for me. She implies that I can't be trusted to exercise good judgement and that I would fail without her help.\n\n6. I have a 14 year old brother and my mom disregards his age and treats my brother like a peer. We have many illnesses in the family which cause a lot of stress and she talks to him as if he is an adult friend about things like DNRs, cancer, life and death, and lays all of her emotional needs on him. He is 14 and is expected to console her and act like an adult. I feel extremely bad for him. She then takes pride in saying \"he is so mature so I can tell him all this\" when in reality, I can see that he is often troubled by all of these conversations and she doesn't see it. \n\n7. My mom thinks I have no standards and that I'm incapable of making smart choices. She has told me \"you are always the one being picked by guys, and never the other way around\" implying that I settle for everyone that has ever looked at me. \n\n8. My mom is extremely judgmental and thinks she knows everything there is to know about someone without ever meeting them. My mom has never liked any of my boyfriends simply because they are older, or of a different race or culture and constantly belittles me for choosing \"wrong\". \n\n9. My mom rarely ever asks me about my life (classes, friends, dance etc). There has always been some kind of bigger issue in her own life that took priority. She almost never tells me she loves me or she is proud of me. \n\nHas anyone else dealt with similar things? What should I do?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

He said I was his soul mate and his happiness and that he had never felt like this before. I believed him. No one had ever made me feel like that before, he was so nice to me and said such wonderful things.\n\nFor years he told me he had left her and I thought he was my boyfriend. He had his own flat. I found out he was not only still with her but also had been seeing third girl from work for 2 years. He had told his ex he wanted space which allowed him to move out of their flat together and into his own which is how he got away with it. He convinced me he made a mistake and I was the one he wanted and I continued with him.\n\nI moved to the same city as him but did not move in with him as our relationship was now a secret as my friends and family hated him because of what happened above. He still had his own flat and our relationship continued for another 2 years. I would always question his movements and he would call me crazy, sensitive. Eg finding coffee cups with his ex name on... telling me no photos on social media as she would be upset as he had left her for me, birthday cards from her etc. He told me she would always be a close friend and if I didn\u2019t like that then we couldn\u2019t be together.\n\nOne day he declared he was moving in with his friend as he couldn\u2019t afford his flat any longer. He never invited me over there and would only come to mine which I found odd. It turns out he had bought a house with his \u2018ex\u2019 behind my back and they had been together the entire time (now 8 years). I found out as we had gone to Italy and his gf saw photos I had posted and text me telling me they lived together and had a dog. I left him. He perused me and convinced me that I was the love of his life and they had split up. I forgave him. Again.\n\nFor the past nine months he told me they share the house as he pays half of their expensive mortgage and looks after the dog when she works away. He spent 4 nights a week with me. And many weekends. It still did not add up as to why someone would share a house and so I probed him about it. Always denied it.\n\nLast weekend he jumped out of bed telling me his ex had called 20 times and their dog was unwell and left. Only later did I see that his father had posted a photo of their daughter that was born that morning. He had missed the birth as he was with me. So he says - he\u2019s since retracted that so one of those statements was to hurt me, which one I don\u2019t know.

They have a child that was born and I was totally unaware of her pregnancy and relationship. I feel like my world is ending and I can\u2019t cope and in the week of knowing this has not improved. He is still texting me during the week asking me to meet him and he loves me and asking why didn\u2019t I want a baby with him because he asked. (He had been going on and on about having a baby for the past 12 months and I said no we were not in a stable enough relationship, even last week he said he wanted to get me pregnant). I don\u2019t know how she feels either as she must have wondered where her boyfriend was going half the week each week during her pregnancy. She saw I had posted two weeks ago on twitter that he was my boyfriend and she confronted him about it so she is obviously not believing him either and watching my every move. Do I message her to tell her he was cheating throughout her pregnancy? And missed her labour and why? I can see on Instagram that they have posted photos, so he\u2019s obviously smitten and has not contacted me at all over the past two days as if I suddenly don\u2019t exist. He was constantly contacting me during the week when she and the baby were still in hospital but now they are home... nothing. Not even online at all.

But the cycle would show itself, as I learned that a good streak will always end up imploding into some event. The first time was verbal, harassing me and saying he was leaving me. Then it was that I am annoying, ugly, not funny, and that he is sleeping with other girls. Then it was bruises, played off as jokes and not knowing his own strength when playing around. He knew I had been sexually abused as a child and he sexually abused me anyways. Multiple times I left and multiple times I went back.

I felt hatred for him instead of feelings that would hurt me. Then Friday night I get a call from him, as I do every friday night where he will drunk call me. He was sober, telling me he missed me and loves me. I thought I felt nothing. Saturday night I ended up back at his place, in his arms, and I'm scared.

I have been No Contact for 25 years from her and married to a great woman for 20 years.  Back then the Internet was in its infancy so I never had a resource like this site to reference,  it took me years to finally put all the puzzle pieces together as to what the Hell had happened with my NEX.  I had been in other relationships of course but -as we all now know-a breakup with a Narc is just too surreal compared to a normal split. I must admit I was surprised at how Angry I became when I realized what had happened with my Nex all those years ago-but I also have taken solace in the fact that there was absolutely nothing I could have done differently-it was a con job from the beginning.  I saw more red flags than at a Soviet Victory Parade! But -just like every other survivor- I explained them away to myself-our first date she Admitted she had never been faithful to any of her past boyfriends and admitted that several of them had refused to talk to her post breakup.  It all seems so clear now-but hey you live and learn-I moved down to her home state and after about 3 months I began to experience what is now recognized as the devaluation phase-she was definitely a covert Narc in retrospect- also had a drinking problem but I fell big time during the love bombing phase-she was artistic and very attractive she reminded me of Michelle Pfeiffer- but a drunk, mentality unstable Michelle Pfeiffer! I can recognize the triangulation phase because there always seemed to be some old \u201cfriends\u201d off on the periphery with her.  She never apologized for any of her abuse-but she was so subtle about it-her mom was a Narc-I heard stories of her brother the\u201dGolden Child\u201d and her sister the \u201cBlack sheep\u201d  but once again in the moment none of that registered with me.  I was discarded and wound up moving back home after 3 years of absolute weirdness-I wrote her a letter after I had been away from her for a month and told her that the girl i knew in the beginning was just an illusion and that she was not a good person and that she had to hurt people for some reason and I also told her to never come looking for me and I went no contact-now remember this was 25 years ago-I have been glad to find out I did everything right as far as dealing with a narc-before I realized what I had been through.

A few  points were personally difficult for me (such as 7), however this list has helped me more than anything else I've come across regarding healing from Narcissistic Abuse, I hope it is okay to share it here? \n\n1.) Accept the fact that you will probably never get closure.\n2.) Accept the fact that you are no different to anyone else who came before, or after you. \n3.) Accept the fact that you weren't 'special' enough to change them. We cannot re-wire another beings mind or experiences. ***Don't feel like you've failed***. \n4.) Accept your feelings, the good, the bad, and the ugly. ***Feel*** your hurt, allow yourself to mourn and grieve. Remember this is no ordinary breakup. This is the death of your old self, your ideals, your innocence, the idea of your 'soulmate'. Allow yourself to feel anger and rage.\n5.) Feelings will interrupt your life at the best of times and the most random moments. Learn to not be inconvenienced by such feelings.

He has anger issues and usually lashes out around immediate family. When I was younger I was pretty defiant, refusing to go to bed and all that. Most of the time he would chase my up the stairs and spank me when he reached me. He would rip open my door and slam the door handle through the wall, making a whole. My bedroom door has a large crack through it from many hard slams and stuff. There are many patches in the walls from where he would punch through them. When I was younger his anger would honestly just scare the shit out of me. \n\nHe doesn't quite act like this now because I'm a lot older now and I'm sure he knows I would be willing to fight back.\n\nI have had an anxiety disorder (diagnosed) for as long as I can remember and I am medicated and have counselling. I don't know if this is caused by his outbursts/was born with it/some other event, I never went over it with my counsellor or doctor because I would always want my mom to come in with me and I wouldn't talk about that in front of her.\n\nToday my sister was complaining about typical teenager stuff. How she wanted a new phone and how hers was outdated. When she walked away my dad muttered something along the lines of \"fucking bitch\" under his breath. My mom said \"What did you just say?\", and he said \"You heard me.\" That made me mad so now here I am wondering if he is considered abusive or I'm overreacting. He never exactly \"beat\" me but he has hit me many times before with spankings and all that. It's mainly the anger issues that really made me scared.\n\nToday I try to avoid talking to him because I find every little thing he does pisses me off. From the sounds he makes when he eats, how he ties his shoes, whatever bullshit I come up with in my head. I think I'm just making excuses for myself to avoid him. \n\nSo essentially what I'm asking is, should I be more sympathetic to him for not being able to contain his anger or am I right for being angry with him.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I desperately need somewhere to vent before I move forward in attempting to seek justice. I also need to warn other young women and even under-age girls about these women.   Suzanne Borders is a serial rapist of women. And her frenemy \n\nKelsey Amara is just as bad, maybe even worse (she likes \\*young\\* girls).  \n\nI met Suzanne in a strip club I danced in. She ordered me \n\nfor a VIP (private dance). She was very lewd, far more forward than most male customers, and she took liberties. After, she asked for my number. Against my better judgment, I gave her my number. But I told her I was in a relationship with a guy. Borders asked me out, just hounded me repeatedly for months. She said she\u2019d wait it out. She did. He dumped me not long after for his high school sweetheart. \n\nI was really down about the breakup, but I went into dance \n\nthat week at the club anyway. Suzanne was there that night. She approached me after she ordered another dance in the V.I.P. I expected her to ask me out again, already on my guard. But she surprised me. She said she could see that something wasn\u2019t right and that if I ever wanted to talk to someone who had been through her share of bad breakups, to call her. Anytime. She also gave me the number of a really great therapist. There didn\u2019t seem to be anything ulterior coming from her. No come ons.   \n\n\nIt changed the way I looked at her.  \n\nI ended up calling her not long after. We talked about so many things that night, and not once did she really try to take advantage of my rebound status. We were actually friends after that, and I felt she was someone that I could count on. \n\nA few months later she asked me out, but she explained that it was all pretense. A friend from back home was flying in and she really needed the buffer. She implied that the woman was her sister and that their relationship was contentious at best. So I agreed, even though I felt awkward about being in the middle of a family squabble.  \n\nI was expecting a bar and was relieved when she took me to restaurant downtown. The other woman was waiting for. Pretty with long hair and brown eyes, she was very small. She made me feel like a giant at 5\u20195\u201d. She looked me over shrewdly, then frowned a little like she was hurt and trying to work the problem of my presence out in her head. She recovered and said her name was \u201cKelsey\u201d.  \n\nYes, the same Kelsey Amara I mentioned in my opening paragraph. She was very boisterous and combative in her arguments with Suzanne, and it got worse as a second round of beers arrived. A family was seated few tables down when Amara looked over a girl at their table, commenting on her \u201cbuttery thick thighs\u201d and how she\u2019d \u201clike to put her face between them, show her heaven\u201d. The girl couldn\u2019t have been more than 14. It was grotesque, even considering the things I\u2019d seen and heard as a stripper. \n\nI finished my second beer and ran to the restroom, needing a break. Understanding why Suzie had wanted a wingman. I could hear them arguing about Kelsey\u2019s boorish behavior as I walked away. When I got back, there was a third round of beers. The tone had changed. I saw them holding hands, both quiet, looking at each other across the table. It felt intimate. They saw me and pulled apart. \n\nI felt nervous, and I did what I always do then. I drank. I finished the third beer, knowing it had been a mistake. A very bad mistake. I got up again and fell over. I heard Suzanne say she would get me home, then felt hands on me, helping me up\u2026removing my clothes, touching and fondling and kissing me roughly.\n\nI woke up from this in the back of a stranger\u2019s car, with both Suzie and Amara in the front arguing with each other. My vagina was on fire, and so was my anus. I wondered, stupidly, what had happened. They pulled up at a stop, seeing I was awake. They both looked a little panicked. \n\nThey got me upstairs to my place. I noticed the car was a green hatchback, a Subaru I think. Amara\u2019s. I could smell my sex on both of them. I felt so humiliated. Amara told me I had been wonderful, though a bit too aggressive toward her. Suzie told her to \u201cshut up\u201d and said that I was simply gorgeous. That I was always gorgeous, and she wouldn\u2019t hold any of the things I had done to her sexually against me, or expect anything more. I was passionate, she said. And she was tough, she could take the bruises I left.  \n\nI just stared at them dumbfounded. Then I whispered that I didn\u2019t remember anything after the restaurant. They made a quick retreat after that.  \n\nOnly later did I realize what had happened. They had planned this before Suzanne asked me to go the restaurant. They had staged it then drugged my drink while I was in the bathroom. Rohypnol, that\u2019s what I was sure they had used on me.  \n\nI confronted Borders about this. She of course denied everything, accusing me of making a pass at Kelsey, who was herself an assault survivor. She then told me that the three of us had consented to a threesome that night, which I had initiated by pursuing \u201cher good friend\u201d. And that Kelsey was the one who was now afraid. Afraid of ME. That they were each other\u2019s witnesses to my violent behavior toward \u201cpoor Kelsey\u201d. That no one would believe different when they looked at and heard from her. \n\nShe implored me to say nothing, because she had just barely been able to talk Kelsey out of filing charges against me for the exceedingly physical sex acts I performed on her. Many, she explained, that Kelsey was not happy with at all. \n\nI backed down. Thinking I was in the wrong. I even thought about apologizing to Kelsey! \n\nThat was until I started hearing similar stories from female acquaintances that also knew Borders and Amara. Some had friends that had told them the same things I had. Others had experienced it firsthand. Sexual abuse through coercion in some cases, in other cases the casting couch. In more cases I heard the word I was afraid to use: rape.  \n\nSexual assault and battery following a night of drinking. Usually with terrible wooziness midway through the night, with women waking up to the feeling of terrible internal bruising and the feeling of rough sex.  \n\nNow a number of us are willing to tell our stories. And charges are being looked into. Lawsuits will be coming against these two.  \n\nAny woman that has contact with these two should be very careful. Never go anywhere alone with them. Do not allow them to bully you through job offers. And please please PLEASE do not leave your under-age daughters alone with Kelsey Amara. She was abused as a child and now she does the same to teens and pre-teens.  \n\nCurrently Suzanne Borders runs a company called Bad VR.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I'm on mobile so excuse any errors. \n\nI'm an 18 year old male, I just graduated high school, and I've only had 1 gf bc I was never really the most social and preferred to keep to myself and never opened up to anyone due to past experiences with bullying. \n\nWhen I was 15 I met this girl that I ended up dating her until January of this year (I was 17 at the time and turned 18 in June). At first she seemed amazing and was instantly attached (being young and dumb and not taking time to get to know her). We had everything in common. Music taste, style, interest in movies and shows, etc. \n\nProblem was I soon found her to be controlling and manipulative. Everytime something didn't go her way she made it seem like my fault and was quick to say our relationship was ruined, we should break up, or that I should go with someone else to whatever since I didn't love her and that she wasn't my type. \n\nSometimes it would get to the point where she would threaten suicide and leave me for hours crying and worried and calling her constantly only to find out she really just went to sleep or watched a movie with her mom. There were times where she wouldn't want to work things out and made me \"prove\" my love for her which being in a fragile state would leave me to cutting myself (in one instance I cut her initials into my wrist) and ofc having s** with her despite me not really wanting it. I worked a part time retail job and never had much money but what little I did would go to her bc I didn't love her if I didn't buy any gifts for her. She didn't trust me having any female friends and forced me to cut off friends I've had for years and on the rare occasion I got to see my best friend who lived a town over than me she would berate me for not spending time with her instead. I couldn't enjoy my love for professional wrestling bc she claimed I only watched it for the women and that I loved wrestling more than her. There were even times where I would stay up until 3 am on school nights with her bc if I didn't then you guessed it... I didn't love her. It got to the point where I got kicked out of my mentorship program and I nearly didn't graduate due to failing English. I don't even have my drivers license since she saw it as a way for girls to \"want to get with me\" and she didn't like that. Best part about this is that I wasn't allowed to have feelings and she always made it a point to make me feel like my emotions and mental state didn't matter and that I was worthless. \n\nI put up with that for 2 years and when I got the courage to leave she called me while I was sleeping (something she did a lot when we got into fights) to yell at me for leaving her and got with someone else to make me jealous and want her back (her exact words).\n\nTo this day I'm still not over it. I've tried pursuing other relationships but I just can't bring myself to get into that again since I'm afraid of being abused like that again. I've picked up smoking and drinking since then and have found myself being super self destructive whenever I think about what happened. I'm afraid to commit to anymore relationships bc of what happened and I can't bring myself to love anyone else (not even my best friend) yet I get super lonely from time to time and want someone but I can't bring myself to it out of fear of being abused again. \n\nI hope my story helps someone in a similar situation that I was in. If you feel like you aren't being treated right then please get out of it no matter what the other person labels you. If you see red flags get out bc they're only gonna get worse. \n\nPs if anyone has any tips for me on how to overcome emotional abuse and learning to love again please comment or send anything my way!", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

He started with love bombing and made me feel special and like he enjoyed getting to know me, but a few months after we started seeing each other he got more and more distant and changed his story from not wanting anything serious to needing me for comfort practically every few weeks. \n\nAbout six months in I found out he had another long term girlfriend that he\u2019d never once mentioned, and when I confronted him about it he said they were just friends and if it made me uncomfortable we didn\u2019t have to see each other, then immediately came over for sex. That behavior continued and it took three times confronting him before he finally admitted he\u2019d been lying to me. A year later I found out he\u2019d done the exact same thing with a third girl, not to mention all the girls he was sleeping with on the side. I literally had to corner him WITH the other girl he\u2019d been lying to before he told the truth. \n\nThat\u2019s just the top of the iceberg as far as manipulation and gaslighting. By the end of the first year of our \u201cdating\u201d he wouldn\u2019t barely kiss me and insisted on my constantly giving him sexual favors without anything in return. He acted like his exes had all hurt him and his parents were awful even though he was very wealthy and still lived at home. He gave out backhanded complements, he refused to hang out with my friends or invite me to things with his friends unless I relentlessly begged, and even then he\u2019d actively flirt with other girls in front of me. After two years in we\u2019d practically have to both be drinking heavily in order to be around each other physically. Looking back on it his actions were pretty much straight out of some sort of incel handbook. \n\nI finally got the courage to leave him after I\u2019d been broken down to feeling like nothing. I know I put up with all of that because I was barely even a legal adult and had only been in longer term monogamous relationships in high school so I had no point of reference, and he was comforting at first when I felt all alone. No excuse, but I didn\u2019t know better.\n\nStill even now a couple years after breaking it off, I get these awful feelings that I was the toxic one in the relationship, because I did yell at him and text him a lot every day by the end of it; I didn\u2019t trust him and constantly questioned everything; I practically begged him to spend time with me and kiss me and sleep with me even when he was acting indifferent half of the time; I slept with other people just to spite him. I know I should have left way sooner and really I think that was my one true mistake. Still I regularly question if I was the abusive one...

But tonight, she touched me in a certain way, I think, or maybe something else happened. I don\u2019t know what. But something happened and I felt like I was taken back to my early childhood. I suddenly saw myself in my bedroom during a sleepover with someone who at the time was one of my closest friends. And we were naked because he told me it would be fun. But I hated it. I never liked being naked as a child. But he seemed to think it was normal and I was a wimp so I did it. \n\nAnd he made me perform oral on him. We were young. Maybe 4th grade. Maybe a little younger. He touched me after, even though I told him I was tired and I just wanted to go to sleep. After, I waited for him to fall asleep in my sleeping bag before crying quietly until I fell asleep too. And then? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember the next day. I don\u2019t remember how I handled it as a kid. And truth be told, I didn\u2019t even remember it until tonight.\n\nAnd after my girlfriend touched me, I panicked. I yelled at her and told her to stop. I couldn\u2019t process everything and I didn\u2019t explain what had happened and we fought. She told me something was clearly bothering me and I told her it was nothing. I wasn\u2019t ready to deal with it. And things escalated for a while. Eventually we made up, but I still didn\u2019t tell her the truth. I don\u2019t know if I ever will. I don\u2019t know what to do now. \n\nShe is asleep now, but so much has started to make sense in my life after remember this event. I cry after sex in the bathroom, I stopped inviting friends to my house for almost a decade, I got so anxious every time I went to a sleepover that I would make myself sick. I have nightmares sometimes about being tricked into having sex with people. \n\nIf you had asked me yesterday, I would tell you that I didn\u2019t have a traumatic childhood, and I was just an unhappy kid because of bad luck, a chemical imbalance. \n\nNow, I\u2019m not so sure. But I don\u2019t know if this is abuse. I don\u2019t know if what I experienced makes me a survivor. It was only the one time. And for all I know, he could have just been curious. He was the same age as me. How does one child sexually abuse another? He probably didn\u2019t know he was doing any damage. Does that mean it wasn\u2019t abuse? I just don\u2019t know where to go from here. \n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to him in almost a decade. We grew apart in the years after that night. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that this post is so long. And I\u2019m sorry it probably isn\u2019t well written or organized. I am feeling very raw from the events of tonight. I keep crying.

How do I get out of this narcissistic friendship?!", "author": "Raiiised", "self_text": "Hello everyone!  \nI found this subreddit yesterday, and even tho I'm not in a romantic relationship with this person, this subreddit spoke to me so much. I recognise so many things. Let me tell you a bit over this friendship, that could be a legit soap opera tbh.  \nTo summarize:  \nI met this person 3 years ago online. We instantly clicked and talked all day. Over the course of 3 years he has done horrible things to me. First, he catfished me. (He told me it was because of a bet, he suddenly acted like he was his cousin and that I never talked to the person I thought I talked to. Ofc I found out it was bullshit and forgave him. It wasn't because of a bet tho, he was just bored). He lied about his gender. (I found out myself, but then he admitted to me he didn't feel like his gender. He was transgender. So I forgave him, respected him and I helped him come out, helped him set the first steps to being the gender he wanted to. I even flew to his country to get him to the doctor and help him out with all that. Ever since I've been the only friend that's supported him with this). He mentally abused me in all kinds of ways. (My cousin died to a drug overdose, instead of being there he told me my family sucked and we should be ashamed of ourself. And also that I had no right to mourn over him since according to him it was my own fault I didn't see him in a while, even tho he didn't know shit about the whole situation). He used my insecurities, biggest fears and troubles against me. (I am at sickleave from work and I hate it, he knows but tells me I'm a joke to society for sitting at home and i don't deserve to get paid while at sickleave and I should be ashamed). He has told me multiple times to kill myself, jump in front of a train, take a knife and end it (even tho he knows I had suicidal thought beginning this year and it's very real for me). Also told me he hoped I would die, my friends would die and my parents would die. He is very downgrading about my job, saying I'm 'only a poopscraping nurse'. Meanwhile thinks he is the best and gets everything handed to him 'because he is just that good' &lt; his literal words. He is very ungrateful, Ive given him way too many gifts i shouldnt have, but also created a second home here in my country where he could live as the gender he wanted to and EVERYONE here would treat him like it. (I made sure everyone would). My parents opened their hearts for him, invited him to dinner multiple times (not once he said 'thanks for the lovely food' or whatever). My friends all let him in. Just for him to shit all over us. He said he doesn't like any of us and that he doesn't owe us anything, not even respect. He has tried to replace me multiple times for 'better' people, just to come back after a while when that went to shit too. And then he wonders why I have trustissues. But ofcourse he blames me for those and not the fact that he threw me aside 20 times for someone else. He never sees his own flaws and never apologises. And now he thinks he decides everything in our friendship. If he wants to ignore me he will, and if I think that's not okay and call him he gets mad at ME because I'm annoying. Blames me, even tho he knows the ignoring drives me crazy and I told him thousands of times. He decides when we talk, how we talk, and if we can't talk I'm not allowed to say anything either otherwise I'm annoying. He calls me ugly, annoying, c\\*nt and stupid almost on a daily basis. And even called me fat one time even tho due to sickness I gained a lot of weight and he knows tI can't do anything about it rn. Yesterday he flipped out on me for no reason and I told him I needed an apology. He told me he would give one after I shut up. And instead of getting the hell out, IM ACTUALLY SHUTTING UP BECAUSE I WANT THAT APOLOGY SO BADLY AND I WANT THINGS TO BE OKAY :(.   \n\n\nThe worst part is, this is not even 25% of all the shit he has done. It has been crazy and when I'm typing this I ask myself why am I still in this friendship? But when I try to get out, I can't. I always get lured back in. The good memories suddenly are there 24/7. We talked everyday ALL DAY, hung out online almost everyday and saw eachother in reallife almost every month. I've blocked him for weeks but then when I get a message of him somewhere else I cave in and give another chance. Because I'm still hoping his good side will win from his bad side. But after 3 years I should know better right? I always say and think I'm done, but then apparantely I'm actually not yet. It's driving me crazy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo sorry for the long rant. I just needed to get it out.  \nDo any of you  maybe have tips to get out? To let go? To know you deserve better than this?\n\nAlso for everyone else going through this I'm SO sorry. I hope we all get out of this and will see that we deserve so much goddamn better :(", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Out of fear of my safety I was quietly waiting for him to leave on his own due to him buying his own house. When he randomly texted me that he was picking up his things I quickly packed everything and left it by the front door. I barricaded myself in my bedroom because I was afraid of him doing exactly what he did, destroying my house. Looking back it was probably idiotic of me to stay around and I should have just left and let him leave but I knew that if I wasn't there he might go above and beyond with damage and possibly not leave.\n\nHe tried to get in my locked bedroom. I refused to open the door and he told me he would kick it down. He tried. He kicked a hole right through the door but it never came down. He then went to my backyard and broke every pot and threw my railroad tie garden boxes onto the fresh lawn. Then he went into my garage and threw more stuff and turned off my sprinkler program (probably hoping I wouldn't notice and that he could ruin my lawn). He also went in the dryer and threw my clean clothes on the garage floor (WHO THE F DOES THIS, NEW LOW). Then he took my container of cleaning supplies and threw it, breaking many of the bottles, and spilling bleach all over my laminate flooring. \n\nHe then told me that he let my dog out so I did run out of my bedroom for that. He knew exactly what to say. Of course, the dog was still secure in her crate.... He never got to the dog... He then screamed in my face that I am an asshole piece of shit and \"fuck you\" at least 6 times. Then he called his dad in front of me and told him I am a piece of shit and that I treat him terribly and that he needs to move home.\n\nHe then demanded that I pack my car with his stuff and help him move. I refused. He asked me for the full list of gifts that he has gotten me over our relationship which included jewelry (engagement ring as well), hobby toys, cameras, and artwork. He took all of it. I didn't argue. Then he demanded that I pay him back the rent for the month. I said I would send him the balance after I fixed all of the damage that he did. He tried to grab my phone to Venmo himself, and I hid it in my pants and went into the fetal position. Eventually he left while screaming to never contact him again and to go fuck myself. I changed my door codes immediately and removed him from my alarm system. I locked every door and window. I called the non-emergency line and got an officer out immediately and took photos of everything. The officer was incredibly nice and supportive and arrived within 2 minutes....I am blown away at his kindness :( he sat and listened to me vent for over 1 hour and told me I don't need a loser like that... I was so embarrassed and I told him that I was afraid to tell my dad or friends. He told me to tell my dad, for safety purposes.\n\nI was afraid because I noticed that the Narc left a few items in my home. I knew that meant he would try to return or contact me.... 4 hours later he just showed up unannounced and picked them up. I was calm and collected, as I have been through the whole day (I am so proud for grey rocking). He asked me if I had anything to say and I said no. He again asked for the rent money and I said I would return it after I fixed the damages. He told me that he didn't give a shit about the door and that it wouldn't have happened if I had just opened the door... He also said that he would be suing me for the rent money, I said ok. He asked if he could hug me and I said no. He said I broke his heart and to treat the next guy better. He walked out. 2 minutes later he came back and asked me what the password was to the laptop (assuming he was STILL trying to get a reaction out of me). I told him the password and then he asked me if I was going to contact him, I said no, you told me not to. (LOL) He said have a nice life, don't do anything I wouldn't approve of.\n\nI blocked him on Venmo and went and got a burner phone (blocking doesn't really help when the Narc calls from a blocked number or another phone). I feel safer this way. I know I can block the number and I probably should but I prefer to have this pseudo phone for now. I should block him though so I don't see any messages when I turn the phone back on. \n\nI am literally mortified and reluctant to reach out to friends. I sat in my bed, numb, for the rest of the day/evening. I didn't really cry, I just sat there, wondering how the hell I got here...", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

They prefer to hang out with you, shmeepness, over me, I'm just included in the package.\" or \"I really am bad, aren't I?\" Frankly I'm unsure if he is being genuine but I do know he worried relentlessly over how he was perceived or how well-liked he was so I do know that on some level he is quite concerned with how people like him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the time since we broke up I let him know he was abusive to me and then I went mostly NC.

So on to the main point of this post- I have wanted to anonymously let him know this. To attempt to get to him and make him feel just as bad about himself as I feel he deserves given that he will never ever apologize to me or respond in a normal way to these revelations about himself. I want to hit him where it hurts and feed the insecurity he has about feeling like he belongs in our friend group.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this is a bad idea, but frankly I can't put into words why.

(I get that it may not be true love either direction, but it still feels like it is.) She helped me through my divorce, which was really ugly and public; and she helped me find and stick to a diet that helped me lose an enormous amount of weight...literally saved my life.\n\nI feel like with the relationship history we have (and the platonic friendship before the relationship) that she deserves more than a \"this isn't working for me\" vague breakup. I struggle with that because if I tell her she's a narcissist and is emotionally abusive, she'll literally come unglued. I don't want that, but I also kind of feel like that if I don't tell her, she won't be able to try to address those issues in her life.

Hows about you spiral into a panic attack and suddenly get thrown back into feeling anxiety and fear like you haven't felt in ages? Cool cool? Cool.\"\n\nDamns. Rude as hell. Luckily, I have an amazing therapist who has helped me learn to navigate those events. The PTSD is fairly new for me. I equate it to having a wound that needs the bandage removed for cleaning. Suddenly this ugly thing is exposed and more susceptible to infection. I've gotten to a place in therapy where the bandage is off and I'm looking at all the ugly. Oof. It's hard, but I feel like I'm heading the right direction.\n\nI did an interesting thing this morning. I wrote out what my usual day looks like now verses when I was with my narc ex. IT. WAS. INSANE. I've worked so hard to establish who I am, what I like, how I want to spend my time, who I want to spend time with. It was interesting (and difficult) to willingly take a walk down memory lane and remember what a normal day with him entailed. I have a hell of a time sleeping. It's easy to see why once I wrote all his \"rules\" regarding when/how I went to bed and woke up. It was pretty fucked up. It's interesting to look at the strategies I had in place just to survive a normal day. None of them are relevant now. I just get to live my life.\n\nBeing a full year removed from that abuse really brings the severity of my situation into focus. It scares me how close I was to completely losing myself. I shift between feeling angry, vengeful, cheated, to feeling euphoric, proud, peaceful, and happy. It's hard for me to not put him on blast and tell the entire world what a scumbag he is. It blows my mind that  because he didn't give me a black-eye, there's no accountability. It's not legal to hit me, but the rest of the torture gets a pass. What he did to me should not be legal.\n\nOverall, I am so proud that I jumped into the abyss with no plan and left that monster. I'll gladly take all the PTSD, all the work, all the self reflection, in exchange for living life on my own terms, surrounded by people who love me. And ACTUALLY love me.

My mom (50-something, who cares) was one of the meanest, most abusive people in my life. Still is. After a terrible dinner where she basically stormed off and sat in the car without eating because my brothers and I were giving her lip for being annoying, home girl tried to hit me when we got home. She was in the hallway, messing with the thermostat, as I was walking behind her. She turned around, started spewing curses at me and TRIED TO GRAB ME. By the back of my head. Her fingers got tangled in my hair and my shirt for just a moment before I ducked out of her way. You guys, I was shaking so hard. All I saw was red. I swear on my life I was going to end her right there and then. But I remembered my CBT sessions and walked away, calling her every single offensive name I could blurt out.  Meanwhile, she continued her insult-hurling, while also trying to throw things at me. My dad tried to protect me, and that wicked witch turned her attention onto him, trying to swing at him while cursing him out, too. Then, when she was done with us, she turned to my sister who had nothing to do with this, and insulted that poor girl until she was sobbing. The next day, I packed up my shit and left.\n\nI hate her. This was Saturday night, and I still can't stop thinking about it. The last time she tried to hit me was almost a year ago, and I almost got her back then, too.

I'm at work, and I've been fighting back tears for hours now. I can't stop thinking why, why me, why my family, why my wonderful father and my beautiful, amazing sister and my funny, sweet brothers? Why were we cursed with such a horrible mother? When I was a child, all I wanted was a safe refuge, away from her sharp nails and bitter, hateful words. This Saturday was the last straw.

{"post_id": "drprjy", "created_utc": 1572908054, "title": "Was I raped? (Triggers - rape/sexual/physical abuse)", "author": "gingerbeesnazzy", "self_text": "Hey all,\n\nSorry this will be a long one, I have been going to therapy for the past six months (roughly) for surviving a physically abusive relationship where I was hospitalized twice at the end of it (Let's call him A) and then getting out of an even more recent relationship with a guy who was constantly lying and cheating on me (let's call him P). I am in a very healthy relationship with a great man (Z), so I've been trying to change up my unhealthy habits to be able to make better decisions when I am sad/anxious/etc. and to recognize my actions in order to change and be safe. After speaking with my therapist for these months, I had a breakthrough that had to deal with acknowledging my history with P. I've been living in Nashville, TN since 2016 and first moving here (which the reason I moved here was to escape A as he was harassing me to know end and I had to move from Cali), I met P through a mutual friend right after the leaving A and accepting the incidents and abuse he put on me the last 4 years of our 6 year relationship. P seemed fun, was nice and we got along well and was just so charming and sweet. He knew what happened to me from our mutual friend, and was supportive if it was ever brought up. But, when telling my friend that I thought he was sweet, she warned me that he once kicked a girl when she was already down when he was blackout drunk and told me to be careful (wish I listened).\n\nA couple months later, my friend who I moved in with left to go back home to New Jersey and left so last minute, she cut the lease without telling me and I had nowhere to go. P said I could stay with him and his roommates, so I did. Living there was fun at first, but it soon began taking a toll on my health. I have epilepsy, so if I do not get enough sleep, am stressed, dehydrated, I can have a seizure and this new place was just a loud, party house at the time. I was still so stressed from my recent relationship and scared, that moving in with other people besides P and the roommates, was extremely daunting at the time. New things scared me, and P's actions began to feel familiar. Drunk more than he was sober, mean to me when he was drunk, never listened when I complained about the volume, just basically disregarded everything I would say. It was like being with A again, but I told myself, no it isn't, and that he is just a party guy and I was lame. And when P became blackout drunk, he would be sexually aggressive and it usually led me to just do what he wanted because he would be pushy, I had nowhere to go and thought he would kick me out if I didn't do what he wanted, and was just genuinely scared I would be like that other girl (he told me that she was trying to hit him and his sister and was just defending them), so I just let him do whatever.\n\nIn one instance specifically though (which was the recent discovery at therapy), he had friends over hanging out and being loud in the living room. I was in the kitchen cleaning when drunk P stumbles in, grabs my head, shoves it down and puts himself in my mouth. I remember crying, but not saying or doing anything for fear of being homeless, fear of getting hurt, and fear of being judged by the people there (this was right after my abusive relationship, so at that time, I was afraid of everything and justified it). But, I never stopped him. I knew I didn't want it but I didn't say or do anything until he finished. Then he just went to hanging out with his friends.\n\nAnd since I was so messed up, I tried justifying it. \"He really thinks I'm sexy or he could wait,\" \"he was drunk and he didn't know\", all those stupid lines. But the worst thing was, I was so low, that I tried to get that relationship to turn into something serious (wtf right?). He proceeded to cheat on me at least 8 times, but was always apologetic and drunk when he did it. I knew I was always being lied to and even knew I did not want to be with this guy, but still stayed (my therapist says it was because I was clinging on to the familiar I had with A and I just fell back into the same cycle). But the instance that happened when his friends were over, my therapist says was rape, but I feel like if I just did something then, it wouldn't have happened, but I was so scared and weak, I let it, so it was partially my fault. And even moreso since I continued to try and make it work.\n\nSo basically, I don't know what that night was. Clearly, I was never happy with him and never wanted to be with him and thought he was awful, but I never stopped him. I do believe if I said something or fought back he wouldn't have done anything, but I never did. I'm still trying to accept that I cannot justify his actions and that he did take advantage of my kindness, but I didn't do anything. On top of that, we have mutual friends, and I honestly think that if i told one of them, they wouldn't believe me because I stayed with him. What should I do (besides keep going to therapy) and is this even rape?\n\nSorry about this being all long, but I needed some support from others who may know this situation.

And...after a week of anxiously waiting, worrying, and crying, i got the news that the judge granted my order!!! i have never been more happy, the police know who he is, if he comes around all i have to do is call them and he will go to JAIL. no more mind games, no more  thinking he is above the law. I have never been more relieved and happy to move on with my life. It feels like a weight has been lifted. I still have a ton of therapy and trauma to get through. but at least i no longer have to live in fear he can contact me without any consequences. I DID IT.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I couldn't get a restraining order against him. I tried. I still can't. The cops don't believe me even when I have video of him on my street. He's made websites about me. He maintains a Twitter account letting me know he's watching me. This is a new Reddit account because I just realized all the creepy messages I've been getting for months were from him. I found out through the Twitter account.\n\nThe man has a history of domestic violence, animal abuse, DUIs, property damage, theft, and other random things. He's in my head. Like, I'll meet somebody new walking my dog and I'll bring him up. I'll ask my neighbors if he's tried to talk to them. I'm constantly worried about what he's posting online about me. He tells people I'm obsessed with him. If I do or say anything to defend myself, he publicly twists it and says I'm drunk and crazy. The woman who had him arrested for pushing her and kicking her dog actually teams up with him to harass me.\n\nI don't know what to do. He's destroying my life. I've failed at returning to school twice. I'm self-isolating. A lawyer couldn't even get a restraining order for me. My reputation is ruined. He's very good at turning people against me and I've lost many friends. He's contacted my boyfriend multiple times attempting to get him to leave me. He'll say I'm cheating with my ex and his \"Proof\" is making Facebook and Google hangout accounts under my name and my ex's name and talking between them. When I took him to court he used altered PayPal receipts as alibis and brought the woman he beats to defend him.\n\nI can't win and now when I'm Googled, his websites, blogs and Twitter accounts about me come up on the front page with my face in the images.\n\nI'm sure he's incredibly happy I deleted my last Reddit account because it's how he feels he can control me.  He wants to know he instills fear in me. He even sent me an email saying he's putting pressure on me and causing me emotional distress and then he started. The judge didn't care about the email. If I take him to court again, he's going to try and get me in trouble for perjury because the judge believed his PayPal receipts and now it looks like I lied to police and the judge. He even had the judge convinced I owed him money.\n\nUnfortunately, I ended up in the same town as him. He wasn't settled here. He was just hopping around the country and getting arrested here due to abusing that woman. My boyfriend got a job here and I definitely didn't want to come but I love my boyfriend and did. My abuser then settled here and said I'm in love with him and desperate for his help and when he rejected me, I spread lies about him. All just to discredit anything I say. All I did was tell people he's a dangerous drunk who abuses people. That's true. It really got bad when I let a woman know that he's passing around nude photos of her. I really just don't know how to handle this anymore.\n\nAnd this guy is actually obsessed with me. He sent me nudes of himself. I shouldn't have deleted them, but I didn't realize he'd keep going this long.\n\nEdit: I do have a therapist, which is nice relief once per week. I tried medications, but my body just doesn't like med. I've been trying for almost a decade. I do try to workout but it gets so bad, I can't think or move.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

This is what happened...\n\nmy bf covered a shift today (and tomorrow) at a different location. He was a bit eh about it cause one of his co workers (whom he only trained for a few hours ONCE before) made him feel uneasy with a comment she made about...saying one of the words that triggers his anxiety \"personality disorder/bi-polar/schizo\" (its one of those three i'm not sure what one she specifically used) when he hears those words he gets very anxious and thinks people are talking about him and has anxiety attacks. So he was working with her today...and as well as tomorrow. We talked about it and I was there for him.\n\nHe has a good work day with her. he called me at the end of the day and started telling me, work was great that she was so funny, she had him dying laughing all day. I said oh yea? thats awesome, much better then you thought\" and he was like yes. And he started to tell me all the stuff they talk about. He said she was telling him about her relationship with her bf and how is resembled ours. All he did was smoke and play video games and jerk off all day. ( yes our relationship was exactly  like this for a while, it was until I told him to leave a few days ago. not smoking because he quit 25 days ago...but a lot with video games and porn still.) He was like its weird because he will ask her to do the same stuff for him as I did to you, get me a drink...even though he doesn't do anything all day...or throw this out....when I am right by the garbage.or that they dont have sex anymore..he said he felt a little weird about that comment.  and then they started talking about me....idk call me weird...but for someone that doesn't know someone I think all this stuff is a little much for conversation the second day you work with someone.....\n\nBack story. Im a retired vet. I was in a bad MVA which ended my career. I am blind in one eye from a head injury..but my actual eye is healthy and fine...just cant see. out of it. I have really bad migraines...I have to go for injections every 3 months, shoulder/ankle/neck/back injuries as well. Im 100% compensated.....I served for 5 years. when I got out I went to school and met him...graduated with a certificate...then my kid needed medical help..I took some time off of finding a job to help her...a year later im back in school to get a degree...the ONLY job I had was a few months at a retail store until I had surgery this august...I can go back this month. So barely a job. No excuse, because I do need a job to be productive but I do get paid and paid to go to school.\n\nanyway she was talking about how her bf thinks if shes going to cook dinner after 12 hour shift he's crazy. and he started laughing. My bf and her talked about what I do...which is no job student..and sometimes I cook...and she was joking around about it...saying oh if I didn't cook I'd be single (my bf then said its because shes overweight and unattractive) and she asked if I ever had a job and he said yea the military and she was laughing and said how long and he told her and she was like OHHHHHH thats it? and they were laughing about me (not. because im this or that) but he has stood up for me for WAY less. Once a person said they didn't like my name and he said \"I'd rather have my gf have that name, then sound like you\" Just extremely over protective...and im not going to lie it upset me and it was so cringy because they were laughing at me. . And I said I didn't like that and started to explain why..he got really annoyed really quickly and said I was just being friendly and having a fun time talking to my co worker and I tell you and you ruin it, you cant take a joke, it wasn't mean..I told him what I DID in the military was actually pretty dangerous...way more then checking in patients and  taking vitals as my job. he got annoyed and said she wasn't joking around about the military...and I said she was joking about me....did you tell her this this and this,,,or that youre incredibly lazy...and he was getting mad and was like...this is why I cant share stuff about my day with you, youre so emotional..you love me so much that youre so afraid someone is going to take me away from you. I said thats not it, he says it it. I told him I wanted space...he said fine. then I texted him literally 2 minutes after...and was like you've stood up for me for way less...and he blocked me.....then he called me saying I said I didn't want to talk to him anymore..which I DID NOT say..I said space...but he was like..yes you did, yes you did...so I agreed I did even though I didn't....and he told me  he doesn't want to talk about the relationship I tell you all the time to be chill but you cant...and I said...not when this happens cause it upset me...and he was like im annoyed with you cause I said not to talk about it...but you just dont get it. and I ruined his night because..I started a fight..and I just feel way more fucked up then usual. and I dont know why...this out of everything. I need to change my behavior if I want to be with him....but this is allowed?\n\nEDIT: Oh and also...we were planning to move out of state this month. he put in his 2 weeks...and he was going to put some of his money from his last check to a CC bill thats used for stuff we both do. going out, food, anything we want..\\*I have NEVER taken his card and charged stuff... and his bill is pretty high. Our deal is now...I pay for the rent and utilities. Internet and food (he pays for groceries a lot, as well as ordering out a lot too) he pays his car and his personal bills and uses his credit card for everything we do,im pretty much left with nothing after the bills. he likes when I put down large sums for my loan..I think its a great idea too...but im left with nothing ..I think it should be half and half. but he says...he can just go live at his moms for free, he hates this apartment why would he pay for it...so anyway...thats our arrangement...when we'd get a house...we'd split everything down the middle. .we were going to depend on my salary this month....I already paid our phones, and the the car from stuff from him I said I would cover until he got another job. we already started going through the rough patch at this point of me paying..but I know bills need to be paid and I would never leave him hanging and not help him at all. but now he wants a large amount of money for his CC, we already agreed upon the amount.....but he doesn't know if he wants to be with me. he keeps asking everyday...but my answer is...ill pay the minimum amount..but im not giving you what you want until you know what you want, he doesn't think thats fair...I do....I just am so lost but I know its \"our\" debt...but...I have my own bills too...and if were not together...the only reason im paying half...is if we move together and he stops working....so am I wrong?\n\nedit: spelling corrections", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

They didn\u2019t indulge him, in bad behavior, either; he was expected to behave himself, and he definitely learned how to function like a civilized human person. He fooled me, for a very long time, into believing that he really was a civilized human person. Then came a devaluation phase in which he abused and gaslit me, then he discarded me, and, a few years later, here I am.\n\nThe only clue I have is that my ex-in-laws fed into my nex\u2019s sense of specialness. He was a gifted child, and my in-laws would say that they \u201cdidn\u2019t know where he got it\u201d - even though it\u2019s obvious where he got it, because both of them are highly intelligent, well-educated people. They would say that he \u201cwas never really a child\u201d because he had mature interests: they talked about trying to entertain him with age-appropriate \u201ckid stuff\u201d, but he read non-fiction from an early age, and was more interested in doing that than playing outside. They would say that he \u201cnever had peers\u201d, because he was So Much Smarter than the other kids. \n\nOddly, his younger sibling is clearly just as smart as he is, and has truly unique accomplishments, but they don\u2019t talk about him in the same awe-struck terms. They clearly love him very much, but he\u2019s the \u201cnormal\u201d one, because he was a kid who acted like a kid. Indeed, Younger Sibling always seemed much more socially normal to me. In spite of missing a lot of school while recovering from an accident, he always had, and continues to have, a lot of friends. \n\nI also got the gifted label as a kid. I also read well above grade-level. But I also liked to play outside with the other kids.  My parents - also highly intelligent, well-educated people - checked me when I was being arrogant, made sure I knew that success in life depended more on my ability to get along with others, and emphasized the importance of compassion for other people. \n\nIs that the difference between me and my nex?

Now everything in life tastes a little less sweet. \n\nI don\u2019t want to miss my nex. I don\u2019t want to long for someone who hurt me so astronomically badly. I don\u2019t want to want someone who doesn\u2019t want me. \n\nIt\u2019s been a TOUGH couple of weeks to put it mildly. Last  Monday I fucked up and ruined a my relationship with this really great person I had been seeing because I astronomically overreacted to something that triggered me and proceeded to appear like a complete psycho over something most people would have brushed off. I\u2019m pretty torn up about it but it also seemed to trigger me back into obsessive thinking about my nex.  Then my nex\u2019s birthday was on Friday and I knew they were spending it with the (allegedly abusive) person they left me to go back to and you know how that goes. I just ruined it with my lover and am thinking about my nex having birthday sex with SWIM. The same week I also received some life altering and devastating news about something that I thought was resolved but turns out it will likely render me unemployable and penniless. \n\nSo I tried to reach out. I have no idea if they got my messages or not. I\u2019ve been looking at pictures and videos and I see the light and love in my eyes and realized that\u2019s gone now. I always joked that my nex gave me grey hairs, only it wasn\u2019t really a joke. That relationship aged me, tarnished my soul. \n\nAt first it breathed life into me, i felt more alive and more in love, safer than I ever had. For the first time in my life i was home. I know I\u2019m not the only one who felt this way with their nex. Why, after all, would any sane person put up with so much mistreatment and stay so long with someone who is hurting them?

That only toxic love can make you feel those highs and they are manufactured. Genuine love is calm, rational, stable. I **want** to actually believe that, but the truth is I\u2019ve had love like that and it was meh. I don\u2019t want that. I want the all consuming love that is so big you feel like you heart might explode every time you see your person. Why do I have to tell myself it\u2019s a lie? I never really believed in that kind of love until I felt it and now I don\u2019t want any less, is that wrong? \n\nI hate my nex for leaving me, for lying to me, for cheating on me. I hate myself for acting like a psycho and sending a motion progressively crazier messages. I hate myself for not playing the game better. Buy more than anything, so much more than anything else I hate my nex for doing the cruelest thing anyone had ever done to me and so much crueler than anything I could have dreamed: they showed me what **could** be and then took it away and I don\u2019t know how to ever get over that.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

{"post_id": "druqew", "created_utc": 1572931453, "title": "Escaping the Narcissist", "author": "Getbetter4u", "self_text": "I recently ended a relationship with a narcissist. I saw his personality disorder when I first started dating him but I wanted to make him feel better, more secure. It was a classic case scenario of a relationship with a narcissist. \n\nThis narcissist exploited me in ways where he would tell his coworkers, friends, and family that I was malicious. He would go into tantrums and he has thrown a luggage at me, screamed, and denied me of communication in being understood. Narcissists usually take on relationships where they are in control of the other person. They can be extremely jealous, in fact this was the first red flag. I thought that if he couldn't trust me, it must be because he couldn't trust himself and so eventually the mistrust was also turned towards him from me. There were many times I tried to get out of the relationship but he continued to express that he could be better and that he loved me too much to let me go. When there were disagreements over the phone, instead of talking, he would immediately hang up the phone. It became so consistent that i didnt even think anything of it anymore. He would hang up and either I'd call him back or he would call me back begging to reason and talk again.\n\nTimes when I attempted to break up, he admitted himself to the mental hospital. Either that or he would tell his job hes having an anxiety attack and go see a psychiatrist. Then he would call me and tell me hes better and want to get back with me. I would give him the benefit of the doubt but I always knew better.\n\nI am not innocent. I think that in relationships we all play a role. I played the role of the enabler. I enabled his bad behavior even though I did call him out. I fell for his grand gestures! I went back to him. I gave him all the attention I believed he wanted and more!\n\nHe would even ask that in the bedroom, I tie him up and would suggest femdom type of play. I didnt mind. I tried it with him many times and he would say he loved it and would reminisce, telling me what he loved most. Then during arguements he would tell me I was malicious and I enjoyed hurting people. Yet, I never touched him or did anything to him that he didnt ask for. \n\nAs time went by, he became more and more abusive. He would call me names. He would accuse me of cheating, saying I'm talking to some other man and that he hoped we would be happy together. We went on our first vacation on a cruise and he went to sleep early every evening and got 10-12 hours of sleep every night. He barely paid attention to me and when I asked if we could go to dinner he would tell me that I can go by myself. I tried to watch a romantic movie called The Vow and he screamed at me saying that movies like that make people want to kill themselves and that I need to turn it off. So I did. \n\nHe loved attention though! In fact, if he was ever called out, and he was! He was the kind of person that loved the lime light -- he was quick witted, he could make anyone flabbergasted and pull a rug right from underneath them with his words. He took pride in it. He knew how to swoon my friends that he felt were important in my life. He would bask in glory if someone paid him a compliment or if other women even paid him any mind. In fact he would repeat it and tell the story to many people. \n\nIt's now been 5.5 months of us dating. I've tried countless of times to break up with him but he would always do or say something to somehow change my mind. I always want to give him the benefit of the doubt. Today we broke up again  and we just got home from our trip from California. He kept on asking that I put him on social media and post things of us. I finally did this time and he went ahead and deleted me from everything. \n\nWhile on our vacation he neglected me and kept saying he had jet lag. I told him I was falling out of love and he threw a luggage at me and told me I made him feel crazy and like he wanted to kill himself. He would scream and yell and not let me get a word in. When I told him I want to talk, he would say I've let you talk enough even though I talked for 2 minutes and he had been screaming for 10 to 15 minutes. There were good moments in our trip and I had some favorite moments together. When I asked him what his favorite moment was, he said it was watching wildfires burn. Wow was I appalled. I mean #1 that he said that was his favorite part, watching it burn and #2 that it didnt have anything to do with us spending time together. \n\nI hope this is the end of our relationship. I know it's best for me to move on but when there are feelings involved it makes it so complicated. I never wanted to hurt him but when I first attempted to break up with him I told him everything I thought of him when he kept trying to get back with me. He often blames me for his behavior. I know what the right thing to do is. In fact I'm so surprised he was able to keep relationships for 8 and 4 years. \n\nAnyways, I dont need criticism I know that I've gotten myself in this situation but I just need to be strong. So long as he doesnt contact me it makes things 100% easier. I need to be strong whether or not he decides to contact me. Words of wisdom and encouragement would be great at this time. After all I still care and love him and I know the break up may be hard for him unless of course he already has someone else to replace me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

So I really have no idea what I'm doing...\n\nAnyway I think my husband maybe a bit narcassictic... there's definitely been psychological and emotional abuse in our relationship and some moments of physical aggression. But it's a long and complex story and I don't know how to start unweaving this web. We're seperated currently but I'm on the verge of either reconciling or ending completely and I just feel so confused.\n\nMy husband and i are only young at 25 but we've been together for 11 years now, married 4 and have 2 children. We were high school sweet hearts but we pretty much started trauma bonding from the get go. I come from an abusive and narcassictic home and early in our relationship I had a major trauma occur outside of the home that lead to a 2 year court battle and just pure hell on earth... but I mention it because that's where we started off. He supported me through all that. At 15, in the midst of everything, I moved in with him and his family and we've been living together ever since. At 17 we moved far away from my home state and at 18 we had our first baby together which was yet another complicated and traumatic experience. We got married at 21 and we had our second last year... \n\nI guess there has always been red flags. He was angry and overly jealous that I hadn't lost my virginity to him. He wouldn't let me wear or do certain things. As teenagers he would tighten any make up I ever bought so much that I couldn't open them again because he didn't want me wearing it... but these were minor things compared to what I'd grown up with. So minor they only registered as \"proof of love\". When we had our first he became a real arsehole. He was depressed for the first year and didn't really participate. He acted angry and resentful towards me but when I asked him if he wanted to leave he never would. Lots of retreating behaviour during this time, sulking and tantrums. But we were young and having kids is hard and unexpected and wasn't that normal? He improved. We improved. He got worse. He started having angry outbursts and getting angry at our then 1yr old for having tantrums or being upset or sick or whatever. I put my foot down. He rained it in and got \"better\" again. We got married and that's when the lines got really blurry. He got a credit card and blew a bunch of money after the wedding without talking to me at all. He spent all our savings. He didn't help around the house but critised my up keep.we moved and things were worse in the new house. And when I say worse though I don't mean in your face bad... I type it out and yeah... he's an arsehole... but at the same time he was never \"mean\" to me and every time I stumbled back into a bout of depression he pulled me back out... He wasn't great but he wasn't horrible. \n\n3 years ago is when i thought things became abusive. He started having episodic behaviour and we had instances of just plain violence and aggression (he threw a glass vase at me one night while screaming and hollering and used the broken glass to stab at my security screen when I got him outside. Another day I came home and and as soon as you opened the door there were BROKEN knives everywhere as he had been throwing them at the door... he's got in my face and screamed at me to hit him.... He started locking me out of our house for various reasons, mainly when I'd upset him, I went out one night with work colleagues and when I returned home past midnight he had locked me out for being \"late\"...) And controlling (I don't drive and we don't live in the most public transport or walking friendly place, He started making leaving really difficult OR he would just leave me places knowing I couldn't get home OR he would use the car to display his anger at me by driving dangerously. After another spending spree and our joint accounts were in tatters he arranged the finances so they were only in his name and eventually he stopped leaving me with a card to access funds at all, when i did have a bank card 80% of the time I would find out at the checkout there was no money in there and I'd have to call him and wait for him to give me some... for groceries... on top of this he was spending all the money anyway on nonsense and racking up thousands (like... 30,000+) of debt. He hacked all my social media and messaging/emailing accounts and even messaged people as me as well as harrassing friends through his own accounts and uktimating deleting all my contacts outside of immediate family... When I tried to work he would make me late, make me wait 30+ minutes after work to get picked up or just sabotaged me coming in at all. When I tried to get my licence he wasn't supportive and made it out as if he couldn't help me even if he wanted to.. When I tried to study he wasn't supportive again and I dropped it.) And just plain mean behaviour (he's never put me down so to speak... but his expectations got bigger and bigger and the more depressed I became the less capable I was... on new years day 4 months after our second he gave me a 3 page letter detailing all my \"flaws\". I wish it was just a list of name calling or something but it was a lovely detailed list about the most personal things he could think of written very diplomatically... He knew I was already diagnosed with post natal depression at this point, it was just a list about how I couldn't keep up with the up keep of my body/the kids/the house/him, how much of a (literally) disgusting failure he thought I was under the guise that he was leaving. As soon as I read the list tho he wouldn't leave and refused even tho he had packed his bags and everything. He never complements me. I could count on both hands the amount of times he's told me I'm beautiful in ten years. He never sees anything I do. He constantly corrects me? To the point that one day he told me I was making a drink of cordial wrong... but he does that in a \"oh here let me *help* you way\"? It's very confusing. Other then that letter I didn't feel particularly put down... but I also constantly felt not good enough, guilty and like I had to modify my behaviour because I knew it wasn't pleasing him? He never called me fat. But I knew he fetishiced much smaller women then me. He never said I was a bad mother before but he constantly undermined me. He didn't call me stupid but he ignored me when I spoke and acted as if I couldn't do simple tasks). Mainly this happened in episodes, other then the general financial control and manipulative behaviour (tantrums/cold shoulders) and at first we got him help and he was diagnosed with cyclothymia, a similar disorder to bipolar. Eventually we found a medication combination that helped and the more aggressive episodes kind of stopped but I did get a DVO after the glass and knives incidents (just a good behaviour one at the time). But that's when the behaviour like the letter started and the financial dependence ramped up and the isolation increased... after the letter I made him attend a DV group but he only did the preliminary meetings and never went to the actual group... claiming he was better and it was starting to interfere with our lives... And things were kind of okay. Until I woke up and he had thrown all the clothes I own, including my intimates and everything, into our back yard in the rain ready for the scheduled maintenance workers to see bright and early at 8am 3 months later... the last time he had done that it was across our front lawn for the neighbours to see.. he'd also filled the sink with all my tobacco products and random other broken things of mine and water... And that's when I told him to leave and find somewhere else to live. He refused at first and then pretended he wasn't going to leave while he searched for a new place and then left suddenly one day making sure we were behind rent and without things when he did... but he also left promising to work on himself and get better and to come back to the family healthy... it was a confusing time. He said he left us behind and struggling because he needed the money to leave and I wanted him to leave and he was leaving to get better so it was okay. But that's just an example of how he twists what appear to be obviously bad actions into reasonable things. \n\nAnyway that was  almost 4 months ago now. As I said, when he left it was under promises that he would change... And like an idiot I spent the first few weeks trying to rekindle and reconnect and fix. But he quickly went back into his old ways and this time with the distance I just let him slide into his isolation instead of trying to appease him. So we went 2 - 3 months without any real interaction beyond the kids and certainly with no attempts at reconciliation. I've slowly been starting to feel like \"me\" again through this time..  And I was beginning to accept the what if of a future apart... And to help that I made the mistake of catching up with a friend, a male friend, while he had the kids a few weekends ago..\n\nApparently he had spotted some messages over my should the week before and had decided this week to \"catch me out\" so he bought the kids home early (he had left with them at 6:30pm the night before and returned without warning at 9am the next day....). He was not happy at all that we were having coffee... He made my friend leave and then stayed around for 3 hours to \"talk\".\n\nNow the issue is ever since then he has been RELENTLESS and I feel more twisted then a pretzel... I think the term is love bombing? He's making all these promises. Doing all these nice things. Messaging me constantly and trying to spend as much time around me as humanly possible (he's spending upwards of 8 hours here a day on the weekend \"for the kids\"). And the other night after not sleeping for 2 days and having him here all day again trying to be \"sweet\" while also questioning me ALL DAY about \"who I'm seeing\" and how much it's \"breaking his heart that I could be\" I caved... like the weakling I've proved to be... I caved yet again... we had sex and he made me agree to stop talking with anyone else again... And to be honest I just don't know what I want now. When I write this all down i know... I see the pattern... I see the harm... I see the toxicity... so why when I'm with him do I fucking MELT and turn into mouldable putty?! He makes me feel like it's possible... that he could be the man I thought he was... And then I feel guilty for not making that process as easy for him as possible because I feel like I've fucked up his life or something... maybe I'm just the reason he became this person? And he says unless he's 100% sure I'm still \"his\" (so to speak) he says he can't start the process... I want to tell him I want to slow down. That I'm not ready for any type of commitment at the moment and that I need time to heal but that id like to get to know the person he chooses to become in that process.. but I don't want to make any promises, choices, commitments or such at this time. I feel like that's unreasonable and I'm asking to have my cake and eat it too... but I'm not trying to. I don't want to play around... I've just realised how isolated I was and how little I know of the world as it is today... And I wanna be able to just be for a time without basing my actions on someone else's feelings and thoughts.... is that unreasonable? \n\nI don't know what I'm searching for here... I feel like this man saved me at one point in my life and like I'm only the woman I am today because of him.....And I envisioned us spending a life time and growing old together... whether i should or not i love this man... and i dont know how to let that go or if im supposed to or what that even means... can't I just sit with this and give him the opportunity to change while not having to make a \"choice\"? If I do what he asks and close myself off again and focus on him I know I'll just end up with tunnel vision but I don't know how to ask for what I need without cutting him off entirely.. and I don't know how to do that now I've \"given in\" to him? Aren't I just being a bitch? Aren't I stringing him a long? Worse... am i just out being a slut...? I don't know... \n\nTl:Dr I seperated from my abusive husband who ive been with 11 years with the intention of reconciling but then his behaviour continued and we were 100% seperated so I went on a kind of \"date\" and he found out and is now relentlessly pursuing me again and I don't know what to do....", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Suddenly I didn't care about making the relationship work anymore. I didn't care about his wellbeing. It was over for me. \n\nI felt good about this reaction because it meant I didn't miss him at all. (In my mind all I can think is, what was there to miss? There was nothing, this was a nothing relationship.) Once I had the information to logically understand what was going on, and once it made sense to me, it was almost like there was no reason for me to continue trying, because I understood that his brain didn't function like a normal human being. \n\nHowever, I'm not sure this reaction is the most healthy. Because ever since our final break up, I have felt little to nothing. It's like I shut down indefinitely. I feel miserable all the time, but I'm not wallowing in sadness over a specific thing. It's more just numbness. It's even hard to feel good emotions when they come. I know they're there, but they're dull. It's like my heart is a house, and the emotions are knocking at the door. I know they're outside wanting to get in, but I can't open the door. \n\nCan anyone relate?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I stayed quiet for a few years, but my parents eventually found out when I was seeing a psychiatrist. I won't go into the full story here, but I was also sexually assaulted by a man when I was 15. I thought at that time and for many years, that they at least talked to my brother about what he did. Only did I find out a year ago that they never confronted my brother for his actions towards me. I was stunned. My mom wanted to say something and now regrets that she didn't, but my father insisted at the time that they didn't need to bring it up because my brother was not living at home anymore (he was away at college). My father doesn't even remember hearing that I was sexually abused. He claims to forget everything. He has had an addiction to prescription pain medicine for decades which has made him very erratic, and I guess that accounts for some of it. However, it really hurts that he doesn't remember. My father was emotionally, psychologically, and sometimes physically abusive to my mother, and I sometimes wonder if my brother learned some of his behavior from him.\n\nSo after I found out that my brother was never confronted for sexually abusing me, I decided to write him a letter. I gave it a lot of thought. I told him what he did and how it has affected me. I wasn't mean or say I was going to tell anyone. My brother replied with a vicious letter telling me that I am crazy and have been screwed up since I was a child. He told me I wasn't capable of writing the letter that I sent and that someone was helping me. I did very well in school, but I guess he has always viewed me as \"stupid\" since I am very shy and had a speech impediment when I was a young kid. He told me I am a loser since I am currently not working and have to live at home. I am on disability by the way for Depression, OCD, Anorexia, Anxiety, CPTSD, Migraines, and Seizures. He said I am a danger to society and he is the victim. The whole letter was abusive gas-lighting. I wasn't stunned at his response because he has always been very cruel to me, and in fact I experienced significant emotional abuse from him growing up. My mother knew I was writing the letter because I told her, but my brother forwarded the e-mail to her anyways because he said he wanted to show her how crazy I was. I thought she would at least tell him that he shouldn't be talking to me the way he is, but she didn't. It devastates me that she didn't defend me. We're grown, but after doing nothing when I was younger, I would have thought she would do the right thing now. She has assured me she believes me and supports me, but also that it's too difficult and she is caught in the middle. Even though she knows my brother is a bad person, she won't turn her back on him because he is her child too. I understand that to an extent, but it is just so devastating that I don't have the firm backup of my parents in regards to this. I feel so alone.\n\nMeanwhile, it just eats me up that my brother has had a good life and got away with everything. I tried to put everything from my childhood behind me, got two degrees, etc, but I broke-down trying to work. I am trying to figure things out and turn my life around, but I don't know how I can make peace with the fact that my brother never faced consequences, least of all words from my parents. It's so not fair. I am in therapy and have been for years. I refuse to speak to my brother or see him ever again. I know this has made things very uncomfortable for my mother. It's like everything is my fault. I have no friends and am so alone in life. I thought I was going to have a great life with a good job and wonderful family, but at 35, it isn't looking too likely.

He's 45, I've never had much to do with this side of the family. He's my mom's baby brother. He gets snappy over little things, 2nd guesses me and that causes me to make nervous mistakes which fuels his temper even more which just becomes a vicious cycle. Clenched fist raised, talks through his teeth, \"boy if you don't yada yada I'm gonna...\" The typical boomer/gen x machismo tune.  I was raised with an abusive stepfather that used marijuana as his excuse and copout in life. I have lots of triggers because of it. Everything from verbal and emotional abuse all the way to physical abuse. I'm starting to see more similarities between my uncle and him. I mean, at least my uncle works and isn't a deadbeat is what I keep telling myself. I know my grandfather was hard on him and my mom too. But something has to give. I don't do well with having buttons pushed or being screamed at, especially over trivial things. I wonder exactly how damaged I really am. The gruff, over confident abusers in my life have always treated physical violence as if that is the end all be all. They mistake patience for weakness and caution for timidness. I'm a pretty peaceful person I guess, but I feel like I'll snap soon and in the process ruin relationships. I have my own temper as well, but I'm more controlled and depending on how far I feel I have to go to get my point across, more dangerous or just easier to take out of context. Where they threaten to \"beat my ass\", when I'm being screamed at by a tyrant my mind skips ass whoopin and heads straight into more horrible territories. Is this normal? And how do any of you cope? While I'm being interrogated about some tools he lost or a part he misplaced my blood begins to boil and I find that becoming more terrifying than anything he can offer is all he'll understand. Where do I go from here? I love this job and I do owe my uncle for helping me change careers. I don't really have any other family either. But I can't deal with that pseudo macho abusive bullshit without feeling the urge to show the person in question who the actual alpha in the room is. So I just nod and do whatever I'm supposed to, which leads them to believe I'm softer than I actually am. That's really the only other thing I've known to do that works other than put pure fear into them. But that will follow you. I know that will only make it worse. We all know a wounded abusive personality comes back infinitely worse after being put in their place, not to mention how you'll be perceived as a nutcase forever afterwards. I just don't get it, though. I'm pretty much fine, aside from my triggers. My brother is fried, my uncle is fried, my cousins are fried and my stepdad as well. They all smoke weed several times a day though. They're such assholes you'd never know they smoked. My brother wasn't always like this. Can these kinds of people not be dealt or reasoned with in a peaceful way? I often feel that the \"just walk away\" treatment only allows them to keep being the way they are, while at the same time I think they are too selfish and stubborn to learn from anything I could even do to them. I'm sick of the eggshells but I don't want to be abusive myself even if it is turning a key compared to their snapping. \nAny thoughts or advice would be welcome.

He just left.. another 3 hour time suck. \n\nHe came in and we chatted about what we\u2019ve been up to, which was nice. I liked hearing about his life because I still do have feelings for him. But, of course, he quickly started talking about our relationship and trying to work things out again. How he wanted me as his wife and to have a home together. How al he ever wanted was to be a perfect husband and father while I was pregnant. I was like ok.. words don\u2019t match actions there. But kept it to myself. I did not give him any indication I THOUGHT of us trying to work things out. I routinely steered the conversation away from us together. \n\nI went to use the bathroom and heated up some tea. He followed me into the kitchen and hugged me, said he wanted to kiss me, grabbed my ass. Kept saying I miss you. I love you. I hugged him back, I guess I could have pushed him off or something. Tried harder. \n\nWe went back to the couch and he was smiling at me, I was nervous laughing. He was touching my leg. Kept talking about how he wanted to have sex. And how good I look. He asked what I was thinking and I said I was thinking of the ramifications of if we did have sex. He was eyeing me up and I asked him what if we did something no strings attached. I am still super attracted to him and horny. I fucked up. \n\nHe pounced on me and kissed me, we made out for a few minutes. I could tell he wanted to have sex but I did not want to do that and muddy the waters more. He kept saying how he wanted to have sex, but I wouldn\u2019t bite. He started kissing my neck and breasts above my shirt, but I was very restrained. I did not touch him at all. \n\nHe goes back into talking about our relationship, and I reiterate how I feel like some of what we\u2019d have to get through feels insurmountable to me, but I\u2019m not saying nothing could happen in the future. He said why would it even be hard for me, HED be the one having to do all the fixing with my parents and getting over what I\u2019ve done to him. I explained why I broke up with him and he minimized that. Saying well what\u2019s done is done sorry. As if I could ever have that attitude with him. \n\nHe sees that I\u2019m not acquiescing to him about getting back together and is put out. Gets sullen, tells me I\u2019m playing mind games and screwing with him pulling him in all directions. I said well you kissed me.. you came here and started talking about this. He then said well o wanted to talk to you about [specific private thing] or else I would\u2019ve just asked you to leave the tool outside. I love how he goes back and rewrites history. \n\nI again reiterate that I don\u2019t want to be together right now, I want to work on myself. So we leave it with him seeming very dejected leaving, saying I don\u2019t understand the consequences of my actions, and that I shouldn\u2019t have been so lovey with him if I didn\u2019t want to get back together. I wasn\u2019t though? I shouldn\u2019t have asked him about kissing that\u2019s on me. But otherwise I was just being a nice person interested in talking to him? He acts like I begged him to come over, had sex with him, and then told him to get the f out or something. \n\nSo again I am left feeling like I did something wrong and idk what it even was. AITA?\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for your support! I always leave conversations with him feeling like I was in the wrong. It helps to write it out. In that spirit, adding more notes for myself so I can come back to it:\n\n- when I told him why I was hurt and how that caused me to break up with him, did not see my side, instead said if he knew it would have caused a break up he wouldn\u2019t have done it. No accountability\n- when I brought up his stark change in attitude and actions toward me last time we tried to make it work, blamed that on me as well. Lovebombing and talk of moving in together 3 days later talking about moving away because of me and my family\u2019s behavior toward him \n- when I brought up how a specific thing he said right before our breakup hurt me he said he didn\u2019t say that, then said he didn\u2019t mean it that way and how we always \u201cmisinterpret each other\u201d\n- said I was crazy for wanting to get a cat again (why is he so stuck on this? Why is it crazy? It bugs the crap out of me)\n- brought up how his mom thinks it\u2019s awful we arent talking right now (I love his mom- manipulation?)\n- brought up how someone during a meeting at his brand new job called him the smartest guy there and said how he could \u201calready be running the place\u201d (also said he\u2019s been working his ass off, then called in to work the next day while at my apartment for an inane thing that happening earlier in the morning- saying he was too stressed to deal with work rn)\n- also said that the teacher in his beginners class- the first class like this he has attended- said he does a certain thing \u201cbetter than she does\u201d and she basically \u201casked him to teach the class with her\u201d (his first time going?

I feel shitty because they met through me and my highschool sweetie about 25 years ago. The husband was in school with me and he was a chronic know it all, charismatic but there was just something very....off about him. Now I see what it was because it is exactly like my narc. He was a friend of my hss and she was my friend.\n\nSo long story short. For years I have thought there was something very weird about their relationship. He forced he to convert to his extreme brand of Christianity and they have 15 kids. But it isn't that, it is the whole \"life is too perfect\" thing she plays off, just like I did when I was protecting my abuser. He also does weird things like answers as her on social media (you can tell the difference), he had the cops called on a friend of ours because she disagreed with him online. He watches her fb like a hawk. She constantly praises him, even when he is being a total jackoff to others. And then there is another thing. They recently went out for a reunion with another friend of ours and her husband. My friend said that he would not leave his wife alone for a second, answered everything for her etc. When my friend tried to talk to the suspected other na victim friend while he was in the bathroom, he came running back and demanded to know EXACTLY what they were talking about, word for word, then demanded he and the wife left.\n\nI have been very open with my friend (not the one I suspect of being abused) about my problems and she said the first thing that Crosse her mind after spending time with those two was the woman was acting very almost headshy. \n\nAnyway, I am concerned. I don't know if I should bring it up that I am available for her to talk to (oh forgot, her husband banner her from DMing me because I am a Democrat) or what should I do? They pretty much secluded themselves where they live and I live out of the country, so dm is my only way.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I haven't shared this story with anyone yet and would like to hear some other perspectives on today's events. Background: I work for a tech company and deal closely with the business owner and developers. Today our app went down and I wake up from a message from the business owner stating as much. In their private communication, I guess the developers blamed me for the outage saying it had to do with me accessing the server. (I asked them a question about the servers a couple days before.) The business owner broadcasted this information to everyone in a group chat - basically telling me that these developers I work with threw me under the bus behind my back. 10 hours later it comes out that the outage was because the business owner neglected to pay the bill for the messaging system that is a critical part of our application and racked up a $3,000 bill that led to the account being suspended. I've tried my best to keep the developers isolated from the business owner since she has a pattern of losing her temper against them and becoming outraged during meetings. I feel hurt that they would try to blame me and that she would try to turn me against them by sharing something with me they told her in confidence in their personal messages.

My father neglected my family's emotional needs when I was a small child, And, from what I've heard, physically abused my sister. I have no recollection of those claims, so I'm not sure if it was traumatic or something. Most of my memories seem to be an odd Christmas here or there, but I mostly stayed in my room, and I would stay alone if my family was in turmoil. We had to move to a small, rural home after after the 2007-2009 recession, where soon we had no hot water, and lacked other basic necessities. and I hardly saw my father around. I spent most of my miserable life here, where every day I grew up with arguments and instability. My one escape was an xbox, where I had friends, and I played fun games. The happiest days of my life. However, the rural setting gave us poor service, and caused many conflicts between me and my sister.\n\n My mom and dad both had jobs, so I was at the mercy of my brutal older sister, who would batter me about, usually hitting my head, and she tried to controll every aspect of my life. My sister was bullied at school as well, so I could only assume that she was taking her anger out on me. I believe that this period left permanent scars on me. I likely have an eating disorder, as I often ate copius amounts of food to cope with my feeling of worthlessness, and I still eat to cope. Around this time, I joined chat rooms online, and was, once again, emotionally crippled by people who manipulated me. I've never told anyone about this. I spent almost all of my time in my room, neglected my school work, and just wanted to get out of the nightmare. After that year, I cut a lot of ties, and my parents were divorced. We moved into a town house, and things seemed to be looking up. \n\nMy mom had predicted that my sister would improve her behavior. Incorrectly. For the last 3-4 years I've been emotionally, psychically, and economically tormented. My sister is a deranged lunatic psychopathic kleptomaniac, who seems to try her hardest to ensure me, and my mother's misery is maximized. She looks for reasons to get down my throat, the lock on my door is broken, and every moment is suspenseful, painful anticipation, because she's fucking insane. She says shes going to college. My gut doesn't believe it, I know she's going to linger and poison us. \n\nI don't know what the fuck to do, I can't handle this anymore. I weigh nearly 300 lbs because I can't cope with stress in a normal fashion. I'm too scared to speak up and talk to anyone, becuase it'll break the fa\u00e7ade I have strategically built up over the years, and I simply dont have the courage to tear down this wall. \n\nI can easily make posts to strangers online, but this feels like an un-scaleable mountain of anguish in the flesh. I can't tell my friends, my family, or anyone if I don't have total anonymity. \n\nI don't know where to go from here.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I'm not still not sure if some stuff is real but I haven't been able to talk about it with anyone.\nThe relationship was really good for awhile and it was actually more of my fault that the initial problems came up. \n\nI've realized that I have a fearful avoidant attachment style due to childhood trauma. This causes me to enter into intense relationships but after a certain amount of time I get scared and start to pull away emotionally. While I was with my ex I was also taking  kratom every day which further numbed me and increased the emotional distance. I totally understand how damaging this could be to a partner. There were a few occasions when my partner talked to me about it and I always responded with validation. I told her I would try to do better but I wasn't ready. I didn't have nearly enough of a grasp on what was actually going on in my head at that point. At a certain point my partner started to be resentful towards me which I also understand. She gave up on talking about what the real problem was and instead started to misdirect her anger into little things. I didn't understand that was what was going on so I'd get defensive. The two fights we had the day we broke up the first time was over a \"look\" I gave her which I tried to explain was me picking food out of my tooth with my tongue, and me asking her to do dishes but then doing them myself cause she seemed stressed.  \nShe accused me of gas lighting her and told me I was an abuser. I believed her cause I thought that if someone you love tells you you're causing them harm you should listen. (I still believe that)\n\nAfter the call out the power dynamic shifted dramatically. I believed I was a bad person. That I shouldn't trust myself and to always listen to what my partner said over what I thought. This is when the abuse really started.\n\nShe convinced me that she had a right to treat me however the fuck she wanted cause I had \"been abusive\"  Id ask her if we could talk about how I was doing sometimes and she would tell me I didn't deserve it. If I brought up examples of times I've been supportive she'd convince me that it never happened. If I ever got upset or overwhelmed she'd tell I was feeling sorry for myself and that I was making it up in my head. I started having panic attacks because \"it's all in your head stop feeling sorry for yourself\" is a really bad mantra when you're having anxiety. I had an entire album of text screenshots titled \"your not crazy\" in case she tried to convince me a\nconvo never happened. She had this method of baiting me into being passive aggressive. She'd make healthy communication impossible and the second I would resort to passive aggression, she'd point to it as proof that I was a bad person. She cheated a lot but the one time I posted a picture with a female friend who's engaged, she said such hurtful and hateful shit that I didn't get out of bed for 2 solid days. \n\nThe worst part is that she had me so convinced that I was completely at fault that she convinced me to publicly out myself as an abuser. I lost all my friends. All the people I care about. I thought I was doing the right thing by wanting to be held accountable. When we finally broke up for good she lied to the one friend I had left about something I said and he cut me out. \nShe made me afraid to talk about my emotions. I question my memories constantly. And my motivations. I have no one left in my life. I don't know how to heal and move on when everyone I care about has cut me out.\n\nI still don't really know if anything she accused me of is real. She said she never felt supported but I'd look through old messages and find notes telling me how grateful she was to have such a supportive and caring partner. Another big red flag was when we first got back together she told me she got an unsolicited nude from a guy we knew. I looked on her phone mostly cause I couldn't sleep and was curious. Turns out the dude 100% asked permission and they wound going out for drinks. She brought it up completely unprompted. She wasnt trying to cover her tracks or hide anything. She just falsely accused someone of sexual harassment cause she could.\n\nI try to own up to my mistakes and be accountable if I've cause harm but I don't know what's real anymore.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I still go from thinking it was emotional abuse to worrying I'm just a narcissistic prick. I was constantly guilt tripped as she used her depression, social anxiety, suicide attempts and previous abuse from her ex, as a means to isolate me. Message and ring constantly to check where I was, gaslighted me about events I knew happened. Interrogated me about any girls she knew I worked with at uni or at work. Checked my phone multiple times without my permission. Love bombed me with random stuff, tried to control how I spent my money. Guilt tripped me into sex, printed out leaflets on social anxiety and forced me to read them. she had two or three stories/sentences she would use over and over again. \"If I was in a wheelchair people would treat me differently\", \"it's easy for you, I lost all my friends in HS\".\n\nOne of the weirdest things she did that really annoyed me at the time was constantly ask for my attention. She would cling onto me 24/7, yet that somehow wasn't enough. I would be on my computer getting a rare moment of time to myself and she would call my name like a dog or something. She would say \"pay attention to me\". Then one time while it bed, she tried to be playful and take all the covers from me when I had work early next morning and I cracked telling her to \"leave me the fuck alone for once\". She started crying I felt bad and I never cracked like this again. She would get upset really easily about random stuff too, would have me walking on eggshells constantly. She liked these ghost adventure shows and I joked about how silly they were and she started crying, despite the fact she used to take the piss out of game of thrones constantly. Then one time we were watching something, I made a joke and she stormed out the living room and into the bedroom. I came in expecting an earful and she said she was joking. I actually kinda stood up for myself and said \"how am I suppose to tell that's a joke\". Bear in mind that she got upset about a lot of weird things. For example, the idea that I used to go on nights out, that I smoked weed twice in my whole life. Weirdest of all was when she got upset because I went through loads of crisps in one night. She said she worried about money. Erm I brought them with my money and I have a part time job and student loan. She got pissy at the idea of me spending money with my friends. One time I said I didn't want to spend the money going out to eat, then one week later when I was gonna do something with my housemates. It got thrown in my face. \"So your willing to spend money on them but not me\". I spent money all the time on her wtf. Theres more, but I still doubt myself, why?\n\nNow that I'm out I can notice the damage more and it's horrible.

I look back at my degree and I honestly don't know how the fuck I did it. I'm proud of that at the very least I guess.

(phase 3, second bullet point)   \nNo violence included. \n\nSo, I've met a narcissist at college (a special school in my country that prepares you for a specific job, for me it was becoming a Kindergardener) . I was 19 years old and lived alone due to a big fight in my family some years before that let me to run away from home and live on my own. The narcissist was 28 and attended all classes with me. At the first day of school I found out he got no placement in a kindergarden (which is needed) so he may had to quit the next week. There where still places for college students in my kindergarden so I told him and he also joined me there. So the only time we wouldnt see each other was the weekend.   \nI never heard about narcissists before but he dived right into trapping me in.\n\nPhase 1: Lovebombing  \nBecause I got the placement for him in the kindergarden (I didnt, I just told him that we have slots left) he told me Im his livesaver, I was his faith and stuff. He wrote me little notes in class thanking me and asking me to go out with him. I was flattered and accepted.\n\nPhase 2: All about him being flawless  \nWhen we got out, he invited me to clubs where he brought some of his friends. He bragged about how good he could dance (he was skinny af and I thought this was pretty hot) He spoke about his hobbies, his interests and needless to say: I learned a lot about him while basically saying one or two things about me. But I was a shy person around this time so I was fine with someone else in the spotlight. I became his girlfriend just after 2-3 weeks.  \nIn college and at work he also talked about what a practical guy he was. He liked construction, working with wood, crafting etc. That gave me the illusion of him being confident and having a nice life with nice, not so ordinary hobbies. I like creative stuff too.\n\nPhase 3: His flaws where aweful  \nOnce we knew each other for about 8 weeks he invited me to his place for the first time. I met his parents, who where really nice, older people and he told me he lives with them to support them in live. I liked the idea of living as a family coz of my past. Maybe I liked it a little too much. I spend some weekends there and learned some bizarre stuff:\n\n\\- He lived in a room that was an absolut mess. I never found out the color of his floor, there where school papers, bottles and junk lying around. On one wall there was a faded caendar from 3 years ago! He said its unfair that I wanted him to clean his room due to me not giving him a chance, just because \"school was a little stressful the last weeks\" and his room would never be like this when times got better. I just shouldnt put so much extra stress on him\n\n\\- His so called \"suicide heater\" (he gave it that name) put burn-scars on my back and shoulder the first night I spend there and he blamed me for not being careful (while being asleep lol)\n\n\\- He lived with his parents because he was 100% broke. He got kicked out of another college before and somehow managed to have a 5000$ dept that he wont be able to pay and that would rise every month because he wasnt able to even pay a part of it. His parents knew about it and just forced him to go to another college to get a job and then pay the dept later.\n\n\\- He talked about this crafting, and his love to work with wood, but I never saw him doing even a little bit. He told me how his dad chopped down a tree and hes gonna build a bench from it and once sat down with a piece of wood wanting to make a bowl out of it. But except for cutting it a little smaller and drilling a maybe 1 inch deep hole in it, he never worked on something. \n\n\\- We had 3 weeks of holiday and he promised hes gonna spend the first days cleaning his room completely. I told him thats really nice and asked if he needed help. He wanted to do it on his own, but got mad on me when I rather wanted to stay at my place then hanging around outside his room or with his parents while he cleans. (I liked his parents. But I liked the idea of spending some time just by myself and following my hobbies (mainly art) than needing to wait for days alone until hes finished and sleep in a guest room there...\n\n\\- He never cleaned his room. He just made it a little less messy and then talked to his parents to get one of the rooms in this big house as my own room (so I would spend the nights and stops complaining about his room) He even got me and own bed there, brought me to bed at around ten, then blasted music in his room (right next to mine) while he locked the door\n\n\\- His biggest interests where all about viking culture, runes and stuff.  He tried to put that on me and never listened to what I believe, what my opinions where and stuff. Wen I disagreed (just coz my believes are differend) he just demanded I read more about viking culture. He never read about or listened to what I believe. And when I told him about it, he just made fun or find arguments against my believes.\n\nPhase 4: He wanted a future he'd already planned fully in detail  \nWhen he got 29 (we knew each other for about 4 months) he told me how important it is that he is married before turning 30 and how completely disappointed he is that he will become an old father. We never talked about kids or marriage before. I once mentioned that I wanna be a mother one day but I was in college, I wanted to finish it and work after that. I remembered him of his high dept and told him carefully, that with this still in the room, he shouldnt think about family or marriage coz that costs alot and he isnt stable for a future with a child yet. (and including that he owed his old college 5000$ showed me how expensive kids can be even way after they grew up to adults!)   \nBut he wanted to marry me (he never proposed, just talked about it) and had specific plans after that!\n\n\\- Our marriage would be a viking style marriage (basically including a one-week stay in Iceland or somewhere \"nordic\") where we drink a lot of beer, are dressed in the same animal-fur and selfmade clothes all the time like old vikings and drink even more beer before swearing to the nordic gods that we will immediatelly \"do it\" to get a child 9 month after the wedding ceremony (and I think it also included killing a sheep or goat for the gods. Im not a vegetarian, but I would never just kill an animal like this by myself)\n\n\\- Our children would be at least 3, better 5 and all would have nordic names. He chose them already so they would suit to his last name... Most of them where from the netflix series \"Vikings\"\n\n\\- I would spend my time pregnant with sewing and making stuff for my kids. He would make babybeds for them on his own and we wont buy clothes or objects with child like designs (like bears, hearts, etc.) on them. All viking styled only. \n\n\\- After all the kids are raised to go to kindergarden, he would retire from work and become a stay at home day because his children should grow up with a manly father figure and learn all about working with wood, slaughter animals etc.\n\n\\- He only spoke about male baby names and about a future having sons. He would write little notes in school with baby names and basically tell me how nice they are (not even asking for approval, just informing me) when I said I wanna focus on the lessons or didnt like the names, he would give me the silent treatment even in kindergarden until his mother would pick us up from college at friday and bring me home. (If I refused she would give me half an hour talk on the spot that I needed to come and talk to her, everything is gonna be fine etc.) That drove me crazy every time. I started hating him and the whole situation.\n\nPhase 5: I broke down and broke up  \nThe last talk we had was in his kitchen. He gave me the silent treatment from tuesday till now (friday afternoon) and we sat in the kitchen eating. After that his mother showed me a lightly beige blaked with a yellow and brown flower print. She told me, she loved the fabric (and tbh I loved it too) and got this blanked from a friend. She wanted to show me how to sew baby clothes. It flattered me a little and since I thought maybe this would give me the chance to talk to her about all the stress thats on me, now her son only pushes me into his believes, I agreed to join her.   \nShe asked me, still in the kitchen, what a possible name for my daughter would be. It freaked me out a little. I got sad and just replied \"I first wanna do college, work a little and when I get pregnant one day, we can think of a nice daugters name, ok?\" She just asked her son, what name a daugter would get. (Did she even listen to me a second ago?!)   \nHe said \" A girl is her responsibility. I dont care. But she will get interessted in runes and all this cool stuff later so you better choose a really good name or she won't fit into my family!\"   \nI cried and screamed to his mother to drive me home immediately! Three days later this man had the audacity to show up at my place with his father, apologizing in half a second and demand to give him a second chance in the other (because he already bought a wedding ring and wanted to ask me this weekend - I never saw the ring so I dont believe him). I screamed at him and he got out never to be seen again. I was to scared and angry and stopped showing up at college and in the kindergarden. Needless to say, I failed...\n\nTwo years later I now live on the other side of the country. I started a whole new live and found a man I really like and that gives me alot of time. I work in a nice kindergarden where my colleagues are proud and can depend on me all the time. I plan to have kids with my new boyfriend once we got enough money aside and can efford a bigger flat together. But until then I can work and Im really happy. I still attend therapy and cry about minor mistakes sometimes, but I feel the healing making big steps.\n\nThanks for reading my story &lt;3\n\nUPDATE\nYesterday I got a text from a girl I dont know. She asked me about him and his behaviour in our relationship. I was confused and just asked back who she is. She is his newest ex girlfriend who is now stuck in college class with him. \nShe was really nice and told me she broke up with him after not even two months because she got his bs fast and was annoyed by him. He now tells horrible stories about her and also about me. First she believed him saying I cheated on him multiple times, was mean to his friends and that I talked HIM into having kids. He says now its rediculous to talk about babys that fast.\nBut now that he lies about her too and she saw me sometimes at college (I didnt know her but some of my friends did) she wanted to know the truth. I told her to make her research about narcissistic behaviour and it blew her mind! We are still texting and share alot of interests, so I kinda think I found a friend in her.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I completely understood that this was a joke so didn't reply. She then said \"I'm only joking, don't cry about it\", I just don't understand why she says stuff like this.\n* As mentioned in the previous posts, she likes going through my phone. A few weeks ago, I woke up in the middle of the night to her questioning me about some YouTube videos I had watched on my phone and messages I had sent to friends/family members (innocent messages). It shocked me that she had got my phone whilst I was asleep and sat there looking through it. A few days after this incident I changed my phone password to prevent her from doing this. I have absolutely nothing to hide but feel I am entitled to some level of privacy (especially considering her history of obsessing over my phone). The other morning she tried going through my phone again while I wasn't in the room and then asked me why I had changed my password, said how I had broken her trust and **in her own words** \"I should know what your password is\". When I said about how my trust had been slightly broken by her going through my phone, she started crying which makes me feel so guilty.\n\nI just have no idea what to do anymore.

In the past two years we met abroad while doing the same studies, we lived in the close to each other the first year, moved in together during the six months that followed then were in an LDR during the last six months and still are in different countries now for up until February/ March were we planned to get married and move in together. After graduating last month I moved in back to my parents he moved for work to another country. \n\nI was and still am struggling to adapt to everything, I never lived with my parents since high school, plus re-adapting to everything again in a very traditional country were it's not easy to be a women sucks.\n\nSo when everything in my life was unsure, I don't know what to do next were to go, who to talk to, I turned to the only person I knew that would always be there for me, or so I thought. On a Sunday, I called him as usual, I made myself vulnerable and shared with him all my struggles and worries and he was yet once again emotionally unsupportive and unavailable, judging, mansplaining, giving unsolicited advises on how I should and shouldn't do things. He managed to suck up the few energy I had left for myself. I was drained as I never was in my life, I was upset, disappointed, enraged and at the edge of my sanity.\n\nI never knew he was narcissistic or anything, let alone covert narcissistic, however, I experienced his selfishness, lack of empathy and emotional unavailability after the first 6 months of our relationship. I always thought and he explained to me that he has issues to express himself and give support as he never received any from his parents but always promised to do efforts towards that. So I understood as my parents were quite similar. \n\nBut after last Sunday, I told him that I need sometime to take care of myself and went NC. I started then reading and consulting blogs and YouTube videos and I realized for the first time that he is a covert narcissistic. Everything started to make sense. The love bombing, the energy-draining the degradation and doubts, the gaslighting everything!! I discovered along the way that I am a co-dependent, I know that I avoid conflict, I am a caregiver by nature and almost all what a co-dependent is which made us the perfect toxic fit for each other.\n\nNow I am afraid and really don't know what to do, I feel trapped in a golden jail sometimes I wanna leave without saying goodbye and sometimes I wanna stay and cope with everything. I am not sure about my emotions now but I really loved him, we share a lot of hobbies and views about things, we have a lot of projects together and have planned our future together, how many kids we wanna have, their names the name of our sailboat and a whole lot of other details.\nAnother important detail, is that he is my first love, I had few boyfriends before him but I never felt so in love toward any one of them and never slept with either of them so, he was the first and the only one I ever slept with and I discovered my sexuality with him.\n\nNow I don't know what to do. I told him that the last fight made me think and re-assess our 2 years relationship, and that I am not ready to talk. Now it has been 10 days, we never stopped talking for more than a couple of days. I feel that I need to end this silence but with all this, in mind, I don't know how? I know that I don't wanna break up with him, but I know that I am not sure about marrying him or mooving in with him anymore.\nA lot of people advised to never face a narcissist with his truth as he may hurt you, I am afraid, sad, I cry everyday and everywhere, I am thinking and overthinking, and feel very isolated. I can't share with my family and I don't have friends in here anymore to talk to and I didn't keep any from my last years as I was isolating and investing myself too much in the relationship. \nI don't have the means to go to therapy and I am desperate for some help and advise.\n\nThank you for reading through and reaching out to me I appreciate it!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

All I can be grateful for is that, frankly, he is unattractive so hopefully no one agreed to sleep with him. \n\nMostly I am afraid because I have a partner I truly love now, and I do not want to lose him. My lack of regard for my health (argh, why didn't I get tested sooner?) alone might be enough to put him off of seeing me. And if I do have something...well, what then?\n\nI had my blood drawn yesterday so I will know in a weekish what's up...but until then, I just don't know what to do.

I have been alone the whole time.\n\nThe narc would bring our 3 kids up to see me for max 30mins per day, he would sit down and immediately go on his phone, let the kids climb all over my bed which was far from ideal and then hurry out the door for whichever reason of the day - got to get car fixed, meet friend or go fishing. So for 23 1/2 hours a day i was alone in my hospital bed, freaking out, lonely and worried. Not one card, not even a get well soon present.  The nurses and cleaning staff were the ones who helped and soothed me when i was hysterically crying - worried about my future, how i would cope and feeling terribly depressed. \n\nMeanwhile the narc has been home living his best life on carers leave - over these 12 days he has been fishing over 8 times and had 4 large drunken get togethers at our house (whilst being the kids sole caretaker) and i was alone and terrified in a hospital room. When i had to get flown out to a larger hospital to have spinal surgery, he never offered to come down and be with me. All i get is a text in the morning \"hows ya back?\". \n\nLast night - day 2 after my op - i called him as he had not called me all day and he was out to dinner with his friends and my kids, drunk again with his best friend the designated driver. WTF?? How do these people exist? Not one ounce of empathy or concern. \n\nHonestly i have been out of the fog for a while and aware of his narc tendencies but i am so so do hurt with how he has acted. He does not give a shit about me - its plain to see - my sickness has been the perfect excuse to party for him. But today i fly home and will be discharged - i obviously need help and he is to be off work for another 3 weeks to help me look after the kids but i dont even want to see him. I am disgusted by him and of course if i ever bring his behaviour up, it will be all my fault or met by rage. I just want out but obviously cant do that right now as cannot move well and need help with the kids.\n\nSo my plan is to act like eveything is fine and when he goes back to work in 3 weeks (he works away 7days on 7 off) i will drop his car and clothes at his mums, get the locks changed on the house (i am the only one on the deed) and break up with him. He is going to go crazy but his behaviour has been seen by all and many people are also horrified and i hope once he realises this may back down to recover a bit of his precious ego/reputation. What do you guys think? I am also going to contact the police domestic violence unit for extra back up and i will not hesitate to take out a restraining order if he threatens me which he has done before. Luckily, my work is extremely supportive and will help me any way they can. I cannot stand to be with this man for any longer than i have to. Any advice greatly appreciated.

The kiddo, who had just turned 9, was suffering the most. Me and my kid saw the dr to get Tamiflu. The narc refused to be seen, as he could \u201cjust get over it\u201d. \n\nThe weekend goes by, all of us just trying to survive this nasty virus. Poor kiddo is reacting badly to the antibiotics, constant diarrhea keeps him close to the bathroom.  Finally, the course of medicine has been finished and I was ready to go back to work. Kiddo was ready to go back to school. \nLater that night, kiddo tells me that he threw up, and that it looks weird. Asks me to see it. Looks like coffee grounds. That\u2019s no good. \n\nWe take kiddo to the ER for a scare of a stomach ulcer or esophagus tear. The entire night, Narc had been complaining about the waiting time. Children\u2019s ER is busy that time of year. Lots of sick kids to be seen. \nNarc continues to complain. Gets mad when I can\u2019t give him an accurate waiting time. Begins to berate kiddo because it\u2019s obviously his fault we are here. Kiddo should be taking better care of himself! Kiddo should have eaten all food and drink that was offered to him, regardless of how sick he was. Doesn\u2019t matter that kiddo had strep and it hurt to eat. Doesn\u2019t matter that kiddo\u2019s tummy wasn\u2019t feeling good because of the medicine. Did Narc take care of the kiddo at all while we were sick? Nope! So it is not only kiddo\u2019s fault, but mine as well, because I didn\u2019t force him to eat everything I made. \n\nI beg the Narc to just go home. I would text him when we were done. He refused. Narc says he needs to be there so he can confirm that whatever he believes to have caused the blood puke is the truth, and he can rub it in our faces later. \n\nPoor kiddo has to get blood drawn. He begins to cry when the needle goes in. The vein blew. Gonna have to get another poke on the other hand. Narc berates kiddo that none of this would be happening if he ate his food. Another poke, another bad vein. Poor kiddo is inconsolable now. Narc is getting angry, he can\u2019t possibly imagine that needles and kids don\u2019t pair well. \n\nFinally, blood is drawn after a 3rd poke. Kiddo is watching tv and trying to point cool things out on commercials. Keeps trying to make conversation with Narc, and the only thing the Narc can reply with is \u201cNO.\u201d A simple shut down to any attempt at kiddo wanting to talk. \n\nFinally it\u2019s time to go home. I can tell Narc is livid at his time being wasted, despite my pleas to drop us off earlier. Narc parked as far away from the ER as possible, up as many stairs as it took for him to feel would be a significant punishment to us while we try to recover from pneumonia. He walks his usual fast pace, keeping a good distance ahead of us while I carry my sick child, who is almost as tall as I am. \n\nThe next day came and all the Narc had to say was \u201che better clean his room after school\u201d. \nNo time for homework or getting caught up on makeup work for being out that last week. No time to unwind from the school/work day after the deprivation of sleep. Only allowed to do what the Narc says. \n\nCan happily say that kiddo has since recovered, and never again will I allow a Narc in mine or my child\u2019s life.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Not major things, but graffiti, climbing things, etc. At first I thought it was cute, but then she started doing stuff and talking about doing stuff while I was with her, which made me feel *deeply* uncomfortable. I was terrified of having a run in with the police. Note, I have no respect for cops, but being someone who\u2019s a survivor of abuse, who dealt with further abuse from cops because I am queer, I was not fond of the idea of running into them. I said okay cool, do it on your own, but I don\u2019t want to be there for it, and I\u2019d prefer if you didn\u2019t even when I was there, because I wanted to protect both her and myself from the shit we face from cops.  \nThen, about a year into our relationship, she starts being intimate with a close friend of ours, but she says it\u2019s strictly as friends, and it\u2019s no more than hand holding and kissing, so even though it makes me uncomfortable, I say it\u2019s nbd, but I\u2019d prefer to be there and be part of the situation so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m third wheeling the relationship.  \nThen she starts developing romantic feelings for this other lady. Whatever, I get it, you can\u2019t control feelings, but I\u2019m like hey, I\u2019m really uncomfortable with this, can I maybe be there when y\u2019all are together more often so I can feel like I\u2019m part of my own relationship?  \n\nAlso, if she didn\u2019t get what she wanted, she\u2019d spiral, and become suicidal, so I felt I couldn\u2019t confront her ever.  \nAnd then she dumps me.  \nNow, she\u2019s saying to people I was \u201csemi emotionally abusive\u201d. But, while I don\u2019t feel she was abusive, I feel she was not understanding of my needs and wants, and we often did what she wanted, leaving me in the dust and an anxious mess (especially with the illegal stuff). And I could rarely tell her how I felt or what I wanted. But her and I are still good friends, and I want to make amends.  \nHow do I go about approaching her about this?

A fact that didnt help my depression. I would fall into spirals of feel undeserving of love and felt as if I was a waste of human life and eventually, I tried to take my own life. But as I was about to plunge that knife into my chest I thought of her. Let's call her C. C was a new friend I had made that year, my final year of high school. I had gotten close to her and well I felt as if I couldnt talk to anybody else but her. She came over and basically saved my life. I started falling for her and right before my graduation I kissed her and she kissed me back. We were dating and I was so happy. Finally I had someone, to talk to, to give me affection and to show me what love was. What i didnt know was the rabbit hole i just fell into.\n\nI knew she had struggles with mental health and i was there the entire time as her rock. But thay quickly transformed into tacking care of her baggage. Every how are you turned into depression. To the point where i felt even mentioning my emotions was rude and selfish. She told me she was tired of being my baby sitter and therapist, when I cooked, cleaned and took care of her for over a year. I started isolating myself. She always wanted my time and to spend even a second without her she would get upset. I stopped working out because she needed me. I stopped seeing friends because I always had other plans. I stopped seeing my family because she was my family now. She was making me dependent and I was so desperate for love that I fell in deeper. That's when she would justify her abuse through her own depression. But she never dealt with it. Never dealt with her own mental problems and whenever I would suggest to see someone she never went. I started to fall into a depression  one that everyone saw but I never knew what caused it. It was her. She had taken away everything I loved to do and replaced it with her own control. I wanted to break up but felt too scared and was too worried about her, to the point I would forgo my own mental and physical health for hers. We never celebrated my accomplishments only hers. Her well being was always the priority. I became second fiddle in my own life and I didnt even realise. I was being controlled in nearly every aspect of my life.\n\nAll this made it all the harder when we broke up. We said it was a break and would be friends but that only applied to me. She would date and when I found out... i broke. I asked to get back together and she said she could never love me again. I was already broken but that's what sealed it. I was inconsolable. I was a mess. I was angry. She was a void that took my life over for 2 years. This summer was one of growth but I've only recently come into terms of my own tramau. She was half my size but I was terrified of her getting angry with me, making a mistake or losing her affection  growing cold and distant. I've only recently started even thinking about dating but as we still live in the same area I see her sometimes and it just sends me spiralling. I'm better now but I wish her influence would just leave already. I'm trying to hard. And honeslty writing all this down has made me feel.. lighter. I will fully recover.

I sugar coated and distorted all my relationships up until now. \n\nThe past week or so I have started remembering the way my father would behave with me. I want to know if it\u2019s normal or I\u2019m blowing things out of proportion. \n\nWhen I was 11 my father dropped me for a movie with my friends - this is something that never happened, my parents were always busy to do so or I didn\u2019t have any friends as they changed my schools so often. \n\nSo he decided to wait with me until my friends were there and we waited for, I think 5 mins before he said\n\n \u201cYour friends aren\u2019t coming. They played a prank on you. You look like an idiot that\u2019s why they did this. They\u2019re probably at home laughing,\u201d \n\nLike a few mins after he Said that, my friends came. They were stuck in traffic. \n\nLast year I cut out a lot of dysfunctional friendships. And I ended up letting my parents know. I don\u2019t know why. Maybe I was hoping to have a tender moment and support? Idk even, I was so delusional. \n\nMy dad went all \u201cNo one comes near you. I bet you\u2019re all on your own in your college. All your friends avoid you. They laugh at you. They hate being around you since you\u2019re so nasty. You stink. You didn\u2019t even get a single call so far.

Very important and special?\u201d He would look pretty ridiculous but it felt really cruel and petty. \n\nIt was completely unprovoked. There are so many other things he\u2019s said. He\u2019s called me nasty, evil, envious. \n\nI don\u2019t even know why. I got all the right grades. I have never given them trouble. I relied on friends and outsiders majorly growing up. It\u2019s like I can\u2019t do anything right. Even the smallest issue he would jump on my throat. He\u2019s never been physically abusive - my brother and mom made up for that - but the things he\u2019s said really affected me. \n\nI don\u2019t know if he wants to crush my confidence so I can stay reliant on him so he can have power over me and keep abusing me.\n\nI didn\u2019t really spend much time with him growing up. Like he would buy me things I wanted but I think it was just to show off to others that he\u2019s a great dad? I\u2019m not that attached to any of my family and I feel guilty about it.\n\nIs his behaviour normal though? Like a bit complex like every other family? Or is this abnormal?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I've been struggling to process alot of things as of late and have decided to turn to a community I feel I can trust to attempt to align my thoughts around this, so first, thank you all for providing a space I feel safe to confide in.\nAnd secondly what I'm struggling with is healthily processing my relationship with my ex. I was 15 (M) and she was 18 (F) when we got together. It was not legal and I didn't realize what kind of a relationship I was putting myself into. She was an adult, I was a fucking kid, she introduced me to hard liquor, and drugs,  a very skewed concept of what a healthy sex life was and what a healthy relationship was. By the time I was 16, I was married to a 19 yr old who just wanted me to go out and work, come home, clean and take care of some house, cook for her, and then have sex for hours. I hated it, I became a 17 yr old physically healthy male who hated getting laid, and I couldn't figure out why. My ex made it a huge issue too, it wasn't ok for me to not want to have sex. I said no so many times, and yet so many of those times I remember sleeping with her just so she would stop asking, or touching me, or touching me, or touching me, or touching me, or touching me (that makes me want to scream), and/or saying specific phrases over and over. It wasn't until I was 18, and got an opened look into the world, by moving out of state with my ex, that I realized something was wrong. I wasn't asexual, my brain was just desperately searching for labels as to why I wasn't enjoying sex. Withing days of moving and my eyes being opened (less than a month after I turned 18) our relationship completely fell apart, she was cheating on me, (breaking the rules of our open marriage at the time) directly disrespecting me, and going out of her way to drag my name down with false accusations. I was done, I broke up with her, I said  look, I can't do this anymore, let's take a break and see what we might look like in a couple weeks. By the end of that night, I knew we weren't getting back together, she was accusing me of being abusive, sociopathic, and that I had this \"big plan\" to hurt her (she was very mentally ill in these moments, her physical wellbeing was completely out of check, she had not been eating, drinking, or sleeping nearly enough for days.  Directly after using, to my knowledge, just LSD). Shortly after this she leaves the state to go live with her mom, upon leaving the state she steals my car keys and keyring, my mobile battery, my AAA' card and a few other items. Some time passes (a few days? Not sure it's all blurry) Im on a 7 day farm shift 400 miles away and can't leave, I get a call letting me know that my ex, her mom, her aunt, and a mystery individual broke into my car (using the stolen keys) and that they had left with a large amount of property. When I finally made it back to my car and was able to get into it (thank God my fam had a spare to mail in from out of state) I discovered some of my most important physical possessions completely gone, my bank information, my passport, my birth certificate, my marriage license, my SSN, and almost all my other relevant/legally relevant documents all gone. I check my bank account to find it completely empty, my savings drained. My ex took it all. Within days I get a call from my parents, letting me know that my ex and her family broke in (using my house key from the stolen keys ring) and took the things she and I had been storing there. I understand her getting her items, but to take mine too? But then she left certain (full boxes) important items and later accused me of stealing them through text. I was in a different state, literally couldn't have. Some days later I get an MMS, in the group chat is me, my 3 bosses, and my exes mother's numbers. My ex and her mom built a horrific and fake accusation towards me of being a creep, a liar, and that I had beastiality porn on a device of mine, that they had stolen, and somehow broken into. They sent that to my fucking bosses. I literally could not believe it was happening. Lucky for me my bosses realized my ex was just out to get me. And I didn't get looked at weird for too long. It's now been a few months of static (besides her, known to be the family bruiser, cousin hitting me up trying to get my location) and I'm just slowly working on divorce papers. The last month has been rough, I've been reflecting on why I hate my sex life, and i was abruptly shown and, I cannot believe how obvious it was and I didn't notice before, that my ex was kind of a pedo, and that a more mature person was looking at me, seeing what I wasn't seeing, and taking advantage of it. I am 18 and 6months, I am the same age my ex was when we got together. Yet I thoroughly recognize that if a 15 yr old came up to me and was flirting/clearly trying to get with me (like I did with my ex) I would tell them to fuck off, and I would seriously advise them towards waiting to have sexual encounters with adults until they are themselves an adult...\nI'm struggling to deal with whats happened. I handling it all so well until I took a step back and saw how fucked up the whole situation was. Right from the beginning. AND NO ONE IN MY LIFE TOLD ME IT WAS A BAD IDEA. They all knew, I've talked to them about it now. They regret so heavily not telling me. I was just so confident and sure that it was all good, and happy, and that it was healthy for me, an immature and traumatized teen to be in a relationship with an adult, that somehow my confidence persuaded not only my family and friends, but hers too that everything was ok, and there was nothing wrong with the illegal age difference. Up the the age of 15 I had been dealing with years of being forced to take horribly high doses of methylphenidate, physical and emotional abuse, PTSD, depression, suicidality and anxiety. So of course when this \"kind\" beautiful woman shows up right after some heavy parental trauma, and starts telling me how smart, capable, and mature I am. I fell for it. I chose to walk, unknowingly, right into her pedo trap. How do I deal with that?\nHow do I deal with that? \nHow do I deal with that I was married to a women who knowingly was taking advantage of my younger mind? How do I deal with that my sexual boundaries were violated for so long? How do I deal with all these dark, and traumatic thought loops now showing up around the context of her having taken advantage of me?\nI hope this is the right place to post and that you guys can give me some insight/info/anything you might see that I'm missing. \nYears of beatings, attempted murders(3), parental and siblings abuse, involuntary drug use, and mental health issues somehow seem easy to deal with/have dealt with vs what I am currently up against in my own mind.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

At this point everyone pretty much knows to not mention him around me, but this person is out the loop. I also have not talked to him because he is a friend if my nex and... well, you cant do that. This person also thinks my nex is the funniest coolest person to ever exist. So it was weird being around him but he didnt mention my nex at all, at first. I also know that he probably believes the lies from my nex that I cut contact with my nex because I love him so much that if I'm not with him I hate him. Yes. Read that again lol. Narcissistic mental gymnastics. Wow. \n\nIn my nexs mind, I didnt cut him out if my life because I genuinely DON'T Like him.  oh noooo that won't suit his ego. It's that I'm so obsessed and love sick for him, because obviously he's the perfect man \ud83d\ude44 that if I can't have him I hate him. I only know this because of having to hear it through the grapevine. At the time I laughed and I didnt let it get to me at the time. That was 5 months ago. But it still bothered me because of how utterly untrue it is and how I knew people would believe him. \n\n I've gone through plenty of healthy heart ache in my life and reacted so well it blows people's minds. For example,  I am happy for my first ex and his new fiance I think they are well suited and I care about them both. My first ex left me for the same girl he had left me for in the past. I am genuinely happy for them in a situation that would upset any reasonable person. That that is my reality. I cant help it. I am a kind gracious person who enjoys the happiness of others.

I hate him because he toyed with me for two years and extracted everything he could from me before leaving me an anxious suicidal, depressed mess with panic attacks. All I ever was to him was kind and supportive even when I was in tears night after night at his expense. I put up with so much before breaking. So much. I dont have currently or ever have struggled with depression until him.  I have never had anxiety until him. I have never experienced a ptsd reaction to anything as I have had no prior trauma until my nex. Of all the people in the world to abuse he picked one who could easily compare his bad behavior to the truly good behavior of others. I had all the tools to see the warning signs and get out unscathed and it didnt matter. There is no way to win. \n\nHow did his abuse affect me in the end? I had a break down, quit my job, moved in the parents (who are wonderful) got a better job, reversed my debt, got a car, worked out, went to trauma therapy, got out of bed each day. It was hard it was work it was more crying than I've ever done in my years on this earth combined. \n\nI've spent the past 18 months working on myself  and I thought I was over it.

True no contact no way to get to me no way for to even see pictures of him. At this concert, my old friends face lit up as he recounted the funny brilliant joke of my nex.

I feel like my suffering is a joke. I'm so angry. So angry. I'm sitting here at work trying to fight back tears wondering why I live in this world with these people and there's nothing I can do about it. My nex claims to be an abuse victim himself, as many of them do. What a perfect cover. Everyone believes him. Not based on my experiences. My real experiences. Reality. The girl from his past who he claims abused him did not. He abused that poor girl for two years and twisted it around to look like she was abuser. And people believe him.

It's not. \n\nI guess what I need is support and validation. What else can I ask for? . I'm trying very hard to let go of my need for the world to be a \"fair\" place where the good guys win. Where people aren't subjected to suffering to feed the egos of crazy people and there is no justice . I know he's miserable and I know he hates himself but it's not enough. I need other people to tell me all the things I've been trying to tell myself that aren't working today because I'm struggling.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Just feeling the need to put a little rant into the reddit universe to help me process some emotions. \n\nSo I still havent been able to get this guy out of my house. He keeps trying to have sex with me. He thinks everything is fine, cause things were always fine after he fucked up time and time again. After this last time, I could feel it within me that this time was *different* and I am not romantically attracted to him anymore. It is seriously like a switch flipped and those feelings are GONE. I have no love left. No patience left. I've never experienced a feeling like this before. \n\nNow I'm mad. I feel self righteous and full of contempt for him. I've decided I'm working hard on finishing a couple renovations on my home and then I'm selling it. Fuck this and fuck this shit. I'm so done and I just want this asshole out of my life.\n\nI am able to be friendly enough. I make jokes about him cheating on me and laugh. Sometimes I am outright mean and insinuate he is stupid and laugh. He seems confused and has tried to sit me down a couple times, but I just keep repeating that there is nothing to discuss and walk away. No more chances to mindfuck me dickhead! I sacrificed everything for this useless parasite only for him to betray me time and time again. For him to damage my home, my finances, my body, my heart, my soul. For him to poison all of my relationships. He does NOT get my future. I dont give a flying fuck about what he says about me. I care even less for what he thinks about me. \n\nI hope to have everything done and have the house on the market by January/February. I'm looking into school to change careers. I'm busting my ass at the gym and I'm in the best shape of my life. I'm eating healthy, sleeping well, and taking good care of myself. Once my house sells I will have a fair amount of cash to put towards a new place and a new life for my children and I. I'm planning on downsizing to lessen financial stress, and allow me more time to be there with my kids. Maybe take vacations. I would love to take them on a Disney cruise. The future is bright for us. The kids and I deserve to be happy and away from the toxic sewage that he spews. Fuck that guy. He can go to the gutter and sleep with the degenerate meth heads he loves so much. If he dares to even threaten to physically harm me again, I will have him thrown in jail without any hesitation or remorse. And when he gets out we will be long gone. \n\nI'm so angry. I'm angry with \"god\" or whatever universal entity put this person in my life. I had so much faith and I asked for so many signs and I followed them. How could it all be so wrong? How could I ever have faith when it lead me to this? Mostly I am angry at myself. That I allowed this. I'm angry I brought 2 innocent children into this world with this monster of a person. I'm angry that I allowed myself to be manipulated and played like a fucking fiddle. I am disgusted with myself, I feel so pathetic. I'm angry that my empathy and kindness was used against me. I know now that the only person I can depend on is myself. The only person looking out for me, is me.\n\nIf anyone read this thanks! Felt good to get that out. I loved this guy with my entire heart and soul. I've known him my entire life, since we were 5 years old. He was my first love. I lost my virginity to him. I built my life around him. I supported him in every way. I forgave unforgivable acts. And I believed in him, and I believed in us, and I believed in love. And I was wrong. And that's ok.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

After that I told myself I would *never* put myself through that stress again. I have already enough anxiety in my life, I don't want to add anymore.\n\nIn the past 4 years I rekindled with an old friend of mine. We ended up becoming very close friends. I know that she has anger issues and she says she is working on them. We don't live in the same state but we would talk/ft almost every day.

It's like walking on eggshells with her, but she draws you in by being really sweet and caring then just blowing up over literally nothing.\n\nOver the past 6 months though, it has been becoming worse and worse. I've been starting to dread our ft conversations. Just recently, it was over a concert. We were going to see a concert end of November. Then my work told me I wouldn't be able to take that time off. It really sucked and I am completely heart broken over it, I mean, two of my favorite metal bands in one show?! UGH. Anyway, I was *dreading* to tell her this. When I finally did, her reaction was understanding. I was so relieved. Then came the passive aggressive remarks and gaslighting. Over the past few weeks, she has been passive aggressively saying how I am not trying to sell the tickets, or insinuating it's my fault we can't go. She has no idea how long it can take to sell tickets. If i bring this up to her she makes it seem like she has not been doing that, leaving me questioning myself.\n\nCurrently, she owes me $35 for me overnighting a phone to her. I asked her for it back the other day and she blew up on me. Telling me how I practically begged her to go to the concert and I begged her to pay my back. First off, she was just as excited as me to go to the concert and said she was 110% down, second of all, she owes me money? I also did not beg her for anything? \n\nAnyway, I am so done with her bullshit and the stress she adds in my life. I am trying so hard to better myself and gain the confidence I had before my ex narc. I want to completely take her out of my life but we are on the same phone plan. I have no idea what to do. Even if she apologizes, which she won't, I don't want her in my life.

TW: Imagine a broke, alcoholic, Christian Grey kind of guy who lives with his mom and was also (probably) after your money", "author": "CarefulFlatForm", "self_text": "Hi everyone,\n\nFirst post here. I got myself entangled in quite a predicament. I got involved with this guy for only 3 months but i think the effects of this \"relation-shit\" are gonna be with me for quite some time. I am in no way under impression that I didn't play my part in it by not working on things that allowed him to get his claws into me in the first place but...judge for yourself.\n\nWe got a new manager at work. At first, I thought...what a guy. How amazing his life seems, how fun, how exciting, how interesting. He seemed so charming, so helpful, so kind. He really put such a show at first and I bought into it, big time. So did everyone around me. His magnetic, larger than life personality shouldve been a warning.\n\nMonths passed by and me and my then bf ended up separating. My manager at the time, unbeknownst to me, was already (un?)conciously plotting his way into my life. He told me he noticed me from the moment he met me. Its hard to describe, i feel like I will never fully grasp the full extent of the mind games he played with me from the very start but i feel he was slowly inserting himself into my mind, into my life, step by step gaining my trust, getting to know my weaknesses and strengths, my secrets, hopes and dreams so he can adjust accordingly. I have a puppy and he offered himself to puppy sit, this is how he got the foot in the door. Professional boundaries? What is that? Thats for normies, he's above that of course.\n\n1 month into the breakup i walked into my own home and he made dinner for us. He never asked me out but he already sufficiently groomed me to find this literal trap non creepy. I went along with it. He said to me in a low, calm voice whilst looking at me directly in the eyes accompanied with a sly smile: \"I made you break up with your boyfriend:)...but you're in control, you can stop aaany time you want\", followed by a passionate make out session. My low self esteem took this as a boost, instead of a giant, bloody warning of the predatory nature of this person.\n\nHe accelerated the relationship incredibly. Talking kids, marriage, only weeks into it. But then...he's not gonna marry me. He's not sure if i can be fixed(projecting much?). He's afraid I will burden him. What an irony, coming from an almost 40 yearold alcoholic who lives with his parents and is almost a 100k in debt for a college degree he never finished while i moved away at 18 to a foreign country, am about to finish university and have lots stacked up due to combining work and university for the majority of the time. Might sound like I'm bragging but I'm just pissed he actually managed to make me believe those things even though all evidence points to the exact opposite.\n\nTroughout the relationship he was so good at making me belive things, its really quite something. He made me believe he's all this, that I need to compete for his attention and affection because he's so in demand, even going as far as to tell me he went on dates with other women (I asked them later, they got offended and said hell no he's not even my type). He slowly but surely started to make me believe that he has this amazing business idea and he only needs this much money and its guaranteed to work (his last one failed...) and he asked if id be willing to invest...after sex (when your mind is most susceptible to suggestion). Not to mention he started to make excuses to get his hands on my debit cards and pins (thankfully i only gave him the ones which have little money on it).\n\nHes really good at making himself the victim. Making people pity him, feel sorry for him. I feel for that thing in particular. By nature I'm very nurturing and want to help people so this is something that really drew me in.\n\nHe was also very persuasive sexually. I had some sexual trauma when i was younger and sex is a tricky subject for me. He made me think i had to obey his tempo and take things at his pace or else he will...walk away. We had a situation like this where he layed on top of me and put his hand on my mouth saying he needs to punish me(I get sick just thinking about it) and i freaked out and pushed him off and he proceed to stab me with words and proclaim \"then...Ill just go home\". He didnt get what he wanted and he pulled this move. I fell for it...i reached out for him. And never again was i to deny his sexual advances. He trained me very nicely, you see? He even went as far as to say i was already trained very well (I ran away from home because of that \"training\") but he saw it as a positive thing. I was already groomed for abuse, half of his job was already done.\n\nI also one time walked out of the bathroom to see him yell at the little puppy and proceed to chokeslam her to the bed for barking. The gentleman likes to assert his dominance...over helpless puppies.\n\nHe also had a thing for name calling and in general was obsessed with himself. He had full blown conversations with himself about anything and everything. He also went on long and aggressive rants about how he's gonna destroy people, ruin them psychologically, break them mentally. Its really sick.\n\nLast straw for me, thankfully, was him removing the condom during sex. He then proceeded to ignore me when i got angry over it, and then even got angry and went on a roughly 30 minute rant about how he's gonna break it off with me if i look for reasons to think such horrible things about him(yeah, i really need to look very hard....), how he knows I'm horribly jealous and insecure (the fact he acts in a way that makes you feel this way is not something he'd ever consider). I responded with \"yes I want a break\". I think it took him by surprise. I think he thought he had so much control over me id flinch and shut up by the thought of him abandoning me. He ended up telling me that night that he \"doesnt want to loose me\". In my mind, i gave him that hug but i thought \"I think you already did\". 2 days after i broke it off with him, at work.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat proceeded is something nobody coulve prepared me for. He kept on doing some mixture of ignoring me, attacking me, then being overly sweet and helpful at work. Giving presents. Making me look bad, making me look incredible. Begging for forgivness, saying he's going to therapy. Attacking me again. Getting frustrated because \"nothing was getting trough to me\"(=his old bag of tricks arent working anymore). We actually still work together, but of course I'm looking for a new job. He's also underperforming and i know from his boss that he's not getting a new contract.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe number of times i ended up sobbing in the bathroom is...considerable. What helped me is actually telling some of my coworkers what happend. Threatening him to go to HR if he doesnt keep it professional. Even still, i feel the subtile jabs or how he manages to pull my heartstrings. He can use his words as a weapon and is smart enough to be able to communicate with me \"trough other people\". Sometimes I'm afraid I'll break and go back to him. But I'm trying, I'm trying to break the spell he had me under, to see the truth of what happened and to learn, to grow and hopefully to never let anybody else wreck havoc in my life  and mind in  a way this guy did. He is a cautinary tale in more ways than one. A set of overpaid, painful lessons I had to learn when I wasnt really ready for it. He might have cost me my previous relationship(it was not a good one to begin with), 3 months of my life, no money but he didnt manage to break me down like it seems he did to his exes (his words, he ripped their heart out). He didnt manage to take my ability to think for myself. He didnt manage to brainwash me into thinking \"we\" got in this together and \"we\" screwed it up, together(accepting blame/responsibility? bitch please thats for adults). He didnt manage to convince me (fully) to be his sex slave. He hurt me, yes, many times but I'm adamant to put a stop to it.\n\n**He didnt get to own me.**\n\n**He'll never get a chance to control me ever again.** I'm writhing this to keep myself accountable for my actions. I am NOT going back. \n\nHe tells me his life is falling apart, his head is imploding due to the situation. How very strange that a loss of control over someone can make them so unhinged. He was not the most stable of all to begin with, but it seems gaining control over someone made him glow, made him feel better about his sorry-excuse-of- human-being-self. It fed his ego. I mean after all he is a \"lazy asshole\"(his words), its much easier to act like a parasite than to put the hard work and time to make something of yourself so you dont end up being bitter, resentful, full of self pity with your life out of control approaching mid life with almost nothing to show for it but a long, bloody trail of people youve hurt, disappointed, used and abused (all of this is according to him), countries you ran away from because you have to run away from yourself, responsibilities you've dodged, promises youve broken. In some way i do feel sorry for him. He is afraid he'll never be happy. For a good reason...if its never your fault you never learn, do you?\n\nAt the end...its all about him. Its his life story and i got caught up in it, and i suffered for it. I guess it coulve been worse. Ill count my blessings.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This is gonna be a long post, just fyi. I just want to be specific so I can convey the whole context of the situation.\n\nIn August of last year, I met my now ex girlfriend online. We were talking a lot, really hit it off, and in four days, she asked me to be her girlfriend. The first month of the relationship, some issues arose. For context, I have depression, anxiety, adhd and bpd, so I had a lot of emotional issues. She was overwhelmed by my issues, so I made changes in how I asked for support so we would have healthy boundaries. I would ask her if she had the spoons to support me, for instance, so if she didn't, I would get support elsewhere. What became an issue was a myriad of different things. First, we have very different energy levels. She'd visit me often because of a difficult home situation, but I'm also in a difficult home situation. Because my parents are abusive, and she has ptsd, she's scared of my parents, so when she'd visit, we'd be confined to my room until they went to bed or went out. Because of this, and the fact that we have very different energy levels, and I struggle getting out of bed due to my depression, whereas she's a morning person, there's a major conflict in how both of us functioned. That stressed her out a lot. I also tend to take out my frustrations on myself, which I've been working extremely hard on, so that stressed her out, as well. This is about when the daily criticisms began. I was stressing her out and I couldn't function like an adult, she said. So, I made more of an effort to change once that started, but the criticism was every day. \"You're incredibly stressful to be around and being with you is like babysitting a child\" and \"I noticed nobody ever taught you how to do (insert basic thing)\". This went on for months, as I'm trying to improve desperately, it wasn't really good enough. It continued, \"You're extremely stressful to be around and you clearly haven't matured\" and \"I don't get these issues with my friends, it's only you. You're extremely immature and I've never had to deal with this\" or \"all my other friends energize me and you drain me. I don't like going out and doing things with you because I'm too stressed and I feel like I'm babysitting you\". Her mental health was taking a turn, as well because of the stress as I'm trying hard to reduce it. She said she developed trauma from being with me. She compares me to her exes, and how they weren't as dysfunctional as I am., so I kept working on getting my issues better because seeing her hurting was incredibly difficult. \"You hurt me\", she told me. I apologised and committed to changing. She was telling me these things every day, still. It turned into \"You're hurting the people you love\", then to \"You're hurting everybody around you\". I know I was insecure about my friends liking me, so she told me that it's likely because they see that I'm unstable that they don't want to be around me. She'd sometimes apologise for having to say these things to me and I always validated her feelings by saying \"It needed to be said and your feelings are completely valid\"\n\nThings continued to get worse, however. She acknowledges that I have gotten better but it's been too little too late. She said I'm too childlike and that my issues were something you'd expect from a child or adolescent rather than someone in their twenties. She talked about how she wasted a year of her life with me and she should kill herself. I'd honestly been so torn as to what to do I just... I was just lost...Every day was a conversation about how dysfunctional I am and how it stresses her out and how I'm like a child and I'm essentially paralyzed by guilt each and every day. It got to the point where any time i'm slightly upset, it triggers her, so when she'd give me these talks every day, she'd read how I'm feeling guilty even though I'm trying to hide it because of fear. The whole relationship, I have always been afraid to speak my mind. She'd tell me things like \"even the most mentally healthy people in the world would be destroyed by you\" and \"Nobody else has been as close to you as I have so they don't experience what I do\".\n\nThe fact of the matter is, I've been very close to quite a few people. I haven't been any different with her than I had been with anybody else and nobody else has said these things. Whenever she's around, I feel worse, my mental health gets worse, I get scared and I'm basically waiting to see what else I'm doing wrong because I'm finding that I am in fact doing everything wrong... Like, the way I dress, I look like a mentally ill homeless person which is why she's afraid to go out and about with me, along with the stress. I'm the root cause of all the issues in the relationship so I need to take full responsibility for that. The few times I tried to explain my side of things, she got extremely angry at me, and said I was selfish, toxic and I was trying to shift blame on to her. The truth is, I've had a great deal of pain which I've hid from her out of fear of retaliation, just as she's hid things from me out of fear of making me feel bad. Like, I'll be talking about something that makes me happy or I'm excited about, and she'll insert a reason why she's not excited about it or she'll take something I said and segue it into how I've made her life hell.\n\nI'm really conflicted here. This is the most difficult situation I've ever dealt with in my entire life and I don't know what to do or think. I don't trust my own perspective on things so I look at things through her eyes because I find that much more trustworthy because, and she's said it herself, that with my BPD, I'll tend to see things differently than they actually are and I'll assume I'm being attacked when she's bringing up these difficult subjects, so I don't know... Who's in the wrong here? Is either of us being abused? What's going on?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

C not taking into account J's feelings, wants, and needs, instead making it all about her. Like a few days ago J told C he wanted to legally adopt a family friend who was orphaned rather recently (family friend is 13, J is 25) and C absolutely threw a fit and started hurting herself, absolutely refusing to let him go through with it because she was worried she wouldn't be the center of attention anymore (even though she admitted she wants kids soon so it makes no sense)(also keep in mind, this is just a basic relationship at this point, C and J arent married or even engaged at this point).\n\n3. C is always overly clingy and is extremely jealous when theres nothing to be jealous about. Such as J no longer being allowed to have girls numbers in his phone (even his mothers) and barely being allowed to have any female friends on Facebook otherwise C goes ballistic. \n\n4. Finally the biggest one is that C guilt trips J and blackmails him. If J even says he just wants to take a break from the relationship (not even break up for good, just take like a week or 2 break) C will threaten to kill herself or even actually attempt to do so.\n\nI keep trying to make J see that this is not a healthy relationship at all but he keeps saying \"ive never felt this way about someone before\" (he has trouble feeling most emotions so him actually feeling someting is a big deal) and hes convinced that because he actually feels something, that C MUST be the one and hes afraid to let that go.

Two weeks after starting our relationship, he said he wanted to be a husband and a father. Fence-sitter (leaning to childfree) as I was, it gave me the creeps, but I thought, \"what the heck, maybe in two years I will want children\". He gave me an ultimatum. If I didn't want children, he would end the relationship. I was already in love with him, so I didn't say I didn't even like children.\n\nHis sister (who lived in the apartment next door) had a baby that same year. You can't imagine the pressure I suffered from his whole family. They were obsessed with babies. My MIL often asked me if I liked children, when were we going to have children, etc. I didn't pay much attention to the baby and I know that bothered my in-laws and my BF. He said that, when (not if) we had children, we would take them everywhere with us. I disagreed, and I said that parents needed a rest sometimes to go out to dinner, take a trip, etc. He also insisted that I should breastfeed, and I put my foot down. I said I refused to breastfeed, I would choose the bottle, so that he also could feed the baby. I didn't want to have a baby hanging off my tit for a year. He said I was very selfish, that breast milk was the best thing.\n\nHe worked as a pediatrician for a while, although he was a GP, and those months I found that he was even more obsessed with children, he was talking of children all the time. His parents (whose 36-year-old daughter had died eight years before, after giving birth, oddly enough) were also obsessed with babies, they were talking about children all the time. My sister-in-law used to share photos of her breastfeeding in one different cafeteria each week, which freaked me out. I knew that I would always be the selfish mother that didn't want to breastfeed, unlike my perfect SIL, who breastfed on demand.\n\nWhen my BF broke up with me, I told him that I didn't want children anyway, so we were right to break up. He said I would end up alone (how nice). \n\nAnd now I wonder what my life would be now if I had had children with him. I would be stuck with children I didn't want to have, I would have been attached to my narc my whole life, whether I liked it or not,  he would have made me feel guilty all the time about my parenting and, what is worst, he would have used the children as supply for his narcissism.\n\nI really dodged a bullet there.

Over this past year, I've felt my passions float away like clouds and I'm confused all of the time. Each week, I'd come to my therapist stressing about a different version of the same thing: I feel foggy and insecure in the classroom. As I try to speak up in class, I stop myself short of saying what I would like to. This triggers feelings of emptiness and worthlessness. There's a constant thread within me asking whether I know what I know. I imagine a lot of my classmates probably feel varying levels of imposter syndrome, but I'm aware that this issue I'm having is larger.\n\nMy conversations with my therapist tend to move in and out of my current experiences and my childhood, but like clockwork, my mind always wants to take me to my relationship (that I'm still in). I think today I'm willing to accept that I've been dating a narc for two years. And that he's my third narc to date. And I need some advice on leaving gracefully (if that's at all possible) because my past two break-ups were both explosive and frightening for me.\n\nI check a ton of the boxes of a codependent partner and my therapist has been nudging me toward this thought for a while. She's called my experiences with my current boyfriend abuse (e.g., ignoring the needs I express, turning my words against me, commenting on my reactions, telling me I'm making things up, telling me all of the things he hates about my friends, inventing crises in our relationship, making small jokes about my appearance, making me jealous by telling me about the guys who slide into his DMs). I've poo-pooed the idea for a while saying: \"I know he loves me, and even if this is abuse, he doesn't know he's doing it. He can change.\" But he and I have had the conversation about his behavior one too many times as of a few days ago and I've gotta get out of this hell.\n\nI'm currently away at a conference with some time to myself, but before leaving we had an episode that gave me all of the information I needed. Two nights ago while we were both at home, I cried to him about how I feel inadequate in my program. Rather than hug me (as I gently asked him to do) he prodded me with questions, told me I manufacture problems, and looked at me with a furrowed brow. I sobbed and raised my voice to tell him to stop-- all the while aware that he was causing the tears. He then initiated sex...and I asked to cuddle instead. He continued to try, and I eventually cut it off to go see my therapist (great timing). I was in a fog during and after that session. The next morning I receive a text after he had already left for work telling me that he was annoyed with me for being emotional and also for making eyes at the Whole Foods sandwich maker while we were getting dinner later that night (WTF?). In his text, he asked if I thought we were on good terms that night, to which I replied, \"yes, I did not see this coming.\" He then initiated a \"break\" until I return in a few days. Not sure if it was the sex-after-crying or the eyes-on-the-sandwich-guy that did it for me, but I want him out of my apartment at the very least.\n\nDoes anyone have advice for ending these relationships in a graceful way?

I was sexually abused by a male family member. It was around that time that I think she stopped actually trying to listen to us. I tried telling her multiple times about what he was doing, but she always made up excuses and didn't ever believe me until I broke down and wanted him to leave. We did all legal things that were necessary, moved, and I continued therapy (which she put me in bc she thought I had severe issues with a father figure of mine).

I remember having to watch them since I was around 10 years old. I prevented my brother from falling down the stairs multiple times. I'm the one who calms down my siblings since she doesn't know how. I use Spanish and ASL to calm my young brother down, and I talk to my sister to calm her down. We fight a bit, and during those fights she pushed me, got mad when I didn't cry and accused me of giving attitude, and said I need to stop causing problems. She also accused me of - excuse my language (slur warning) - inviting a whole bunch of tr\\*nnies over. She also just recently broke up with her boyfriend of two years who was messed up in the head. He was suicidal and had severe bipolar. Mom always said that if we were uncomfortable with her bf, we could tell her and she would make him leave since \"kids are most important\". I told her multiple times that the next time he leaves, he stays gone. That this back-and-forth shit has been messing with everyone's mental health. She agreed that he would stay gone, but the next morning he's back and allowed to stay. Recently she said that they are actually done, but I keep having dreams that he came back. Yes, he's a wonderful person, but God I can't deal with his problems anymore. She also slapped him out of anger multiple times during the fights where he leaves. She also promised multiple times she would stop smoking as it affects my asthma and makes me nauseous. She still hasn't after 3 promises that she would. I try to tell her multiple times that she needs to try therapy again, as she has gotten bad with her anger. She said \"it doesn't work for me\". I asked when the last time she tried it was. She said it's none of my business. She also throws a sorta pity party for herself when I bring up her bf, \"I'll just never date anyone again, is that what you want\" One time when she was mad, she grabbed my brother who started crying and repeated \"don't throw me\".\n\nI try my best to have adult conversations with her but she always gets mad because it's about things she does. She says I can talk to her about anything, but at this point I'm so done. I'm tired of not being listened to. I'm tired of all the cleaning and her getting upset when it isn't done right. I'm tired of her saying \"do this, do that\" and get upset when I \"don't know how to be a kid\".\n\nI'm very sorry for the essay, but I wanted to know if I'm overreacting about her actions.

He would see me talking to a guy friend, grab me, and pull me away and say why do you keep walking away from me and just stare at me intensely whenever we were out. \n\nOther times, when I hurt myself accidentally he would be so gentle with me ...\n\nEDIT: I really appreciate all of these comments.

I\u2019m still in a fog and I really hope no one else stays in any situation like this.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

If I wasn't, he would take it as a personal affront and an attack at his \"boyfriend qualities\". He believed that it was is a boyfriend's duty to make their woman happy, so whenever I wasn't happy with anything I was automatically criticizing him - in his logic - because I refused to be made happy by him. That made it my duty to always be happy if I didn't want to \"start a fight\" - something that is really hard to do when you start struggling with depression due to these expectations. He said, he only wanted to see me happy and that couldn't be a bad thing... \n\nThere was a couple that we were friends with. Shortly before we broke up, they told me that they didn't want to have me there at an event that lasted 5 days - and where 100 people would be - because I knew it would be challenging for me and therefore they would have to be worried about me and could not enjoy their time. I was so taken aback by that. I had never voiced any expectations to them that would make them feel like my happiness was their responsibility. I was deeply hurt by this. My nex told me that I should be understanding of them since that event was so important to them and that I should concentrate on the positive part of the message: that they worry about me. This would mean that they cared about me. \n\nBack then already I saw it differently (I felt rejected) and that - in the end - led to us breaking up.\n\nThat was 2 years and 3 months ago. Since then I didn't know how to describe my fears of what would be happening when people said they liked me, other that \"fear of rejection\" - even though that did not feel right, because I don't fear clear rejection. If someone simply tells/shows me that they don't like me, I have no problem with that. \n\nIn the past few days I reflected on that again and I realized something: I don't fear rejection in itself. I fear conditioned acceptance - and I think that's something narcs love to do.\n\nBecause that pushes the responsibility for being accepted to you. If you behave in a way that does not make them uncomfortable, you are welcomed with open arms - but only then. So, if you are rejected it is your own fault. So, if you dare to be human and have needs that would need them to change anything about their plans, that makes it your fault if they don't like that. They basically tell you that you have the power to control their feelings towards you and that therefore you are responsible for their feelings. While in reality that gives them the ultimate power to decide what they expect from you. \n\nAnd they attach impossible to fulfill conditions to that.\n\nAnd they make it seem like it was acceptance and love that they show you while in reality they reject everything about you that makes you human.\n\nAnd I still find myself fearing that conditioned acceptance/rejection. With almost everybody in my life I have the feeling that I need to \"perform well\" in order to deserve love and consideration. I feel like I need to make sure noone ever feels uncomfortable because of me.\n\nAt least I now do have a few people who show me that they don't fear a little discomfort and that they actually appreciate the possibility to learn something new or to show me that they care about me. \n\nI think these are the people we need to surround ourselves with.\n\nEdit: wow.

We were quite tight-knit community within boundaries of how close an online community can be. Over time people started distancing themselves from me for no reason and I started feeling... without anything being said to me directly... subtly criticised and that people were more negative towards me. I dismissed those without clear proof of this (especially acknowledging my family background might have made me assume things subconsciously), but it just got worse.\n\nThe narc friend got closer to me while others were pulling away. The first red flags which I saw and felt uncomfortable about, but ignored as \"probably normal human differences\" was when a few people I wasn't too familiar with started putting me down for agreeing with the narc friend about her opinion. Like I was just echoing the friend with nothing to say on my own, but I didn't feel need to repeat what was already being said. When the narc friend pulled me into her circle and some social hostilities convinced me that I'm not liked by anyone else anymore, things got... a lot worse.\n\nShe started dominating all conversations between me and others... or attempted to. I called her out of many things, like her friend asking me a question, the narc friend rushed to answer to her question instead of letting me answer myself. \"I can speak for myself\" I stated firmly and that caused the narc friend start huge drama, mostly guilt trip or just dismissing my emotions. I felt so dissed, but when I said I'd cut her off if she doesn't treat me as an equal, she'd pull me back with apologies and pity parties. But she didn't change her behavior. Another thing was, not letting me to pick subjects to talk about among friends. She needed to be the one doing that or her \"social leadership\" was questioned... This just went on and on with many different forms of mind games to convert me into her pawn, until I finally got too tired of constant drama and cut them all off. Now, I've been conditioned to \"formally agree\" to avoid drama while normally I'd stick to my choices and opinions even if it meant risk of drama.. I feel dead inside for not being able to safely express myself.\n\nWhy don't I feel safe socially? The narc friend used 3rd parties to slowly pull me in and even while I cut her off years ago, I have had a feeling she wouldn't let go that easily. I'm prepared for hoovering and all things personal, but can't do much if she uses her social media influencer friends to slander me or destroy my opportunities to get a better life. People who have useful contacts thrive socially, but myself, I'm an introvert thus I don't have lots of energy to seek and maintain social contacts, especially if they were just to \"look out for me in case of narcs\" (but not to protect, I don't want a rescuer or savior - I strive to learn how to protect myself eventually and let people stand with me as equals). I've tried to be responsible and morally good person in order to not give bad people more fodder to attack me, but nowadays people don't really care how good you are, they only seem to care if you benefit them somehow. And if this happened once, it can happen again. I heard some people are even hospitalised by constant attacks and false alarms from narcs and their flying monkeys, and the law enforcement + nurses/doctors had even believed narcs. I even feel that to fight narcs and maintain my freedom (instead of being punished for crimes I havent even committed), I gotta become like the narcs. To learn how to manipulate and twist people to have my way, if they would let the narc overwhelm you otherwise. And I'm sort of tired of keeping detailed lists about every damn thing in my life in order to prove external parties like law enforcement etc I'm not the dysfunctional and ill-willing one here, but just trying to live my damn life like everyone else does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis may sound like I'm just being a paranoid but knowledge and my damn gut tell me otherwise. If I had solid proof of this aside from subtle signs (which even I doubt as bad memories and over-caution sometimes), I'd report her and her flying monkeys to law enforcement. But she knows to minimise risks of being caught of her manipulations before it gets overwhelming.

I just really wanna tell my full story of growing up with abuse, sexual, physical and mental. I'm sorry if this is alot of some people but I really need to get it out. If you're going through anything like this please contact me.\n\nOkay now let's start\n\n\nSome background on my family\n\ndad is a psychopath and has depression and PTSD\n\nmom has PTSD\n\nSister 1 has bipolar tip 2 and PTSD\n\nSister 2 has bipolar tip 1 PTSD\n\nSister 3 has OCD og anger issues\u00a0\n\nBrother has anger issues and some other things (I don't know what they are)\n\nI have borderline, anxiety, PTSD and depression\n\n\nSo we all have mental health issues\n\n\nI has born in country 1 (where mom is from) and at the age of 3, we moved to country 2 (where dad is from).\n\ndad has been abusive since before I was born, he abused mom and sisters, he would bet them almost to death.\u00a0\n\n\nBut now to my story.\n\n\nSince I was born dad acted like I was a boy, he didn't want a girl so I was kinda raised like a boy.\u00a0\n\nSo I didn't really get abused as much as my sisters, since he saw me as a boy, and this is probably way I'm so masculine today, but then I got into the age of 6 and started showing that I was a girl, it got bad, he would bet me and lock me in a room for days with almost no food or anything to drink. He would tell me it was to teach me to be the good boy I am.\n\n\nAt the age of 7 (maybe earlier I don't remember). Brother started abusing me sexual, physical and mentally. In the start I thought it was normal, I didn't really think it was wrong. Since that is what he told me, and my family didn't ever talk about sex or anything like that, because of beliefs. He would abuse me at the most once a month since he lived in country 1, so it would only be when he was on vacation. This want on for about 4 years.\n\n\nBut than we had to move to country 1 because if war, meaning I had to live with brother, when we came he didn't do it because we were all living in one room, I thought the abuse was over, I was wrong.\n\n\nAfter a few months we moved to an apartment me, all my siblings and mom. And the abuse got so much worse, it went from once a month to everyday.\n\n\nWhat is being writing now is not for the light hearted!!! So don't read it if you can't take deals of abuse\n\n\nHe would tell me that I was his, that he owned me, what I was to do everything he wanted and it was his right. He would touch every time he had a chance. He did rap me once but it's so hard for me to talk about, so I'm not gonna. He would touch himself in front of me, saying I know you want it. And said I should be a cam-girl, because guys like him, would love to say a ung body since girls his age body's are ugly and old (he was 21 to 24 at this time).\n\n\n\u00a0At 16 I finally got the courage to tell one of my sisters, which forced me to tell mom. It went pretty well, but having to tell the person who gave birth to both of you (the abuser and the victim) isn't the easiest thing. She ended up sending him an email, saying to never contact her again and stay out of our lives, and that she couldn't believe what he has done to me. At this time mom also asked me to not go to the police, so he could still have a normal life, and I agree to this, (stupidly enough).\u00a0\n\n\nFast forward a few days, I ended up telling one if my teacher in school what had happened, not knowing she would go to the authorities, she was one of the people in my life at the time, that helped me through stuff, since I was suffering from sincere anxiety. (Some of my friends also knew for a while at this time about 2 years, but we will come to that later).\u00a0\n\n\nAbout 2 weeks after telling the teacher, everything was going good at school and home, I was a lot happier and finally felt free. But one day my teacher came to the classroom and asked me to come with her to the office because we had to talk (a normal thing we did). When we got there she just put her hand on my shoulder and said \"I'm sorry\". I turned to look inside the room and there was two officers sitting there. I started crying, thinking that mom would hate me. Long story short, they interviewed me recording the whole thing, and two other women were in the room who work for the city and they took me with them and brother got arrested.\u00a0\n\nthey ended up calling mom from this holding house that I was in. mom walked in the room she didn't even want to look at me or sit beside me.\u00a0\n\n\nFast forward a few months we were going to court. I lost my case I'm not going to go into detail why, but the main reason was lack of evidence. At the same time this whole thing was going on I was extremely depressed and had tried multiple attempts to take my life, I'm better now but I do suffer from a lot of mental illness because of this. mom and sisters still talk to him and see him which really makes me feel like that they don't believe me. I don't know what to do, they keep telling me that I cannot expect them to cut him out of their lives, and that I should just get over it as start coping like they did, he deserves a family too and that I'm overreacting. This is really overwhelming, and makes me feel not welcome in my own house, and that's my family doesn't believe me and doesn't want me in their lives. There is been multiple times where I have seen him on accident because of my family's doing. (By the way my brother is 8 years older than me)\n\n\nThank you for reading", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I couldn\u2019t figure out why this great relationship (love bomb) suddenly (devalue) ended (discard). Thank you to everyone who posts and comments here. I learned so much from all of your stories and experiences that what happened to me was classic narc abuse and I fell for it. I feel like I need to sit down even though I already am. I really didn\u2019t think my ex was at all responsible for our ending. I thought it was my fault the relationship ended. I even broke NC to take responsibility and apologize as I would have wanted someone to do for me. I honestly would have preferred to think it was me than to figure out that I was being manipulated. This sense of relief is also simultaneously sickening, so I have some major ambivalence.\n\nIt really all was a lie. From the very jump. I feel like such an idiot. I\u2019m 5 months post break up and have been NC since about a month post break up. I was in such a low place and I took all the blame. I\u2019m doing much better now, but holy fuck is this a punch to the gut. I guess I have more to process with my therapist. I had made peace with everything, but couldn\u2019t explain the sudden personality shift from her at the end. Why she would forget things that were important to me.  Why it was my fault that she did? Why she would \u201cjoke\u201d about me lying about her agreeing to come to an important event? Why she would guilt me for needing time to process the grief of the death of a loved one as opposed to focusing my attention on her. Why she expressed \u201cconcern\u201d that I communicated needing space, because I was hurting and upset and needed to gather my thoughts about the relationship while mourning and did not want to come off as distant or cruel. Why she showed up at my house and made accusations for things she interpreted negatively. Why she went back on initial apologies. Why she doubled down on her unkind and unloving actions. Why she wanted to repair things until she could find fault in a minor mistake I made. I looked past that behavior, because we were going to build a family (I am estranged from mine) she talked about her belief that her family would accept me (lesbian relationship) and I could help her belong better in her own family. She talked about us getting married/ moving in together. Maybe even kids. It all happened so fast and I fucking fell for it. I was grieving and work in a difficult field so had a lot of stress. She took care of me when I was sick and then relied on me to care for her when she was. I finally found that connection and relationship I gave up so much for. But it was all bullshit. None of it was real, was it? She never cared for me. And if this is true then were my feelings real? Or were they just the result of manipulation/ love bombing? I guess I finally know why the last thing she said to me after we agreed to part ways was, \u201cI thought about it last night and I realized I could never love you\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I cannot trust you\u201d. \n\nAt any rate, thanks again everyone for your insight and reading my ramblings.

I left her earlier this year, but came back to her believing she was serious about couple's therapy this time. Of course after I came back, she changed her commitment with therapy, and said we do not need it. Then she resorts back to the same shit: gas lighting, blame-shifting, stonewalling, control, manipulation, narc rage, etc.\n\nBecause there is core shame in her narcissism, she has moments that I believe she regrets her behavior and then consequently questions that I do not really love her. Why, of course? Because she does not fundamentally love herself, and her own shitty behavior. But she cannot break free from the cognitive dissonance and do anything meaningful about it.\n\nBut I digress, my point is that she would also ask me the same question much earlier before I left her temporarily earlier this year. In fact, it started about six months after our wedding. She would start to skeptically say that I must not love her because otherwise I would do ( ..... fill in the blank). It is always conditional. The expectations are always arbitrary of me, etc.\n\nDoes anyone else have to constantly reassure their narc partner that you love them?

I've been reading on Reddit for quite a while. Trying to build on advice given to others to try and improve my situation, but I am at my wit's end. I need to get out of my he. My father has been abusing me for years. Along time ago he would get trashes and hit my mom, my brother, or me. When I was 10 the night before Valentine's day, he went overboard and stepped on my chest, causing my mother to relocate my brother and me to her mother. She didn't like struggling as a single mom and went privileges back to my father who also happened to be her teenage love. I resisted returning to the family so they arranged to allow me to stay with my grandmother and stay in school. I thrived without my Father, participated in sports, had friends, I was happy. Upon receiving the news my parents were coming to retrieve us (my brother and I), I lost it. I was so desperate to stay away from him, I tried killing myself. I confided to the hospital what happened and they called my father. He denied all my claims and my mother backed him up, and they later contacted me in the hospital claiming the doctor told them I faked it. I was devastated. They made my grandmother take away all technology and privileges to attempt to isolate me. I was dying mentally. I had nightmares of that night over and over. Despite this life went on and I was forced to move back in with my parents. They made jokes about my attempt, joked about the abortion they should've had, the dog they should have gotten instead. I was in shambles. I lost myself, but it only got worst. My father was Better! He would never lay a hand on my mother! Oh no, he would only complain about every mistake she made. He didn't beat my brother anymore! He didn't even beat me for a bit. Instead the jokes about my body, my mental health, my inability to do the chores to his liking. This was all I had to endure until he realized that after I experienced what real life was like that I was no longer going to be a mindless robot in his home as my brother. I was angry instead. He would joke about how in the ward, we weren't allowed strings and I would fire right back. He started taking away my phone for a week at a time. Going through it, texting friends and pretending to be me. Eventually, we moved again for his job and he decided in the state I was in, it wasn't safe for me to have access to the internet outside of school. He took away my phone and destroyed it with my brother right in front of me. They made me write lines when I stood up for myself. Beat me when a dish wasn't properly cleaned, I forgot to put his tools in his car, woke up a few minutes late, didn't clean the bathroom the way he wanted. I was no longer allowed technology. His default to punishing me was to hit me or take away more. He banned me from talking to my closest friends at school and would have my brother spy on me. Eventually, I was given all the duties in the house. I would clean, and clean to avoid being beaten. I would hide his belt and dread the weekend where I couldn't escape to school. We moved again, but this time I had acquired a secret phone. It was my comfort when he sent me outside in the rain to use my hands to move all the rocks by the road, or to pick up all the dirt in his car by hand. I was not allowed to wear jeans my dad didn't like, my hair was cut every year the same, no makeup was allowed. At night, I would watch videos, and I had social media! For a few hours, i was free. How sinful of me. He caught me eventually. One night, I was snuggled under the covers happily talking to old friends. He saw the light. I was 14 at the time. He took my phone, went through it, and in the morning woke me up and beat me in front of my brother. He sent me outside in the middle of winter with only a long sleeve shirt and sandals to clean the chicken coop while he decided what to do with me. He gave me a broom and insisted he wanted me to pick up every leave off the ground. He would bring me inside every two hours to spank me with a belt. My mom joined in eventually and she went through the phone to see that I, a teenage girl, had spoken to boys. Then to her dismay, that I was into girls. They sold the phone in front of me into a mobile selling machine. Bought a bottle of soap with the little money they received for it. They pulled my room apart and threw away everything they thought i didn't deserve. Finally it was time for school again and I was thankful. I was a slave at home, but at school, I was funny and popular and I met my best friend. I acquired a new phone through him, and I got better. I used the little bit of money I had to get therapy through an app because I knew I was clinically depressed and wanted to die. He caught me through my brother who snitched on me for money. I received 58 spankings with a construction broom handle in my underwear and I was banned from leaving the house. I wasn't allowed to sit on my own on the bus. Not allowed to be in my room with the door closed. The lock was flipped so that I could be locked inside. I spiraled again and I dreaded going home every day. He would search me like a prisoner, they stopped using my name and called me \"bad minion\" no one belived me, if something went wrong, I was punished. He told me I would go to hell, how he didn't want me. Summer came and they pulled me from school. They took away my last escape. I would be forced to travel to a hotel with them for work where I would spend every day in the small room, doing their every need, attending school online, sleeping on the floor at night. I was ready to die. I thought if I did badly in school, they would HAVE to put me in regular school, I was so lonely. They didn't. I was beaten for doing badly. Punished and forced to do push-ups in the hotel until I threw up. I was utterly alone. I figured out a way around them and purchased a secret phone and talked to my best friend every day. They found it and my father beat me in my underwear. Forced me to climb on the roof and stand near the edge (terrified of heights ), shot me with metal bb gun pellets and cut up my clothes with a knife. Humiliated me. I'm still in online school and still utterly lonely. My best friend has cut off contact in favor of his mental health because he couldn't help me and his girlfriend was jealous of me. I'm 16 now, and I need advice on leaving. I'm allowed a phone now, and access to the internet, even was allowed a job for a bit, but I'm still the household maid. I endure thousands of hateful words every week and I'm struggling under Junior year stress and doing everything for my parents. I need to get out. I even have a place to run too. But I need help. I need advice on things I should prepare, ways to save up money. I'm in South Dakota with my parents and this is my only chance to escape back to North Dakota. If we return home to Texas, I won't be able to go on. Any advice or help with rules or laws that can help with the emancipation of a child without parental consent would help. Any advice from past runaways would also help. I beg for advice and ideas while planning my way out. I've worked so hard in my short life and I do not want to live like this anymore. A house so strict that I can't even cross my legs with I sit down is no house for me. I don't want to hurt my mother in any way other than leaving. I will not report them for her sake.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I just want to thank all of you for the comments. I'm very thankful and I've been replying as I can but there's been a bit of an update. My father has banned me from getting a job here, but he's allowing me to go work for my brother. Is there an app or maybe a system I can use to transfer hidden money? I have a way to buy a bus ticket but I'm only able to manage my money online.

She keeps me on a tight leash, so I don't spend any more time on-campus then I have to for school, and I don't have any friends or socialize with anyone at school. That said, I go to a small liberal arts college so I still know lots of people despite not spending much out-of-class time with them.\n\nMy girlfriend is particularly angry that I am connected to so many girls.

If I don't delete my account in the next few hours, she says she will not see me tonight or for the rest of the weekend.

My whole life has been turned upside down, and my days are filled with grief and panic attacks. Apologies in advance for the length. Thanks for being here so I can put this  story somewhere.\n\nHere's what happened.\n\nI worked for my boss for fifteen years. For the first thirteen, I was a favourite.\n\nI didn't report directly to her at first, so I had a limited perspective of her. I knew lots of people loathed her, but I bought the reasoning that those people just didn't like hard work or change, and couldn't cope with a strong woman leader with a bold vision. My boss is socially awkward, she's stiff and formal, and people fear her and are uncomfortable around her. I know she is naturally shy and is working hard to put on the mantle of leader, so I chalked it up to that. I was sure she always meant well.\n\nWhen my boss was recruited elsewhere, she created a job for me so I could follow her. I did a tremendous amount of work helping to smooth over the edges of her introduction to the new organization.\n\nA year in, I was strongly encouraged to apply for a major promotion: a role on my boss's immediate team, with a huge portfolio to direct. I interviewed for it and got it, with the generous support of the rest of the organization. My boss told me that having a team is complicated: she is a different person depending on who she meets with. She isn't sure she knows who she really is. I had no idea what she meant, but I sympathized that it must be hard, but it was good of her to flex like that for the benefit of others.\n\nI wonder if I should have understood that confession differently than I did.\n\nMy boss told me that her immediate team was dysfunctional, and she didn't know why. I figured out why pretty quickly: she pitted us against once another, cycled through us with blame her for own mistakes, humiliated us in meetings, put us on blast for the smallest mistakes, questioned the judgment of anyone who didn't immediately agree with her or do things her way, and used information from private meetings with each of us, word for word,  to target and abuse the rest. She used members of our teams, the motivated favourites who didn't report to her, to spy on the rest of the organization, including on us. I was hugely disappointed. Her behaviour went against everything she had always told me she believed in, things I believe in as well.\n\nI should have realized what was going on. But I chose to believe that she is human and struggling. I have always been there to help her to enact her vision, so I was there to help her with this, too.\n\nShe gave me a raise six months into the role for being so unexpectedly good at it. She was sure I would be a weak, less than competent leader who would require a lot of assistance from her, but I didn't.\n\nBut things were not rosy. You can't be a favourite for long on her immediate team. We bear the weight of her own guilt and gross feelings, we are always the reason she makes mistakes, even when we have nothing to do with it. If we have ideas or suggestions of our own, we are problems. She asked me not to bring her ideas or projects she'd have to say no to. She only wants to see her own ideas reflected back at her.\n\nAfter she had viciously torn me apart in front of my peers in a group meeting, she told me privately that I needed to learn to accept feedback better. I was \"too sensitive.\" I told her that feedback isn't the problem, the humiliation of the delivery in front of my peers is. I told her that she makes it hard for us to be a functional team because no one wants to work with the person with the \"bad judgment\" who's clearly on her naughty list. We can't be a team when we're hiding behind each other in the hopes of not being the one in the hot seat.\n\nShe handled the criticism really well in the moment, and thanked me for sharing it. I thought I'd done a good thing. I was impressed with her reaction and hoped I could do the same when my own team had criticism of me. I was certain that she really was the great leader I thought she was.\n\nI'd been reliably admiring her for thirteen years. For me to \"betray\" her like this cut her very deeply, and I know she worked it through with her therapist. But her therapist agreed with me, which I think made it worse. She tried to stop releasing her anger at us in meetings, with limited success. I think it made her lose her footing entirely.\n\nI was told sideways to stop praising my direct reports during our meetings. I was confused as to why. It is profoundly unnatural to me not to say so when great work is right in front of us. I was told that I was making my peers feel badly about their own teams, which made no sense to me. Their teams are terrific too! It's not a zero sum game! So instead of no longer pointing out great ideas and great work from my own team, I made a point of praising good ideas and good work regardless of whose team it came from. It wasn't hard to do: there are a lot of smart, thoughtful people in the organization doing great things.\n\nI now realize that it probably wasn't my peers complaining about my praising the work of our staff. It was a good friend and \"coach\" of my boss's who told me to stop. I was praising others while pointedly not praising my boss.\n\nThen I learned about the constant shit-talking. I had no idea my boss did so much shit-talking. She goes into these trance-like rages and says the most horrific things about people who work in the organization, just awful stuff. I was appalled, and immediately resolved to help the staff she spoke about like this. I fought her shit-talking, I argued with her about her evaluations of them, politely and respectfully, of course. I felt I owed it to these people who were doing their best, and to my own sense of right and wrong.\n\nMy boss told me that it was a performance issue on my part that I didn't just agree with her. She needs me to agree with her, and my job is to support her. I told her that the negative talk is hard for me, it stays with me when I'm working with our staff. She was so horrified; I had just called out her shit-talking, and apparently no one does that. It didn't occur to me that that was a revelation. She said her shit-talking doesn't mean anything, it's just venting. I said it meant a lot to me. I said it was burned into my brain.\n\nOnce again, her therapist agreed with me wholeheartedly. My boss tried to stop the shit-talking, but she couldn't. At one point, she told us that she doesn't know how to do her job anymore because we have all these *feelings* and she has to be careful of them and it's limiting for her. She doesn't want to be careful, she just wants to put her own feelings on blast and have us just take it, like it's *our job* to do.\n\nAt this point, she was ignoring most of what I said her in our meetings. She seemed to forget every agreement or decision we made, or critical elements of work that I shared with her. This is all very new to me, and I was concerned about her health. I started to document everything I told her. When she swore up and down that I was going behind her back and didn't tell her something, I gave her the minutes of the meeting where I did. Her assistant tells me she's always been like this, she forgets things all the time. She's never, ever forgotten something I've told her before.\n\nI was trying to get work done, but she wouldn't give me any back up. The people who run the systems who supported my teams weren't being encouraged to pay any attention to our requests. Critical elements are deprioritized. My own staff were being reassigned to other projects with no back up. Projects start to fail. I waved all the red flags in every way I could, but I couldn't solve big pieces of it without support from other units, and therefore from her. I'm not used to working without her support, it seemed impossible to me. When I called time because some big element is failing that I had no control over, the conversation started again at the beginning. Am I right about this? Probably not. Maybe we don't need that big element at all. It all goes philosophical and nothing changes. She repeatedly accused me of trying to manipulate her. Projects stalled and failed because she thought I was asking for support for something to secretly get some other thing she hadn't approved. I was confused and perplexed, and seriously questioning whether I *was* trying to manipulate her. Why would she think so otherwise?\n\nAfter a couple of years of this, a big project stumbled pretty badly. Not a big surprise: it was missing every critical piece that made it work. We did our best, but it was rocky. She was livid with me for failing to meet her stated expectations, and I felt horrible, horrible about it. I accepted all the blame for failing. Surely I could have done better. I panicked in the end. I could have communicated better. I could have stayed in better control. But my job was safe, she told me. It was just my wild imagination leading me to think it might not be. That was less than a month ago.\n\nMeanwhile, she's lined up and promoted her new favourite.\n\nJust over three weeks ago she decided to demote me from a permanent, upper level leadership role to a short term contract, strip me of my direct reports, reduce my salary, and have me out permanently by summer. I'm too optimistic, too naive, too positive, too sensitive and unable to accept feedback or criticism, and just not leadership material. There's no place for me here.\n\nI was just discarded, wasn't I.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I can\u2019t even begin to tell you all how your personal experiences have helped me recognize the abuse I was enduring for almost a year. I feel lucky it didn\u2019t last any longer than that. \n\n The summer before I got with my nex was the best summer of my life, I had regained confidence in myself and felt mentally strong and genuinely happy. Prior to my nex I had never been in a real relationship. When we met I was not into him whatsoever, found him to be clingy and annoying. I now see this was definite love bombing. We kind of just chatted as friends for a bit and had slept together a few times but he started talking about us as a \u2018we\u2019 even though we had never talked about a relationship, and I decided it was time to cut things off. The look on his face when I told him I wasn\u2019t interested in continuing a romantic relationship killed me. I felt so guilty for turning down a guy who seemed to be genuinely interested in me. So I decided to give him another chance and of course I fell for him. \nA few weeks later we were boyfriend and girlfriend and I was so excited to have found someone who seemed genuinely decent and different from other guys. Shortly after we got together we both moved to our respective hometowns/cities as we were working in a seasonal job when we met. The long distance was really hard, harder for him than it was for me. He would call me and talk about how lonely he was without me and how much he wanted me to move in with him. We had only been together about a month or so at this point and I made it clear we both weren\u2019t ready for that. As months wore on he continued to persist that I move to his city to be with him. As this was my first relationship I kept reiterating I was not ready. We would get into massive fights about it. I understood his frustration at the time because he was the one coming down to see me all the time. I didn\u2019t have a vehicle so wasn\u2019t able to make the trip. But he would constantly throw it in my face that he\u2019d be risking his life driving all that way to come see me. Making it sound like a chore. I would tell him if he felt unsafe driving to stay home, because His safety was my priority. Yet he\u2019d still come. There are so many other little fights and gaslighting he would throw at me to tear me down during this time but if I get into that I\u2019ll be here all night. \n\n Skip forward a few months and I find out he\u2019s been cheating on me for two months. Keep in mind we had been together for about 5 months at this point and he had spent half our relationship practically dating another girl. I tried to break it off with him and said we could be friends but I couldn\u2019t trust being in a relationship with him. He begged me to take him back, said she meant nothing to him, it was just sex, he was lonely because I wasnt there etc. made all these promises and because I was mentally so weak from the abuse I had already endured I fell for it and took him back. \nThe next 6 months of my life were like torture at times, we ended up moving in together a few months after I found out about the cheating. Thinking it would help us become a stronger couple. The red flags started popping up in my face more than ever before. He was always talking to other girls, he constantly needed female attention. Every time he\u2019d come home it was like there was a new girl on his Snapchat. And if I asked who he was talking to he would gaslight me and tell me nothing was happening and I needed to remember the promise he made me. I went through his phone a couple of times, which I know is a violation of boundaries (honestly had never even thought about doing it prior to the cheating) but even after promising me he would do anything to make up for what he did (which in reality he put little to no effort in actually doing anything of meaning) I had no reason to truly trust him. I told him I had gone through his phone to be honest and open with him and because I felt bad for doing it. He would freak out and ask me if I found anything to which I would say no. Then he would leave and go silent treatment on me for the day. When he\u2019d come back he\u2019d say he would want to take a break because he can\u2019t stand being with someone who would violate his trust like that. And of course I\u2019d beg for him to give me another chance. Everything was ALWAYS either my fault or someone else\u2019s, accountability does not exist in his vocabulary. It\u2019s like our roles reversed and I was the untrustworthy one all of a sudden. \nWe lived together for 4 months before he (discarded) ended things with me. He came home late one night, he texted me at 1 am saying he was on his way home (our apartment was a 5 minute walk from the bar) and didn\u2019t show up until 3 am. I woke up to him crashing through our bedroom door and puking his guts out. I asked him where he was the last two hours and and if he was okay and he kept saying \u201cwhy can\u2019t you just trust me\u201d at this point in time I had actually started to regain some trust with him, so I wasn\u2019t even asking because of that, I was more concerned for his safety and well being. But he planted a seed of doubt in my mind when he said that. I decided To do it and went through his phone and found a couple incriminating sexual messages on Snapchat to this girl he\u2019d been friends with, when I confronted him about it he said it was a \u2018joke\u2019 and he would never have sex with her because she has a baby and that\u2019s gross. Also found out he had been messaging the girl he cheated on me with after promising she meant nothing to him. Trying to call her too. I was furious. When I confronted him about both he said that he was really good friends with the girl and missed their friendship because she was there when I wasn\u2019t. He gaslighted me so hard he had me on the floor begging for forgiveness. He said it was the final straw and he could no longer trust me and he broke things off. \n\n We lived together for a few days after that before he got fired and had to move out (thats a whole other fucked up story). We ended up still going on a trip we had planned for months prior a few weeks later. He manipulated me and made me feel like shit the whole trip. We had seen each other a few times since the trip for sexual encounters which I know is a mistake. We had still been talking as \u2018friends\u2019 for a bit too.  He is a master at hoovering btw. Knows how to keep me pulled in. But today he started gaslighting me again and using situations against me and I finally had enough. I told him I no longer thought it was a good idea to be friends and deleted him on everything! This was something that should have happened a long time ago but I\u2019m glad I found the courage to delete him from my life, because he doesn\u2019t deserve to be in it. I know I\u2019m worth more than how he treated me and I hope all of you will come to know that too.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The whole trip is ruined by his threats and temper. Threatens to leave me and kiddo in that state while he drove back home. Abandons me and kiddo in a forest with no cell reception. All because his phone died. \n\nWe reach our destination and set up our tent, which we had borrowed from my sibling. It was cheaper to get a camping spot that to reserve a cabin and the hotel in that little town was all out of rooms, so we made the best of it. Narc was very tired from the continuous driving, and decided to go get some sleep once we set up the sleeping bags. Kiddo and I went off to my grandmas house, where most of the family was waiting. We talked about what kind of day we were going to have tomorrow, as the family has rented out the community center to have a place for all of us to get together and eat, drink, and catch up. \n\nThe next day comes, and it\u2019s so much fun to be able to learn about our family tree, see cousins who have flown here from across the world. Narc is doing his best facade, and the family adores him instantly. We get a call from the campsite manager, informing us that some strong winds have reached the town, and some tents are coming up from their spots. We rush over to make sure our tent was in place, luckily it was all good! Narc decides that he is going to take a nap, so I take the car keys and go back to the reunion. During that time, the winds brought a good amount of rain. \n\nAfter all the aunts and uncles have gone back to their rooms, the cousins decided to hit up the small town bars, but we need to pregame first! I text Narc that we are in my brothers camper, and that kiddo is crashing with my mom for the night in her RV. There was no response, so I assume that Narc is still sleeping. My cousin makes a joke about carrying Narc to the stream close to the campsite, to get him to wake up and join the fun. A few minutes later, Narc enters my brothers camper, saying he needs the keys to the car so that he can charge his phone and sleep in the car, as his sleeping bag was too wet to sleep on, and our tent was flooded from the rain... I give him the keys, and just as he\u2019s about to leave, my cousin says \u201chey, Narc, man up and come out drinking with us. You\u2019ve slept all day\u201d. Narc storms out. The rest of us go out drinking until about 2 am. \n\nThe next morning, it is time to pack up the tent. Narc slept all night in the car. As we are packing up, I noticed Narc wasn\u2019t doing much to help. I tell him I can\u2019t take down the tent AND pack up by myself, he needs to do something if he wants to get on the road in time. All he has to say is \u201cOne more remark from you or your cousin about me wanting to sleep, and I\u2019ll leave you here and drive back home myself. Also, you are NEVER taking the car keys again.\u201d \n \nThat night, we stop in at my aunts house. She lives in the same state, but about 6 hours from where we had our reunion. We plan to head home the next day, but after we go see the hiking trail and waterfall I had been looking forward to all year. Narc is still pissed, but takes me to the trail. It\u2019s beautiful, but there\u2019s absolutely no service out here, so we need to stick together and not get lost. Kiddo wants to stop and look at the river, gather some rocks and throw them into the water. I let him have some fun, and when I look up, Narc has continued his pace and is almost out of my sight. I yell for him to wait up, but that just makes him go faster. Kiddo and I decided to keep going, but stop every now and then to let kiddo play with rocks and the water. \n\nWe get to a part off the trail that splits off in 3 different directions, clearly marked with a different waterfall at the end of each trail. I have no idea which path Narc might have taken, and after his threat the day before, I wasn\u2019t about to take any chances. Kiddo and I head back toward the car. Narc had the keys, of course, as I was no longer trustworthy if holding on to the car keys after I made him have to go searching for me to charge his phone.... So kiddo and I reached the car, luckily it was still there. Narc is nowhere to be seen. After about 45 minutes, it\u2019s dark and cold out, Narc comes storming out of the trail head. all the Narc had to say at this point was \u201cnot my problem you didn\u2019t keep up\u201d. Kiddo starts to cry. He said he was scared that daddy was going to leave us alone in the forest. Narc yells at him to shut up, and that he better not hear another word from either of us the next 10 hours on the drive home. \n\nLater that week, Narc has no remorse for making my family reunion trip a living hell. He said that I should have stood up for him when my cousin made that joke. Narc said that he went up the trail that said \u201cwaterfall\u201d, and that he waited for kiddo and I to meet him up there for 20 minutes before he decided to go back to the car. I told him he went on the wrong trail, and that I had mentioned many times the exact name of the trail that I wanted to go on. He said I should have kept up, then I would have been able to go on the trail I had looked forward to that whole year. \n\nThe list of things that made him rage?\nBorrowing a tent that \u201cflooded\u201d. He said I should have spent more money on the cabin for his comfort. \nMe keeping the car keys in my pocket, rather than leaving them in the tent while he slept after I came back from the reunion. He said he looked \u201call over\u201d for me, (the campground was TINY. Flat ground with no trees and only about 15 people camping there.) and his phone was dead, so he never got my text about being in my brothers camper (which was parked about 50 feet from our tent). \nThe remark my cousin made. \nMe allowing kiddo to play on the hike. I should have told kiddo that there was to be absolutely no fun on this hike, we are only walking, and straight to the waterfall. \nSo anything that made him mad was all my fault. His threat to leave me behind was only because I made him mad. His screaming at me the whole ride home was something I deserved because I told him that he made this trip awful for me and kiddo. \n\nHe posted selfies he took at that waterfall, with captions like \u201cit\u2019s so beautiful here\u201d and \u201cseeing all that nature has to offer while in this great state\u201d. \n\nAnd for months he wondered why I refused to do anything with him ever again.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

What if you were determined to believe it was purple? You couldn't just *tell* everyone it was purple, you'd sound crazy. So instead, you make everyone *else* feel crazy for believing it's *not* purple while making sure you seem to be the most rational and level-headed and honest guy in town. \n\n\n\nHow do you do that? First, convince everyone how smart and honest you are. Spend your initial time there talking about scientific facts to anyone who will listen, and helping little old ladies cross the road. Talk about how much you love rocket science while fixing your neighbor's dishwasher for free. Etcetera etcetera.\n\n\n\nThen, get them to *validate* how smart and honest you are (and make them feel uncomfortable or punish them if they don't validate this). Ask them if they think you are a nice guy, because someone from your past is making you feel rough. Ask them constantly if you're a good neighbor, under the guise of just making sure you aren't doing anything to annoy them. Say something silly and then ask if they think you are stupid for thinking that. \n\n\n\nNext, do something like painting your house, changing it from green to orange. When townspeople ask or comment, act like it's *always* been orange and you have no idea what they are talking about, you just added a fresh coat of paint. Change the color of road signs without anyone knowing. And start making constant \"passive\" comments about how your fellow citizens are unobservant and slow, but you love them and are patient with them and it doesn't bother *you* at all.\n\n\n\nFinally, begin to introduce the concept of the sky being purple. Make offhanded comments about it. Either their wheels will start turning but they will simply accept it because you said it, they will doubt what they heard until next time you say it, or they will express disagreement. If they disagree, get defensive, as if you are shocked and offended they *don't* know this! Remind them of how smart and honest you are and all the times they themselves told you that. Remind them that they were wrong about other smaller things (that you've intentionally created doubt around), like the color of your house or road signs, and point out they've always been unobservant. If they were wrong about these basic things, they are obviously wrong about this. And tell them they are flat-out crazy for not believing you you have no reason to lie about this. Make sure to maximize their discomfort and confusion during this, so they avoid disagreeing again.\n\n\n\nNow you have gaslit a town into believing the sky is purple.

I hated being born female; I resented it. My dad had a large pornography collection on his computer and for my young self who'd experienced sex at an age when they shouldn't have, I formed the idea in my mind that women were worth nothing more than creatures to be lusted after.

I dressed as a boy, cut my hair etc. My mum was willing to allow me to do this but my dad was not. He was disturbed. Nobody knew at the time of the sexual abuse and today only my mum knows. The memory that is hurting me occurred when I was 10/11. My dad, still worried about my male presentation, forcibly shaved my legs. He sat me in the bath, covered my legs in hair removal cream, and I watched as the hair came off my legs. I had no choice in the matter. I cried and cried. I felt that I had been feminised. I was hurt. \n\nI don't know why this memory is causing me as much distress as it is. I'm 21 now.

But a lot of you will probably understand that there is much more to this.\n\nSo, this is the scenario that happened yesterday/today:\nI went shopping with my mother, and saw a lot of things I thought BF would like. Bought him relatively expensive chocolates, some new indoor pants (he is a bigger guy, so he chafes through these pants within a month or 2 to 3, hence me buying him new ones), some nice drinks, and I even brought him a HUGE piece of cake my mother made. I bought myself a cheap roll of cookies, some chips and some drinks. He seemed grateful, and I asked him, pleaded with him, to leave me the cookies. I'd accept it if he ate the chips, but the cookies were for work.\n\nYou guessed it. I get out of bed this morning, and he ate most of my cookies, all of his stuff, and left me a small handful of chips. I was pissed. Not because \"oh no, someone ate my cookies\", but this is what he always does. I'll give some examples of his behaviour when it comes to food.\n\n- He bought me a pint of B&amp;J and bought himself a gallon (A GALLON, I WISH I WAS KIDDING) of strawberry-chocolate-vanilla. I'm not a huge ice cream eater, so about two thirds end up back in the freezer. He proceeds to down ALL of his ice cream, and the next day, when I went to look for my pint, he ate that too. Not even the day after, he gulped up his own and then immediately went to get mine. HOW?\n\n- I would buy him food all the time. He always was a \"I'll only buy food for this day and buy more tomorrow\" kind of guy, and would never count me into the mix. So if I didn't spend all the little money I had (I could only work saturdays due to my busy school schedule), I would go without food. So I did buy food, only to regularly wake up to no food in the house. He'd have eaten all of it during the night, not even leaving me as much as 1 slice of bread. I'd go to school or my pretty heavy internship with NO FOOD. I would come home late at night to no food again if I didn't cook or shop, so I would start dinner after going without food for more than 24 hours. I know there are people out there who do worse, but this was just plain unnecessary. I only went without food because he wouldn't care if I ate. He said he did, but hey, there would've been food then. Just leave me a freaking cracker then!!!\n\n-He would tell me to buy stuff he doesn't like. But unless it really grosses him out, he'll still eat it. He'll tell me he doesn't like something, proceed to eat ALL OF IT, and tell me he ate it because there was nothing nice to eat and he was bored.\n\nNothing I've done helps. Hiding food is all that helps, sometimes. But if he does find it, it's gone twice as fast. I try buying him even MORE, but he'll just end up eating my stuff first. His reasoning is as follows:\n- If you don't want me to eat it, don't buy it (so either you starve because I ate everything, or you starve because you didn't want me to eat everything)\n- I can't help it that I can't control myself, you should show some more understanding and not make a big deal out of it.\n- Sorry you don't have any food left (not sorry I ate it, but sorry you're hurt by it)\n- Just go buy new ones (that he'll eat too)\n- You can't expect me to not eat it if it is in the house\n- You're at fault for me being fat, if you didn't bring it into the house, I couldn't eat it (since he's too lazy to go to the store, HIS words, not mine)\n\nThere's more where that came from, but those are the ones I can think of now. I know it all sounds petty at first, but with all of our history and his lack of respect for me and a LOT more, it just hurts way more than it should. Seeing the more than half eaten pack of cookies just made me hate him for a split second. I can't have anything, because he will always reserve the right to take EVERYTHING from me. And if I don't want him to take it from me, I shouldn't own it. This isn't even the first time this week. He'll say sorry now, but not because he means it, but because to him, it's the magic word to make me shut up. \"I said I was sorry, so really, you're the problem here\". Or he will end up getting me something new, while buying himself 2 to 3 times as much as he got me, only to eat half of mine as well, since I \"now had what I should have had if he hadn't eaten it\". \n\nI'm not at work, not able to concentrate and on the verge of crying over some COOKIES. THIS is exactly what they do to us. They break us down over a period of time, until YOU look like the problem, crying over little things. All the while, they refuse to look at it for what it is, namely a sign of disrespect. I sent him a message telling him how I feel, but that will just result in him getting mad at me for ruining his day. Fine by me, he ruined mine. If he can be petty, so can I. I'm absolutely fine with getting the silence treatment today at this point.\n\nDo any of you know what I can do? Because I am at a loss. Any tips are welcome. I just really had to vent, had to get this off my chest, because I was absolutely going crazy because of my internal dialogue... Thank you guys!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Need to vent \n\nTLDR; I feel like I\u2019m never going to feel better again. Even taking it day by day. I\u2019m taking all the right measures but each day is a battle. I am afraid I\u2019ll never get over this and that I will never heal from this. Someone hurt me so bad and I wish that I\u2019d been the one to leave when I had the chance instead of being so screwed over by another person. I feel like I\u2019m still in love with him but that can\u2019t be the case, right? Who could love someone who has done so many terrible things to me. \n\nDiscard was a little over two months ago. Packed his things when I was away, had his entire family in on it and they made me this terrible person. Left me to deal with the house and figuring out all the financial stuff and measures to take to \u201cget him off of it\u201d cause he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want it anymore. \u201c which that\u2019s hurtful in itself, we bought this place together to have something of our own and in one moment you leave because you simply are done. What kind of child buys a property and then runs away and complains that they don\u2019t want it anymore. Like a little toddler who is bored of their toy and tosses it aside. It\u2019s a fucking house. Not a toy. \n\nHe spent the last couple years keeping me in a trance. Verbally and physically abusing me. Cheating on me. Making me feel like I couldn\u2019t do anything without him. And in the end he leaves me without even having a conversation to my face and then cutting off communication. I didn\u2019t get a goodbye. I didn\u2019t get any respect. He told me he and his career were more important than me and bolted. \n\nI was a fucking wreck the weeks after this happened. Let alone, four months ago he hurt me so bad the cops were called and he was arrested. I\u2019ve spent a third of my year healing from two separate traumatic events. \n\nBut now I\u2019m still sitting here feeling so depressed every day. I\u2019m still waiting to finalize the house in my name. He also left me with our (my) dog, which is so sad because what kind of person just straight up abandons the little family and house they made??? Just like that. Even after I let him come back after the night he assaulted me. \n\nNo responsibility or accountability. I never got an apology. All I ever got were emails of him saying how much fun he was having now. And that he actually wanted to leave me way before the night he hurt me. He hounds me as to why the house isn\u2019t \u201cdone\u201d yet which I have explained time and time again that it takes weeks and weeks with a mortgage company to do this. He wants to rid of me and wants out so bad. It is so cruel and my head still every single day is like how could you? How could you put me in so much distress? Mentally and physically and emotionally and financially. He told me I was his soulmate and as soon as I helped him get a plea deal in court because he said he\u2019d be a \u201cbetter person\u201d to me, he left!!! I saved his job, I saved his reputation. He hurt me and my family and my friends. He doesn\u2019t care at all about any of that. \n\nI am in therapy every week. And at first I thought it was helping. Now I\u2019m just feeling like every week I talk about how I can\u2019t believe this still. How much it hurts that someone who was SO in love with me at times, obsessive with me at times, completely over the top love bombing after his ridiculous fights with me. The whole nine yards, typical. And because I haven\u2019t signed papers for the house yet I feel like I\u2019m in limbo. I go to work and bust my ass there. Try to take care of myself. But I sit in this house that feels like a skeleton of something that once was and it hurts so bad that someone could put me through this. \n\nI should have left when I found the messages from a year ago to his ex. He had been cheating on me and I didn\u2019t know it. He told this chick he wanted to marry her and buy a house and get a dog and have kids with her and they were soulmates. Sound familiar? That\u2019s not fucking normal. You don\u2019t claim every person you meet to be the one. What the fuck. \n\n\nI can\u2019t make sense of it. My heart is so broken still and I am so terrified that I\u2019m never going to move on and stop hurting from this. I am so afraid that I am never going to feel okay again. I know he\u2019s moved on, he always did very fast in between when we were together. I know that says more about him than me. But I feel like an idiot that I never left when he would physically hurt me. When he would call me names. So many names so many times. When he made fun of my friends or family. When he told me it would be better if I was dead. All those awful memories that I\u2019ve pushed aside because I was so in love. I know he\u2019s a fraud. After he discarded me all he could say is that WE were toxic and that I brought out the worst in him. It all comes back to me. Not him. Tells me he isn\u2019t a bad guy, he\u2019s just done some bad things. \n\nI feel so alone in all of this. I\u2019m trying to feel better but I don\u2019t know how. I take it day by day. But when will the days not feel like such a battle. \n\nI don\u2019t feel pretty anymore. I don\u2019t feel like I have my shit together anymore. Even with a promotion at work and even though I\u2019ve gone on a couple casual dates. Even though I have a home and a job and an education and I\u2019m doing all the right things for myself.

I was dating a covert narcissist for three months before she broke our relationship. She claimed her feelings had not burgeoned enough to warrant a continuation of \u2018us\u2019. Whereas, her relationship with her ex-boyfriend never allowed her feelings to uplift into the ether, yet she stayed with him for twelve months(she sent me this over text)? Why did she afford him four times the amount of time that she afforded me and yet never did her feelings reach \u2018love\u2019 status(it must have been the resources he offered her). I must say, her ex-boyfriend was a doormat and a scion, a descendent from an aristocratic family. Whereas, I simply possessed good looks and an intellectual mind. I also refused to be degraded and denigrated for my supposed \u2018immature\u2019 acts of behaviour(this retaliation made her irate, passive-aggressive behaviour began straight away). I am very mature, this NPD would call me out to feel in control and dominant. She liked viewing me as a subordinate.\n\nIt is funny, when I called her out for dating her ex-boyfriend for twelve months she never responded. I had spotted an irregularity and she had no room to refute. \n\nOne last thing, I have known this covert NPD for years. We were once close friends, in hindsight I am disgusted that I allowed her so close to my private side. Anyhow, she had always been incredibly rude and undeniably condescending when intimacy started to become something possible. First year I rejected her signs and she started to discipline me as a parent would. This time round we were in a relationship and she decided to perform the same operation. It is a warning sign. On every occasion she severed contact with me a few days after. \n\nWhy does this specifically happen to me(do I possess a trait that is inimical and harmful?) Why not other people? I know people she has treated in a similar way and yet they managed to keep in constant contact with her. She did tell me that she felt threatened by my intelligence. I think she knew of what I knew before the break up, she ran to make herself feel better.

Fearless in doing so.) because you can't do shit when their eyes, ears, mind and heart are closed. They need to be open for that to even be an option. They never will change if you are there. Sad truth. It is a form of enabling. Giving all your unconditional love to these people will only kill your light slowly. Love yourself instead.\n\n(I have discovered now that it isn't actually unlucky to meet these Narcissists, it is our hardcore training. To make us so much stronger and wiser. To build character. I used to not have boundaries, but after this I am a motherfucking powerhouse!\ud83d\ude0e)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BaSoUhNms4I &lt;-- \"You thought the whole world was spin,\nSpin, spinnin' around you.\nYou held me down, down,\ndown bettin' I'll never break through.

That he is going to be on the wrong side of history and it will be very interesting going forward as the narcs are going to lose their fake masks and all their power. He called me retarded and said climate change isn't real and that he wants to keep just partying and having fun in life. These egotistic and ignorant narcissists will soon get the Karma they deserve haha. Enjoy being on the wrong side you giant fucking asshole. P.S, I'm sure having a lot more fun than you!\ud83d\ude02 Weeeeee \ud83d\udd4a)\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/faroutofficial/far-out-on-my-own-feat-karra &lt;-- Strong on my own.\n\nUse all the bad memories to remind yourself of reality as you stay as far away as you can. They can be quite tricky with their gifts and words. The promises of loving change never stick however do they. Guilt trips, pity parties, manipulation, gaslighting. Lies upon lies. Pretty lies but nonetheless deadly.\n\nI too have been someone unfortunate in my life. They are constantly drawn to me. So now I have written down some things for myself to regain self love and keeping them from ever being able to affect me negatively again.\ud83c\udf38\n\nI think this is some of the keys to taking back your life:\n\nDetaching yourself from them. Stepping up to them, standing up for yourself. Then letting go.\n\nDon't let them feed off of your energy. Don't let them tell you that you are trash. Don't let them crush your dreams. Don't let them tell you to shut up while they also expect you to listen to them.\n\nDon't take any opinions from anyone that won't listen to yours.\n\nThese people are ALWAYS wrong. If they never even consider your opinion.\n\nThey always think they are right somehow, they always are very entitled. But they are never right. As referred to above.\n\nThese people won't even consider if you are right, they will immediately feel attacked by your spot on words and punch you in the cunt and dick. The crown jewels, the ones they try to steal. To treat like their own when it never was.\n\nWhere it really hurts. They try their best to be hurtful yes, because they can't face their own mirror reflection. \n\nDon't give your undivided attention, support and love to those that wont do the same for you.\n\nLove yourself. Respect yourself. Never give up on yourself. Let go of the negative energy vampires. You will shine this way. Your light will return.\n\nForgive those that see their wrong doing, forgive those that ask for forgiveness truely and WILL change their ways. Not those that pretend they will. \n\nForgiveness is earned. Not freely given to those that lie and make empty promises that they break the next chance they get. These will take advantage of you. They will stomp on you again if you let them.\n\nDon't let them beat on you. You are not a punching bag.\n\nThese people are cowards. They are truely empty inside. They need to beat on you to feel better. Don't let them. Leave.\n\nYou are your own star, moon, sun and galaxy. Be your own hero. Be your own main character in your story.\n\nLet the narcissists fall away to mere mad man rantings in the background. They are not even background characters anymore. Simply NPCs with toxic things to spit.\n\nThese narcissists are without honor. They are not to be honored with listening to. Be honorable back however. You are with honor. Be honest and real unlike them. Your authentic true light from within.\n\nYou are not going to let their toxic cloud poison you anymore. Step away. Enjoy your own chorus of the music that is life.\n\nEnjoy YOUR dream, it isn't anyone elses.\u2764\ufe0f\n\nFind the comedy in it. \ud83e\udd21 How hilarious it is to see their temper tantrums as you rise above it all. This helps A LOT. Be the honorable one. The one that steps back and doesn't engage in the fight.\n\nRising above whatever horrible battle they try to start with you. Be the better man/woman that is with compassionate action, honesty, bravery and true love.\n\nBe the one that puts their money where their mouth is. Not like those narcissists that talk a lot of smack, without any actual action. Talk is cheap isn't it. They are cheap. Cheap copies.\n\nThese narcissists will feel very priviliged and above you. They will be dressing in expensive pearls and trickery to seem to be of class. They are the opposite of classy. Class can't be bought.\n\nTrue class is simply how you act towards others. How you treat your waitress and anyone else these narcissists deem they can be bossing around. You are not above anyone. You are their friend. (Yes I know some of them act extra fake nice to the waitress and others to have a good reputation while you are the only one they treat like trash. They are not identical in their ways.)\n\nAlways expect someone knows something that you don't. Truely listen. Truely consider others. Be considerate. Always.\n\nYou are original, you have a golden heart. Stay firm. Kind Braveheart. \n\nThis has made you stronger and now you know how to love yourself and others properly. Cheers. A toast to us. Thank you.\ud83e\udde1\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk. \ud83d\ude18\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/psykopunkz/victorious &lt;-- We will be victorious.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I felt bad for his puppy (I ADORED this dog) so I let him stay ON THE FLOOR of my living room. No kissing, no nothing. At some point we decided to go for a hike, and I had an anxiety attack. I divorced him mostly due to his drug use, and when I had my anxiety attack he offered me a bit of what he had (something legal, found in smoke shops) and it instantly made me happy and cheer up.\n\nThat led to a two year addiction and several attempts to detox. We've been texting for almost a year, a comfortable exchange of chatter and our day but nothing about a relationship.\n\nI finally got help about a month ago, and he decided to do the same thing, even though when I first started looking for detox he said I should never use the method I'm on to get off that stuff. It's a narcotic itself, used to wean addicts off pretty much anything. So a week within starting my program he decided he wanted to quit his very-long habit that broke us apart. He had to make it about HIM. Everything became about how much he had and for how much, criticizing me for the way my program works.\n\nFlash forward to last week, I'm doing really well, and he had another appointment and received 2x as much of a prescription I have, and now barely texting me. He wanted total control over my use of that stuff and my treatment, and then he had to just prove he can do it better than me.\n\nI finally said \"so you're ghosting me, huh?\" and he said \"YOU KNOW THAT LASHING OUT SHIT WONT WORK\". \n\nNo, bro, I'm not lashing out, I don't have feelings for you, I just know exactly what you're doing. Same story, different day. Trying to make me mad by telling me I'm angry when he has only seen me once (last weekend) in almost 3 years. And probably not even doing anything legal and lying to me. \n\nThis is basically a rant but they never change. NEVER.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u2019m trying to decide if I should leave my boyfriend of 11 years. I love him very much, but I always seem to be in this spot of wondering if I should leave.\n\nFirst, he drinks a lot. 4-6 drinks 7 days a week. More drinks on the weekends.\n\nSecond, our communication sucks. Probably secondary to his alcohol abuse. I try to talk about problems but he always thinks I\u2019m arguing or nagging him. Or that I\u2019m never happy. I continually bring them up because they never feel resolved to me. He always dismisses them. And somehow I end up apologizing at the end of the convo if we have one.\n\nThird, I never feel like I can\u2019t make a decision without running it by him first. If my friends want to hang out, I always make it for a day/time he\u2019s busy because I know he won\u2019t like me going out if he is home. But yet he leaves me to go to the bar multiple days a week. \n\nI also feel he gaslights me, not on purpose but it happens. And not the extreme that I hear about, but it still exists. I\u2019m \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d, and \u201ccan\u2019t take a joke\u201d. He rolls his eyes a lot, scoffs, and uses an angry tone. Sometimes I feel like he talks to me like I\u2019m dumb. I caught him having an emotional relationship for a year with a mutual friend and he flat out denied it despite the proof in the texts.  He claim he \u201cchose his words wrong\u201d and that there was nothing behind them. I mean one of them said \u201cmy heart sank in my chest when you send me your picture\u201d. And \u201cyou\u2019re amazing\u201d. Idk how that can be choosing words wrong. \n\nHowever, I do have anxiety and tend to blow things out of proportion. He says he doesn\u2019t feel loved by me &amp; it\u2019s related to my anxiety regarding touch (sensory problems). He can\u2019t lay on me or rub my arms/legs/butt because it sends my nervous system into overdrive. I have no problem laying on him or cuddling into him though. But I guess it\u2019s not good enough.

She  called and lied to police that same day after making me have a breakdown in which i left to go for a short bike ride. She lied to the doctors that day when i had to go to the er for an evaluation. She called the cops on me a few days after that when she made me apologise for having a breakdown, but thought the apology wasn't good enough, and that she wouldn't take me to school that day (During finals week).   \nThat was only in may  \n\n\nWhen my dad left to take care of family matters over seas, it got worse. June was whem he went and she began trying to frame me for false child abuse, cause i \"wasn't\" emotionally attached to my little sister enough. She banged a hammer against my door to wake me up at 5am threatening to assault me with a hammer and tare down my door if i didn't go wash dishes that weren't my responsibility and i had no part in since i had to walk 5+ miles around my town trying to apply for jobs. She called the cops latter that day on me when i came home and found my door was gone; But she implied my older sibling to lie along with her to the police, and so even they didn't believe me and blamed me.   \nShe would try to humiliate me, tear down my self esteem an incredible amount that month. She physically tried throwing me out of the house multiple times.  \nShe would call cps on me to try and get me into juvenile detention (aka jail for minors) or worse. she stole my keys, she threw water on me when she was upset, she intentionally put my little sister in situations where she could frame me for child abuse.   \nAll in all i think she called the cops on me 4-5 times that month, and cps 3-4 times  \n\n\nThen comes July. My neighbour who i was very close to dies of a sudden heart attack, and i see paramedics take him into the ambulance.... which at that point i didn't know he was already dead. July 4th or 5th She makes fun of him in an awful way saying how she's sure i'd love to eat his dead flesh.   \nThis was the moment i cracked and couldn't stay peaceful, instead of hurting anyone, i threw a candle at the wall as hard as i could, and left to go cry in my room, the cops and cps were called on me again. This was the same day she cursed and disowned me. Making it now 2 people in my family who have disowned me, and 2 who've cursed me.  \nThings like this happen maybe 3 more times that month before my dad came back and she somewhat stopped.   \nBut my dad didn't believe she did all these bad things, Even when a few days after he came back, he heard her clearly repeatedly call me retarded, he said he didn't hear anything.  \n\n\nEver since that day i haven't spoken to her. And for a while i was left with a fear of led flashlights after having to deal with police so many times.  \n\n\nIt's my senior year in highschool, and i'm 17.  And while nothing bad has happened since late July, i still don't know what i'm doing with my life.   \nMost Collage deadlines are in December, I haven't been able to take my sat or act, the only form of official id i have is my passport, and my GPa after this semester will be at best probably a 2.8-2.9.   \nAnd i know i won't get kicked out before my birthday this coming August.  \nEven though i'm somewhat on medication, and have a therapist, It's hard coping.  \nI just don't know what to do.  \nThe days are flying past me, and i don't even have a job, or savings. Nowhere within distance is hiring me. And i don't have much time left.   \nI try putting on a brave face, but i feel lost. So much of my motivation was killed, so many of my life aspirations too.  \n\n\nHell, since i began meeting my therapist in august, he kept saying how the past is in the past, even when it was only days ago at that time that things began to be less hectic.  \nJust feel so clueless", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

And you know what it means. But it isn\u2019t having the effect you want it to. I\u2019m not learning any lesson, nor am I being punished for some perceived slight. You\u2019re only showcasing yourself as an abusive manipulator. No one outside of abusive manipulators behaves likes this. I\u2019m asking you to stop. \n\nMe - I\u2019m not punishing or manipulating. I\u2019m setting boundaries and maintaining them for my own sanity and self-worth. \n\nHim - What you\u2019re doing is painting yourself the victim, but you\u2019re not the victim. It\u2019s a very common manipulative tactic utilized by abusers to paint their chosen target as the abuser.  By attempting to elicit a reaction by constantly pushing their buttons until they have some sort of emotional outburst, usually very public. \n\nI\u2019m not longer your supply, and have established boundaries of my own.

I won\u2019t continue to allow you to put me in the dark.\n\nHim - What you\u2019re doing is an attempt at targeted abuse, not setting boundaries. Establishing a boundary requires telling the other person what the boundary is, how they crossed it, and how you\u2019d like to move forward. But, that isn\u2019t what is happening here. What\u2019s happening here is a product of a perceived injury, being painted as something else and intentionally advertised in an effort to give the image of self protection. \n\nHim - You will not provoke the response you\u2019re looking for from me. \n\nHim - If you want things to change, let\u2019s discuss them. I don\u2019t mind making concessions if you need to establish a boundary. But relationships are give and take. This one has been messed up from the start, so it will take hard work from both of us to make it work. I\u2019m willing to do that work, but I\u2019m. Or willing to be take continued abuse or allow you to use me anymore. \n\nHim - Would you consider re-entering couples counseling to help us deal with the issues in our relationship?\n\nHim - If not, I don\u2019t see much choice other than to peruse other forms of intervention to put a stop to this abuse being used as a means to attempt to assert control over me \n\nHim - Overall, what I\u2019m trying to say is that I\u2019ll make a very serious attempt to correct things in our relationship if you will do the same. \n\nHim - No reply?  \n\nMe - No\n\nHim - Do you realize what you\u2019re saying by not saying anything?\n\nHim - Hey. Quit it already. I want us to try to get better, and I think you do too. I think we just have different ideas of what better is. \n\nHim - Work with me?

But here's a happy story for you:\n\nI was discarded, and I thought I'd not be contacted anymore since he seemed to have some kind of endless supply of people to screw around with. The previous week though, whilst texting someone else I saw the \"typing...\" thing go on the chat I used to have with him.\n\nNot gonna lie, that gave me a massive panic attack. And of all things I was away from where I usually am, alone, with no one to turn to, with family members who were with me having depart just an hour earlier for another country. The timing couldn't have been worse.\n\nPhone pings a little while later. \"Fuck me\", I thought. I could preview messages on my phone, and it was something about him wanting to \"reconnect\", acknowledging that I treated him well, and wanting to catch up.\n\nHe knew I'd have to reply it else it'll give him ammunition to make me look like a massive ass. I had read receipts on with people, so I decided to act unfazed and read the message as usual, else it'll look like I'm intentionally avoiding him.\n\nI didn't reply it until the day after though. I was really worried about what he truly wanted from me, and I needed to think about what I wanted to say. I wanted to be back somewhere safe, and not at the unfamiliar place I was in the day I received the text. Plus, the panic he gave me made me dissociate for quite a significant amount of time.\n\nMy initial strategy wasn't perfect. I acted somewhat colder and defensive, after deflecting the bit about wanting to catch up in person, and telling him I was busy hence the delayed reply. I mean, I didn't know his true motives. He pleaded me to be warmer, and I thought he was really being genuine this time round. So I turned into my usual warm self, but only after setting a Boundary (tm) that I tactically wanted.\n\nAnd so it progressed and we had this really long chat, where I asked him about his life whilst not offering much of mine. Accidentally went on the offensive and asked about the new supply (which he used previously to triangulate me), and silly him oversupplied way more info than I asked for. I casually noted that he treated new supply better than he ever did to me, and he took it as me being competitive (which is a Thing He Always Accuses Me Of). Told him to chill out, and informed him I didn't give one iota of fucks about who he treats better than me anymore (it used to be A Thing That Triggered Me). Chat progressed around new supply and ended up with me being a cheerleader of him and new supply. I was honestly genuinely happy for him having someone he said he really connected to, and told him to take his chances and not rest on his laurels.\n\nHe thanked me coolly. I told him I still cared about him (as I do with all the people I know) and hoped he eventually be happy, and with the new supply. I then addressed the very first message he sent (which if you remember, I deflected), and told him to tell me if and when he wanted to catch up in person! Got radio silence since, and he hasn't been online on that messaging app since reading my reply.\n\nAnd this is really significant, because 1) it's an app I have figured out he exclusively uses with potential supplies (and predominantly me - since most of the potentials don't get hooked and don't enter the cycle), and he'd used to do this weird thing where he'll just keep going on and off online and refused to text me first even though I sensed he wanted to, and I'd have to take the initiative. Or 2) he'd just be online to make me jealous since it meant he was talking to other potential/supplies, if he wasn't texting me.\n\nSo wanting to catch up was indeed kind of a ruse on his part to get me back in. But more importantly though, him not following up on it after the chat (that went really well for me) meant that he couldn't take the fact that I could be genuinely happy of him and someone he triangulated me with; or that I was well, bubbly, happy and not finally chasing that conditional acceptance nonsense after being \"discarded\" by him. I was truly just living my own life as well as I could.\n\nLet's hope this attempted hoover is the last, and the end of it all!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Most of them involved Valentine's day texting (again google it to find out more)\n\nAnyway my phone did this. At 3am the first night. I woke up thinking oh heck my NEX hacked my phone. I know he had a back door in it since he set it up and is an IT security expert. So I went and bought a new phone before reading the news.\n\nI get new phone setup, but not connected to wifi yet as Im redoing all my electronics due to my NEX, so it was only connected to the carrier's data network. \n\nHappened again and unfortunately to my NEX. \n\nI don't check up on him at all, I want nothing to do with him or know anything about his life. But considering he tried to kill me and has shown up to my house multiple times blacked out, I have to make sure until I can move (pending completion of medical procedures) I see if he texts or reaches out, its the only warning I get sometimes.\n\nSo yeah.... he got confused and didn't understand why I was sending these messages and was getting upset.\n\nI was 13 days NC with him, THIRTEEN DAYS!!! Which in the 1.5 years since I left him shy of the time there was a restraining order in place, the longest I have ever gone. He has always pulled me back in with fear or some other manipulation but I wised up and started reading books, built a support network, have someone staying at my house with me these days, etc. So it was time to finally make that move.\n\nHe's been pretty upset but not saying anything I can take to a judge for a new restraining order. But the longer it goes and he realizes I am serious about this the worse it will get for a bit, its just how he is and how he has managed to break me from going NC before.\n\nUnfortunately this text message thing undid that and I had to send him a link to the news articles and nothing else.\n\nI'm hoping that is the end of it and don't plan to ever respond again. New electronics being set up, move plan in place, just another 5 months of healing before I can get a new house, phone number, and life in a different city and state.\n\nBut this really messed things up for me in my head, I was doing so good, so proud of myself.

He was everything I wanted in a man,attentive, caring, and so much more, I had finally met my soul mate I thought. Before we married he went out of his way to make me feel special, bringing me food in between classes, making sure I had gas in the car. I started making excuses not long after we began dating, he slept with someone else because he wanted to be sure he was ready for a relationship,he was stressed about his grandmother and that's why he lost his temper. Telling myself that he didn't mean to forget my birthday, or that he was just busy and that's why I didn't always feel like a priority in his life. This is all normal relationship stuff and I was just making a big deal about nothing. \n\nI'd always had a bad memory, but after we started dating it seemed like it was worse, I was constantly being told that I hadn't told him something that I would swear I had, even remembering the conversation we were having when I told him. He would tell me that apparently I had just forgotten to tell him and only thought I had, maybe he was right, he loved me after all and it really wasn't a big deal that he forgot my birthday, or forgot some plans we had made, I was just forgetful after all, and it was my fault for not reminding him I would tell myself. \n\nHe would screw up occasionally, telling me that he messed up in quality and not quantity, so on the occasion that he did mess up it would really be bad, but he was always sorry and would be more attentive and kind until I would forgive him and go on \n\nEvery argument he would sit there and watch me pace and have my say, never interrupting, until I started to feel irrational and like it wasn't really as big a deal as I was making it out to be. I would stop and beg him to say something, only to be met with \"what do you want me to say?\" . The argument would end with nothing resolved and my still not feeling heard \n\n6 years after we started dating the man of my dreams asked me to be his wife, I happily agreed, thinking that he had finally asked me because he had decided to grow up and be responsible. Having held down 2 serious jobs in the 6 years we had been together, with my working because I finally decided that I was going to have to be the breadwinner of the family. \n\nI loved him, and every time I had an issue I reminded myself that he treated me well, and everything would work out because he loved me too\n\nLess then 3 months after we got married the man of my dreams shoved me onto our bed and assaulted me. It hurt,and I wasn't strong enough to fight him off, I blamed myself and after a month of trying to cope with it, I relented and let him back in our bed, bad things happen and he didn't realize that he'd gone too far, we had a child together and I didn't want to leave him, I had made such a big deal about how well he treated me. I told no one and put it to the back of my mind and continued to try and make it work. \n\nHe'd lost his job and wouldn't look for work for almost a year. I started filling out applications for him and asking him to help keep the house clean since he was always home, nothing was ever done. \n\nSlowly over the years, I withdrew from the world and threw myself into my children and trying to make this man who slowly started to pull away and become an angry stranger happy, blaming myself for not keeping him that way. I shouldn't have complained about that ,or I really do get crabby sometimes. He would push me to take my meds and it was my fault that I didn't take care of him better. \n\nHe grew distant and cold, only showing emotion when he was complaining about something I had done, or hadn't done. Every time I would beg for days when I knew something was bothering him, eventually deciding that it was my fault that he was unhappy, and spending days trying to make it up to him \n\nAfter the first 2 years, he stopped sharing a bed with me, my suddenly passionate lover only came to me for a quick few moments of sex,never giving me affection afterwards, just leaving me alone again to consider and finally decide that he didn't find me attractive anymore, that everyone loses their beauty as they age and that was all it was. \n\nWe didn't share a bed for 4 years, he started to complain that our bed hurt his back, but every time I mentioned buying a new one, he dismissed it and just kept sleeping on the couch \n\nHe wouldn't throw things away, so I bought another trash can and moved it to the living room, but still he wouldn't clean \n\nI told him that I wasn't happy, and that something needed to change after the first 4 years of our marriage, I told him I thought he had depression and there was no shame in it, he just needed to get to the doctor and it'd get better. \n\nHe came up with the same ideas to improve our relationship that I had given him, but slowly things were getting bad again. I complained that our relationship was on a cycle and it wasn't healthy. \n\nHe dismissed me and said he was fine, that obviously I was the one with the problem since I was unhappy \n\nI gave him his ring back 3 times, I would pack a bag and try to leave and he would talk me into staying, I even got in the car and tried to drive away, only to be talked back within hours of leaving \n\nEvery time I threatened to leave, he would be sweet and attentive, kind and helpful, but only for a week or two, slowly slipping back into the same old habits \n\nI started to suspect he was lying to me soon after our wedding, but rarely catching him \n\nYear 7 I ended it, I had worked so hard to build us a home, we had 2 children together, he started being aggressive towards our oldest and I caught myself drawing his attention to myself, telling myself that I had chosen this life, my children hadn't \n\nI swore he was going to hit me 3 times during our marriage, I'd already caught him mistreating our dog,he swore it would never happen again. I tried to give the dog away, feeling terrible when no one would take her \n\nHe bullied our oldest and ignored our youngest, leaving for hours if not the whole day sometimes, preferring his friends to his family. \n\nI got to where I was worried about leaving our youngest with him, afraid that he would mistreat her, or ignore her.\n\nI met this amazing man on the internet who constantly showered me with attention, told me that I was beautiful and worshipped me, night and day from how I'd been treated \n\nMy ex found out about this other man, and started going back and forth between giving me absolute hell,and trying to shower me with attention \n\nI walked out and stayed with friends who saw things for how they were, refusing to let me go back around my ex.\n\nRight after Christmas he went to a lawyer, and using my boyfriend's old record, took my children from me, I couldn't see or talk to him or my children for almost a month, hoping they were ok,that he wasn't telling them that I didn't love them anymore, wanting to die \n\nWe went to court and he was given full custody, only being granted 4 days a month to spend with my children \n\nI was allowed to go back over to the house and collect my things, he fell to the floor and cried, begging me to come back, that my children needed me and my place was with them,after months I relented and decided to give him another chance \n\nI feel so stupid, I went back time and again, telling myself that he was a good father to our children, and we could work on our problems, he still loved me obviously \n\nI moved out of state to start a new life for us, he started accusing me of cheating, of betraying him, I came back home and spent weeks alone in our house, packing it up alone and barely getting to see my children, while he tried to convince me that he was suicidal and overdosing \n\nI've caught him in lie after lie lately. He's starting to lose control and I am to the point that I'm afraid to be alone with him \n\nIf you've read all this, thank you, I went years hiding how bad it was at home, and now I hope my story will save someone else before they get themselves into the same situation as I did \n\nIf you feel like something is wrong...... it probably is", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

He said he would rather spend it separately. He told me to stop \"acting like we're married\". I didn't realize that wanting someone to come home with you for the holidays was something only married couples do. Anyways, he told me right then and there that he was breaking up with me. He blocked number, blocked me on Facebook, and delete me on Snap, the whole nine yards. He said to pack up all my stuff, give him back his key and leave. At first he wouldn't tell me his reason and then told me it was because I was being irrational. \n\nHe said I could either apologize for being irrational or be broken up with him. I apologized and then said something that really threw me for a loop. He asked me after we \"got back together\" if I was still going to move out my things. That confused me. He said \"Well I accept your apology and I still want to date you, but that doesn't mean you still want to date me\"\n\nI can't tell if he knows he's being abusive and wants me to leave or if he doesn't want to be together at all and is waiting for me to leave.\n\nAnyways, I'm stuck in a relationship that I don't want to be in and I don't know what steps to take to get myself. All of the things I've read say \"just leave\" but it's more complicated than that.

I've heard a couple of stories of people who have done this and it works for them. I've thought about just installing Bumble again and trying to find someone new and better, even though it would take some time. I'm not a cheater. I've never cheated. But it's something he's done to me. I'm not or wouldn't do it for revenge. That's not a healthy way to to about it. It's just that I know what I want and know what I deserve, I just don't know if it would be effective to \"move on\" before *actually* moving on if that makes sense.\n\n[Previous Post I Made](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/drp9fn/i_dont_know_if_im_in_an_abusivenarcissistic/)", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I thought this was the perfect relationship at first. He was kind, courteous, and always wanted to listen to me. I willingly gave up my virginity to him, because he seemed like the perfect guy to do it, and I thought this relationship would be a long-lasting one.\n\nAt least, that was the first week.\n\nThings didn\u2019t decline until week two. He hit me for the first time. A clean slap across the face. I\u2019ll tell you what that did. It send me into a downward, self-doubt spiral. Everything I thought was real, suddenly wasn\u2019t. He coddled me, told me he was sorry, that he wouldn\u2019t do it again. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to hit you!\u201d \u201cI have ADHD and I have low impulse control!\u201d \u201cPlease, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d I believed him.\n\nWe had sex nearly every day for the first month. Sometimes I wanted it, sometimes I flat out said no. Yet... it happened anyways. Can I really consider it rape? Not by textbook definition, no. This felt more like sexual coercion; he would growl and use demeaning words to make me submit to him. This wasn\u2019t BDSM, either, which is something I\u2019m very fond of. This was abuse.\n\nWeek 4. He hits me again, this time at lunch. He didn\u2019t hit me so hard that time. But it was terribly frightening. I ran away to a hallway nearby and cried. He followed me, also crying, and held me. Same thing as before; coddling, apologizing, promises of never hitting me again. He used the same excuse with his ADHD as before, too. I believed him again.\n\nWeek five, our sex life came to a stop. He came out to me as cupioromantic. He didn\u2019t love me, but wanted a relationship with me. This almost made me leave him. But you know what? After school that day, he gave me a promise lock - we\u2019d be together forever, he said. We started having sex again after that.\n\nIt was the beginning of October when he hit me for a third time. All my friends now hated him and wanted me to leave him. I almost did. Really, I did. I was a mess. But you know what? For a third time, he did the same damn thing. I was coddled. I was held. I was apologized to. I was told this wouldn\u2019t happen again. You know what I said? \u201cI believe you.\u201d\n\nNovember 4th. I remember this day in particular for one, simple reason. He hit me, but this time people saw it. I tried to run away. You know what he did? He lunged on me. I almost fell. He was a 5\u20192, scrawny trans boy, and almost made a 5\u20196, chubby trans man fall. I threw the collar in his face and told him to leave me the fuck alone. All of my friends knew it happened again. They could see it in my eyes. You know what I did? Texted my boyfriend. I BEGGED HIM, and I said HIM, for FORGIVENESS. Not a word, not a sound from him until second period that day. I saw him in the five minute passing period we have, asked for the collar back, and gave him a kiss on the cheek. I went on my merry way.\n\nWe had sex that Thursday, November 7th. I admitted that I was traumatized by him, after all he had done, and cried in his arms. He assured me, PROMISED ME, that we were okay. We would push through like we always had. Everything would be okay.\n\nYet... it wasn\u2019t. November 8th, the next day, he asked for my best friend\u2019s number. \u201cI just need help with English,\u201d he said. No big deal! I was too sick to help him, being bedridden. I gave it to him without a shred of doubt in my mind.\n\nYesterday. I remember it. November 9th. I get a text from him, saying I deserve someone who will listen to me and not hit me. I call him. He says he feels obligated to be with me. He says he wasn\u2019t happy - despite me asking him almost every day if he was. He says he was finished. He asks for the collar back. I was sobbing, you see, for one last chance. One last go to fix the relationship. He was having none of it. He mentions my best friend, and says they helped him dump me.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll see you Monday,\u201d I said, and hung up.\n\nI texted my best friend in a state of delirium. There\u2019s 23 texts. They call me and try to explain their side, but I had none of it. I wanted nothing to do with him. I was hurt, still am. I hung up on him. I texted him a couple hours later to never talk to me again, that my ex boyfriend was no longer welcome in my life, that the collar he gave me was in the trash and he\u2019d never see it again. I heard nothing back, and still haven\u2019t.\n\nI won\u2019t lie to you. I knew I should\u2019ve left. Why didn\u2019t I? Why did I stay? Why was I so patient?\n\nI didn\u2019t want to be alone. I was so scared of isolation that I bit the first hook that sank into my waters.\n\nI will be scarred from this. I lost my two most trusted confidants, after all. After all the pain and suffering of yesterday, in conjunction to feeling like total shit from being ill, I feel very numb.\n\nI want you all to know something. You\u2019re all strong for being here, still, after all you\u2019ve been through. I hope that we all find peace and sanctuary one day.

In kindergarten a girl i knew use take me in the bathroom, make out with me and rub me down there. I also come from a home where getting hit was normal. Seeing my mom get abused by her boyfriend from a young age. At 7 I told my cousin I was touched by him and I was taken away from my mom. Thing is i don't remember being touch by him but i remember saying it. I was taken away living with my cousin to live in a house where they walked around naked. My cousin's husband always held my hand and was always nice to me. I remember i was sleeping in the bed with them. My cousin was sleeping in the middle he was on one side i was on the other and we started holding hands over my cousin. I remember she didn't like that and separated our hands. After that i had to start wearing clothes around the house. Not long after that i started living with my aunt. That's where i remember masturbating. I didn't know that it was that i came to realize that later on. In school I use to get bullied by the kids. I never wanted to go sometimes I'd beat up. That was pretty how my whole school life was. At 11 i was given back to my mother. At this time she was an alcoholic and coke user. I started having sex at 12 when lost my virginity i was pressured by a kid around my age to do it. At 13 my mother would send me to her friend's house to pick up a envelop that was sealed shut. He was always so nice to me always tickling until one day. He was tickling me from the playing i ended up on his bed getting tickled. I started noticing he was getting free feels on my breast the he started to ask for a kiss and i wasn't comfortable with that. After asking so many times i finally gave him a tap kiss. It went from him wanting to kiss me to kissing my breast. I felt extremely uncomfortable he was in his forties i was 13. I remember not thinking or processing what was happening. I remember trying to cover my breast feeling him hard on my leg and because i was already sexually active i already knew what he wanted. I eventually let him kiss my breast which he tried to suck on then he asked if he could down there i definitely wasn't letting that happen. I told him next time i have to go my mom is going to hit me for not coming back right away. He let me leave. I remember telling myself to forget about it, forget about it, forget about it. Fast forward to Thanksgiving and my mother sends me back to her friend's house because he had cooked and he was going to give my mother a envelope. I get to the house at this point i truly forgot what Happened months earlier i was soon reminded. He asked for a hug and that when he slipped his hands down my sweat pants and started rubbing me. He held me with one arm as he did this. I remember getting away i he reminded me i said next time which i didn't remember because i block the other incident out. I go to the bathroom and he followed me in there and watch waiting for me to get up. I had to get up and he started rubbing me again. I struggle for awhile until i felt like the only way he would let me leave unless I had sex with him. I ended up dropping my sweat pants and letting him do what he wanted. I felt disgusted he wanted me to lift my shirt so he can see them while he did what he did. He couldn't finish because the phone kept ringing but i definitely remember he didn't come.\nI never told anyone that happen and it continued until 15 i think. I remember his wife making a comment to my mother and I. The way she said it was as if he had compassion. She said \"he loves children especially little girls\" in my head i remember thinking \" I bet\"\nI stood away from him for a while after that. I ended up having sex with whoever whenever. It was like i couldn't say no, i didn't know how to. My first relationship was abusive both mentally and physically. I eventually got out that then my parents passed away real hard time for me. At 22 i found myself sleeping with my mother's friend the one from when i was 13 smh i have no idea why. That's why i never felt like i was abuse because I came back so i guess I like it. At 35 I'm realizing none of it was right. As i got older i started masturbating to my abuse with that man. He's probably dead who knows sometimes bad ppl out live everyone. After reading other stories on here everything started making sense to me. I am planning on seeing a therapist soon i know i need it. im just so use to holding everything in that talking to someone about this isn't something im comfortable. \n\nAlso i left a lot of stuff out from the ages of 24 to 29 I already written a lot im feeling overwhelm.

Just finished my Degree and completing my masters. Been having a difficult time recently and thought just posting this would probably be pretty theraputic, as Ive only recently sat down and thought this way and talking really seems to help with that process. This is going to be a long post, but feel like some of the things I talk about would be helpful to see if anyone else experiences them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, its September 2016 and I decide to move away from home for University. I moved into a 5 person flat with my friend (who for now Ill call Ted). Along with me and Ted, there was a girl in this flat. She seemed to show an interest in me, but at the time I was dating someone back home. We spoke a little and on Day 3, all of the flat went on a night out. This is the night she kissed me for the first time. I had never had a girlfriend at this point and never really received much female attention, so this caught me by surprise. The next night (day 4 of knowing the girl), we slept together. I remember beforehand explaining my dating situation back home and telling her I didnt want anything serious. She agreed. The next day I came home from uni for a house party and told the girl I had been dating that I had slept with someone else, but that I had already told her it didnt mean anything. The girl in my flat at uni read this message and was understandably pissed. The girl I was dating at home broke off contact with me (although she was pitting 4 lads against each other without telling us so no regrets there). I continued to sleep with this girl in my flat and eventually, I caught feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe made it official on November 15th and began seeing each other seriously. The year flew by and in no time at all we were close to moving home for the summer. This is when things started to get complicated. We had an argument at a party and Ted's girlfreind got involved. The girl I was with flipped out and ending up having a massive argument with Ted.  Even though I was there and could see it play out, I was already madly in love and convinced myself that Ted was in the wrong. The girl I was seeing said I hadnt protected her, switched flats and tried to break up with me, but I rekindled the relationship and we continued to see each other. Several arguments entailed and one ending with Ted being knocked unconscious after my girl told someone Ted had been aggressive and violent towards her. Again, I think I knew this not to be true but convinced myself for her. We left that flat in June 2017. She moved back home and so did I, so we saw each other less than we were used to but I thought we were still happy together. Now I'm not great with money. So during this summer, she did have to lend me some at certain points. I always paid her back, but it meant we couldnt really see each other as much as we probably should have. In September 2017, just 2 weeks before we were due to move back to uni, the girl told me she hadnt been happy and wanted a break to think about things. Cant remember her exact words, but she definitely promised me we werent splitting up. The day before I was due to move back to uni, she broke up with me. I got the train to her city to see her and talk and she remained the same. I was devastated. I had to get the train back home, heartbroken and alone whilst she went to meet her friends at their house.\n\nI moved back to uni the next day and tried to rekindle my 14 year relationship with Ted. He helped me that first week, until the girl moved back too. She moved back a week after me and I remember walking into her and her family as she moved in. This broughtback so many emotions. She talked and although she said she loved me and missed me, she said it wasnt enough for her and we continued to be friends whilst I tried to get over everything. She was at this point talking to a lad named Liam back home. One night, emotions got to high and I tried to convince her to give me a chance. Shetold me to get out and I asked her to just sit and talk. At this point she hit me in the face and forced me out of her room. I sat outside listening to her on the phone to this lad telling him I was stalking her and that she loved him. Once we'd calmed down and talked, we began cuddling each other at night. We werent having sex, we werent dating or anything, just sleeping in a single bed together. Then one night we went out to a club and whilst there, she began flirting with people in front of me. I got upset and went home. As soon as I got home I regretted my decision and ran back to the club where she got angry with me and stormed away. We had to go looking for her at 2am on a Saturday night in the centre of town and found her sat in an alley way alone and crying. I tried calming her down and she then made an accusation I'll never froget. In front of several of my friends, she explained how one night she woke up with me touching her innappropriately. She said she sat crying all night whilst I sexually assaulted her. I was devastated. I was now in a position where my own friends thought I could be capable of this and had to explain how I didnt remember it and must have been asleep, doing what I always did in my sleep whilst sleeping next to her. 30 minutes later, after much crying to Ted and my other friends, she came and asked to talk. I explained how devastated I was and she said she hadn't meant it. 10 minutes later we were having sex in her flat.\n\nFrom there, we began sleeping together again. It wasnt long before we were ready to try again, although it wasnt until January 2018 that we made it official. We had missed our 1 year anniversary but were happy again. At least I assumed we were. Once back together, she admitted to me that she had almost slept with this Liam she had been speaking to but couldnt go through with it due to missing me. I believed her. We booked a holiday together to Greece in the summer. Not only that, but we also got a 2 bedroom house that we would rent together for our 3rd year at uni. Everything seemed fine. We occasionally argued but nothing major and it seemed like we were really happy, better than the first time.\n\nWe went on Holiday to Greece in June 2018 and Ive never been happier. In August 2018, I moved into our house and 2 weeks later she joined me. It was a taste of the future and I loved every second of it. We were together in our own home, with all the space we needed. It was a big step up but we dealt with it well. We continued to rekindle with Ted and his girlfriend and everything seemed great. I was also now a manager at work and our lives felt complete. Then one night, whilst I was at work with Ted, her and Ted's girlfriend sat at ours and had some wine together. By the time me and Ted got back to mine, they were pretty pissed. It was funny at first, but then Ted and his gf left and she got a bit over-stimulated. She slammed a door with her hand on the glass of the door and it cracked. I snapped at her to be careful and she didnt speak to me for a few days, saying she was angry that I had shouted at her. A few weeks later, we went on a night out and whilst getting kebabs afterwards, I found out I had been given a 12 hour shift at work. I made the joke 'Georgie must love me, giving me a 12 hour shift!'. My gf flipped. She stormed outside and began telling people I had cheating on her with Georgie (One of the women in the office at work). When I tried to speak to her, she threw the pandora promise ring I had bought her at me and told me we were done. We went home in silence and she stormed straight into the spare room.\n\nBefore continuing, I should point out that she has had issues with hormones before. Everything from depression, to skin issues, irregular periods. On this particular occasion, she was a couple of days late for her period as well as incredibly drunk. She stormed into the room and told me she thought she was pregnant and that she was going to keep it in spite of me. She also said she wished she had never met me and that doing so was the worst mistake she had ever made. I had work the next day so I went to bed without retalliating and in the morning messaged her telling her to either apologise for the horrible things she had said or move out before I got back. When I got back, she apologised in full and told me she thought I deserved better. I forgave her and we moved on.\n\nAround this time Late 2018/Early 2019, she began applying to be part of the Constabulary. I was super proud of her and this was the gateway she needed to pursue her dream career. Everything was going okay. Towards the end of our final year, we decided to do a masters, in order to give us extra time to prepare for the real world and gain more experience. We signed a contract for a 1 bedroom studio flat which we would begin sharing in September 2019. In July 2019 we moved out of our amazing house and moved home for the summer before we moved back for our masters. In this sumer, I began having troubles with work. Paying me 2 weeks late and such. This meant again, I had to lend money off her. She was happy to do so and I was always apologetic, knowing I would definitely pay her back. Also, during the summer, she succeeded in getting into the Constabulary as a Special.\n\nThis brings me to this period of my life. For the last 2 years, I made every home cooked meal (except maybe 5 she made). I'd do her washing and ironing whilst she was at work and make her coffees throughout the day. I was happy to do all this at first, but it began to become a choir. She'd go upstairs to the toilet, come down and tell me to go upstairs to get her something. Wake up at 9am and sit there until 9.30am before telling me she didnt have time to get ready for her shift at 10am so Id have to make her a coffee and iron her uniform whilst she did her hair and makeup.\n\nSo, when we moved into our flat this September, I began doing less and less of that. I'd tell her to do it herself and be more likely to snap everytime she wasted time and then said I had to help her. Shes always said I dont pay her any interest. Her main example of this is the MCU. I showed her Iron Man 1 in 2016 and since then we've seen every film. She loves it. But she says I make her watch my stuff all the time and never want to watch hers. In my degree I only got a 2:2 which I put down to my own laziness. So for my masters I knew I had to put some effort in. For the first 4 weeks I worked on my uni work non-stop. Doing everyting I could to get ahead of the curve so that I wouldnt stress as much. In October, Took her on a \u00a3100 date to show her some attention and she seemed completely happy. She began going out with her new police friends allot. In particular, 2 lads and a girl. She began messaging one of these lads non stop (A 14 day snapchat streak by the time we split up). Remember this. The last 3 weeks of our relationship she was barely ever with me. Because she was normally always out on shift or with her friends, leaving me alone in the flat.\n\nOn 28th October, she woke up at 9am to get ready for work (her shift started at 10am). I was half asleep but knew she was sat in bed on her phone until 9.20am. She then woke me up because 'she didnt have time' to get ready and when I barely responded, began slapping me playfully on the cheek. However, she got a good connection on one slap and I snapped. \"Please dont hit me like that, it really fucking hurts\" is what I said. She got up, stormed out, did her shit, got ready in silence and then as she left she said 'I dont appreciate you talking to me like that' and went to work. At 5pm she came home and went straight into the living room without acknowledging me. I was on my computer in the bedroom, but decided I had to apologise (For some unknown reason). I went to shop to get ingredients for our tea and at the same time got her roses (her favourite flowers), a bottle of wine and some cheesecake (her favourite dessert). I asked if she wanted to talk and she told me she could 'barely fucking look at me'. So I decided to leave her to it and go back to my computer. at 7pm, she came in and said she was going out, didnt say where and didnt say when she'd be home. She left in a mood and would barely speak to me over text. She came back at 3am, sat down with me and told me that because I wasnt giving her any attention and because she hadnt been happy for over 2 months, she was giving me a couple months to make her happy or she'd be ending our relationship. I was obviously upset. But I would do anything for her so I accepted those terms. She went back to the living room and I went and got in bed. But then I heard her on the phone. 'Why are you always looking at my arse then?' and 'Josh said yours is small, but I want to see it myself' is what I heard. I started panicking. I went into the living room and she began talking loudly about something else. So I put my phone on record and left it on the kitchen counter. After a couple minutes, I retrieved my phone and went to listen to what she had been saying... 'Sorry, he came into the room so I had to change the subject... I would meet you but Ive been drinking'. I had to know the truth.\n\nI entered the living room and said 'Please can you put the phone down, I need to ask you something'. She obliged. I asked her who she was on the phone to and she said the lad she had been speaking to for all this time. I asked her if she was cheating on me and she flipped. She ended it on the spot. No explanation at first, just 'get out of my face, were done!'. I was devastated even more now and tried to apologise profusely. She was having none of it. 'I gave you a chance 10 minutes ago to make me happy and you accuse me of cheating on you. Were done. Permanently'. I went to Teds flat (its 6am by now) and told him what had happened and he agreed with my decision to confront her, but now with the recording (I now also regret that decision). I was now living with my ex. She began going out every night to meet her friends and when I tried to talk to her she'd say I was making her look like a bad person and that the conversations were making her angry.\n\nThen one night she went out to meet her friend (a girl in the police with her). She left at about 7pm and didnt say anything about when she'd be back. I sat and watched Avengers End Game, trying my hardest not to be overwhelmed by the constant over thinking. But it got to in my opinion the most emotional scene of the film (Cap dancing with Peggy) and I broke. I decided to go for a nice long walk. It was about 1am by now so I was hoping she would come home, see I wasnt there and get worried about me. Alas, I walked to the docks and saw her car there, in an empty carpark at 2am with another car next to hers and all the lights out. I panicked and returned home. She came in at 3.30am and told me she had been with this girl and that the girl had spilt KFC gravy down her leg, so they had to go back to hers so she could get changed. I believed her.\n\nWhen she was in the flat, I had to try my best to not show emotion towards her and I really struggled. This lead to more arguments as I couldnt contain my emotions and yet again, this made her angry at me. I then went on a halloween night out with my friends to Blackpool Tower. Ted, his gf and a female friend from home that I had a crush on in 2014. My ex was supposed to come instead of her, but after getting an amazing outfit and seeing my face drop at seeing her in it, she decided against it. The night out was amazing and I flirted away with my friend without a care in the world. (Alcohol is amazing aint it!). On the way home, we bumped into my ex (she was on shift with the police) and I just said hello to her. This became the source of another argument the next day, as she said I shouldnt have gone near her and she felt like I was stalking her. She even asked if I had done anything with the girl I went to Bongos with, as if she was angry about me sleeping with someone else. Even though I hadnt. That night she went out for 8 hours again so whilst she was gone I told my parents what had happened. My mum told me to get my friends up and then come home with them the next day. That night my friends came, I got high and drunk with them and we watched Always Sunny until 3am before falling asleep in the living room. She came home at 6am. In the morning whilst she was asleep, I looked at her messages. The lad had sent her a snapchat saing 'Night night Beautiful xxxxx' and she had told the friend she had supposedly gone out with (KFC Gravy incident) that 'hes spilt KFC gravy down himself so were at his so he can get changed'. She had lied to me. Despite me asking her and her promising me that she would just tell me the truth. She told me she had met one of her girl friends, but had actually met the lad she had been talking to the night I confronted her for cheating on me. I confronted her and she told me she hated me with a passion and that her mum had said ending it with me was the 'best thing she'd ever done'. I went home that day to give her some space so that we could talk properly about everything. I was supposed to stay Sunday - Tuesday but Sunday night I had a major panic attack and decided I had to go back to my flat on the Monday. I didnt intend to speak to her, I just intended to be there with my friends. But I went to the flat and her disregard for my existance made me decide to talk to her there and then. This one was particularly volatile. She said she was so angry she could punch me in the face and that again, she hated me. She said she couldnt look at me without getting angry and at one point punched the wardrobe. I got angry too. I was being treated with a lack of respect you'd hate to receive from someone you love and have loved for almost 3 years. I told her I was done with her, she was making a massive mistake and that it was her loss, before storming to Teds to get my anger out.\n\nI got to Teds and knew instantly I was going to go back. And I did. And she was expecting me. I know she was. I could hear her in the shower, so I stormed in and banged around to let her know I was there. Thats when I heard her sit down in the shower. I knocked and asked if she was okay and got no response. I told her I was coming in with my eyes closed and got no response. I opened the door, covered my eyes and got a towel ready for her. She was sat crying in the shower. I told her to cover herself up and then sat on the bathroom floor to calm her down. She told me she had been thinking about cutting her wrists and ending it and I had to explain to her how so many people didnt want that. We talked and laughed and then she stood up and began showering again. At first I covered my eyes and she turned away, but then she slowly turned back to me and I slowly started looking at her. Until she was stood bare naked in front of me. I even began joking about becoming Friends with Benefits and she seemed to be even considering the idea. But then she went out and left me alone again.\n\nIf your still following at this point, then get ready for a plot twist. She began messaging Liam again. I didnt know what at first, but I knew she was deleting the conversations whenever she put her phone down (in an effort to stop me going on it I think). But then I saw it. Liam asked her 'How old is this Police Officer you have your eyes on?'. She replied 'Hes 22'. So I began probing as jokingly as I could to get the truth. How old is he I asked about the lad she had been sneaking off to see. She told me he was 22. Are you interested in him I asked? 'no, I dont see him like that and dont want a relationship' she replied.\n\nShe had been telling me about this plan her and her friends had made for a couple days and  I fully believed her. The 4 of them (her and her 3 police friends) were going Crazy golf and cinema. On the day, she started getting ready. More makeup than usual, fake eyelashes, curled her hair and put a nice outfit on. More effort than she ever made with me. Again I began jokingly probing... 'Who are you trying to impress?', 'Are you sure its not a double date?!', 'How are the other 2 meeting you when you've only messaged that lad?'. She made up an excuse for every question or told me to fuck off. This lad picked her up and they disappeared. I did my best to avoid the temptation but it was too much. I signed into her Snapchat. On this lads story, was the 2 of them, having a laugh together on the most obvious date Ive ever seen. She had again lied to me instead of telling me the truth to help me get over her. But then I got her text. 'Why the fuck are you on my snapchat'. Busted. I didnt know what to do, she began telling me to fuck off and calling me manipulative and then turned her phone off.\n\nI told my brother and he came to get me before she got home. He got all my belongings in his car and moved me out before I did something stupid. Until Thursday, I was still messaging her telling her I thought she was the most perfect and amazing person I had ever met and she was still getting angry at me. 'You dont make me happy'. 'Were different people and your not the same as me'. 'Your dragging me down'. 'You have no motivation'. I continued to tell her to message me and speak to me, but she hasnt done yet. Shes continued to see and date the lad she promised me she had no interest in and even had the balls to message me the night I moved out of the flat, asking where her vibrator was. As if Id took it and as if I wanted to know when she was planning on using it.\n\nSince Thursday 14th Ive not spoken to her. I had to go back and stay at Ted's house (unfortunately he lives next door to her) so I saw her 3 times, but stayed out her way each time. And its so difficult. I have counselling in a few weeks and after speaking to someone on the phone, they told me she was definitely 'manipulative'. I miss her like crazy. She was my world for so long and I would have done anything for her\n\nI still have to pay for the flat (even though I dont live there), but Ive given my keys in so that any damages to it cant be put on me. Ive also told her that if I ever find out she takes a lad back, I will stop paying for it. I have never been this low and have always considered myself extremely lucky, to have never had suicidal or dark thoughts. But recently Ive experienced it and its extremely difficult to deal with. She never told me she was unhappy. I took her on a date and she acted as if everything was okay. She never mentioned being upset or said anything I was doing was pissing her off. But then she ended it for not being happy. And when I said she should have told me and we should just try again now that I know, she told me she couldnt even look at me the same way. I thought I was so lucky to have her. I was punching well above what I should expect and for a first time, she was fucking beautiful in every sense of the word. But now Ive lost her. And though Im certain she emotionally manipulated me. I still have trouble believing she did it to abuse me. I think more likely, after seeing her messages, she realised she could be happier with the other lad and ended it with me. But the way she ended it was manipulative and crushing. And I cant see myself being the same.\n\nIm getting there though. Because I have to. She will realise what she is missing. A lad that does everything for her, even though shes been so cruel to him. Who still compliments her even though she has said multiple times that shes never going to see him the same way. Who still cleans up after her, makes her food and drink, irons her uniform even though she doesnt respect me enough to tell the truth and help me with my mental health. Who helped her with her degree and did everything he could to make her happy.\n\nAfter this time, Ive realised that she cultivated the idea that I was dependant on her. She made sure to remind me during arguments how much she had done for me, whilst dismissing everything I did for her. Made me feel guilty for being upset about losing her and making me feel like I was wrong for not making her happy, when she was the wrong one for not talking about it with me.\n\nIt would be good to hear the opinions of those who have bothered to read this far. And if you have, thank you for taking an interest in my situation. Its getting easier but Ill always think of her. And it will always hurt. I cant think about anyone else. Everything reminds me of her. And how someone else now has that pleasure of waking up looking into her eyes. Its supposed to be our 3 year anniversary on Friday 15th. But we havent spoke in almost 4 days and the day agter our anniversary is supposed to be, shes going out on a night out with her police mates and this lad shes now dating. And it makes me sick whenever I think about it. But I cant stop thinking about her because shes in my head nonstop.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

In this case, them telling me this followed an ignored text where I told them I missed them, and then a followup nearly two weeks later just to say hi.

Treated me and everyone else in her life like absolute trash. \n\nShe didn't have any friends outside of her and I's friendship. A long list of short-lived aquaintences were on rotation but pretty quickly these people realized what they were dealing with and cut ties.\n\nI don't know why I put up with her bullshit for so long. She was an awful friend from day 1 but a relatively good manipulator. Huge sense of grandiosity while shitting on every other person who crossed her path. If you're on this sub, you know what kind of person I'm talking about.\n\nIn any other situation like this, I would have sat the \"friend\" down and explained why I didn't want to continue the friendship any longer, but with her I honestly saw no point. I have zero doubt she would twist the story and narrative to cause more problems and frankly I realized I needed to choose myself in this scenerio and cut this person out. These weren't problems that would have been fixed and she would take my honesty and turn it into a weapon. \n\nSo I blocked her on everything (phone, email, social, etc.) with no notice. She has known this entire time what she has been doing and even if she is so self absorbed she can't think of any of the dozens of reasons why I wouldn't want to know her anymore, a normal person would have gotten the hint by now. \n\nAs I mentioned, I was her only real friend, so this might explain her obsessive actions and inability to take the larger-than-life hint. \n\nIt's been about 5 months since I went no-contact for my own mental well-being, and while her number is blocked, I can still see her calls in my missed calls list. Shes been calling my phone 10+ times a day. For the past 5 months. This didn't really effect me as the phone doesn't ring when she calls and I haven't responded to a single attempt of her reaching out.\n\nBut now - she has begun to harrass my friends and family. She found my spouses # online and has been texting him asking what is going on/where I am/etc. He hasn't responded and eventually the harrassment was getting on his nerves so he too blocked her #. \n\nShe has now tracked down friends of mine on social media (people she barely knows as we share 0 mutual friends. The friends of mine who have met her once or twice never liked her as they found her cold, calculating, extremely judgemental and eerily possessive of me.) She is now sending my friends messages that drip with ingenuine concern. Not one of them has responded to her yet she continues to harrass them. \n\nI wish I could say this is a 14 year old who just couldn't get the hint. No, this is an intelligent and extremely calcuating N of a 30 year old woman.\n\nI've thought about emailing her and just saying - take the fucking hint and leave us all alone, but honestly, it would only encourage more insanity.\n\nAnyone else dealt with this psychotic bullshit? Any stories or advice are appreciated. I have no interest in knowing her and I refuse to engage her abusive behavior a moment longer.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I am sharing my story here as I have felt really supported by reading your stories and I want to share my struggle with you in the hopes of learning from you. English is not my first language, my apologies for any errors and for the length of this post, there\u2019s a tldr at the bottom.\n\nI met my narc in 2013 and we had a short but very intense affair that ended horribly. During this affair my narc told me he has borderline personality disorder and didn\u2019t want treatment for it, and showed a lot of narc traits in his behavior. Quite soon after it all ended I met someone else and had a loving relationship with him for about four years. In the beginning of 2016 my narc started messaging me and apologized for the horrible ending of our short affair. To be honest I appreciated him expressing his regret. We began discussing our shared passion around which my career revolves. I appreciated his apologies and didn\u2019t think much of it, but the talking online intensified and we met up once a couple months later,  it was all friendly and fine. Not romantic in any way, but he did inquire about my relationship status. \n\nAfter that we sometimes were out of touch for a while and had a couple of explosive conversations where he got really angry with me for trivial reasons, I didn\u2019t think much of it. He always reached out again after some time and the cycle would repeat itself. Sometimes we were out of touch for a couple of months. \n\nFast forward to 2017 and I moved to the city where my narc lives. We started chatting again and even though I now realize he was hovering me - he again asked me if I was in a relationship, married, had kids - we were in friendly contact again, mostly discussing our shared interest.\nWe met up a couple of times in a friendly way and then both met someone and got into a serious relationship with them, all the while still talking, mostly about our daily lives and our shared interest.\n\nThings were friendly and platonic, at least to me, I enjoyed talking to him, things never took a sexual or flirty turn and since I didn\u2019t know many people in the city yet I also met up with him a couple times more to explore our shared interest and we had fun together like I would have with a friend. To be honest I considered him a friend. Over time however I noticed him lying and exaggerating certain things more and more. Four months ago I decided to call him out on it. This of course ended in a big drama - what did I expect - and he called me a couple of horrible names. I decided to stop responding to let the situation cool off and have been NC since.\n\nThe reason I am sharing my story here is that I am having a lot of difficulty staying NC. My narc and I attend the same events in our city a lot - let\u2019s say it would be possible we run into each other weekly and I can\u2019t avoid going to these places given the line of work I am in. I saw him a couple of weeks ago at an event but didn\u2019t talk. It gives me a lot of anxiety to think that I might run into him, while it has happened in the past and nothing happened, we just kind of ignored each other.\nI am ashamed to admit that I miss my narc a lot somehow and I am really preoccupied with him and what he is up to. I look at his social media for example. The amount of messages I used to receive from him was immense and makes me think of what other people here describe as love bombing, even though we never really flirted or anything like that. I really miss the messages we used to exchange. I know contact with my narc will eventually lead to another explosion and it\u2019s better this way, but I think about him daily and the longer we are NC, the worse it seems to get. I am generally very busy and have a lot of nice things going on in my life, but I wish I could stop thinking about him and missing him. I wonder if this is relatable to anyone and how long it\u2019s taken you all to shake this of. And I know that I should seek within myself why I am still holding onto this thing that brings me nothing. Any advice would be welcome. \n\nTLDR; my narc and I have been in touch on an off for years after affair w him ended terribly, now NC for four months and can\u2019t stop thinking about him and am ashamed to admit I miss him.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Without doubt, he is a malignant narcissist and has been since he was very young. He, as an adult, has hit his mom in the face, smashed up his brother's car, hit his sister and I have heard him verbally and emotionally abuse them all on multiple occasions.\n\nWe stayed with his family for a while and they have seen, first hand, him verbally, emotionally, psychologically abuse me and even come close to hitting me over the head with a blunt object (his mom wrestled it off him before he could). They have seen me with bruises on my face from him hitting me over and over. They know exactly what is going on in my household. They also know the damage his behavior is doing to me and the kids.\n\nBut here is the thing, it seems like his mom enjoys instigating some of the abuse. For example, she will tell him things I told her in confidence. If he starts on her, she has said \"go take your shit out on your wife\". She has told me before how to \"improve\" for him and that I am not faultless in the way he treats me (which is absurd because I am very passive, but my compliance is always stuff like I deserve it because I don't dress the way he wants or have my hair cut the way he likes). If there is a problem with something he is doing against them, I always am the one who gets the berating texts or calls from her and, because I am such a damn people pleaser, I do the whole \"yes ma'am\" routine.\n\nIt feels sometimes that she also enjoys letting the bomb drop and watching the chaos from afar. What pisses me off more is that she claims to love my kids, but it seems she loves the drama more because if she loved the kids, she would not want to know or see her son have them walk on egg shells, make fun of them or ruin their security...or abuse their mom.\n\nOther people around him have done the same too. The church he cheated with took pains to \"make points\" that he would come and abuse me for.

I have done a lot of reading about narcissism/abuse and feel that I have made great strides in recovering from my PTSD caused by years of chronic abuse. I have learned so much about abusers and feel very confident in being able to discern if someone is bad news or not. I was fairly certain that when I started dating again, I would be able to establish firm boundaries and run at the first red flag. I started dating someone a few months ago and realized that running isn\u2019t as easy as I thought. \n\nI was in a lot of pain and suffering post-narc and felt extremely lonely but I pushed through it for the sake of my recovery and I'd been doing well. However, I was magnetically attracted to this person in a way that I have *never* experienced before in my life. I was/am so drawn to him and that's probably why I basically ignored the red flags. The attention and dates felt so good and exciting. The first few times we went out, he didn\u2019t display any warning signs. He was polite, respectful, complimented me a lot, wanted to see me frequently, etc. and I found him very fun and easy to get along with. I really liked him and found him refreshing after my ex. Based on all I have read for the past 9 months, I suspect that I was lovebombed \u2013 my nex didn\u2019t lovebomb me when we first started dating so I hadn\u2019t really experienced it like this before. The flattery and positive attention dropped off pretty quickly before he started showing his true colours. Here is a list of some red flags I spotted:\n\n* constantly talking about how attractive/smart/cool he is; calling himself \u201cthe best\u201d. Over the top grandiosity\n* after a couple of weeks, he *completely* stopping complimenting me and started negging. Some examples: saying I\u2019m bigger than girls he\u2019s used to but he \u201clikes it\u201d (I\u2019m pretty thin and fit by any standards, and it's rude even if I wasn't), making negative comments about my body saying he\u2019s \u201cjoking\u201d. All of these comments were out of nowhere and obviously totally uncalled for. \n* talking VERY early on about the future, for example moving in together someday. Moving way too fast. Future faking? \n* Inappropriate negative feedback and criticism \u2013 eerily similar to my nex. I made some food and brought him some and he told me what was wrong with it instead of saying thank you. I got very positive feedback from my family \u2013 I know I did a good job. I sent him a photo of something I cooked and he told me again what was wrong with it \u2013 something that was not even visible from the photo. Again, something my nex always did.\n* making the *same* negative comment about my appearance that I called him out on that he even apologized for. I asked him why he did it again, he laughed and said \u201cto make you angry\u201d.\n* intentionally trying to make me jealous by talking about other women. Commented on a woman\u2019s body parts at a bar \u2013 something he had specifically negged me about\n* telling me he is an asshole to people sometimes because it\u2019s \u201cfunny\u201d. Saying he likes to make people feel stupid sometimes (WTF?)\n* called himself a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. Again under the guise of a joke\n* excessive drinking multiple nights per week/very impulsive behaviour\n* didn\u2019t ask me any questions about myself, not even how are you/how was your day. If I asked him, he wouldn\u2019t even ask it back to me. His cover was that \u201cit\u2019s too early to ask me personal questions because he didn\u2019t wanna make me uncomfortable\u201d I quickly learned he didn\u2019t give a shit about overstepping boundaries. He just wasn\u2019t interested in getting to know me.\n* whenever I told him anything about myself, he would one up it immediately without commenting on what I said. For example, I said that I do a certain type of painting, and said \u201cI paint too\u201d. I said \u201cwow really?\u201d He said \u201cyup in elementary school\u201d. Completely irrelevant and strange. Everything is always about him. \n* he admitted a few days ago to being on his best behaviour at the beginning and saying it was \u201chard\u201d for him.\n* accusing me randomly of having \"attitude\" when I really don't - there is a post on this sub where people agree that narcs use this phrase a lot - my nex certainly did.\n\nI feel pretty embarrassed and ashamed after writing this out. I realize too that some of his mannerisms/phrases are weirdly *very* similar to those of my nex.\nThe worst part is that I felt early on that he had narcissistic tendencies but I didn\u2019t want to believe it or accept it because 1) I thought there was no way I could meet another guy so similar to my nex the first time I start dating 2) I really enjoyed being around him at first \u2013 it was so easy and fun, the total opposite of how it was with my nex. I guess the lovebombing was very effective. \u2639 I consciously took note of these red flags but didn\u2019t take them seriously because I didn\u2019t want to pursue a real relationship with this person for various reasons. So I figured I would try to just live in the moment and enjoy the dates and companionship without getting attached. Not a good plan.\n\nI just wanted to write this out as a warning to anyone who finds themselves in a similar predicament, and to demonstrate what some red flags look like. Even though I can *clearly* see the red flags, even though he has disrespected me on multiple occasions, even though I\u2019m completely cringing at myself after writing this out, I still feel somewhat attached and wish he would behave like he did at the beginning. I stupidly feel like I did something wrong that made him start disrespecting me - maybe he smelled my weakness even though I did a good job at not acting \u201cdesperate\u201d. I know I need to cut him off but I feel disappointed because I thought this was someone I could have a good time with. Now I clearly see how lovebombing works \u2013 I am still holding on because I enjoyed the way things were so much at the beginning even though I can see that he is pretty messed up.\nWhatever is within me that is attracted to toxic people needs to be addressed before I even consider dating again. I don\u2019t know what a healthy relationship feels like and this toxic situation feels familiar and comfortable to me. If my boundaries were well-developed I would have been able to cut this off as soon as I noticed the first couple of red flags. This has been a valuable learning experience and without this sub and my terrible experience with my nex, I likely would have fallen victim to this person and had a *really*, really bad time. Luckily I will be able to get past this easily because my emotional investment is minimal (at least I think it is). I fully acknowledge that it was stupid to not run sooner. Luckily he seems to have lost interest so I only see him once a week and rarely speak to him outside of that time. I want to end things as easily as possible but I\u2019m not sure how.\n\nI would love to see anyone\u2019s take on this/what people think of the red flags listed above/if anyone has a similar experience dating post-narc.\n\nTL;DR: Met a potential narc/abuser 9 months post-narc, didn\u2019t take red flags seriously, realized I need more time to recover and learn how to establish boundaries once and for all.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Thanks!  \n\nNow for the details. Ive an acquaintance who is a narcissistic low functioning crook. I bought once a collectible from him and after that he presented me another one, pretty expensive. I paid for it but he is not giving it me using all kinds of the usual narc defenses. He feels entitled because physically he has the item so as a narcissist he thinks that he owns it, not me - despite the fact that I already paid for it. He tries to get more money and attention from me, probably because I said that he is a crook in a circle of collectors and that hurt his ego. Sure I can go to the police but in my country the police system is totally corrupted and unhelpful.\n\nI want to push him into giving this collectible to me but I dont have much experience with narcs and each our conversation that often happens online leaves me in anger and even in tears because I feel helpless facing his illogical and harsh replies and gaslighting. I also suffer from cPTSD and any emotional conversation makes me dissociate - but its not about coping with the guy, its about how to push him to give me what belongs to me.

I don\u2019t know where to start. I guess I first noticed it and was like \u201cI know what this is and I don\u2019t like it\u201d when I got in a fight with my mom because she wanted me to come play pool with her friends and I said I didn\u2019t want to go, she said if I didn\u2019t go then she would stop giving me my shots (I get weekly shots, I just have a hard time with needles). Mom doesn\u2019t view them as important because I can live without them, I\u2019ll be miserable but I don\u2019t think she understands that or cares. She emotionally blackmailed me and a few days later when I confronted her about it (because I was staying with my brother) she said she said it out of anger so it doesn\u2019t matter. I didn\u2019t end up going, I did stay with my brother. My brother has really opened my eyes to all of it, I hate that I didn\u2019t see it before and I\u2019m kind of mad at myself for that. \nThis is where my life mirrors that one girls in AITA. My little sister is severely autistic, she\u2019s almost 15 now and requires care 24/7. My parents have used me as free care for her, the burden of her care has fallen on me because I\u2019m the next oldest and still living at home. I\u2019m not mad at my sister, I understand she can\u2019t help how she is, if anyone is to blame it\u2019s my parents. I have no local friends because I can\u2019t do anything with anyone, I have to be home for little sis (LS). I\u2019m very thankful for having mostly online friendships because I\u2019m moving soon, so I can take them with me still. My brother is a godsend in my life right now, he has no idea how much he has done and is continuing to do for me. We, him, his fianc\u00e9e and I, are moving 10h away, 4 state\u2019s south. He told me when he was talking with his fianc\u00e9e about me joining them that a big reason he wants me to go is to get me away from mom and dad and LS. On a trip we went to just a few months ago to VA we met with the friends we would be moving in with (long long time friends in my brothers, they already live down in GA), we were talking about our wants to a place to move in to, big yard, dog and cat friendly etc. He told me something that I\u2019ve never heard before and think it\u2019s telling that it\u2019s my first time hearing it. He said he with how I talk about dogs and how I am with dogs he wants to see me take some classes on training or grooming and pursue something in that field and thrive. I\u2019ve never been told to thrive before, or even pursue what I want with my life. I\u2019m 22. It has always been about LS. \nBrother has opened my eyes to mom and dads manipulation of me. I have a job that I\u2019m paid for, I am LS home care, for only 21 hours a week, not even close to what I actually do. It was nice at first, being able to work from home since I can\u2019t drive. But now I\u2019m itching to live my life. I don\u2019t wanna be LS caretaker forever, I wanna do my own thing and mom and dad make me feel guilty for it. I\u2019ve tried to talk about it with them, but now dad has told me he doesn\u2019t ever wanna hear me say that they have made LS my responsibility because according to them they haven\u2019t, and about moving they go on about being hard it will be adjusting and that me leaving will be a big wrench in LS routine. I feel like an ass for wanting to leave but I will because I know it\u2019s the best for me in the long run. \nBrother is also teaching me to drive and he\u2019ll take me to the DMV soon. I couldn\u2019t drive when I was 16 because I was having issues with epilepsy and that\u2019s just an automatic no for driving. Mom and dad never took me anywhere other than my own doctor appointments. And when my seizures stopped they just never took me, I would ask and they would say I need to study for the test but never give me the resources I needed (the books that my brother took me in to get). Mom and dad ironically also make me feel like a burden. LS is unfortunately quite violent and she has sent me to the ER before (which mom twisted into being my fault and chewed me out for the whole ride there). That time I was setting up the fire pit and LS decided that she wanted my attention and I was busy so she got the grill brush and hit me in the head. I got stitches. It wasn\u2019t even that long ago and sometimes it still hurts, like a phantom pain. LS has hit my head so hard repeatedly that I\u2019ve had headaches for two days after. I never hit her back, I can control myself,  but the cost is emotional for me. It\u2019s a lot of stress. And when mom does step in and block her from me, like just the other night I was feeding the dogs, she went on telling me to hurry up and that she wants to get back to what she was doing. I\u2019m sorry LS beats me??? Like why yell at me for that? LS can do no wrong, my brother could tell more, I wonder if he has a reddit account. \nWhen I talk to mom about how I feel like don\u2019t have my own life and I wanna do what I want she just comes back with she can\u2019t do anything either (which is a lie, she lies about when she works to sleep with another man). But like that sacrifice is one any parent makes when they decide to have kids. I don\u2019t have kids, so why am I being forced to make this sacrifice? Even after all this I\u2019m not mad or hateful towards LS, she\u2019s surprisingly sweet most of the time and my examples while all with in the past year do not represent how she is most of the time. I do love her, but I feel really guilty for moving. I feel like I\u2019m leaving a responsibility behind, one that I\u2019m aware should have never been mine but I still feel like that. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking for, just to vent I guess, I\u2019m sorry for that then. I don\u2019t like putting my pain on others,  but it\u2019s taxing to keep it bottled up too and I can\u2019t do it forever. I really am very thankful for my brother, I told him after he told me to thrive that it\u2019s my first time hearing that, and I think he cried, or wanted to. I\u2019m sorry if this is the wrong subreddit but I don\u2019t know where else to put it. I guess my mom might fit in with raised by narcissists and she is a whole thing on her own. I just feel guilty and I don\u2019t know how to stop feeling that way because I know I shouldn\u2019t. She\u2019s not my kid, not my responsibility.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I want to move out, but I'm worried", "author": "ThrowRA_Mom", "self_text": "[LONG POST] TL;DR at the bottom\n\nI (19F) have had a strained relationship with my mom (54F) for some time now. We used to be very close when I was younger, but as I got into high school, things started to change.\u00a0\n\nMy mother had always been somewhat strict, but only on specific aspects of my life. I was almost never allowed to hang out with my friends, unless it was at our house, under her terms. Any social interactions I had it front of her would be critiqued later (\"dont talk so much about x, y, z, theyll think you're boring, you're very repetitive, you might come off as annoying). This type of thing crushed my already non existent self confidence as a kid, from the time I was in kindergarten, onward. I know now that I most likely suffered from some undiagnosed anxiety disorders at the time, having reflected on that period of my life with a therapist.\n\nShe always seemed to treat me the way that was best for her. I wasnt allowed to pick my own outfits until halfway through freshman year of highschool, I wasnt allowed to walk my dog around the corner of the block until I was 17, I wasnt allowed to take the bus on my own until I was almost 19. She's insanely paranoid that I'm going to get kidnapped.\u00a0\n\nHer parents were also awful to her. She has a fucked up relationship with her family to this day, and expects my father and I to act the same way as her family. She's convinced that because shes (constantly) there \"for me\" and because she's never hit me or beat me, that makes her this A+, perfect parent.\n\nAround the time I was 12, I started feeling like there might be something off in our relationship, but I couldnt explain what. I think I avoided thinking about it because I had been bullied at school, and the environment there had been so miserable that it was doing a lot of harm to my mental health. I was most likely suffering from depression. I began seriously contemplating suicide at that point. My mom felt like my only friend in the world at that point.\n\nI transferred into online school after 2 years. It was one of the best decisions of my life. While I did lose contact with some \"friends\", I was taken out of an environment that had made me nothing but miserable and I finally had the chance to focus on getting better. Family comes from a place where mental health problems are seen as something shameful, and being taken to a therapist was often used as a threat when I was acting too strange, or crazy for my mom. I still hadnt recovered from that fear by this point, so I went online in search of help.\n\nMy mom was paranoid about my internet safety after hearing about a few cases, so I was banned entirely from talking to strangers online, all my social media was completely controlled by her, and she regularly went through my phone. In her eyes, there was no such thing as \"privacy\". I either wanted to share everything with her, or I was hiding something. The problem was I could never anticipate what she would find a problem with, so I got very, very good at hiding things.\n\nI made myself a fake tumblr account. For me it was less about the blog, and more about having an outlet where I could look at and post whatever I wanted without fear. I still hadnt really realized this wasnt normal, as it's what I had grown up with, and my mom did a lot to convince me never to get too close with friends as \"they cant be trusted/theyll betray you/people are mean\" and I should only trust those in my family completely (ie only her).\u00a0\n\nI made some friends online who I talked to. It was mostly casually, just about common interests and memes and such. A few times I had more serious conversations, but I was always incredible cautious. I have a fairly common name and live in a big city, I knew 4 other girls with my name who were also the same age, so I made sure never to give out information beyond my name, age, and city/time zone if it became relevant.\u00a0\n\nI was incredibly careful to hide my tumblr from my mom, going so far as to make a carefully curated, g rated fake account I almost never posted on in case I ever needed to show it to her, but I didnt need to use it until roughly a year later, when I started going to high school. A boy I was talking to didnt have a phone, so he started messaging me through facebook. My mom would keep my account logged in on her laptop while I was typing on my phone so that she could read our messages as they went by. It freaked me out, so I asked him to start messaging me on my tumblr so she would stop. That night was the one night I forgot to log out of my tumblr account into the fake one, so naturally it's the night she chose to go through all of my messages. To everyone.\n\nShe lost her shit. She said I betrayed her, and that she would never forgive me, that I had gone online only to say bad things about her (I had mentioned her twice, once to complain about her grounding me when my grade dropped from an A 99% to and A 96%, and once to say \"sorry, I gotta go now, my mom's making me practice piano). She locked herself in my parents' bedroom and didnt talk to me beyond yelling for two weeks.\u00a0\n\nThe biggest problem was perhaps when I had talked to someone about the day I had almost killed myself. It was hard to bring that up, but I think it helped me get on the track to recovering. My mom became convinced that I had been lying, and seeking attention. She said some truly nasty things that day which I dont want to remember.\u00a0\n\nWhile she wasnt talking to me, I told my dad (56M) about everything. He was helpful and understanding. He talked to my mom and convinced her I had been serious. Her response was to come to me crying, saying if I ever thought about suicide again she would off herself first. The conversation made me sick to my stomach. Honestly, from then on our relationship only got worse.\n\nShe made me delete the account, and then told me that she had gone to the police, who had traced the ip address and found out one of the people was a registered sex offender who could start stalking me, that my dad had freaked out and that they wanted to talk to my principal and keep the security guard with me at all times. It seemed so suspicious to me that I didnt believe her at all, but I nodded along. Years later I finally told my father about it, and his jaw dropped. He said it was completely fake and he could hardly believe she had said any of that.\n\nSince I was in elementary school, she has told me nothing but nasty things about my father. I hadnt been nearly as close to him as a kid, and he seemed so much angrier. She told me how she hated him, how she regretted marrying him, how she constantly thought he was cheating on her, how she was only staying with him because of me, that I was the only good thing that had come out of this relationship, but that she was miserable with him. For a long time I thought i should kill myself so that she wouldnt need to stay in a relationship with someone she hated, and i hated myself for being related to my father. My mom treated 6 year old me like her friend/therapist with no regard for how it could impact me.\n\nAs I got older, my dad became more relaxed, and the more I talked with him, the more I realized his story of events just didnt line up with what I had heard from my mother. I really didnt know who to believe, but I've since then I've watched her spin lies and stories she genuinely believes that are completely different from what I had witnessed.\n\nShe became convinced that when I would talk to my dad, he was trying to make me hate her, the same way she tried to make me hate him. My relationship with my father had only improved over the years, but my relationship with her has deteriorated to the point that she is avoiding me more often than she is speaking to me.\u00a0\n\nShe always told me that she would be ok with it if I was gay, but that she was glad I wasnt. I talked to her almost immediately when I started questioning my sexuality, and said I think I might be bi. My dad acknowledged that and was fine with it. He didnt have much of a reaction at all, tbh. My mom lost it, told me she was upset with me because I had \"lied\" to her, and that gay people always knew they were gay since childhood, so either I had lied to her about being straight, or I had lied just now and was trying to fit in with a trend in my generation. She avoided me for a few hours, and when I went to talk to her, she was crying, asking me \"where did I go wrong, I dont know what I did wrong\". It broke my heart, and while I knew she wouldnt be happy, I never thought she would have reacted like this. I didnt talk to her about it again for months, until I told her that confidently, I was bi. She essentially said \"alright\", and moved on.\u00a0\n\nFrom then on, she alternated between telling me I was straight because she remembered when I had a crush on a boy, and telling me I was definitely a lesbian because she \"could just feel it\". She still doesnt believe bi people exist.\n\nI have gone to a therapist, which she became convinced I was doing only to talk shit about her, and while going made it harder at home, it helped me work through my issues a lot. I have made close friends that I can talk to. To be honest, the stories I've told only scratch the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the shit she's said and done to me, but I dont think I have the space to go over everything.\u00a0\n\nBoth of my parents have been through something extremely traumatic. The difference is that my father dealt with his issues and has been getting better over time. My mother is letting everything fester, and she is becoming more toxic, cutting friends and family out of her life over ridiculous disagreements, constantly pushing people away, and it's taken me a while, but I've come to the conclusion that theres just nothing I can do for her. She used to have episodes like this sometimes when I was a kid, but now it seems like that's her constant attitude, and its hurting my mental health. I dont deal well with the kind of stress she's putting on me, and its affecting my grades and my motivation.\u00a0\n\nI want to move out, but I'm a full time student, so firstly I'd need to make time for a job. I cant afford to live in the dorms at my college, so I've been living at home.\n\nAnother problem is my pets. Even if I do find a job that fits my schedule and a studio/apartment I can afford that's not ridiculously far from my campus, I still have 4 birds which most places wont allow. I love them, they're my best friends, but living alone, working and going to school I wouldnt have the time to take care of them, not to mention the time to play with them and let them fly around all day like they're used to, as we dont let them out of the cage when they're home alone. I'm worried that if I left them at home, my mom might decide to give them away, maybe only keep the one that she likes. I know she is capable of taking care of them, and she would never cause them suffering to get back at me, but she's not attached to them the same way I am. I cant just leave them, but I cant take them with me, either.\n\nProbably the biggest problem is that there is a part of me that genuinely worries that, if I move out, my mom might actually kill herself. I genuinely dont know what to expect from her and it scares me. If I moved out and she did that I would 100% know it was my fault. She's progressively getting more and more unstable and I cant help her, but I would never want anything to happen to her. She's never even let me go on a sleep over, she's made me download a tracking app on my phone, she says she's sacrificed her whole life for me, which is true. She gave up everything to raise me as a mini-her, and she's trying to live vicariously through me and it hasnt worked the way she wanted. I'm my own person and she's lost because of it.\n\nTL;DR\nMy mother is manipulative, controlling, and emotionally abusive. I want to move out, to get some space but I dont know what to do about my birds, which are incredibly important to me. Part of me is worried she might even try to kill herself if I left and I dont know what to do. Everyone in my household is miserable and I just want to get out.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He never hit me or her so I haven't really thought about it as abuse.\n\nWhen I didn't focus on school or help him out it was because I was a lazy person.\n\nRecently he is a very angry and bitter person. 7 years ago before my parents divorced (he cheated on my mom yet claims to be the victim) I had a huge argument with him were I realised he does not listen to a word I'm saying. He doesn't respect me. So I was done with him but I have relation with him for these 7 years and I have been accepting way too much shit that I am used to it by now. What he does:\nComplain about me. Decisions, ideas, lifestyle, thoughts anything I think is \"wrong\" if it's not his way.\nIf I stand up for myself with a good explanation and logic he gets angry and ignores it. \n\n3 days ago we had a heated argument were I said how I do not appreciate him complaining about my life to me. It ended happy and I thought it would get better but no.\nYesterday he comes to spend time with me. \n\nI suggest we take up our boat from the harbour since he have complained about that since summer and its mostly \"my fault\" according to him because I never visit him. I visit him like 4 times a year and he never visits me except yesterday. Still \"I never visit him\".\n\nAnyway he says no to pulling up the boat because its rains little. So we go to my apartment and try to watch a movie. I'm interested in the movie he complains its too slow and no action. I turn it off and put on some stand up comedy, he just lays down on the couch and plays with his phone. \n\nHis partner calls him and tells him me and him can eat together because she is going to eat with her daughter. He says sure and ends the call then starts being pissed off because she wants to spend time with her daughter (20 years old and lives with her boyfriend).\n\n\nWe talk and he starts complaining about my decorating ideas, then I ask if we can eat and he says sure. He wastes 20 minutes thinking about what then decides its best he drives home but offers to buy me pizza. I accept and we drive to the pizzeria, he offers to pay for it and I decline and pay for it myself.

I love them both, and they both treat me and my brother well, but my dad is aggressive towards my mom. \n\nIt's apparently been going on for a long time, but my dad is cheating and he sometimes drinks, though not as much as he used to. Maybe a year and a half ago, during the summer, things got really bad. He was super angry and blamed my mom for everything. In the end, he got so agressive me and my mom and brother had to go stay with our cousins in another state. He broke a lot of stuff and, while drunk, threatened my mom that he would rape her if she wouldn't have sex with him. He cooled down and stopped drinking after we left, and when we came back we thought they would get divorced, but they made up and everything was back to normal for a while. \n\nRecently, my dad went to visit his mom and stopped taking his anger medication. He said he'd get back on it and I don't know if he has, but he's yelled at my mom a lot recently, leaving her crying. Just an hour ago, I head my mom tell my dad to get off her, after which he came downstairs and almost smashed her computer. Maybe 30 minutes ago, I heard her scream so I rushed over to the stairs. I motioned my brother to come down and gave him my phone. I told him to call 911 if I told him to and went up the stairs to see what happened. I put my ear to their door and heard liquid, then a few moments later the door started to open and my dad came out, by which time I'd bounded back so he wouldn't know I was listening. He told me my mom was fine and to go see her. She was in the shower.\n\nShe told me he'd just scared her and not hurt her so to not call the police, so I motioned my brother not to. My dad went downstairs before I talked to her and my mom got out and ready for work. I realized the liquid sound was my dad peeing in a cup she'd probably drink out of, so I told her not to and then she left. (She doesn't think our dad would hurt us, his anger has always been towards her)\n\nI don't think my dad has ever physically hurt my mom and he's never hurt me or my brother, though he has occasionally lashed out over the years and once he did threaten me after I made a sarcastic comment.

At one point I actually thought it might work out. For the first time in years of dating he even admitted to his narcissistic ways... he was in a vulnerable place not long after we broke up and I talked him through it. I don\u2019t know how it happened, but somehow we were talking almost every day for the most part. We hung out once as friends to go to a concert but other than that, communication has been just over the phone or through text. \n\nIt has been hard for both of us to not talk because we both needed each other a lot when we were dating. Breaking that routine was very challenging.

I said no initially but my afternoon opened up and we\u2019ve been communicating pretty decently so I thought why not? Big mistake. When I called him he was in a bad mood.

I immediately got upset and said I didn\u2019t understand why not 48 hours ago he let me cry on his shoulder then today he was being so cold. And it went from there.\n\nEverything I had said was shut down. The more he spoke the more emotional I got. The more I reacted the meaner he was. At one point I just started crying and he said I sounded pathetic like a baby. He literally chewed me up and spit me out like it was nothing. I asked why he was treating me this way. How when we first broke up we promised to work on ourselves and felt I had made such great strides and progress being a better version of myself and he told me \u201cI don\u2019t see any progress.

After I let that sink in my anxiety and depression skyrocketed and hasn\u2019t gone away since. \n\nThen the smear campaign came shortly after. He was telling mutual friends of ours that I was a crazy bitch and to not talk to me anymore. I tried reaching out to who I could that would answer but somehow at the end of the day I lost a few of our really good mutual friends as well that meant a lot to me.

I recently wrote what a day with him was like and I see why I struggle. For example:\n\n**Going To Bed:**\n\n* He controlled when we went to sleep. He said that couple should go to bed at the same time. - It was irrelevant that I am an \"early to bed, early to rise\" kind of person and he was a night owl\n* He would watch a movie on his iPad with the volume up, then fall asleep, leaving the movie playing until the end. I was not to wake him. - He got annoyed when I asked him to wear headphones and even more annoyed when I bought earplugs. Told me I was being dramatic.\n* He didn't like it if I was on my phone. He'd scowl at me and say something like \"Huh, always on that damn phone.\" Depending on his mood, he'd either pout about it, or interrogate me about what I was reading.\n* I had to face him when I slept. He didn't like when I'd turn away from him.\n* He kept the blinds open all night - we live in a city with lots of lights. I eventually bought a sleep mask, which of course annoyed him.\n* I would also be guilted/shamed into initiating sex with him. I knew what to do to make him finish quickly. I usually ended up secretly crying in the bathroom afterwards. It was one of the most dehumanizing aspects of our relationship.\n\n**Waking Up:**\n\n* He didn't like me to get up before him. Even to go to the bathroom.  He said he didn't like waking up alone - We could get out of bed when he was ready to get out of bed.\n* He didn't like waking up to me on my phone. - I could tell by his breathing/snoring when he was about to wake up so I could read to pass the time, then hide my phone under my pillow before he woke up.\n* He didn't like to wake up to me being wide awake. - \"God, I hate waking up to you just staring at me\" So, I pretended to be asleep.\n* If he woke up before me, he would get up, turn on CNN loudly and go about his morning as normal (We lived in a 1-bedroom apartment. The living room shared a wall with the bedroom)\n\nAt night I used to wake up in a panic trying to think of anything that might go wrong the next day that I should've been on top of. Particularly when it came to money. He loved to present himself as someone to be jealous of. He spent money like it was nothing. It was my job to find ways to maintain that lifestyle. If we had no money, it was my fault for not working enough, or not managing our businesses effectively. When I asked him to spend less, it always ended with me putting in more hours at our store and taking on an even heavier workload. It was always my fault.\n\nEven outside of money, I had to stay 3 steps ahead of life in general so I could anticipate what might set him off.\n\nI can't sleep.\n\nI take something to fall asleep every night. ( Just OTC medication, usually.) I stay asleep for a couple of hours, then wake up to my heart pounding out of my chest. I feel like I can't breathe. I try to calm my body and mind down. It seems like it's even more difficult to reason with your thoughts in the middle of the night. I usually stay awake for a couple of hours, then trick my body back to sleep. I've been gone a year and I still can't sleep. I JUST WANT TO GO TO SLEEP AND STAY ASLEEP. I've tried all the suggested stuff on the internet about insomnia, but I think the root of my problem is more CPTSD/PTSD based. I've come a long way this year, but this problem has persisted.

I offered to let him use my car (his car was getting a paint job in the shop) to run the errand while I am at my meeting and then he would just pick me up and we can get dinner together. So he said yes and he picked my car up from work and that was it. \n\nI let him know my meeting would be one hour long and that I would call him when I was ready to be picked up (he lives about 10 minutes away from my work). He says he will be there when I\u2019m out and just to focus on my meeting. \n\nSo my meeting ends and I call him and he said he will be there in about 10 minutes so I take my time packing my stuff up and head out to wait in the parking lot. About 20 minutes pass and I texted him where I was waiting (just in case he comes in from the opposite side) and he said okay he will be there soon. I wait.. and wait.. and wait. About 30 minutes pass and I\u2019m actually worried now, I call him and no answer. I send a text and ask if everything\u2019s okay and he responds that he will be there soon. By this time my office closed and it\u2019s dark and even the parking lot security guy left. I am waiting on the steps of my office by myself, my phone at 7%, and it\u2019s beginning to get a little sketchy in the area (2 men came up in a truck and asked if I wanted a ride, and a man on a bike asked me if I was waiting for someone). Now it\u2019s been 1 hour and 25 minutes since I first called him and I finally see him pull into the parking lot. \n\nI quietly get into the car and plug my phone in to charge it and he asks me what\u2019s wrong. I tell him I was tired from waiting and that I had a migraine and ask where he was (I\u2019m super non-confrontational so I asked him very politely and tried not to be dramatic about it). He tells me a long story about how he ran his errand and when he got back to his apartment he decided to take my car in to the mechanic next door to see what they can do about the tire sensor that is out (the sensor battery ran out but I have told him a few times I will be getting a new car soon so it\u2019s not really important for me to fix it right now) and that the mechanic took forever and that he had no choice but to wait for him to be done. At this time, my eyes automatically shift to the tire light that is on the dashboard, and I notice that about 1/3 of my tank is gone. This catches me off guard because I had just filled up my tank before work and I work locally so there\u2019s no way I could have used that much gas, even with him running his errand there\u2019s no way. But I of course tell myself to ignore it so I tell him \u201cthank you for thinking about that, but it wasn\u2019t necessary and I just wished he would\u2019ve been there because it was getting  dark and late and sketchy\u201d (I didn\u2019t share about the men that came up to me, I just honesty was so confused with his story and just happy to be safe in my car that I completely shut that part out). He says \u201csorry I won\u2019t do that again, I was just thinking about that car\u201d and I just stay quiet. A few minutes later he asks if I want dinner and I just tell him I want to go home, as I have a migraine. He tells me I\u2019m acting really cold with him and that he didn\u2019t know I was going to be this dramatic about it  and I\u2019m being moody and that he is sorry he was worried about the car and blah blah blah. I start to feel bad because I was acting quiet so I make small talk with him until he gets off at his apartment and I drive home. \n\nOn my way home all my emotions catch up to me and I of course cry to myself in my car and I try to reason with myself that it wasn\u2019t a big deal and that I shouldn\u2019t have been so cold with him. Later that night I texted him saying I was sorry and that I was just upset because I had a migraine. And that\u2019s it. We moved on and didn\u2019t talk about it again. \n\nNow that I am 5 days post breakup (for other reasons, though I think subconsciously having to do with this) I realize that he has many personality traits similar to a narcissist. And that the way I felt during the course of our 1.5 year relationship was very indicative of a toxic relationship with a narcissist. \n\nSo that\u2019s the incident. That\u2019s all that happened really. I have just never told anyone about it and I am beating myself up about not having been more straightforward with him about how I felt. I feel like besides the annoyance of having to wait 1.25 hours, my safety was compromised and things could have ended a whole lot differently. There\u2019s really nothing I could do now, the relationship is over and I really don\u2019t want to talk to him anymore, also, telling his this now would open up a whole other can of worms that I just can\u2019t deal with. \n\nFor anyone that has stayed to read this far along, thank you for listening. I feel slightly embarrassed that I let this (and a whole host of other things similar) happen to me, but I see everything so differently now.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My ex right before my nex and I dated for 4 years, but it was codependent in a way that I felt like I was his parent rather than partner and had to do so much for him. However, he was way sweeter and more sensitive to my needs than my nex ever was. \n\nMy nex, who I date for about 9 months on and off, on the other hand was super smart, had a lot of hobbies, and was pretty driven. However, he was not sensitive to me and was selfish, talked crap about my family, blamed me for all our issues.. basically the gamut of N traits. He made me feel so low about myself and all my family and friends say how I seemed like a different person with him. My mom said when I was with him I tried to make myself small and \u201cwhispery\u201d which is probably because I was always walking on eggshells and was trying to conform to what he wanted of me. \n\nI always feel like I have to stifle myself to be in relationships somehow. With my nex, I sometimes wouldn\u2019t correct hm on things or pretended not to know things when he asked, rather than come out and look like I was smarter than him or something because I know that would blow up in my face. \n\nI just want someone who I can be my whole self with, who challenges me intellectually and is not threatened by me by my success and intelligence. But who also is sensitive and kind. Like is that too much? Sometimes I think my standards are too high and I will never meet anyone like that. Can anyone relate?

My other friends also think that he has such a tendency.\n\nHere is a great example:I was in a mental institute for reasons. We played at the time World of Warcraft as a group. I was the unofficial leader of the group because I was the most knowledgable. I did read about everything related to the different classes and dungeons, I helped every member of the group to play better.\n\nThere was one guy that also showed quite much potential as a Raid leader. So I told him that he could be a Raid leader. That pissed my friend off and he started a quite unnecessary drama while I had far bigger problems in real life. He was angry about it, berated me. The whole thing was never about him. It would have changed nothing about his role in the group.\n\nWe ended the drama a few months later. But he never admitted that he was in the wrong and to end this shit, I just accepted that we were both to blame. Even thru I still, don't believe I didn't do anything wrong.\n\nYears later I did see in his flat a Simpson's bottle opener and pizza cutter that went missing from me during a time that this friend was often in my flat and he had at the time a tendency for stealing. I just want it back because it was a gift from my dad for me and my brother. I don't want or need an apology. I just want it back. Now he is claiming he got it from his sister, that he hasn't the beer opener, even thru I saw both in his new house.\n\nI confronted him today again, saying I just want it back. He went totally defensive and attacked me verbally.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*edit\\* I hope I posted it in the right place.

When I was 14(I\u2019m currently 20), I was texting this other gay kid at school a lot. Throughout our entire text conversation he was flirtatious and suggestive. At the time, I had no idea who or what I liked, but I was definitely questioning so I let it happen. \n\nA few days later my mom went through my phone and found the text messages. She absolutely freaked. There was a lot of yelling and screaming.  A few specific moment stuck out. \n\nThe day after, when we got home she grabbed me by my hair and started hitting me and saying \u201cyour step dad has a dick should I tell him to pull out his dick?\u201d over and over and over again. In the moment it seemed to last for hours. I still sometimes wake up crying from dreaming about it.\n \nTwo days after finding the texts, she picked me up from school and just immediately started screaming. She was punching the dashboard and the middle console yelling things like \u201cHow could you do this to me!?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve done so much for you and this is how you repay me!?\u201d \n\nHer anger eventually faded out and we just pretended nothing happened. During the remainder of high school she would often scold and make fun of me for my mannerisms being too feminine. She would get bitter about me having too many girl friends and always ask \u201cdo you like hanging out with girls because they talk about boys!?\u201d Sometime when watching tv or listening to music she would get mad and say \u201cboys don\u2019t listen to this kind of music\u201d or \u201cit isn\u2019t normal for boys to like this stuff\u201d \n\nAfter I left for college our relationship did a lot of healing. She got diagnosed and is taking medication for a personality disorder. She has become much more kind and understanding of my life in many aspects. Im very happy about it and I love her very much, but I still haven\u2019t told her that I identify as bisexual. \n\nEverything she\u2019s done has caused me to hold onto a lot of self-hatred and internalized homophobia. I have a boyfriend of one year, who I love very much, but my mother does not know he\u2019s my boyfriend. I feel like I am living a lie, I have trouble with PDA and sex because of the internalized homophobia, and my poor boyfriend probably feels like a dirty secret. \n\nIt\u2019s taken a lot of growing, but I\u2019ve finally somewhat come to terms with myself. In my growth I\u2019ve realized a few things that have prepared me to finally come out to her:\n\n1. What she did to me is 100% NOT OKAY and extremely wrong\n\n2. I feel a lot of pressure from my family (I\u2019m the baby and the second grandchild of 8 to attend college) to succeed and make them proud. I was always afraid if I came out I would disappoint them. Well...now I think...FUCK WHAT THEY THINK. It\u2019s my life to live fully and honestly. I will never be happy living for anyone else but my damn self. \n\n3. I am not wrong. I\u2019m not a sinner. I\u2019m not gross. I\u2019m not disgusting. I\u2019m not going to hell. I\u2019m not a disappointment. And most importantly I did NOT deserve the abuse. \n\nThank you for reading...I just wanted to share my journey with the emotional and physical abuse my mother put me through in relation to my sexuality. I hope some of you can relate or take a lesson away from it. Always remember that whatever you have endured...it was NOT your fault and you will overcome it.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I had him telling me over the phone more than 10 times in three months that he wished me to find a better man and goodbye, and he knew that I would get panicked as I don\u2019t want him to kill himself. \n\nA week and a half ago, I finally had the courage to tell him that we are over. I told him I don\u2019t want to be with him anymore. He got angry, told me that whoever I choose to be with over him is just using me. He also told me that he had bought a ring and has a date planned to ask me to marry him (he is 40 and I am 21. I am a student living alone, he is semi retired living with mum and dad). He said his grandparents will give him 500k if he marries someone before they die. He said we made a good couple.

When I was at the age of 6, I was sexually abused on two separate occasions, by my mom's teenage brother. Then, when I was somewhere between 9-10 years old, I was groped by a neighbor. \n\nI don't think I fully registered that what I experienced was sexual abuse until I was in my early teens. But even then, I couldn't understand exactly what I had gone through, so I didn't think much of it and didn't feel much towards it. It wasn't until I got to college that the thoughts of what happened began to plague my mind. I felt disgusted. I felt betrayed. I grieved my loss of innocence.\n\nI lost my virginity when I was 20 years old. It was in the backseat of a car with a guy who was 8 years older than me, and although he was nice and kind and I trusted him, a part of me was disappointed. Mostly because I romanticized too much of how my first time would be like. After that night, I went home and crawled into bed and cried myself to sleep. I felt so guilty. My therapist says that unfortunately, my feelings of guilt towards sex are directly linked to each other because of what I experienced as a child. I am afraid that this feeling will never go away.\n\nRecently, I started talking to an Asian guy who shares the same ethnic background I do. Usually sexting and phone sex doesn't trigger me. But sexting with him triggered me. Again, after everything, I hugged myself and cried myself to sleep because of how guilty I felt. To be quite honest, this was a moment of epiphany for me. All my life, I found myself unattracted to Asian men. Perhaps the reasoning for this is because my uncle and neighbor were both Asian men.\n\nAnd then, the promiscuity. Before I dive into this, I have only slept with one guy and that was described above already. However, I will admit that I do a lot of posting online of half-naked photos of myself for male attention. This started in my freshman year of college. The attention feeds me. It's almost like an addiction. I've even gone as far as playing with myself on a live stream. But on the other end of this, there are times where I block all of my social media apps and delete all of my photos because attention from men is the last thing I want. During these times, I think that men are disgusting and I can't stand to socialize with one.\n\nMost days, I feel okay. In fact, sometimes I don't even think about it. But on days where the memories loom my head, are days where I feel like I've been hit with a ton of bricks, spiral out of control, and just want to kill myself. I was only  six when my innocence was taken away from me. Six years into life, and my life had already been tainted. No, I don't feel like some miracle child who overcame adversity by graduating at the top of her high school class and is due to graduate from college. I feel like a sad, broken soul, a victim on sexual abuse. A victim who will have to live with the repercussions of something that was completely out of her control, something that she couldn't even say \"no\" to. I am hurt, I am damaged.

I've been married for 20 years. Our daughter is 10. She is the reason I've not left him yet.\n\nFor long stretches in our relationship I was very delusional. But a couple of times I have almost left him. The thing is, his abuse was always worst when I felt the most trapped in the marriage. When I had a bad injury and had to use crutches for almost a year. When I was pregnant and had no income. When our daughter was a baby. I almost left him then nevertheless. But he always seemed to sense when there was a real danger of me leaving and his behaviour improved. \n\nI hate to say that for a very long time I had still feelings for him. But this is completely gone now. He is in his 60s now and his general behaviour has become totally annoying. He \"learns\"  10+ languages with some android apps and spends hours on the phone. He brags to everybody about this and traps people in long and boring conversations about this, about his intellect, about his other hobbies, about boring stuff that he read on the internet and that he finds bad or outrageous or used to be better in his day. I am just enduring this stoically with minimal engagement, trying to do more fun stuff on my own. Thankfully he is out of town 3 days during the week.\n\nLast year Christmas we had a huge argument because he got lazier and lazier, up to the point where he literally did nothing at all anymore around the house. I told him I cannot go on like this because while I've gotten quite used to doing everything on my own (and outsourcing much of the chores), I hate how he always reacts so mean in the rare cases I do ask him for something. Of course this resulted in him shouting, but somehow he seemed to realise that I'm really done with his shit.\n\nSince then, he really makes an effort to be helpful around the house, does chores on his own without pointing every little thing he does out to me and expecting praise for it.\n\nOf course this is too little too late. I have lost all respect for him and don't really like him anymore. I can't think of anything that's more fun with him than without him. Of course living with him is a lot easier now that I don't care about him at all anymore and he cannot really hurt me with anything he says anymore.\n\nLately I just find myself thinking more and more about how I can get out. The sad thing is he doesn't seem to notice I don't want anything to do with him anymore. He seems to think I still care about our marriage when the only thing I care about is raising our daughter with as little damage as possible.\n\nI know separation would be a huge drama and outright war. Our daughter just started a more demanding school. I don't want to subject her to a war between her parents now. Plus, I mentioned a possible separation twice to her when things were really bad with the narc and she started to cry harder than I've ever seen her cry. It broke my heart and I decided to stay for the time being.\n\nSometimes though I think maybe the damage will be worse when I stay? We're not exactly good role models for a healthy marriage. I'm done covering up for him though and don't want her to think his behaviour is normal. Sometimes I point out that his behaviour is childlike and what a normal reaction should look like. Of course this leads to her also losing respect for him.\n\nI know he loves her more than anything and generally he treats her quite well. He takes her to sports activities and to horse riding holidays (I'm scared of horses). So I really think for the time being it is better to ride it out and provide her with a stable home. Maybe that changes when she's grown up more and he starts to treat her worse.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He did though, pretty soon, start to project insecurities onto me (in the form of yelling at me and insulting me) that he didn't think I found him attractive. It was around time he also started using the word \"lesbian\" towards me, which I told him I wasn't comfortable being called, like I said, I'm bisexual and I know he was using the word in a way to hurt me. \n\nThis progressed to him telling me that I should try to masturbate to pictures of penises. I told him I wasn't comfortable with him asking me to do that. He continued to press on. After a while of his requests I decided to give it a go. I think like most people I don't find dicks attractive. They look like elongated mushrooms. No offence guys. But I just couldn't get off on pictures of dicks. I told him this in a sort of jokey way, and I got fucking yelled at. \n\nThis was the worst of it. One day, not long before we broke up, we were home alone together and... did the do. Well almost. As we were getting into things, he got his penis out and made me touch it while telling me; \"this will turn you straight. This will fix you.\" He made me masturbate while I was doing this. \n\nThe next day he tried to do the same thing. I refused. He yelled at me again. \n\nHe told me I was a faggot, that I was undeserving of his love, that I didn't love him... Whatever he could come up with really. Again, I, for some reason, shrugged this off after he apologised. I told myself he was just having a bad day. \n\nI don't know why, but after that he stopped. I guess it's lucky he didn't try other \"methods\".", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Could it be the Drugs?", "author": "TheRealInZannity", "self_text": "So my wife and I have been married for 4 almost 5 years and recently this have turned for the worse. She recently had a restraining order placed on me after her \u201cfriends\u201d pushed hard for it. We both have used drugs off and one and it\u2019s been an extremely chaotic ride. She was diagnosed with Histrionic Personality Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, then she started seeing a psychiatrist who diagnosed her with Bipolar Disorder. Her one friend was absolutely certain she didn\u2019t have bipolar disorder unless she experienced we extreme mood swings and got laid into for something that would be a minor issue. That same friend decided to diagnosed me with Narcissistic Personality Disorder all while providing her with syringes and meth to shoot up. I myself have a problem with meth and heroin and had been clean off heroin for years with MAT. The time that we were sober things were for the most part amazing. We were perfect for each other. Then we would start using and I will be the first to admit I become an angry even evil person when I use meth. So as I read these posts I see so much of myself and her in them but they are only during the times when we are using. She would constantly accuse me of cheating and I would become angry and verbally/mentally abusive. I would call her names and she would respond with the same or go cry for hours in the bed room. She would cry louder and louder as if trying to get me to comfort her and I regretfully wouldn\u2019t because I would hold on to my anger and feel she should just get over it. I now regret that decision, clarity comes with sobriety. She would also sexualize everything and I\u2019d we didn\u2019t have sex at least 1-2 times a day she would tell me that I didn\u2019t find her attractive and that is the furthest from the truth. Methadone makes a persons sex drive almost non existent and I had been tapering to get off and my sex drive was coming back but by this time we had become so resentful to each other we would avoid each other. I ended up watching porn and then was told I was cheating by doing so. I feel like I have so much to say and can\u2019t really organize my thoughts or order or events so sorry for the disorientation.  My main point is that I love her and right now I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019ve been discarded but as people on here call it going no contact with their NEX. I also suffered a TBI at the hands of someone she is indirectly responsible for having in our home. People keep telling me she had me assaulted but I could never believe it. Right now I\u2019m essentially homeless if not for the Veterans Affairs, I\u2019ve lost my job she placed all our vehicles, home and even our cats on a restraining order. When I was forced to leave by the police I left without a jacket and asked if I could get one. She said yes and put it outside and then her two druggie friends and her called the cops when I grabbed it off the lawn and I went to jail for violations a protective order. She would hit me and throw things and threaten to kill me and tell me that it wasn\u2019t abuse because she\u2019s 90lbs and it\u2019s not possible for her to actually hurt me. On several occasions hate admitting this but I put my hands around her neck and we fell to the ground. It makes me sick to thing about it, not to excuse the behavior but she brought up some very traumatic sexual trauma that I had told no except her about and it hurt and made me so angry and she wouldn\u2019t stop with the verbal assault. This all only happened while using meth. I\u2019m going to stop here because I\u2019m tired and getting emotional. I miss her so much and only want the person I married back when we both were sober. We have a son together and another son that\u2019s mine and hers from a previous relationship that I have guardianship to when I was in the hospital in intensive care while she was having an affair with a man in Texas. It hurts the more type. I just think that it\u2019s the drugs and we both have issue that we handle when sober. I don\u2019t know what to do I\u2019ve already messed and dread going to court to hear her use my attempts at contact to have me arrested . I\u2019m scared and hurt and the police wouldn\u2019t even issue the restraining order because there had been no physical abuse during those times. So she went and filed one herself. I don\u2019t want a divorce I want sobriety and my wife back. Divorce has yet to be filed as far as I\u2019m aware of. I\u2019m hurting and lost and feel like it\u2019s all my fault.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

His parents attended. Usually, when his parents come to these events I know ahead of time and prepare a meal for them. This time, they didn\u2019t let me know.\nAfter the event they talked about how they were not expecting me to invite them, but would accept if I did invite them. They said they were hoping, but not expecting. I said I was just going to make a simple meal for my family, and they said: \u201cwe love that!\u201d And stayed.\nI cooked a nice meal while they were in my kitchen, and when my husband arrived, he wasn\u2019t happy. He didn\u2019t offer to help or anything and was quiet most of the dinner. After they left, I was expecting a \u201cthank you\u201d from my husband, but instead, he was angry asking me how HiS parents ended up at our house. I explained I didn\u2019t invite them, but accommodated by cooking for them. He then proceeded to say how tired he was and it was hard for him to entertain his parents.  I was confused and hurt. I tried telling him I was the one who ended up doing the work for his parents. I also went to his social event, when I didn\u2019t have to. He shut down and accused me of accusing him and how it was impossible to talk to me. He didn\u2019t talk to me for the whole day and it wasn\u2019t until the evening that he came to talk to me.\nHis apology was\u201d I am sorry it looked like I was blaming you.\u201d Then he proceeded to tell me he was going though a hard time and really wanted me to see his side. Never once did he ask about me or how hurt I was. When I did manage to say I was hurt and upset, he would say: \u201ci am sorry. I feel bad\u201d.  Everything felt really one sided.\nThe next day I wrote an email explaining how I felt and how I didn\u2019t feel heard when he apologized. He came to talk to me and expressed his apologies. I could see he felt really bad. I could see he was remorseful, but he wouldn\u2019t say anything and just stare at the floor. He then said whenever he is silent is because he has his own feelings to deal with and he doesn\u2019t know how to put them aside to consider mine.\n\nBackground information:\n\nWe have been married for 18 years.\nHis parents and him have a good relationship, but his parents make a lot of racist comments when they come and visit. (Both my husband and I do not like that, especially because I am not white).\nHe has never indicated or said anything to me about not having his parents over. In fact, he has asked me may times to host them.\nWe are currently \u201cseparated\u201d while living together to sort out our relationship. ( I have just begun to realize we have very unbalanced and unhealthy patterns).\nWe are both going through therapy: individual and couple therapy.\n\nWhat I am wondering;\nI am trying to figure out if he is abusive, and a narcissist, and will never be able to consider my feelings, or if he just needs help and needs to learn how to consider my feelings.\nCan people who show abusive/narcissistic behaviors ever change? \n\nI guess my question for myself, as a write this is: do I want to stick around until he learns how to consider my feelings? \n\nTLDR:\nMy husband was mad at me because he thought I had invited his parents over for dinner, when in fact they invited themselves over. \nHe admitted to not being able to consider my feelings when he has his own feelings to deal with.\nDo I want to stick around and hope he learns how to consider my feelings too?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

About a year ago I left the girl who I thought was the one for me. Long story short, I had a couple of mental breakdowns and a burnout for not listening to my gut right from the start. It took me a whole year to make it to this point, low contact has been going on for a few months now.\n\nI can't even describe how important this subreddit has been for me during these times. It was here where I realized that I was not crazy, that she has a mask, that she does nice things to get her way in the end, that she concealed truths and lied right to my face. She even manipulated me into thinking bad things about my close friends. With this subreddit I realized her patterns and learned about covert narcissism. I truly had never met anyone like her before, never a covert one so that was my biggest downfall.\n\nJust a few moments ago I was lying on my bed like any other day recently, having my mind and chest grinding with confusion and different emotions. Then I \"saw\" it. The following paragraph is my mental image of what I felt, so bear with me. \n\nI saw my anxiety in my chest, bubbling, swirling, burning and boiling. Somehow I concealed it into a purple bubble and started to calm it down by caressing it with white feathers and breathing. Inside that bubble was me, as a kid, maybe 7 years old. Kid-me was shouting the words \"We need you! We need YOU back!\" at me. During this I felt this cool calm wash over me, like I was concealed into another bigger bubble. I was safe. I was cocooned.\n\nNow, I feel peace. Earlier today I was playing with the thought of ending my life because she just didn't go away from my head. Everywhere I looked, everything I did reminded me of her and how we used to be in situations that involved those things I saw or did. Now.. The bubble in my chest calms all that anxiety. It's a part of me now. There are small ripples of thoughts that would normally give me anxiety, but they seem so small now, and they diminish inside this bubble. I don't know how, but I feel peace, zen-like. I'm me again. Everything she put me through, every word and every thought she implanted into me is dying out as I write this. I feel sorry for her. I know how she became like this, I know why she keeps on being like this, and I wish she could win her battle against her demons one day. I feel so bad for her that I want to cry, but I can't save her, I can't change her. I tried. I tried so hard to make it work between us, but it was too much. I just broke myself for a dream that was too good to be true right from the start. My view has changed dramatically, I am not the same person anymore. Every problem and every person I can think of does not give me anxiety anymore. I look and feel everything through that bubble now, and it feels like it just takes all the punches and sharp edges off of things that normally would derail me. Tomorrow I will see if I can keep this going, but it feels like I had a new armor or a filter for incoming crap bombs the world will surely throw at me in the future, or stuff my mind tries to throw at me from my past life. Everything feels like a past life now. Even the person who I was before. \n\nThank you all. Thank you for sharing your experiences. Keep sharing. Keep no contact. And please, please take care of yourselves. Make your self and your healing a priority number one. Give yourself time. Don't do stuff if you feel powerless, don't force yourself. Connect with old friends, watch old pictures and remind yourself where you come from. You. Will. Get. Better. And. You. Will. See. Everything. Differently. EVERYTHING.\n\nIt feels good to be back, although I am not the same person who disappeared. I feel like no one can harm me ever again. Peace. \n\n\"Before you see the light you must die.\"", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Our relationship is officially over. I am dealing with some really difficult emotions.\n\nTo be honest, I saw it coming. Over the past few weeks, his love-bombing slowed down, and he started to neglect to uphold his charming faux front. I could feel him fading and growing ever-colder, and started to sporadically treat me with real meanness and cruelty. He became the only thing that mattered \u2013 and I guess that\u2019s what narcissists are all about. He was always innocent, I was always an annoyance. He was always in the right, and I was always wrong. He was not treating with love or with respect. \n\nMonths ago, I realized that there was something not right with him; something about him was abnormal. Then I found this sub. I did some researching and occurred to me that he possessed an abundance of narcissistic-sociopathic traits: a huge ego, a constant need for validation, a tendency to lie, superficial charm and love-bombing, alcoholism, no life plan or goals, and most likely a high proficiency in manipulation. He absolutely used intermittent reinforcement on me \u2013 he would alternate between love-bombing and treating me horribly \u2013 and I hate that I fell for it. He overtly hated women and made misogynistic statements all the time. I am so, so, so angry with myself for ignoring the myriad of red flags.\n\nI am super angry that he managed to break up with/discard me before I found the guts to dump him. I saw it coming because he tested me in a horrendously cruel manner (to see how I would react to the discard) ahead of time. I am always too nice and too lenient! I don\u2019t know how to forgive myself. It feels as if by giving him the chance to discard me first, I allowed his ego another massive power trip. Even when I told him that I was happy about the breakup, he had to rub in the fact that he was the one to do it, and accused me of acting like a \u201cgeneric bitch\u201d just because I \u201cdidn\u2019t get what I want.\u201d That angers me because it looks to be him stoking his own ego. He wanted to think that he\u2019d hurt me when I was really just defending myself. \n\nAnd I did my best to defend myself. The way he broke up with me was quite evil. He started it by sending me a detailed description of his \u201cideal woman\u201d in which he described a hypothetical woman that was my exact opposite. Then he said, \u201cI believe, and I really do not feel sorry about this, that you are cancelled.\u201d It was so callous and immature, considering that I was so kind and tolerant with him and his shit \u2013 too kind and too tolerant. I spent hours of my time with him, only to be treated like shit by him later. He thinks that he was a good boyfriend for doing the bare minimum, while I completely surrendered my inner experience to him. He even verbally attacked me on the day I learned that my close friend had passed away, a time where I was extremely emotionally vulnerable. \n\nDuring the breakup, he claimed that he was ending our relationship because it was doomed from the start, because he had little shared interests (though his only interests are playing video games, getting drunk, partying, and failing his classes), and because I am, in his words, \u201cnot white\u201d (I am Italian). I resent the fact that he directed his racism at me: you have to be a serious racist to classify Italians as not white. Also, his reasons sound like a load of bull to me. I told him that I deserved better than his terrible treatment, and he said and I quote, \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve shit.\u201d He also said, \u201cMy love for you was built on stories I told myself.\u201d I think that he tried to play it off like it was never real and \u201cmade up\u201d in his head so that he could appear innocent and avoid any responsibility for essentially using me the entire time.\n\nHe told me that my ex was only with me because of he was desperate, which is really mean. He also called me the following names after the discard: retard (2x), crazy (2x), and hippie (which makes no sense, but I like flannels and indie music). I cannot believe that somebody like him would have the audacity to call me crazy or retarded. Then again, he seriously thinks that he is a genius. He said and I quote: \u201cI am probably the smartest kid in the entire university.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m feeling so much regret and frustration. I feel like a huge idiot for staying, and I\u2019m grieving for all the time I wasted on him. I hate that I let him play me, right to the end. All of this is super hard, and I feel super weak and used. This relationship has taken a pretty awful toll on my self-esteem. \n\nHe had the audacity to send me a message hours later that said \u201cit\u2019d be dumb for us to hate each other now.\u201d I have not opened it. I\u2019m very tempted to send him an assertive message of closure, but since I can\u2019t count on him to regard my feelings, I\u2019m not sure if I should. \n\nIn all of this I did have just one victory.\n\nI never told him that I loved him. I never said I love you too. Not once. I think it was because I knew.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I've got this plan in my mind for ending things, and I'm working through the problems I have in order to get to where I can break things off. But we're in the honeymoon part of the cycle right now, and some moments I have to remind myself that this is an abusive relationship. Maybe a post or two here semi-regularly will keep me accountable, to myself if to no-one else.\n\nSince I first came here, I've done a bit to prepare for leaving:\n\n1. I've gotten all my important papers out of my filing cabinet and hidden in a place where she would never find them.\n2. I've (quietly) gotten most of my stuff out of her garage. This was easier than expected. Some things need to go to the dump still, and I've got a plan in place for having a friend \"buy\" them from me and put them into storage for me. The things remaining are the things I use there on a regular basis (side business doing some woodworking). My goal is to get everything out that can't fit into one trip with a pickup truck.\n3. I'm on the waiting list at my apartment complex for a garage. This is a better option that a mini storage place because the garages have electricity, which would allow me to continue my woodworking business after it leaves her garage. I can get a mini storage location quickly, though, so if I need to do that in a rush, I still have that option. A garage would also let me be home without her seeing my truck here and knowing that I'm home.\n4. I put the money into my truck to fix it so it's reliable. We do 98%+ of our driving around town in her car, so my truck not being very reliable hasn't been a problem. Today I spent the money ($550, ouch) to get things fixed so it's good and reliable for me so I won't have transportation issues post-breakup.\n5. I've started making a list (where she can't get to it) of the things she says/does that are emotionally abusive. \n6. I've started trying to go \"grey rock\" on her, and while it works sometimes, it's super hard to remain that way, especially when it's a good day, re: her mood and actions. It's also hard to bite my tongue and not give her the response I know she wants.\n\nSome struggles I'm having:\n\n1. Reminding myself that this is a bad relationship, even when it feels good here in the honeymoon phase of the cycle.\n2. Working up the nerve to confide in my friend that I'm in an abusive relationship. I don't expect rejection or ridicule, but there's a male pride issue here I'm really wrestling with.\n3. Finding a reason I can start seeing a therapist so that it's not obvious why I really need to talk to someone regularly.\n4. Picking a date for ending things. I can't do it yet, but I'm hoping to do it soon. The question is how soon. There are 2 things I have to figure out before I can end it:\n   1. Get my friend to help (#2 above). I guess I just need to get over the fear and just find an excuse to get to him and tell him what's up.\n   2. Plan the day-of timeline so that while I'm doing the breakup, my apartment door locks get changed, my dog (that she bought me for Christmas 2 years ago) is where she can't try to take her back, and the stuff that remains at her garage can get moved into storage before she has a chance to respond to the breakup. I'm hopeful that I can get everything planned so that when it's over, I don't need to go to her house for anything and so that she doesn't need to come back here for anything. That'll help in trying to go no-contact after it's over.\n5. When (and what) to tell my kids. Do I tell them before it goes down or after? My son has some stuff in her house that he'll need to get out before the breakup happens, but I could probably get her ex-husband to tell their son to pull that stuff aside. It'll be hard to find an excuse for him to need that stuff, since it's all fishing gear and we don't fish during the winter months. Worst case, it's just stuff that can be replaced, but my son will really be upset about losing his fishing stuff, even if I buy him new stuff to replace it. So I'm trying to avoid that.\n6. My son will be losing a really good friend in this. He and my gf's son are really close, and when this is over, he'll need to not go around her, so he won't be able to see his friend. I'm not sure how to prep him for the breakup or how to handle the situation after the breakup.\n\nI think that's about it for now. Any thoughts/advice/input on any of this would be appreciated, but if nothing else, I appreciate this being a place I can go where I'm not alone.

The only reason this question came up was because multiple friends have said something to me about it, I just want to know if my relationship with my mom is normal. \n     I\u2019ve never not felt like a burden around my mom. Even when I was much younger, I would always hide a part of myself around her. I\u2019ve never told her anything about my life without her asking out of slight fear of being judged. To give a specific example of this happening, I tried to come out to my parents when I was fourteen. They immediately began picking on me relentlessly with anything they could think of. It was easier for me to just pretend to get a boyfriend to prove there was nothing to worry about.  When I asked my mom to stop, she would reply with something along the lines of , \u201coh, I forgot you\u2019re fourteen and over sensitive\u201d. I thought I was until a few months ago. \n     My parents also seem to pit my sister and I again send each other, I really like playing classical music and am in the orchestra, the choir, and the marching band. My parents never seem incredibly thrilled when I show them something having to do with music, but when my sister does a backflip (she\u2019s a gymnast) they rant and rave about how she\u2019s going to go to the olympics one day. Maybe she is better at gymnastics than I am at music, but I still feel like crap because of it. \n     The noticeable ones are what I thought was normal. My mom tends to be a bit of a loose cannon. To a point that my sister and I have planned protocol for every emotion she has. If we come home and she\u2019s happy, all is well. If she\u2019s irritable, we go to our rooms and only talk over text. So on and so on. We\u2019re not afraid that she\u2019s going to hurt us. We\u2019re afraid she\u2019s going to find something we haven\u2019t done and yell at us about it. \n     The punishment system in my house is sort of weird I\u2019ve been told. We don\u2019t normally get grounded, we normally get the silent treatment. Every once in a while, my sister and I won\u2019t do chores, or our grades will get low or something else will happen and mom will announce she\u2019s, \u201cgoing on strike\u201d. Basically, we have to figure out rides for ourself for places other than school, we have to shop for groceries we want with our money and we overall just become completely self sufficient. \n     And the last thing which I\u2019ve been told is why makes it \u201cabusive,\u201d is that my mom will pick and choose instances in the past and insist that they went differently. I bought my laptop when I was twelve with my own money, but she insists that though the computer I have now was bought with my own money, she bought me one before that. I\u2019d believe her but I can\u2019t remember a single thing that would lead to the conclusion I had a laptop before I was twelve. I was really good at horseback riding when I was seven and was told by my instructors that I could compete, after begging to compete, my parents said no and then years later told a bunch of people that they wanted me to compete soooo so bad but I refused, and quit because of it.

In the 4 years he had told me he loved me then didn\u2019t love me about 1000x over. He\u2019d shout at me, and put me down, grab my belly and tell me how big it was getting. While I slept, he\u2019d wake me up by hitting, shoving, and kicking me, all because I was snoring or \u201cbreathing to heavily\u201d. In the last year of being with him, I became really good friends with a new guy in work, and he asked me to stop talking to him. At first I did, but this guy was such a good friend, and he understood, and would listen to me when I needed to talk. I told me ex I wasn\u2019t going to stop, and although he wasn\u2019t happy, that was the end of it, or so I though. Me and the guy from work would talk all day every day, the best friend I could possibly have (same birthday and everything). I started to feel bad because I was getting feelings for this guy, so I told him it wasn\u2019t fair on my boyfriend(now ex) how much we were talking, and we should cut it down. \nA couple of days later, I woke u too find my ex on my phone, but with his phone case around it. He was angry. The messages he read were me telling the guy from work we shouldn\u2019t talk so much, thank god that it wasn\u2019t ones of me complaining. \nHe made me message the guy from work, tell him we couldn\u2019t be friends, and  told me to block him off everything, which I did. My heart was breaking because this guy was the only one who knew in depth how bad it really was and, I liked him.  My ex went on holiday 3 dats later for 2 weeks. I had a call at 5am one morning. He was drunk. He told me he cheated on me, I cried because I was hurt. He then turned around and told me he lied, and wanted me to feel the hurt he did. I was so confused. I had never cheated on him, all I had done was talk to a friend. \nFast forward to my work Christmas party, I got jealous because I saw one of the girls talking to him, and found him on Twitter, and messaged him telling him how sorry I was, and that I liked him and I was going to break up with my boyfriend. \nWe talked on Twitter from December up until may, the whole time, I was still with my ex. Me and the guy from work would flirt so much, and on our birthday, he bought me a yellow watch as a present and gave it to me in work, and in the spur of the moment, I kissed him. \nFor the following months we\u2019d hide in work and kiss. It killed me that this was who I was becoming, but the man who I thought I loved was slowly killing any and all of the self love and confidence I had, where as the guy in work, was showing me how love should feel. \nMe and my ex had a holiday planned for may, and I swore to myself, once that holiday was over, I had to end it. I told my friends I was going to do it, but no one believed me, and who could blame them? I\u2019d already broken up with him 6 times since November.\nI messaged the guy from work, and asked if we could hang out after work before I went on holiday. At first he didn\u2019t want to, and I totally got why, I had a boyfriend, what we were doing was wrong, I felt that too. He did agree however to hang out on the Monday before I left, at his house. I told myself nothing would happen, but it did. \nIt killed me, that that was who I had become. A cheater. But you know what? That\u2019s what ultimately helped me end it with him.\nI went on the holiday, we went with a bunch of his friends. I was miserable the whole time, he threw me so hard down a zip line that it caused a bruise on my but crack that looked like a pen had broken and there was ink everywhere. On the Saturday after we got home, we argued and I ended it.\nMe and the guy from work are together, and have been since 2 weeks after I broke up with my ex, and I\u2019m not even sorry.\nI\u2019m sorry I cheated, yes, because that is never who I wanted to become. I\u2019ve probably shot myself in the foot now too because I\u2019m terrified that the guy from work is going to cheat on me, or is texting other girls behind my back and deleting it. But that\u2019s my own doing, and he always reassured me that I\u2019m all he\u2019s ever wanted, that I\u2019m his everything. The difference is, he reminds me every day how loved I am, and never makes me feel small.\nYes, I get bad days, but that\u2019s because after we broke up my ex turned up at my bedroom window(I\u2019m on the second floor) and when he was drunk he called me for a lift home and foolishly I did, which resulted in him ripping the handle off the inside of my car door (I wish I was over exaggerating). I find it very difficult to sleep in my room alone now, because I\u2019m terrified he will come back. \nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m expecting from writing all this down or if it helps anyone at all, but damn it feels good to let out the stress and truth of the past year. \nI know Ive got a long way to go yet before I get back on the right path, but I\u2019m slowly getting there and undoing the damage he caused, one step at a time.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

{"post_id": "dvnlxc", "created_utc": 1573626323, "title": "Is this a narcissist?", "author": "CryptanalyticBob", "self_text": "Advice for a damaged soul who fell for a manipulator\n\nI (M35) I met this woman (F26) 18 months ago let's call her K. I was separated from my now x wife after years of a dead bedroom relationship. My confidence was shot and I had a lot of self doubt. To be honest I have not fully recovered. \n\nIn the beginning we had a lot in common,we clicked and as I was lonely within a couple of weeks we hanged out daily. I found myself attracted to her,she is hot as in men notice her, but also funny smart charming etc. Note that many guys were into her hitting on her even.at work etc. trying to go out with her,she had exes pursuing her etc. And she kept into contact with many of them etc. She sort of plays the cute damsel in distress. \n\nSlowly I started falling for her and didn't notice that she had no boundaries so to speak. It was too much contact too soon and she was intoxicating to me after the years of neglect. \n\nWe were doing everything together watching movies at home going out and I didn't notice that it was more or less about what she wanted needed from me. At some point we started caressing each other kissing each other's hands while watching movies etc. She also talked to me very openly about her sexual preferences. \n\nI let her know a couple of times how I felt. She was getting out of a relationship,(its complicated situation, she saying it was over but having constant contact) afraid of my ongoing divorce and didn't want anything more than friendship. I helped her move houses and continued helping her with anything she wanted. One night she was hurt by the actions of a family member and it was the first time I saw her really cry and supported her. \n\nDuring a work trip she told kept that she made out with a friend of mine and that she really liked him which made me go insane.\n\nA couple of months later she sort told me to give it a shot together after I helped her with an injury and stayed a couple of days with her. We were hugging in bed and at some point as my hand ventured ever so slightly she jumped back and pulled back. I apologised and then she explained she was previously in abusive relationship.\n\nI throttled back, saw her less and noticed she was hanging with a new guy. She was adamant nothing was happening. In the meantime I met someone interesting but kept it friendly. In the meantime K was sending me photos of her nails, her dresses in changing room (sexy but not dirty). It's like she replaced me with him. \n\nIn the end this new guy of hers was led on by her and he had to cut off completely (later she admitted to lying and deceipt). Some months later she was into another guy which she happenedto stay with in another city for a couple of nights. It was then I realised that she gets into these sort of situations. I sort of understood I helped her in work assignments, she visited me to do laundry at my house and many times we met there was something in it for her. And many times she praised other men to me and never really told me anything positive. I could count what she did for me on a hand and remembered that at some point she even told me that if she was me she wouldn't be talking to her. Also she doesn't take criticism well, it's always deflected. Additionally she never remembered or asked really about my important stuff whereas I always was concerned and ask about hers. It's like I am a resource to her. \n\nAt that point she coincidentally chained jobs bu I took the opportunity and in one of our outtings I leveled with her told her again my feelings and slowly detached because during the conversation she told me she wants to meet her future husband and I meet some of her requirements and perhaps I am the one but she doesn't trust me and also that she doesn't believe in true friendship and everyone has something to gain. It dawned on me she has no empathy. We kept some contact but not like before. I was amazed that now she got a new job she had new \"friends\" to help her however she stopped going out with the old gang, hanged out with coworkers and whenever she met me wanted it to be one on one. I was also less taught after for help. \n\nIn the meantime I started dating the person I mentioned earlier but didn't really advertise it. She is open dynamic sensitive and empathetic. K started to want to see me and reached out to me and when we met sat on my lap, proposed to go on a vacation together and even wanted me to help her buy a bikini but insisted it was friendly. I declined and explained to her that this is not how I operate. \n\nA couple of months later I told her I am dating someone and her response was I want to know who she is so that I can tell if I am better than her. I was shocked. Time went by she sometimes calls me when she needs something trivial like directions or other stuff and I always answer. Seeing her always does something to me. It's like when I am with her I forget the past and her behaviour. \n\nSo why am I here. Since I am in a situation with this new person, am happy and have developed feelings, inexplicably I find myself thinking about K. Things reached boiling point a month ago when we went out and I leveled with her about this feeling I get sometimes about her and the response I got was that she is not in it right now as she is buried in work and career but never say never. And that she was in love with me and even asked for advice from a couple of the guys,like the one mentioned above about me. She received negative feedback for me from some of my \"friends\" and also I had distanced myself she said and was sometimes talking about my divorce which she didn't like. Basically it seems it was my fault for not getting this.and for us nor being together even though she knew multiple times how I felt and it was really evident I would be with her in.a heartbeat. But from everything else she said I didn't pick up feelings or empathy but more like suitability / checklist. And that now circumstances have changed and all is gone. She says this casually and continues conversation like should we meet 2-3 days later and talk etc. Cold. \n\nEven now I am willing to break plans to see her even if it's rare. I feel ashamed as I still sometimes want to be with her even though I get she is wrong for me/has issues whatever. I dunno if this is me thinking with my lower head or she is the one that got away. I have always been drawn to challenging situations and women in need. And i don't see that sometimes these women won't end up being good partners. I would be running to fulfill their needs and rarely will I see my own. It was also similar to the situation with my x wife. I realise I am damaged.\n\nWhat I am asking is, am I crazy for thinking this way and that she used me, led me on and triggered me? Thinking she is a narcissist? I feel bad when I open up to her. Why do i think of hair when I despair. Am I co dependent ? Is the only solution vanish/ghost so that I can give this new situation a real shot? She respects me and is willing to invest in this and really does. \n\nSorry for the long message I even omitted stuff like when she told what I told her in confidence to other people and made it look like I was running after her. \n\nTL DR: was in a dead bedroom marriage, left, met someone, fell head over heels and ended up being used or at least that's what I believe but I still think about her. Moved on with someone new but think about her some times intensely.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It\u2019s all or nothing. These extremes inform the nature of their relationship, as well as her behaviour.\n\n\n&gt; You can tell me when it's over, mm\n&gt; If the high was worth the pain\n\nShe is alluding to how this will be a roller coaster relationship that will cause him to have feelings of complete love &amp; acceptance, as well as rejection &amp; devaluation.\n\n\n&gt; Got a long list of ex-lovers\n&gt; They'll tell you I'm insane\n\nShe is referring to an established pattern of her previous relationships having identified her psychopathic tendencies.\n\n\n&gt; \u2018Cause you know I love the players\n&gt; And you love the game\n\nShe prefers to let the guy think he\u2019s the one pursuing her as it makes it even easier to manipulate him inside of the relationship.\n\n\n&gt; \u2018Cause we're young and we're reckless\n&gt; We'll take this way too far\n\nShe is using her age as an exceuse for the intensity of the relationship, when really it\u2019s the nature of a typical relationship with a narcisist.\n\n\n&gt; It'll leave you breathless\n&gt; Or with a nasty scar\n\nIf he survives emotionally in-tact, he may reflect on what a whirlwind that relationship wase. But more likely, it will leave him with lasting trauma.\n\n\n&gt; Got a long list of ex-lovers\n&gt; They'll tell you I'm insane\n\nAgain, there are a number of people who can attest to the nature of being in a relationship with her.

I had an eating disorder from 6th to 10th grade.\n5. I was abused by a friend in 7th grade.  My dad said I was lying and was just in the closet. \n6. My dad would wake everyone in the house up when he was jealous that we were sleeping and scream about something that wasn't done around the house. He has sleep apnea and we all kind of  suffer because of it. \n7. My dad just doesn't want to know about anyone's day except his, he loves to talk about his shitty day. Just don't try to say your day was hard. Because obviously it wasn't as hard as his.\n 8. My mom would ask me to  decide if my dad was a dick in a situation. I  was her therapist at times.

He wants us to still talk in 1 week but I think that our relationship is over. I am dealing with some really difficult emotions.We are LDR, had several fights last month, stopped talking for 2 weeks when I discovered he was a covert narc. and planned to discard him. We called yesterday and out of nowhere he was breaking up with me, he said, it's because and I quote: \"We are not compatible\", \"I am not a good boyfriend\", \"there is no chance\", \"we have a lot of fights and we can't solve this\" and when I share with him my days/ life/ struggles that's \"bad energy\", but when he does though he is asking for solutions. He also claimed that the distance and not being physically together is an issue, we were in 6 months LDR before and this was never an issue, we invested in time and made it work. He left me to believe that I am the abusive one.  \n\n\n  \nI was very open throughout the discussion yesterday, asking questions to understand but found myself in disbelieve and trying to find solutions to make it work, he seemed he has already made up his mind about leaving. Although the last days I was sure about ending the relationship and wanted him to discard me, now that he did It is driving me crazy. My thoughts are not straight, I am doubting my self and everything I believed was true. Maybe I overthought everything, maybe he is not a narc. and that I was not abused.  \n\n\n  \nWhat I'm sure of is that I was not fulfilled emotionally, personally or sexually in this relationship, still, I coped with everything for two years to stay with him because we had dreams together. He made me believe that he wants the exact same life I wanted and I thought we were working together to achieve it. Now I feel that he was never committed, when it was easy it was good (the last 2 yrs we were together in the same study program where we met) but as long as it gots difficult and we are apart, he just doesn't want it. I feel I was used and like an idiot for staying for 2 years, trusting he was committed to me and coping with everything. I\u2019m grieving for all the time I wasted on him and I hate that I let him get to decide about the relationship, right to the end. All of this is super hard and has affected my self-esteem.  \n\n\n  \nHe said there is no chance for us, then he brought up the idea of not talking for a week and then talking as if we were not a couple, to \"try to spake something\" and see if it can work. I said ok just to get to talk one last time but don't want to spark anything. I am done with this emotional rollercoaster but I want closure, I want him to know how he has been treating me, I wish he could just understand and say sorry and we leave it there but I am not sure he would.\n\n  \nI don't know what to think of all this or what to do anymore, I need support!  \n\n\n  \nBackground info: We were together for 2yrs, he proposed, I introduced him to my parents, in my culture it is a big deal and means commitment.

{"post_id": "dvv944", "created_utc": 1573667007, "title": "What is a Narcissist? My Personal View (Because I Fell for Another One)", "author": "Suggest_a_User_Name", "self_text": "I'm sorry for how long this post is. I wrote it because I just went through a \"friendship\" with a classic narc. All the signs were there and as I've done before, I ignored them. It got me thinking of my own view and defining features of a narc. These are the major behaviors that I've experienced with my ex-wife narc and a now ex-friend narc. There are no new insights but I think it helps to write things down from ones own perspective:\n\n**They make you think they are the epitome of mental, physical and emotional health.** They will talk about how strong they are compared to others. How they had it so hard but managed to overcome so many obstacles (*so many obstacles\u2026)*. They will make you want to emulate them and admire them for these traits. You will be brainwashed into believing this so that when you start seeing cracks in their perfect mental, physical or emotional health, you will feel bad for seeing those faults or deny their existence (or both). You begin to hide your weaknesses and failures in order to not be humiliated.\n\n**They are amazing mimics. They copy the behaviors of others they consider (and are envious of) being strong.** Example: they copy people who are naturally sociable. They act like such amazing socializers like they know \u201chow-to-work-a-room\u201d. All high fives and \u201chow *you* doin\u2019 \u201c when entering a \u201cscene\u201d (bar, sports game, party events, etc). You\u2019ll be awestruck by how seemingly easy they make \u201cfriends\u201d and can talk to people (so different from you. *\"I wish I could be like them. What's wrong with me?\"* you'll tell yourself). They can *(seem to)* be so much fun. SO much fun. Over time, you\u2019ll discover that they don\u2019t have any real friends or anyone they have a truly deep connection with (past or present). No one who's like the sister or brother they never had. They\u2019ll belittle the same people they were acting so upbeat and happy with just moments before. They\u2019ll tell you how bored they are with certain people. They will say very negative things about \u201cfriends\u201d of theirs that they manage to hang out with frequently and this will make you wonder what they\u2019re saying about you.\n\n**They make you feel so special for a short period of time.** This is the Love Bombing. For a short period of time (how long depends on the situation) the narc will make you feel like the most important person in their lives. They\u2019ll call you and text you multiple times a day. They\u2019ll insist on going out with you and ONLY you. Then slowly, almost imperceptibly their focus on you will start to wane. The daily calls and texting becomes once a day or every other day then once a week and then nothing. Any plans you try to make are delicately thwarted (\u201csorry I can\u2019t. I\u2019m busy then and the next weekend too.\u201d). So you stop contacting them and guess what happens? They reach out to you (because God forbid YOU discard THEM) and suddenly you\u2019re IT again. The cycle starts once again. \n\n**They don\u2019t give a shit about you**. Period. Even during the Love Bomb phase, note how they really never asked you much about your day. If you had some problems to deal with, they\u2019ll \u201clisten\u201d but offer next to nothing of value. Every time you bring up a problem in your life, they will always counter with an issue in their own life. The focus can never be on you. You\u2019re there for them. Not vice versa. You\u2019ll sense this but convince yourself to keep on with them because they\u2019re fun. You\u2019re easily replaced. That\u2019s why they are so masterful at making \u201cfriends\u201d. They need a constant flow of attention from people who don\u2019t know them well. \n\n**They subtly insult you and if you call them on it, they\u2019ll claim you\u2019re overly sensitive.**\n\n**They cannot be criticized even slightly**. Gently tell them something minor like they forgot to turn something off or left something somewhere and I guarantee you they will tell you something that ***you*** did wrong. This could be right after you\u2019ve dared to criticize them or soon after. But it will happen. They never let a criticism go unretaliated. \n\n**They never really apologize.** They\u2019re connoisseurs of the non-apology apology or the \u201capology-but\u201d. That\u2019s where they say \u201cI\u2019m sorry but if you \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ then this would not have happened.\u201d Or something like that. Or the other one is the \u201capology-if\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if what I did (or said) upset you\u2026\u201d. And this one is often also followed by a but. They never feel they\u2019ve really done anything wrong. They\u2019re the victims. They deserve all the apologies. \n\nAnd that last line helps me to summarize the narc: they see themselves as Vicitms. They see themselves like they\u2019re warriors. Soldiering on despite all the bad things that happened to them. I believe that most (all?) narcissists suffered some level of gross emotional and/or physical abuse as children. But they don\u2019t want to deal with that. In fact, I\u2019ve found that most narcs dismiss the issues from their childhood saying things like \u201cit\u2019s all in the past\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m over it.\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m not into that whole blame the parent\u2019s thing. People who do that are weak\u201d. They put on what they think is a brave face. Because they won\u2019t deal honestly with what happened to them and only want to soldier on, they become superficial. Once someone (a friend or lover) tries to get deeper (which is what happens in a good relationship) they can\u2019t handle it and discard them. They can\u2019t get any deeper or introspective because doing so would expose them to the trauma they experienced as a child.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have been through the cycle just once during this time, and I can't imagine going through it all again and again. I've been love bombed, I've been de-valued, and I think I've been discarded over the past 10 days. There's definitely new supply that he's been flaunting in my face. Since then, I decided not to text him or go seeking him out during or after work, for my own sanity. This was really hard, but somehow I managed to succeed in this in the past 10 days. I was feeling better about myself and maybe I was starting to heal a little bit.\n\nThen came yesterday. Yesterday, we had to talk about something work-related, and it turned into a replication of the love bombing phase, where there were compliments, and invitations to hang out and talk. I am not sure if this was hoovering, as it might have just been his attempt at being a supportive boss. I don't know the boundaries anymore. We engaged in text message conversations during the rest of the day for the first time in a few weeks, and I was seeking him out throughout the day. All this, after more than 10 days of me being strong. Why was it so easy for me to eat it all up again? I was able to reach out to a friend and get support during this time, and she reminded me of all the things that had happened over the past few weeks. So, even though every part of me wanted to, I did not take him up on the invitation to hang out and talk, and I stopped texting him at some point, and so did he. Later during therapy, my therapist likened this to a recovering alcoholic being offered a drink at a weak moment.\n\nSo, now I am back to feeling sad and anxious again, and wanting him again, after doing so well. I keep thinking \"Look how nice he was, maybe I made it all up\", or even \"Maybe I blew things up out of proportion and things weren't so bad\", and \"would it really hurt to engage with him again in a friendly manner\".

I\u2019m pretty shaken up right now and I\u2019m sinking quickly into a deep depression. My girlfriend of almost 3 years hit me 2 days ago. We got into an arguement that I initiated because I moved in with her 2 months ago and she\u2019s been really avoidant of me and my dog. She\u2019s been stressing over bills and stuff because she\u2019s been jobless since July. Understandable. Anyway, I initiated the arguement because I was tired of feeling like she was trying to move around me and not talking to me and stuff. We both suck at communication so we were both insulting each other. I will admit that I was being pretty narcissistic in my approach which wasn\u2019t helpful. But she was not doing any better. Eventually, things blew up and I told her to shut the fuck up because she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. She stood up really fast and lunged across the bed and swipe at me. She missed the first one. I didn\u2019t even have time to realize what she was trying to do until she got on top of me and pulled my locs and held my face down and punched me. She also had her knee in my back. I freaked out and cried and this instigated a meltdown for me where I started to beat myself and scream. She then flipped the script and tried to stop me from hurting myself. This makes things worse. I kicked a hole in the wall trying to free myself from her arms. Once she let go of me, I froze and just stood over the bed crying. She walked to the other side of the bed and sat down in disbelief of what she just did. I then began to yell at her saying what have you done! What would you do that! I never hit you! Then I went over and grabbed her shirt and started shaking her violently and slamming her back into the dresser just repeating myself. Then I let her go. I then went to the bathroom and realized I was bleeding. Then I spent about 2 hours just yelling at her about why she was wrong. How she shouldn\u2019t have done that. How was I going to explain this to my psychiatrist that I see in a couple of days. \n\nNow here\u2019s the important piece that makes it extremely complicated. We both have dissociative identity disorder. So basically it was her alter that attacked my alter. I have 2 very young alters in my system that witnessed this event that have an extensive abuse history. The alter in my system that started it wasn\u2019t either one of them but she\u2019s a teenager. My girlfriend\u2019s alter that attacked me is a grown man. I am way more control of my alters than she is. I see a therapist and take meds. She does not. \n\nSo the question is what do I do? I obviously am extremely hurt and my trust is shattered. But I also admit that I contributed to this. But at the end of the day, I would never hit her. Even though my protective alter really wanted to. This is not something that is normal that happens. I know she feels guilty because of how she acted after it happened and while I was yelling at her. I thought about maybe laying out clear boundaries for her troublesome alter. But is it really worth it? I just need some advice because I\u2019m hurting bad emotionally and I can\u2019t stop sinking.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Join me if you want...\n\nLet's start off with one story not quite at the beginning, but close to it.\n\nWe were in college, our Sophomore year. At this point I was really good friends with my narc, but hated his girlfriend.  She always stuck me as really dramatic, needing a lot of attention. She always seemed to be making things about her, which rubbed me the wrong way.  My narc came off as boorish and selfish as well at times, but also very introspective at times and fun-loving.  I saw his socially unacceptable qualities as the by-product of being young and immature still, also sheltered and naive to the lives of people not like him. (He grew up in a wealthy, conservative, evangelical home) I perceived his time in a diverse college as slowly improving that aspect of his personality.\n\nWell, one day his girlfriend was suddenly telling everyone that he broke up with her, and that he had been physically abusive towards her.  She said that he had gotten angry and grabbed her and squeezed really tightly, hurting her.  I did not believe this, and I marched right over to my Narc and told him what I had heard and asked him what happened.  He seemed really distraught, and said that she had broken up with him, not the other way around.  Also, that he had no idea what she was talking about re: abuse.  He offered that maybe he had squeezed her \"affectionately\" at one point and accidentally did it too hard but that she had never said anything about it.  I believed his story, thinking she was saying all this about him to seem more sympathetic, and win people to her side.\n\nWell, lines were drawn, and friendships were lost.  His side was mostly just him and me.  I was sad that I had lost most of my college friends in one fell swoop, but I was defending the (as I saw it then) \"falsely accused.\"  I felt like I was defending the truth and felt good about it, and my friend and I were closer than ever.  The narc was now my best friend and half a year after that we started dating.\n\nIn retrospect:\n\n1. Dear God, he didn't have to find me I literally ran to him waving an \"I'm a good victim\" flag.\n2. BELIEVE. VICTIMS. I feel sick over how I treated his ex-girlfriend.  Years later, when he physically abused me for the first time it dawned on me that his story back then had been a lie.  He confirmed this by telling me that \"\\[He\\] had told \\[me\\] back then and \\[I\\] just didn't care, so why do \\[I\\] care now?\" I now struggle with feeling like I deserve the abuse for what I said and did to her, and maybe I do.\n3. How much better would my life be now if I had kept the other friends and not him?  I think about this parallel, better, life often.

A few days ago, we had been texting back and forth about her day at school for a couple of hours when she told me something that was similar to an experience I had had that day. So I responded with essentially \"Oh, that's like how...\" and her response was to change the subject. This happens nearly every time we speak. And I don't mind talking about her, but it really starts to feel sometimes like she doesn't care about what I have to say. She's even accused me of not contributing enough to conversations. When I point out that she changes the subject on me a lot, she shut down again. Is this a form of abuse? Or is this just misinterpreting how we communicate?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I think all the talk on yt about Onision and how he groomed teenagers really resonated with my experiences. For the longest time, I thought that I had simply been fooled by a very selfish fuckboy. But now, I am certain that I dealing with a textbook narcissist and possible psychopath. I\u2019m doing an autopsy of the situation to get my mind at ease as I properly process all of these events as I should\u2019ve (instead of sweeping them under the rug...). I learned and grew from my experiences, but I also want to fully understand what happened and call it like it is.\n\nWhen I was 17, during my first winter break in college, my cousin introduced me to a guy that was 21. Upon meeting me, he eagerly started pursuing me. We had a lot in common so we had great conversations. Unlike guys my age, he initially seemed to be interested in my mind rather than my body. And according to him, it \u201cwas not everyday that he met a girl that has all the same interests as him\u201d. I lived in a different town for a couple months and he was always one text away from brightening up my day or getting me through difficult times. It got physical fairly early on when I would visit him, but I would set boundaries and never went all the way at first. I was very sexually inexperienced so I would only do a little at a time, and then he\u2019d seem a little disappointed and would stop love-bombing me. I became addicted to his words of validation and company, so if I got the chance to be physical with him, I would give a little more and more each time. He would be content for a while with every \u201cnew thing\u201d, but then would become indifferent to me unless I did a little more next time. I felt addicted to his attention, caresses and overall company. Thus, I\u2018d feel like a little extra physical discomfort would be better than days of emotional agony.\n\nI transferred to a school in his town upon turning 18 (this was the plan before I even met him). While we had been a little sexual when I was 17 (legal as that\u2018s the age of consent in my state), he didn\u2019t ask for nudes until my exact 18th birthday. Probably to avoid getting in trouble. After a couple months of following the same pattern, plus him finally announcing that he didn\u2019t want to be in an actual relationship with me despite already getting me addicted, I lost my virginity to him. This only grew into very hardcore sex, which demanded more and more each time. With every new thing that was offered on the table (mostly his ideas, such as anal, double penetration with toys, etc) he would get happier and fill me with caresses, . I sometimes didn\u2019t feel ready or didn\u2019t want to do these things, and he would \u201crespect that\u201d but also proceed to ignore me for the next couple days. When that happened, I felt like I was yanked from my fix like a drug addict, so I would succumb to whatever he wanted eventually. It gradually also become a matter of me \u201cnot trusting him enough\u201d.  For instance, he would sometimes want me to send him videos of me shoving phallic objects inside me while he was at work. When I didn\u2019t want to, he would go on about how much he trusted me, how it irked him that I didn\u2019t trust him enough, how ridiculous it was for me to think that these videos weren\u2019t just for him. \n\nI also had demands of my own, perfectly reasonable ones at that. Since he always wanted to have raw sex (I was on birth control), I wanted us to be sexually exclusive to avoid catching something from him. I would see him on Tinder and get mad, demanding that we use a condom or break it off. I would also want him to not flirt with other girls in front of my friends and family out of respect for me. And I would want him to delete sexually explicit videos of me and show me proof of it. In response to these demands, he would call me crazy, overwhelming and tell me to \u201cstop acting to so weird because we\u2019re not dating\u201d, as if STDs care about that. \n\nA a few more months passed and there was no longer anything \u201cnew\u201d for me to do, so my novelty wore off. There were no more dinners or caresses, just quick, rough sex. At this point, I tried leaving the situation as I wasn\u2019t getting \u201cmy fix\u201d anymore, just feeling like shit 100% of the time. After a few months of no contact and him constantly trying to reach out to me, I finally told him that I didn\u2019t want to have sex with him anymore or allow him to treat me like that. He was shocked, but \u201crespected my decision\u201d , didn\u2019t want to mess with my emotions\u201d and \u201cjust wanted to be friends\u201d. Next time I saw him, he kissed me and acted like he wanted to be with me. Next time after that, he shoved his dick in me without a condom right after I explicitly told him that I would no longer have unprotected sex with him (even told him that I was no longer on birth control). He left me crying on my bed alone that night. Lastly, he blocked me, unblocked me months after to say I was \u201coverwhelming at the time\u201d and said that \u201che just wanted to be friends\u201d. I never saw him again.\n\nIt\u2019s been over a year since I closed this chapter, and I\u2019ve learned quite a ton from it. I no longer put up with disrespect, know my worth and immediately notice red flags. I heard he got an actual girlfriend soon after he last reached out to me, in fact it was the \u201cfriend from high school\u201d that he brought to my cousin\u2019s house right before I lost my virginity to him. Feel bad for what she\u2019s going through more than anything (heard he made her cry in front of everyone at his Fourth of July party...). I\u2019ve graduated from college fairly young, work as an engineer now making a comfortable salary and my life is pretty awesome overall. Comes to show that a low self-esteem doesn\u2019t discriminate, since you\u2019d think that I\u2019d be the last person to be involved in a situation like this. Although everything\u2019s great, I clearly have this situation in my mind still. I no longer feel guilt, shame or pain regarding anything that happened. But I feel like I really needed to share these thoughts somewhere and try to make sense out of them. Feel free to share any observations or similar experiences. Is there anything particular that he did that could fall under one of the narcissist labels? Also, does it seem like he\u2019s just a narcissist, or did he perhaps fit beyond, maybe in psychopath territory?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm a grown-ass 30-year-old woman. I'm a business-owner. I'm a friendly, good person. I'm a hard worker. Because of recent events with my own family I'm becoming aware that I'm a highly empathetic internalizer and folks like me often get negative, externalizers like magnets to them. This includes Narcissistic people, so I'm learning.\n\nI believe I have a dear friend who has NPD. He never sees my point of view. Everything is always my fault. My best intentions (like simply asking \"how are you!\") are labeled as me being a nag, being annoying, being irritating. He is suspicious, paranoid, mean. He attacks out of the blue. He uses my vulnerabilities against me as ammo, to hurt me. He is volatile, with extreme mood swings. Throws the baby out with the bathwater and views things in extremes. Tells me I've hurt him and made him feel badly, but refuses to tell me how/when/why or how to change/fix/resolve it.\n\nThis relationship is sucking my energy dry. I've never been more frustrated or confused in any kind of relationship - friendship, family, romantic, or otherwise. I feel like I give and give and give to this person and they give nothing back. He SAYS he does, but he never can articulate what, exactly, he does for me. I seem to always contact HIM at inconvenient times, interrupting his flow and concentration on whatever he's doing, but he can never understand how he might possibly contact ME at an inconvenient time. I'm never allowed to say \"no\" to HIS needs, but he's always got a valid excuse to not address my needs.\n\nHe's the expert on everything, even things I'm LITERALLY arguably an expert in (I have a music degree, but my tastes and opinions are \"bullshit,\" of course). My opinions, view points and opinions never seem to hold any sway or have any validity. And BOY does all his behavior get worse with drinking, which happens every night. (There's a fine line where he's actually quite wonderful with a few drinks, but when he crosses the line it's BAAAD.)\n\nFrom everything I've read on this sub, and in articles online, this is a relationship I need to cut off and walk away from, period. That narcissists never change, they don't feel anything real for me, they don't care, etc. and I need to just be done.\n\nBut I can't help but think - - he's a person too, right? He has feelings. He has hopes and dreams and desires. I KNOW there's a crumb of care for me in there somewhere. I see glimpses of light and realness inside. He's not a robot. Right?...Right??\n\nI worry that, being one of his only friends and supports, he'll spiral if I cut him off completely. He's talked of suicide, even so far as to tell me his plans. This was almost 6 months ago, now, and I alerted his family members at the time, so at least someone other than myself is aware of this line of thinking. He hasn't talked of it in a while, but I still worry that if I cut him off completely from friendship with me, he might spiral into self-harm.\n\nI don't know what to do.\n\nHe lives in another state - we became friends via text due to a work collaboration. We've only met in person once. But we text daily. It was fun and uplifting and funny and mutually good at the beginning. EARLY on (like, 10 days into knowing one another) he expressed feelings for me. I entertained that for a bit, and developed some feelings too, but as of this summer really came down on expressing I could only be friends because his behavior made it too difficult for me to harbor romantic feelings. It opened me up to too much hurt.\n\nHe's often expressed that \"people always leave\" and threatens I'm \"already gone.\" His fear of abandonment has me wondering if he's actually more Borderline Personality Disorder than NPD, but I don't know. I'm not a professional. There's DEFINITELY something not right going on though.\n\nThat's another reason I'm hesitant to cut off completely - I don't want to prove him right. I want to show him there is good in this world, that there are people who will show up for you. But - he doesn't show up for me. He demeans me and belittles me. I've never second-guessed myself moreso than I have in the last year and a half of knowing him. My confidence has plummeted. My other relationships are suffering. I don't want him to feel abandoned. I care for him and it makes me so sad to think of him being sad, lonely, angry, and alone. But I can't be a human punching bag. I don't deserve it.\n\nWhat do I do?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It started around when I was 8 my parents would well fight in front of me and when I say fight mean they would scream, throw things, call each other names (more like scream names at each other), and threaten divorce and threaten to leave. Obviously me being my age I would beg them and plead with them not to and well they never did. But this would lead them to pull me aside after every single fight which were almost daily and proceed to tell me how unhappy and upset and sad they were and how they fake their happiness and how it is all my fault they would always emphasize that part. They would also pull me aside and bad mouth each other and tell me how bad the other one was. I believe that this played a part in the current severe anxiety and depression I deal with which my parents are aware of and still refuse to get me help even though i have been diagnosed. After the fighting stopped which ended around 12 (my parents are still together) I am currently 15 and the abuse that is currently going on has been going on since i was around 10 or 11. My dad calls me a pussy, and a bitch, and an asshole, and a fucktard. He has openly told me that he does not see me as his son and that he thinks that I am nothing and he has told me that \"I waited my entire life for a son and instead I got you\". This happens quite often and ever since he found out about my depression and anxiety he will openly mock me about it. Recently during an argument he 1. said that he knows what he does hurts me and that he is bullying me and 2. he then said why don't you go and kill yourself. So he basically told me to kill myself and then said get out but wouldn't let me leave. He then maybe 30 min later was all happy and like i'm worried about you and this happens all the time and it really messes with my head. My mom knows that this is going on and does nothing about it and sometimes says he's right. They both also blame a lot of stuff on me that are their own faults and then after I had just recently gotten out of a very manipulative and abusive relationship and they both said its all my fault and then said that they were the victims of it and that they were affected more than I was. Both of my grandparents say that I fake my anxiety and depression and then scream at me and say that I hurt them and that I am not their grandson anymore. My grandmother screams at me in the car every time i'm with her and yells that if I don't change she will kill herself. So I have no idea what to do just I need some advise please because idk if i can make it through three more years of this.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I was born male with a single mother. My mother was an alcoholic and when she was drunk she was violent or at least angry. Other things to know is starting around 8 my mother had no problem talking to me about the details of her sexual desires, realtionships, and encounters. Nothing directed sexually towards me. I assume she liked to talk to me about it because in her mind I was the only male that could truly understand her being that we were mother and son. We were also constantly moving, averaging close to moving  twice a year. She also persistently hated men and told me they were all evil myself included. She also hated that I looked so much like my father.\nThe earliest bad memory I have was when I was 3 years old. A woman took me and put me in the back of an SUV. My mother was married to my adoptive father at this time and the woman was his girlfriend. My mother ran to stop her and when the woman shut her door, my mother punched her through the window. With fists full of glass my mother repeatedly punched the woman. All the while the woman was begging my mother to stop she didn't let up even a little. My adoptive father grabbed my mother to stop her but my mother broke free and got a few more good punches full of glass on the woman. The woman crying laid her head down on the dashboard as my mother was pulled away from her. I was watching closely as the woman's blood squirted on my face and down my neck. I felt paralyzed, everything was moving so fast and I didnt know what to do. All I know today is the woman survived the mass blood loss but had severe facial scarring. My mother received community service and anger management. \n    Some time after this my mother went drinking and driving. She ran a red light and got in a wreck. I recieved a concussion and a scar in the back of my head from the glass that pierced through my skin. After this it wasn't so bad for a little while. My mother got in crazy arguments with boyfriends but that was it. \nThings picked up when I turned 8. She got a new boyfriend, he was a married man and we lived with him. I didnt like him and being 8 I wasn't good at hiding that, and so he knew. They were always fighting. It go so bad we had leave for motels and then in a week or so we kept coming back. Then one bad night happened and my mother took me in her car and they were yelling again. My mother tried burning him with her lighter and he tried choking her while she reversed slowly out of his driveway. My mother went crusing in the bad part of town trying to find prostitutes. She started yelling at them and told me if I didnt yell at them with her I wouldn't get any food. So we yelled at random prostitutes all night long until the sun came up. We stayed at a motel and again we went back to him. \nI went to the beach and got a bad sun burn on my back. when I returned to his home I guess it was annoying that I was complaining about it too much. He threw me to the the ground and stepped on my back. We left again and came back yet again the same day. It was night time and my mother was drinking heavily. She was also smoking, she she fell asleep with a lit ciggerate in her mouth. The curtains caught fire and soon enough the house. When he returned home to the the sight and saw my mother trying to put out the fire. He hit her, and then he took a baseball bat and with one swing he unhinged a part of her jaw from her face. I was asleep during this time. I woke sometime later. I heard sirens calling my name. I stepped out of my room and saw the house on fire and the first thing I heard was what sounded like a shotgun being loaded. As quietly as I could without making any planks creek and as fast as I could while avoiding the fire and smoke I got out of there. After opening the front door I saw more cop cars than I ever have before in my life. I immediately saw my mother being taken away in an ambulance in the background behind the police cars.\nAt this point I was taken into foster care. I didn't like it at all. The foster parents didnt care about me and it bothered me greatly. It was a place I lived at but nothing too crazy happened. I was eventually taken out of the foster system because they found my mothers parents. The people my mother tried hard hiding from the courts so I lived in foster care something like a year and a half because of it. \nI met my grandparents for the first time at 10 years old. Grandparents are something I had a hard time understanding at this age as I didn't know what relatives were or how they were related to me exactly. The social worker in the car who took me to them tried to explain what grandparents were but somehow I didnt exactly understand. I just accepted they were close to my mother somehow. From here it was back and forth with me living with my grandparents and then my mom. My mother kept going to jail for drinking and driving so I didnt see her much over the next few years. When she got out I was 12 and she went drinking and driving with me to go see a new boyfriend of hers in jail. She got pulled over and I had to wait at the station. The officers told me if no one picked me up they were going to send me to juvenile detention. Luckily I was picked up, I had known 2 friends numbers by heart. After this my mother was in jail for all of middle school.\nI was 14 and she got out and we got a new house. Things were generally calmer when I turned 15 things of a different nature started happening. My mother became more open talking about sex than ever. She became ever too comfortable talking about niche fetishes of hers. She started talking to me about a certain I'll call it a fetish I dont really know how to address it. She started talking about certain animal gentailia a lot. She even went so far as to show me pornagrphy about the subject. It was like a phase of hers she wouldn't stop talking about it for a long while. She even invited a friend of hers over and ever so nonchalantly they were talking about it as if it were normal. However that was the end of that.\n  Things were generally normal and not so weird for a little while until I was 16 and it was my junior year of highschool. My mother was constantly drunk and getting angry and she started attacking me in her anger. She would really try her best to hurt me like we were really fighting and I felt so paralyzed fending off my own mother from hitting me. In one moment I froze not trying to hurt my mother and she bite my arm. Trying to run away she threw me down the basement stairs and tried throughing wrenches at my downstairs part. In another struggle fight all I could do was grab her punches to stop her from hitting me. It wasn't good enough and she punches me in the face hard. I was wearing glasses and she took the opportunity to dig and squirm the metal bridge down into my nose, it cut through me like butter. One day she was so angry yelling at me she cut her self and started writing in the kitchen walls that I was a pig. She kept writing this all over the kitchen repeatedly until she had no more blood left and it was written everywhere. Another day I woke up for school and the walls said fuck you everywhere. I eventually stopped living with my mother and entered my adult life early.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

In fact I felt relieved that he wasn't a malignant one that would endeavour to physically harm/stalk me.\n\nIn the wake of the destruction however, I do find myself still reeling over doubts on myself despite being over the trauma bonding. Yesterday night I became an insecure mess that I sent my closest trusted friends a text that I loved them and I hope that they'll never leave, and that if I did anything wrong, not to hold it in but just to tell me. Granted they were a bit puzzled and worried I might do something silly, but all of them were very understanding and many told me they loved me too.\n\nI still do worry about whether I'm the narc and try to catch myself from doing certain things - sometimes I'd go off on a tangent when I had another epiphany about the narc, and then apologise for going off on a tangent and emotionally unloading on them but the receiving party has said that it wasn't anything to worry about on my part at all.\n\nI'm very secure about some things like the quality of the output of my work, or being a good enough person, but when it comes to closer interpersonal relations I'm still an insecure mess.

The conversation below is one example of what it\u2019s like to have a discussion with him. I\u2019m not so much interested in opinions about the actual conversation (wearing his seatbelt) but more about his overall behavior throughout it because this is his typical behavior in all of our discussions/disagreements. \n\nExample: \n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t have a habit of wearing his seat belt every time he drives. There are times when I go places with him and I notice that he will drive without it on and the car will ding as a reminder to wear it but he might not notice and I will ask him to put it on. After this happened one day, I gently told him that it concerns me that he doesn\u2019t make a habit of putting his seat belt on before he starts driving. He\u2019s putting his life at risk and setting a poor example for our kids. If he were to be injured or killed it would have a great effect on all of us. He denied that he neglects to wear his seatbelt all the time. I pointed out  that I had just asked him to put his seat belt on a moment ago and he responded by saying that he doesn\u2019t do that all the time. I explained that there are many times when I\u2019m with him and he forgets and I ask him to put it on. I\u2019m also aware that he will drive short distances (a few miles) and not put it on at all. After going back and forth about weather he actually does forget to put his seatbelt on he said that he just forgets sometimes. I asked him if he could try to get in the habit of putting it on before he starts driving. He said, \u201cStarting a new habit is hard. You aren\u2019t asking me to break a habit, you\u2019re asking me to start one which is harder to do.\u201d \nI expressed that it\u2019s important to me that he try to develop that habit. He said, \u201cYour living out of fear. Anything can happen at any time and you can\u2019t control that,\u201d I said that I\u2019m aware of that but just as we buckle the kids up, not only because it\u2019s the law but because we love and care about their wellbeing, I care about his so it\u2019s important that he make every effort to increase the chances that nothing bad happens to him. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to control me.\u201d I told him this isn\u2019t about control, I genuinely care about him. He said, \u201cYou\u2019re not my mother. I am the one who has control over whether or not I wear my seatbelt.\u201d I told him I know that but what I\u2019m asking him to do is take into account how I feel about it and how it could impact the rest of his family if he doesn\u2019t put it on and gets into an accident. He stands by his thoughts that it\u2019s his choice and I\u2019m acting like I\u2019m his mother. Last night while we were driving, after the car had been dinging a reminder for a while, I asked him to put his seatbelt on because he\u2019d forgotten to again. \n\nWhat are your thoughts? I believe he is showing some narcissistic behaviors but I would really appreciate an outside perspective.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I thought I could handle dating people and logging down my findings to maybe help someone else out. Considering I have stage 4 cancer and really don't think I have time to find my person. \n\nNot a good idea! Monday evening I went on a second date (yes second). He invited me over for dinner with me and his mom. To meet her. Red flag #1 (too soon to meet the mother) . He picked me up from my apartment. (Never do this so soon please). I introduced him to my roommate and gave her his info to be safe (I thought). He was kind of rude to her and nothing like the first date. He actually questioned her like she was an idiot about something she said she was doing. He made her speechless. Threw her off. She just thought he was a know it all. (Red flag #2) I should never have left with him. \nWe get to his house and my gut was telling me something wasn't right. (Red flag #3) It was far too clean and far too quiet. His mom was very nice to me but didn't even speak to him. Just a heavy vibe in the house. He took me to his room that had a sofa and tv. I met his sweet puppy that seemed far to disciplined for a 4 month old. There was a bit of dog blood in the dog bed and I asked what happened. He said the dog moved while cutting his nails and he got a \"bleeder\". I have dogs and this happened to me all the time. I'm sure u can see where this is going. I blew it off. \nHe cooked a really good steak dinner while I sat at the bar stools and watched. The WHOLE time talking and talking and talking (ok you get it) about himself (red flag #4) and how\"good\" he is because he has done some bad things and NEVER got in trouble for them. (Red flag#5) Things like DUI with loaded firearms and bar fights. He's so GOOD that he knows people in law enforcement and judges and the like. He was a virgin until age 19. He was a church boy, but was kicked out of the church. Hmm? Because there was a rumor he had been sleeping with the pastors 14 year old daughter! I just sat there and listened to him tell on himself. (They always do). All I really wanted to do was get out of there. I felt really scared. When dinner was finished his mom came to get her plate and said \" thanks for cooking, it looks really good, you did a great job, you are awesome, etc. Then walked off in the living room. She said these things really fast and all together like I typed it. (Red flag#6 for me) She never said another word to him. Hmm?\nAfter dinner he cleaned up the dishes and we went in his room. (All the while I was trying to find a way to get out of there without setting him off.) I knew he was a ticking time bomb because I saw anger boil up if I even So much as asked him a question about what he was talking about. His face would take on a demonic look. (Red flag#7) I was trying to be polite and show him that I was interested in what he was saying by asking a question here and there. I felt like he didn't want me to even speak. (The mother didn't speak to him) I see why now. \nThis talking about himself went on for about an hour after dinner and it was getting scarier and more worrisome the longer he spoke. I at this point tried to lighten the mood by asking him to play music. Well his music. I asked him if I could play a song I liked after listening to him go on about himself the WHOLE time. Ugh. That was a BAD idea! He walked off because the dog needed to go out. At that very moment. I blew this off as being distracted. (Red flag #8) He came back in and I had my song ready to play and started to play it. He walked off again! Don't remember why, but he did. I was so over it at this point and asked him why he didn't want to listen to ONE song I wanted to hear. He yelled at me and said \"play the goddamn song for God's sake!\" Wow! I was shocked! I immediately started crying. Bad idea! But couldn't hold it back. I tried. \nMeanwhile, the dog was bouncing around and he told it to go lay down. The dog jumped on his bed instead. Being a puppy. He proceeded to pick the dog up by its skin. Its a big puppy(pit bull) and throw it in its bed. The dog layed there frozen. It didn't move a muscle. It was terrified! So was I!  Oh yeah! Earlier he had told his mother about the spot of blood in the dogs bed and explained it to her. He also told her that since I was over there the dog wasn't listening to him. His mother replied by saying, \" I know you will make sure the dog listens to you. I have no doubt about that!\" ( I'm going to count this as red flag # 9 because at the time she said it, this incident hadn't happened.) \nWell as soon as he threw the poor little puppy (remember 2nd date) I knew I HAD to get out of there and I was not safe. I politely as I could told him that I had to go because I had things to do for my parents. I was afraid! Didn't want him to know, but I'm sure he did because the tears in my eyes. I also screamed No no no! When he picked up the dog like that! \nWell I started calling people for a ride. (Don't EVER not have a back up plan while dating. I learned the hard way. And have enough money for a cab or uber) I finally got a hold of my 96 year old grandpa and he was coming to get me. This guy started yelling obscenities at me and saying things like \"why isn't anyone coming\" and \"why aren't you gone yet\" plus a lot of nasty names he was calling me. Yeah 2nd date! Ugh. Not counting this as a red flag because it's so obviously wrong. \nAs I was gathering my things. I started feeling very woozy. I started feeling sick. I headed to the bathroom to throw up. And my legs went out from underneath me. I got up and made it to the bathroom just in time to vomit my guts out! Not sure why but it was terrible. After that I grabbed my bags and ended up sitting on the curb waiting on grandpa. He doesn't do GPS so it was taking awhile. Plus he's 96 and drives slowly. (I don't remember at all How I got to the curb )  The guy tried to keep getting me to come inside, but I politely declined. Ugh. I was terrified! I felt very Wierd. Not sure if it was pure anxiety making my legs collapse and me throwing up, but I felt drugged. This guy kept going in and out of the house and at one point he snatched the phone out of my hand while I was directing grandpa to me. He got on there and said \" I don't mean any disrespect, but when are you going to be here!\" Wow! As soon as grandpa pulled up he was gone. Garage closed, gone! I know I made many many mistakes and hindsight is 20\\20, so please don't judge me. My mind was confused my legs were collapsing and I was so so sick for some reason. I know now that I should be just called 911, but also know why I didn't. I was so conditioned by my ex of 10 years Not to involve police, plus this guy so much as told me he is untouchable. I did file a report about the dog also as they have recently made animal abuse a felony. Since the guy never touched me the police could only make a report, but the dog They will investigate him on. I'm really scared and this guy will know it was me who filed because I had to tell the police the story of him throwing the dog by its skin. He's gonna know it's me. I thought I learned enough to be able to handle a narcissist, but take it from me NOBODY can. I wanted to share with you all in hopes of maybe someone being saved by my mistakes. I am currently hiding out at my parents house and my daddy has a shotgun by the door and will protect me. I'm so worried about my roommate as she's there alone at my apartment.

I really cannot tell if my husband is a narcissist or just a jerk. \n\nSome examples:\n\n1. His memory for slights is infinite and he'll bring them up at any time, especially during arguments. I, however, cannot mention times he's hurt me because that's making him feel bad and he apologized already. He's actually hurt me very badly in the past and we've never discussed it because that just means I'm trying to make him feel guilty.\n2. He gets really upset over things like spilled coffee on the couch, wrecked towels, stains on the carpet. He has flipped out over these things. I've said I'll replace the towel, for example, and he yelled, \"WHEN? WHENNNNNNN?!\" Just completely freaking out. Over a towel.\n3. If I am perceived to be criticizing him, yelling, scolding or nagging, he goes into what he calls retreat mode. I call it emotionally abusive silent treatment that can last up to a week, but potato, potahto. He did once treat me like I didn't exist for an entire week. Over what, I can't remember, because I just don't log this shit like he does, although I wish I did because his recall of my negative actions is so much better than mine that I'm often wondering if I'm the asshole. \n4. He says he frequently apologizes first, but it's only because when he gives me the silent treatment, I don't react at all. I just let him do his thing. The job of breaking the silence falls on him and he resents this and sees me as the problem. \n5. Brushes away my bringing up negative behavior by asking me to cite really specific dates and times and examples of said behavior. Otherwise, well, it just didn't happen.\n6. Actions while he's drunk don't count because he doesn't remember them. Sometimes I can get an apology out of him, but if I do, it's grudging.\n7. He's generally put upon and angry. He won't volunteer because \"Who's helping me?\" He has almost no friends and the ones he does are either from work or ones I brought to the relationship. Old friends don't get in touch with him much. He constantly worries about what others have that he doesn't and is bitter about it. He's frequently in victim mode and to hear him tell it, everyone is against him, his life sucks, his job sucks and no one could possibly have it worse.\n8. There are differing standards. His for me are very high. His for himself are flexible. When he fucks up/snaps at me/makes a mistake, well, haha, let's just all move on and not talk about it. When I fuck up, it's a daylong discussion and argument and \"Why would you do that?' \"What makes you talk like that to me?\"\n\nThat's not to say he's like that all the time. Much of the time, he's funny, smart, supportive and enjoyable to be around. We have a lot of fun together and shared niche interests. From the outside, I know a lot of people envy our relationship.\n\nHe used to be much, MUCH worse. He'd drunkenly rage and scream at me for hours over perceived slights. I once recorded him because I was so appalled and he made me delete it rather than listen to how unhinged he sounded. He used to act like I had to devote all my time and energy to him and nothing else. A lot of it changed because I don't let anyone tell me what to fucking do, so he just gave up on that. His last rage session was several years ago.\n\nHe's in therapy, but after a few weeks of progress, it's stalled. He has an excellent therapist, so I don't know what's going on. \n\nI'm just really exhausted with this nonsense. I've never argued with someone so much, never spent so much time managing someone else's damn feelings. It's tiring.\n\nIs he a narcissist? Is there hope?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

If i want to go pick up my oldest, he gets mad and says he will go. Then says i just don\u2019t want to deal with the kids. Sometimes, it\u2019s nice to get away even if it\u2019s just for 5 minutes. Then the kids usually don\u2019t want me to leave, so he says see, i should have just went. And then says he has to be the bad guy for getting them away from the door. Is there any other option besides leaving? I don\u2019t know how to get this anxiety to go away!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Sorry if there's errors I'm mobile.. this is a story of a pedo.. so.. you've been warned\n\nWhen I was younger my parents invited their old family friends to live with us (a man and a woman) in our guest bedroom. I'll name the man John/he and the woman Jane. They were probably about mid - late 40's.\n\nWhen they first came I was so happy their family was very close to mine and I heard that they were having a rough time. I was 12(f) at the time I think. They also happened to be my godparents so that was great. John would always take me out to places and buy me things. Which always made me happy and felt needed. I was the youngest child out of 5 siblings so I loved all the attention I received from him. I thought of him as a second dad. \n\nLooking back he did alot of things that weren't acceptable of a grown man to do with a child. He when he would sneak into my room and wake me up to watch late night movies while my parents were sleeping and he would always put his arms around me but I would move away. There was one time in particular that was very disturbing. We were watching movies late at night as usual. Something slipped or he changed the channel as he was getting up to use the bathroom to what I thought was a bad intro to a terrible movie. He comes back and as some terrible dialouge past the movie turned out to be a porno! The sex scene just started and I covered my eyes (bc I'm not allowed to watch kissing on tv). The kissing kept going on so I just decided to leave and go to sleep instead of staying to watch the porno. As far as I know he continued to watch it. I knew he continued to watch it cause I could faintly hear it from my room... \n\nTHIS is what really bugs me...My mom and Jane had gone out to the store and my dad worked late at night. The only people in the house were my siblings and John... \n\n My older sister and I were playing hide and seek. I hid from my sister in our living room and I was waiting for her to come find me. After 5 minutes she couldn't find me so I left that spot and went to another one. I knocked on John's door and told him I was hiding from my sister. He let me in of course and he told me to hide on the bed and covered me with a blanket. After 5 or 10 minutes after I figured she wasn't going to find me so I came out of hiding and started watching tv with him. The tv was sitting on the floor so I sat in front of it and he was sitting behind me. John told me to sit on his lap so he could see too so I did.. halfway through my a really cool movie (planet terror). In my pariphrial vision I could see that he was looking at me and doing something with his mouth. He started talking to me about something and he leaned in and kissed me with tongue. His disgusting tongue rubbed against my closed mouth and nearly licked my whole lower face. His breath smelled like cigarettes and was just terrible. He told me to open my mouth and kiss him and I said No, so he continued to lick my mouth and face.. idk what happened after that nothing bad I don't think but next thing I heard was my mom and Jane coming back home. THANK GOD.\n\nLater that night I went into my parents room and woke my mom what had happened. I cried to her and begged her to not leave for work in the morning bc I was scared of what would happen in the morning. I cried myself to sleep while in my mom's arms. When I woke up she wasnt there because she had gone to work.. the next day was probably a Saturday bc my dad was home and off of work. I think we were going to go on a family trip and bring John and Jane with us... \n\nMy dad had gone into the backyard with my siblings.. proabably to grab something? Idk. But that left me alone in the house with John again. I tried to go outside and he closed the blinds and leaded me towards his room door and tried to kiss me again, but thankfully one of my sisters came back inside and he backed off. \n\nMy mom later told my dad after she got off of work... my dad led John outside and all I could hear was screaming from my dad. I later found out he called me a \"lying whore\" and denied everything...\n\nThere's more to this story and this isn't where is ends but I feel like I've ranted too much today and I'm already feeling like shit. I'll add an edit later today or maybe tomorrow or something.. \n\nSorry it was long and I didn't finish.. it's just too much right now.\n\nEdit:  There was also a time where he had encouraged me to take a bath with his granddaughter while he watched.. and I regrettably did.. I also forgot to mention that he told me not to tell my parents or else I would get in trouble but I knew it was wrong.. Which is why I told my parents anyways.\n\n\nAfter that my parents called me into their bedroom. My parents were sitting on their bed with Jane. Jane gave me a sort of dirty look but I feel like she never really liked me. My parents told me to wait near the closet so they could talk to Jane for about 20-30 minutes and then called me back.\n\nI can't remember what Jane said word for word but I remember she said that this wasn't the first time this has happened. I think there was maybe 1 or 2 girls he had done this to before. \n\nTHIS TERRIFIED ME. THIS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE AND MY PARENTS HAD LET IN A PREDATOR. AND THIS WOMAN JANE WAS JUST AS BAD FOR KNOWING AND LETTING IT HAPPEN ANYWAS. (Most of my siblings are female)\n\nI was scared of being in trouble. I forgot what happened after that but I remember that she was making jokes and my parents were chuckling.. I thought I was going to be in trouble so I didn't speak and just sat there..\n\nAfter that we had left for the weekend and went to a family arcade..\n\nI think a week had passed.. through that week.. I asked my parents why they didn't send him to jail or call the police. I didn't know where he was or if he had bugged the house with cameras.. I felt alone.. They had no answer for me.. \n\nI felt that they could have done more to just.. put him away.. i wanted him to just go to jail.. my siblings were there but I hadn't gone into detail about what had happened.. I was pretty much alone throughout highschool until senior year. I had wanted to keep myself seperate from people at all costs.. I would constantly check my bathroom vents and my room vent.\n\nAfter this when something bad would happen to me or my female siblings and my parents would not listen or just thought we were making things up.. my relationship with my parents is not great and I don't tell them much about what is going on in my life bc I feel like they don't care..\n\nBut don't worry. As a 23 year old. I am perfectly fine. Well, as fine as I can be. Ive held down a relationship for 5 years and not get nervous around older men.. well less nervous than before.. I still lie awake at night.. wondering what could have happened if my mom hadn't come home when she did.. or if she hadn't told my dad.. how far was John going to go that night.. my life would have changed so much.. I think to myself at times if I wasn't so gullible none of this would have happened... \n\nThank you for reading I know it was long but it's something I had to get off of my chest. I've never really told anyone other than some of my siblings and my girlfriend.. so I really appreciate you reading. I'm going to show my girlfriend this because i haven't gone into this much detail about the events that have happened because im usually a sobbing mess.. thank for the support I really do appreciate it :)", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I have been together with my husband for 19 years, married 18 years. We have 3 kids, 18 yr old, 16 yr old, 14 yr old. I also suffer from bipolar disorder. Got diagnosed about 7-8 years ago, been pretty stable on meds for about 3-4 years. He is very arrogant and stubborn. He has never hit me but emotionally I feel numb. He guilt trips me into a lot of things, he barely gets along with my family, he is controlling. He calls me dumbass and I tell him to stop and he laughs. At times I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around him. I tried talking to him yesterday about how he makes me feel and he says you\u2019re giving me attitude. Stop yelling at me. We come from a Christian background and his father is a pastor. He doesn\u2019t drink or do drugs and I like to have a glass of wine every once in awhile but I don\u2019t think because I have to think about how it makes him feel. He says he has seen too many households destroyed by alcohol. I don\u2019t have friends and I have to schedule all doctor appmt for him and the kids. I handle the money, he doesn\u2019t even log in to our bank app, he just asks me how much we have in the account. In the past two years, he had kissed me 3 times!! He makes excuses why he doesn\u2019t want to kiss me. I don\u2019t even want to be intimate with him anymore. He gets mad for the stupidest things and doesn\u2019t take blame when he is at fault. It\u2019s everyone else\u2019s fault. Today my 18 yr old son told me that he thinks his father is emotionally abusive towards me. Almost every decision has to be approved by him, even if I say yes to the kids and he says no, he has the final word. He doesn\u2019t want to go out with the family like we used to when the kids were small. I have to serve him his food when we eat dinner. When we go out to eat I order his food for him. These are some of the things he does or acts and I am basically numb. He is out of town for the weekend working and I am actually relieved that I don\u2019t have to deal with him.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

She has tried to self harm and always jokes about being \u201cworthless\u201d and that nobody cares about her. Even if they are mere jokes I know they come from a place of insecurity and doubt towards her abilities from the pressure that has been put by her parents. She also believes that everything that happened was her fault and that she is to blame for all the abuse she has been put through.\n\nRecently she told a trusted teacher of hers about the situation, the teacher is going to make her go to our school\u2019s psychologist to see what can be done, but my friend is hesitant to go and get help because she said that it was the best to keep quiet since it doesn\u2019t matter.

My friends' parents live in a town where all of us went to college. While I attended, I had an extremely emotionally manipulative shithead of a boyfriend with whom I spent a torturous 5 years (on and off). Textbook narcissist, he stretched me emotionally and financially thin with his self-absorbed demands but I was conditioned to be a selfless giver, so I acquiesced thinking that he would see all the things I did for him and reciprocate. As you might have guessed, I was sadly mistaken and was shat all over instead. I was broken for years after the relationship ended and largely blamed myself for all the how's and why's and ruminated over all the what if's. But since moving back down to my hometown and with some time I've *mostly* realized he was the shit head, not me. I have been no-contact with him for several years and it has helped me immensely. He's tried to reach out to me a few times over the years but I've curved him each time --I have no plans to talk to him ever again.\n\nIt's a pretty small college town where everyone knows everyone, and I will most definitely run into him at the local bars or restaurants somewhere.

I just don't want to fucking talk to him and pretend that since 6-7 years have passed, everything is all just water under the bridge.

Alot of it happened at a time when I was forced to live with them due to custody issues. I was routinely insulted, gaslit, and threatened with things like drugging or hospitalization. It was a really dark time for me. I still struggle with the trauma to this day, but I had generally recognized what i went through for what it was and knew it was wrong. Which is part of why I feel so stupid now.\n\nI was talking with family a while ago about my abusers and what we have had to deal with constantly thanks to them when I just brought up an incident such a sickeningly casual way.\n\n\"Yeah, one time [x] and I got into a physical fight, and she pushed me into a door and choked me.\"\n\nEveryone stopped. None of the stuff we were talking about was light-hearted, but up until that point we had been laughing some like \"haha yeah thats really crazy. They are so crazy!\" After a minute, they got mad on my behalf and asked why didn't I tell them. They would have helped me. That isn't normal, I should have told them.\n\nI don't have alot of memories from the time I lived with my abusers. Trauma blocking and all I guess. I do remember some of this incident though. I remember fighting verbally at first. Then something happened, I think I tried to grab something from her hand, she smacked me in the head with what I had reached for. It just all escalated from there, and ended when I got choked. I was so shocked when that happened. I was just saying over and over \"you choked me. You choked me.\" I briefly remember her denying it, and then blaming me and saying how I was insane, out of control, and gonna be locked up. After that, I don't know.  The last memory I have is me just laying on the first bed I could find and crying. At some point, I ended up on the phone with my therapist, who asked me if they should send somebody to come and take me someplace safe.\n\nI said no.\n\nI feel so sick with myself for saying no. I know why I did it. I was scared of where they would take me. I thought that they would lock me in a room and drug me until I was a zombie just like my abusers always promised, and that I would never be seen again. I also thought it was my fault, and, to be honest, I still kinda do. Around this time, I was having blackout panic attacks where i could unexpectedly lash out. Maybe I started the fight. If that's the case, I feel like I deserved it. I was bad and couldn't be normal, she had no choice. Even with all that though, why I didn't I tell anyone? The situation never seemed that bad to me, but if it was any other child being choked, I'd know I would be upset.\n\nI just have so many conflicting emotions about this. I don't know what I'm supposed to think. What if other incidents happened like this? Like i said, I can't remember a bunch from that time, or maybe there are other incidents where I'm just not seeing them correctly. I know of one other time she hit me, but I'm questioning that some too. I feel like I may be making a small incidents into nothing. I just feel so hurt, unsure, and gross.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

So, I am 40 now, grew up with a very strict religious Middle Eastern father and a moderate Middle Eastern mother.\n\nMy mom has a few weeks left- I am very close to her and she's the most important thing in my life.\n\nMy relationship with my dad has always been terrible. He was physically abusive toward my mother on several occasions (strikes to the body, throwing things) during the late 80s and quite a few times to myself from the late 80s to the early 90s. Also things like tearing doors off cabinets, yelling and not knowing if he was going to hurt you, etc, just lots of things that would cause constant tension and toeing the line.\n\nHe has always been emotionally abusive as well from when I was young. All my hobbies were a waste of money, my writing (I loved to write) was stupid (he'd say it outright), and my lack of religious prowess was always an issue (why don't you pray enough, etc).\n\nHe still continues to be impossible to please and a complete drain.\n\nRegardless of my opinion of him, for whatever reason, my mother decided to stay instead of leave, most likely due to cultural factors and reliance.\n\nOf course the physical abuse stopped, and my relationship is a bit better. However, I have to live a double life because he's still incredibly religious, and there is no room for argument. He's upset with me for not getting married yet and it's a constant subject so much so that it makes me just now want to be around him. I'm 40 and he still asks me \"what is your issue, are you a non-believer?\"\n\nOne of my biggest issues is that when I bring up the abuse, he'll say things like \"what do you mean?\" or \"big deal, it was just a few times.\"\n\nIn his defense, he provided to us, my parents paid for my school, they've loaned me money in tough times, etc.\n\nLast year I moved out at 39, and decided to try to make a life for myself where I rely on my own, make my own decisions free of judgement, date who I want, etc (all these things are not possible living in a traditional environment).\n\nI've also dealt with painkiller addiction as a way to numb the pain and the constant tension in my life. Living in a home where you're close to mom but can't stand dad, with the backdrop of past violence that's never acknowledged (and downplayed when it's brought up), it's just taken a toll on me.\n\nBecause of cancer, my mom has been given a few weeks. She is actually the one that pushed me to get out on my own, and break away from the mold and live my own life (there was a point where I was pretty much resigned to never moving out).\n\nToday my father asked me to move in with him once she passes. I told him I care for him, but I would need my space and that me moving in with him was not an option. As much as I care for him, I don't feel like I am obligated to put with him. He's in great shape (a mechanic, still working and active) and my sister also lives nearby.\n\nReally torn but I feel like it's a no-brainer. Any thoughts are appreciated.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I'd like to wave goodbye tomorrow then meet him there next Fri. \n\nHow could I go about this?

I can't get the fact that he fucked a 16 year old out of my head so much that it's appearing in my dreams. He said it was in a moment of weakness. He was going through his divorce. He was sad and lonely. It disgusts me. I don't care if it happened when he was 38 or 39. That's fucking disgusting.\n\nLast night I had a weird dream of being 16 again and him coming into my room and telling me how mature I am for my age and how well developed I am and in the dream I told him I am not what I will look like yet, I haven't finished becoming an adult. Fucked up dream.\n\nThis morning I woke up with a text at 9am of him telling me he can't talk, he is out to lunch with his daughter (who is 19 - I have known her since she was 14). It didn't occur to me until a bit after lunch but he had sent me that many hours before lunch, way before I had even had my morning coffee (today is a slow day thankfully so I have time to process). They live in a small village that takes 5-10min to walk everywhere.I know he did (still does?) covert incest towards his daughter after his divorce. He said she was his best friend, he told her everything and he shared everything with him and all about his divorce (about HER MOM that she still lives with and her and her brother have a great relationship with). I no longer live with him so I don't know what goes on anymore.\n\nWe are on video chat and many times he constantly teases her or they play fight and flirt and cook together in a way that is just off. It just is off. I don't know how to describe it other than it is just massively off. If I literally did not know them, I would NOT think that he was her father but her boyfriend who just looked older, which isn't too weird since me and her look the same age. When they cook together he will stand behind her and wrap his arms around her helping her cook (she is 19, not 7). Many times she playfully will slap his butt and they laugh and play fight like an adult couple would. When she was studying English grammar and asked him questions, I knew the answers, he made sure I could hear everything but I was muted to tell her his (wrong) answers about the English language. I know my English isn't perfect. She would finish her work and hug him and say \"thanks dad you're the best\". It made me mad he purposefully made her have wrong answers and bad grammar because he can't stand looking wrong towards her or he maybe he wanted to upset me. They constantly tease each other and have all these inside jokes and poke and touch each other in a way that is uncomfortable to me.\n\nI've tried to do the same things with him so many times and he always shuns me or tells me to go away or leave him alone. I've asked for help constantly with my language studies of their native language and he has told me he doesn't know and doesn't speak it well enough (then how is he helping her with the English language that I understand better but can't help me in a different language he speaks everyday!??) He refuses to cook with me, even though he always tells daughter he loves cooking. He tells me to go to the store and buy my own food if I want to make them anything. I walk to the store, come back, make food and he says he is not hungry (she doesn't eat it because she is only home maybe 6x a month at evening now or less since she lives with her boyfriend). He refuses to play fight or anything with me or tease me or be silly with me like he is with her. If I am silly with him, he yells \"STOP!\" \"LEAVE ME ALONE!\". They play tease, flirt and poke at each other all the time and it is sickening. He can only play fight, tease, flirt, play games, cook with, watch movies only with his daughter unless he is high enough, then he can be with me or his younger son.His son? He doesn't even barely pay attention to him. His son eats food in his room and stays in his room and barely ever comes out. When I lived there, his son would come out asking me for homework questions or life advice or just to talk about his day. His daughter never, ever talked to me then or now.\n\nHis daughter is only 19 so I don't think she knows or understands how wrong this might be. I can't tell her either because I am seen as the bad guy to her.  Maybe I am wrong. I don't know anymore. He tells me I am jealous, but I am not jealous for wanting a back massage from him but he gives it to his daughter. I am not jealous for when living there, wanting to know their school schedules and what is happening, but he tells his daughter the son's schedule as if it is their son and not her brother/a child I am taking care of. I am not jealous for wanting to meal plan with him but he only will do it with her and then he demands I pay for half of it because I am the adult but she is treated as his partner and I am treated as a foreign guest or child.\n\nI needed to rant. There was nothing wrong with his daughter ask him out to lunch today. This is a normal father-daughter thing. It was that the dream and then that text flooded back so many memories and made me feel so sick.

His response to my concerns was, \u201cI think your seeing a mirage.\u201d I took this at face value,  as him saying that he thinks I believe there is a problem that doesn\u2019t exist (something he has said many, many times before). As we continued our talk, he started telling me things that I can say to the therapist for him. I told him that I will not speak for him and if he\u2019d like to attend the sessions with me than he\u2019d have all the opportunity to speak for himself. I told him that I will let her know what my concerns are and that you believe I\u2019m seeing a mirage., just as you said.

He said,\u201d If you had asked me what I meant by that than you would have gotten a better understanding of what I meant. That\u2019s good communication.\u201d I said, so I am to blame because you made a statement to me that meant something very clear to me so it would not require me to ask for you to explain it but I should have known that you probably meant something completely different than what you actually said and if I\u2019d just known that than I would have asked what you really meant by it?

I\u2019ve watched him beat up his sister and pretty sure cane close to ending her life on more than one occasion. I got the lesser of physical beatings but I\u2019d trade them. He called me to the bathroom one afternoon, I thought I may have forgotten my clothes on the bathroom floor after a shower or something so prepared myself for a talking to. He closed the door behind me and I saw nothing on the floor. He was in his underwear and was \u201caroused\u201d he put the toilet seat down and sat down. I wasn\u2019t sure what was going on but felt it wasn\u2019t normal. He told me to sit in his lap and I hesitated. His voice was kind and went aggressive really quick. I got scared and complied. He touched my chest and arms and I don\u2019t remember much else but he stopped and told me to get out. I did  and I tried to act like it didn\u2019t happen. It was confusing for me.

She was a complete narcissist and it took me up until my sophomore year of college to realize it (we became best friends since freshman year of high school). We were a group of 4 girls, all best friends and all attached at the hip basically. We would do everything together and looking back, all the fun we had would also be accompanied by nonsensical fights. I could go on and on about stupid fights my ex best friend caused in those seven years of friendship but it\u2019s way too long for a reddit post. \n\nSome memorable ones were: it was my 18th birthday and my narcissistic ex-best friend orchestrated that we all celebrate my birthday by going out to a restaraunt with a group of our friends. For some reason, my narcissistic ex-best friend got into a fight with me (i still have no clue what the fight was about) and I ended up being uninvited to my birthday party. The rest of my friends ended up going to the restaurant thinking I would be there. My other best friend texted me the address (because my narcissistic ex-best friend changed which restaurant to go to so I wouldn\u2019t just show up) but I ended up showing up anyways and being awkwardly ignored throughout dinner. \n\nStupid me still remained friends with her for a couple years after that incident because I was so blind and had no clue what narcissism was at the time. Fast forward to college and it was our mutual friends 21st birthday. My narcissistic ex-best friend was going to throw a party for our mutual friend since they went to the same college and were also roommates. I wasn\u2019t able to make the party due to a family event and told my friend ( the one whose bday it was) that I wasn\u2019t able to make her bday party but would love to take her to dinner one day to celebrate. I didn\u2019t tell my narcissistic best friend that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make the party because I figured my other friend would tell her since they were roommates. Anyways fast forward to a couple days before the party I get a text from my narcissistic ex friend saying \u201cHey! Will you arrive on Friday early to help me decorate?\u201d I informed her that I wasn\u2019t able to make the party due to a family event, even though I definitely knew that she knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend, and that I thought my other friend would let her know. Anyways, I was called a bitch and an asshole for not being able to attend the party.\n\nAfter this and many other stupid fights I ended up just blocking her on instagram and haven\u2019t talked to her in over 2 years. She never contacted me after I blocked her and I never contacted her. We were put into a group chat together a few months ago where some of my high school friends wanted to have a reunion but I left the group chat because I didnt want to have conversation with her or ever see her. After I left the chat she talked shit about me to everyone else still in the group chat saying that she would be down to hang out with everyone as long as I wasn\u2019t there.\n\nLast month, she ended up friend requesting to follow me on Instagram. This was totally out of the blue and. she never texted me and we havent talked in 2 years.

He later said he wanted to call it quits because he felt like we had nothing in common and that I ruined his relationship to God by moving in with him before marriage (which he wanted).*\n\n*A lot of emotional damage later, my appetite was gone and I lost over twenty pounds in less than two weeks, he kept telling me how worthless I was and how much pain I caused him by ruining his life that I tried to commit suicide, he found me and left me there to struggle on my own, then by morning he was gone and I was super ill. I miscarried and didn't know I had been pregnant, so that has been eating me up entirely. Later on he sexually assaulted me then ran away to his parents for a month \"to find himself\". I checked the phone records to realize he'd been texting his woman from his workplace all day. She's supposedly highly religious but dating several guys at once, per what people in the office have volunteered after they noted he took off his wedding band (which he wanted to wear, I never asked him to) and asked me if we're still together, I said he dumped me and they asked if his sudden interest in the woman at the office was the reason, I said perhaps.* \n\n*He withdrew almost all the money from our joint checking account and left me with $300 for the entire month he was gone (even now he still plays around with the finances when he feels like it). I paid everything on credit because he wanted a domestic partner to handle all the household chores despite the condition of my moving up was getting to return to school and a car. He left me the car while he was gone, told me to \"do things and find some happiness\", but limited me to $300 cash and if I used that, I knew it would jeopardize the account, so everything I did went on my credit cards.*\n\n*His parents told me to find a job, to stop talking to them about what he had done, they were disappointed in me for premarital sex with him and didn't care about anything else. They were glad I miscarried. Seemed sad I survived my attempted suicide. They don't seem to realize he's still lying to them or care. It's the first time in four years I've felt completely isolated. I tried to reach out to my parents and they said I should have married him before moving, that I made my choice and they tried to warn me, so now I'm cut off.*\n\nI am struggling every day.\n\nHe tells me about his dates with her doing things I used to encourage him to do with me like eating sushi, which he hates, going for runs in the cold weather, which they both hate, and so on, when he's back in town, which he's coming back tonight and won't be leaving until he returns to our hometown for the holidays (he asked me what my plans were and I just started crying). When he's here he tries to play games like 'peek a boo' with me by putting his hands over my glasses after sneaking up on me from behind. He'll try to have pillow fights with me as I'm texting friends trying to find ways to keep myself occupied when he's here. He's hit me pretty hard in the face a few times, causing my glasses to sting my nose then he'll appear contrite about it  and try to lean on me to check out my face. He keeps trying to tickle me and nudge me, to focus on him when we're alone together, but in public he's aloof and distant. He didn't want me interacting with anyone, telling me he'll support me until I can get back on me feet, so I haven't been on social media anymore for over several months, but someone told me he still has us as engaged on FB. \n\nI'm just really struggling every day.\n\nAfter the miscarriage and assault, I went to the gynecologist and reported what happened. I was a mess. We did the usual. They got back to me later saying my results showed signs of uterine sickness leading to a type of cancer that slowly kills the uterus. He and I talked about it after he returned because I was worried about the biopsy they were going to do which was quoted to me around $300. He was apathetic about it, told me he would put money in the account and to charge it to his card. Since then I was supposed to undergo low-stress self-care practices, eat more, do some exercise, and monitor my symptoms. Well, I can tell you that low-stress thing hasn't happened.\n\nWednesday this week was my follow-up appointment at the gynecologist. I had to undergo a uterine biopsy and cervical biopsy because they suspect cancer and I was completely alone because I have no family up here and the few people I can claim as friends are out of town, but even then I feel so vulnerable lately I don't know if I would have wanted any of them holding my hand while I was screaming through the biopsies because of the pain.\n\nEvery time he comes back I go into a state of panic.

Anyway I got frustrated with feeling so alone and I remembered seeing this documentary about guys who liked fat girls and I went on Omegle and added the first guy who was into my weight on Snapchat. He was 30 years old. I was 12 and he knew I was 12. I knew this was dangerous but I didn\u2019t care. I would send him nudes every night and sometimes even during school.

Still, he strikes me as a covert narcissist these days, and you seem like people who \"get\" narcs really well, and I ask you to read through these anecdotes and deduce:\n\n* He had some *really* violent sexual fantasies that I didn't actually take part in, I just told him that stuff was hot (I have C-PTSD btw). By really violent, I mean rape, breaking bones, making me cry, stopping me if I try to flee, choking me... He wasn't hardcore in bed, but he used some violence.\n\n* He loved referring to me as his slave, or his property. He even used to tell me that those were my real names.\n\n* He said a few times that seeing bruises and other marks on my body turned him on.\n\n* Twice when we were making out, I protested because I wasn't too comfortable with other people (his brother, caf\u00e9 staff) hearing us having sex. His brother was, in fact, in the next room, and the door wasn't even entirely closed. He said his brother was wearing headphones, I said \"but still\", and he kept insisting. At the caf\u00e9, his response was \"I don't care\".\n\n* My problems were my own to deal with, and I struggled with things like abusive parents, my brother's suicide, burnout at work, lacking mental health... If he said anything, it was one or two almost generic short things. Otherwise, it was just my care about him and his problems.\n\n* (This one feels like a mixed bag, since he at least said he was severely depressed. I know depressives can become absent from relationships, out of their illness.) He had these more or less long periods where he would barely answer text messages or Skype, even when online. The longest of these was over six months of barely any contact. He kept saying that he was depressed but he'll do better, but better never came, and the apology for almost ignoring me for a little over half a year was all \"I am really ill, I don't know why I didn't text you, you deserve better\".\n\n* (Edit: He never told me about these impending periods of absense, or apologised on his own initiative. It was always me asking about it.)\n\n* He'd either cancel date after date (because he was too depressed), or just not say anything so I'd have to contact him to find out why he wasn't present. He always said he was sorry, but things didn't change much.\n\n* He would suddenly quit text conversations, and despite apologising for it at times, he didn't stop doing that.\n\n* When I fled my narc mother's apartment and moved out, and texted him in all my excitement, his response was \"congratulations sweetie\". He then repeated that after answering my question about how he was doing, and I told him I was finally free.\n\n* He told me that I would be granted the privilige to kiss him (that was the gist of it, at least, I'm translating from Swedish). He also casually said he had strong arms once, and another time, he offered to let me watch him work out.\n\n* He said I was the reason he didn't end his life, and that I was his drug.\n\n* We talked about stuff like marriage and kids (we were not even 21 years old). He once wondered not how our kids would look like, but how *beautiful* they would be.\n\n* He never gave me any birthday or Christmas presents. Except one year, where I got satisfying him sexually for Christmas. He also promised to buy me a leach to drag me around with on all fours with.\n\n* He didn't seem all that interested in me as a personality. For one, my conversion to Catholicism was only met with any questions because I had encouraged him to ask freely. Even then, it was just him asking me if and then why I believe in God, and stating that God can't be scientifically proven so he can't believe. \"I'm just a man of the scientific principle.\"\n\n* His reaction to my not wanting to have any more sex outside of marriage was that he could abstain from sex, but that he didn't get any choice in this decision of mine.\n\n* He'd ask me these questions like \"what are you like in our relationship\" and \"what makes you feel submissive\".\n\n* He once said he \"always feels like he's on top of me\". That could have been a weird sex thing. It was in that context, and he liked being a \"good Dom\" as he put it about himself.\n\n* We ended up breaking up twice. The first time, he said I was \"smart, but not that smart\".\n\n* He loved exhibitionism, so he could show me off.\n\nI feel like I just answered my own question, and it seems it's a yes; he seems narc-y. On the other hand, there are a lot of symptoms and traits I can't honestly apply to him, so I wonder if he was just a douche? What was he, do you think?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I knew his proclamations of love were baseless when he said he would do anything to keep me; and, of course, not followed up by any plan. His words were empty. This guy made me homeless and instead of \u2018doing anything\u2019 to get me back, hadn\u2019t made any gesture of moving me back in. He doesn\u2019t care. In fact, he got is cake and ate it, too.

I know it but I also know it\u2019ll be better when it's over. And it better be soon. I know he\u2019ll fuck me up. Again. And I'll never see it coming. \n\nI know how evil he can be.

I can barely face myself for betraying them (though they don't know.) That's enough to let this go.

Drug addled relatives fighting over the stimulants. Gang warfare breaking out on the grounds.\n\nThis was a perfect place to abandon a child.\n\n*\"Oh son, don't you know that America comes first? You have to suffer so I can serve in the National Guard since I decided to not re-enlist in the Air Force.

I deserved to be with drug-addled family members because \"they have kids so they're cool.\"\n\nDid I forget to mention this woman gave birth to me and decided that not being a mother was far more important? \n\nGoddesses bless America.\n\nSo, after the fact that I brought up my concerns, as a well-conditioned and normal seven-year-old would when they are addressing an adult like a GD therapist, my womb donor decided it would be best to have me go to the diddler's home because...

I told him I was a virgin and he was extremely excited upon finding that out.. I realize now that his reaction was very creepy but at the time I was flattered that I \"had something\" he wanted. In the very beginning of our relationship he did take advantage of me when I was entirely too drunk to do anything about it and I could hardly remember anything. He told me the day after that I liked it and not to worry about it.\n\nHe had drug and alcohol problems and he would get really fucked up all the time. There were several times when he had passed out somewhere like on the couch and when I would gently wake him up, he would get up and come after me really aggressively and throw a fist or try to back hand me. He didn't ever hit me because I was able to move myself out of the way but he came very close each time. I started to avoid him when I noticed him getting too messed up to avoid potentially being hit.\n\nHe would say mean/hurtful things to me often. Examples are joking about cheating on me, he told me I was only cute when I was naked, and one time he made a crude joke in a room full of people about me \"fucking a bunch of guys\"\n\nHe broke up with me a couple times because he was frustrated I would not have sex with him so he could hookup with other willing girls. He would then come back and he'd give me some emotional story to make me feel guilty and say all kinds of sweet things to make me want to get back together and I was always stupid enough to fall for that.\n\nWe did LSD together one night, it was my first time taking a psychadelic, and he had made a move on me and wanted to have sex. I wasn't expecting at all to do anything sexual and told him no several times. He proceeded to berate me, tell me I was a shitty girlfriend, I'm supposed to trust him, I've made him wait long enough. We argued back and forth briefly and I felt confused and guilty because of his reaction so I told him that it was fine and I was ready. He immediately changed his tune and wasn't angry anymore and he asked if I was sure and I said yes. We had sex and I just held back tears the rest of the night.\n\nI ended up finally leaving him much later after finding out he actually was cheating on me. He also got an STD that he never told me about and I only found out about it because I found the paperwork from his Dr and I thankfully never got it.\n\nI was young and just sooo naive that it's hard for me to believe I ever allowed any of that to happen. I've pretty much just suppressed all of this and have never told anyone the full story. I've never considered what he did to be abusive but I don't know what else to call it or what to make of it.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

TL; DR: I think my nex allowed me to mediate a decent enough (if still not entirely equitable) marital settlement assuming that it would enable him to keep me on the shelf.  I\u2019m curious to know if and how other people have experienced anything similar. \n\nWhen my nex and I legally separated, our official plan was to split the financial assets but to continue to live together, because we wanted to try to make the relationship \u201cwork\u201d in some way. The idea was that if we were \u2018financially independent\u201d from each other, we wouldn\u2019t fight about money, and our relationship would improve (yes, it\u2019s crazy, but that\u2019s life with a covert narc). The marital settlement allowed my nex to buy the home we\u2019d been renting, and within a month of the separation being finalized, my nex decided couldn\u2019t figure out \u201cwhat he wanted from life\u201c unless he lived by himself. \n\nHeartbroken, I asked if he wanted this to be a temporary separation, living apart while we worked on the relationship, or something more permanent. He said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be sure\u201d what he wanted. So I moved out of what  had been our home for 15 years - a house I really loved - deeply grieving, but determined to \u201cremain friends\u201d with my nex.\n\nA year and a half later, we\u2019d been hanging out maybe once a month texting about random stuff a few times a week. We never tried to process the relationship or talk about anything deep, but we did occasionally joke about the fun stuff we were doing on our own that we hadn\u2019t been able to do together - my nex could cook with meat, now that he didn\u2019t live with a vegetarian; I could furnish my home with vintage thrift store treasures in bright colors, which my nex would have hated. We were getting along better than we had in years. I thought I\u2019d lost a husband but gained a friend, that our relationship hadn\u2019t ended so much as changed, and I figured it was time to finalize the divorce.\n\nSo, I brought this up to my nex, and much to my shock, he seemed ... shocked that I was suggesting such thing.\n\nSuddenly, according to him, the problems that had led to us living separately \u201cdidn\u2019t seem insurmountable\u201d. He claimed that he\u2019d assumed that living separately \u201cwasn\u2019t a forever thing\u201d. Taken aback, I asked him if he thought I would keep myself on the shelf indefinitely, until such time as he invited me to move back into the home he owned as ... what, his tenant? His FWB? He paused for a moment, and said, \u201c... Well, *obviously*, you\u2019d have a say in that...\u201d \n\nI felt like he had to really search for that answer, as if he was guessing at the correct response to my question, and he delivered it as if it had never before occurred to him that I could possibly have another ambition in life besides waiting around for him to decide whether or not he wanted me. \n\nAnd that, friends, was when I first began to realize that he and I inhabited very different realities. \n\nI mean, none of that is normal right? I feel insane just typing it out, and yet I\u2019m second-guessing myself, as if any of his assumptions were reasonable... and I feel like, if he\u2019d had any inkling that I meant to make a permanent break with him, that he\u2019d have tried to screw me in the divorce. Anyway, does anyone else have a similar experience with \u201cshelving\u201d? How did your narc/nex react when they realized you weren\u2019t going to devote your life to awaiting their pleasure? \n\nthanks for reading, I hope that wasn\u2019t too confusing ...", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I once got drunk and told a friend about a few things but I regretted it and told her to forget it.\n\nI always knew if I ever had a boyfriend I need one who I could tell this. While my boyfriend is the most loving and understanding person I know I just don't feel ready to talk about this. However, I pushed this thing away for my entire life. I need to tell him. I am sure he will show me nothing but love but I simply can't manage the fact that I put this emotional burden on someone I love. I also don't know how the relationship between him and my father will change (not that I care about that too much). And also, I don't want to be the \"abused one\" in his mind.\n\nI should also include what actually happened. I will try to keep it short. Please keep in mind that while my father never physically abused me, the emotional abuse still left a huge scar. The earliest memory of my father is when he was drunk, destroyed the kitchen and screamed at me. This was basically my whole childhood. Parents fought. Father got drunk and screamed at me. I cried. And all the time when there was a break of this emotional abuse (like 2 months) I was so happy and thought it was all over until it started again. THIS is the basic memory of my childhood. An abuse that is never over. Oh, and because I remember right now, just to show you an example, one new years eve my sister had friends over and he went into her room, destroyed one of her cupboards, threw it out of the window and screamed at all of them. They were scared, cried and ran home. Not only embarrassing but the fact that he acted like that to kids he didn't know...\n\nMy parents wanted to divorce several times, but due to whatever reason, they are still together. I should clarify that I still live with them. As a kid, I wanted nothing but their divorce. Things went on from when I was 6 to about 16. During these years I learned to hate my father from the bottom of my heart. I can barely look him in the eyes and it makes living very complicated. My mother acts like nothing ever happened. I barely ever talk to my father. While he has not been like that for about 1 year, my basic childhood memories and thoughts can never be changed. He never apologized (I seriously think he forgot most due to being drunk). Also, I can never trust him, that there is not one day he will simply snap. \n\nBack to topic: How do I tell anyone about this? How did you people come out to anyone? \n\nI told my boyfriend that there are a few things about me that no one knows. Important things. So, Christmas is coming up and my parents (the happy family) want to invite my boyfriend over. During Christmas or new years eve, my father would ALWAYS be drunk and always be abusive. I don't know what to do. It's pretty complicated.\n\nSo, do you people have any advice for me? I seriously don't know what to do. I'm also bad at writing down what happened/my emotions back then and now. \n\nThank You", "subreddit": "abuse"}

There is so much at stake and I keep thinking that if he would just get help in this area (acknowledging my feelings and breaking the unhealthy pattern he has when I express myself- gaslighting/DARVO) that things would be so much healthier and I would finally feel like my feelings matter. \n\nI\u2019m not making excuses for him but I am trying to be fair and recognize that he may be lower on the spectrum than many pervasive, diabolical narcs who absolutely require no contact (I know a couple of them myself). My husband\u2019s mother is one of those very covert, manipulative types and she has taught him firsthand how to behave in an argument (DARVO). I keep thinking that if my husband could recognize this is a toxic approach in any relationship and to be open to learning a new way of communicating his feelings to me and responding to mine, it would give us a fighting chance. \n\nHow much of this sounds like delusion and denial and wishful thinking? Like I said, there is so much at stake here. If I allow myself to accept that he will never change, then I must face the absolute reality that I will be divorcing him at some point. If I hold out hope that he can change, and give him the chance to, then I can prolong the crushing weight of guilt that I know I will feel when I end my marriage and dissolve my family.

He would subtly jab at me with jokes and disregard my emotions constantly, take advantage of my insecurity and my naiveness, stonewall me till breaking me, and the biggest sin I will never forgive nex for: sexually assaulting me. \n\nAfter his final cycle of hooking me then stonewalling me, I had enough. His cycles of love bombing and discard were getting shorter every time and this time around was when he truly broke me. I pissed him off by not acting like a doormat when he abruptly canceled time spent together without ever telling me. He had this nasty habit of going silent and then accusing me of being controlling when I asked if he could at least let me know that he needed to go and do something else. I didn't mind him having his own life, but after suffering through stonewalling and him acting cold when I wouldn't play along to his whims, every withdraw he had made me nervous. He would push me often to the point of breaking me and when I would react emotionally hurt, he would make me out as an irrational witch. My emotions are strong, I know this all too well. But after being with my current and healthier partner and experiencing an actual healthy relationship,  I realized that I dont outburst at all unless severely provoked. Nex seemed like he enjoyed poking me till I exploded and then playing the calm, sensible boy who is the only sane person around to \"tame\" me. \n\nFinal discard was pretty eminent. I'm pretty sure it already happened as he spent days ignoring me or giving me bread crumbs. When given bread crumbs, I would try to talk to him, but he would once again go cold until noticing I was also pulling away. I generally had enough and pulled away, acting cold until blocking him all together. I never said goodbye or explained myself, but generally ignored him and his attempts at weak hoovering via FB messages about things he knew I liked. After everything was over, I was lost and abysmal in mood. I was crushed and beaten down to pieces. I wanted to end myself because I thought he took my value away and that the abuse was my fault; That I asked for it and completely earned it. I had a rough time and needed support, so I went to our shared friend group. \n\nI knew he was part of our community, too, that he saw them as \"friends \" even though they already severely disliked him for his arrogance and condescending behavior. But I still held him in high regard, so when I began venting my severe depression over the abuse I suffered through, I changed the gender of Nex and the name to protect his identity; Nex became a female best friend who messed with me now. I tried being as unbiased as possible, sharing EVERYTHING that happened: the abuse and my reactions. I painted myself as the villain who pushed a good man into becoming an abuser. I blamed myself for all that. But all this rang familiar to them and they eventually figured out that this fake person I spoke about was none other than Nex. A year later or so, they kicked him out of our group after I brought up to them that his presence was triggering to me due to him sexually assaulting me back then; up until then, I didn't even know that the sexual assault that took place was actually sexual assault: I figured it was just him being impatient and wanting me despite me saying No over and over again. I only had one small log of messages from him to prove he assaulted me (he bragged to me about it), so it took a while for them to review everything and make the decision. Of course, he played it off as him not caring once he was told he had to go. I'm sure he didn't quite care about me anymore and I'm glad he doesn't. Do I feel bad about telling them all the shit he has done to me? No. It needed to be said.\n\nI found a letter of his around the time he was kicked out, dated a year ago, about him explaining why he abused me. No, he didn't actually say abuse or even acknowledge that he directly did such things, but generally said all this abuse was my fault and my actions pushed him to do it. Keep in mind that even when I acted exactly the way he wanted (a quiet doormat), he would still grow cold and discard me. I was mad at this. Then I kept reading:\n\nHe said that there are two sides to a relationship and that people needed to hear HIS side of the story. And since the narrative was controlled by me because I spoke up about the abuse first, that I was just \"playing the victim\" and being a hypocrite. He claimed that my \"outbursts of irrationality\"(aka my emotional reactions to being pushed so far by his actions for years and years) caused him to never break up with me and to string me along knowing that the relationship had no future. \n\nSorry for the long post, but this has been on my mind on and off for a long time. I won't deny that I was the victim 100%: he and I were both toxic, but I was merely reacting to his sick shit rather than being irrational due to malicious intent. \n\nSo, was I the narcissist due to smearing his name via exposure? \n\ntl;dr: I told nex and I's friend group about the abuse he put me through. I used a fake name for nex but they still figured out it was him and he was cast out of the group. Was I the narcissist the entire time for smear campaigning him?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Denied the entire relationship. \n\nHe blocked and deleted me on social media and just as I started to feel like I was finally free of the trauma bond, a friend told me about his profile pic: couples Halloween costume with his new supply. Sadly at this point I was still unable to admit that he's a narcissist because I was so ashamed that I'd gotten mixed up with yet another toxic person. He was seeing her at the same time he was telling me he was ready to start a family with me. \n\nI reached out to his new supply and let her know about the overlap. Very out of character for me, but I'll admit I was seething and nothing was going to stop me. She really surprised me and told me she believed me and what I was saying was lining up with what she was starting to see in his behavior. We messaged for hours and ultimately learned that he was actively trying to get us both pregnant at the same time. That was the moment the fog finally lifted for me.... he's not just some two-timing jerk. He's an expert at excuses and she's already developed a trauma bond so I doubt this is the end for them, but I told her to follow her gut about red flags because I sure wish I did. \n\nThe terror set in pretty quickly. I told her I was uneasy about his rages and she said, \"yeah, he's pretty upset.\" She did NOT say \"Oh he would never do anything to hurt anyone. Don't worry.\" She knows. She's seen his rages. He never got physically violent with me but if I'm honest I believe that eventually he would have. He has a history of assault which he explained away as being young and dumb and drunk at a bar. I've since learned of multiple assaults and DUIs. Within 24 hours I got a text from him: how dare I embarrass the love of his life and leave us alone... etc etc. Embarrass? Huh? I blocked his number and gave no reply.\n\nA few more hours went by and I noticed a bunch of obviously fake accounts of good looking guys with dogs (eye roll) requesting to follow me on IG.

I can say that there were red flags in the beginning but I was so incredibly head over heels that I ignored them. Fast forward to about 2 years ago and he had begun getting panic attacks so was put on a very low dose of anxiety medicine. About that time is when things went downhill. The sly insults disguised as compliments, the \"joking\" comments about how wasn't obedient enough (which he very well knew the day he met me lol), the dinners that were excellent but always had one tiny little comment on (\"it's really good babe but maybe you could've added this or this\"). Yes, we had some big fights and I was always left feeling confused as to what the hell just happened. When he gets angry he goes right for the jugular and says some of the most awful stuff I've ever heard.\n\nThis time last year I had a really great job and he got me fired. I have never been fired in my life, if anything I always had great relationships with my employers. But ok, I've talked about returning to school for a long time now so I did just that. Worked my butt off, was very proud of myself that my first class back after so many years I aced. He looked at me and said \"you think you're successful after one class? You haven't finished.\". That begins my year of hell. The abusive language got worse and he became weirdly perverted. I can't believe I'm even repeating this but ya'll gotta understand the depth. \"Why don't you let me fuck you in the butt so you bleed and whimper?\". OMG. Over and over I heard this. He doesn't like when I have homework, I could be sitting doing work and he tells me to get up and get him something. So I started taking notes this summer because I thought I was losing it. He got progressively more aggressive and threatens we are done. So many incidents. \n\nLast straw was 2 weeks ago.....7am and I was sitting doing homework. He goes into the kitchen and asks if the dishwasher is clean cause there were dishes in the sink. I replied yes. No biggie, I'd get to them later. He left for the store and comes back and lays into me about these dishes.....then as we all know, he has a whole list of shit I don't do right or why I'm a fucked up person. He leaves and starts texting me that we are done and he wants me out. I have no job. He comes back later and yells some more then smiles and says \"I only used you for sex.\" Damn. Wow. I walked away. He now stays at his moms on the weekends and comes home after work and sleeps on the couch. I don't understand why he doesn't just go there until I can find a way to leave. Just to torment me? We haven't spoken one word in 2 weeks. I am so deflated, sad etc. We both have kids that aren't here every day but I feel so bad for mine.

I learned that I am not crazy, and I am not paranoid, and I am not a psycho. \n\nToday I am going to talk about something that many people do not talk about. First, I would like to point out that this is not for sympathy or attention. I feel like too many people are ashamed to talk about this topic, and I am hoping I can break this barrier today. \n\nOn Thursday, November 14th, 2019, I was domestically assaulted. \n\nI will not go into details on the actual assault. I want to focus more on how I became the strongest women I can be from this, and the story behind mental manipulation. \n\nThe summer of 2018 is a summer I will never forget. That was the summer where I considered myself the highest in my life. I was doing my own art business, I was going to apprentice for tattooing, I was getting a new job at PNC. I was so happy so confident in life, I was doing so much for myself. I had so many friends to hang out with, so many people who cared for me, I was just a happy ordinary 25-year-old woman. \n\nI extremely miss myself in 2018. \n\nI met this guy (I will not mention names for privacy reasons). At first, I thought he was a wonderful guy. He was really funny, charming, charismatic, caring, almost everything a girl would really want right? \n\nWell then, alcoholism came. This person was addicted to alcohol. At first, I thought I could be helpful. I thought \"as long as he gets support, he will quit.\" \u201cI could change him, right? Enough love and support will help him.\u201d \n\nThis \u201csupport\u201d meant me becoming less and less of a human. More and more I became this girl who was starting to not see her value anymore. This \u201ccharming, charismatic, caring\u201d guy turned into \u201cyou stupid bitch why did you come\u2026\u201d \u201cyou better know you are not worthy of my company\u2026\u201d \u201cyou are quite funny to think that I care about you at all\u2026\u201d kind of guy. \n\n\u201cDo not worry\u2026\u201d I told myself, \u201cIt is the alcohol talking.\u201d\n\nThere were good times, there were bad times. If I was to describe it like a graph, each \u201cgood\u201d time became less and less, and each bad time become worse and worse. Each \u201cgood\u201d time was to ensure that somehow it was worth staying around to help him, and not actually \u201creal.\u201d\n\nEvery argument that he had gotten into, it was MY fault. Every time I was being yelled at, it was because I did something wrong. I was the instigator, I was the paranoid girl, I was crazy, I was manipulative. \n\nWhat is sad is that I started to believe it. \n\nI became, extremely depressed, lost +30 pounds. I would eat maybe once in every two days. I cried every day. \n\n\u201cAm I going crazy?\u201d\n\n\"No, that text he sent to that other girl was nothing, he said it was an old text he showed me.\"\n\n\"It is your fault you're arguing with him again, he messaged other girls and you caught him. It is your fault because you are so paranoid to have even wanting to catch him.\"\n\n\"You are crazy, you are an idiot, you are paranoid.\"\n\n\"You are a dumb bitch...\"\n\n\"You will never learn, you are always stupid.\"\n\n\u201cYou are paranoid...\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are dumb.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are stupid.\u201d\n\nI believed this!\n\nEvery argument I had with this guy, was because I was coming to my senses and realizing what was happening. Somehow though every argument he was able to convince me it was my fault and I was being delusional and coming up with crazy stories. \n\nWhile the assault was happening, he had told me that he was going to message his ex and beg for her back. This triggered me to reach out to her and warn him about him. I knew she was younger than me, and I thought maybe she was too young to see what type of guy he was.  \n\nI messaged her.\n\nDay 1:\n\nNothing.\n\nDay 2:\n\nNothing.\n\nDay 3\u201d\n\nNothi\u2026\u2026 \u201cOmg\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease Message as soon as you can\u2026\u201d \n\nI cried a lot today. I cried because I found out I am not crazy. I found out I am not a dumb bitch. I found out he had been lying to me this whole time. I found out that I am a normal woman and that all my red flags that were going off were legit. They were not just paranoia, they were not you \"second guessing yourself or being dumb...\" you were being NORMAL. \n\nHow did I get so far to the point where I found my own insanity is not worth it anymore? How could someone, belittle a woman for so long to make her feel like she is worthless and crazy?\n\nHow can someone be so cruel to a woman like that. \n\nI miss having a happy relationship. I almost got away from him with a good more respectful man someone who I had been with before. Somehow though, this manipulation had taken over so much that he was able to convince me I did not deserve this man. That because of our rocky past and what I did, I did not deserve him anymore?\n\n\u201cI do not deserve a \u2018goodmorning beautiful\u2026\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not deserve to feel smart?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not deserve to have someone give the moon and back for me?\u201d\n\nNo\u2026.\n\nI miss the good respectful man. I truly do love him. I am so sorry for giving up on us. \n\nToday I learned that I am not crazy. Today I learned that I am amazing. Today I learned that all those red flags were true, and my body is one amazing machine. Today I learned that I am smart. Today I learned I am beautiful. \n\nI will never not listen to myself again.

I knew I was giving a reaction, but at the time I felt the benefit to me was more important. It was important, and I'm still glad I did it. But I unwittingly reacted to something else at the time, and he took that and ran with it yesterday, doing everything he could to get the strongest reaction possible. It worked. I didn't realize it until after, now I see my mistakes, and I am fully committing to grey rock now that I've vented a lot of pent up anger and feel able to do it, and now that I've experienced the anger and confusion I left all over again.\n\n\nFull Story:\n\n\nI left the narc 8 weeks ago. It took me so long to see the gaslighting, the abuse, and that every word out of his mouth was a lie. After 6 years of conditioning and horrible abuse, I left 2 months after my eyes were opened. During those 2 months (and after), once I finally saw him for the POS he is, I was compelled to call out the lie du jour, stand firm and not let him change the subject, and watch him try to squirm out of it. He was awful at lying when he was called out on the spot and not able to gaslight and deflect away from it. Because I was so angry I got satisfaction from making *him* uncomfortable for once.   \n\n\n\nThe second weekend my child went to visit nEx, he brought new supply to the exchange. I asked him about who was with him, and he immediately lied, then spat out that it wasn't in the parenting plan that he had to tell me. I called him out for looking for loopholes in the plan and for cheating on me... in front of her. I knew he had lied to her about it. He whispered his argument, obviously not wanting her to hear it. That gave me satisfaction, bc again he was uncomfortable, and I was directing my anger at the person who deserved it. He was clearly wishing he wasn't in public so he could fully gaslight me and shut me up, and I was reassured that no matter what else he could do, he couldn't do that to me anymore. Which I needed. \n\n\n\nThen I noted in the parenting app some specific things that I felt needed documenting about my child when he came home from that weekend, things nEx claimed to have done and things he obviously did not do. It was 3 things. He came in and wrote a book about all of them, all lies. I simply reiterated what I previously stated (ignoring his excuses), and gave him instructions for this weekend because my child is sick. It was very dry and matter-of-fact. He's tried to get a reaction out of me by using my child this and a few other times, but I've been good (afaik) about not giving one. I assume this was still part of his \"test\" though.\n\n\n\nThat response's lack of emotion coupled with the previous weekends emotional reaction in person, helped him narrow down exactly what would push my buttons. Yesterday my child was being dropped off with nEx for the 3rd time. nEx breaks the boundary of personal contact, texting me instead of using the app. He also mentions something at exactly the last minute before he leaves to go to the drop-off place, and it isn't important in the least, but it's an obvious lie. Since it was last minute, he provoked me into reacting without thinking. I was focused on calling out the lie, even though it didn't matter. I was angry that he texted me, and I explicitly told him not to ever do it again (and blocked the number). But he still roped me into a back and forth. I didn't budge or let him change the subject, and he squirmed and changed excuses and deflected and played victim... but it was still a back and forth. The only positive thing is that it feels good to have some of the more severe crazy in screenshots now. And I stayed in the car for the actual child exchange, I didn't want to give him any more reactions. I just stared at the phone and didn't look up. Which caused him to whine and trip over himself trying to play the confused victim with my mom, and she is having none of it.\n\n\n\nSo I kept thinking about this whole thing. And I realized a few hours after what *actually* happened. He had intentionally created a lie, then forced a stronger reaction by bringing it up at the last minute and making me feel like I *had* to respond (even though now I see I didn't have to at all). I reacted to him bringing the new supply. I knew I was giving him that reaction, but at the time I saw it as worthwhile to expose his gaslighting and lies to the new supply one time and also show myself I could speak my mind and he couldn't corner me and abuse me like he wanted to in public. But that unknowingly opened a door. He couldn't very well surprise me with his new supply again. But he noticed I *also* reacted to the loophole thing and planned a way to build on that. So the next chance he got, he lied about something similar (also relating it to the new supply now that I think about it, so I guess he tried a mash-up of both which I didn't notice til rereading this), knowing I would spot it as a lie and want to call it out, even though it was insignificant. He made it more provoking by texting to my personal number instead of using the app, to immediately anger me and virtually guarantee a response. Even if I had ignored the lie, I \"had\" to respond to him contacting me like that, and in response he could have doubled down on the lie or tried a different one. It worked. \n\n\n\nThat will be the last time. I *know* he won't be able to resist doing it again, probably at the very next exchange. (I also want to say I also realized while rereading this how pathetic it is that he will keep trying indefinitely, even trying harder and harder at first, bc he is so desperate for my reaction. What a pitiful existence. That makes me feel better about this whole thing too.)  But now I see it for what it is. I won't react. He's going to have to start all over again, and hopefully I won't fall for the next thing that actually gets under my skin. Because I'm sure there will be a next thing. He extracted every ounce of information he could from me about my life and my thoughts and feelings and spent years manipulating them into the reactions he desired. I am not perfect. But I am glad I got a good amount of his craziness documented in writing if nothing else, and I am glad I realized what was happening before I spent more emotional energy on it. I'm disappointed in myself, but I'm learning. That's all I can do. It feels good to work at *not* beating myself up over it and recognizing that it's okay I screwed up, and it especially feels good to know I won't have to endure being perpetually punished for it. He is very good at manipulation, but I've recognized it, am processing it, and will contimue to move forward. He will never move forward or move on. I can and will.\n\n\n\nSo my plan to protect myself from this happening again is this: I've decided to document everything crazy, plus any child or parenting plan issues (like sending my child home with a severe diaper rash without mentioning it) somewhere other than the parenting app, so I don't give him any opening whatsoever for extra communication. I was giving him that opening before, and while I avoided reacting to his lies about it, I also don't think he needs to be aware of everything I'm documenting or he could start purposely abusing my child to see me expend the energy to document it. I have a private online journal that records date and time stamps, so I will document there so I have it if I ever need it. \n\n\n\nI am reading up on grey rocking, so I know exactly how to do it and everything it's about, and I am going to share that with my mom, since she is handing the child off now and is being subjected to his whining and gaslighting. I knew *about* it before, but I didn't read about it or seek info on it. I will continue staying in the car and staring at my phone. And I will evaluate any communication from him with \"does this *need* a response at all?\" If it doesn't, he won't get one, and if it does, I will answer with the shortest single sentence I can (including \"No.\"). And I will wait as long as possible before sending any response at all.\n\n\n\nBy coming here and admitting my mistake and what I am doing to change it, it helps me avoid beating myself up over it and ruminating. I get it out of my mind and into the world. It makes me feel like I have a clear plan of action that others (even strangers!) know and can support me in, and others can also share advice and tips for. I learned more about his methods, more about my weaknesses and what I need to work on, and how to protect myself and my family even better going forward. That feels very good and I'm proud of myself for it. \n\n\n\n*And any tips on grey rocking are appreciated!*", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I normally just float around/ lurk on Reddit, I tend to be too shy to ever post..\nPreliminary/ obligatory apologies for weird format, I only Reddit on mobile...\nAnd...Trigger warnings? I'm new to this, so I'm not sure what to specifically warn against, maybe stalking? Some mentions of cheating and mostly emotional abuse (if it's even abuse, I find myself always questioning it) \nWithout further adue....\nI had an abusive childhood, I graduated high school and haven't spoken to my mother longer than three hours in nearly 7 years.\nI went into a bad highschool relationship, and the gist of that is...let's refer to him as stripes, stripes cheated a lot, and what finally made me snap out of that relationship is he broke a mirror in a fit of rage.\nIn my state of low self esteem I started a relationship with ..let's stick with a theme and call him polka dots.\nPolka dots was enamored with me. Especially in highschool. if you have ever listened to the saga of Denko, it was very similar . Things like...I would tell him I would be going into the library for a few hours and that my phone will be off, I would come back to 75-100 messages within 2-3 hours.\nWhen I refused to date him highschool, he made my life a living hell of bullying. Real classic Neck beard shit. Spreading around rumors I that I was a slut/slag for not dating him. Got me completely ostrichzied from my original group of friends. Even got his friends...for lack of a better word spy on me. Doing things like taking candid photos of me at lunch, walking out of school, walking between school. Reporting to Polka dots what I was doing, who I was with, what I was saying...\nI finally cut off all ties, I blocked him on every social media, and since he was a grade above me he graduated away. My life finally regained some normalcy.\nFast forward a year, I get a random Facebook friend request. It's a name I don't recognize, but because of my job and my social standing in college (involved in a lot of extracurriculars and what not) I was inclined to accept it. It was Polka dots using a psedynum. He gained my trust by becoming a shit posting internet friend, and then reveling his true identity at a college event. (We both attended the same college) \nA year past I finally dropped highschool boyfriend , stripes ( we started in highschool,ended early college) \nAnd in my low self esteem from being cheated on, I told myself that if Polka dots wanted me so badly, has always wanted me so badly, then I should give him a shot. After all, he seemed like a nice guy. I told myself he grew out of the highschool harrasment. I didn't want to be cheated on again.\nIt was two grueling years of emotional neglect. It's a lot of details ,that I will spare you all of ,but two big noteworthy events is A) I almost died because of a medical condition complication, and he got mad at me for interrupting his video game time B ) his older brother was being a peeping Tom on us and he got mad at me for making a fuss about it, for upsetting his brother for being upset he was peeping. There's a plethora more, but it neither here nor there. But in essence, I lived with him,but I was alone. He made me do the grunt work , emotionally and household wise. Towards the end I ended up saying a lot \"your computer is your real girlfriend\" and \"you used to say you wanted me so bad and this is how you're treating me...?\"\nEven in our last fight, he cut me off saying \"I don't even care what you are saying, I just want to fuck you\"\nI'm not faultless....I feel bad everyday for how I reacted sometimes. I would shut down, or cry , or say inflammatory things desperately trying to get him to snap out of it (Things like \"you always choose your games over me\" which he claimed was abusive, and I won't take that away from him) \nWhen I got into a new relationship, he freaked out. Badly. 100+ text in a span of a couple hours again. He would not rest until I contacted him.\nHis text were calling me a whore,abusive, telling me I'm a monster for dating someone else. Demanding to know who I was dating...\nI eventually allowed him to call me and talk to me over the phone.\nHis tone immediately changed. He was crying, telling me how sorry he was. How much he wanted another chance. How he desperately needed to see me again. How he got an engagement ring for me and never had the chance to propose. That I wasn't abusive, he just said that because he was upset...\nThe call ended on a good (?) Note...\nI told him we turned toxic for each other, I told him I would not be his friend, no matter how much he wanted , because I told him it wouldn't be healthy for him, and that ended that .\nFast forward a year and a half. I get a message from stripes out of the blue. We didn't end in the best of terms ( as highschool relationships rarely do) but he told me that he still respected me, and was worried for me. \nHe showed me screenshots  of messages from a \"James doe\" asking about my name directly . Claiming he was doing interviews for the Interest of my current boyfriend (the same one I started dating that made polka dots flip)  and saying he was gathering evidence of my cruelty to save my current boyfriend. Stripes told him to kick rocks basically  and then told me right away. \nA quick search actually pulled up it was Polka dots psedynum account from way back when, with a name change. My boyfriend tried reaching out to him, to have Polka dots say his peace, polka dots told my boyfriend to eat shit and he was a piece of shit for dating me.\nI immediately filed a cease and desist order...and I want to believe it worked.\nIt's been 6 months and I haven't heard anything, but I still live in fear of retaliation. I have nightmares Everytime I sleep. Either childhood or Polka dot related. I live in constant anxiety of retaliation or running into him. I just don't understand why...why after a year and a half after we broke up,in what I thought was a somewhat ...okay.. breakup, would he start that crusade?

I never left my room because I was scared of seeing them, so one month of depression turned to two. I asked them to stop being so aggressive. All four of them just ended up calling me weak, fragile because of it. I told them I've never had problems like this with a household of roommates and they called me a liar, and said my friends weren't really my friends. They tracked my every move, if I left my room they knew and if something was amiss in the house theyd blame me. They broke into my room so I had to install locks. \n\nI've moved out and they still text me to blame me for their problems like things missing. I wake up afraid that I'm back in that house.

I have been with my narc husband for 6 years - I have a child from a previous relationship who also lives with us and he is 11.\n\nI don\u2019t have many friends or support network as I\u2019m living far from home and I have lurked on this sub for a long time but now I would love to know some opinions on if it is me, or if there is anything I can do to make him less angry at me or make my life easier. Leaving is my long term plan but I am trying to put money aside for that but I\u2019m still at least months away. \n\nI keep a list on my phone of things he has said and done as otherwise he denies them and makes me feel like I\u2019m going crazy - he just pretends they never happened and says \u201cwhat are you talking about\u201d\n\nHe refuses to share finances, he makes so much money but he says that is his money and so we have to split all expenses 50/50 - this is fine I work part time while my son is at school but my income is still very low. By the time I pay half of power, rent to him (he owns the house), internet and then I have maybe $100 left to go grocery shopping and he will come and choose many expensive items - making the total almost $500 as he can afford it but he knows I cannot so he makes me put my half on credit cards which are now maxed out. \n\nBecause he owns the house he expects I maintain very high cleaning standards and I do try, I work 30 hours a week and have my child\u2019s activities after school but the house is always clean and dinner is always on the table when he gets home but he always does an inspection when he walks in the door, an example is he checks how I have loaded the dishwasher as I do it incorrectly and then he pulls it all out and makes me stack it again because he says I am lazy. He also complains about the food I make and never seems to enjoy it,\n\nHe is always angry, never in the wrong. Even when he is quite obviously wrong he literally cannot see it. Example he parked his car in a bus stop and when the bus driver asked him to move he screamed at him to \u201cget a real job\u201d and was so offended that this guy had asked him to move his car. He could not grasp the concept that he was in the wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s impossible to talk to him because no matter how I word it as soon as I say anything he can take as criticism he looses his mind and starts throwing around random personal insults like how I\u2019m so stupid and I\u2019m lucky he puts up with me, but there is never any resolution instead of talking about it (he\u2019s incapable of this) or apologizing or anything if I just leave him alone he pretends it never happened. There\u2019s no love bombing, no acknowledgement at all that anything even happened. It\u2019s very strange to me. Like he would have flipped out at me , made me cry then came in ten minutes later and asked me what my problem was when I gave him short answers and he would be like \u201cwhat\u2019s up your ass\u201d as if he couldn\u2019t remember what just happened.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m loosing my mind and I\u2019m sorry this was so long I guess I\u2019m just seeking validation that I\u2019m not going crazy and that I\u2019m in the right place", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My husband will DARVO me and then after I end up feeling guilty for having brought up feelings that never get heard or validated, he acts as though nothing has happened. Not only that, but he will walk around our house as though he\u2019s never been happier, whistling and singing and in the most wonderful mood., almost like his doing it antagonistically. That\u2019s not to say that I\u2019m moping about but I am definitely not feeling especially chipper after we\u2019ve had a long argument that amounted to no resolution (usually ending with him telling me it\u2019s all in my head and all my fault, my problem I need to give up to God or get over). \nI have brought this up to him a number of times that I notice he is overtly happy after we\u2019ve argued and haven\u2019t come to a resolution immediately afterwards as if he\u2019s trying to rub it in my face how happy he is or how much it doesn\u2019t  bother him that we aren\u2019t getting along.

Certainly, I take responsibility for my fair share of personal shortcomings, but we live in a world of cause and effect relationships. The roots of child abuse run deep, and they form a tangled web in my psyche that has led to me being a homeless recovering addict with a colorful spectrum of mental health problems.\n\nOne of my first memories is being thrown across the room when I was four. I don\u2019t remember why I was tossed like a ragdoll, but I distinctly remember sipping my juice box while my mom talked with the police officer at the front door. I feel obligated to share the strength of this memory, because my father would later deny these events ever happened. \n\nGas-lighting is common for him - he routinely chooses his ego over family, which was apparent as I tried to bridge the gap between us on my spiral down to the streets.I\u2019ve decided to go no contact with him after recent outreach attempts have returned the same condescending, compassionless responses. When I asked for fatherly advice while feeling desperate and suicidal, he had little more to say than \u201cdon\u2019t kill yourself,\u201d and \u201cget your shit together.\u201d \n\nIt is that lack of loving care that I desperately wanted my whole life, without ever realizing that it was his approval I needed more than anything. Instead, I lived for vengeance, as I saw my father as the personification of pure evil. In the beginning stages of my schizoaffective symptoms (though I wouldn\u2019t know anything was wrong until later), I created and believed a whole mythology of how I was a god who was tormented by my deity of a father for being imperfect - a perfect mirror to what was going on in my real life.\n\nAfter my mother died when I was nine, I was left with my father who began dating again. I remember my life was divided into sagas, where each new person he brought into my life waxed and waned, as he could only keep up the appearance of being a saintly widower caring for his son/daughter (I\u2019m mtf trans but didn\u2019t know until much later in life) for so long. His mood would reflect the state of his relationships, and his abuse, both physical and emotional, would ramp up to extreme levels when things weren\u2019t going right for him.\n\nFor instance, when I was ten, his second major relationship was starting to turn rocky. During this time, the water line burst in our basement. While he was hauling the water up, he asked if I had done my homework. As it was a Saturday, I hadn\u2019t. I had no idea why he asked outside of giving him an excuse to pummel me. You see, after berating me for being lazy, he got furious with me and soon we were on the floor. He was over me, smashing my head into the linoleum of the kitchen floor. This happened several times as afterwards I had to help get the door for him while doing my homework. Naturally, my hands were shaking and I slammed the door open trying to be as efficient as he wanted me to do. \n\nSoon after all the water was drained, his girlfriend called and he was calm again. We went out to dinner with her sons that night like nothing ever happened.\n\nWhen I was eleven, his future ex-wife left for a darts tournament. I suspect something was amiss around this time, because my father was in a really sour mood. I tried to avoid him by playing video games, but this just pissed him off more. During this time, I eventually forgot to take out the trash from the kitchen, which led to him dragging my by the leg to my room, punching it and making me think he was going to break it. \n\nHe didn\u2019t, but he picked me up, shook me, and began smashing my head into the back of my door, breaking that instead. After throwing me to the ground and telling me to lay there like a dog, he proceeded to clear out my shelves - which contained everything my mom had ever made me -  in two rabid sweeps of him arms. \n\nI laid there, completely frozen in shock, as he cleaned up the mess he made. When he finished and was about to go to the dump, he made me stand. I would continue standing perfectly still for the remainder of the day until I passed out some 8-10 hours later. During this time, he would come to me and ask if I had anything to say. I tried coming up with an apology for being selfish and not thinking of his needs during this time, but nothing I said was good enough. Near the end of the day, he would begin lecturing me and insinuate I was a horrible human being for choosing to play video games when my mom was close to death.\n\nThat sort of psychological torture was common. In high school, I would become bulimic because I was not good enough for him in track, despite owning half of our school\u2019s record board and competing on a national level. There was a time when I was practicing three times a day, once in the morning, and then twice back to back in the evening. He was living vicariously through me, as self-evident by the fact that he still has all the rewards I earned plastered on the walls of his living room. When I failed, he failed, and that was not tolerated. He wasn\u2019t mad, he was livid, a fact he repeated many times as he shit in my soul for nights at a time.\n\nOn top of this, everything I did was criticized and I was belittled for the smallest things. Once I cut my hair the way I wanted, which really wasn\u2019t that different than how it was before, and I didn\u2019t hear the end of it for weeks. He still stalks me on social media, but while I still lived in his house, most anything I posted was met with a sarcastic comment or at least something letting me know he was watching everything I was doing. \n\nThat sort of hyper-obsessive and vile watching eye is what led to me living in denial of my identity for so long. In fact, for the longest time, It has felt like I had a dead limb attached to my psyche, there but unable to be interacted with. Now, it feels like my masculine and feminine energies are like oil and water. I\u2019m still healing and mending who I am, so eventually this may change, but right now I\u2019m stuck in a nonbinary state that is ever-changing.\n\nAdditionally, I live in a slipstream of synchronicities. I like to say being schizoaffective is like being bipolar, but the aliens are constantly abducting me in order to protect me from the CIA, who is creating a reality TV show around my life. Every day it feels like the universe is sending me messages, most of which revolve around me not being good enough and that I need to improve. It\u2019s not hard to see how my psyche was molded over time to perpetually trap me in a reality built of the quicksands of negative self-image. \n\nStill, I\u2019m in an infinitely better place than where I once was. I\u2019ve been sober for a few months now, and while there are moments of weakness where I feel I may use again, I have a greater sense of a mission on this planet that is guiding me toward brighter futures. I may be homeless, but the experiences I\u2019ve had on the streets have been the most radically transformative of my life. I feel infinitely more independent than I once was.\n\nMy core philosophy is that free will is a skill - if we walk down a new road every day eventually we will be able to navigate to any destination. If we are regularly pushing our boundaries, we cannot help but step outside our comfort zone and expand as a person. Having no stability has forced me to recondition myself, opening new doors and avenues for myself moving forward. I\u2019m so much more calm and present than I once was. Even though my emotions are still a roller coaster, it feels more like a kids ride now, and at the very least I have stopped self-harming since being on this new concoction of medications. \n\nI am hopeful for the future. More importantly, I am grateful for the present. Being grateful changes everything in our perspective; it is like wearing glasses to see the world through a different lens. I may have traveled through some harsh roads growing up, but if I didn\u2019t I would not be who I am right now. Every experience is a blessing, and we are all here to enjoy the ride of our lives. The highs would be meaningless without the lows, and there are so many small moments of joy to be found in every day. There is only up from here, and I want to bring some of the light I have found into others\u2019 lives. I hope you found something meaningful in my story, and I hope you have many bright days ahead of you.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

In the beginning stages of my schizoaffective symptoms (though I wouldn\u2019t know anything was wrong until later), I created and believed a whole mythology of how I was a god who was tormented by my deity of a father for being imperfect - a perfect mirror to what was going on in my real life.\n\nAfter my mother died when I was nine, I was left with my father who began dating again. I remember my life was divided into sagas, where each new person he brought into my life waxed and waned, as he could only keep up the appearance of being a saintly widower caring for his son/daughter (I\u2019m mtf trans but didn\u2019t know until much later in life) for so long. His mood would reflect the state of his relationships, and his abuse, both physical and emotional, would ramp up to extreme levels when things weren\u2019t going right for him.\n\nFor instance, when I was ten, his second major relationship was starting to turn rocky. During this time, the water line burst in our basement. While he was hauling the water up, he asked if I had done my homework. As it was a Saturday, I hadn\u2019t. I had no idea why he asked outside of giving him an excuse to pummel me. You see, after berating me for being lazy, he got furious with me and soon we were on the floor. He was over me, smashing my head into the linoleum of the kitchen floor. This happened several times as afterwards I had to help get the door for him while doing my homework. Naturally, my hands were shaking and I slammed the door open trying to be as efficient as he wanted me to do. \n\nSoon after all the water was drained, his girlfriend called and he was calm again. We went out to dinner with her sons that night like nothing ever happened.\n\nWhen I was eleven, his future ex-wife left for a darts tournament. I suspect something was amiss around this time, because my father was in a really sour mood. I tried to avoid him by playing video games, but this just pissed him off more. During this time, I eventually forgot to take out the trash from the kitchen, which led to him dragging my by the leg to my room, punching it and making me think he was going to break it. \n\nHe didn\u2019t, but he picked me up, shook me, and began smashing my head into the back of my door, breaking that instead. After throwing me to the ground and telling me to lay there like a dog, he proceeded to clear out my shelves - which contained everything my mom had ever made me -  in two rabid sweeps of him arms. \n\nI laid there, completely frozen in shock, as he cleaned up the mess he made. When he finished and was about to go to the dump, he made me stand. I would continue standing perfectly still for the remainder of the day until I passed out some 8-10 hours later. During this time, he would come to me and ask if I had anything to say. I tried coming up with an apology for being selfish and not thinking of his needs during this time, but nothing I said was good enough. Near the end of the day, he would begin lecturing me and insinuate I was a horrible human being for choosing to play video games when my mom was close to death.\n\nThat sort of psychological torture was common. In high school, I would become bulimic because I was not good enough for him in track, despite owning half of our school\u2019s record board and competing on a national level. There was a time when I was practicing three times a day, once in the morning, and then twice back to back in the evening. He was living vicariously through me, as self-evident by the fact that he still has all the rewards I earned plastered on the walls of his living room. When I failed, he failed, and that was not tolerated. He wasn\u2019t mad, he was livid, a fact he repeated many times as he shit in my soul for nights at a time.\n\nOn top of this, everything I did was criticized and I was belittled for the smallest things. Once I cut my hair the way I wanted, which really wasn\u2019t that different than how it was before, and I didn\u2019t hear the end of it for weeks. He still stalks me on social media, but while I still lived in his house, most anything I posted was met with a sarcastic comment or at least something letting me know he was watching everything I was doing. \n\nThat sort of hyper-obsessive and vile watching eye is what led to me living in denial of my identity for so long. In fact, for the longest time, It has felt like I had a dead limb attached to my psyche, there but unable to be interacted with. Now, it feels like my masculine and feminine energies are like oil and water. I\u2019m still healing and mending who I am, so eventually this may change, but right now I\u2019m stuck in a nonbinary state that is ever-changing.\n\nAdditionally, I live in a slipstream of synchronicities. I like to say being schizoaffective is like being bipolar, but the aliens are constantly abducting me in order to protect me from the CIA, who is creating a reality TV show around my life. Every day it feels like the universe is sending me messages, most of which revolve around me not being good enough and that I need to improve. It\u2019s not hard to see how my psyche was molded over time to perpetually trap me in a reality built of the quicksands of negative self-image. \n\nStill, I\u2019m in an infinitely better place than where I once was. I\u2019ve been sober for a few months now, and while there are moments of weakness where I feel I may use again, I have a greater sense of a mission on this planet that is guiding me toward brighter futures. I may be homeless, but the experiences I\u2019ve had on the streets have been the most radically transformative of my life. I feel infinitely more independent than I once was.\n\nMy core philosophy is that free will is a skill - if we walk down a new road every day eventually we will be able to navigate to any destination. If we are regularly pushing our boundaries, we cannot help but step outside our comfort zone and expand as a person. Having no stability has forced me to recondition myself, opening new doors and avenues for myself moving forward. I\u2019m so much more calm and present than I once was. Even though my emotions are still a roller coaster, it feels more like a kids ride now, and at the very least I have stopped self-harming since being on this new concoction of medications. \n\nI am hopeful for the future. More importantly, I am grateful for the present. Being grateful changes everything in our perspective; it is like wearing glasses to see the world through a different lens. I may have traveled through some harsh roads growing up, but if I didn\u2019t I would not be who I am right now. Every experience is a blessing, and we are all here to enjoy the ride of our lives. The highs would be meaningless without the lows, and there are so many small moments of joy to be found in every day. There is only up from here, and I want to bring some of the light I have found into others\u2019 lives. I hope you found something meaningful in my story, and I hope you have many bright days ahead of you.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Right after the break up I realised this wasnt a normal relationship, because it literally felt like I was dying inside due to the hyper strong bond and codependency he manipulated me into over the 2 years we were together. I still believed him to be simply slightly flawed but overall my one true soul bond (I know now, that was never real) and excused all of his behaviour. The months after the break up, my mental state was a mess: his voice still dominated my own, I started having food issues (lots of bingeing cause I starved myself during our relationship to stay \"hot\"), depression and anxiety were at an all time high and I had no motivation whatsoever or plans for my life. By the end of the relationship I had successfully abandoned all my previous beliefs, dreams and world view and accepted his weird warped sense of the world. I still didnt understand what has happened and made the mistake of reengaging with him and he tried to manipulate me to come back to him (telling me I was his soulmate, of course) but I has already stared realizing that things were off and was able to resist taking him back and tried to just stay friends. However, since our contact was more sparse, I was finally able to reassess a lot of the behaviour, opened up to friends and realised the PTSD like flash backs I had from time to time actually happened because he emotionally abused and sexually coerced my over the past years to do things I wasnt comfortable with, make me put his needs above my own and make me believe I was doomed without him. Through therapy and lots of self work I realised how he treated me and who he really was, which is not a misunderstood genius but a predator and abuser (I also found out I havent been the only one, he has a long history of abused exes). A couple months ago I was finally able to cut contact with him for good and I dont intent to ever reengage again, which helped to finally move on. But now I dont know what to do with the aftermath of emotional and mental distress he left me with. I feel like I lost so much time and I still struggle with body image, food issues and overall lack of motivation in my life towards things that used to have meaning and make me happy.

My stepfather seems to have ongoing undiagnosed mental health issues that created an unstable and extremely stressful environment growing up for myself and my siblings. There was never any physical abuse, just emotional and mental. Looking at the toxic behavior of my maternal grandmother and great aunt, I have to wonder if there isn\u2019t a litany of undiagnosed mental health problems in my family. \n\nNow that I\u2019m an adult I do my best to take responsibility for my life and be a good person, but I have always struggled with low self esteem and fear of abandonment or being left alone. As I\u2019ve gotten older I feel more empty inside and struggle with identity, feeling like there\u2019s nothing that makes me special or important. I don\u2019t have many friends, and my family doesn\u2019t reach out to me or seem to care, so I\u2019m at a point in my life where the only person I have besides myself is my spouse. I am alternating between ignoring the pain my parents have caused me and being content for a little bit, and then it all overwhelms me at once and I\u2019m crushed with depression again. I have also struggled in the past with work, taking things far too personally and having difficulty accepting criticism on the job, which only invites further criticisms. It has also impacted my ability to make or keep friends, as I honestly do care about others and try to be a good friend, but if I feel they are not treating me well or do me harm, I react emotionally instead of keeping my cool and end up costing myself the friendship. All of these things I am aware the problems stem from myself and my insecurities, and then I mentally beat myself up for my shortcomings and vow to do better, be better you name it. Then I fail again at one thing or another and the cycle repeats itself. When I get so overwhelmed with emotions I become extremely tempted to react impulsively on my feelings, going so far as too spend too much money on something just to feel better, smoke half a pack of cigarettes in one sitting, or instigate fights with people I care about just to get the pent up frustrations out. I have not gone to a doctor to be diagnosed yet, though I am considering it. I don\u2019t want to self diagnose and possibly cause more harm than good, though I can\u2019t help but noticing I have (past &amp; present) displayed all the classic traits of borderline personality disorder. And while I try to learn how to regulate my emotions, I still need support and people to turn to. I don\u2019t want to put all of that weight on my spouse but I really don\u2019t have anyone else in my life right now. I\u2019m worried he\u2019ll scoff at my concerns or try to make light of it, and I\u2019ll be crushed if he does. \n\nI feel I have no one to turn to, even though I\u2019m married my spouse doesn\u2019t seem to understand or have empathy towards individuals with mental health issues, so I feel I can\u2019t turn to him about my struggles as I\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll make me feel crazy. I can\u2019t turn to my family as their toxicity continues to exacerbate my issues. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts before and engaged in cutting a couple of times.

So, sorry for the shitty formatting or whatever, I guess I just need to let it out before I just blow up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI sometimes mention the emotional abuse I've gone through jokingly, mostly just trying to convince myself it wasn't a big deal and I was just being a stupid kid who wanted to grow up too fast. However, I don't think I can convince myself that this doesn't affect my everyday life. \n\nI was an only child and my parents divorced very early when I was young, too young to remember, but my father was working most of the time while I was growing up (I was under his custody). That meant I grew up with my grandmother and as hard as she tried to play or give me attention it was tedious especially since she was old. I remember my mother, while on one the Sunday's she took me out to spend time with her, brought me to a phone shop to help me purchase my very first phone. I was around 11-12? I had access to the internet and was incredibly na\u00efve, I was just being a kid and made a few online friends. \n\nWhen I was 13-years-old I moved in with my mother and I met a senior in grade 7, she and I talked about internet friends. I don't blame her for sharing her stories but I wished she hadn't told me about how great it was to talk to 'handsome men' online, I asked her for the website/app's name and that's when I met him. I was on KiK because of course, I was and just thinking about how stupid I was makes me want to tear my hair out. \n\nHe knew I was underage, he knew he was older than me but he convinced me that this was alright. I was just turning 14 when we began to talk and he would coax me into sending him pictures of myself, telling me how 'hot' it was that I was 14 and he was older. I don't want to remember all the things he said but he was just fucking disgusting. Eventually, in my walnut-sized brain, I knew this was wrong and I didn't feel comfortable with him. He began harassing me in group chats, demanding me to answer his texts and telling me I'm a horrible person so leaving him like that. That I didn't deserve to be loved, that no one would want me as he would and that I'd probably end up alone. 14-year-old me was freaked out about this, I had panic attacks about it and every time a notification from KiK came from my phone I felt like crying because I just wanted him to leave me alone. \n\nHis words hurt me, he'd been so sweet to me and knew me well enough to know how to flip that switch inside my brain to make me obedient to him despite being millions of miles away. \n\nI eventually deleted KiK, it became too toxic for me. \n\nBut he found me again, I'm not sure how but he did. It's been about a year after KiK (I was 15 and he was around 21-years-old), my brain actively pushes down and suppresses any memories of that godforsaken app and when he messaged me posing as a stranger I just befriended him. It terrifies me knowing how easily he put me back into that obedient mindset. The cues and wording were the exact same and the cycle just began. \n\nI was facing a pretty big exam that year so I was susceptible to his wishes because of stress. I was also having some personal issues with my gender identity and sexuality so he got lucky I guess. He'd convince me to send him videos of me and was incredibly sweet to me, always making sure that I returned his messages and his 'I love you's' and 'You're mine and only mine' with the same amount of devotion. I knew deep down he didn't mean it but it felt good to be wanted. So I stuck with him until I just couldn't take the number of times he asked for videos, always feigning concern if I talked about something stressing me out only to go back to 'why don't you jack off to relieve tension?' or something along those lines. It also put a strain on my body, at one point I felt so tired I'd just link him to other porn but he'd refuse them and continue demanding to have a 'session' with me. I faked orgasms and cried myself to sleep for going through with what he said. I felt so disgusted with myself, especially when I started caring for him whenever he talked about how hard work was today and stuff. \n\nI started caring about the guy who manipulated me, a minor, for sex videos and I felt so defeated.\n\nI stopped talking to him and to avoid going through the same cycle of being called useless and worthless so I blocked him. At this point, I started putting two and two together and realized he was the same guy from KiK which made me want to end it all for being so fucking stupid. It didn't stop him. I can't tell you how many times 'random' accounts with 0 followers would begin talking to me for no reason and each time it made me sick. \n\nWhen I was 16, he messaged me again and this time he apologized. It was just...so sweet. He was being sweet and genuine and I was so happy because I still cared for him. Deep down he still had a leash on me and this time he held it tighter than ever. He was determined. He messaged me every day, telling me how much he needed me and how beautiful I was and how much he wished he could hold me. The sex videos never stopped, he was just nicer about it this time. \n\nHe started pressuring me about doing a few things that I wasn't comfortable with and when I told him no he blew off. He called me every name in the book, telling me how stupid I was for not being to do such a simple task and that's when I really hit rock bottom. He just had so much control over me, it was like what he said was law and all I wanted for him to do is love me so I pleaded for him to stop. He did but the damage was done and I started actively thinking of suicide every waking moment. I knew I could stop the abuse and manipulation but I was scared, he had videos now and of my face in them too. I was fucking terrified of what he would do to ruin me.\n\nI had a close friend and just what to do because I didn't think I could think straight anymore. I was scared, I was so scared that I couldn't even function properly and cried myself to sleep for days over some fucking pedophile in another country. My friend told me to follow their instructions, block and just ignore any shady accounts. I didn't tell them the full story because I was embarrassed but enough so he knew how paranoid I am about it.\n\nI did what he told me to do. He messaged me again, angrier than I'd ever seen him but I denied his message requests. He tried another account, faking as a friend I lost touch with but after a few minutes of talking I noticed where the conversation was leading and how he used the same 'pet name'. Blocked immediately. \n\nI hate him, everything about him makes me feel revolted. I feel like my body isn't mine anymore and neither is my mind. Even while I'm showering or laying in bed, his face pops up and I just want to curl up and cry. Thinking of anything sexual makes me want to curl up because he's always in my mind just waiting to appear, it's been getting better but there are moments where I wish I knew what effect he'd have on me. I've fucked up every relationship I've ever had because I'm terrified of having someone put a leash on me without me noticing and it sucks, it genuinely sucks that he's just inside my head 24/7.\n\nI know this story isn't very...harsh or worthwhile, I'm not even sure if it belongs in this subreddit but I just wanted to get this off my chest for good.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Again, I dont tell them these things, internally I just start passionately hating them. Leaving them completely in the dark.\n\nAs far as the main character thing goes, that's pretty self explanatory. I lived in a house where I was singled out and hurt. I'm not sure way, but I do my best to just block it out at this point. I was never let out, or allowed to hang out with friends. Like, I was watched from my kitchen window as I got my mail as a teenager. My room was basically my world. So I never saw my life as exciting or happy. Infact I couldn't tell anyone what was going on at home, so it wasnt even a story I could tell. But when I looked at other peoples lives, suddenly it made sense why I was here. I wasnt meant to have my own story, I was meant to be a side character in everyone eleses. \n\nIt means that instead of wondering what I want, I can focus on how my actions and words are affecting those around me.

That I never did enough or didn't try hard enough. I did everything she told me to do, and I lost friends, but I did it because i knew it would make her happier. I didn't care if it hurt me, as long she was happy. If made her life easier, I was happy. And I put myself second for 5 years.\n\nLast week I finally broke. After arguing for multiple days I called it off. But she was so damn upset and confused I couldn't bring myself to doing such a horrible act against her, so I said we'll go on break and see how I feel, but I need time to process. Give me space.\n\nShe did give me space at the start, but then it slowly evolved into more and more and more contact. She was so upset, depressed and distraught. She was begging me to come back, full on begging me. I needed more time and I was super scared I already made my decision and it wasn't her. She just kept going and going and I couldn't take it any more, she was so fucking emotional, I had to power to make her happy and she just wanted 1 chance (She also fully confessed and she now see's all her mistakes, even when I didn't mention some to her). I told her I need more time. I really tried to stand my ground I told her im not ready to decide, its only been 4 fucking days. She couldn't stand it anymore\n\nAfter 5 days I gave in. She wanted to meet up in a few days to have one last chance. I said yes. I said yes because I couldn't stand her being so upset anymore. I couldn't stand her constantly begging me, even when I told her to stop. I didnt want to say yes. I am not ready for any relationship again I am done and I said yes because I knew it would make her happier, and sure enough it did...\n\nI think my only option now is to send her a huge message and then block her on all socials. I feel like im committing murder at this point. I dont want to hurt her I still care about her so much, but I do not want to be in a relationship with her anymore. I tried super fucking hard to put myself first (for like the first time in our relationship too). I want to be stronger. I need to man the fuck up. What are my options? I feel like blocking her suddenly after her feeling like we're back in a relationship is pure evil.\n\nThanks", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We dated 3 years ago and it ended so badly I went NC for 3 years but he kept reaching out. This year was a milestone for me so when he reached out, we reconnected. After he promised changes, we started dating again but after 1.5 months I couldn't take it and would break up/leave. But a day or two later I would apologize and come back and promise to try harder.  After 3 months I was done. \n\nThe last big argument we had was Oct 30 and I said I was done and not coming back. A few days later he called \"just to hear my voice\" but that turned into him raging for over an hour while I sat in silence and was blamed for everything in his life and how he would never ever forgive me for being so evil and cruel.\n\n2 days later a text seeing how I'm doing and how sad he is that I'm not checking on him. Every few days we'd send a few texts back and forth but I kept it firm that we were not in a relationship. I even told him I would do everything I already did (cook, clean, put money towards his bills, help his child with homework) but I would be doing so as a friend and support system, not his girlfriend. Total fit and rage and refusal. To him, the fact that I stopped doing them at all just showed how little I cared about him. I should be willing to help him change so he can make me happy and blah blah blah some jabs and guilt trips I've told him repeatedly to stop using but he replied he would stand by them because he had a right to be upset. \n\nTwo nights ago he reaches out, just wants to meet at our old star-gazing spot up the street to chat. I go and listen to his problems calmly and objectively. It's cold out and I'm bundled up but he's not and he's shivering. I now see the ploy.\n\n\"Is it ok if I put my arm around you\"\n\"Is it ok if I hold your hand\"\n\"Is it ok if I kiss your forehead\"\n\"Is it ok if I kiss your cheek\"\n\nI say yes to these and we keep chatting until he is visibily shaking. We walk back and sit in his car and share a long hug goodbye. \n\n\"Is it ok if I kiss your forehead?\"\nYes.\nHe does.\nThen leans down to kiss my lips. I pull away and say no thank you.\n\n\"Is it ok if I kiss you?\" \nI say again \"No, thank you\"\nAnd he is visibily upset. \n\nI go to my car and drive home, he calls on the way to express how upset that made him and he wants us back together. I say maybe we should focus on getting him back on his feet before we talk about why our relationship ended because there's so much to hash out.\n\nHe gets upset and interrupts says I'm making this decision for the both of us but it only benefits me, how he can work on himself and be with me too, how much pain I'm causing him, etc. \n\nI interrupt back but I dunno what I was gonna say, that action was enough for it to turn into a fight (my fault of course) but after a few minutes of him yelling to let him speak, he rages for about 20 or so then is ready to get off the phone before I can say how feel. \n\nAnd I just lost it. I sent him two text essays that night, something he has done for years whenever he felt crossed. Only mine wasn't laced with blame and guilt trips. I told him how I was done with his behavior. No response and I go to bed.\n\nAnd wake up PISSED. 8AM and I shoot off more text essays about how fake his \"Is it ok\" shit is if when I do say no, he loses it. How he needs to stop saying I left over and over because he told me about his depression but really it was because he had two moods: sulking and lashing out and I was always in the crossfire. I go OFF about how he made me feel, hurt me, etc. \n\nHe responds back and confirms his narcness. Denies, says it's not as bad as I make it seem, how I've done worse to him but he still loves me enough to want to work it unlike me etc then is all calm and mature like \"let's not start our morning this way, I hope you have a good and productive day\"\n\nI open IG 2 hours later and he sent me some bs inspo meme about how loyally he loves until the person gives him a reason to walk away. \n\nI lose it some more and flood him with memes from  narc abuse recovery and breakups. We go back and forth a bit and I'm not sorry for shit. No longer trying to be nice or appease his sunken mood or eggshells. He said if I was this outspoken while together, we could have made it work.\n\nI snapped back. When was I allowed to speak? If he was in a bad mood (always) then I was pushing an issue at the wrong time and if his mood has somehow lifted, it was the wrong time for me to bring something back up and stress him when he thought it was resolved already...even though we never talked about it. \n\nNo response to that but says if I'm so abused then I'm free now to go get help. He wishes he could get help but not everyone is so lucky like me. He wishes me well with therapy and suggests they check my meds \"out of concern because you're being irrational\". He insists that he would have changed for me if I had just been patient and stop leaving the minute we fought. But he was going to change for the better with or without me and the next woman who would actually give him a real chance will actually love him like I failed to. \n\nSo I said do it. Change. Go to therapy for 3 months and I'll start to believe that to be true. I told him I already found one in the neighborhood who accepts sliding scale and I will pay for it. I meant it. \n\n\"Fuck outta here\"\n\nLol. of course. But you'll do anything to make me happy right? I tell him this is all I want. The only thing.\n\nAnd I haven't heard a peep from him since. I realized I had been texting him 4 hours straight since I woke up just refuting and snapping back.\n\nWhat's crazy is that I went back and read all the texts and it makes me look as mean as he says, I barely recognize me but then again I barley defend myself to this point of anger. I know now it's so he can continue to play victim. I offered help and money, even buy him a new car to replace his junker,  but it's not enough if it's not my sanity as well. I told him on all platforms to go to therapy, that's all I want and I'll give it another shot.\n\nNo response. It's almost been 3 weeks since I did the initial break up and  feel like I finally did it. I'm still catching myself wondering about him and his wellbeing but today I finally feel single.\n\nI feel guilty for the way I behaved but not weak enough to cave. The anger is fresh and waiting for when I need it. I have the list, been doing the research.  I'm going to keep pushing individual therapy every time he tries to Hoover me back.  I know he'll never do it and I'll remind myself that's why he'll never change.

They never change/improve\n2. They are toxic and dangerous\n3. No matter WHAT you do, Drama comes along.\n\nI'd like to elaborate a little more on point number 3. If like myself you find yourself currently out of a relationship with a Narc, it doesnt really matter how it ended, I want to ask you a question:\n\n\"How stressed have you been recently?\"\n\nFor me, I no contacted my Narc and blocked on all forms of social media, mobile numbers everything. She was toxic, and not the right partner for me. My story of how it ended was something out of a movie.\n\nTo cut a long story short, HUGE fight. She was rude, disrespectful, same old shit. I kicked her out. But then she caused a scene in the streets, alerting my neighbours. Absolute BLOODY nightmare. So I stormed out of the house threatening to call the police and watched her run off like a coward.\n\nAs I turned around the front door slammed into my face. It was also despite being summer, a very wet, cold and windy evening. I was in my shorts and tee. With no phone or anything but my car keys, and no shoes on. I sat in my car, and waited thinking how I was going to sort the key out. \n\nI should mention I was going through ALOT workwise and many other stressful things going on. This was the last thing I needed, stress in my relationship.\n\nIt was THAT moment of solitude, and reflection that made me realize \"I MUST LEAVE THIS RELATIONSHIP.\" And so I did, and never looked back.\n\nFast forward several months and I have begun dating myself. I do what I want, when i want. I go where I want. I see who I want. And its delightful. I even do the things I used to do with my Nex, completely alone. Its truly wonderful.\n\nAnd just this past weekend, I was strolling back from going shopping (a hobby I like to do) to the places we used to go, and new ones as a couple with a spring in my step. I said to myself \"my god, it was her. SHE added to the stress. Caused WAY MORE DRAMA. MADE MY LIFE MORE DIFFICULT.\"\n\nI felt lightest I ever felt in years. I felt confident. I felt a NEW but REBORN MAN.\n\nI rediscovered who I was. And its truly exhilarating.\n\nSo ask yourself \"how stressed have you been recently?\" But make that MORE about your relationship.

I've tried to put my foot down with this and say no and explain that I hate doing it because she always finds something to be upset about.

After this I changed my password as I thought this was a breach of my privacy. When I was in the shower the other week she tried to get into my phone and then questioned me on why I had changed my password to which I explained why. She said how this had affected her trust of me. I can understand from her point of view but my trust was affected when she went through my phone while I was asleep.\n* I feel as if she takes a disliking to anyone I am associated with. I feel awkward spending time with my family because she hates them for something that doesn't warrant those feelings. I feel awkward and uncomfortable going out with friends because I've always felt as if this would upset her. It feels like I'm being isolated. The other week we spoke about not meeting on a certain day per week due to use seeing each other and being bored and she said \"urgh I just hate the thought of you being at home\" meaning she hated the thought of me spending time with my family. She has often asked whether I would choose her over family members.\n* She has told me she gets jealous of friends/family when I spend time with them.\n* I end up apologizing a lot of the time even when I know I've done nothing wrong.\n* I constantly feel guilty and paranoid.

Sometimes my grandma would convince them to let me stay, other times she would hide from me when they came to get me so I couldn't run to her, and then there were the times when she herself would just up and put me in the car to go drive around town because she didn't want me to leave. \n\ntruly, i believed my grandma and I were the best of friends. we did everything and went everywhere together. when i was with my parents, however, my life felt completely different. my dad would often come home completely wasted, confrontational, he would start screaming at my mom, hitting her, dragging her down the stairs by her hair. i don't remember the first time i saw it happen, nor do i remember each time perfectly, but certain images and moments are still as fresh on my mind as the day that they happened. my dad never beat on us the way that he beat on my mom, but both of my parents were and are still very firm believers in hitting your kids as discipline.\n\nthere was one night in particular that i think of probably at least daily. this time when my dad came home drunk, my mom already knew the drill and thought that she could get us all out of the house before things got really bad. at this time there was only four of us kids, me(8), my brother(6/7), our little sister(4/5), and our baby brother(2). it was in December, closer to Christmas than not. my dad comes in, starts with his yelling, my mom starts rushing us all to get our coats on and to help her get our baby brother bundled up. she then tells us to start running out to the car, we all listen, and she begins to follow us out. on her way out, my dad manages to get a hold on her hair and drag her down. us kids all keep running to the car, i can hear my mom screaming and my dad cursing at her. at the time we had a small koi pond in our back yard, being December, it had frozen over and the water was pretty rotten and putrid. my dad pushed my mother into it, i remember hearing a big splash/crash but not being able to see what was happening because of our privacy fence. i was scared that my dad would be the one to come out of the gate and that my mom would die. somehow, though, my mom got away and made it into the car. she smelled awful, and she was soaked. i was crying so hard that i was scared i would throw up and get in trouble, so each time i gagged something up i just kept swallowing it. i remember it all so vividly. \n\nmy mom gets the keys in the ignition and starts to pull away when suddenly my dad's truck starts up. we think he is going to speed off and leave us alone, instead, he hits the gas and comes flying into the back of the car. the back of the car gets kind of smashed, i believe the back window either cracked or shattered because i remember being scared that the glass would get on my little siblings and cut them up. my dad suddenly backs up again, and repeats the process of crashing into us. i remember being so shocked, so dumbfounded that this was ACTUALLY happening to me. he just kept slamming into us, and we were getting smashed up against the garage wall. with each ram from the truck, i just remember seeing us get closer to the wall, and feeling the car get more and more compacted. i thought for sure that i was going to die. i remember very clearly thinking to myself \"im eight years old and my dad is going to kill me\". i thought about the local news lady that i watched every morning while getting ready for school. i pictured her covering the story about how my father had killed his family just a few days before christmas. i thought about her telling everyone our ages, showing them our pictures and talking about the elementary school we all attended. \n\njust as quickly as it had happened it was over, my dad sped off suddenly. our neighbor comes running up to the car and says he called the police, that's where the memory ends for me. \n\nthere's so much more bullshit that ive endured from my mom, who is insanely manipulative and likes to dangle her love and acceptance over my head like im a dog and its some kind of milkbone. ive been gaslit so much in my lifetime i really am not sure if what has happened to me really counts as an abusive or even slightly traumatic situation. any time ive tried to talk to her about it she downplays it severely and tells me \"it wasn't that big of a deal, boo hoo.\" and it leaves me feeling so hurt and angry. i feel so invalidated. there's been other events in my life that have scarred me as well, some not involving family members at all, but it would take me ages to type it all up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni just feel so alone sometimes. today i struggle with depression, anxiety, and moderate-severe obsessive compulsive disorder. i feel split into two, a side of me who has been traumatized, who is hurt and angry, and a side of me who is self loathing, who says things like \"boo hoo\" and \"suck it up, you don't even have it bad\" and it's tearing me apart. im 20 now, terrified and clueless as to how to function in the world. obsessions consume my thoughts and compulsions take up a good portion of my day. ive fallen behind after graduating high school in 2017, and have trouble working with Cerebral Palsy. the only time i feel even relatively normal is when i am high or drunk, which i know is not a path i want to take, as i am already at a genetic risk for addiction. OCD just makes me feel so crazy, since obsessions arent something i can talk about because no one would understand. thank you if you managed to read this whole thing, i just need to feel like someone is listening after my insurance dropped my therapy bills.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Anyway, I started to attend and it really made me feel better, I have spoke some about my reasons behind drinking, why I would drink to excess, how it made me feel better, etc.  I am starting to see that I was self medicating my own anxiety and depression by drinking, and I am starting to see how he adds to the problem and what he does that kind of encourages me to feel anxious, sad, scared, lonely, etc.\n\nWe spoke on the phone and I told him about how I was going to AA and how it was helping me, and of course I fell right into his trap...he \"pretended\" to be concerned and encourage me to open up, told me he would listen to me about the things I was feeling and why I felt compelled to drink.  So stupidly I told him that alot of his treatment of me makes me feel terrible, worthless, criticized, unimportant, unloved, unappreciated...basically I told him that alot of his treatment of me has made me feel like I am worth nothing, and the drinking helped to numb that.\n\nHe was pissed, started attacking me and saying \"Oh, just like you lied to your family and friends about me, now you are lying to a bunch of strangers in AA, all so you can get all your made up feelings validated.\"  \n\nI have never lied to my family and friends, I used to confide in them when I was doing really really bad and feeling suicidal, or like I just couldn't live anymore, etc.  I would just talk to people about how he made me feel and the things he would do, etc.  I guess the real problem is that I am not just taking the abuse constantly anymore and I am sharing it with other people.  He loves to put on this fake face and is seriously so delusional in his head that he thinks he is great and anything or anyone that might disagree with that is \"crazy\" or a \"liar\".\n\nIts just super bizarre to my how they make everything about them.

Her head was down with her hand over her face...she looked ashamed and in pain...quite disrespectful to her date if you ask me.\n\nThe last time she texted me about a month and a half ago (I didn't respond), she told me she has hated me for years, hopes I drop dead, that I will never amount to anything, she is going to ruin/sue me, she has people who would love to assault me and that she and/or her friends are going to damage my property...she was obviously  still angry at the fact that I finally discarded her after she hoovered me for the last time.\n\n This is all because I found out she cheated with quite a few people she swore until the bitter end that she never did.

I think it would come under 'Looking Back' if a flair is necessary. \n\nThank you to all who post here and offer strength to those in similar situations. I love the positivity shared in the comments and the openness that is offered here, to help us all heal and move on.\n\nIt's been 6 months since I finally left my ex. I spent 11 years with him. He chipped away at all the love I had for him, eked it away drip by drip. He was the 'I'll do it wrong so I don't have to keep doing it' type. If he acted a bit useless, a bit hapless, he knew I'd help him out. He shrunk from a confident, funny person into a simpering toddler unable to do anything himself. \nI let myself get slowly ingrained as his carer, maid, moral compass, financier and fuck buddy. \n\nAt the time I left, I got a few messages 'how could you do this' 'I can't breathe without you' which I ignored. I expected more but he went silent when his provocations went unheeded and I didn't rise to his bait. It was not easy but he didn't deserve anymore of my brain power, I'd already wasted enough on him. I wasn't willing to have the same fight for the 100th time and there was not the slimmest chance he would suddenly understand. Once I'd dropped the rope, the sigh of relief was worth just letting it go. \n\nThese months later, with no contact initiated from me, he messages me. Telling me he misses me so much. Wants to hear my voice. He misses us. He wants me to be happy. He tried his very best to give me space. \n\nI'm laughing so hard at his message right now. He never wanted to text me when we were together. We had quite a few fights about that while we were a couple. I asked him to message me if he wasn't coming home and he couldn't quite manage that. I never asked for a call, I may have been circling outside the rings of reality for the last four years or so of the relationship but I knew that was so far outside of his capabilities. He was at the pub! So busy! Far too busy to talk to me. But now he wants to chat. Wants to hear my voice. I don't have the time to spare I'm afraid. I'm too busy.\n\nHe misses us. Of course he does. I was his meek little maid who kept the house in order, ran his life for him and picked up whatever he decided wasn't worthy of his attention, what he couldn't be bothered with. I held him as he cried, telling me how badly his dad treated him by telling him the truth. I never made a fuss about him being too hungover to work until it was 3 times a week and I couldn't cope. I put up with a shit ton of stuff that weighed on me so heavily, to make his life easier. I enabled him to the point he got angry at me for not spoon feeding him his own life. I'd break problems into to do lists that got ignored then have to listen to him complain about the fallout since he hadn't done his job.\nHe once got annoyed at a client who was paying him 1k for 4 days work, at ten minutes a day. He was to check a workman was at her property, that was it, and he got pissed off when the work wasn't done since he hadn't checked up on them. He actually said to her 'what do you expect me to do?' I spat out my toast. Your job, maybe? I mean, what the fuck! Who couldn't handle that? But nothing was ever his fault. Didn't matter he was being paid to make sure the work was being done, it was the workmans fault for not being at work. At one point he said 'if she wanted it done so badly she should have been here overseeing it' when that was his exact job. Literally about two hours work over a few days for a grand. He couldn't do it. \n\nI held his leash so he could do as he pleased without worrying, he had someone paying attention to cover any mistakes, he could walk around blindly in a china shop and I'd be running around tucking things out his way to ensure he was ok. I first read the phrase 'setting yourself on fire to keep them warm' in one of these subs and it was a revelation. \n\nIt strikes me that after everything we went through together, after all the conversations and sacrifice and letters I wrote to him to try and get an understanding in his head about how to be a real boy, how to participate in life and a relationship, he hasn't once mentioned why we broke up. Not even a false 'it was all my fault'. He's tried a few tactics to goad me into talking to him, I wonder why admitting he let me down isn't part of his chat. Maybe it's because he let me down on such a fucking cataclysmic scale. Maybe he doesn't want to admit it or think about it. If he faces the truth, it'll feel real, perhaps? Maybe he's under the very mistaken impression if he misses me enough I'll come back.\nHe doesn't care about why it ended, just that it did. He doesn't care about the hurt he caused me. How empty he left me. How much he sucked out of me. He's forgotten the countless times I begged him for a little effort. How badly I burnt myself trying to keep him warm. He only noticed when the heat stopped. I can't believe I let myself be used for so long. \n\nI couldn't care less about what he wants. How sad he is. After an hour of walking out the door of our home, I shed no tears. I've not missed him once. Never reached for him. I'm still relieved to this day I don't have to share a bed with him, I smile myself to sleep, grateful at that alone. \nI realised I didn't reach for him to support me when we were together. I had to tell him things because he would take it so personally if I didn't. If I told a inconsequential story to a friend he hadn't heard, he would be hurt he didn't know it and ask why I had never told him that story. \n\nWhen I see things that remind me of him, there is no pang in my chest or stomach. I have no reservations about watching a movie we saw together and I think that's due to trying my absolute best with him. There was nothing else I could do. I know that in the deepest parts of me. I could chose to lie down and be the meek wife who has nice dresses and nothing behind her fake smile or strike out on my own, it petrified me to start with and yet, when I put one foot in front of the other, I enjoyed it. That was surprising. When there was no one constantly watching me, commenting, feeding my insecurities, I could make choices with a clearer head. There was no judgement, no one offended I hadn't involved them in decisions affecting only me. When I made a mistake, it wasn't the end of the world. \n\nHe destroyed everything he touched. He is the most selfish, arrogant, lazy, entitled shithead I've ever met. But I say that with no real distaste since I don't have to deal with him. I don't have to talk to him. He has no power over me at all and he doesn't like it. He can't put me back in my little spot because it doesn't exist. The day I left, I became me again. I could be proud of myself, I just had to try. It was all up to me, all my choice and I chose to live. I chose me for the first time in 11 years and I've not regretted it once.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We would spend a lot of time together (often with another friend we are close with) and it was clear (based on the things that he told us) that he really trusts us. He was reliable, courteous, and all around a really sweet, fun guy.\n\nThen he met his new boyfriend. It was a whirlwind romance, and suddenly he started bailing on me (and the other friend) like crazy, often to hang out with the new boyfriend's friends. The boyfriend invited himself on a trip that we had been planning with a whole bunch of friends, and nothing could convince this friend that it wasn't fair to the rest of us to bring a guy we didn't know.\n\nThey have now been together for 1.5 years, and this boyfriend is basically destroying his life. He convinces him to spend a fortune on multiple vacations (often with his own friends and family, then suggested that my friend get rid of his car to save money to support this lifestyle, thereby making him more dependent on him), he has him partying and drinking like he's half his age, and he has destroyed many of his relationships by insisting on always being there when he hangs out with friends.\n\nThe boyfriend insists on joining us every single time we get together with this friend.  If my friend (and everyone else involved) is available before the boyfriend is, we don't see our friend until the boyfriend is available and ready. They leave when the boyfriend is ready to leave. If on the way to meeting us, the boyfriend decides he would rather do something else first, they show up 2 hours late with no apology (he used to be the guy who was always early). In other situations they have taken off without giving me the courtesy of letting me know. This friend never did things like that before. When we do hang out, the boyfriend dominates the conversation with stories about the amazing things that he has done, and he always finds a way to redirect conversations to being about him or turn them into pissing contests to prove his superiority. He also has this desperate need to control everyone. We will go to a place that we have all been to hundreds of times, and he has only been there a few times, yet he acts like he's the only one who has any familiarity with the place and barks orders at everyone about what to do and where to go.\n\nSo basically it is coming to the point that I don't even want to hang out with my friend anymore, because I never get to see him without the annoying boyfriend controlling the situation. I know that my friend wants time alone with me, because as soon as the boyfriend goes to the bathroom, he will interrupt me mid-sentence to talk about things that he doesn't want to say in front of the boyfriend. He chooses what he says very carefully so as not to make it obvious that his relationship is toxic.  In the last 1.5 years, I have spent time alone with this friend (without his boyfriend) ONCE, and the boyfriend made sure that I knew that he was pissed about it.\n\nI have tried pointing out to my friend how it's not okay that he ditches me places or shows up hours late, but all I got was an empty apology, and then he called me \"selfish\" and said that he \"resented me making everything about me.\" In conflict management training, we are always taught to frame confrontations by using \"I language\" and explaining how someone else's actions affect us, but that doesn't seem to be working here (likely due to bullshit that his boyfriend has fed him). I am tempted to just stop seeing this friend, but then I know that I will let the narcissistic boyfriend win. Other friends of ours have already shut him out. They tried to explain why but didn't get anywhere.\n\nI need to have a good long talk with him about how his boyfriend is dominating our time together (and to gently let him know that his boyfriend's behaviour is not okay), but I am afraid that if he feels that I am attacking his relationship, he will just go on the defensive and not listen to me (like he did when I called him on the fact that he is treating me like shit).\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n1. Does this sound like narcissistic abuse?\n2. Do you have any ideas what I can say to get through to him without putting him on the defensive? Is there anything that you wish someone had said to you while you were caught up in toxic relationship that may have helped you \"wake up\" sooner? I don't know if he's ready to hear that his relationship is toxic.\n3. Is it helpful if I tell him that if his boyfriend insists on coming along every single time, that I don't want to hang out anymore, but I am here if he ever needs me? Will this help him open his eyes (and save my sanity) or is this abandoning him and letting the narcissist win?   \nEdit: I plan on requesting that we start hanging out without the boyfriend, but when he (likely) says no, I feel that I will be left with no option other than not hanging out anymore, hence question #3. \n\nSorry for the long-winded post, but if you're still reading, thank you!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

(First Post, Long Read)", "author": "whatdoesntkillyou", "self_text": "I\u2019ve heard a lot about this community. I think maybe a forum would be a good place to start, kind of like an online group therapy meeting. This is my first post here, and it\u2019s taken me awhile (it\u2019s a year and a half after the breakup) to get this far in talking about it. \n\nIs relationship PTSD a thing? There was never anything violent about our relationship, so I almost feel like what I\u2019ve gone through doesn\u2019t compare to those that I know with PTSD. Like I\u2019m not worthy to say that. But a year and a half after the fact, and I still get flashbacks every day. My heart still constricts every time I close my eyes. I\u2019ve been in two relationships since, and I\u2019ve never been able to connect like I did before. They\u2019re not him. \n\nBackstory: \n\nWe were coworkers in a very specific line of work which kept us in close quarters with time to kill since we worked nights. He was married, I didn\u2019t cross that line. But we were so similar. Our favorite music, movies, sense of humor, intelligence \u2014 it all flowed easily into conversation. We became friends... Strictly friends. A year into my position there, his wife suddenly gets insecure and forbids him to speak to me. All contact went out the door. And my job was in telecommunications where he was the receiving end of it, so it\u2019s not like he could just avoid me completely. But I was blocked, ignored, and treated as I didn\u2019t exist. It hurt my feelings at first, but I moved on. \n\nA year of the silent treatment and he suddenly shows up in my office more often (where others congregate between calls). I\u2019d start getting texts from a burner number with just chit chat. I find out he\u2019s going through a divorce and didn\u2019t really have a friend to talk to about it. So, my naive heart of course tries to help. I talk to him through the bad parts, and when I found out he was out drinking by himself in self pity, I invited him over to talk it out and give him company. \n\nAnd it started that night. He had intentions that I would have never seen coming, and he was manipulating me from the get go... and I fell for it. A few weeks of secretly seeing each other and he called it off. I was having fun. I really, really liked him. I finally could 100% be myself for once. But our job is sensitive in nature and he was my superior, so it was a bad idea. \n\nThe weekend passed and he said he couldn\u2019t stop thinking of me. That we could keep doing what we were doing but we couldn\u2019t fall in love. His divorce wasn\u2019t finalized and he \u201cno longer believed he was capable of loving emotions.\u201d I accepted that just to continue to be with him, thinking if he stayed around long enough maybe I\u2019ll be worthy of falling for. \n\nI could start to see how much of a grasp he had on me. I started telling my psychiatrist something was wrong with me. I felt like there was. How I felt crazy and paranoid, but also overly happy and wanted, and it all centered around my secret relationship. I was put on bipolar medicine within a month of seeing him. I had no prior history of bipolar. Some depression, yes, but I never felt out of control of my feelings before now. \n\nA few weeks later he breaks it off again, citing the same reasons. And a few days after he comes back with the same addiction line. This cycle continues every few weeks from October until December. We had a bad fight and stayed \u201coff\u201d for about two weeks where he would send me pages of texts about how I deserve more than him and he doesn\u2019t want me like I want him to. I finally start to stop answering. \n\nThen he shows up after weeks. Apologizing. Telling me I\u2019m beautiful. We make up. He finally wants to take me on a date, but it has to be out of town so work doesn\u2019t find out. \n\nNew Years Eve. We had an amazing time. The following weeks were distant. I start questioning what I did wrong. He pushes me away again. Tells me my meds aren\u2019t working, I need something better. Off to the psychiatrist I go to tell him that I need fixed again. Crazy side effects ensue. I reached out to a different coworker to take me to the hospital. My throat was closing shut and my skin broken out in hives. \n\nNarc doesn\u2019t care. Narc is pissed that I called the coworker, even though Narc wasn\u2019t speaking to me that week anyway. I hurt *his* feelings this time. Ego is bruised. He never wants to speak to me again. I\u2019m devastated. \n\nShows up to my apartment drunk that weekend. Without saying a word he looks at me and says he loves me with the most absolute fear in his eyes. I\u2019m elated. I did it. He wants me. I love him. I believe him. We are 6 months in at this moment. We agree to let our children meet each other. \n\nHe grows close to mine quickly. Sees her multiple times a week for the following 4 months. I met his once and then he would come  up with excuses every time I tried to again. \n\nMore fighting. He started pushing me away. Told me I need fixed again. I changed bipolar meds 4 times in 10 months to fix myself. I\u2019d see that he was hiding his phone. I never brought it up. I\u2019d see that he was ignoring my messages. I\u2019d see that he was caught in lies. I\u2019m still a secret. \n\nI quit my job. I don\u2019t want to be a secret. I love him. I found a better job, but I also have no reason to hide anymore. If people knew about me, maybe he won\u2019t entertain others\u2019 DMs. \n\nMaybe if I clean his slobby home for him he will love me.\nMaybe if I take care of him he will love me. \nMaybe if I buy him gifts for him and his children he will love me. \nMaybe if I am sexy enough for him he will love me. \nMaybe if I\u2019m not crazy he will love me. \nMaybe.... \n\nTwo weeks after I quit my job we fight. He lied about going to his ex wife\u2019s house for a party while telling me he couldn\u2019t see me because he had the kids. Ouch. \n\nI\u2019m begging. I am trying so hard to be what you want. Why is it not good enough? What am I doing wrong? \n\nHe comes over to bring my stuff to me. We sleep together again. I think it\u2019s fixed, just like always. He tells me to my face I\u2019m a mistake. \n\nThe breakup happened May 2018. \n\nHe\u2019s been in a relationship with another girl for over a year since. How can he love her but not me? Why were they never a secret? She gets to be everything I wanted to be with him. \n\nWhen they fight he unblocks me, just to make sure I\u2019m still tightly wound on his string. I\u2019m the runner up. It happens every couple months. Messaging. Flirting. Reminiscing. Making sure I still feel everything. And I do. Especially the hurt. I feel that every day. I still have dreams about it. I can\u2019t listen to my favorite music anymore without thinking of him. I can\u2019t watch the shows we started together. I can\u2019t pass his house on my way to work without glancing. When does it end?\n\nI bought \u201cWhen Loving Him is Hurting You\u201d and only could get through the first chapter. I\u2019m not religious, so it was hard to relate to it. I need something. Literature? Support? Therapy more than once a month? I don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s not healing on its own.\n\nI don\u2019t want to live like this anymore.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My father and I clearly have a horrible relationship, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s abuse? This is probably going to be really long, but I would appreciate the advice so much.\n\nMy paternal grandfather was physically abusive to my father and his siblings. As a result of that, my father used to hit me when I was young to punish me. Not horrible stuff, but because of him hitting me I have always been somewhat scared of him.  When I was about 10 years old, he stopped and realized that wasn\u2019t the best way to handle things. Ever since that, he\u2019s been (what I think might be) emotionally abusive.\n\nTo start off, he\u2019s always called me names in situations where he\u2019s frustrated with me, and sometimes even when he isn\u2019t.  Names like stupid, dumbass, idiot, bitch, etc. He also likes to hit me as a joke a lot too. He\u2019ll walk up behind me and smack me hard on my back, knocking the air out of me. He\u2019ll punch me and laugh, and when I start to cry, he will mock me and say something like \u201cOh stop it, you baby! That did not hurt! You need to toughen up.\u201d\n\nThis past summer my dad found out that I didn\u2019t believe in god anymore. I come from a very religious family and wasn\u2019t going to tell them until I had moved out, but he found out through reading my texts without telling me. He took my phone from me, as well as my car and tried to convince me that my boyfriend had manipulated me into changing my thoughts. When I tried to explain to him that I had been feeling this way for longer than I had even known my boyfriend, he told me my facts didn\u2019t check out and therefore I was lying. Countless times throughout the next 6 hours or so, he told me I was a liar and everything going wrong was my boyfriend\u2019s fault. Anytime I cried, he would mockingly ask me why I was crying. I spent the next 3 months completely cut off from everyone. I was lectured at least once a day often for hours at a time, and it felt like the only reason I mattered to him was to be a good little church girl. When he found out that I had been suicidal at one point a year or so ago, he yelled and cursed at me telling me I was selfish and stupid. And because of his influence, I still believe that to a certain degree but I am too scared to mention it.\n\nHe always says he wants me to talk to him about things if I\u2019m struggling, but when I have in the past, he reacts either with pure anger, or dismissiveness. He\u2019ll do things that hurt me emotionally, and then tell me it was a joke. For example, he told me once that my \u201ctheme song\u201d is a song that the first line of the chorus is \u201cI\u2019m a bitch\u201d, and when I appeared a little hurt by this, he said, \u201cIt was a joke, stop overreacting.\u201d\n\nHe makes me feel self-conscious by telling me my shirt makes me look fat right as I\u2019m leaving the house or things like that, and he\u2019s endlessly sarcastic with me. It\u2019s to the point where I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s joking or being serious, and then he will get mad at me for reacting the wrong way.\n\nHe\u2019s also very controlling. He or my mother have to be aware of where I am and what I\u2019m doing and who I\u2019m with all the time. If they don\u2019t immediately get an answer from me, I\u2019ll get at least five calls one right after the other, and then they\u2019re mad when I finally answer, even if I was just driving and couldn\u2019t answer. I\u2019ve been threatened to be beaten until I couldn\u2019t sit down, just because my room was messy. He\u2019s extremely unpredictable in how he reacts and I find myself more scared of him because of it. In quite a few situations, he\u2019s blamed me for causing his reactions, or creating the situation. He\u2019ll tell me my decisions don\u2019t affect him, and then come back the next day and make me feel guilty because he\u2019s worried about me and he can\u2019t focus at work and keeps getting in trouble for it.  \n\nHe\u2019ll make comments about how I don\u2019t love him even in front of my family, and when I object he\u2019ll laugh or ignore me. I\u2019ll tell him about an issue I\u2019m having, and he\u2019ll deny that it exists to my face, but then in front of other people he\u2019ll bring it up and talk about how it\u2019s a problem that needs to be recognized only to deny it again the next time I ask him about it. He insists we obey his rules and becomes unreasonably frustrated when they are broken.\n\nThese are most of the issues. He also manages to confuse me though. He\u2019ll do something super sweet or say something so caring. He gives me just the right amount of love and care that I really have no clue what to do. I\u2019m so sorry this is so incredibly long. I would really appreciate sincere advice on what to do and where to go. I\u2019m also not sure this constitutes emotional abuse, so if I could get answers to the question too, that would be wonderful. Thank you all so much in advance!!!", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I am not sure what has been said. Either you have been told that I am crazy and jealous and just won't leave him alone or you received a weepy sob story about how 'we just didn't work.' I know when I was being told about the woman before me, he told me that he never truly loved her and that he settled. He told me how she was a good woman but that it was insanity to keep trying. He told me that he didn't really mean to chest on her all of those time- it was an accident, it didn't mean anything, it was just sex, it was a mistake, he was so confused and hurting. \n\nDear new girlfriend, I wonder if he told you that you are different than anyone else he has ever met yet. How maybe some divine mystical power has brought you together. How it was always just meant to be. I remember when he told me that I was absolutely perfect and how he had never felt 'this' way about anyone else before. I remember when he told me that clearly he never knew how to love before me. I remember him telling me how special I was.\n\nDear, new girlfriend, do you remember how it started? I'll bet he was super charming with that smoldering gaze he possesses...I'll bet he held doors open for you and complimented everything you did. I bet he made you feel safe and endeared himself to you by telling you how badly he had been hurt in past relationships. 'I never connected with anyone the way I connect with you....this is magical' My ex and I just didn't work out, she left me when I needed her most.\n\nDear new girlfriend, have you noticed things have been off lately? Now that a few months have gone by, your honey moon stage is at its end. Have you had a a major fight yet? Did he leave you in tears? I remember our first fight....where are you? I haven't heard from you in five minutes....why were you talking to your long time ' male' friend....I don't trust him, he just wants to get in your pants. As a matter of fact all of your make friends just want to sleep with you. Why are you making me question your motives? You are trying to cheat on me. Why are you late from work? You were sleeping with someone else weren't you? \n\nDear new girlfriend, do you remember making up after that fight that left you in tears? I know you defended yourself. I know you tried to speak reasonably. I know you brought of valid points that made perfect sense and I know you spoke the truth. I know he didn't stop picking you apart until his anger ran it's course. I remember making up after our first arguement...'baby, I'm so sorry. I'm just so afraid you will leave me. You are so wonderful and I am so afraid of losing you. I don't know what you see in me. I won't do it again, I'll work on it. Please baby, I love you and we are meant to be together. It's just you and me. Our own little world. Our own little realm, it's everyone else that will destroy us. Please baby, don't let them do that. \n\nDear new girlfriend do you remember the day you woke up and realized you didn't have any personal freedom? Have you reached that point yet? I remember when I woke up and started typing emotional abuse into the search engine. I remember reading about isolation tactics. I realized that every minute of my day from start to finish had to be accounted for. After he left for work I had to text him while drinking my morning coffee. I remember him having convinced me that for the sake of our relationship I had to deactivate my social media. I remember dreading male customers at work because if he showed up and saw me talking to them on a professional level there was going to be hell to pay when I got home. If work ran late I knew I was going to be greeted with a venemous game of twenty questions. I remember that aside from going to work that the rest of the time I spent was with him. From mornjng until night in our own little world. I remember asking him if I could go see a movie with my gal pal. I remember him trying to talk me out of it until the point he said he would just sit in the back of the theater. \n\nwalwawalDear new girlfriend, have you settledinto his routine yet? Are you the perfect housewife yet? I bet you wake up in the morning and try to make him breakfast or atleast pack his lunch. I bet you pull something out of the freezer for the dinner you have been planning for two days. As a matter of fact I bet you spend your free time thinking of recipes and planning meals to keep your man happy. I remember trying to compete with the wonderful things his exes did int though it was 'over and done with'. I remember trying to show him in every way that I was the perfect one for him. I bet in walk intoinintoi. I bet you come home after a long days work and immediately fold your clothes and do the dishes because out of all the house hold chores he has told you that he hates doing dishes. I bet you that you make a fantastic meal and he compliments you on it. I bet you beam from ear to ear as you watch your Netflix. Don't forget the paper towels and make sure the next time you are in the kitchen you ask him if he wants another beer. I bet you cuddle on the couch and pray you don't receive a cell notification. I bet that your stomach churns when you do. I bet you pray it is just one of your gal friends. I remember the fear I had when he would make me hand him my phone so he could go through my messages.\n\nDear new girlfriend, I hope you know it only gets worse from here. Soon, there will be fight he starts over nothing and nothing you can do or say will make him happy. Have you seen his eyes yet? I remember the first time I looked in his eyes and didn't see anything recognizable. I remember that those blue eyes turn into unfathomable pits of black. I remember being scared of him. I remember trying to defend myself and diffuse the situation. I remember sitting in a corner at three a.m. sobbing while he continued to yell at me and throw things and accuse me of cheating. I remember my mind telling my heart it was stupid and that I needed to leave in the morning.\n\nDear new girlfriend, have you experienced the next morning yet? The next morning where your eyes are almost swollen shut from crying? I remember waking up and crying again. I remember being exhausted. I remember him coming and wrapoing his arms around me and apologizing with tears in his eyes. I bet you he promises that he will quit drinking. I bet you that he will tell you how sorry he is and that it's because he had too much to drink. I bet you he tells you its because he is so stressed at work and that he is worried about finances. I bet you he tells you it's because he haemtes that you have to work. He is a man after all? Shouldn't he be able to support you because you are so wonderful and deserve it? I bet he tells you how much he hates your job and the type of exposure you have to other people. I bet he tells you it's because he is afraid you are going to cheat on him because you deserve better.\n\nDear new girlfriend, I bet you comfort him. I bet that the sincerity of his words washes away the terror you felt the night before. I bet you miss and cuddle and make love too. I bet you convince yourself to believe him and tell him that it needs to never happen again. I bet you he promises it won't. I bet the next few weeks are absolute bliss. I bet you are both laughing and smiling and dancing in the living room to the country songs on the radio. I bet you think he has changed because he loves you so much. \n\nDear new girl friend......it's only a matter of time. Has he let slip any of his past transgressions yet? When you see me in public does he tell you that things ended badly and that I have a problem with him? Does he seem to purposely do business at my work or have errands to run nearby? Does he try to tell you that I am bitter and jealous and clearly want him? I remember when he would take me to an ex lovers place of business and how he would revel in how uncomfortable she was when she happened to happen to deal with us. I remember thinking, that's right wh\\*\\*e I am better than you. I won, he is mine. I remember when I had finally gotten away from him and shr approached me, ' she said I used to be jealous that you actually got to have relationship with him but now I feel sorry for everything you went through.' I remember finding out he had a secret relationship with her while with another woman. I remember he always told me he had no desire for her. I remember him telling me how badly she wanted him. I remember him telling me how they only ever hung out. I remember being sick when I found out the truth of it all. \n\nDear new girlfriend, I hope you realize that you have to keep tabs on him from cheating. You have to account for every minute of his day other wise that half hour where he left work early he was in the arms of another woman. He will almost give him self away with his strange behavior. Have you found his hidden albums of conquests and trophies in his phone yet? Make sure that if you find them, you dont mention them otherwise there will be hell to pay. \n\nDear new girlfriend, I promise it only gets worse. I promise that there is nothing you can do to change him. I promise  that I am not bitter and I promise that I do not want him. I promise that the only thing I want is for him to stay far away from me. \n\nDear new girlfriend, I bet he tells you that all those country songs were obviously written about the type of love you share.....I could give you a list of country songs that were about him and I....but i won't\n\narounwitDear new girlfriend, this is what you don't know ....I keep tabs on him and you. I keep tabs foHmy safety and I keep tabs because I am shim on worried about you. Right now you think you hate me and that  am a threat. I promise I am not. What you didn't know is that he came so close to killing me. What you don't know is that I crian d myself to sleep every night wondering what else I could have done to be perfect....to keep him from terrorizing me, to keep hihim from cheating on me.....what you don't know is that he stalked me for months after I left. Hwhat you don't know is that he was stringing along and being intimate with three to four other women as he employed his tactics to get me back. What you don't know is that I have PTSD from the night I left. You don't know that when I happen to run into him....or he purposely comes around that i wait until he is gone before I have aan anxiety attack. What you don't know is that I slept with e........what you don't know is that I was so close to filing a restraining order after I left but that I changed my mind because I refused to be afraid of him an you more. What you don't know is that I slept with a loaded .45 strapped to my bed post every night for four months after I left. What you don't know is that I nearly shot him when he walked into my home and stood staring at me. I was another second from grabbing my gun and aiming it at him. What you don't know is that he followed me around. He called my work from blocked numbers. He terrorized me after the fact and he didn't leave me alone until after he moved you in.....he still comes around d\n\nDear new girlfriend.....i don't hate you and I don't want him. I pray for both of you every night. I pray for your safety and I pray that he is a changed man so he won't hurt you.  I pray that you leave before it escalates to what I experienced. I pray that you are happy. I pray that if he does to you what he does to me that you will reach out to me so I can help you. I pray that I can help you navigate the aftermath and that maybe together we can stop him from doing this to any other woman. I pray that if he hasn't changed that we become dear friends. I pray . I pray for you and I won't ever stop.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I did not want this dog and told him it wasn\u2019t a good fit for our family. He left me home with him and our babies all the time, he didn\u2019t give the dog any attention, so naturally it got wild. I would try to work with him, but as a new mom it was so hard to deal with a giant dog knocking the babies down, chewing everything up, peeing and pooping everywhere. It would bark all day, knocked down the fence on both sides, and started becoming aggressive with the children. After two years of ME trying to work with the dog (while pregnant with two very young children while my husband went to the bar 3 nights a week), we ended up having to rehome him. My husband made me do it and I was heartbroken and cried all week. I found a home for him and I knew it was the right thing for him since he was not getting the attention he desperately needed.\n\nMy narc husband resents me for it and I realize I might get some side eye for even thinking about another animal after rehoming one. I know it\u2019s not the right time right now but I was just wanting to see if there was anyone else that had ever been in a similar position. He says he will \u201cnever ever own another dog or any kind of animal again. Maybe when the kids move out\u201d. \n\nI love animals and it makes me so so sad to imagine never being able to have another pet, and him never letting my children have the chance to grow up with a dog. He says the only dog he would ever get would be a pit bull or a German Shepherd. He knows I am not comfortable with big dogs so I think that\u2019s why he said it...he even says no fish to my 8 year old who has been obsessed with fish since he was a baby \ud83d\ude15 it\u2019s ridiculous that it feels like my parent telling me no..he never makes decisions WITH me, it\u2019s always him telling me what is going to happen.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Sure we\u2019ve had our difficulties, but I\u2019ve always wanted this relationship so badly. I\u2019ve given him all of myself, he told me he was committed multiple times but now he\u2019s leaving because he\u2019s been unhappy. He didn\u2019t try to work out a plan with me first, he never has. I knew he wasn\u2019t happy in life but I figured it was because of other factors, based on what he would express to me, (edit: he would express his dissatisfaction in our relationship during fights only, I don\u2019t remember him trying to approach me about it during calm, peaceful stages). Now he\u2019s flipped like a light switch and is completely dumping me after 5 years.\n\nI\u2019m fucking devastated and I cannot stop begging him to stay. He gets angry with me when I try to talk to him, I tell him we can figure this out we can figure out how to help him be happier. He doesn\u2019t want to work together, he wants to bail instead. I simply can\u2019t bear this, I\u2019m in love with him. I want him in my future. I\u2019m his biggest fan, I encourage him to do the things that would make him feel fulfilled, I always have. Why is he doing this??? I am beyond devastated, all I can do is cry and wail on the floor and he won\u2019t even look at me. He yelled at me instead for allowing my emotions to snowball into hysteria and wasting his time. \n\nI\u2019m quite literally hysterical, desperate, I love him so much. I love him for his talents and abilities, I love how he balances out my qualities. But I don\u2019t love how he treats me. He makes me feel like such garbage. I end up blaming myself for all of this, how can I not?? Despite all of my good intentions and despite all of my attempts to be his biggest supporter, I still wasn\u2019t good enough. He would say all these things to me to make me believe he thought of us having a future, now suddenly he tells me there\u2019s nothing for us, he\u2019s told me multiple times he wouldn\u2019t want me as the mother of his future children. I can\u2019t put into words, the pain. I\u2019m crippled by heartbreak. I keep trying to get him to come around, give us another chance, spell out what he needs and give it to him. He only tells me he needs to not be in a relationship; I can\u2019t wrap my head around this because he loved me just a few weeks ago.... I\u2019m shattered.\n\nEdit: (additional information) he discounts all the good times we\u2019ve had and only focuses on the bad. Everything seems to come back to me and how I couldn\u2019t give him what he needs. In reality, I\u2019m prepared to give him ANYTHING he could possibly need (except letting him leave me I guess...) He has painted this horrible, oppressive image of me, I\u2019m his ball and chain essentially. Yet, I\u2019ve stood by while he leaves for months at a time to travel, I encourage him to search for his goals and make moves towards them, I listen to him tell me what he wants and I try to talk to him about ways he can get what he wants. I stood by him after he cheated on me twice and then dumped me 2 years ago. He came back after I expressed how much he means to me, but not before another month long trip abroad. He faults me for not dropping everything to travel with him, it sucks because we were just about to plan a trip for early next year. I was so excited to finally do this with him. He never tried to work with me to make me comfortable, otherwise we\u2019d have gone on trips abroad by now. I like to plan those sorts of things, he would just buy a one way ticket on a whim.

Bar none.", "author": "Back2Reality222", "self_text": "I came across the following article some time ago. It's by Courtney Anne Pierce.\n\nReading it was for me the biggest light bulb moment in all the months I had spent trying to make sense of what had just happened to me. I showed it to a friend at the time and both of us were audibly gasping as we read it. It could have been written about me and for me.\n\nAny male out there who has been discarded by a female narcissist may, I believe, find it extremely interesting:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany people think of men when it comes to narcissism. And believe me there are plenty of men that do suffer from this personality disorder.\n\n**But there are also plenty of covert narcissists out there that are women.** I\u2019m going to address this question as it pertains to women narcissists. **I have a special place in my heart for men who\u2019ve dealt with these women because I know they\u2019ve been put through the ringer**, especially those who have children with these women.\n\nThese men tend to experience depression and/or anxiety. They may be hyper-vigilant, and often suffer from some sort of PTSD, depending on the length of the relationship. They also tend to be under-earners, and may have a history of narcissism abuse from childhood. Narcissism abuse is a debilitating experience. It\u2019s insidious and with women it can be subtle until it isn\u2019t anymore. If you happen to be divorcing a narcissist I strongly suggest the book: \u201cWill I Ever Be Free of You?\u201d by Karyl McBride (to start.)\n\n**Breaking up with a woman covert narcissist is a bit trickier.** This is in no way a comprehensive list, but in using your own experience you may find some things that resonate, or that you\u2019ve witnessed yourself.\n\n**1.) Cold; torturing; temper tantrums.**\n\n*She\u2019s breaking up with you:* Most likely, like her male counterpart, she already has another relationship she\u2019s moving into. So now she\u2019s just cold. You love her so much and will do anything to keep the relationship together because let\u2019s say you have a history or kids together. She\u2019s laughing at you, belittling you, and treating you like you\u2019re pathetic.\n\n*You\u2019re breaking up with her:* Temper tantrums, name calling, abuse, throwing things, quiet rage, controlling you, constant texts, phone calls, emails, threatens suicide. These are some of the experiences that can surface if you take that brave step of leaving a woman who doesn\u2019t truly know how to love. She\u2019s like a wounded, hungry animal and she\u2019ll do just about anything to get her food back.\n\n**2.) Controlling how it will end.**\n\n*She\u2019s breaking up with you:* If you share a home together, you\u2019re the one who needs to move out. She\u2019s not budging. If you don\u2019t have a home together, you only get to talk to her when she wants to. And she will want to talk occasionally, when she\u2019s sad or lonely, usually around the nighttime. Clearly her new source fell through, even if it was just for a night, so she needs you now.\n\n*You\u2019re breaking up with her:* You share a home together, and she\u2019s thrown all of your stuff into the trash, or some equivalent of it. She\u2019s going through your stuff and she\u2019s taking everything she believes belongs to her, including gifts she may have given you, etc. She\u2019s hiding important things from you that you need, like your lap top, car keys, etc\u2026\n\nYou don\u2019t live together, so she\u2019s calling all of her friends and telling them how awful and abusive you are. She\u2019s spreading lies about you. Maybe she\u2019s driving by your house at night. Maybe she keys your car.\n\n**3.) It\u2019s all your fault, manipulation.**\n\n*She\u2019s breaking up with you:* She needs to find fault and blame with everyone and everything, and she never takes responsibility for her own behaviors. She\u2019s incapable of seeing her part in any of the relationship, or how it ends. So it\u2019s all your fault and you\u2019re to blame for the end of the relationship. She\u2019ll make this known to you however she can. I.E. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have had to look outside of our marriage if you had given me more attention.\u201d \u201cYou never paid attention to me. So now I\u2019m going to someone who will.\u201d\n\n*You\u2019re breaking up with her:* She\u2019ll vacillate between mock sweetness and covert criticism. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you for wanting to end the relationship. I know it hasn\u2019t been perfect. But it\u2019s been really difficult being with you too. You\u2019re always late for things. I\u2019ve been so patient with you and this is how you\u2019re treating me now? It just feels like you\u2019re so ungrateful. You should really work on trying to seeing the blessings in your life. I just want to help you. Let\u2019s do this together.\u201d\n\n**4.) Triangulation.**\n\n*She\u2019s breaking up with you:* She has a few key players she\u2019ll involve in the end of the relationship to support her in her decision. They\u2019re usually people you thought you could trust and you believed really liked you. Don\u2019t worry, she\u2019ll let you know who these people are by saying something like, \u201cWell, Jane and her husband think I\u2019m doing the right thing. They told me I\u2019m too good for you. And I agree.\u201d Or she may pull in a therapist or professional. It would sound something like, \u201cEven my therapist thinks you\u2019re bad for me.\u201d\n\n*You\u2019re breaking up with her:* Same scenario different wording. \u201cWell, Jane and her husband think you\u2019re making a big mistake. They think I\u2019m the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to you. They don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happened to you. They\u2019re really worried about you. Are you ok?\u201d Or \u201cMy therapist thinks you\u2019re behaving unreasonable. This is normal healthy relationship issues. You just don\u2019t want to work them out. That\u2019s on you.\u201d\n\n**5.) Accusations and Projections.**\n\n*She\u2019s breaking up with you:* At some point there\u2019ll be a little bit of a war. Women narcissists don\u2019t let go easily even when they\u2019re the ones leaving. They\u2019ll need to get a few digs in before they go. They\u2019re often accusations, which tend to be forms of projections, meaning they hurl statements towards you that really pertain to them, though they don\u2019t know it. I.E. \u201cYou\u2019re abusive! You\u2019ve been traumatizing me for years!\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t care about me or anyone else. It\u2019s always all about you!\u201d\n\nPlease note, people who have been traumatized rarely have the ability to clearly state, \u201cI\u2019ve been traumatized.\u201d Because they\u2019ve been traumatized, which can take years to fully process and express.\n\n*You\u2019re breaking up with her:* \u201cYou probably already have another girlfriend. That\u2019s so typical!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re so ungrateful. You\u2019ve treated me terribly over the years and after all I\u2019ve done for you! This is how you\u2019re treating me!\u201d\n\n**6.) Undermining of your identity and sense of self.**\n\n*Regardless of who\u2019s leaving who:* Women narcissists will undermine their men especially, but really anyone around them at any given time. They can do this many ways, and by behaving as if they\u2019re superior in some field or area of knowledge, even if the knowledge is parenting.\n\nFor example a woman who has some background in the mental health field may say something like, \u201cI\u2019m worried about your mental health. You\u2019re acting paranoid. You\u2019re delusional.\u201d Or she may say something like, \u201cI\u2019m really worried about. You\u2019re not acting sane right now.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to parenting they\u2019ll undermine the father\u2019s role and importance regardless of real-world evidence that most oftentimes he\u2019s been the primary care giver of the children and the most involved in the children\u2019s lives.\n\nUltimately the victim of this abuse can begin questioning himself or herself promoting insecurity, self-doubt, and doubting of his or her own sense of self, who he or she really is in truth.\n\n**7.) Pity and sympathy.**\n\nEventually things die down and they play their last card: pity and sympathy.\n\n*If she\u2019s leaving you:* \u201cYou have no idea how hard this has been on me. It\u2019s so sad that it comes to this. Please just leave me alone so I can get some sanity back in my life. If you really cared about me none of this would have ever happened.\u201d\n\n*If you\u2019re leaving her:* \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do without you. You\u2019ve taken everything from me. I might as well give up on relationships forever. You\u2019ve killed my Soul.\u201d\n\n**Please note that let\u2019s say, 99% of all relationships with a narcissists will include a period of time when they\u2019ll try to come back and make sure they still have their hold on you. This includes women narcissists as well.**\n\n**The time in between may be a few days, a few months, or even a few years.

For instance, he said if either my sister or I were to get a white boyfriend he would kill the boyfriend and us.\n\u2022He was one of those people who thought the world was ending, and we weren't allowed to watch movies that were historically supposed to have black actors. Like The Mummy, for example.\n\u2022He always makes everything about him. I had a scholarship interview, but I knew our car was messed up, so I asked a friend who was also going if she wouldn't mind taking me too. I told my dad about it and he flipped out because I didn't think of our transportation issue, and parents are supposed to take their children to stuff like that. He also thought I purposely moved the interview date to a weekday so that he wouldn't be able to take me. (I never did that). i ended up missing the interview, and later on (few weeks later), he said he's mad because I should've been able to go, but the car was messed up so there was no other way to get me there (like I didn't suggest letting my friend take me).\n\u2022He pushes family away because he can't trust them, and he says he's the only one who's going to truly love my sister and I. He basically says we can't trust them. This past month, my family came over, and he was yelling at them about things that happened six or seven years ago. He made me go out there and tell them that everything he was saying was true\n\u2022He's a hypocrite. He'll tell my sister and I not to do something, but he does it anyway. He tells us not to eat in our room, but he eats in his room everyday.\n\u2022He guilt trips us. Once, he left food on the counter, and my cat got into it. He yelled at us about it the next day, saying we should've covered his food. He was threatening physical violence if we ever told anyone that he treats us badly.\n\u2022My sister has generalized anxiety disorder and depression from him. He was verbally abusing her because she didn't get a full-time to college, even though he knows she has depression. He thinks the music she listens to is to blame because he said he knows he better not be the reason why she's depressed. Now that it's my senior year in high school, I'm afraid of what he'll do when he finds out I haven't been getting enough scholarships. He also used one of the only scholarships I got last year to pay my sister's tuition without either of us knowing. I just received another one, and the banquet is next month, but I'm not telling him about it for that reason.\n\u2022His pride doesn't allow other people to help him, and he gets mad when people don't help him. He still hasn't paid my graduation dues because he can't afford it, even after my uncle offered to pay for at least half of it.\n\nThis doesn't happen every day. It's a cycle of him being good and him beating down on us, and we never know what will trigger his behaviors. We have to plan out everything we tell him, even if it's \"Dad we need more tissue\" because we're so afraid of him.\nI want to leave right after graduation, but I'm really at a lost as to where I should go. I only need somewhere to stay for the summer, since I'll be living on campus in August.

I must admit, his words still hurt me. But I know better now. I am able to see through his words and fully understand his tactics in them. I have cut and paste his passages from his emails. I'd also like to mention that this is him in his best behavior. If he knew he had me he would be calling me a cheater, a succubus incarnate, a wench etc. etc. But he is behaving himself because he is still trying to get me to go back to him. \n\nFor some background context. I've been living on my own for many many years now. Have been completely dependent on solely myself and have no outside help from others. I pay all of my bills and live a sustainable life on my own. I was never able to attend college or finish it. Because it simply wasn't possible for me to live on my own AND pay for myself to go to school.\n\nHe on the other hand has never had to pay a single bill himself. He is still dependent on his parents. Was given a brand new car that is paid for under his name by his parents. He isn't even required to pay for his traffic violation tickets himself. He is living the kind of lifestyle I left behind 10 years ago. Down in the passage he mentions 7 years because that's how long we've technically been dating. Somehow he \"forgets\" I was self sufficient before him. When I first met him he had no license, was on probation and didn't have a job. I had to drive him everywhere. Me and his parents urged him to make a decision to turn his life around and his parents ended up paying for him to attend a really great program in college that will make him a nice and cozy salary in the long run. He has worked hard during it and I always supported him, reminding him of how privileged and lucky he is to have this opportunity because some people just don't have the same luxuries and help to get that far. Pointing out that yes, he worked hard but he was also given this opportunity so he should take advantage of it instead of hating it. All he did was complain about his lifestyle while away at college. About how he can't do anything like hangout with friends (every adult has to give up partying sometimes), has to spend his money on food and supplies (every adult has to do this) and has to stay up all night working when he could be sleeping. I tried to ensure him it would all be worth it in the ene, every chance I had. Was ALWAYS supportive and there for him. And always there to remind him how lucky he is so he could be grateful. \n\nI am very proud of the life I had made for myself. It was not easy when you don't have anyone to help you even to get a leg up. Especially since I have been through particularly hard times in my life when I've had to choose putting gas in my car over eating. Or choose living in a place with no kitchen over moving out of the area because rent is too high. I'd also like to mention that I am in resturaunt management. And have been for sometime. I used to be a full time manager but when I moved out of the area and to a more affordable outside of the city, I decided to be a part time manager and decided to take up serving and bartending to bring in the extra cash. It works out really well for me and I thoroughly enjoy my job and the people I work with. I also make the same amount of money that I did in the city only I pay half the rent I used to pay. I am set to be working with the state shortly that will be giving me full benefits package and a pension plan. I am hoping to go back to school at some point, but again, these kinds of things take time to plan and save for as I do not have people paying a single thing for me. \n\nI am telling you guys all of this background information so you will be able to clearly see where the projection is, where the lies are and where the manipulation is. \n\nOne more piece of background information is that he did the basic narc thing. Made me adopt his lifestyle. With his friends and his family. Then pulled the triangulation with all of them on me. I was always upset that he never made any strides to know my family or know my friends and recently told him that if he didn't make any efforts to merge our life together it would be over. He responded by discarding me and personally leaving me out of personal and important life events that I used to be a part of in his life, back before I stood up for myself and knew what narcissism was. \n\n\"I'm the one actually making whatever \"life\" was possible, possible. The whole time, what have you done to make that life possible? Just grab the first waitressing job you can find. That's not building a life. That's wasting one. You can't afford an adult life when you're still where you were 7 years ago. You have taken no steps. You have taken 0 responsibility for crafting that life. This is not me doubling back. This is me telling you, that you really need to grow up with your blame games and your bluffing and your jealousy and spite and secrets. Or dont. Wont be any skin off my nose.\"\n\n\"*****, I've already spent weeks explaining this to you. I literally don't have time for this. I am writing, producing, applying for grants, casting, shooting and editing a feature length film. I am editing 4 different music videos. All while working/commuting 14 hours a day. Go back and reread if you're still confused. I'm not repeating myself.\"\n\n\"Yeah and by that you mean for me to completely ditch my own life and attach myself to YOURS. Which is living in the middle of bumblefuck with a shitty job that can't support a single person let alone a family. Meanwhile, over here in society, I am making 80k/year,\u00a0setting up to be able to afford a family and a home. I have made plenty of attempts to merge our lives. I set out to create a situation where we could build a life together, and I have successfully completed that task. I have laid more than enough ground work. You haven't\u00a0made a single effort to merge lives. The fact that you're labeling me as the problem of why we are not closer is a literal fucking joke and truly makes me question your sanity and intentions. You also don't give a flying fuck about me, my family, my happiness, my health, my goals and aspirations, my hobbies and interests. Based on your behavior, you'd file for divorse the second I pissed you off, which by the way, is fucking impossible to avoid because you're so self-righteous that whenever something doesn't go exactly your way, it is automatically wrong. You have no tolerance or patience or understanding or compassion. You've given me nothing to WANT to merge with. You've given me nothing to love. All you've shown is that you're just an extremely risky investment with a minimal gain. I wish it were different, but I can't change anything other than myself.\"\n\nI'd also like to mention that he is not actually making 80k a year. That is a blatant lie. Last I checked the company who he was INTERNING for didn't even have him in the payroll system and he was not receiving paychecks yet. He doesn't pay for a single thing himself and he still believes that if he doesn't pay his traffic tickets it will effect his credit score. \n\nBut this is how a narc talks to us. Blame, blame, blame. Playing the \"you\" game. Raging. Talking about how horrible I am. \n\nThen he'll send me messages like this\n\n\"I am just so deeply fucking dissapointed in all of this. You were my only goal for so so so long. Why would you pretend that you wanted to get married and have kids, when you don't give a single shit about me? When you never actually wanted to? What was the purpose of toying with me like that, the purpose of putting me through all of depression and heartache?\"", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The thing is that my experience was 8 years ago but I still feel like it\u2019s not giving me any rest, probably because the first few years I tried to forget everything. \n\nMy experience started when I was around 12. My family would live with my aunt\u2019s family in one house, we were very close. However, when I was 12 my family moved because my dad got a better job. We still visited every month because we are really close to them, one of the three cousins is my best friend that I couldn\u2019t live without. \nThe thing is that in that time my puberty started. Every time we came and I was hanging out with my favorite cousin, my older cousin would come and say that he wanted to talk to me about something. I always went with him even though I knew what would follow. I scream at my past self now that I never refused but he had some kind of power over me. We would get to his room and he would always look the door and put the key on his big wardrobe where I\u2019m not able to reach it. After a little bit of small talk he would always start asking me if my breast got bigger, if he could see them. I always refused. He kept nagging and discussing that he would really like to see them and that they are so beautiful I have to show him. This discussion would always go on for several minutes until I had enough and wanted it to be over. I always ended up saying yes to I could go away. After a few months, it didn\u2019t just result in him seeing my breasts but also him doing other stuff with them (hands and mouth). I never liked it and told him no but he would always lock the door and kept discussing, making me feel stupid and wanting it to just be over. \n\nAfter a year of the repeated incidents, he started wanting to touch me down there, again I would refuse but he always won. I always went with him when he asked me to, I never wanted to make him angry. I guess I always complied because I had this tendency to want to be liked by everyone. It would even get to the point where he wanted to only put his tip in. Thankfully, I was able to get my way here because I knew he wouldn\u2019t stop there. However, he blamed me for being hard and told me to instead put his penis in my mouth. Again, I said I didn\u2019t want to and that I never did that before (I was 14 then). Still, he kept pushing me until I knew I was getting away faster by just doing what I was told. I always felt uncomfortable in this discussion, I just wanted to leave and thought this was the only way. I did what he asked but didn\u2019t like it so I stopped. He told me I can\u2019t stop now, he already feels like he\u2019s coming and I said that I didn\u2019t want to that I don\u2019t like it. We \u2018agreed\u2019 that I could continue with my hand. Afterwards I was finally allowed to leave. \n\nThankfully that incident was the worst one that I remember. I never liked it, just wanted it to be over but went with him anyway every time. I partly blame myself for not being stronger to tell him off. When I told my friends at 14, they just laughed at me even the boy I liked at that time (I guess they didn\u2019t know how to react or thought I was a joke, I don\u2019t blame them). I only told two other people what happened and only recently. \nWhen I was 15, he again wanted to talk and I went with him. This time however, he apologized and said he wouldn\u2019t do it again. I said that it was fine, that is was no problem. At that time I always acted like nothing could shatter me and that I didn\u2019t care about anything. We never talked about it again.\n\nNow for two years, I started remembering these moments. Before I always shoved the memories away because I couldn\u2019t tell anyone, especially my parents. I was afraid we were never going back to my aunt\u2019s family again but I wanted to see my favorite cousin even if it meant facing his older brother. Even now, I won\u2019t tell my parents what happened. \nLooking back I realized that there has always been a rivalry and a game of power between the two brother, I guess I was part of that game. We still meet with the family a few times a year, we get along pretty well and the older cousin has changed now, growing more responsible and less power hungry. I don\u2019t really blame him for what happened, he was young then as I was. But I don\u2019t want to blame myself which is why I\u2018m not sure where to put my anger. I like him and don\u2019t associate the person he is now with who he was back then. \n\nI\u2018m just not sure what to do. I still feel like what happened has a big impact on me even if it\u2019s a while back. Somehow, I\u2019m still not able to come close to men or trust them, I wasn\u2019t able to since it happened. I guess the cause could be something like else... Maybe I\u2018m also trying to make the incident smaller so I don\u2019t feel conflicted anymore. I know some people had it worse but I still feel like this is bothering me. I don\u2019t have the time or money to go to therapy and I don\u2019t feel like talking to someone else about it and looking vulnerable. What should I do?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

They also seemed to have more of a cloud of depression rather than full blown NPD.

Additionally, while I have indeed moved on in terms of my living my best life.

Even going as far as to say that they are getting treatment/being medicated for their \u201cissues.\u201d Yet when I inquired about the name of the treatment facility and medication they were taking, they seemingly were unable to tell me either one.

I don\u2019t even really know what\u2019s going on in my situation. I feel like everything has been turned upside-down and I have no clue what\u2019s true and what\u2019s not anymore. Can anyone please give me insight? I just need some objectivity now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (25m) feel like I\u2019m never enough for my girlfriend (26f). We\u2019ve been together for nearly 4 years (next month). Things feel really off to me, but I can\u2019t put my finger on it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe met in college and early on, my girlfriend pointed out to me that I had a harmful relationship with my (52f) mother. I\u2019m pretty sure this is actually the truth and the relationship with her is/was certainly a bit co-dependent. I think I suffered a bit because of this and for a time, I was definitely a little \u201cdevelopmentally behind\u201d I guess you could say. I lacked a lot of life skills. Over time, my girlfriend pushed me to change these things about myself by threatening to break up with me if I couldn\u2019t manage to do so. I tried to do a lot of reflection and made a ton of changes. Later on, she eventually started to make jokes at my expense saying that I was autistic, or that I wanted to have sex with my mom or that she was my girlfriend. I understand that she was joking, and I get that there was probably a lot of frustration on her end, but the remarks would hurt my feelings. I did sometimes express that too, but she often told me that I was being sensitive or that if I behaved differently, she wouldn\u2019t feel frustrated and lash out in that way. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter college, we went back to our hometowns, and were briefly in a LDR until I eventually moved in with her and her mother after finding an internship in her city (as a side note, during this entire period of time I was contributing to her mom\u2019s rent). Eventually I got a full-time job, but the whole time I lived with them, my GF would constantly complain that I didn\u2019t do enough around the house. Admittedly, I was still somewhat in \u201ccollege mode,\u201d so I tried to be more conscientious, but I *do* admit I wasn\u2019t perfect. Not too long after I landed that job, I started looking for my own apartment because I didn\u2019t want to live at her mom\u2019s forever, and my girlfriend was on board because she thought it would be good life experience for me to live on my own. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout all of this, I started to notice more concerning behavior come up. During this time, I noticed that she never seemed to want to just coexist with one another, it seemed like she always wanted intense 1-on-1 time, to the point where I felt like she\u2019d get angry if I wasn\u2019t paying attention to her. One such example is that I would often meditate in the mornings for 15 minutes max. She knew that I would do that, and though she said she was okay with it, she\u2019d ask to sit in the room with me, or she\u2019d interrupt me because I had left her by herself. She would also start tickling me (I\u2019m extremely ticklish) and would do so even after I asked her to stop or after I told her I didn\u2019t want to be tickled. Over time, I\u2019ve watched as this has progressed from tickling for fun to tickling me when I make a lame joke, to now hitting me (not hard although it has hurt before)/tickling me when I say something she might not like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, during my apartment hunt, things became more tense and my GF basically strongly recommended that I go to therapy or else our relationship wouldn\u2019t work out. I did that, and it was really eye opening, but she has always been critical of my therapist, saying that she\u2019s not helpful and that I\u2019m not focusing on the right things with her (she often asks me what I talk about during my sessions and I initially found it hard to not tell her). Around this time, I found my own place and right before I was going to move out, my GF told me she wanted to go on a break because she felt like I wasn\u2019t meeting her needs. \n\n \n\nRegardless, we were on a break for a month, and it was the most freeing time of my life and my self-confidence was up, but I was also extremely, extremely lonely. While I had all the time in the world to myself, I basically had no friends anymore aside from a handful who live out of town, and at the time, I had no family in the area either. I actually managed to live alone pretty well, and keep my place clean and nice, but I didn\u2019t have many people to talk to, so I was happy when we started talking again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTherapy had really helped me see that I have some legitimate communication issues and I tend to try really hard to please people, often at the expense of my boundaries. So when we started talking again, I tried to set boundaries and ask that we take things slow so we didn\u2019t end up in the same place, but almost instantly she rejected the idea and tried to take up all my free time (the weekend we got back together, she agreed to all-day outings on Saturday and Sunday without consulting me first). A lot of the previous behaviors such as the mean comments, hitting/tickling, and clinginess started to come back and at this point they're far more constant. Early on, I tried to be firm about sticking to my boundaries, but it always caused a fight, so I gave up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I barely spend time at the apartment I\u2019m paying for and I find myself using it almost more as a hotel or as a glorified storage locker while I spend up to 6 days a week at her mom\u2019s. 3 nights out of the week (Friday - Sunday) I often don\u2019t go home at all. I barely have time to do anything for myself and I\u2019ve become a wreck trying to schedule my hobbies and responsibilities around her demands for free time. She gets mad at me if I mention that I want to stay home to do laundry, for example. It\u2019s taking a huge toll on my mental health and I think it\u2019s made me quite resentful in this relationship. I know it\u2019s impacted me, and she\u2019s definitely noticed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most confusing thing about all of this, however, is that she\u2019s told me that I\u2019m abusive. Nowadays, she gives long lectures on how I\u2019m ruining our relationship, and she demands that I change how I am. I\u2019m not committed enough, I\u2019m not affectionate enough, etc. I tell her that I\u2019ll try to change because I *can* see that it's impacting her, but I feel like I always come up short. When I fail to change the way I am, she tells me that I\u2019m gaslighting her and, honestly, I have no idea if she\u2019s right. I feel like it's possible that I'm doing it without even realizing it. I know I feel resentment and frustration. And I know I want to get out of this relationship quite often (although I\u2019m scared to leave because I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have no one), but I\u2019m wondering now if I was the problem all along. I\u2019ve caught myself wondering if I\u2019ve been subtly manipulating my therapist about my situation, for example. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m being fully honest here. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m being as honest about the situation as anyone\u2019s bias will afford them, but I don\u2019t want to paint myself as a spotless victim when I know I have issues. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know\u2026 I think I just needed to vent. I\u2019m so confused and I don\u2019t know where to go. I sometimes think about how killing myself might be easier than dealing with all of this (it won\u2019t actually happen because I have a lot more I want to do in life) but the thought *does* come up. I worry that I might be actively abusing her. Part of me thinks that I'm being ridiculous, but even as I type all of this out, I still feel like I could be different. Things might be better between the two of us if I were. I don\u2019t know\u2026 \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks if you read this far, I guess.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

This is kinda important as in Scottish culture, it's really not that surprising to have a kid that young. I was a week late, and the only one of my siblings that weren't premature. I have a few problems; GAD, ADHD, Dyslexia. And that's what's diagnosed. My brother(15F) was very premature, 3 months premature. She smoked and (according to family members) took heavy drugs during both of our pregnancies. My brother suffered an overheat in his cot which caused mental issues such as; his learning age is 3-5 years behind, he has a lazy eye, a lisp, a very sensitive chest(inhaler required) and require weird walking boots. My sister is okay, she probably has undiagnosed ADHD but don't know for sure. My lil bro has a sensitive asphoegus? I think that's what it's called. He has to have thickened food because his stomach tube sometimes drowns his lungs in food.\n\n**Onto the abuse we've lived through:**\n\nMen came in and out of my life. CONSTANTLY. And they weren't your stand-up guy. Oh and, all my siblings are from different dads. Yeah. My dad lives 3 hours away my bro's(15M) dad died of a heart attack (alcohol related, go figure). My sisters dad abused me and my brother(15M) for the entire 6 years he and my mam were together. He also did it to her but I'll come back to that. He hated my brother for his disabilities, belittling him and blaming him for every family argument. Whenever my brother needed physical aid, he would manhandle him. Push him around and when he hurt him, he called him sensitive and told him to be quiet before my mam noticed.\n\nI was around 7/8 when they got together and around 14/15 when they split. They hid it for a while (for the kids! \u00ac~\u00ac) but their split really spiralled.\n\nMy mam would get drunk as all hell and disappear into the town for the whole night. (I did feel bad for my sister dad but only because he had to clean up her mess). I remember nights she'd lock him out, I'd watch her drink and fall every month or so. She had alcoholic friends who enabled her. One night she locked him out, he was begging to be let back in and she went to the kitchen and slit her wrists (with threes kids in the house) obviously not deep enough to hid the vein and then called her sister about her mistake. Not the last time she threatened to take her life. \n\nAfter multiple years of this broken record, we moved into his flat for the last 2 or so years. His abuse towards me got even worse. I sort out an abusive friend group in a way to rebel and because they were the only people to validate me. He never let me leave the house besides school. I had half an hour to get home from school each night or he'd punish me (remove my tablet) I was 13 and YouTube became a huge part of my mental coping strategy. Whenever this was removed, I'd have a full blown mental. Panic attacks, crying for hours until I fell asleep. He would force me to clean his flat, force me to empty his bin. Force me to do his shopping.\n\nHe came out as trans and forced me to tell my mam to accept him. This is when the comments started. I was a skinny child, I refused to eat due to my ADHD medication and was borderline anorexic. I was just hitting puberty and as a flat chested kid in comparison to girls my age, I was extremely self conscious. I remember coming out of the shower and coming to the kitchen, I had pants on, a croptop bra and a towel covering most of my torso. His comment was \"Wow, you're really coming into your hips, they're nice and your chest is trying to grow.\" Things only got worse. He would force me to watch him put on makeup, get my approval for his silicone pads for his bra, whenever we went shopping, he tried to get me to buy sexualised underwear for myself, tried to force me to be trans by saying I was really masculine. He would call me into his bedroom when he was barely dressed and forced me to watch as he talked to me about stuff that could have waited.\n\nI suffered a lot of gaslighting and mental abuse(too much to all include here) which has ruined me mentally. My anxiety has gone through the roof. My mam filed for a refuge house away from him and they've split.\n\nMy mam has been abusing alcohol for the 3/4 years we've lived in this house and it's recently spiked. In February of this year, I went into a deep depression to abuse vodka to the point I spiralled and nearly killed myself one night. Needless to say, I haven't touched it since. In the past couple months, my mam threatened to kill herself because she was a bad mother, my sisters dad got custody of her and that's where she is right now. My mother's alcoholism has run rampant and everytime I come home (around 6 most nights because I like to hang out with my bf) she's drunk. Or high. The house has been stinking of weed the past month and I caught her with it last Thursday.\n\nMy grandparents don't see this as their problem and blame me a lot for 'not caring' because I've mentally checked out and because I avoid the alcoholic conflict so much. Everytime there's an altercation, I leave the house. I have fled the house at least 3 times recently and it's just registering with me how bad my situation is right now. I'm in sixth form and I've given up on any aspirations I have for life. I just want an average life and to leave this miserable hellhole.\n\n\nI don't really know how to wrap this up but I just need some help. CPS is out of the question, she's evaded them so many times. And they have labelled me attention seeking. The child services in England are so bad that they will literally blame the children in order to not have another case on their hands.\n\nI just want to know how I can cope better with my situation. And this is nowhere near the full amount of information because it's hard to capture 17 years of abuse in one post but I can answer comments if people have any questions. \n\nTL;DR! : my mother is an alcoholic and a suspected drug abuser, neglects me and my siblings and damages our mental health.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Whatever the number, it is a lot.\n\nIt always happens over a seemingly small issue, like day to day stuff. Things that could be solved between two reasonable people with a 2 minute conversation. No arguments about money, sex, or values. She says at the time she loses control, isn't thinking about anything other than running away, and isn't able to stop the patterns of thought or control the anger causing them.

She lived away from the home for 2 or 3 weeks until she thought she could control herself, then we resumed things and it was good to begin with. She said it was a wake up call. It wasn't.\n\nSince then she was prescribed medication to help control her mood and anger, and started counseling. I said that threatening to end the relation was a non-negotiable, but that she didn't need to feel like she wasn't allowed to have bad days, get angry, or even yell and carry on. Just not threaten divorce. The meds were surprisingly effective, with no side effects according to her. She didn't find the counselor to be of any help. I've been as supportive as a can be. I've helped her make tools to help her rationalise her problems and decide an appropriate response. I've addressed trigger behaviour that I do that sets her off. I've been there to talk about stuff whenever she needs.\n\nShe has had two meltdowns since the wake up call one where she's started to pack her bags and said she was leaving. On the first occasion she had forgot her meds. Big fight, difficult reconciliation. Move on. Friday night she lost it over a logistical issue. That was the surface problem, but I found out later there were some sleep and parenting issues too. She had also not taken her meds for a week because she had forgotten again (blamed it on not responding to alarm straight away then forgot). I got told it is over. Again.\n\nI can't keep doing this. We've spoken about the possibility of a more serious underlying mental health issue that may be causing her to not remain in control even when she knows the consequences for me. Even if that turns out to be true, I'm having difficulty separating the way I've been treated from the cause. I'm not sure I can keep up the hope that it won't happen again because there is no evidence it won't Promises have been made and broken before. So I'm not sure what to do. Is my marriage over?\n\nTL;DR Wife has anger issues, seems to be a non-compiler with meds that help, threatens divorce, am sick of it.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It's kind of a wild story so bear with me. About five months ago, I met a guy at the climbing gym and we hit it off super hard right away. It was amazing chemistry, I genuinely felt like he was my soulmate. He was living in a minivan when we met but started staying at my place a lot and eventually moved in. He also proposed to me about two months in and i said yes because he seemed like this amazing, sweet, well-adjusted, intelligent guy who had done all these wild and exciting adventures. I was incredibly attracted to him in every way and we seemed super compatible. We had SO much fun together and I felt like I could talk to him about anything.  Honestly I felt like he was my best friend, and I was so so excited to be building a life together. I felt like I had finally found my true partner in life.\n\nAnyway we made a plan together to build out a cargo van and drive across the country bikepacking this winter, a mutual passion. We were going to make a documentary and a youtube channel. I funded everything because I made a lot more money, and also told him that he could stop working if he wanted to (he was driving for Uber) to focus on making videos, photography, etc -- his passions. I also gave him money for a new camera and computer that he said would be extremely helpful in doing this project together, about $5000 in total. I didn't mind doing any of that stuff or paying most of the bills because I felt that we were in a committed partnership and he did housework, took charge on building the van, etc. The van is in my name and I make the payments but obviously it belonged to both of us.\n\nAs the time approached for us to leave, we started to get in a few fights. He felt that I am too emotional/reactive, and I felt that he was unfairly critical of me at times and sometimes too mean/cold. However for the most part I thought we were able to talk about this stuff pretty objectively and come to mutually satisfying terms. I was still extremely happy, excited, and just like looking forward to this adventure. But then yesterday morning after I got home from taking our puppy to the vet, he confronted me about the fact that I am \"emotionally manipulative and abusive\" due to my emotional reactions. He said my reactions are designed to control him and manipulate him and he is \"sick of being abused\". He said that I lack the self awareness to understand what I am doing. But if I admit I have a problem and work on it, then he is willing to give me another chance because I \"do have a lot of good qualities\".\n\nThis blindsided me, and it REALLY upset me for a variety of reasons -- one because he didn't approach this in anything even resembling compassion, it was like I was suddenly a criminal and I was on trial. He said he sees me through a new lens now and therefore it didn't matter what I did -- if I cried, that was manipulative and designed to make him feel bad for me, etc. He also asked me to \"explain\" my emotional reactions (\"outbursts\") to an argument we'd recently had (I got frustrated, raised my voice, and ended up crying/ asking him to leave me alone) but I was not allowed to mention anything about his behavior or i was \"flipping the situation\" and \"projecting my emotions\" onto him, which is also abusive/ gaslighting. He said that my behavior yesterday revealed that I truly am a manipulative person and am abusing him.  I didn't know how he wanted me to explain my emotional reactions without talking about the situation that triggered them.  It was extremely confusing and painful.\n\nAlso for the record, I've been in emotionally abusive relationships in the past and I definitely wouldn't try to manipulate, control, or abuse a partner for any reason, at least not consciously. I attempt to communicate my feelings as directly as possible, and I consider myself a relatively self-aware person for the most part. I'm sure sometimes I am unconsciously manipulative but it's not something I'm doing chronically or something. He was abused badly as a child by his mom and is currently processing a lot of that trauma after years of repressing it and stuff and part of me wondered if he was like projecting that onto me or something? I have no idea. But anyway I got really upset, and increasingly more upset as he claimed that everything I said/did subsequently was further proof that I am manipulative/abusive. This culminated in me saying that we should break up, and then taking it back, because I realized that I didn't actually want to do that and was being reactive. So that was also abusive, and unacceptable behavior (which I do agree with, and I wish I hadn't said it.)\n\nAlso, in the middle of this happening, he asked me for a thousand dollars to pay his overdue bills. I felt really weird about it but gave it to him anyway. Anyway after all that I went home to stay with my parents for a night and really tried to reflect and think about whether or not I am actually abusive. I went through my recent journals trying to put myself in his shoes and understand how he might think I've been abusive. I also explained the situation to my family and my two closest friends and asked for their opinion on if I act manipulatively, because I figured if it is true, people that have known me my whole life would know it right? I didn't really want to do this because I didn't want them to start to dislike him but I also just really needed some objectivity. They all had the same reaction basically -- defending me, saying I am not abusive and he is the one manipulating me, and he is a freeloader that I need to dump ASAP. I did not want to like talk shit on him or make any decisions until I have all my facts and thoughts straight in my own head but I value their opinions highly. My parents also made me promise to put a stop payment on the check which I attempted to do last night and I'm not sure if it worked or not.\n\nSo today I decided I would just test the water with him and see where we stand, I planned to tell him that I want him to move out temporarily and give me some space to process all this and get my head straight. I also wanted to tell him that I put a stop payment on the check and explain why -- because I didn't feel comfortable giving this big sum of money when he is questioning whether or not he even wants to be with me. Well he took me wanting space as me breaking up with him again, and said that I am fucking him over by not giving him that money since his account will be overdrawn. He said that it's all just more manipulation. I think the check ended up going through anyway so he probably gets the thousand dollars regardless.\n\nI feel genuinely devastated by all this. I'm extremely confused and torn between just burning bridges and saying \"fuck this guy\" and hoping for some kind of reconciliation and that things can go back to how good they were before. It just feels like a total mindfuck nightmare. He moved out all his stuff, said he doesn't need me, that I showed my true colors to him in this situation, accused me again of controlling him financially and emotionally and said that I \"wouldn't let him work\" (not true) and that I am gaslighting/abusing him by not admitting what i'm doing wrong.\n\nI feel like I put everything I had into this relationship, emotionally and financially. I went from having a large amount of savings to only having about $3k to my name and now that we're basically splitting up I feel really naive and stupid about buying him those electronics and buying a fucking van and all this stuff. I also just really tried my best to be as kind, loving and accepting of a partner as I could possibly be. And I truly cannot figure out for the life of me if I was emotionally abusing him or not. Like I don't think I am manipulative or abusive but then why is he SO dead-set on saying that I am and staking our entire relationship/future on it?\n\nThanks for reading if you got this far, this felt good to get off my chest. would appreciate any advice/opinions.\n\n\\*tl;dr - live-in fiance suddenly decided that i am manipulative/abusive and I am feeling mind-fucked\\*", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I am currently engaged to someone who, I am beginning to suspect, is a covert narcissist and have recently started feeling uneasy about our relationship. Because this may be long, I will try to make this as readable as possible for you all.\n\nFor background:\n\n* I am 31 (M) and my fiance is 28 (F)\n* We have been in a relationship for four years (minus two months... more on this).\n* We have been engaged for four months.\n* We met in her home country and have been living in our country for the past three years.\n* Since we have moved back to my home country, we have both been attending college (I needed more than a humanities degree, and she needed credentials for this country).\n* It has been financially tight but steady; we both are/were making income on top of school.\n* I work about 90 hours between school, assignments, and work; my fiance isn't currently working, but is still putting in about 50 hours a week for school and assignments. We have not had much free time (if any), and we are pretty exhausted during said time.\n\nI mentioned the above because these could be the source of the issues (or at least exacerbating them). There are some things that don't sit quite right.\n\nIn the beginning, our relationship couldn't have been better really. We had a lot in common, had great conversation, and our sex life left nothing to be desired. I truly felt that I met my soul mate. After going on a small vacation to a beach-side town after few months into the relationship, she broke off the relationship. I was absolutely gutted but even worse was the confusion. She said that she needed to focus on school but it didn't sit right. I spent the next month repeating everything I did and said to see if there was something between to cause that reaction. I admittedly can be dense at times... but there was really no indication that this was going to happen. After two months, I sent a text to ask if she really felt the way she did... you can piece together the rest.\n\nThings were fine for the next few months. Everything was normal, if not great. She had gotten a working permit visa for my home country so we decided to try a year here. A week or two before we left is when the warning signs started to show (I say that with hindsight though, because I thought / partially think there was some justification). \n\nShe went through my email and noticed that I had sent a message to my ex-girlfriend (one of 7 years). The ex and I would send an email to one another about once every six months to update each other on our lives. I considered her a good friend after the breakup and mentioned in the most recent email (of a few months back) that I had found a girl (my current fiance) that I was really happy with and felt really good. When my fiance found saw that, she accused me of betraying her and that it would be hard to trust me again. She said it was pathetic that I would talk with someone who cheated on me (the reason I ended that relationship) and that I needed to end contact with her. I agreed and sent an email to my ex saying that we shouldn't talk anymore and that was it... except for the next two years when she would bring it up whenever I did something to frustrate her.\n\nThe next thing wasn't too long after. We began making out and then told me that my facial hair was irritating and told me to shave. I laughed and told her I'll make sure it is gone the next morning. She then told me to do it right away. I thought she was joking so I smiled and repeated that it would be the next day... I certainly haven't always been clean-shaven 100% of the time we have been together. She then said that I didn't respect her then left my apartment... The situation with my ex I could at least understand but this really left me gobsmacked for... the twenty minutes it took her to return to my apartment to apologize.\n\nAfter living together back in my home country, she would become increasingly critical of whatever I did.... usually related to housework / cleanliness. If I left the dishes for a night, there would be a problem. If I did the dishes but missed a spot of grease, another problem. Little bit of food waste in the sink, problem. However, it is only a problem when I do it. She does the exact same things (to which, I don't really care.... we are working students, I get if you are too exhausted to pick up after yourself). The double standard, though, is really extreme. If I try to point that out, she will point out something else I did (ex girlfriend, for example). I would always end up exhausted and apologize... thinking it was better to just move on.\n\nOur sex life has also gotten steadily worse. When it happens, it is fine.... but this only comes maybe once a month. I feel that this isn't normal but cannot be sure. I mentioned her that I am concerned about this but she was very dismissive of this. I can't remember her exact wording, but I was basically told that I was wrong that I felt that way. Another time I brought it up, she said that if I do more work around the house, I will get more sex. \n\nThe last thing I will write about, and perhaps leading me to write to you all today, is that she will whine and complain every time my family invites her to a dinner or event. She complains that she never gets enough time to herself and that we go to my family's every weekend (in reality, we are invited once a month.... still a lot but still less than once a week). These events are usually just a dinner for a few hours... nothing more. This past weekend, she was invited by my step-mother as one of a small group to my sister's baby shower. She huffed but agreed. Last week Dad called me up and asked if I wanted to spend the morning with him since my fiance will be heading up anyways, to which I said of course! Well, my fiance complained that I wasn't respectful of her time since that meant she would have to leave an hour earlier. Because of this, we had a fight on the way up and on the way back, I apologized and said that we need to try to understand each other better and was going to do my best to do better moving forward. To which, she complained that we never do anything and nothing changes. I felt complete shock and then, for the first time in the relationship, nothing. It is hard to explain but it felt like something completely shutoff inside and lost *all* motivation to continue talking. I haven't talked to her since. I know that this isn't constructive... but I honestly feel a little bit better. It is ironic that even though by not talking, I am being an objectively worst partner, I have not been criticized yet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was a lot more than I was planning on writing. There was more I was going to write, but I think this post became long enough. If you made it to here, thank you. Now, my question to the remaining few of you is what are your thoughts on this relationship. I feel that, at the very least, we would need couples therapy. My fear is coming from the fact that I am moving into a marriage that I am starting to have a lot of doubts about. My gut is telling me that there are too many issues but when it the relationship is good, it feels great. \n\nAm I over-analyzing this? Is this pre-marriage jitters? Do I need to do more?

Here's how it all started....", "author": "karma_cormorant", "self_text": "Warning:  long post\n\nI split for the final time with my nex in mid- 2018. As of last week, the divorce settlement is finally final and I'm waiting on the judge to approve it. It's been an incredibly awful, eye-opening journey.   I hope this may help someone out there.\n\nI was trying to leave for years. YEARS. But for some reason I just chickened out or convinced myself not to upset the apple cart because I had a \"good life\".\n\nIn 2016, I was convinced he cheated on me and insisted we go to couples therapy. He thought the therapy was for me and my anxiety. Anxiety that he caused. I stopped wanting to go to work, or leave the house at all. I stopped talking to my friends. I shut down and got very snippy. I defended his behaviour and outright lied to protect him when others would make negative comments about him. The therapist even diagnosed him separately from me with some kind of \"adjustment disorder \". I didn't understand  but I knew something was wrong. Any time we were \"making progress \" in therapy, when I'd open up, he'd find a brand new thing to torture me with. I'd shut down again. And then he'd tell me I was the reason for the \"poor communication\" in our marriage. It was all my fault, always.\n\nI got cancer in 2017. This is where I finally figured out what was going on. He never came to any of my surgeries or treatments... and I didn't want him to. I didn't want him to see me vulnerable  at all. I told no one for months that I was sick. I internalized everything, put on a strong face. Eventually I couldn't hold it in anymore and completely broke down. People I was close with at the time called me dramatic and said it wasn't \"that bad\".\n\nFastforward another year. I had complications from my treatments. A few months after I was doing much better, I thought my marriage might recover, however, my nex blurted out one day after I thought we were having a nice evening: \"when can we have sex again?!\" In that exact moment, I know it was never about me,or us, or anything other than how I was useful to him, until I wasn't. I wasn't a person with real feelings, or thoughts, or anything outside or separate of him. I was only supposed to parrot everything he wanted me to say and think and behave. If I didn't, he'd argue with me, telling me he knows better than me because I am dumb and don't read enough/ not good at it/or some other thing that he clearly knows more about what's best. \n\nI told no one immediately when we separated, in fact we had to go to two more social functions together and pretend nothing was wrong. After physically separating myself, it was very difficult for the first week or two,  I almost apologised and went back to him, same as always before, but this time was different. 4 months passed like that and I was becoming stronger and more independent each day. I even started talking to other men and advertising myself as separated, stopped wearing my ring, put on more makeup, wearing nicer clothes. \n\nThen the unthinkable happened... he hacked my computer and phone GPS and began stalking and terrorizing me. I lawyered up immediately. He hurled insult after insult, he blocked and delayed the divorce process for as much as he could for as long as he could. Every chance he got to be a complete ass, he did... and so much worse. He defamed me, writing inherently damaging lies about me. In total there were SIX cease and desist orders.\n\nI lost nearly all of my friends in this process because they didn't want to be involved, said I brought it on myself, or said I was \"too much to handle\" (despite always rushing to their side whenever they needed someone, even when I was emotionally overwhelmed myself).  But ones I never expected came to my side. I am better off. My family stuck by me too. I found a great therapist who specialises in victims of narcissistic abuse and I've begun to heal, work on myself, and learn the behavioural red flags to avoid the same traps again. I still don't feel safe, and I hide a lot and sometimes I ignore my remaining friends. \n\nThe settlement process took 1.5 years before he finally signed. The only reason he signed at all was because he didn't want to turn over his financial documents and the motion to compel and subpoenas were 2 days away. My best guess is he was hiding something - perhaps a new victim, or just the fact he's broke (which I calculated), which is shameful to him and causes a narcissist Injury if he's not better than everyone else, including buying things to make himself look better off financially than he actually was. He kept his individual finances secret our whole marriage. \n\nIn the end, I got all my stuff back without ever having to see him in person, I mailed the house key back anonymously. I got more than I would have in court. Both lawyers hate him, and his is suing him for nonpayment. He's completely broke and saddled with crippling debt. #karma\n\nI'm sure he will continue to tell outrageous tales about me, forever painting me as a villain. But I've nearly stopped caring what others think. I got my life back. One without him in it. A better one. I am free.\n\nMy advice for anyone experiencing the true horror of divorcing a narcissist is to not back down, get yourself an aggressive lawyer and hide behind your lawyer. That's what you pay them for.. The narc Wants to make you suffer and bully you into submission. Don't. As tempting as it is to just want to wash your hands of it,don't let them win. They live for the \"win\". Dont settle for anything less than you deserve, which is lot when you are dealing with these high conflict situations. Remember and begin to see your nex as a 3 year old child throwing a tantrum.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The atmosphere was friendly, happy, relaxed. I finally felt safe and at peace. Like everything was going right in my life. I felt comfortable with myself. I walked into the room and everyone was happy to see me. It was good times all around and things were finally right. I was happy. \n\nSuddenly my focus was drawn to a small window on the other side of the room, straight across from me. I saw glimpses of a car driving around outside. I could only see small sections of it, but it seemed to be going in circles, driving past the window over and over again. \n\nI saw glimpses of gray paint with a black stripe through it. My stomach dropped.   \nI saw the Mustang logo and my heart began to pound.   \n*\"It can't be.\"* I thought.   \nThe car disappeared for a minute, and I thought maybe he had driven away when suddenly I saw it driving slowly past the window, parallel to it. \n\nIt drove until I could see the driver clearly, and then he stopped. It was my ex and he was staring straight at me, right into my soul. There was a girl in the passenger seat that I could barely see, but the window was centered around his face. He was just staring. Then he slowly smiled this huge evil grin. The only thing I can think to compare his face to is Satan. \n\nMy heart stopped when his eyes locked onto mine, and I just knew that he was going to kill me. Then I woke up. \n\n\\---\n\nI had this dream while I was sleeping over at my new boyfriend's house. It was so terrifying that it woke me up, but my boyfriend was holding me and I immediately felt safe. This dream wasn't even as scary as it was deeply unsettling and bone-chilling. I have a fear that my ex will come back to kill me like he always said he would. \n\nHe always told me he was going to buy a gun one day so he could kill me before he killed himself. Ever since I broke up with him, grey rocked, and slowly phased out of his life, I've been terrified that one day, when everything in my life is good and I'm not even thinking of him anymore, he's going to come back and finish what he started. \n\nI think this dream was just a manifestation of that fear. Deep down I worry that this was some sort of \"supernatural sign\" that he's coming for me, but I'm trying desperately to keep myself in reality. \n\nIt was just a bad dream.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My friends/family are sick of me crying every day and suggested I get onto some dating apps, as they thought it would help.  They thought it might be good for me to see there are others out there for me.  However, and it\u2019s really made me A LOT worse.\n\nI am still completely in love with my ex.  Looking at other men makes me feel sick to the pit of my stomach.  No one even comes close to him in my eyes.  This then leads me to wonder whether he was even narcissistic at all.  And whether the whole thing was just my fault.  My mum says I am feeling like this because he built himself up and put me down so much that now I\u2019m obsessed that he is this amazing person that he isn\u2019t.  Problem is - I really feel he is amazing, but that he just didn\u2019t love me.  I never looked at another man once in the whole of our 5 year relationship.\n\nAnyway, what I really wanted to know was whether others feel the same way as me? Am I trying to date too soon?  Maybe he\u2019s not even narcissistic and I can\u2019t cope with my own regret.\n\nBackground Info - Dated for 5 years.  I ended the relationship as I became fed up of feeling unimportant/unloved (he knew it was coming). I tried to go back on it 5 weeks later but he already had a new girlfriend from work.

He would constantly tell me \u201cwhat kind of guy he is\u201d or just like constantly tell me over and over things about his personality.

I just thought it\u2019s weird he kept telling me things instead of actually.. showing me that he is. \n\nThen he\u2019d always say he has such a high pain tolerance and never gets sick.

I\u2019ve just never had anyone in my life outright tell me all the time \u201cI\u2019m this kind of guy\u201d or tell me how hardworking they are, etc. I feel like those are things you show to someone, don\u2019t have to keep telling them. And I don\u2019t mean right in the beginning of the relationship during the getting to know you time.

I've known it for years. I know when I'm getting played - but how is it I can still wonder if it's him or is it me? Am I the issue? What if I am the issue, will I regret leaving? I tell so many people how my life is and they all say the same \"RUN\" yet I stay. I don't want to ruin his life, he can be a good dad - just not a good husband.\n\nBACKGROUND: We have been together for almost 10 years, military couple- He got out, I've stayed in. There were so many red flags, in the beginning, I ignored them all, including the TRO I had placed on him - because it was countered with one against me saying I had hit him. I was so scared - I went back, we got married. Then I went reserves and worked a civilian job, we would commute on public transit together - I remember how I would look at him and just think I hated him. But I got played into changing my BC  -a week after telling him I was pregnant with this baby I was \"promised what we needed\", I was accused of purposefully getting pregnant to \"rope\" him in for 18 years,  as soon as the baby was 2months old, he wanted a divorce, he had gone to a work conference and now there was this new girl all over his IG. It became more physical, more emotional abuse. If it wasn't for my child, I have NO clue where I would be. I poured all my love into this baby because the child was the only thing saving me. I've been threatened if I were to take the child from him he \"would fucking kill me\", all this before slamming my head into the wall while I held said child - he then began crying and ran away before more happened.\n\nThe past year was hell. I deployed with the military to the middle eat, came back, told \"I can do this without you, I don't need you anymore\" - which was hard enough on top of being called a whore the entire time deployed. (If anyone has deployed, you know you can have it easy or work 16+ hours/day for 7 days a week for 10 months straight - I got the latter, and still called twice a day, every day.) I've tried my best when I got back, I was in a new city/state - no job and so lost -  but it's hard when constantly put down and in depression wondering \"what did I just go through? and what am I living now?\"  I wanted to love him, I wanted my family, so I tried. Within the past few weeks Ive been praised with \"I see you, and I want you to know I appreciate you.\" but then I was chastised for shaving my legs, to go to a fun marathon with my friends, alluded to me cheating. Then I had military drill - I was told \"it's getting in my way. I'm going to sign up for extra BS on weekends and say its mandatory. You make a choice to stay in for yourself.\" (Ya'll I'm close to retirement, at this point I'm just doing to get the retirement check but you know, only myself) No matter if I am trying or not, it's not enough. and I have ZERO support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow here I am, I've contacted multiple attorney's - and I'm just scared.

I've left before and I know the lovebombing, I don't want to hear how I hurt him or see/hear him cry. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWHY DO THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO FUCK US UP SO MUCH, EVEN AFTER WE KNOW?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was crushed and felt like shit so instead of falling into depression again I hit the gym harder than ever. She would still text me from time to time saying why am I mad at her when am I going to forgive her. She wanted to quit at one point because she felt uncomfortable because I was ignoring her even though. We work in different departments. \n\nI still got text from time to time.

I was really jarred when I found out that my narc had a new supply just one day after he discarded me. For starters, I had no way of ascertaining how long he\u2019d been talking to her while we were still dating. All I knew for sure was that he\u2019d flirted with her once at a party... he admitted that to me to purposefully hurt me.

I felt used, replaced, insecure, and, well, discarded. \n\nToday I found out that his new girl has broken things off with him \u2013 just one week after I learned of her existence. \n\nI hate to say it, but it was karmic (seemingly, anyway). It\u2019s definitely shed some new perspective on things for me because it lead me consider that maybe me (and his other victims, for that matter) really aren\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s him. His behavior is the reason why he can\u2019t hold onto anyone. It hardly matters whether or not his targets physically leave/discard him first, because when a narcissist discards somebody, it\u2019s usually because that person has already realized and called out their bad behavior. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t form and nurture authentic relationships and attachments like normal people do. There are errors in his circuitry. He will repeat the same faulty pattern again and again. It\u2019s him.\n\nTo anybody who is upset because their narcissist has a new supply \u2013\n\nDon\u2019t fret too much. At the very least, remember that their relationship will inevitably fall apart. Narcissists live for the idealization/devaluation/discard cycle, and his new supply isn\u2019t going to stay \u201cnew\u201d to him forever.

I have only been aware of this for 2 years at this point and am trying to heal from this hole I have inside.\n\nMy family is still together and I have younger siblings living with them. I am very close with my mum, although since   \n my dad had done some irresponsible things with my student finance last year and I found out in therapy (for the stress and dissociation) that I had been a victim of abuse (or neglect?) from someone who may be a Narc, I have been very distant from my dad. I had a weird upbringing, my parents had me young and I grew up on a rough council estate (social housing if you're American) and later moved to a beautiful rural home.  So I have experienced two very different ends of the same stick. \n\nMy dad is a big tough working man, I would go to work with him and learn so much about working with my hands. at twelve years old I could apply practical trade skills and operate machinery that grown men would struggle with. I was given so much, but also so little. he could offer me everything but healthy emotional support. he also had a bad temper and was a very large intimidating guy. I have frequent memories of him lashing out at service people, beating other dads up, etc.. He was never really one to show affection and praise in a fatherly way much, and when Encouraged by my Mum; It felt like he was uncomfortable with it. I remember on a number of occasions being punished in very harsh ways (held by the throat, slapped across the head, grounded for 3 months for back-chat, etc..)  things got a little easier as I got older but the emotional and parental side of things were never quite right. I have recently dropped out of a very prestigious university after realizing that I don't want that for me (as well as several other factors) and am going to go back into being a tradesman. I recently had the talk about this with my Mum who had no negatives to offer and in a more recent call this week, she had told me she brought up my difficulties in education with my dad. who oddly said He is \"behind me no matter what\". Which sort of stunned me as this is not the first display of this behavior from him over the last year. My girlfriend and I visited around 6 months ago and as we were leaving , unprompted and very sincere sounding He grabbed me, hugged me tightly and said: \"Love you, son\". It tears me up inside that I was so distant with him and part of me thinks I am now not trying or putting the effort in at all. \n\nRecently, I have been experimenting with the idea of forgiveness. As I have been navigating this minefield, I realize that he is also a victim. I am now as a grown man, able to process his relationship with my grandma, who did some very awful things to him as a child, Like having his beloved dog shot dead in the back yard while he was at school because it barked too loudly, I also regularly witnessed her berating him non stop when I was young. His Dad also passed when he was around 10 years old, and I now understand how all this would affect his parenting skills. \n\nAfter talking with my girlfriend , I thought a start would be a thoughtful Christmas gift.

It is my second semester in college and on my birthday I actually got an opportunity to start working at my college as well. So there was this guy who was nice to me and talked to me.(nobody else really did and I have no friends) I thought he was cool. I told him it was my birthday on my first day working and he asked how old I was and I replied 17. He told me I don\u2019t look 17. To which I responded that people usually say I look like I am 12. The next day I don\u2019t wear makeup and I was like \u201cew I feel ugly\u201d and we are alone walking to change printer ink and he tells me \u201cto me you look the same as yesterday I don\u2019t see anything wrong\u201d okay I can take a compliment but I felt strange when he told me that like I didn\u2019t say anything and walked uncomfortably.

Time goes by and I don\u2019t know how this came up but basically I found out he smokes too. So he gives me his number and mouths the words \u201cso we can smoke.\u201d Now I know I don\u2019t know this man very well but who is going to turn down free drugs I\u2019m young. So we end up smoking. He picked me up from campus and we left to smoke just in the car around the block and he dropped me off. I felt a little weird but I ignored it. My creep senses didn\u2019t have a strong detection that time. He picked me up from campus because I don\u2019t have a car and he knows I can\u2019t leave my house and at this time I think he\u2019s 25 but I soon find out he\u2019s 34. So me and him talk nothing sexual or at least I wasn\u2019t I just thought he was better than everybody in the office. A couple days pass and he wants me to smoke with him but he got off before me. He waited 20 minutes in the parking lot for me as soon as he started to drive off he said \u201coh it\u2019s at my house\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to do so I didn\u2019t say anything then he stops at a gas station and ask if I want to drink (alcohol) with him. I didn\u2019t really want to and I\u2019m not one to turn down a drink and I seriously considered not drinking but I reluctantly agreed. We get to his house and smoke but I was so uncomfortable I had also remembered he owns like 4 or 5 guns I could\u2019ve been stuck there held captive so I decided to leave. He took me back to school because he knows he can\u2019t drop me off at my house he didn\u2019t touch me or say anything sexual thankfully. Then one day I was sitting at a shared desk and he comes up to me and ask if he can use the desk and I say yes. Then he tells me \u201c you need to stop being friendly becau...\u201d he cuts himself off and says \u201cI\u2019ll tell you in a minute.\u201d So now I\u2019m like Um okay ? Then he tells me to go with him so we can swap office phones for new ones. He gets me alone with him in the elevator and says \u201c oh yea you need to stop being friendly because I was going to grab your ass like to move you\u201d okay this guy knows I am 17 I have told him many times. I was so uncomfortable we were alone in the elevator I didn\u2019t know what to say so I didn\u2019t say anything. We had to wait for someone at the office so we were sitting in chairs and he showed me a picture of some random girl and was like \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck her on her lunch break\u201d and okay? Your a fucking grown ass man adults have sex big fucking deal. I didn\u2019t think much of it and here goes me with my big mouth and I don\u2019t know why I told him but I did about this girl I was arguing with and I told him how I told her things that me and my boyfriend do. He told me \u201cdamn I would want to see that\u201d and I freeze. He told me \u201c I\u2019ll show you if you show me\u201d and I didn\u2019t say anything I couldn\u2019t even look at him. He said \u201c so is that a no\u201d and I said \u201cno.\u201d So we just sat there awkwardly. Time goes by and I forget about it at the time I had another job as well at a fast food place. Now I know this part is my fault trust me I understand HR has already made me feel like a dumb bitch about it. I call him while I\u2019m at my fast food job so he can come and smoke me out. By the time he told me he was coming I instantly regretted what I did I made my friend come outside with me but she was all coked out so wouldn\u2019t have been a big help but she made me feel a little better not that much. She comes outside and comes to the car and says \u201chow old are you, you look old.\u201d And he said \u201chow old are you?\u201d She responded \u201cI\u2019m 25\u201d then he said \u201cI\u2019m 25 too\u201d keep in mind I know for a fact he is at least 34. I look at him from the corner of my eyes without turning my head and I was just thinking wtf did I just get myself into. I was freaking out on the inside told myself this would be the last time I would ever talk or smoke with him. My friend has to go back to work and he wanted me to walk with him and his dog to the grass area. Keep in mind it is 10 o\u2019clock at night I\u2019m scared my friend was going inside I wasn\u2019t going to walk with him and his dog. The joint was still lit but I just left him. My other friend was in the patio she used to work there but she quit. So I went to go sit with her. The friend that was on coke said \u201cdid you just leave him like that you are so mean\u201d I told her why I left him like that but of course she doesn\u2019t know the whole story because I didn\u2019t tell her he lied about his age I was already embarrassed. Then he was leaving but came passing by where we were sitting my other friend who was drinking saw his dog and told him to park so she can pet his dog and I was like omg I just want him to leave. My friend who was drinking saw his face and looks at me and says \u201cwtf is wrong with you he looks so old\u201d she kept saying it and I was feeling more scared and embarrassed. Anyways he leaves I don\u2019t talk a lot I want him gone. I go home still thinking about what my friend said for just leaving him so I texted him. I said sorry I was scared my mom was gonna see. Which I really wasn\u2019t but it was an excuse because your 34 hanging out with a 17 year old that\u2019s scared her mom is going to see her. He said sorry doesn\u2019t buy me weed and responded with you owe me. I took that as sexual and I told him I would give him $10 on Friday. Friday never came because I was so scared I called in to go late. I didn\u2019t see I\u2019m for a few days but I had went into work early and I knew I was going to see him so I called my boyfriend to avoid a conversation with him. This fucking man then proceeds to use an app we use to go in and fix peoples computers for the school and basically hacks into my work computer and opens up a work document and types \u201cget back to work\u201d and I wrote \u201cleave me alone\u201d he then started laughing. I started going into work late to avoid him and the day before I reported him I knew he was going to be coming out of work as soon as I was walking in so I walked the long way. Keep in mind I was so determined not to see him I walked the long way on a cold windy and rainy day.. I see these carts that we use to get around campus and I\u2019m hoping it is not him. I put my headphones and hoodie on and look down. It was him and he stopped me. He asked if I was mad and I said no. He said oh you haven\u2019t been texting me I used school as an excuse and went about my Business and continued walking. I get into the office and he throws his hands in the air and said \u201cI thought you were leaving\u201d I quickly replied no. I thought it was weird he thought that because I hadn\u2019t been in the office. The next day I spoke with a intern and told him everything he said that the creep guy gives him creep vibes also because the first day the intern started working there they went in those carts and he said that the perv was driving and was looking at every single girls ass and boobs that walked by then would look at him making faces expecting him to be like omg \ud83d\ude06! Now our office is right next to the early college high school building so who\u2019s to say that he wasn\u2019t checking out another little ass girl. I reported him the next day at first I didn\u2019t want to but I had to think about other girls he could have done or is doing this to. 5 days went by before they had even told him I reported him. I had to call my supervisor before I would go into work to make sure he wasn\u2019t there. I started to get angry because I was already doing that and now it was worse because I had to wait until he was completely gone off campus before I could go which was making me angry so I complained about that and about HR being slow then the other day they wouldn\u2019t let me leave the office until someone could walk with me because he was HELPING THE VETERINARY CLASS BY VOLUNTEERING TO BRING HIS DOG. Are you fucking kidding me? So today they talked to him and I found out he cannot come to work or campus until the investigation is over. With all this being said if anyone has even made it this far. I have been thinking about how he feels or what\u2019s going through his mind. Does he feel sorry or does he think he has done anything wrong is he angry or was it an accident he didn\u2019t mean to make me feel this way. And I have been thinking about how he can\u2019t come to work and make money. Why do I feel like this? I thought it was what I wanted it is but at the same time I feel a little bad maybe because I am a minor and it could really hurt his reputation. Which is deserving I think but I still have second thoughts. What do you think did I do the right thing am I over exaggerating please help me clear my mind.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I've gotten pushed to the point I was convinced I was the one out of line and at certain points I was and with the help of this sub I was able to understand where that came from and how defense mode sometimes does take you to and ugly place. Either way we stuck it out for whatever reason. I thought we could get to a happy place.\n\nTonight I think it ended for good and I can't stop crying. The reason it ended is because my whole life's goals is to travel. I went to school for photography to travel. I haven't been able to do much with it. I've struggled with depression most of my life and sometimes have pretty bad anxiety but i've taken steps and measures to keep it under control. (This relationship really did a number on me as a person and my self confidence and self esteem as well that I really had to do therapy and all that). Any way though this relationship I lost a lot of friends. Almost all of them if I'm to be completely honest.  Really good friends too that I still miss and feel guilty about distancing myself from.  I have one friend she lives in the Netherlands and I live in Colorado, the last time I saw her was just about 10 years ago. She's my oldest standing friend that I have the unspeakable bond with.  She's planning a trip to Mexico coming up and invited me to come which I'm jumping on.\n\nWell getting down to it boyfriend doesn't like my life's goals for travel.  Doesn't trust me to be with other people. We started fighting because I told him I was going to renew my passport tomorrow and now we are broken up. He just found out his dad has cancer this morning too and all I want to do is to be there for him but he doesn't want to be with me because I want to travel.  I feel like i put so much into this relationship but I guess I'm really proud of me too because with all the negativity and all the fights and all the times being the peace maker, I'm standing up for my future goals and plans.\n\nHonestly I know i didn't focus too much on the emotional abuse part that is this sub.  I don't even know if anyone will read this far.  I know going our separate ways is for the best but fuck I hurt right now. I don't even know if this rambling makes sense or what but its just even helping by me tying this out. I wish I was stronger.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

The way my friendship dynamics usually go is that usually I try really hard to cater to the other person and I'm normally quite funny and upbeat and try to make the other person feel comfortable in conversations, but unfortunately, due to the mental hell I've been through the past year, I became very depressed and anxious and I was always mentally gone and was very not fun to be around. As a result, the friendships with the people whose opinions I highly respect have all faltered and I don't know what to do anymore. Those friendships mean so much to me but I feel like I've lost them due to circumstances that were not my fault. They started treating me worse and obviously respected me less, being that I lost some of my inherent value as a person, as a lot of what I liked about myself was my charm, wit, and confidence - all of which I lost through my past relationship. My anxiety became even higher and higher because I recognize that when I go through mentally / emotionally bad times in my life, I tend to lose all the people that matter to me. This has happened one time before in my life, in senior year my high school year, when I started just undergoing terrible mental health problems, and it is a huge trauma for me. My relationship with my family became horrible for years due to that, and that was my big, big fear, and the main thing I was scared of leaving this relationship. Unfortunately, everything I feared came true and my relationships / friendships are so fucked up now and I know that the people who I highly respect think very little of me and don't want to be friends with me anymore. Now I don't know what to do. I want so badly to reconnect with them and try to earn their friendship again and let them know that I'm deserving, and that I miss them, and I don't want the dynamic to be like the way it is, but I'm also very very cautious. This is the exact thing I thought after breaking up with my ex the first time, that I could \"earn\" the relationship back again and I missed him so much and that if I just showed my best aspects to him we could go back to the way things were. But it was bad, because we had legitimately broken up because he was toxic, and he was a toxic person, and so when we started going out again it just broke me because I was constantly trying to earn something back again and he walked all over me and the dynamic of the relationship / friendship was just broken tbh. So now I don't know what to do. I don't know if these friendships ended due to an inherent toxicity in either me or her, or because I was just going through a mentally bad time. I'm very scared to chase after someone again, and to lay everything down on the floor and open my heart and to get hurt because the other person doesn't respect me. I really can't tell. I can't trust my urges anymore, even though they guided me very well in the past. All I can think about is the regret from losing these friendships and I don't know what to do / how to repair them because they obviously look down on me a lot. Can I get some advice? To you guys, does it seem like these friendships have an inherent toxicity to them or should I try to reconnect and win people back (which I have a lot of trouble doing, because I just don't want to make myself a dog again and make the same mistakes I made before). Please advise me, it's hard to know wrong from right right now.\n\nOr should I just accept these friendships as lost causes, and move forward and just try to meet other people. It feels bad, because I've had good times with these people, and our friendship was healthy before, and some of these friendships reach 5+ years back, but I just don't know how I can get back to the same dynamics we had before when I've lost so much of who I am.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

But I am having a very hard time accepting the fact that he smears me everywhere he can, lying. I think he might even have convinced himself that the lies are true. The worst part is when he talked to my own mother. How do you just ignore and let go off knowing that they are out there smearing your name and acting like they are the normal ones? I'm a very introverted person and I always hate when people talk bullshit about others. I have managed to vent about him to my closest friends however so I won't feel so horrible anymore from the constant abuse but that's as far as I have gone. Should I too go out in public with his behaviour to combat his lies? My mother is worried he might be psychopathic after meeting with him. I used to walk on eggshells all the time, the frustrating part is he is lying and claiming it was him. I have always hated injustice. How do you guys just let it go?

Like, neglect level type ****. They don't hit their children and they 'love' them so that makes everything else acceptable it seems. I've gone to schooling for child development and have been working with kids for the past 4 years now. I'm not a parent because I know I'm not equipped to be one right now, emotionally. They appear very selfish to me like they needed someone to love them and accept their damaged parts so they had children. Like they've all had mental health issues and only 1 has gotten real treatment for it, she's improved but I can see damage that has already been done. \n\nMy mother is someone who I always viewed as empathetic and giving, now I view her as codependent, neglectful, confused. She was abused imo severely in childhood and never got it resolved, just passed it onto her 4 children. Our fathers (I'm their half sister, I have a dif dad) were also ****. There is no family for them to have a positive example of and have carried their negative traits into adulthood, and I'm scared to be like them. Being around them makes me feel like an outsider and in a way I guess that makes me happy because I'd never hope to turn out as complacent as they have.\n\nI love them. And I feel for them. We all grew up together, I was extremely like them when I was a young child and teenager, I just feel like i pulled myself out of it (yet struggled so damn hard to do so with literally no support from anyone). So my love for them feels burdened and heavy, like I owe them my care, help and attention and I see them and play nice out of guilt. I simultaneously kind of hate them. I was constantly used as a babysitter for the kids while I was in middle school/hs, viewed as selfish when I got older and would say no or say, ya know, pay a babysitter for just 1 night of your life??? they didnt stop having despite being in horrible relationships or bad life circumstances, no money, total reliance on our grandparents for constant free childcare and support. I'm just so bitter. and unacknowledged. I just 'expect too much'or my standards are too high or something. If I talk to my mom about this, she says I'm like my dad and expect everyone to live according to my ideas of what's right, and she says she loves and accepts people for who they are. I say I love my nieces and nephews and wont let my love for my sisters override their neglectful or abusive behavior. And then she dismisses it. Because she hasnt broken patterns either and used to be the same way when she was a young mother. And shes right, my dad is a hyper critical ahole, constantly berated me and made me hard on myself and expect perfection from myself (and sometimes others??) So that's where my dilemma is. How can I love them from a distance? Or watch injustice happen? I fear I expect too much and I'm not owed anything, but I dont want to associate with people who do bad things and make me feel embarrassed that I'm tolerating their behavior. Am I being too self righteous ???? They talk to each other all the time and are close, idk how to be a part of the family without being super close.

I fell in love fast and hard (I would say we, but, in retrospect, y'know), and I'm realizing that my account matches so many I've read in just the few minutes I've been reading through this sub.\n\nHe told me he loved me, wanted kids with me, to grow old with me, etc. Wrote me love notes and said everything I had always, my entire life, wanted to hear. I fell for it all. Halfway through the 8 months we were together (not long, I know, but it felt like the love of my life), I began to recognize his manipulative behavior. Guilt-tripping the hell out of me if I didn't make time for him, openly mocking me in front of our friends, telling me any concerns I had about how he was treating me came down to my behavior and what I did, or he just \"didn't remember\" what he did (I very clearly remember looking up the definition of gaslighting on the way to his place one evening -- yeah, it fit). Within two months, if we wanted to see each other (we lived about an hour and a half apart), I had to be the one to make all the effort.\n\nBut of course, I excused it all, because hey, I thought he was it. He had entirely convinced me of that. I had tried to break it off once, and almost did a second time, but he reeled me back in each time.\n\nBut then, in true form as I'm finding out, he started to pull away. I made time for him, tried so hard to play it cool and just \"go with it\", but he just kept pulling away more and more to the point where he basically ghosted me, and I had to be the one to message him saying \"so, we're done then, right?\"\n\nI couldn't believe that his relationship that had meant so much to me, that I was convinced was the last relationship I would ever had, came down to that sentence.\n\nWhen I asked him (over text, mind you, because this narcissist couldn't be bothered to make the effort to see me) if he could give me the respect to tell me why, he had the nerve to tell me it was because we had \"different expectations\" of the relationship. This was his way of telling me, it was my fault.\n\nI was wrecked for a very long time. I was still in love with him for months after that. I was in love and hurt and angry and just absolutely destroyed. And the worst part was, I knew I would never get an apology from him. I would never get a real, honest, adult conversation about it. He didn't give a shit about me. I would never truly have closure.\n\nIt took me a very long time to come to terms with that. One thing that helped was when I began to read various articles describing narcissists, it all clicked. I realized who he was, and what he had done, and that it had truly been an emotionally abusive relationship. I felt so fucking stupid -- I thought I was a smarter, stronger woman than that. It was odd -- it was both strangely reassuring, and hard to come to terms with.\n\nFast forward to now, and thankfully, all the love I had for him is gone. All that's left it disdain and contempt.\n\nBut, just discovered this sub, and holy shit it makes me want to cry. It's like a weird validation that I'm not alone, that I'm not just some dumb asshole who fell for a line. It's the apology I never received, the one I will never get. A support group I never realized I needed.\n\nHope that all makes sense.\n\nTL;DNR very thankful this sub exists.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I normally only write about the big moments...or little poems...or the stressful stuff that I need to get out...or the good times I want to remember.  Through it all, writing has always helped me figure things out. \n\nMy ex **HATED** it.  At first he would just roll his eyes when I talked about it. Then about seven months into dating, he started to say things like: \"I don't like that there's this record out there of your *imagined viewpoints* of our arguments.\"  Then, \"Oh. You're journaling again? You always twist things in your journal so I'm the bad guy. Its fucking weird!\"  Or, \"I'm worried about you, you're not letting go of our past arguments because you wrote them down. Honestly, its really unhealthy.\" And then every time we'd have a fight, he'd say things like: \"Is this because your still mad about some fake fight you wrote in your journal? I bet I'm the bad guy in the next entry too!\" \n\nEventually....I just stopped writing. And I hate that I did, because I lost a piece of me, and I lost the reality check that journaling had always provided me. As an example:\n\n&gt;2014: 30 entries (pretty normal!)   \n&gt;  \n&gt;2015 (first year of relationship): 15   \n&gt;  \n&gt;2016: 1   \n&gt;  \n&gt;2017: 3   \n&gt;  \n&gt;2018: 1   \n&gt;  \n&gt;2019: 43 (...all written while I was waking up, and in the wake of the break up.) \n\nI look at this...and its such a great representation of what happened to my spirit. I can *see* what he took away from me. And the entries that I do have are devastating re-read. A little as a few months ago I was afraid to classify what he did as abuse, but I had everything I needed to know it years ago. I have entries that are screaming: \"He is treating you so badly!\" \"Leave!\" ...and I stayed...and deep down I wonder if I stopped writing because I didn't want to face the truth.  If I hadn't started journaling again this year...I think I'd still be with him. \n\nTo be honest, I'm aching to share my journal with someone. I'm still debating how to do that. For now, I'll just share a poem I wrote this year during the waking up phase. Good luck to everyone out there still in it, or getting out, or trying to find yourselves again.

He's also threatened that if I call the police, we'll both be deported (which isn't true: we both have legal residency where we are).\n\nIANAD, but I suspect that it's a combination of NPD + BPD + shitty cultural attitudes toward women in general.\n\nI am tired of feeling afraid.

You\u2019ve brought up things from years ago that I have said or done (many of which I don\u2019t remember) and I have never hesitated to not only apologize but feel genuine remorse. Even if I don\u2019t remember doing it. If I hurt you, I never meant to, and I\u2019m so sorry. \n\nI never want to hurt anyone I love. I know I do, I\u2019m not a perfect person but I try my absolute best to be a good person. I want to learn from my mistakes and grow. I will not make excuses for myself. I want to always own my mistakes to make better choices in my future. \n\nThis is the difference between us dear friend. I care about how you feel and you only care about how you feel. If you cared about how I felt, we wouldn\u2019t be here. You would have said sorry and meant it.  I wasn\u2019t attacking you, I wasn\u2019t even really looking for an apology. You asked and I answered, because if it were me I would want clarity. I want to know when I hurt a loved one so I can apologize and try to make it right. \n\nThere\u2019s a part of me that wants to go back to the good ole days. I want things to be ok between us. However I know too much now. Even if you were to apologize, it would just be a way to get back in and the cycle would continue. I can\u2019t go back from here. You\u2019re not learning anything because you don\u2019t want to. \n\nFor that I am so sorry. I\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t see others perspectives. I\u2019m sorry whatever that has been eating your soul up for years, has caused your behavior to be this way.  I\u2019m sorry that this is the end for us and I\u2019m even more sorry that it isn\u2019t the end of your toxicity. That will never end until you come to some hard truths, take a good honest look at yourself and want better. I hope you find peace with your past and present so that you can have a positive future.  \n\nI\u2019m a so sorry friend, I genuinely hope you find that peace and clarity you deserve.  \nHowever your lack of peace will no longer cost me mine.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She would hit me, pull my hair, and scream profanity at me. The physical abuse lasted until I was 11-years-old, and she only stopped once CPS got involved. My dad knew; he did nothing.\n\nAt the age of 6, I got sexually molested at school by another female. My mother told me it was not molestation, and that I was just \"playing around.\" \n\nAt the age of 11, I was sexually abused by the neighborhood boys. They were in their mid-teens, and would touch me inappropriately, rub their penises against me, and tell me inappropriate jokes. At that same age, I was also dry humped on the face by multiple boys who I considered friends.\n\nAt the age of 16, I was raped by a 26-year-old man. He groomed me beginning at the age of 14-years-old, and convinced me he was a safe person. At that same point in my life, I was raped by a 23-year-old that I had known for two years and considered safe. He took me to a room where we could \"be alone\" then proceeded to force himself on me. I was crying and telling him to stop, but he didn't stop. I dated him for three months after that, and he continued to pressure me into sex and emotionally abuse me. \n\nStarting at the age of 14-years-old, I began getting harassed online. I stupidly gave out my phone number and address to someone I had trusted, and they were posted on 4chan (a public image board). I was harassed daily: I received death threats; I received threatening phone calls; I would receive calls to my school. I then found out that the person I trusted killed a girl in his home city, and that they had proof I was going to be the next victim. \n\nAt the age of 17, my step-dad physically assaulted me and almost broke my wrist. He put a cigarette out on my head, strangled me, and threatened me. My mom watched, holding the phone, and told me it was my fault for \"not leaving when [she] told [me] to.\" The only help I got was from a neighbor who saw me run out of the house, covered in blood. That same year, I was kicked out because I refused to lift the restraining order off of my step-dad, and my mom gave me an ultimatum.  I refused and went to live elsewhere.\n\nAt the age of 18, I moved in with my first serious boyfriend. He was abusive and cheated on me multiple times. He would call me every name in the book and threaten to harm me and break my belongings. I did not get away until I was just turning 19.\n\nAt the age of 20, I moved in with my dad. My step-mom was jealous of my dad and I's relationship and physically assaulted me and kicked me out on my 21st birthday. My dad did nothing again.\n\nAt the age of 21, I developed life-threatening bulimia and anorexia and began drinking heavily to self-medicate. My fiance helped me through these disorders and saved my life.\n\nI am now 24-years-old and have many stable and healthy relationships--both in friendship and love. I am also receiving help via medication for C-PTSD, GAD, and major depressive disorder. I began therapy recently, too, and am learning to confront my traumas and move on.

story from start to finish\",This is a very tragic and depressing story of a boy who got destroyed and crushed by life\u00a0 society and his family,\"also please bear with me because this is gonna be a long, depressing ride\"\n\nMy name is Mustafa , I'm\u00a0 16 years old and I'm from Egypt.\u00a0\u00a0\n\ni was born in Elshikh_zaeyd city and i lived there for 5 years, then my father decided to take us into a small village\u00a0 Called by Elwasta,this village had alot of dirty people, the kids in my age was saying alot of dirty words and i have learned some of it from them,when i was 7 i had a fight with my older brother (he is older than me with 3 years)&amp;(his name is zaid)\u00a0 and at this time i was so sensitive that i could pass out\u00a0 if my father screamed at me or left me alone at home, i said a dirty word by mistake, so my\u00a0 older brother who's the oldest one of us (lets call him A &amp; he older than me with 9 yrs) took me from hands into his room and locked the room, and he\u00a0 gets the electric iron and turns it on and puted it on my stomach\u00a0 but first with little digress and\u00a0 i was telling him\u00a0 (I'm sorry, I'm sorry) but he didn't take it off,\u00a0 i was screamung so my mom and dad can hear me, so when they heard me and i heard my mother screaming and saying (Stop) i passed out.\u00a0\n\nwhen i woke up i found myself in hospital and there were no one else in the room.\n\nwhen i gone home i asked my parents what are they willing to do to my brother,they said (nothing bcs you said a drity word)\u00a0 then i cried and gone into my room.\n\n2 or 3 momths later i was playing with my brother Zaid and my Brother A comes to play with us and he was literally using my head to break the wall,\u00a0 and i gone to the hospital again bcs my head was opened, my parents told me he didn't do that on purpose.\n\n1 moth later me and my third older brother (his name is Montaser) were playing together and\u00a0 my two brothers decided to join us, we were playing with sticks like they were swords , so my brother A puted the stick on my eyes by mistake this time,and\u00a0 i gone to the doctor and i was okay.\u00a0\n\nwhen i started studying i had to take a lesson next to the moving trains and i was scared of the trains, and one day after I finished my lessons i was going home, but i had to go across the train tracks bcs this is the only way to home, and when i was in the middle of train tracks i saw a train moving towards me,i started running and panic si i felt on the train tracks and opened my head again,so i was crying and the train was coming for me, then there's a man who took me off the train tracks before the train runs over me &amp; took me to the pharmacy (which i used to go alot bcs of\u00a0 my opened head all the time),they thanked him and he left,\u00a0 they puted a paste on my head and told me go home and tell my parents to take me to the hospital.\n\ni gone home crying,\u00a0 my mom opened the door and told me (you deserve it) then i started crying again, i couldn't stop myself from crying, i was way too sensitive,we gone\u00a0 to\u00a0 the hospital and everything was good.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nwhen i was 10 years old my father decided to move to Bani_Suef for no reason,so he rented a house there, and i didn't know any thing about that untill i saw my family packing the bags and collecting everything\u00a0 and they brought a big car to take the baggage, then my mother told me to go to change because we are moving right now,i told her no, i don't want to move,then she told me we have to, i told her why ?!,she said because your father said that!\n\nthen i gone to change and they were leaving, i told my father give me 5 minutes to say goodbye to my friends, he said no,i told him, please!! i won't see them again !! , he screamed at me and said No we are late !!\n\ni gone into a new place full of bad boys in the same age, and i had no friends.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nafter1 year there's a family came and lived behind us, there were a twins in the family and were in my same age,finally i had some friends.\u00a0\n\nme and my new 2 friends were playing in the street every day, i had nothing to do except that, i had no PC or even a phone, actually i don't have a smartphone yet.\n\n\nwhen i was 13 i hated school, but my father forced me to go to school.the school was a holy thing for my father.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nwhatever, i\u00a0 gone to school every single day of the first term &amp; second term too,and someday at the end of the week i was kinda tired because i stayed awake till 2 a.m, i was tired because i was playing football for 3 hours,\u00a0 my father woke me up and i tood him I'm tired,so I'm gonna go to school,\u00a0 then he kept threatening me,and i told him I'm tired i don't wanna go , and there was no one in home except my older brother(A), when i came back to sleep , he took off the blanket and dragged me into the bathroom and kept putting water all over my face and my head , i was screaming (i will not go), then he left me and gone to grab a whip to hit me with it, then I told him I'm tired and I won't go, he starts to hit me with it and i cry and say (I'm not gonna go),but he didn't stop, my older brother oke up on the screaming, he asked my father what's going on, he told him he won't go to school, my older brother told my father let him for me, he took me to the balcony and dropped water all over me and my clothes and closed the balcony's doors, they left me freezing there for about a 45 minutes, then my brother opened the door and told me to wear my clothes, he said you will go to school with these clothes ?, i said i won't go !! , he forced me to go with the wet clothes and i was crying all the way to school,\u00a0 we found the\u00a0 school's gate was closed, then he\u00a0 told me (u won'tgo to school?\u00a0 Fine ! you're not gonna stay at this home again, i will send you to our relatives to work there ), i told him i don't care,\u00a0 so i changed my clothes and gone with him and i had no money, we gone the place of the transportation,\u00a0 we\u00a0 gone to the car then he told me to pay for the place that I'm sitting at, and i told him i don't have any money,then he said(so, fk of the car !!).then i cried and gone there walking, and it's about 25 km from home and about 5:09 hours on legs, i kept walking for 1 or 1:30 an hour, then i found a car that was trying to pick me up, i gone with him and told him what happened, he drove me about 3 hours and half if i was waking,\u00a0 then i gone and thanked him, i continued walking until i gone there, there were no one there because they were at work and school,\u00a0 i waited for them to come, they came and i was so hungry\u00a0 and thirsty, so they fed me and i told them what happened and they told me it's my fault and i should have listened to my father.\n\ni woke up and i ate breakfast then they told me they will drive me home, i told them i don't have home, they said your father's home,i told them i won't go there,but my mother talked to me on the phone and told me (I'm sorry about what happened from your father and your brother, i swear to god they will leave you alone just come home because i miss you),i told her i won't go to school again, she said (as you wish just come),and i gone home because I love my Mother.\n\n\n2.5 years later i was working on a playing centre behind my home, i had a fight with someone there who broke my finger,\u00a0 \u00a0i beated him anyways , whatever\u00a0 there weren't any available Doctors this day, my father and i gone to a man who puts the bones in their place,\u00a0 he fixed my finger but i was worried\u00a0 because I felt that the bones weren't in the right place,\u00a0 2 months i gone to him after he puted that thing around my hand,\u00a0 and i found that my finger wasn't going to heal , so i gone to the doctor with my mother and he asked for an xray\u00a0 of my finger,\u00a0 we made the xray and gone to him again and he said who made this to my finger and kept saying that we should have came for him in the beginning and the man who tried to fix my finger\u00a0 made it worse,\u00a0 the doctor told us that i have to make a surgery to my finger the day after Tomorrow, when i gone home and heard my father telling us to back our bags because we moving into anew house because we were running\u00a0 out of money(the house was rented), he made me leave everything behind again, the new house\u00a0 was nearly in the desert, it's like a ghost town, it was far from everything , when we arrived there\u00a0 were no internet, so i gone to the old town to my friend's\u00a0 home to hangout together, then i posted that I'm going to make a surgery on Facebook\u00a0 to let every person know what happened,after we finished i gone home, i woke up early and i had to not eat for 6 hours before the surgery, me and my mother gone to the hospital to make the surgery,\u00a0 the surgery costs 3.500 thousand Pounds, the serves was so bad,so the doctor made us to go to another hospital,i gone to the surgery roomand the doctor gave me the drug,\u00a0 when i woke up from the surgery i found my phone ringing and he was my friend (Bahaa), he asked about how is things going and if I'm ok or not, i told him it's not bad, i gone home, i slept for 12 hours everyday.\u00a0\n\nnobody visited me or asked about me for like 3 or 4 months, i was 24/7 on the bed and i had nothing to do , i couldn't take a shower for like 2 months, none of my relatives who knew about the surgery came to visit me,i was doing everything alone with one hand, i had all of my bad memories back, i was in pain,\u00a0 i was literally died .\n\nI tried to suicide twice in my life,the first time when i was 14, i was studying hard the whole year to get high degrees because my father told me he would buy me a smartphone,\u00a0 i knew he wouldn't get it for me because he didn't get anything for me when he promised (my father is a big liar),\u00a0 whatever after\u00a0 i have got high degrees my father didn't hive me anything.\nnext day i had a fight with my brother (Zaid), all of my 3 brothers and my father beated me and my mom and my sister were trying to move their away\u00a0 from me, whatever i have got blood from my head and from my nose, so i cried and gone to the roof, and i was gonna jump from the 7Th floor , but my neghbour saved me.\n\nthe second time before the surgery with 3 or 4 months, i had fight with my father,\u00a0 all of my brothers beated me again,\u00a0 this time i accepted the punishment , because i knew i was gonna suicide in the same day. when they all gone to sleep i gone to the roof at 3 am, i kept crying and i was stuck between living or suicides , i remembered that if i suicide i would go to hell, so I didn't wanna lose world &amp; afterlife.\u00a0\n\n\nwhen i was 12, me and my brother (Zaid) were hanging alot together,\u00a0 he had a fight\u00a0 with someone who dropped my ball in the river, the person brought his bigger brother and scratched Zaid's face, then my family had a big fight with their family, whatever they made him apologize for me and my brother, after they gone, my father beated and blamed me for that, he still blames me tho, since that every fight happens with this family my father blames me for it, even when I'm in school.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm known between my friends as \"Fock you\",they are all bigger than me with a year or 2, some of them is older than me with 7 years!! ,it was my ingame name, i loved it when they called me with this name and laughed, it made me kind of happy when i made them smile, so i started being the silliest person between them, because when i be silly person i don't remember the sadness in my life,it was my only way to not be sad,but now some of them don't take me seriously at all, I'm like a clown for them now.\n\n\nI need a new life, new family in a new country, i want some happiness.\nSo yeah, that was a summary of my of my life,  hope I didn't make anyone sad or whatever but I'm in desperate need for help and the internet and people on it are my only hope in this life.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It\u2019s been really slow progress but helpful. I have a few good days and then get in my head. I went through this before and it took me a long time to recover. I don\u2019t want to be in that boat again. \n\nThe biggest struggle is the feeling of inadequacy and just not being enough. My nex was verbally abusive. I didn\u2019t necessarily view it as abuse at the time. He put me down a lot like telling me I wasn\u2019t woman enough for him. He would always comment how I was doing a horrible job of parenting HIS daughter like not putting her to bed correctly. He told me I was fat and told me to get laser hair removal. Made me feel like crap a lot and no matter how hard I tried, it still wasn\u2019t enough or right. He was so critical of everything I did. \n\nThe comment about not being woman enough he said more than once. It stuck with me because I didn\u2019t know how I wasn\u2019t woman enough. One time I asked what he meant, and he said he didn\u2019t mean it like that, whatever that means. I always felt like it was his saying of saying  I wasn\u2019t enough for him not to cheat or settle down. \n\nOne time I went to his place and another woman was there. When I just left his place a few hours before that. He swore he met the woman that very day. And he said I embarrassed him and he could\u2019ve seen a relationship with her. Someone he knew for apparently one day but he questioned if we were even in a relationship and couldn\u2019t commit to me after 7 months? All of it just made me feel like I wasn\u2019t enough. That I\u2019m still not enough. Or was never going to be enough. After I left, he apologized and told me he wanted to talk and not end things like that after he told me all this crappy stuff about me. \n\nI constantly compare myself to someone who doesn\u2019t even exist and wonder what this next person would have had to be enough for him. What did I need to be woman enough? What will she have that I don\u2019t? I think that what he is looking for he will instantly change or at least try to be better. I\u2019ve some how convinced myself he is finally ready to change and he is going to change. \n\nDespite everything he did and who he was, I wonder why I wasn\u2019t enough for him instead of telling myself why he wasn\u2019t enough for me. I feel like I am never going to be enough for anybody.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm a 25-year-old guy that lives with Mom since she has some medical issues and I know how to care for her with that. She's been 'married' to an older man for 15+ years and he emotionally abuses her. Constantly complains about her home and appearance, isolates her from friends and family, yells at her knowing that it triggers her anxiety, and belittles her otherwise.\n\nMom was in a previous abusive relationship with my biological father and also grew up with an alcoholic father and passive mother. (My grandparents were still awesome to me despite this. Mom got her dad clean of drinking and was close with them up till they passed.) What she dealt with from that has shaped her into being fearful of letting go of her current relationship.\n\nI fight quite a bit with Mom's husband  and it's a mutual hatred. I can't stand the way he treats her when she's paying all his bills, keeping the house clean, he works 3 days a week, and whines about giving her any money. (I work a minimum wage job so I do not contribute as much as I'd like myself.) I also get into a few fights with Mom because I can't understand why she puts up with a man who she isn't dependent on.\n\nI need to be more understanding of her. She has a psychiatrist and has been getting therapy for years. How can I be a better son and support my mom instead of being selfish of how it affects me? I want to help my mom through this but I feel overwhelmed and angry at everything in this situation, including myself.

I'd finally found out the truth behind what the fucking shit I've been going through and yet utter sadness that this beautiful amazing woman I love was treated so fucking badly by her family.\n\nThat they didn't emotionally support her enough to feel good about herself.\n\nYou fucking cunts.  I hope you rot in hell.\n\nYou've nurtured a tortured soul.\n\nShe's so fucking needy of attention all the fucking time.\n\nShe loves to reach out to people on facebook when she's bored.\n\nShe knows every trick in the book to hoover people\n\nShe throws a lot of praise at people because people always take kindly to praise and always give supply back.\n\nIt's so annoying.  She'll just love bomb people in 'innocent' ways.  Little mini love bombs...and she'll get back supply.\n\nIt builds her group.  She loves to be loved.\n\nI don't trust her because she is flirty and calculated.\n\nYet, I do all that I can to be her supply.  To support her and actually help with her life.  Helping her with her career and supporting her in this way and that way.  Yet this doesn't translate to anything emotionally.  Anything I do does not translate into anything emotionally.\n\nThe supply well has dried up.\n\nYears ago she betrayed me with another man\n\nThen apologised and cried and got attention and was the victim\n\nThen said it must have been just our relationship\n\nIt wasn't her fault, it was mine basically\n\nWe went to counselling.  She lied to the counsellor.\n\nI forgot about that.\n\nThat's pretty unforgivable.  I'd be so guilty for the rest of my life if I had done something so shitty.\n\nOh wow.  I'm so glad when I think back at this old stuff.\n\nShe doesn't like it when I succeed.\n\nHell, I've seen her actually display signs of bitterness during a little kiddy game when she played with Step daughter once.\n\nHer competitive streak is pathological.  Knee jerk rage and resentment if she loses at anything.\n\nYet complete outward denial of this.  \"I'm the least competitive person ever\".\n\nThe two opposites are completely obvious yet I just carried on in that relationship.  Wow.\n\nShe has devalued me so many times.  The talents she once praised became an object of threat to her later on.  I felt uncomfortable enjoying my hobbies because I felt they threatened her.  Again, this is all built from passive aggressive comments and dismissive behaviours.\n\nOver time you don't want to step on her ego by doing stuff she might be uncomfortable with.\n\nShe can't stand it when someone else is getting attention in the room.  She tries desperately to hide how annoyed she is by it.\n\nShe tries to distract herself by starting a conversation with someone else\n\nShe betrayed my daughter by making her the scapegoat and my bio daughter the golden child.\n\nI was always playing diplomat and peace keeper, trying to show my gf that my daughter was really a good child\n\nHelping my daughter to get in her good graces.  All I wanted was for her to be a positive part of my daughter's life.  I didn't expect her to play mum, but the option was there.  Instead she became the absolute stereotypical wicked step mother.\n\nThe general dynamic (change details for different scenarios but same vibe)\n\nHer - Step-daughter!  Do you think your clothes can walk to the washing basket by themselves?\n\nStep-daughter - No.\n\nHer - Exactly, so why don't you start putting them in there.\n\n\\---------\n\nStep daughter improves and she doesn't acknowledge it.\n\nMe - Did you notice, Step daughter put her clothes in the washing basket.\n\nHer - Oh, she's finally started listening to me at last.\n\nShe never did enough to win my gf's love, because to her, love is conditional and she deliberately set the bar that little bit too high for my daughter to ever reach.  It was so tragic to watch.\n\nMy daughter is such a wonderful child.  She is helpful and caring, artistic and intelligent.  She's so kind and is in love with nature.  She has a great sense of humour and our family is so blessed to have her in our lives.  Her light shines so bright.  I love her more than words can describe.  Everyone she meets says how lovely she is.\n\nAs an infant she drew my GF pictures.  Wanted her to play with her.  She idolised my GF.  Sought validation from her because she saw her as a role model.  My GF was the model step parent of course.  For the first year or so.  Then competitive shit and obstructive shit came into play.\n\nMy GF struggled to relate to her.  Whatever demons she had kept getting in the way of a healthy relationship.  She never ever bonded with her.  Instead she found her to be a threat.\n\nWell fuck you for making me having juggle your fucking ego and my daughter's wellbeing.\n\nMr peace keeper.  She's a beautiful innocent 3 year old.  Why do you want to be enemies?\n\nThen she has the nerve to say \"You disrespect me in front of your daughter.\"\n\nNo, I was trying to support her because you were such a fucking cruel bitch talking like a petulant adult to a young child who has no idea how to respond to the sarcastic shaming questions you threw at her.  I tried talking to you off the record to teach you healthy discipline methods and you never fucking listened, and I'm not going to let you talk to my daughter like that with no one to back her up.\n\nYou saw how I disciplined her yet you ignored it.\n\nShe kept stressing how fucking hard it is to be a step parent.  After 6 years.  She was still saying it.\n\n\"why does she do that?\"\n\n\"why do you do that?\"\n\n\"Why is she jumping into the bed cuddling you?  That's weird.\"\n\n\"I think she's trying to annoy me deliberately\"\n\nToxic shit.\n\nI feel so ashamed I let my daughter down.  I tried to be the mediator.\n\nIt caused so many arguments.  Eventually I asked google why I can't communicate with her, why she's so hyper defensive and why she can never see my side of things.\n\nWe all find this sub for a reason.  A concrete reason.\n\nI am now showing my daughter that sometimes it's hard to leave a relationship but it has to be done.  I'm repairing my mistakes as best I can.\n\nI was still with her, until today.\n\nToday I wrote the message and just sent it before I could change my mind.\n\nI had two chances to turn back, and stay\n\nBut she was so awful the night before\n\nToo long to explain but she COMPLETELY rewrote 2 years of our relationship...\n\nIn a couple of sentences....\n\nShe completely changed the past.  I was now suddenly a completely different person and she was the victim of some kind of abuse.  Yet I was always reeling from her abuse.  WTF.\n\nA year ago I was reduced to practically nothing. I completely lost myself, and for the first time in my whole life I actually felt like I needed to go to a doctor about the way I was feeling.\n\nYet 24 hours ago, when she was describing our past, it was she who was the victim of abuse.....\n\nAt the hands of me.\n\nThen I realised that there is no hope for us.  I mean I knew it anyway, but that was too scary.\n\nImagine if I stayed 10 years more...and she rewrote that too.\n\nSo now I'm free.\n\nI feel very happy...but if I let the sadness get to me then I get VERY sad.\n\nIf I keep it at bay I'm ok.\n\nI feel like I want to cry.

When we started seeing each other and were only in the talking phase he was very sweet and would say things like \u201cit\u2019s like we\u2019re the same person\u201d used terms of endearment early on. I fell for these hard. He would often compliment my taste in music and even the car I drive etc. But once we got to know each other more he started belittling my taste in music and if I let him drive my car he would say how slow it was. He even started insulting my mannerisms and say things like \u201cwhy do you do that?\u201d and \u201cWow you\u2019ve actually done that?!\u201d  \n\n   At one point when I wanted to DTR I noticed he was texting another girl while we were hanging out. Later that night when I brought up the prospect of a relationship he told me he wasn\u2019t ready. I knew who he had been texting and I was suspicious that she was a romantic interest of his from other signs I had seen. I questioned him the morning after asking if she was the reason he didn\u2019t want to DTR and he avoided the question at first saying \u201cI know two girls with that name?!\u201d even though it was very obvious I was talking about the girl he was texting the night before. and said \u201cshe\u2019s kinda weird and we don\u2019t have a lot in common.\u201d And said the conversation was mundane and agreed to an exclusive relationship. Would this be considered gaslighting? It totally changed my perception of the situation and made me feel crazy. Other incidents occurred similar to this where I would question his loyalty due to him being very secretive and at one point lying to me about his whereabouts which I called him out on and he again made me feel like I was crazy for bringing it up. (This whole thing has been a learning experience about red flags)\n\n   At the start he would pick me up and take me out on dates (I later realized he never called them that) we would meet for lunch, go to museums, I met some of his friends and we would spend all day together sometimes. This made me think we were headed towards a relationship. He later said we were just \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d and that having sex early on confused things, I really made me question everything and the way he felt towards me. I was so confused. Towards the end I felt unappreciated and brought it up to him but he dismissed my concerns and told told me it was a lot to read and that he didn\u2019t have the time at the moment said things to make me feel like I was wrong for bringing it up. It seemed like he couldn\u2019t set his pride aside to reassure me. We later discussed changing our dynamic and not focusing on sex. We agreed but he became distant/rude. I asked if we could hang out over the weekend and he said he didn\u2019t have time which I knew was a lie. I wanted to see if he would reach out to me as I would usually initiate communication but it was almost two days with nothing from him. I then reached out but was still getting the same distant and cold response. Terms of endearment weren\u2019t used and I felt worthless. I felt like a clingy mess of a person. \n\n   I talked with a friend who told me that this wasn\u2019t healthy and I should consider ending it. I explained how he didn\u2019t want a relationship while I did and that it wasn\u2019t fair or healthy for me especially after his attitude towards me changed when we decided not to focus on sex. He said he was sorry for being a \u201cdumbass\u201d and that he hoped I didn\u2019t hate him and apologized for being immature. He later blocked me on all social media\u2019s and my number but recently unblocked me but only on one social media website.\n\n   Part of me wonders if this is a classic idealize, devalue, discard and stonewall (with gaslighting) or if he was just immature and emotionally unavailable.

Why I was so crazed by the end. It\u2019s from years and years of ranting, attacking letters like the one I\u2019ll quote below.

Of course, my lack of desire couldn\u2019t me because of his years of physical and emotional abuse, cheating, etc, it was because I was \u201cnot a real woman,\u201d frigid, etc. So he would constantly rant about this, and threaten to leave over it. He also was positive that I was too weak or venal leave.

It\u2019s almost unreal now, which somehow helps me to be grateful for what I have now. This particular letter was followed by him coming to the bedroom and screaming threats at me until I had sex with him, all right outside the kids\u2019 bedroom doors as they yelled at him to stop, they were trying to sleep.

I\u2019ve missed an absurd amount of school, and it has been awful going to school with my ex who did these awful things to me.  A mandatory reporter got a hold of the situation, reported it, and we got a call from the police.  I decided not to file a report.  I recently told my assistant principal (who is also my world civ teacher so we have a relationship where I was comfortable telling if it meant it would help me) so my schedule could be changed in order to not be in the same classes as my abuser (i did not give a name to my assistant principal so the school would not contact his family, though i believe he already knows who it is).  This worked, and since the police already contacted us (us being my family), they informed us that if it was reported again, they won\u2019t have to contact us since they talked with us and i decided not to report.

I just need to get it out of my chest for the very first time. \nMentions of depression, suicide, self harm, murder, rape. \n\nSo it all started summer 2017, as i've been really depressed for a year with me being alone in college and family stuff eating me alive for years.\nMy doctor suggested i go into a psych ward for light pathologies and i off i went. I was in a place where my parents thought i faked it because i didn't want to go to college anymore and also depression isn't a disease, so right there i tell them that if i don't go i can't last two months before killing myself.\nSo i arrive in this actually cool facility, with bath therapy, massage and a beautiful park, and it's all girls in here. So i meet the rest of the weirdos like me and it looks like a sleepover when everyone is taking meds and we do stuff like group therapy, crochet classes, massages, music, walks around the Park, arts and crafts. I'm starting to befriend a group of girls that were the closest to my age (i'm 20F at the time).\nThis girl, let's name her Esmeralda (27F), is cool, i don't ask her why she's here and she doesn't either. We start to talk and become friends, we're both caffeine and cigarettes addicts, we go to activities together for a week or so. Then we exchange phone numbers and we realize soon enough we're into each other. Honey moon phase begin, we laugh and hide to kiss, she introduces me to her father as a friend 4 days after first kiss. He looks concerned about his daughter, polite and caring. Let's call him John.\nShe introduce me to her roommate Rose. They bought a house together after both escaping violent relationship. Now she tells me she's here because her ex hubby hit here multiple times, leaving her in a wheelchair for two mobths, raped her, sometimes with objects that led her to have a lifetime of vagina issues like probably not being able to have a baby. Also her mother killed her baby brother when he was 3 and she was 10 by drowning him and trying to do it to her next.\n\nI'm like wow that's a lot in one take and i don't think i can help you being me right now but i'll be there because i really like you.\nSo weeks went by and we grow very close, and at one point i suspect she's harming herself so i ask her why she kept her shirt on during sex, why'd she have a bandaid on her belly and she opens up and admit it. So i tell her to mention it to her psychologist or i will. She does, and eventually stops.\nAugust comes by and the doctor goes off for holidays and the substitute comes in. He starts with changing meds of a third of the patients. He heavily sedated me with anti anxiety meds (which i never needed), and switch the only antidepressant my body tolerated. So i'm on edge and going nuts for nothing. And Esmeralda gets her doses times 3 now. She starts to tell him she doesn't want all of his meds and she's not the kind type so she just yells at him that he's a dick and she's not gonna eat up that much med. So he denies her to go to activities and have her lock up in her room.\nShe didn't want to so pretend to go to the bathroom and got off a balcony to the activities (at the balcony  you could access the roof, it was in a soft slope to the garden and was barely above ground level so no danger here).\nThe doctor took security with him to get esmeralda who was a 45kg girl, he tied her up in a suicide safety room and gave her meds (i talked about it with a nurse and he gave her the dose for a 110kg male).\n\nSo for three days she can't walk, then when she can say her name she is sent to another facility (without her consent or her fathers) that is kinda ghetto and we can't see her or mention her since she's a \"suicide risk\".\nAt that point i think she's the one, i call her dad (3 days later nobody had called him), give him her location, i book the next train to that city and i call for a friend to come pick me up at the station and ask if ican stay over at his place.\nThis was a facility that welcomed only voluntary patients so i never was forced to stay or anything.\nFast forward to where i get there, they say she's okay, never been suicidal, she can go whenever she wants and she stays for a week more.\nShe asks me to move in with her as soon as we find an appartement, she wants to sell her half of the house. I agree and we search. \nThe day she got out we got in her car and she got a call from the roommate. She tried to kill herself but survived, she's in the ER. So off we go (she couldn't drive yet, because meds), we get her clothes, stuff for the psych ward (another city, the third one so far so i could do some yelp reviewing maybe) and she say you can't leave me, come to my house for a few days. I agree, i come by my parents place, take everything that i care about that can fit into one luggage ( the one you can take with you on planes). A few days later, the roommate Rose comes back and she welcomed me saying just move in with us, just girls battling together against life. Alright then.\n\nNow Esmeralda says that Rose is kinda jealous so we can't tell her we're dating. And they share a room with two beds upstairs, while i sleep alone downstairs. Rose feels better, seems like having trouble with two custody battles took a toll on her, i don't judge.\nLife goes by, a month maybe, and Esmeralda and i grow really serious, like she asked me to marry her and we're talking kids (semen donor cost a lot of money so we start thinking, and she doesn't want to have a child after 30). We're still searching for a rent but it's never the right time and i get it. But never sleeping with my gf comes to really piss me off, and also i start to think Rose is in love with Esmeralda.\n\nFast forward to october, nothing changed, but one of her friends owes Esmeralda money and she really needs it. He asks her to come over for dinner with old friends and she'll get her money. She comes and all the friend made a group gift, worth 500\u20ac, the exact amount he owes her. At the end of the night she tells him the gift is really sweet but it's something for her car and it's not the right type so he'll need to exchange it. Then he starts going touchy with her, saying he could give her gifts everyday if she was his gf. She says no, give him the 'you're my friend speech' and he says that's it you're not getting no gift and no money. He grabs her arm and tell her to go away.\nFor the two next weeks he proceeds to tell her he loved her one time, another that she got what she deserved with ex hubby, and one last that he'll never repay her.\nShe said well i'll talk to him he'll see if he can fuck around with me.\nI drive her to his place thinking she's gonna threaten him with police and then sweettalk him into giving the money (She was the best for sweet talking). I wait in the car and that's when shit hits the fan. Really hard.\nShe comes back and asks me roughly to JUST DRIVE. I do and stop like 15 km away in the countryside, i turn the light on and she has blood on her clothes. Telling me how he tried to push her too far and she didn't hurt him, it was just a cutter and it didn't go in so deep, like 3cm.\nI'm like WTF i never slapped anyone for my whole life and now i'm an accomplice !\n\nShe begs me to not tell Rose if i really loved her and i did. Next day police show up at the door saying Esmeralda, someone accused you of assault and she plays innocent and cops didn't see the 45kg sweet faced girl as a threat so they tell her there will be a meeting next week.\nThey leave and she calls a \"friend from highschool\" who plays rugby, has a thing for her and has violent tendencies (lovely gentleman) and gives him the address of touchy friend. Says \"he owes me 500\u20ac,get them back for me will you ? Also he tried to rape me last time, threatened my life and now cops are after me\". I was so shocked, like was he gonna kill him ? Did i just saw her order a murder ? Was there someone out there ready to do this for her ?\nShe reassured me he was going to shake him and scare him, nothing more. So when police meeting comes, touchy friend is in the hospital so he can't testify, and also he called to withdraw his complaint.\n\nI didn't mention it earlier but she always did emotionial blackmailing like 'if you really loved me you would do this',, pointing my every flaw, criticizing and belittling me, lying and manipulating people around her. So i've come to think that everything she told me isn't true. Like maybe part of her childhood stories, maybe the bff part or some other random stuff, as well as all the shit she said about me after all of this. \n\nAt this time Esmeralda's bff (who she met throught work and also had an abusive ex) was coming back to see her (she lived overseas) and they scheduled stuff together.\nWe made some visits for a rent but she thinks we can't leave now because Rose is not so good.\nBff comes around, they go for a meal and kiss each other goodnight, as she was staying at a hotel nearby.\n\nNext morning ER calls in saying bff is in a coma for unknown reasons, near death, so we go. I'll sum up the bff story that went on for the next 2 months : she got transferred to a better hospital and died but somehow they revived her but had to amputate 2m of her intestines, they learn that she was raped then forced to drink a bottle of bleach to kill her, all of this probably by the violent ex who somehow learned that she came back around for a week. She got better for a month, was working on a deposition for cops but died. It could have been because of the surgery two months prior or maybe someone that finished the job (catholic mom never wanted an autopsy). All suposeldy because Rose and I never saw her. \n\nIn the same timeline, i put two and two together (i wasn't the brightest when love blinded me) and realize from a chat with Rose that ESMERALDA AND ROSE ARE ENGAGED AND TRYING TO HAVE A BABY. Rose asks me to be her witness as we grew closer since 4 months now. The same promises she made to me she made to her. They've been together for 5 years, the bed number two is for her daughter when she had her in custody.\nI'm so shocked i don't know what to say. Rose tells me that they were pretty secretive about their love life, because of ex hubbies and homophobia in general. I get that she's so blind to me staring with love at Esmeralda, as blind as i was.\nI'm stranded in the backcountry in that house, no car of my own and no place to go (except my friend that is 1 hour away in car). \nThe same day i go to the bank and closed an account my mother opened me when i was born, wich has 4000\u20ac in it and i scroll through used cars ads.\nRose got to work the next day and as soon as she left i say to Esmeralda everything i had in mind. She told me not to worry, she was about to drop her but didn't want her to kill herself, she was just pretending, not even enjoying the sex, she promised. \nFor me that was the last straw, she cheated on the both of us under the same roof ?! I honestly don't know how, but she sweettalked me into keeping a low profile until we found a rent, she loved me and stuff, how she felt forced to have sex with Rose, running off of excuses to avoid sex, how she had a really rough time in her life... She guilt tripped me into saying i didn't want Rose to die so that was it.\nFrom that day, everytime i found a place to rent she would say it's shit, she would be really condescending, saying i was stupid and naive and everything not brand new, under 500\u20ac/month and 75m2 was a hellhole.\nSo i'm searching, not realising it doesn't exist, because i'm naive and i've only lived at my parents or in a college dorm.\nOne day i find the holy grail or the closest thing to ever exist and she says it's shit, also can't leave Rose in this state and also we don't have a budget for new equipements and furniture.\nI've worked since i was 16, college is free and my parents paid for everything so i have something like 3000\u20ac of savings so i say that's enough right ?\nShe start to say random prices really high for furniture and equipments, and when i found some cheaper she would say, let's guess it... IT'S SHIT.\nBy that point, Rose is having suspiscion of Esmeralda dating a man in the next town over. I' m so full of self hate for doing this to Rose but i just can't stop, i love her. Rose is trying to involve me into the wedding and Esmeralda is ordering me to do as she pleases, if i truly love her.\nI spotted a man selling his car, so i go and just asks him if he'd do a 500\u20ac discount if i give cash to him right now and he agrees.\nI drive home, surprising everyone. I talk to Esmeralda in private to say i will leave the house soon and she goes wild with rage, saying i can't leave her here, i made a promise to wait. So i say, in three days i leave, with you or not.\nThe sale night there is an event in the village and we go, thinking it could be nice. Esmeralda goes hammered, running into the woods alone (she did that once, leaving me alone to search her, and another one where her drivers license was suspended for a run in with the police). Rose and i searched her for 2 hours then figured out she'd come back when she would need a smoke. She was answering her phone, going wild about how her father drove her mom so crazy she killed her brother, about how he cheated on her mother with a dude and when Esmeralda saw him he said to her he'd kill her if she ever spoke about it, he wore women's clothes on his days off the construction sites... And when her mother tried to reach out to her family to be hospitalized they said to get her life together, start attracting the husband instead of leaving him to go to brothels and toughen up. Then Esmeralda rant about how we were bitches, no one loved her. We asked her so many times where she was, if she was safe, she just yells insults at us. I didn't drink so i took the car. I found her a 5am walking with a knife trying to go to her father's house to kill him.\n\nI get her home safely, thinking tomorrow i'll take her back to the hospital because this shit is beyond my ability. And Esmeralda straight up tries to fuck me, in the living room, while Rose in in the upstairs bedroom and probably heard us come home. She 'shshshsh it's okay' to me while undressing me, i say no several times and she still tries, then hold my arms so i can't resist. I say i'll yell if she doesn't let me go, then she just cries and tries to make me feel guilty for not loving her enough. We argued until sunlight about how i was the worst person she ever met, i didn't love her enough, that she how disgusted me so much that i couldn't bare to touch her. When she finally dozes off, i gathered my stuff and drove off. Never once looked back.\nI adopted a puppy from her and that's the only thing i've got from this relationship. She tried to reach out to me to make me feel guilty about me not wanting to stay friends, not sending pics of the dog.\nI've never told Rose about the whole thing because i didn't want her to relapse but mostly because i think they built something now, she got her two kids back, they got financially on tracks, i think they're married now. I feel incredibly shameful and terrible for being the mistress, i disgusted myself for a really long time.\nNow i'm engaged to my boyfriend and we're really happy.\n\nThank you A LOT for reading everything, i needed this to be out, i'm absolutely sure i left so much details out but i'm glad this case is closed.\n\n\nTLDR: fell for a girl in a psych ward, we move in together with recovering roommate, we got engaged and i discover she's engaged with the roommate and planning for a baby, i have no place to stay and no car to go away", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He\u2019s supposed to be taking medicine, especially a mood stabilizer, but now he claims that he\u2019s not bipolar, and that he doesn\u2019t have anything wrong with him. Even when he was prescribed medicine, he wouldn\u2019t take it. For example his doctor prescribed him a new mood stabilizer. He said it made him feel sick and nauseous. When he went back to his dr, he told her and she said that\u2019s not even a side effect.\n\n11. He drinks, often. He used to be an alcoholic, but got over that. Promised he was quitting. But has occasional beers, and every once in awhile he\u2019ll drink a whole case on the weekends. When I asked him about him quitting, he said he has quit. An occasional beer doesn\u2019t count he says.\n\n12. Every single time we have an argument and come close to breaking up, he always says how he\u2019s gonna get a new girl and all that. He\u2019s said plenty of times that he knows a lot of girls that want to be with him.\n\n13. I feel like he lies to me. One thing I\u2019ve tried to get the truth out of him is how many girls he\u2019s been with. We live in a small community where everybody knows everybody. He claims to have been such a man whore (his words, not mine) but every single girl he\u2019s supposedly been with wasn\u2019t from around here. He says he\u2019s lost count. When I ask for names to see if they exist, they don\u2019t have Facebook\u2019s, or instagrams, or anything at all.\n\nThat\u2019s just a small list of things. I\u2019m so tired of being unappreciated and being unhappy with life. I feel like everything\u2019s all my fault.

Since I was 15, he systematically broke my brain into thinking I was stupid, ugly, gross, incapable, incompetent, unliked, didn't deserve and never was going to get love, etc etc etc\n\nLast year, after an specif episode of his, I understood what was happening and put an end to this friendship.\n\nI haven't talked to him in over a year, blocked him in all social media - MY LIFE HAS NEVER BEEN FUCKING BETTER (this is literally my most succesfull year).\n\nRecently, he reached out to my best friend in the world, who was also a friend of his. He said \"he needed closure\" and that he felt the need to talk to me to either \"we go back to being friends or go our ways, but with closure\".\n\nThe friend in common (that has seen a lot of mental breakdowns of mine because of the abuser) said he \"couldn't speak for me\" and when the abuser asked him the \"review the message\" before he sent it to me, he denied it.\n\nA few weeks later (two days ago), my bff told me this happened.\n\nTwo days later I told him very clearly that he should know I don't want to talk with said abuser and I don't want any tyoe of contact. \n\nThe thing is, there is this tiny fraction in my mind that's curious about what he has to say.\n\nI mean, I know it's probably the \"honeymoon phase\" where he'll admit to all of the bullshit he made, he'll say that he's been going to therapy, he'll say a lot of nice and seemingly coherent things.\n\nI think this fraction of me is curious but I also know that it'll be fake because I've been posting A LOT of rants on facebook this past year, talking about what he did to me and how I felt and how I rised up against it. I don't name him personally and he's blocked but I know he see the posts tru his wife facebook and friends in common.\n\nSo, if he reads my rants, he knows how I feel about him, he knows how I refer to what he did to me. Why would he think \"we could go back to being friends\"? This doesn't make any sense?!?! I mean, if I was guessing, before he contacted my bff, I would bet he was very angry at me for refering to him as an abuser as a psychopat, etc etc\n\nIs it him being condescendent? Is it a plot to talk to me and show that's actually mad?\n\nI have severe anxiety (I've had it all my life but he certainly made it 100 times worse) and can't stop thinking about.\n\nIt also botters me that I think he knows he has this effect (that a simple \"reach\" to a friend in common would make me go on a crazy spiral of wondering) and that this could be yet another way of him attacking me, from affar.\n\nAnyway, thougth you guys might have something to say about it that could help \"come back\".", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I\u2019m still pretty new here, but I basically realized my ex was a narcissist a little less than two weeks ago. Until that point, I still thought there was a good person inside of her who was just waiting to come out. Over the last two weeks I\u2019ve been reading nonstop about narcissists and it\u2019s really sinking in exactly how bad everything was. Tonight, it fully sank in for the first time that she was and is a full blown narcissist.\n\n**So I\u2019m sorry in advance, but this is going to be SUPER TLDR!**\n\n**Read at your own risk!**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything just really fully hit me and sank in tonight, and I just have to talk to other people who can understand what it feels like to realize the person you were so in love with was actually a narcissist.\n\nTonight, I\u2019ve finally really realized the full implications of everything in my previous relationship.\n\nI realize exactly what it means... that I was with a narcissist...and I really hate myself tonight for feeling so torn up about a human predator.\n\nI can\u2019t stop kicking myself tonight now that I realize exactly what a narcissist is and realizing that I let myself fall in love with one. So, here it goes...\n\nIt\u2019s been about 2 weeks since I found this community and really started reading up about narcissistic personality disorder and cluster b personality types, and realized that my nex girlfriend perfectly fit every descriptor of the narc personality type.\n\nI don\u2019t get it. I mean, I didn\u2019t even fall for her scam! I saw it right off the bat! That\u2019s part of what\u2019s making me feel so upset right now -  I normally see right through people who have bad intentions!\n\nI always see through them - even the seemingly nicest people that all of my friends or coworkers or whatever think are cool, all throughout the most recent years of my life, if they've got bad intentions I can (almost) ALWAYS figure out whether or not that's the case and if they intend anyone harm or are fundamentally bad people, usually as soon as I meet them.\n\nAnd then thing is, in retrospect... I could sense it with nex right off the bat, too.\n\nThat realization is stinging so bad right now.\n\nI remember, I had this very slight bad feeling about her when I first met her.\n\nBut I covered it up. I buried it SO deep. I refused to see it.\n\nEVERY SINGLE TIME that she did something fucked up, or cruel, or mean, or heartless, just something that you would never do to someone you absolutely hated, let alone the person you claimed to love the most in the world, I ALWAYS made an excuse for it.\n\nIn my mind, she was always just hurt, or a lost soul, or just finding her way and needed to grow up more but once she did, OH MAN, THEN she would really understand what she had done and then she would be so sorry, because I just KNEW that she was a good person deep down.\n\nI just knew...didn\u2019t I?\n\nI just knew that, deep down inside, she knew everything cruel and mean and inhuman that she did to me, the guy that she said she had loved more than anyone else before in her life, and wanted to have a family with, and all this stupid fucking bullshit...\n\nOh, ohhhhh I KNEW that deep down, she knew how bad it all was and she was processing it and she had a soul that was just buried so deep down that it hadn\u2019t seen the light of day in forever, but it was taking note of every bad thing she did and it was keeping a tally.\n\nI don't really understand... Why did I do that to myself?\n\nWhy did I give her permission to treat me that way?\n\nDidn\u2019t I respect myself even a little bit? That\u2019s all I can think about tonight... It\u2019s driving me insane. Why did I listen to her words when she told me she was a good person?\n\nShe ALWAYS told me how kindness and being a good person and being selfless were her highest virtues...\n\nShe wanted to make the world a better place, she told me.\n\nThen I would watch as her actions spoke to the complete opposite. I watched as she behaved as one of the MOST selfish people I\u2019ve EVER met before - she would secretly take the last slice of pizza when she thought no one was looking, as long as no one could see what she was doing she would always do stuff like that, she would always be 100% selfish as long as she thought no one would find out.\n\nShe would ALWAYS try and turn the conversation back on her, no matter WHAT was happening, WITHOUT FAIL!\n\nIf someone\u2019s parents had just died in a car accident, she would turn the conversation back on her about how that was SO horrible for her to hear!\n\nNex: *\u201cAnd oh my god, I can SO totally relate, I accidentally wore the wrong pair of shoes today that totally didn\u2019t match my outfit and I didn\u2019t look nearly as hot as I normally could, so yeah I\u2019ve probably actually had a worse day than you have, dead parents friend! As a matter of fact, I\u2019m upset at YOU for trying to steal the spotlight for YOURSELF with your lousy dead parents because today my 50k thirsty as fuck male instagram followers who are DMing me nonstop every day only got to see me looking 95% as hot as I normally do - so you know, I\u2019ve actually had a WORSE day than you have! But of course you with your dead parents, you only ever think about yourself! WOW! How can SOME PEOPLE be SO selfish...!? What a world we live in... It\u2019s so hard to be a good person like myself. Ark, you\u2019re SO lucky to have such an amazing person like me as your girlfriend.\u201d*\n\nI\u2019m only slightly exaggerating there, too...\n\nI feel SO fucking dirty and disgusted just rereading that last paragraph and realizing that there\u2019s a more than zero chance that my nex would say something like that.\n\nI feel so disappointed in myself for allowing someone who was so the opposite of everything I value in other people to actually get that close to me and make me feel so sad that they discarded me.\n\nEvery. Single. Fucking. Time. She would say something THAT selfish or something approximating it, I would ALWAYS make an excuse for her. Every fucking time! Every time she would say the most disgustingly selfish, heartless, cruel thing you could imagine.\n\nI\u2019ve never gone through hoops like that for anyone else that I ever thought had even a sniff of a bad vibe like that or bad intentions, I\u2019ve always called them out immediately and refused to be around them if I could help it. But for some reason, she had all these damn sob stories for why she was so totally self absorbed.\n\n...And I totally bought into every single one. They weren\u2019t even GOOD sob stories, in retrospect.\n\nI and any of my good friends have \u201csob\u201d stories 10x sadder than anything she ever said, but we never share them with anyone other than our VERY close friends - and we would CERTAINLY never use anything bad that had happened to us in the past as a justification for being an objectively bad person in the present.\n\nI keep trying to think of the 2 or 3 times she did something that wasn\u2019t completely selfish and for her own best interests, and using that as an excuse for the rest of her actions. Even on a short list, I could list literally HUNDREDS of nasty, selfish, horrible and cruel things that she did.\n\nA long list would be pages and pages and pages of awful stuff.\n\nBut...\n\nI sat there, and I made excuses for her.\n\nGod. I feel so, SO stupid. So disappointed in myself... Now that I know what a narcissist is, now that I KNOW that she never really loved me, or could feel love, or had any of those good traits that I kept projecting onto her...\n\nFuck.\n\nI just thought that...I dunno. That the horrible narcissist that she seemingly was on the surface...well, was just the surface.\n\nI thought there was a good person beneath all of that.\n\nI thought that... That she had just seen the worst of humanity, and that she was responding as someone who had been traumatized would probably respond to the rest of the world.\n\nI just thought, she only needs to have someone really love her genuinely - she needs to see that there are good people in the world, and she\u2019ll be able to let her real genuine self out, the good person that I know she is.\n\nIt sounds strange, but before all of this, I was secretly hoping that we could still be together at some point, even through all of the bad.\n\nReally, I didn\u2019t think that people like narcissists actually existed. I still thought everyone had some good in them, deep down. I didn\u2019t think that real human predators like that were actually around - I mean, you see news stories about horrific things that people do to other people, but it always seemed like it\u2019s something far away that you can\u2019t really relate to, at least not in a personal way, for me.\n\nI mean, I\u2019ve known REALLY terrible people in my life.\n\nI\u2019m related to several, I\u2019ve worked with them at jobs, I\u2019ve gone to school with people that I\u2019ve known were objectively awful human beings. But...I\u2019d never met someone like that, and then been in love with them, and given them my whole heart and tried to give them the world, and then had them take that as a sign of weakness and do worse things to me than my worst enemies ever have, and have ZERO remorse.\n\nNo, not only have zero remorse - actually, and genuinely, believe in their heart that \\*I\\* was the one who was at fault for the terrible things that they chose to do to me.\n\nEach time she posted up a picture of a new guy she was with, each time she talked about how happy she was with them, each time she posted about how much she loved them...I dunno. In the back of my mind, I always felt a weird feeling like I felt she was always still in love with me and just doing it to hurt me, because I was the one she loved the most...and that fantasy made me feel some weird twist of validation.\n\nIt sounds so weird and fucked up - and it is - but I\u2019m sad that now I realize she didn\u2019t even think about me at all with those guys, that she legitimately was just onto a new target and most likely never even thought of me again.\n\nAnd now? I just feel stupid.\n\nLike a big, stupid, ugly ogre.\n\nAnd still, STILL I can\u2019t believe that I LET this happen to myself.\n\nWhen I was a kid (and tell me if you all can relate), I would always watch these lifetime original movies with my mom, where it\u2019d be a woman who was totally in love with an obviously horribly abusive guy, and all of her friends (and the entire audience) would KNOW the guy was an evil abusive piece of shit, and the woman would always fight to the death about how she knew that horrible evil piece of shit was really a good guy and just no one understood him like she did. I would always watch those movies with my mom and always be so frustrated, thinking - how could ANYONE be so dumb!? How could ANYONE not see what that guy really is?! How could anyone allow a selfish, awful piece of shit like that into their life and not be able to see what they really are!?\n\nNow I can 100% understand those characters in those lifetime movies. And...\n\n...And,  I hate that I can relate to them and understand why they were fooled by those evil people.\n\nI look back on everything myself, and I see how obvious it was that my nex was everything those guys in those movies were.\n\nAbusive, selfish, uncaring, users...human predators that prey on good caring people who wanted to reach out and help heal them.\n\nI fought off being angry about this and accepting that my nex girlfriend knew exactly what she was doing and didn\u2019t REALLY care about me whatsoever the whole time, for such a long time.\n\nThe ONE thing I didn\u2019t want to happen from our breakup, was for me to become angry and bitter and upset about everything, and let it bleed into any future relationships I had.\n\nAs painful as my broken heart felt, I just wanted to forgive her for everything and just be understanding.\n\nI wanted to understand that she wasn\u2019t mature enough to handle what she was doing yet, but now that I understand what she really is - a narcissistic cluster b personality - I know the truth.\n\nI know that she knew \\*exactly\\* what she was doing, the WHOLE time, and that she just saw me as a victim to take advantage of...as someone to use and then discard and never give closure to. And that realization makes me so upset.\n\nThe fact that there are people out there who would take advantage of others like that, people that they claimed to love and be so close to. It makes me so upset that there is an entire group of people out there in the world that parasitically leech off of and wound caring people who only want to help them and love them - that\u2019s so fucking disgusting. It\u2019s SO deeply upsetting to me on such a personal level.\n\nI mean...I dunno. I really don\u2019t. I think I\u2019m just...I feel so burnt out.\n\nAnyway...\n\n\\---------------------\n\nThanks if you\u2019ve read this far - and I\u2019m sorry if I went on a huge tangent tonight. Like I said - the full reality of having been in love with a narcissist finally REALLY hit me tonight, and...well, I feel pretty emotional.\n\nBut even though I realized something so heartbreaking, I\u2019m so glad I found this community of people who I can tell this to, who might understand where I\u2019m coming from - what I\u2019m feeling.\n\nI really can\u2019t tell you guys how appreciative I am that you all share your stories and are here for everyone else who\u2019s going through the same thing as well. No one else has ever really understood what this feels like, that I\u2019ve talked to...until now.\n\nFor the longest time, I thought there was something really wrong with me. Why couldn\u2019t I get over my nex? There was so much cognitive dissonance over what she told me and the way she acted, and then the full discard where the girl who insisted I was the love of her life, just up and left with a shitty explanation that didn\u2019t really explain anything.\n\nLiterally NO ONE I knew understood what I felt.\n\nIt\u2019s really really painful for me right now realizing the full implications of the woman I finally wanted to have a family with, having been a narcissist  the whole time, who was putting on a show of being exactly who I wanted my perfect partner to be.\n\nBUT, that\u2019s only in the very short term - I feel like now that I know exactly what happened to me, it\u2019s like I\u2019m waking up from a nightmare that I wouldn\u2019t let myself even be aware of before. Like a horrible spell was cast on me that has finally been broken.\n\nI\u2019m really hurt right now realizing that my relationship was essentially all a big con, but on the other side it\u2019s so comforting to finally understand what had happened with my nex. Now I can feel like it really is just a temporary pain, as intense as it feels right now, and breaking the illusion of what I thought I had before, I can finally open my eyes from what felt like an endless waking nightmare.\n\nI can open my eyes and see the world again for the sweet, beautiful place that it is.\n\nSo yeah...thank you, everyone.\n\nSo much.\n\nYou\u2019ve helped me more than you\u2019ll ever know.\n\nI only hope that, in time, I can give back a fraction of the hope you\u2019ve all given me. You\u2019re great  - every single one of you. The fact that someone saw your kindness as a weakness and wanted to take advantage, doesn\u2019t mean it is at all. Don\u2019t let the predators who pretended to be what you wanted the most, take away your best quality. The person you\u2019re going to meet who\u2019s going to be the REAL genuine love of your life, will actually appreciate it and genuinely love you for it.\n\nYou are someone who is going to get all the love you thought this impostor was giving you. It\u2019ll take a little while longer, but it\u2019s on the way. Don\u2019t let the predators hurt the person you were actually meant for.

One thing I would be interested in getting others perspectives on is; why would a person with fairly severe covert narcissism go to concerts so frequently? Over the last two years he has become more reclusive and detached from any sort of social engagement. He does not leave the house almost at all at this point (he also works from home). He is a very heavy cannabis user, he drinks maybe once or twice a week and also has been using some cocaine by himself.\n\nHe has always been a concert goer but at this point it is the only thing he ever does. We live in a major city so there are shows basically every night of the week. This week a lone he has gone to three shows. Between october and november there were nine shows he wants or wanted me to go with him to. When I don't go he guilts and feels victimized. The bands he wants to see usually aren't even bands he likes. He barely seems like he enjoys them when he goes. He is no longer reaching out to other people we know, he seems almost obsessed with me specifically going to these shows with him. This is not a person i'm dating or anything, we are both straight adult males.\n\nWhat i'm wondering is why the concerts? I have a couple of theories. For one, there is a guaranteed outcome so he has control over his experience. He gets to pay for his experience and what he wants to happens, happens. I've seen this with him and other narcissist. They don't really want to create they just want to feed off experiences while not contributing much, usually just contributing money.\n\nSecond, I believe going to concerts prevents him from having to actually socialize with people. When a band is playing loud and aggressive music you don't really have to talk with anyone. Third, he gets extremely stoned on marijuana and drinks when he goes to these things. I think it gives him reason to indulge even further than he already does. Coupled with the loud stimulating environment he escapes even further.\n\nWould be interested in others thoughts or if these have ever seen similar behavior with an introverted narcissist.\n\nEDIT:Forgot to mention that a majority of the concerts he goes to are for death metal or other really negative metal concerts.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

And more importantly, why do keep being attracted to them?", "author": "ExplainTheWorld", "self_text": "Since the beginning of my dating life, I have mostly been dating guys who are superficially charming and shower me with attention at first, and once I begin a sexual relationship with them, become distant. To be fair, most of the time they warn me (more or less) about not wanting a relationship but still send mixed signals. At first, I thought that this was normal behaviour and they simply lost interest in me as a partner...normal dating, you know? But by now, it has become such a pattern that I can predict the exact course of almost every \"relationship\" I have: Attention --&gt; Distance --&gt; Increased Attention --&gt; Complete Cut-off. I have recently met a guy who is beyond charming, smart and in many aspects exactly the kind of guy I have always dreamed of. He has been telling me from the very beginning that he is not looking for a serious relationship but still continued going out with me DESPITE me telling him that I am more interested in something serious. Yesterday, he was at my place and it was really weird. He was opening up to me to some extent but still keeping his distance by being irritated by me wanting to cuddle after sex, complimenting and at the same time picking on me subtly. He did seem concern about our different expectations and in fact, seemed a little concerned about hurting me (looking back, it could have just as well been that he is more worried about it being stressful for him than me being hurt). Nevertheless, I still had the impression that the liked the fact that I was a bit more clingy than him and enjoyed the tension it created.  \n\nIronically, at the moment my subject at University is Personality Disorders and because of that, I came to the conclusion that the majority of men I have dated display narcissistic behaviour. Until now, I refused to call them Narcissists believing that it is term that is used way too much but the commonalities are becoming more obvious every time. I still have my doubts because is it really possible to almost only date Narcissists? Is it something about me as a person that attracts them? However, what really concerns me is that I seem to attract people with narcissistic traits almost exclusively while other people are frequently far less interested in me. \n\nWhat is even worse is the fact that I seem to be attracted to them rather than just attracting them. To some extent, I kind of enjoy these games for power and manipulations. How can I stop attracting these people and how do I develop a healthier identity that is not so strongly drawn to them? And how do end things with the guy I am \"dating\". It is harder for me this time compared to the guys before him because I really really like him.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Who I talk to, what I share, what I should share, something as simple as 'where did I eat today, where did I go for a walk?' are all too intimate for me to share now after having my trust betrayed. I'm living with my ex fiance after a volatile unveil this summer. There was a miscarriage, sexual abuse, my attempt to opt out, getting pushed to the point of collapsing to keep up with him in an activity he enjoys, medical concerns like the possibility of cancer and so much else. \n\nHe told me things like 'you're gaslighting me, you're toxic, you overreact, you are hostile' and that he's a 'laid back, easy going person', 'compassionate', and I'm 'abrasive'. He withheld affections for several months, wanting no contact with me, not even a phone call or text, because he was 'too busy' yet in reality he was too busy with an intern at the office occupying his attention. They were texting and talking all day, it's just weird that she uses a different number to text him than she uses with anyone else they work with. I used to care. I've stopped caring.\n\nWhat is making me struggle now is I live in a city where I relocated to that is a collective hive of people he knows, but I don't know anyone outside his circle of influence. I've been a domestic trapped house partner for several years. He brought me up here with the lure of going back to college, getting a part time job and a car for me to use. Lots of empty promises. He was always too busy to do things with me once I moved up. Never too busy for this new supply though -- she's welcome to him, they're both idiots that can't seem to use common sense and then he tells me about all the ways he's hurt himself. It's always about him and how he feels.\n\nHe only recently started asking me how my day is going, what have I been up to, and I just stick to simple answers of 'It's another day' or 'It's been a long day'. We'll eat dinner together while he texts her or occupies himself, but I know when he starts showing me more concern, it's because he's up to something. In the last week he's been touching me, soft gentle brushes against my arms, stroking my hair, offering me hugs when he finds me crying in another room. He started offering to cuddle me in the bed he makes me sleep in alone. We napped. It was good, a touch of nostalgia even though I know it'll never be what it was. \n\nLater on though, when we're trying to watch a show together he'll come over to me and the touching becomes more specific. Part of the things he used to break me down this summer was saying I got in the way of his faith, premarital sin, etc. Now he tells me he has all this pent up energy and no outlet, that it's a struggle for him... always about him. I told him we're both suffering, but he was supposed to be on the right path again, and I wasn't going to be the reason he walked off it. So I keep denying him and he keeps trying to engage me in sex. I remind him this was his choice. He made the call not to work things out with me due to X, Y, Z reasons that he felt I was 'toxic and abusive', 'too old', and 'not religious enough'. He says he doesn't have any feelings for me, but continues to try and sate his lust by trying to grind against me, kiss me, touch me, everything else he 'misses', but doesn't necessarily miss doing with me.\n\nEveryone is like 'you need to move out' except my family has shunned me because the evil part of this is that my ex fiance knew about my prior relationship which was over a decade where I eventually got pigeon holed into much the same state: gave up job, gave up place to live, gave up freedom, became domestic, lost independence, etc. So having this all happen again, pushed me off the edge. My family doesn't want anything to do with me. I don't have friends here. I have no job or car. He lets me borrow the car when it suits him, like it's a favor to me, and I profess being grateful for it. He controls the finances, my phone, everything -- what little control I have is the internet and storage unit are in my name. The storage unit contents are super important to him. But because he controls everything, I just lay there and let him paw me, still denying him sex, because he's already shown me when he gets mad (which I used to ask him about because he never once in four years would lose his temper about anything, I said it wasn't realistic) he'll take almost all the money from the joint account and leave me to suffer while he's gone.\n\nWhen he's trying to do things to me, if I protest, he puts his face in mine and says very seriously: \"Be good.\" If I try to shove him off, he does it again and says: \"Be GOOD.\" If I do anything that offends him, he says things like that or \"Be NICE.\" If I mirror him, he'll call me mean, to which I say I'm just mirroring him, so how am I mean? He'll come up with some stupid logic and I'll counter that he's projecting things on me that I don't have to be responsible for, then he'll look at me a bit before trying to change topics.\n\nI've been on several interviews with no luck yet, I've tried studying material to learn new skills and my mind just can't cope. His family doesn't care what he's done or is doing to me, they just want me gone. He's got tons of friends that don't believe anything I've describe can possibly be something he's doing or has done.\n\nHolidays are coming up and I am spiraling.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Here's what's been going on since the break up:\n\n**Day 1 (right after I told her I was ending things):** Emotions were everywhere from her, which of course I suspected, but it was a lot of begging  for another chance, admitting she made a lot of mistakes, admitting she wants to love me the way I feel I deserved to be loved, telling me she is going to change, telling me she will start being honest, telling me she will start respecting me...none of which I gave into and I held my ground. I was hurting because I do have empathy and it still was difficult to feel like I was causing her pain.\n\n**Day 2:** She spent the night with her family (where she will be moving back to) but asked if she could come back to the apartment to start packing things up. I agreed and left for a few hours while she started to box things up. Once she said she was leaving, I went back but found her still in the apartment. I know she stayed until I got back so she could talk to me again. She began crying and saying how her whole life was being ripped away from her and how she will never love again. She started to lose control again and curled up into a ball on the floor. I tried to help (again, my darn empathy kicked in) by telling her I didn't hate her and was just doing what I felt was best for me. I told her my heart has been damaged enough and I don't have anything left to give her. Again, she begged and begged for another chance until finally leaving 2 hours later.\n\n**Day 3 - 5:** She has spent each day (while I'm at work) at our apartment packing her stuff up. During this time she keeps sending me pictures and telling me she is really struggling. I try to ignore it as much as possible. She will also text me \"I love you\" every night before she goes to bed. However, if I don't respond she will get angry and say \"you never cared about me.\" and \"It's so hurtful how easy this is for you. Why don't you care about my feelings?\" etc. Everything and anything to draw a reaction out of me.\n\n**Day 6 (yesterday):** I called because she has been dragging her feet and I want her out so I asked when she would be moving her furniture and she told me her parents are bringing a truck on Saturday. I tried to end the conversation there but she started to get emotional and lose control again over the phone (hyperventilating and saying she had nothing to live for). I finally got a little frustrated at all her attempts to make me feel like a terrible person for ending things and I said something like: \"I can't trust you because you've lied to on several occasions. I know you don't respect me because you crossed my boundaries consistently. When I needed you the most (difficult family situation), you were not there to emotionally support me. I know this sucks and I know you're hurting but you have to at least have the ability to see why I am leaving, right?\" Her response: ***\"To be honest, I never thought you'd ACTUALLY break up with me.\"***\n\nShe says she's hurting because I ended the relationship, but she's not.

Final edit)", "author": "Whalers7997", "self_text": "So, the narcissistic behavior didn't come out until month 4 of our relationship. Before, everything was fine, however I felt something was off. I'm more of a affectionate person, but with a twisted sense of humor.\n\nShe, my Narc-Ex was a little cold when it came to affection. I always felt like I had one foot in and one foot out. Except when I was around the dogs or horses. She also had a bad view of sex from what she claimed was a bad experience with an ex.\n\n\n\nIt started after we got back from a vacation that included staying at a place with my family. She came over one weekend, and was a little cold. Over wine, she said she thought she couldn't be with just one person. That she wasn't the type to be monogamous and that staying with one person with no exit was burdensome. She later apologized and said she had some doubts that she wanted to express.\n\nNow during this time, we also didn't have sex. Even before I was diagnosed with a hernia, we didn't do it. I thought it was just because she was busy taking 3 online grad courses. I should have known better. She even said that after I was diagnosed that \"I don't want to do anything for fear I may hurt you, hindering your healing.\"\n\nNow, another red flag popped up when she talked about her past sex life. Before me she was a guy who was between gender reassignments, another guy who worked the night shift at BJ's who believed he had demon wives, and lived in a house before moving back with her home where she was a sex slave. In hindsight, this should have been several red flags. She also would talk about past sexual experiences, which would eat at me because of the lack of sex. I guess Narcissists have a way of finding the weak spot.\n\nDuring September is when it all went crazy. After I had my surgery, she started acting strange. She first cut me off and gave me the silent treatment. Then after trying to reach her several times, told me to chill and that I needed space with my friends. What friends? She never told me she had any real friends. She had acquaintances she knew through the barn and around town.\n\nSo I gave her the space and a week later, we met up at a diner where she unloaded on me that that my family had no boundaries and that I can't do a relationship right now because of work and the injuries from riding. She didn't even want people at her house. I couldn't even see the pups. I storm out of the diner where I later get a barrage of texts and phone calls, telling me \"to come back and that if you stayed I would discussed the situation further. That if you understood what I was trying to say.\"\n\nSo I gave her the silent treatment. The texts came. Then she called one me day saying that she was sorry and that she was just confused and had doubts. I think this is called \"trauma bonding\".\n\nAfter a bit, we get back together. I meet up with her over the weekend, it goes well. Then Monday comes where we have a discussion. After she said that her one horse couldn't be ridden anymore, she says we can't be together because of the lack of sex. Hello, it was your idea to put it off and I was one week away from getting cleared. I block her.\n\nI decided to unblock after a week after my friends and family told me not to and I get tempted again. This time, with my head straightened out from friends and family, I break up with her. I get sent texts about us and she sends me back all the things I got her with a letter, expressing that I had some agenda and these gifts were not out of love.\n\nThe last thing she texted me was that \"I hope your dick works for new girlfriend.\"\n\nWhile we were going back and forth she said that \"she was perfect.\"", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When we first started dating he was so loving and caring towards me. I really thought he was the one. I moved in with him after only a few months of dating because he insisted that was the natural step and got angry when I thought it was too soon. I moved in and things in our relationship started changing. First it was the chores. When I moved in he insisted on himself paying the mortgage of the house and that I would pay all the bills. I said fine, but then he started holding it over my head all the time, saying I should do more since he pays the big bill. He insisted that I do more of the chores even though we both work 40 hours a week. Then when I started doing the chores he requested, he always nitpicked me and complained about how I was doing them. Everything I did was wrong and I never did them enough. Sometimes he'd even stomp around and redo certain things that he thought I did \"incorrectly.\" It's so tiring. We are two people, so it's not like we make a huge mess, buy anytime I don't immediately clean he gets mad and calls me lazy and selfish and tells me to do more. \n\nWe also have problems with sex. When we first dates he was very loving and passionate. However when I moved in he started acting like it was owed to him. I was no longer allowed to say no. If I turned him down, he would respond by snatching covers off me, turning on lights or making loud noises while I was trying to sleep. Therefore I stopped saying no to sex. Now he has an issue because I don't give him blow jobs. Says I should be doing more sexual things with him everyday and then maybe I wouldn't have to worry about chores. He says that I wouldn't have to worry about chores if I just made him sexually happy.\n\nThis is where I think I may be the problem. With all of the criticisms and patronizing, I found myself pulling back and not trying anymore. I don't pretend to enjoy sex and I clean with no gusto. I just feel like there is no point in trying because he will criticize and complain no matter what. Clearly this doesn't help and I do feel very guilty that I don't give him enjoyable sex or do my chores perfectly. I'm just so tired all the time because it honestly is never enough to make him happy. So now when he yells at me I know I deserve it because I'm not doing the things I'm supposed to do. Sometimes I can't help but think if I tried more he'd be happy, but then i remember how it used to be in the beginning and know that even when I tried my hardest it was never enough for him.\n\nI dunno. I am stressed and tired all the time and have him holding things over my head all the time. Says since I live in his house I should be doing more to make him happy. I am just so lost and confused and wondering if I am causing this. Could he really be happy and treat me better if I just gave him what he wanted?\n\nI plan on leaving him soon but I can't help but feel so guilty and I'm not sure why.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Yet im still here. \n\nI was so unbelievably pressured to be something i wasnt. i was to accept things i didnt want. To allow things i was entirely against. \n\nI was held responsible for his shittyness. i \"wasnt to be trusted\" And my character was and is consistantly spotlighted. I was and am judged for just being me. Theres something wrong with me. Thats how he sees it. \n\nI have gone through the worst of my days with SO. It was very emotionally and mentally abusive, as well as physically abusive. He either denied the encounter, or he blamed me. If it wasnt for something i did, it wouldnt have happened. Or he wouldnt have felt whatever way and said whatever he said. \n\nFinally this man child has grown some, not more caring. But he changed in taking more responsibility in adult ways. Like actually taking care of our kids. Actually trying to be a part. Pushing me away. Ive always had taken accountability, then out of the blue he was up, taking charge in the mornings, telling me to step away. \n\nI have not received an apology, i have not gotten the recognition that i deserve.  But now, he is turning the tables. He is trying to convince *me* of being the abuser. *I* am the controlling one. I am appalled. \n\nI completely let myself go. I have gained over 100 pounds in the last 2 years. I remember stuffing my face anytime i was being accused of something, of acting a \"suspicious\" way.. when i wanted to defend myself, or cry.. i just ate. I kept food in my mouth till the emotion passed. Till the urge to fight back passed. \n\nI stopped fighting, I kneeled. So instead of standing against me,  he is now standing over me, feeling accomplished. Waving at our on lookers as if he defeated \"the beast\" I am fucking broken. \n\nI use to fight back, i use to feel like i could leave, and did leave 3 times, until the last time, i bowed, i bowed and said Babe, youre struggling with something, and i want to help you. And i was willing to stand by and wait for him to change. Wait for him to grow up. Wait for him to see that i was faithful, loyal and worthy. \n\nBut when i went silent, he panicked. He asked me why i was letting go, why i wouldnt fight anymore and that it must be because i was *CHEATING*. This time i allowed him to believe whatever he wanted, i just wouldnt fight anymore. \n\n***So he left me.*** Took my son, and since he is tribal, the courts sided with him.  He later begged me back, and now he holds me accountable for breaking *his* heart. During my time of fighting back, he said he felt that i am controlling, mean and manipulative. And that i need to respect him, embrace him and appreciate him. When i still have not gotten my apology. I have not gotten the acknowledgement, in fact i am still blamed for the pain i felt, yet he is holding me accountable?! \n\nIn this depression, i have let myself go. Gained weight, my body hurts. He has laughed and asked me, \"ready for diabetes?\" He wishes pain on me. He has told my son he doesnt need his mommy, he is still a toddler. He is manipulating my older kids (not his kids) Telling them that i am unstable. \n\nAnd i still cant find the courage to just fucking move on with my life.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This is how I dealt with facing my past.)\n\nTHE MASK\n\nIt\u2019s intoxicating in the beginning; to see behind the mask they wear in public. The one that the World sees. A persona that draws you in, makes you trust, makes you care, makes you love. And you do.  It feels so deeply personal, like you\u2019re connected on a baser level. \n\r\nIt becomes an obsession, to see the most inner workings of their mind. A craving like no other. It feels like it means something more,  because it\u2019s something they only show you. It\u2019s safe, in the beginning. You laugh, you smile, you trust, you love \u2013 and all the time the darkness seeps in, without you noticing it at first. Those dark places have been hidden for a reason, and that path quickly becomes a dark one. \n\r\nA smile becomes a frown as you try to understand what you did to make them angry. A laugh becomes a cry as you obsessively replay the last hour and try to figure out where you went wrong. Trust becomes reliance, you\u2019ve come so far, you\u2019ve connected on a deeper level. You must keep going. They are you\u2019re reason for being; you just need to work out where you\u2019re going wrong and it\u2019ll all be fine again. Love becomes fear, and suddenly your World is closing in on its self. Every decision becomes a life changing one, because you don\u2019t want to get it wrong. \n\r\nOne by one your connections to the outside fade, as you justify not being able to see old friends and family, not being able to go out, or not being able to go alone. You need them with you. At least that\u2019s what you tell yourself, and it seems perfectly normal that way. They belong by your side after all. As every door closes around you, you tell yourself that the World just doesn\u2019t understand your connection. \n\r\nIt hurts. In the beginning it\u2019s little things. Pangs of paranoia, of jealousy, of worry. Never justified, never explained, and never soothed. Instead it is nurtured, and encouraged to grow. The hurt unquantifiable, the chasm inside you unmeasurable. But you persist. This is what love is supposed to be. It must be, because it\u2019s never felt like the others. It\u2019s deeper somehow.\r\nIt chips away at your very soul. You wonder who the person in the mirror is now. You wonder what you could have done to make them treat you better. You nurse your heart, you wipe your tears, and you move on to another day. Another day just like the one before. Another day of pain, of hurt, of grief. You mourn the loss of the relationship you once had, even though you are still in it \u2013 and you try to work out what you can do to fix the pieces broken beyond repair. \n\r\nWhen they tell you you\u2019re just paranoid, you believe them. When they tell it\u2019s your fault, you believe them. When they tell you that you did this to them, you believe them. Because what else is there but loneliness and emptiness. You\u2019ve built your existence around them; and that\u2019s just the way they wanted it to be. \n\r\nWhen you shake uncontrollably from fear, when you have to step in front of them to stop them hurting your beloved pet, when you cry your heart out over your latest argument, and try to soothe your burning throat and never-ending tears; when you wonder when they will finally turn on you and tear you limb from limb\u2026 you ponder. Ponder how to change them. Ponder how to make things right. Ponder how you can better so they will love you again. They say they do, but their actions seem less and less by the day to suggest they do, so it must be you that\u2019s the cause of this chasm that\u2019s opening up every day. \n\r\nWhen they are finally gone, the grief is unbearable. You can\u2019t understand, can\u2019t comprehend. You are torn between questioning every step you took, every decision you made, and every moment you shared to see how you could have been better; and loss of something you still hold so incredibly dear to your heart that it hurts to think about them. \n\r\nBut then the clouds begin to lift. The sun begins to rise, and the World starts to feel brighter again. Piece by piece you start to think about the bigger picture, and it rips you to shreds anew when you finally realise that it was all a lie. That you were a pawn in a never ending game of cat and mouse, and you weren\u2019t the cat. That you had little or no control, and that it wasn\u2019t you who was truly wrong. \n\r\nLittle by little, the darkness recedes, but those pieces have to be broken time and time again before they will mend. They do, and you try to move on; but the darkness you once saw stays with you. You trust less, you love more cautiously, your smile hides the fact that you\u2019re afraid to feel again. To let someone in. \n\r\nAnd still their mask remains. You try to speak, but the World won\u2019t listen. You try to shout, but the World hears nothing. You cry tears of anger and frustration, of loss and of grief, but the World says nothing. And when you mention their name, the World smiles, and they tell you how wonderfully kind and caring they are, and you balk. Understanding creeps in. The World isn\u2019t ready to see what you saw. The World isn\u2019t ready to hear your truth.\n\r\nThe World isn\u2019t ready to comprehend the scale of the manipulation. The World isn\u2019t ready to understand the level of fear that was a constant companion in those months and years of constant control. The World isn\u2019t ready to face the darkness that can\u2019t be seen within them from the surface. And once again you\u2019re told that it\u2019s you who is wrong, you who is unkind and uncaring. The World turns its back, and continues to see what it wants to see. \n\r\nYou learn to move forward, somehow. You have friends, and family, who rally round. They don\u2019t know the whole truth, but they believe in you when you tell them how hurt you have been. They listen, they comfort, they offer a friendly smile to brighten your day. \n\r\nQuestions become answers, and answers become strength. You start to realise that the mask you saw behind wasn\u2019t what you thought it was. It hid something from the World, but what was hidden was darker than you could have known. With hindsight comes understanding, and you start work on rebuilding your story together; this time with the truth instead of their lies. \n\r\nEverything becomes clear. You a renewed with a sense of clarity that didn\u2019t exist before, and finally you can breathe again. \r\nAnd still the World sees the mask. But you let them see what they want to see, as you learn to live again.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I ended up cutting contact with him a bit over 5 years ago (5 years in August). He mostly psychologically abused me as well as gaslit me and some physical abuse, including probably breaking my nose once, but mostly leaving bruises on my arms as well as physically holding me after a verbal fight in which he would not relent on his being correct, and I would eventually give up because I was sick of fighting and just wanted to go home. He would then hold me and ask if it was so hard to just admit I was wrong. He called these \"hugs.\" \n\nI found out a year or two after going no contact that he had gotten engaged, and I sent a message to one of her (his fianc\u00e9e's) friends that seemed cautious about that relationship moving too quickly.

It was a fun time. The next week, my coworker asked me if we could all drop by again on our way home.  (I was headed to ND\u2019s place and my coworker and him are friends and live near each other.)

The more apparent it was that he had a girlfriend, the harder the woman would pursue him. It became a game for both of them. \n\nI am still really on guard and paranoid of all women and I hate it.

When I was around 5, my 19 year old brother came into my room one day and said let\u2019s play a game. He had me straddle him while I was wearing a dress and I know it sounds bizarre but he had me bounce up and down. I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it and asked if I could go back to playing with my toys and he said no just a little longer and kept saying stuff about how good I was doing until finally he let me go back to playing on my own. Looking back I know I was sitting where his dick would be because I specifically remember looking down because I was too shy to look him in the eyes, and I could see his belly button because his shirt was pulled up a bit. So I think he basically had me simulating sex on him. I feel like this was wrong and gross, but when I think of all the people who have actually been molested or raped, I feel like I don\u2019t deserve to call my experience anything but just weird... any thoughts or opinions on this???

To make this easier well call her, Callie (fake name). we met a teen support group and we opened up a little about our experiences with sexual assault. I was drugged and assaulted by a guy I had been seeing. Callie was assaulted by a guy, (well call him Jake), at a party and she later dated him for a month.\nCallie and I started as friends and then confessed our feeling for each other. We continued to see each other till the group was over, and on the last day of group she asked me to be her girlfriend and I said yes. I hadn\u2019t been in a relationship in over a year because I was waiting for someone I really connected with. I felt that connection with her and everything was going really well. \n\nThis afternoon, I asked Callie if she was busy and if she wanted to come over. Callie said wasn\u2019t busy and asked what time. I told Callie she could come over whenever. We sent a couple snapchats back and forth and then she stopped opening them. After an hour, I looked on snap maps and Callie was downtown and had just been on Snapchat. I thought \u201cNBD I don\u2019t open her snaps immediately\u201d. I checked back in 30 minutes, because it\u2019s was getting dark. Callie was still downtown and had just been on Snapchat. I started getting paranoid, my ex boyfriend would do this when he cheated. Something felt off, but I tried not to read to much into it. Callie eventually texted me another 30 minutes later, saying she was on her way. I looked at snap maps and she was near where Jake lives.\n\nWhen Callie arrived at my house something still felt off and she didn\u2019t seem as happy to see me. I read the mood, and didn\u2019t kiss her when she came in.  We were sitting in my room and I asked how her night was and she said it was good and said she hung out with her friend, k . (Note: I didn\u2019t ask who she hung out with she told me unprovoked). We were talking about our week and she said that Jake texted her. I said I didn\u2019t want to intrude, but if she wanted to talk about it I\u2019m all ears. Callie said Jake texted that he missed her and she said she missed him to but couldn\u2019t be with him anymore. Callie said it brought up old feelings and then apologized to me. I said she doesn\u2019t need apologize for her feelings. I told her, to be careful and that it\u2019s probably not a good idea to see him, because it can be re-traumatizing when you haven\u2019t seen your attacker in a while. She look at me and kinda smiled and said she already saw him \u201cthis week\u201d. I asked if that\u2019s what she was doing tonight before she came over and she said yes... \n\nWe agreed it was best to break up. I told Callie, that I didn\u2019t want her to obligated to me romantically and that I\u2019m fine being friends because that\u2019s how it started. Callie said she needed to sort her thoughts, but still wanted to be at my house. \n\nSo we were hanging out and joking around. I could tell Callie kept texting back and forth with Jake. She would say something really superficial like \u201coh this group chat is so annoying\u201d \u201cwhy is blah blah blah hitting me up\u201d \u201coh look at this *shows me something on someone\u2019s story*\u201d and then pulls her phone back and turns it away fro me and types away. I wasn\u2019t looking at her screen, just her behavior. The thing she said that really just hit me hard was, \u201cJake texted me about how when I broke up with him I said that if things were meant to be we\u2019d reconnect and he just brought it up and it was sweet\u201d and made some comment along the lines of them being soulmates. \n\nCallie left and I had time to formulate a text. I said,\n \u201cyou\u2019re right, I actually am really hurt. I\u2019m not hurt that you\u2019re having feelings or that the relationship ended. I\u2019m hurt you felt the need to lie unprovoked. I\u2019m hurt that you came over and talked about how you and Jake are soulmates and whatever sweet shit he said. You didn\u2019t have to show me stuff on your phone then turn it away to text him. I don\u2019t like being lied to or feeling like someone is trying to deceive me. I don\u2019t want to make you choose. But If you\u2019re involved with him, I can\u2019t be here for you. It\u2019s harmful to my recovery and as much as I care about you, I can\u2019t support you though going back to him. I\u2019d support you if you wanted to be with someone else who wasn\u2019t me, but not Jake. So sit on it and talk to your therapist\u201d\n\nCallie was saying she didn\u2019t know what to do. I just felt awful because,\n why is it so hard to choose between me and her rapist? I know it not as simple as that and I shouldn\u2019t internalize it, but it makes me feel really bad about myself. I told her, she needs to do what\u2019s best for her and I can\u2019t make a decision for her. Then she said she was done and wouldn\u2019t cut him off and all I replied with was \u201cokay\u201d.\n\nI romanticizes my rapist for a few months after because he gaslighted me next super hard. I can\u2019t risky myself recovery to help her. I cried for an hour because, the situation reminded me of my rapist and everything that happened. I don\u2019t believe her when she says she\u2019ll cut him off. I don\u2019t think I could ever trust her if she wanted to get back together, because I wouldn\u2019t be able to trust anything she says. She reaffirmed all my insecurities.

He dumped me out of nowhere, cried hysterically while doing it, and then later that night went to a party and chugged a bottle of vodka (I saw this happen through someone's snapchat). Ever since then, I have not heard from him. I have initiated NC since the day we broke up, however, I had to sometimes give in because I mailed his stuff back and his friend died so I had to be a decent person and share my condolences. Other than that, I do not take part in ANYTHING he posts on social media. I do not watch any stories nor do I watch any of his friends' stories. He still watches all of my stories and is always one of the first to do so. Because I have him muted on snapchat and instagram, I can still see that he posts things, which he seems to do a LOT now. He used to tell me how much he hated social media and how he would only post for special things, but I can tell now that he is posting something nearly every day. I really think it's to get my attention, which is something he has done in the past. I'm still not watching. \n\nAnyway, one of my closest friends (22F) told me last night that my nex texted her a few weeks ago asking about me. He also texted her late at night, and she said that she would've told me about this sooner, but she was so tired and slept which made her forget about it completely. She told him that I am of course upset with him for breaking up with me, but I am still out there living my life, going to school, and excelling at my job, \"doing my thing.\" She told him that if he wants to know how I am doing, then he should reach out to me. He then gave her a super narcissistic response and said, \"Well, if she needs something she can reach out to me.\" After that, my friend didn't reply. I asked her if she asked how he was doing and she said no, which is probably something that pissed him off. \n\nThe reason why this makes me feel better is that it reinforced how much of an ass my nex is. Why in the world would I NEED him right now??? Is he serious? He let me go, and I have been living an independent life for almost three months now. I have no reason to need him (besides the fact that he still has my things but I still won't reach out to him about that). I also am so grateful for my friend who basically stuck it up to him and told him that I am still living my life without him. It's probably killing him inside. \n\nI'm really grateful that he did this because now I know that my friends DO have my back. \n\nAlso, my nex is a moron, which is very comforting to remember.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It got to the point where I wasn't allowed to talk to him about any of those things and it just became easier to cut them out of my life then have to deal with the stress with work, friends, and family and now the stress of dealing with him surrounding these issues. I always felt that friends and family were people you loved and who loved you and you could be yourself with. If you had a crappy day you might snap at them but it was ok, they knew you best, loved you most, and were there to help you through whatever might be going on. For over 5 years I was conditioned to believe that simply wasn't the case. That I needed to compartmentalize my life and not let anything bleed into each other. If I was stressed or upset about something, I needed to figure it out on my own and continue to go through life as if nothing was different. \n\nYou know what? That's not possible. I wouldn't say anything, I'd pretend everything was ok, I'd try to solve the issues on my own, but I'm human, and I have emotions, and I can't keep everything bottled in. So, even though I was trying to do everything he asked me to do, it was if he had set an impossible expectation that I would never be able to live up to, no matter what I did, and then it would become another thing that I needed to work on. Another thing to prove to him that I wasn't committed to the relationship or making things better. Another thing that I had failed with.\n\nFast Forward to Today: Things have been stressful - dealing with lawyers re separation agreement, work climate is not good, having to deal with lawyers at work as well (general lawsuit against my place of work but had to spend all day yesterday providing discovery evidence for the suit from the last 6 years -- stressful), recovering from surgery so I'm good enough to be back at work but easily exhausted and sore. Take all these things and I didn't feel myself, I was off. I could tell I was easily irritated by people, snippy with them, just generally not my usual, happy self. I sent out a quick apology to my group of friends at work re this and a friend replied that just broke me. She responded saying that I didn't need to apologize, that's what friends are for, to be yourself and for them to support me with whatever I was going through.\n\nI immediately burst into tears. Still am crying when I think about it. For 5 long years I was alone and made to feel like relying on someone else to understand me was wrong. In one simple text some huge wounds have started to heal. I realized how deeply I've been traumatized and wounded by this relationship. How the simplest things can trigger me. I'm finding more and more that my triggers aren't things that bring me to panic or anger anymore, but things I'm realizing I was right all along about but ignored and ultimately changed who I fundamentally was. \n\nSo, to all my friends who are healing, I wish you all the best. It is a hard, long journey but one that brings us to a better place and a better self. Things get easier, those wounds do heal but you just need to give yourself the time that you need.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I still think he is a great guy, I just hope he sort his sh\\*t out and hopefully one day he'll get the help he needs.\n\nA little background info: Broke up with my boyfriend last week for various reasons, but the main reason was because of our toxic communication and constant fights and frustrations. Discovered he has some narcissistic traits after the breakup, although he is a lot milder than my dad. It kind of made sense I would be attracted to his type, but I'm determined to break the cycle.\n\nI had blocked his numer and ( later, since it wasn't a problem at first) all of his social media accounts, but he'd call with an unknown number various amount of times. He somehow found my email address a few days later and send me a heartbreaking letter, which made it really hard for me not to reply. Despite that, I remained rational and reminded myself why it was so important not to contact him back (though I'm aware I still love and care about him).\n\nSince he contacts me with an unknown/anonymous number, I can't block him on my phone. I'm used to having a lot of missed calls from his unknown number this past week, but it's never been this bad. He has been calling all day and he has literally called over eighty times.\n\nShould I call or text back? Give him closure? I know it's driving him crazy because he's lost something real, so should I give him closure? It's hard to heal by myself when he's constantly trying to contact me, since it's only been ten days.

I have a question on your healing and if you have also had this experience. I really appreciate this forum and you have helped me a lot with your contributions.\n\nMy NEX (f, 23) and I (m, 27) separated and came back together after she didn't even manage to keep no contact for 2 days (I didn't know about narcissism then). The time after that, with the exception of the first week, was worse than anything before. No efforts on her part, practically no tenderness or closeness. I was irritated, she was the one who wanted to try again... We broke up again and after another month I had to break off contact and block her everywhere. The hot and cold game and further devaluations became more and more extreme and I was close to losing my mind. Since then I have learned a lot about narcissism and have improved in all areas of my life. I'm fitter than before the relationship and at work and at university it's going well. I'm seeing a therapist and read a lot on healing from abuse.\n\nI haven't heard from her, we don't have any mutual friends. Only one of her friends wrote to me twice for ridiculous reasons (I don't know her well and she didn't actually have my mobile phone number before...). The second time I also blocked her.\n\nMy ex and I happened to see each other again when I was on my way to university with a friend. She didn't even look at me, but she kindly said hello to my friend. She looked very tired and unhappy, her friendly mask couldn't hide it. This encounter did me little harm. This was two months ago.\n\nBut this week I saw her from afar with her female roommate. It was like a shock, all the energy I had accumulated was out of me within a second. My NEX seemed so familiar to me. For a few days now I have had an inner desire to talk to her, to hold her, to be with her as in our good times.  I surely can resist that, bu I feel very sad. I've never looked at her social media profiles in 3 months and I'm fine with being alone in general. It's just like a drug addiction that I must withstand. She may also be worse off than I am. After her last separation with her ex (of whom she never told anything good) she quit her job and became depressed, had to go to the therapist and got medication which she still takes today. Only when she met me did she feel better again, she told me once.\n\nI know there is no easy and quick solution.

I am so angry I don't know what to do.", "author": "MyAllegoricalElegy", "self_text": " \n\nThis is my second post here.  The first one was just a few days after the breakup.\n\nI  could write a lot about why I chose to get out.  But I will give a  brief list of reasons.  He bragged about his past promiscuity and didn't  even know how many women he'd been with.  But wouldn't have sex with me  to save his life.  He didn't even want to touch, kiss or show any  affection at all for the last year or so we were together.   We probably  only had sex maybe 8 times the entire time we were together.  And while  not having sex with me, he would talk openly about other women he knew  who he thought were hot and wanted to sleep with.  (While claiming not  having any sex drive.)  And he had a whole entourage of adoring female  fans, most of whom he slept with at some point.  Who he was always  talking to online, texting and hanging out with.  I'm not a jealous  person.  Everyone has a past, but it got old after a while.\n\nAlso,  nothing, and I mean NOTHING was good enough for him.  No matter what I  did to make him happy, he was never satisfied.  He was always  complaining about how I didn't show him any appreciation.  So I would go  out of my way and do whatever I could think of to show him  appreciation, and he still complained about how unappreciated he felt.\n\nIf  I talked about something he wasn't interested in he would cut me off,  saying he didn't care/ didn't want to hear it.  But I would have to  listen to him drone on and on about things I don't care about.\n\nIf  I ever asked him for help with anything, even if it was something as  simple as carrying bags in from the car.  I was usually told no.  Not  always, but about 90% of the time.  But if he asked for my help, if I  dared say no, it was world war 3.  When he needed help, the only  acceptable answer was yes.  And the only acceptable time was right now.   Or else he threw a fit.  And he also claimed that I \"Never helped him  with anything.\"\n\nIf I ever messed  up, NO explanation and NO apology were ever good enough for him.  But  when anyone else messed up they were given infinite grace, forgiveness,  and benefit of the doubt.  Perfect example.  One of his employees was  violent with me at one point.  She wasn't reprimanded by him.  She kept  her job.  She was even rewarded by him that night for the great job she  had done working for him that weekend.  He didn't see it was a problem  that she basically assaulted me because in his words \"You weren't  seriously injured.\"  And he also said, \"She didn't really think before  she did it.\"  Oh so that makes it ok.  I'm not seriously injured and she  didn't think about it first.\n\nThis  the just the simplest list of reasons why I chose to end things.  I was  sick of trying to please an unpleasable person and sick of everything  being my fault.\n\nBut coping with  all this anger I feel is getting difficult.  I don't know if I have ever  been this pissed off in my life at anyone.  The only time I ever felt  anything close to this level of anger was when I found out my ex-husband  was cheating on me.  And I think this trumps that.  When I confronted  my ex-husband, he knew he was busted and he owned what he did.  My  recent ex just has excuse after excuse after excuse.  He lied to me,  well it was my fault for asking the question and giving him the  opportunity to lie.  He embarrassed me in public, oh well that was just  my negative perception.  If I wasn't so damn negative all the time we  wouldn't be having this issue, etc.\n\nHe  was also the king of gaslighters.  Once I told him something in  confidence and asked that he not repeat it.  What does he do?  Blurts it  out loudly in a whole room full of my friends at a New Year's Eve  party.  When confronted later, he claimed he never did that and I was  just remembering things wrong.  He also made a big show out of telling  me how wrong I was handling a consignment contract in my company once,  in front of a whole bunch of people.  Even though there are several ways  to handle consignment and the way I was handling it was perfectly legal  and legit.  It wasn't his way, so he went off on me about it.  And then  claimed this never happened.  He tried to accuse me of making stuff up  just to start drama.  He tried to say that because I grew up in a bad  family I was used to drama so if there was no drama I would go out of my  way to create it, etc.  NOT true!\n\nHe  was the one that approached me first.  We are both business owners and  we knew each other through work.  Our businesses are in the same field,  but we aren't competitors, as we don't provide the same services.  In  the beginning, I heard all about how beautiful I am.  How impressed he  is with me as a business person.  How beautiful my energy is.  (He has  this obsession with energy...)  The over the last year... suddenly he  hates the way I run my company.  And he also hates my energy.  Oh, my  energy is draining and repellent and he doesn't even want to be around  me because I exhaust him.  And, of course, he told me in subtle ways how  ugly I am too.  He even asked permission to cuddle with one of his  female friends so he could feel her beautiful energy as a way of  recharging after dealing with my nasty energy.  Then when she said no he  got mad at me for reasons I still don't quite get. I just don't  understand how I went from being such a great person in his eyes to  being so awful.  I didn't change significantly in the time we were  together.  My hair color changed a few times.  But I dye my hair a lot  and also I wear wigs pretty regularly.  He knew that before he ever even  asked me out.  I also gained some weight due to being immobile with a  foot injury for a bit.  But I lost it once my injury was healed and I  could be active again.  I am still trying to wrap my mind around how I  could go from loved to hated in such a short time.\n\nI  am able to look back on past relationships and see my own faults.  I  can see what I did that contributed to their failure.  But with this  one, I honestly can't.  I bent over backward for him.  I did everything I  could to please this man.  This is one case where I can't see anything  all that significant that I did wrong.  And I am more angry with myself  than anyone else.  Because for some reason I am still in love with the  asshole and I miss him. And because of work, I still have to see him on a  regular basis.  This is unavoidable.  Unless I close my business, or  completely relocate my business, I am still going to see him.  And  neither of those are an option.  And everyone we know through work  thinks he is so amazing.  People act like he is just the greatest person  on Earth.  He has all these adoring fans.  I wonder what they are all  going to think of me now?  I will be the evil nasty B---- that broke his  heart.\n\nI am just here for support  and advice on how to deal with all this anger I am feeling.  It has  gotten to the point of making me feel physically ill.  I'm mad at myself  for staying, also.  I don't know if I can ever love anyone again after  this.  And I even told him that.  I am in therapy also, have been for a  while now.  I was in therapy even while in the relationship.\n\nTL;DR   I just got out of a very toxic relationship I was in for 3 years.  I  am really angry at my ex and at myself.  I am also confused about how  someone could go from loving me so much to hating me in such a short  time.

He was great in the beginning and I thought I had finally found the perfect man.  However, a month into the relationship I ended up getting on ovarian cyst.  I have endometriosis so this is nowhere near uncommon but it does come with a lot of difficulties.  For one, I end up in a lot of pain afterward, like in the fetal position for nearly a month and barely able to function from pain.  This also means that sex is extremely painful.  He was great for the first week after the cyst, but quickly got frustrated because he was doing all this stuff for me and I was just laying in bed all day.  As I got better I was able to move around more but I had no interest in sex as I couldn't even put a tampon in without crying.  I tried explaining this to my ex and he didn't believe me.  He would tell me that if I wasn't sleeping with him I was sleeping with someone else, no long attracted to him, the list goes on.  I honestly loved him and I didn't want him to think any of this was true and I finally wore down and agreed to sleep with him.  I asked him to go slow and said that I could only do a couple of positions.  This ended up being awful.  I was immediately in pain and asked him to stop, which he did, but then he yelled at me for not wanting to get him off.  From that point on I just kept my mouth shut since I didn't want to start another fight.  It got to the point that I'd literally have to be sobbing from pain before he'd stop.

I was barely fifteen when I overdosed.  I wasn\u2019t dating my ex/abuser/rapist yet, but we were best friends.  He meant the world to me, and my fifteen year old self fell in love with him.  After taking the pills and waiting for it to kick in, I was reminded of every time he had previously told me not to end it.  I never was one to go and talk about my mental health issues, but he had told me in such a way previously that I felt he was the reason I should live if I didn\u2019t have any other reason.  I tried to call him beforehand to talk so I wouldn\u2019t do something I would regret.  He was at practice and didn\u2019t answer.  In a panicked moment, I took the pills and waited to die.  After several minutes, I thought of him.  I was naive and young, and decided I would call the police because of him.  Long story short, I went to the ER, inpatient, and all that jazz.  Shortly after this incident, we kissed and decided not to date officially due to my instability.  And then came the assaults.  It wasn\u2019t rape yet, but it got close.  Emotionally abusing and manipulating me, but I felt I owed him my life.  I didn\u2019t leave.  Many months later we got together as our parents pushed us together.  We would most likely have gotten together without the push, but it made the abuse more prominent and consistent.  He felt he owned me then.  I felt he did too.  It hasn\u2019t even been a month since I escaped this relationship, but thinking back on the anniversary of my suicide attempt this year, I remember word for word what he told me as we aimlessly drove while I brought up the date.  \n\n\u201cPeople who\u2019ve attempted suicide never deserved to live in the first place\u201d\n\nI teared up, and he realized that hit home for me.

I think I am at a place where I am ready to see someone else and I have been talking to a really nice guy(M29) for about 3 weeks. I told him about Nex and he is being really patient with me and he is really supportive about taking things slow. \n\nNex was my first real somewhat long term relationship. The issues that I am having now is that I feel like (because of my lack of experience in relationships before him) there are so many things that were expected of me with my Nex that they became the \"norm\" for me. With Nex it was pretty much a requirement for me to have a continuous conversation with him via text or facebook message all the time. I was expected to reply promptly and if he knew I was talking to someone else and not replying to him. I would get in trouble. I was discouraged from spending time with friends and family without him. And he didnt do things like that without me either. \n\nSo now with the new guy, I find myself repeating old habits. If he texts me I will immediately stop what I am doing no matter what it is and reply. And because life is happening he doesnt always reply right back. (Usually he is working) and I know that he cant be glued to his phone every second to talk to me, but my ex used silence as a punishment for bad behavior. So when SO doesnt instantly reply or it takes a while, I feel like I'm in trouble. Even though he has done absolutely nothing to hint that he is upset at me at all. \n\nAlso SO encourages me to spend time with my friends and family. He and I havent reached the \"meeting the family\" point yet so he has not joined me yet but he also spends time with friends without me. I am completely fine with this. I know that its healthy and normal to spend time with people other than your So But because Nex required me to \"check in\" every 10-15 mins or I was prioritizing everyone else above him. I find myself doing the same thing to SO. To the point where I feel like I am bugging him. (Again he hasnt said anything about it I just feel like I am) and I also still feel like I am ignoring the people that I am with to talk to SO. Even tho he doesnt press me to talk to him. I dont know how to stop feeling like SO is going to get mad at me. From what I have seen of him so far (and I know it hasnt been long) it already seems like he and Nex are polar opposites. But I keep waiting for my failure, for him to be upset at something i have done. \n\nAnd the worst part is, I feel like I am analyzing everything SO does to make sure I am not getting myself into the same kind of narcissistic crap again. And so far he hasnt done anything. There have been no red flags. But I feel so guilty for putting him through all this crap when he hasnt done anything.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

So apparently, sexual grooming is \" Grooming is the slow, methodical, and intentional process of manipulating a person to a point where they can be victimized\". Now I've had 2 moments of my past that I am extremely ashamed about and to be honest, I don't even know what came over me. I just wanted to write down what happened here and ask if anyone knows what kind of behaviour that was.\n\nThe first was back when I was 18. I worked in a sort of tour guide part type job, and I really wanted to perform well and push up to the lead guide role which meant more pay for me. There was a senior there who was part of management and also a lead guide who told me he could teach me how to be better at what i was doing so I could become a lead guide next time. He was much older than me then, I'm not too sure how old but I would say around late 20s? He was a married man as well. (oh, by the way, pardon me if things are not too detailed, the shame made me surpress the event completely and I only just remembered about it because of the video) Right, so he would ask me to come to his tuition centre for extra lessons on how to present myself better or just getting to know myself better and what are my weaknesses and strengths etc etc. But there are 2 things that I remember doing that I was super uncomfortable with doing. First incident was when he said something along the lines of I didnt love myself and i was not comfortable in my own skin, so we did this \"exercise\" to help me be comfortable. He would blindfold himself, and I was to lie almost naked on him (just my bra and panties), with him being the big spoon. He would just hold me, with his blindfold on. The second incident was when he bought some alcohol for me, like hard liquor in a bottle, but I had not drank before in my life due to family background. So that small hard liquor bottle made me slightly woozy, and he said now that my confidence was higher, we were to go outside and do some activities with me braless. So I would just wear his hoodie, and not have anything underneath. (ok, maybe this isn't a big deal, being braless, but in my country, it is, and at my age, I was most definitely uncomfortable with doing that).\n\nYeah so the thing is, I knew I felt uncomfortable, but why the fk did I go along with it?? Thinking back, I feel like I was possessed. But that isn't fully logical reasoning. So I was wondering if any of you guys know what kind of behaviour this is? And what is it exactly that happened to me?", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

While I'm sobbing and trying to recover from it (or from a fight,etc) He will be gliding around the house,  hqppy as could be and singing!!! Then he'll get upset/bothered/annoyed that I'm not able to snap out of the anxiety as quickly as he snaps out of his rage! When I ask him to plz try to not rage bc it directly affects me,  he says \"I SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO FEEL THINGS!  LET ME FEEL THINGS!\" and then says it should be ok since he feels better instantly after raging.  \nHe will also ignore me crying, Continue to happily sing &amp; will make a point to be super loving and sweet to the cats,  right beside me,  but won't give me a single bit of the affection and says it's silly that I'm \"jealous of cats\".\nDoes yours do any of this?  \n\n\nOkay here's the elaboration... And i mentioned a few other incidents/behaviors in this too.  PLEASE read this if you can. \ud83d\ude25\n\n\n Queue the typical same old shit just another day, y narcissist-acts-like-an-abusive-asshole-and-then-expects-me-to-just-get-over-it but when youre trying to recover from an anxiety attack that he randomly invoked in you because of his rage due to the most Petty things...  its hard to just snap out of it when your heart is still racing,  head still feels light, and there's still a lump in your throat. But that's how it goes.  He gets set off,  I try to QUICKLY intercept and do damage control in any way possible so as to try to avoid the impending blow-up....  (Speak softly and carefully with my word choice, offer gentle support and encouragement and optimism and help to him in whatever way possible) But usually it still happens and then I begin internally panicking because I'm scared and anticipating the horrible things he's going to end up saying to me and more heartache to recover from. \nBut once his rage goes away (it will usually last for like 5 minutes) from the minor slight,  he will literally be gliding around the house singing and seemingly happy as could be. Whether he just lashed out at me,  or whether his rage was directed elsewhere (but obviously still directly affected me).  \nI'll be sitting there feeling so small and so broken,  and he will be singing and having a blast...  He will also make a point to love on the cats and give them attention and affection and say sweet things to them,  meanwhile I'm a few feet away trying to self soothe and get myself calmed down.  He is a cat lover,  to the max.  We both are.  He is always amazing to our cats.  But he knows it really does upset me when he won't even come hug me or say sorry to me and try to help me recover from his fit,  but instead he'll direct that attention and focus to the cats.  And of course if I try to say anything about it I'm met with some kind of \"are you serious!?\" Because it's so ridiculous \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude0f Yes,  perhaps it IS.  And yes I do feel silly to feel jealous of the fact that he treats our cats with so much love and consideration and is ALWAYS gentle with them. Of course I want him to regard them like that...  But it feels like some kind of deliberate cruelty and manipulation to make a point to say and do these things to the cats at that specific moment in time when I, his wife,  is in desperate need for the attention and affection that he is showing to them,  right now,  to help me recover from HIS anxiety inducing behavior. \nWhen I ask him to try to be more mindful of how it affects others (me)  and to work on controlling it,  he gets angry and says \"I SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO FEEL THINGS!  IM ALLOWED TO FEEL!  If I want to be mad I should be able to be!  And then I feel better immediately and I get over it right away!  It never lasts! And then I'm fine again!\"\nAnd then I have to explain to him that YES,  HE is \"better\" after his tantrum, and HE is fine now and back to being happy now, but EVERYONE ELSE is STILL TRYING TO RECOVER. \n\nHe has never hugged me when I'm crying (or actually at any other time either)  Except for twice,  since we got married 5 years ago. \nMy grandfather died last year and he didn't hug me or comfort me AT ALL,  and on the day of the memorial he went into a rage about not \"liking\" any of his current clean clothes.  Literally 1 hour til the memorial starts and he went into a Full blown tantrum because he didn't like the options of clean clothes in his dresser. \nWhich, of course,  was an indirect stab at me for not reading his mind to find out exactly what clothes to wash due to the specific outfits he wanted to wear. \ud83d\ude44", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

For most of the first year we dated, we cohabitated and he paid for virtually nothing. I was a student in college, he lied to me and said he was a student in college but was not taking courses, and did not take courses that entire year. This only bothered me when he was not making an effort to change his situation.\n\nAfter a year of dating, I came back to our apt from being out of town for the weekend, and after taking a look around, I believed he cheated on me. This was due to all of my stuff being stowed away or literally covered up in a apt we shared, but I PAID FOR. There were two game controllers sitting on our bed. I packed up my stuff and moved across the country within a few weeks. \n\nAfter moving across the country, a few months later I got a call from him. He told me he was going to kill himself if I didn't send him money. He was going to use that money to drive to my state, return my belongings, and give me his dog/our dog. Why you may ask? Because he didn't pay rent since I left and he was getting evicted. I sent him money. He kept getting lost because he didn't have data on his phone for GPS. I stayed up all night because he called me incessantly asking for more money for gas. \n\nAfter he arrived, he was in pretty bad health. I made it clear he could stay with me, but he needed to stay on the couch (I had a roommate that knew him from High school coincidentally). He came inside and passed out on my bed. For the next four years, my wishes were never respected. \n\nWe obviously got back together. I was happy to have him in my life, but for the next 5 months, he was jobless, making my living situation with my roommate super hostile, and putting a huge financial strain on me again. \n\nDuring this time, he went on tinder to find \"validation\". One of my female co workers saw him and showed me his profile. I confronted him as soon as I got home, absolutely livid. How dare he violate my trust when he is literally living off me again?! He promised me he never met any of these women, that he was just seeking validation. Yes, everyone, I'm the dumb ass that got talked out of the fact he blatantly cheated. \n\nHe finally got a job and kept that job for years. I was really proud of him. He was trying to do other things too to improve his life/reach goals. I was super supportive, investing in things he needed, connecting him with opportunities. He was doing all the work, I had never been more proud to be his girl. \n\nI never had strong suspicions of him cheating, really ever, besides the time I broke up with him and moved away.  Because he was so unaffectionate unless we were having sex, I questioned his love for me. I was also extremely insecure. I was seeing a therapist at the time (2016-2019).\n\n He proposed to me in January and we moved with the intention of getting better jobs, and hopefully settling down, in a new state. \n\nRight after we moved, he became irrationally paranoid. He didn't want to leave the house. He didn't want to do anything. I was really concerned I would have to support us again, and I just couldn't fiscally afford to. After a week and change into the move, I downloaded tinder and sat in the lobby of my apt building swiping to see if I could find him. I couldn't. I deleted the app and got a few drinks at a bar literally a block away from the apt. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to help him. His behavior was driving me insane. \n\nEarlier that week we were in an argument around moving our furniture in from the pod in the alley. I couldn't move everything myself, I'm 5\"2 and not very strong. He's 6\"2, and very strong. He didn't want to move anything after 3 days of it sitting in the alley, and I raised my voice and he recorded me angrily yelling at him to help me move the shit inside so we wouldn't get the pod ticketed or have to pay extra for it sitting there. \n\nHe uses that video against me to this day, in one of my lowest moments, he tells me \"it reminds him of who I really am\". It makes me feel pretty horrible, and I tell him, but it's like he writes everything I say off because I'm either a narcissist, or a sociopath, or borderline. I've seen therapists throughout my entire life, was never floated that theory, not even remotely. \n\nAbout a week and a half into our move, I got a text from him asking where I was. I had left the house to get us bus passes. I showed him a screenshot of my Google maps and shared my trip with him. It wasn't enough. He had gone through my Google activity and saw I down loaded and deleted tinder, but wouldn't tell me until I got home. He asked for my phone and I complyed. For the next several days (literally 48 hours) I entered the password for any email, social, blog, website, any account he wanted access to. If I denied, I was a cheater. I had nothing to hide, so I complyed fully, hoping when he found nothing, it would be over. The problem was, because he couldn't find anything, the search continued. He would scream at me when I would fall asleep, shove the phone in my face and tell me im this, I'm that. \n\nI eventually went to a hotel after days of harassment and beratement. I was called all the names. I checked into the hotel around 4am, cried myself to sleep, hoping to wake up rested and ready to figure out my next steps.\n\nPsych. I woke up to worried texts and missed calls from my friends and family. My ex sent out this disgusting sexually explicit email to my friends, family, even professional contacts such as my BOSS. He made the mistake of replying to my brother using his email instead of \"posing\" as me, using things that I've said in private to try to alienate me from my family. He also sent pictures of my underwear (underwear had discharge, but he claimed it was another man's ejaculate) around as well. I tried to get his friends and family involved to calm him down. No one would help me.\n\nI filed a immediate protect order / restraining order and it was granted the same day I filed, about a week after the berating abuse/no choice but hotel/email fuckery happened. He showed no remorse and I was honestly afraid what he'd do next. \n\nThis was in March 2019. \n\nSince then, I've been super pathetic in forgiving him and literally begging for him back and going back and forth from nothing to situationship. I really missed him. I missed that feeling of home you get when you are with the person you love. Even if I was super blind to a lot of things, or willing to overlook. \n\nHe tells me I caused him ptsd with the restraining order. I didn't even mention him smashing a guitar inches from my face, smashing his phone, smashing my windshield, telling me to repeatedly kill myself, on the move from our previous home to here earlier this year. It's not apples to apples, but come on...\n\nOh yes, he also calls ME a narcissist. Based off the events, can someone please let me know if I present this? I've been in therapy most of my adolescent and adult life, anxiety and adhd. Adult depression - yay! But apparently I'm a borderline narcissist according to him? Weird, I was also a psychology major...no expert but I didn't feel I presented those symptoms in any way that would qualify me to have those disorders. But of course I didn't know anything in that situation, but if I was being \"emotionally manipulative\" for telling him how I feel, I knew exactly what I was doing because I was a psyc major. Funny how that works...\n\nHe also accused me of gaslighting when he would accuse me of things I never did, and when I tried to defend myself (I was constantly on trial) I was never innocent, I was just gaslighting. Like what the fuck? I didn't do anything wrong...\n\nHe now wants to go no contact. I honestly feel that's the best thing for the both of us. I can't help but feel sad, but at least he can't call me up whenever he sees fit for favors or sex, and I always comply, for me to be let down Everytime I ask for anything, like emotional support, or literally anything. \n\nHow do I get past the hurt of no contact? Knowing him, he'll need something soon and break it. \n\nI don't want to fall back into a pattern where I get verbally abused and financially taken advantage of. He has caused tens of thousands of debt in my name that he doesn't even remotely care about. He doesn't feel responsible. He tells me to just default on the credit lines. \n\nI need help. How do I keep him out of my life. I don't think he means any of this, but it's torture.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I paid rent. He tried to be nice.\n\nThe sex was mind-shattering.\n\nThen I told him I got his sister tickets to visit. I know he was happy. \n\nFirst thing that set him off was that trains werent running when we went to pick her up. I got us an uber. Non-issue.  I was still a retard, useless but of course. \n\nHe didnt make it two days without losing control.\n\nWe stopped by his work for a fag, only to be greeted with demands of coffee. Not requests. I didn't realise that if you cared for someone you need to bring them coffee to work, especially since they're broke, but have more money in their pocket than you. And after actually getting said coffee, of course without thanks, he told us to go- so his sister pulled me out of there. \n\nYou arent supposed to go when you are told to.\n\nHe lost his shit. We ruined his day by showing up there apparently. \n\nShe didnt even want to go back, but I knew that if we don't, we make it worse. \n\nSo I called in reinforcements. \n\nCue his arrival home, slammed doors, fear ensued. We were shaking. Reinforcement probably saved our lives that night. We were screamed at to get out, and reinforcements werent having none of it. After a couple of spliffs he was calmed down. \n\nHe had work in the morning... i still cant believe that was our last kiss. \n\nAfter we've collectively woken up, it didnt take him 20 minutes to go back to threatening texts. Why? Because talking about someone in a room where there is a remotely accessable security camera (with a mic and a speaker to communicate trough) classifies as talking behind someones back? When everyone in that room was discussing how much were worried about you? Yeah, she did say we could've gone for a beer the day before. She was adamant for going for one that night. And that was too much? \n\nIt was less than 24hours. I was too tired to argue. He told us to leave the room I not so long ago paid rent for, but was suddently all his again. \n\nI started packing. \n\nWe went for a spliff before leaving, he threatened the police on us. \n\nSo we left. \n\nThen he went nuclear.\n\nWe werent 20 minutes from the house, when our phones started exploding. Then the links. \n\nI knew he could do it. I expected him to do it last time... but last time he felt bad about the other girl, it didnt fit the agenda, did it, dear? Posting porn of your partner, be it ex or present, I thought that was beneath you... \n\nHe threatened my job. \n\nHe threatened anyone who he thought would stand by me.\n\nI vaguely rememberred that revenge porn was illegal. Shaking, I called 101. The police met with us not half an hour later, taking me to the station to take a statement. \n\nSitting at the back of the police van, I was still getting threats. To be frank, I was least worried about myself. I couldn't have him go nuclear on others. \n\nThen they started asking questions. \n\nHas he ever beat you. Has he ever choked you. Has he ever alienated you from family or friends? Has he ever threatened to kill you or anyone else? \n\nThat one was a trigger... Specially after they saw the texts. They were still incomming. \n\nYou wanted me to kill myself. \n\nThat was your end goal.\n\nAll I ever wanted was to just... be. With you.\n\nTears were freeflowing allready when they told me he was going to be arrested. All I could think of was that none of this would've happened if he had some self control.\n\nI couldn't process any of it. How nice the police officers were to me. How fucked up all of this was. I managed to ask the important questions though. Got therapy resources. I got scared how he'd respond. Resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer would be two additional charges... I know he's smart, but not going to lie, I didn't know how he would react.\n\nAfter taking the statement they took me back to his sister, waiting for me at the park. \n\nThe next two hours I had a pit in my stomach the size of a fist. \n\nThank fuck his sister kept reminding me that it was him who'd done those things. I still couldnt be worried about me. I was worried about what I had done. Kept thinking that the morning kiss was our last.\n\nDragging my life across the city once more. I took us into a room I had lined up last month, thank fuck it was still available. I wasnt going to be homeless because he decided to be a dick. I wasn't going to let him destroy her holiday. \n\nWe got a phonecall after he was arrested, letting us know he didnt resist arrest.. *he was surprised*. Later on, another officer called me, and either they didnt even read the report, but it wasnt the same officers who took my statement... I had to explain to them that he wasnt my pimp. It took everything I had in me to recap quickly that this was a 5 year relationship with a controlling narcisist who was now trying to destroy me... and that he had no right to distribute any images, much less the explicit kind. \n\nWe were told hed be in hold for 24 hours, but got a text next morning at 6 that he was released on bail with a condition to not contact me or his sister directly or indirectly. \n\nShe didnt even give a statement. \n\nThey extended the restraining order solely on screenshots. They called me to try to get her to make a statement. It wasn't something we were gonna do. We just wanted to be safe, not terrified... not start a war.\n\n\nThe sad part is, I still think he can be better than this. \n\n\nIts been two days back at work, with this crap going on in the background, and his birthday is tomorrow. \n\nPeople are still comming to the house to celebrate.\n\nI am making her go, even if she says thats redundant to the purpose of consequences to his actions... because we cant stoop to his level. She promised their mother. I wont go there myself, because I know me being there would make things worse. And anyway, not like he wants me there. Just cant be alone, so we'll make sure he wont be. \n\n\nEveryone keeps asking me how I'm feeling. I don't have the words to describe how dissapointed I am. Betrayed. Used. Abused. Exposed. Berated. \n\nThis story is far from over. But this is where I am right now. We havent spoken for 3 days, she blocked him from all my accounts, I couldn't do it myself.

We have not necessarily been dating for a long time (about a year), but things have gotten pretty serious and we do foresee a long future together.\n\n\nBut - as I currently live a little further away - my reactions to my symptoms (lack of communication, talking to him less, dissociating when we are around each other, and general sensitivity to being touched in any way and occasionally affirmations of love make me uncomfortable) have begun to shift things negatively and it's harder for me to pull my weight as much as I should.\n\n\nI am concerned my struggles have been contributing to his anxiety as well.

It's been so long since I've seen him, and in the time in between I heard he was blaming me for all his troubles.  So I fully expected him to be kind of cold and distant, and I figured this might be my only change to tell him how his behavior hurt me.\n\nBut we actually had a nice conversation and he hugged me the moment he saw me.  We caught up for awhile and he told me that he has been very unhappy.  He told me that he hates the new city we moved to and that he has no friends.  He doesn't even talk to the few friends he had, including the guy he dumped me for.  He's very lonely and he's had some health issues.  He's started taking Wellbutrin to manage his depression.  This kind of took me aback because I expected a narcissist to keep up the mask of a perfect life without me.  But he shared his vulnerability with me and even said he regrets that we don't talk anymore.  He also said he feels bad that I moved my life to this new city to be with him only to end up on my own.\n\nIt was a nice conversation and I know it's awful to say, but it made me feel a little better to know that he's been suffering since I left.  I was so caught off guard that I suddenly remembered that I meant to tell him about how he hurt me.  The moment I started talking about it though, he bolted.  He picked up his coat and said \"I don't want to hear about this.  Why don't you put your thoughts in a letter.\"  He moved to hug me goodbye but I stopped him.  I felt totally dismissed.  Later he texted me \"I'm sorry, but that was a painful time for me too, and I just didn't want to be reminded of it.\"\n\nLater, I wrote him a very long email listing all the things he did and how they hurt me.  It wasn't an angry rant or anything, but I did get a little worked up by the end.  In the end, I wrote that I would like to salvage a friendship between us, but that requires clearing the air about everything.  He merely replied \"I don't read your emails.\"  Which says to me that he did read it but didn't like what he saw.\n\nIt seemed to me that I angered or annoyed him, so I just left him alone.  Then a couple of weeks later, he texted me that he found something of mine at the house.  I told him I didn't really need it, so he could toss it out.  I asked if he'd like to do something for Thanksgiving, but he said he and his husband were going to be away that day (this was a poly relationship).  I said \"Well maybe we can do something out some time\" to which he replied \"Perhaps we could.\"  And that was that.\n\nI'm kind of confused.  I don't think a true narcissist would share his vulnerability with me.  I figured he'd hate me for calling him out on his behavior, but it sounds like he misses me, maybe not as a boyfriend but as a friend.  But I think he must know that he hurt me and he knows what he did was wrong, and that's what pushed him away.  I don't know if a narcissist would feel that kind of guilt.  I'd really like to maintain some kind of friendship with him.  We've been through a lot the last 8 years, and it's sad that we're estranged when we're both so lonesome and unhappy in our new city.  I know that we are not good for each other in terms of having a relationship, but I think we are still attached to each other as friends.

Firstly, I believe that she is in an abusive relationship. She's shown up to work on a few occasions with bruises around the face. Once on the forehead, and another on an arm, and one under her eye. One time I saw her boyfriend grab her by the back of the head/neck, playing it off as cute and endearing, but it was definitely a power move and looked scary, even my fiance said that it raised red flags for him when he experienced it. The two or three times I've been around him he's been quick to anger and openly called her stupid. This guy is about 20 years younger than her and is definitely using her. He used her to buy him a new truck, and then totalled it about a month later with one of her kids in the car. How'd he total it? Doing donuts in an empty lot with her child in the back seat. He has no job, and I'm assuming doesn't contribute to any bills or help her in any way. She's constantly having to go home on her 30 minute break to take him breakfast in bed, as if he wasn't a grown ass adult. Just to give an example of what kind of giant baby this guy is, he once called her at work asking her to go buy stamps, even though he was home and perfectly capable of doing it himself. She then started crying because he was screaming at her to get stamps, but she was at work with another few hours left to go on her shift, so she couldn't leave. And this was just over stamps.\n\nWhat worries me most is that she has 4 kids (ranging from 8-16 years old) from a previous marriage living under the same roof as this guy, and I'm also worried for their safety. On this note, my coworker has been having custody battles and child support issues with her ex husband, which has been making her very stressed. She showed up to work on various occasions clearly high on something. She later disclosed that she had taken xanax to ease her nerves. However, myself and other coworkers could clearly see that she was abusing it. She would be extremely groggy at work, falling asleep by the food ovens (we work at a local coffee shop), slurring her words, and even falling asleep on the grass outside of our work building. She seems to be better now, but you never know which version of \"coworker\" you're going to get. She's either high, or quick to anger, or self-hating. A fellow coworker tried talking to her about the drug problem because it was getting ridiculously out of hand and we didn't want her getting fired or losing her kids. She was too high to comprehend anything though. Her drug habit has gotten so out of hand that one of the school psychologists had her daughter write a letter to \"coworker\" asking her to please stop doing drugs.This is why I'm worried about her kids, who knows what the hell is going on at home.  Lately she's been crying a lot and saying very self-depreciative comments. She's always saying things like \"yea I know im stupid\" and \"It's always my fault, I know I'm always the screw-up.\" Even today she came back from her break after going (im assuming) home in complete tears. Another coworker let slip that \"coworker\" told her that this past week she had been thinking of all the ways to end her life. This threw up a giant red flag for me, as I struggle with depression and I know to take these kinds of comments seriously. I believe it's a cry for help on her part. \n\nSo this is where I need help I guess. I don't know what to do about it. I'm not close with her and I don't want to get dragged into her life, but I don't know how to confront her without her getting defensive, and I'm sure just because I talk to her she's not going to leave her abusive boyfriend. I don't want to be the reason she loses her kids either, they are everything to her and she is extremely hard-working and caring, which is why this behavior is beyond alarming. Has anyone experienced a similar situation? Anyone know who I could contact to help her? I just don't know.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

But this time apart I've been reflecting and realizing how manipulative he is:\n\n I was moving to a new state but I decided to visit first, and i ended up meeting him through a dating app. We hit it off really well, and when I went back to my home state we would talk all the time. I did not like him romantically and we settled on being friends. But he would call me all the time. He told me that I could stay at his place for a little until I got on my feet. Since we had been talking so much, i agreed.\n\n  Right before I moved, i saw a girl he had posted on his story. I asked about her because I didn't want to intrude and disrespect their relationship by living with him in his studio. he said they were just fwb and that she knew about me.\n\n  Fast forward, i move out here and am staying with him. Job hunting and keeping to myself. He gets me a job where he works and starts doing all sorts of nice things for me that I'm not used to. Taking me out on trips, dates, telling me how he wanted to make my life easy since I had it hard. He ended up cutting off the other girl (later found out he ghosted her) and then we start dating. So perhaps I deserved this\n\n\n\n  But it started small at first. I noticed he would slightly chip away at me with small remarks. But they were so tiny, I didn't know if I was just...bringing my past trauma into the relationship. I remember at one point, (we're black but he talks alot about how he prefers white blonde women) he made a remark about not inviting me out with his friends and how i probably think it's because i'm not a white blonde girl. then, he would make remarks about people being performative and fake deep, then reference stuff that i posted online. he would take posts of mine and just accuse me of being fake and then would talk about my appearance ( i have a more alternative appearance and change it up a lot, i also was getting into modeling and when i asked him about it he would just say oh i don't know if you could). At this time, I started getting sick...it was weird. I started getting joint pains and anytime we would fight, I wouldn't be able to move my legs. I also had high blood pressure but thought it was from work. He kept insisting that I don't have to pay any living expenses, and also suggested i work part time due to my health. So i did. At this time, my friend from home had moved out here and was staying with us temporarily. After a few days, she had a serious talk with me telling me that she felt like he was mentally abusive towards me and how she could tell that it was taking a toll on me. I spent most of the day sleeping and was sick a lot and hardly left the house. He also had a huge blanket covering the single window so there was no light except for the lamp. I tried taking it down and he flipped out saying he was the one who paid rent not me, he also did this when i hung up a tapestry. I was never allowed to put anything up because it was his place. She tried getting me to move with her but he scared me out of it saying how his friend who moved on his own lost his mind and how he felt like my friend was trying to break things up between us for selfish purposes.\n\n  Later, I realized this was a manipulation tactic so he could tell everyone how he was doing everything around the house and how I was just working part time not paying for anything. But yeah, i started a part time job and the holidays are very hard for me bc of growing up in an abusive household and also because my brother died new years day. I remember he went back to his hometown for christmas and i was really upset because i missed my brother and had to work and was alone and i texted him and he told me that i was ruining his mood and dismissed me. He painted me out to be this person who was needy and didn't do anytihng to help him and made people feel sorry for him, and i didn't realize this until later\n\n\n  A month later, this is when I saw his first blow up. I was tripping on acid, and we were with my friends (the one who lives out her and her sister who was visiting) mind you these are my two best friends. His friend was with us as well and we went to a karaoke bar. It was a fun night, until we were waiting outside and I asked a guy for a piece of gum. As soon as I asked, my ex jumped in from out of nowhere saying how I was taken and that I was his girlfriend. I got irritated with him because I had just asked for gum and he was being rude. I walked away and he got mad. I asked the guys for gum again and the one guy said \"yeah if that's not your boyfriend\" and I said \"he is, what does that have to do with anything\" and then I said nevermind and went and bought some.\n\n  When we got home, he FLIPPED OUT on me. I can't remember everything but my friends were so upset they tried making me leave with them but I had work the next day and said no. When they left he got in my face screaming at me, cussed me out, was saying I was manipulative and all this stuff. I shoved him lightly because he was yelling so much and swearing and making gestures with his hands that were triggering bc i have ptsd from being abused and he pinned me down with my arm behind my back. I admit I shouldn't have pushed him but I was scared. He kept shoving my head into the bed not all that hard but since  Iwas tripping i was terrified. and then the next day he said  Iwas in the wrong and how his friend agreed.\n\n\n  and over time the fights got worse. I don't even know how to explain them but anytime we would fight I'd end up feeling like my head was going to explode and I'd feel confused and disoriented. I also relapsed into self harm after years of not doing so. I don't know why it was like I lost control. And then I began feeling like i was losing my mind and I  couldn't trust myself. I almost admtted myself to the psych ward and became very suicidal because I didn't know what was wrong with me.\n\n  Everytime I'd bring up his behavior, he would say how he did everything for me and how I was ungrateful and how women just use men for resources. And I just kept getting sicker, i gained 45 pounds and became agoraphobic.  I also can't even remember a few months because i was dissociated. A few months ago, we went to my hometown to see my family. My mom and him had a conversation that ended up in her having a panic attack because he at first was telling my mom how i was a terrible person and then told her that i \"never forgave her\" for all the stuff that happened in my childhood which isn't true. My mom and i had a falling out because she had a xanax addiction and then she got clean and apologized for everything and i even told him this. but he was saying all of this stuff to her and then she sent me a long text on how sorry she was and how she loved me and wishes she would've done things differently so i confronted him. and you know what he said? that she wouldn't have apologized if it werent for him and how he makes things happen all the time then kept saying how if it weren't for him  she woulnd't have apologized and i wouldn't be in this city. we also almst missed our flight because of traffic and he texted his mom talking badly about me but held his phone so that I could see it.\n\n\n  He also went to another country with his friends and bragged about how i wasn't going and was really mean about it and then when i got upset bc i wanted to go, he said that i was selfish and how he does all this stuff for me and now i expect more out of him. He said he wanted to go to A certain place known for sex and partying but I told him i wasn't comfortable with that, and he promised not to go. I later found out he lied and when i confrotned him he cussed me out and called me all these names and then i found him in the geo tag and screenshot it and then he said it was my fault he lied. he also cheated on me while he was out there. i was using his macbook and saw he looked for a morning after pill in spain but he swore up and down it was for his friend but later i found out he cheated and has been in love with this girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a lot more, but I don't want to type out too much since this is already long. But i've tried breaking up with him and he would guilt trip me or say how his friend committed suicide bc  the city was too overwhelming for him. And when I finally broke up with him for the final time, he got all calm and told me that I was a terrible person who sucks the life out of everyone and he used my mental illness against me and told me that I'm always wrong and basically that i deserved to be abused as a kid and how i probably lied. i had a panic attack and he laughed and asked if he should call 911 since i apparently couldnt breathe. i threw up from being so upset and he yelled and said \"you better f\\*cking clean that up\" and then my friends picked me up and he messaged them pretending to be all concerned.\n\n\n\nHe also sent me all these texts saying how i'm a terrible person, how I'm not pure, how everyone is going to leave me because I'm a terrible partner and how I added no value to his life.\n\n\n\n  He also had us hang out with this ex (the girl he was talking to when i moved here) and her new boyfriend because he wanted her to help him with his youtube channel. He thinks that he is better than everyone and that he is special and the world needs to know. So we meet up, and she talks to me about him and how he treated her the same way and ghosted her and she had to go to the psych ward because he made her feel terrible about herself. we both realized how he manipulated us both and also other people to make us look like we used him.\n\nL\n\nI've been having limited contact with him, but he won't tell me when he is going to be back and called me yesterday being all nice saying i could stay here as long as i needed and how he just cared about mysafety. I think it was because he was around people and wanted to look good.\n\n\n\n\n\n but since being away from him, i have been feeling so clear headed and healthier. I feel like i was literally under a spell because i have no idea what i ever saw in him or what even happened the past year. it is all a blur. i also developed a drinking problem while being with him. I still feel disoriented from being gaslit so much. it's just crazy how these people function. he manipulated a whole situation to make himself look a certain way. thank you for listening \n\nTL;Dr figuring out that my ex is most likely a narc", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I got mysteriously ill when we were engaged. (He wasn\u2019t doing anything outright to physically make me ill. As in not poisoning my food, etc. I got diagnosed later with several conditions that explained my symptoms.) We got married so I could be on his health insurance, but more importantly, he said, was so he could \u201ctake care of me\u201d. Throughout the marriage I became sicker and sicker. He always pushed for the most extreme treatment, testing, etc. I went through a lot of painful experiences that were in retrospect, unnecessary. All of them at his insistence. I think he enjoyed me suffering. If I didn\u2019t want to do a test or questioned what he suggested he got rageful, claimed I was ungrateful, and didn\u2019t want to get better. He bragged to family and co-workers about how he was doing such a good job of taking care of me. Yet, in private he resented me and said I was stopping him from succeeding at work. All his failures were my fault. He told my family he knew more than the doctors did because of his job. He was not in a medical field but had some general training in it. When I finally got a diagnosis with some answers, he left me very soon after out of the blue. I used to think it was partially because he didn\u2019t want to deal with a sick wife for the rest of his life, but now I wonder if it isn\u2019t the opposite. That maybe he didn\u2019t want a wife he couldn\u2019t take all the credit for taking care of. That now there were real experts to give me advice, he couldn\u2019t be the most knowledgeable. That I might start to improve and he\u2019d be the hero no more. Soon after he left I improved a great deal in my physical health. Is this common or semi-common narcissistic and or sociopath (he\u2019s both) behavior? Did anyone else here deal with a similar situation?

We met freshman year but started dating my sophomore year after he denied me and basically said that he led me on. Then he texted me after summer and we started talking again. I thought he was a different person, but I was so wrong. There were so many red flags I ignored and I just chose to suffer for a little over a year hoping I could fix him. My therapist after hearing all the things he did to me thinks he is a narcissist. For example, when we were texting one time (and he did this frequently) he was talking about his summer job and the people he met. I was getting a little self-conscious and asked him if there were any girl he hung around a lot. He said not really, but then he started telling about this one girl with big boobs (I\u2019m flat chested and insecure about it) and I asked him if she was pretty and he said that he wanted to fuck her in the tool shed they had. I started crying obviously because it was really disturbing. He said it was only a joke and that I should just get over it and that he was sorry. I broke up with him last year, but have still been having trouble moving on from all the abuse and even him. I see him everyday, but he never tries to talk to me or anything. I just constantly scared and worried and so many other feelings that ultimately leave me lost and confused. I was wondering if anyone had any tips for me to help me move past this so I can get on with my life? I just feel like I\u2019m not worth anything anymore.

By that time, though, I was already emotionally destroyed and done. I had put 7 years into what felt like a completely one sided relationship. **I** had been the thoughtful and accommodating one for all those years. I had put up with snide comments and manipulation, gaslighting, backhanded treatment from his mother... just so much. I was not proud of who I was for our 8th year.

Do you tell them?", "author": "Throwaway04552399", "self_text": "I (f26) started talking to this guy, let's call him Daniel, on a dating app a little over a month ago. I asked if he wanted to grab a cup of coffee and he said yes. We were both kinda busy at the time, but we continued talking until we had the time to meet up. A week or so after I started talking to Daniel, I went drinking with some friends. We drank a lot and I blacked out. I don't really want to go into the details, but I was raped that night. I don't remember much of it, I don't even remember what the guy looked like. The next morning I went to the hospital to secure evidence after calling a helpline, and then I deleted all dating apps, and traveled to my hometown to stay at my parents house for a while. The first days were the worst. I was sad and angry and scared all the time. I couldn't sleep, and I kept trying to convince myself that it didn't really happen and at the same time that it was my fault, somehow. God, I hate my brain sometimes.  \nAnyway, a couple of days later I got a text from Daniel, who was wondering if I was okay since he hadn't heard from me in a while. I had decided that I didn't want to meet him, or anyone, but I found his concern sweet, and he seemed like an interesting guy, so I thought there was no harm in just meeting him. So I did. He was smart and funny and I liked him. He asked if I wanted to see him again and I said yes. We went out again, and again it was nice. He didn't really make a move or anything, which was okay with me.   \nBut this weekend I went to his place to see a movie. After the movie we were just hanging out. I ended up staying until past midnight, and when I was supposed to leave we realized that the last bus had already left. I obviously really didn't want to walk home in the middle of the night. He said I could stay the night, so I did. I kinda like this guy, so I didn't really mind, but I was also scared. I slept in his bed, because there wasn't really an alternative. While we were lying there, he put his hand gently on my cheek and he kissed me. It was a nice kiss and, tbh, I was really into it. He was so sweet and nice and he kept asking me if I was okay. But at one time he pulled my hair while we were kissing and I got mad flashbacks and sort of started shaking. I thought I was going to start crying. I kept pulling back slightly and we didn't have sex. A part of me really, really wanted to, but I was also terrified. So confusing.   \nIn the morning he just went to take a shower and I left as soon as he came back. The whole thing felt really awkward, and now I feel so bad. We have only met three times and we haven't really talked about serious stuff, so I didn't feel like I could tell him about what happened, but maybe I should have? I also felt like I was acting so strange when I was at his place, and I think that was mostly because of what happened and that I was uncomfortable with being there alone with him. I have a feeling he won't want to meet again, and maybe that's for the best right now. But if I do meet him again, when should I tell him about it? Or should I tell him at all? I don't want to scare him away, if I haven't already done that. But I also don't want to make him feel bad if we have sex and then I tell him later that parts of it was uncomfortable for me. Again, this problem might solve itself if he doesn't want to see me again. But I'm probably going to date again in the future. How and when do you tell someone you're dating about something like this?   \n\n\nHe also jokingly called me worthless at some point.

I made friends with the other kids on the block quickly.  Unfortunately, one of those friends had a father that was a predator and just so happens they ended up my closest friends at the time. I don\u2019t remember my exact age of the first incident, but it\u2019s the only incident I remember in detail. It was when their father had the first opportunity to \u201cprime\u201d me. He set up a perfect scenario  to learn if I could successfully be his victim, his play thing that he could manipulate, control, use, and abuse. But before he could cross the line without getting caught, he had know if I could keep a secret.  He put me through a test. A series of questions, displays of lingerie, and photos of sexy women, like a Victoria secret catalog. He pulled his wife\u2019s lingerie sets out from a drawer in their bedroom and laid them out on display on the bed. He asked if I\u2019d ever seen anything like it before, if I thought it was sexy, and if my mom had anything like this at home. I don\u2019t know my exact response, but I knew didn\u2019t feel right, it felt icky, weird, uncomfortable.. but by this point I was so close with his family, went to church with them, had sleepovers, birthday parties.. he was like a father figure. He told me I couldn\u2019t tell anyone about this, it was our special secret and I would get in a lot of trouble I did. I wouldn\u2019t be able to play with my friends anymore and everyone would be very upset and he would be very disappointed in me, I didn\u2019t want that to happen, I didn\u2019t want to get in trouble, I didn\u2019t want to make everyone mad at me, now did I? Of course not. He sent me on my way to leave before his wife and daughters got back from running errands. I went home that day and kept my mouth shut. I was scared and ashamed and confused. I\u2019m pretty sure I rummaged through my moms underwear drawers to see if she in fact had anything like I had just seen. I found her VS catalogs and curiously looked through more pictures of women in the lingerie he showed me. This is what sexy is (?). The incidents progressed once he knew I passed the test and he trusted me to keep our secret. Almost everyday I went around the block, knock on the door to ask if my friends could play. If there was ever a day they were out with their mom, he would tell me come inside. I wanted to run away every single time, but I would do as he say because I didn\u2019t think I had a choice. He would  lead me down the hall, into his bedroom and close the door. He stood over me, his dick visibly getting hard under his khaki pants as he pressed himself closer to me. I couldn\u2019t help but stare at it, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before. He asked if I wanted to touch it and said it was okay, don\u2019t be scared, it\u2019ll feel good I promise. No one will know but us, go ahead now touch it. Reluctantly, I reached out my hand and felt the lump protruding from his trousers. He put his hand over mine and rubbed while he moaned and told me how sexy it was and how good it felt for me to touch him. When he was done, he reminded me not to tell anyone and told me what a good girl I was. With each opportunity that knocked on his door, the abuse progressed. He pressed his erection against me and pressed his hand on my privates asking if it felt good and telling me how good it felt to him. He began to rub the lump in his pants against my vagina and tell me I was sexy. Before too long he was unzipping his pants and baring himself to me, stroking himself and forcing me to touch it with him. He would reach his hand under my panties using his fingers to rub my clitoris until I experienced my first orgasm. And now I understood what he meant by it feeling good. No matter what age, orgasms feel good to everyone whether you know what it is your body is feeling or not. These moments have affected every aspect of my life. I repressed all of it as a child, I completely detached. I was in high school when the first flashback happened and I still kept the secret. I spiraled down a lifestyle of partying, drugs, and promiscuity. I had no sense of self, no sense of belonging, no sense of worth Relationships with family, friends, boyfriends were seemingly plagued. To this day, I don\u2019t even have someone I would consider a best friend. No one would ever understand me, no one would ever love me, I was nothing but a play thing for other peoples pleasure. I thought if I gave myself to someone they would want me to stay, it was the only way someone could love me. 25 years later I still don\u2019t know how to maintain a healthy relationship. It\u2019s a lot for someone else to understand your trauma and your triggers especially when  they barely even make sense to you. How could someone else make sense of them either? How can I expect someone to have the patience to mull over all the triggers that are constantly pushed in the beginning of a new relationship without making them feel like I\u2019m blaming them bc their actions/reactions hit one of my many triggers?

I have been continuing to make music and put on a strong front, but I'm still devastated. She found new supply after a month, and last night I finally decided to unfriend her on  facebook. I feel like I broke NC in a way by doing so, that I had been doing the best I could to continue on \"without giving a damn\". But something had to give. I know I should be proud to have made that step, but I just feel like it was a mistake.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This is also the first time I've really used the word abuser, although I've always known it. \n\nMy older brother has always been abusive towards me, since the time I was very young. I don't have a lot of childhood memories due to it, since he used to be worse when he was younger. Physical/mental/emotional abuse was my everyday at home, and although my mother tried her best to raise him, I think he was just born with little to no empathy, along with ODD which gave my mom a hard time. I remember him pushing and punching me, yelling at me a lot, and I can't remember him using my name ever, instead picking whatever insult he wanted to refer to me as. My size, my ability, my intelligence were always weaponized. I only called the police on him once, but nothing came of it, and in his words, he \"won\". \n\nHe moved out a few years ago, but he still comes back to visit every other week and stays for a few days. He doesn't work and he mooches off my grandmother (who he lives with). Every moment he's in the house with me I'm tense. I know the chance of him moving out and staying away is slim to none, so I started to plan my way out. I'm saving my money and working, planning on finishing school, and the second I'm financially able to, I'm out of here. My fantasies for the future involve me living a life I'm happy with, and never seeing him again. He'll never know where I live, never hurt me again. My family have always been the type to love family no matter what, because he's \"my brother\" I have to love him? No way. I only hang around him due to family obligation, holidays and birthdays. I don't talk to him regularly because I know he'll twist my words to argue about something. The moment I don't have close family that ties me to him (dad/grandma) I'll never see him again. I'm looking forward to it.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

When we met I heard so much about how he just loved my amazing energy/vibes, etc.  He told me that he could feel it from all the way across the room when he first saw me and that he was drawn to me because of it.  I am a sexual abuse survivor.  I have a medical problem that has caused me some pretty significant setbacks in life.  I was also raised by abusive alcoholics.  Despite all that I went to college, got a degree in a field I am passionate about and now own my own company in that field.  I am by no means rich, but I do alright for myself doing something I love.  I thought these were probably all things he could sense about me and this was why he loved my energy so much.\n\nOver time I started realizing that just about every woman he meets who is even remotely attractive has good energy in his eyes.  He never commented on any man's energy or on the energy of someone who was unattractive.  (I don't consider myself all that attractive really.  I'm average looking I guess.  But I am very colorful.  I have tattoos.  My hair is usually some crazy combo of colors (purple and green currently)  And I dress in clothes that are pretty different.\n\nWe were together for three years.  First two years were fine.  Last year... suddenly he hates the way I run my company.  He hates how I look, and most of all he hates my energy.  He started talking about other women he knows and how beautiful they are and how they have such beautiful energy.  He even wanted to cuddle with this one woman he knows because he just needed to feel her beautiful energy to recharge after having to deal with my oh-so-nasty energy so much.\n\nThis is something I've been kind of obsessing about since we broke up.  Is my energy really that bad?  Etc...  So tonight I went online and looked at a couple of lists of ways to improve my energy.   There were several things that were pretty much on all the lists.  And you know what... I do most of these things.  One thing was keep a gratitude list. I've done that for years. Every night before bed I write down ten things I'm grateful for.  Another thing was to be colorful.  Another was to sing/whistle to yourself.  This is another thing I do.  (In fact, this was something he would complain about from time to time.)  Compliment strangers... I do that all the time.  There were other things but this is just what I remember off the top of my head.\n\nI just wanted to send him all these links and tell him to kiss my fucking ass.  I wonder if deep down he knows it's actually his energy that sucks and he was drawn to mine because he knows that's the only way he will ever have it.\n\nSo to him... fuck you.  My energy doesn't need you polluting it asshole.  Nw I'm gonna go crank up some Pink Floyd and sing along because you used to hate that MFR.\n\nToodles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:    I wrote this right before bed last night.

Occasionally I find myself wondering if certain experiences with my husband are him being emotionally abusive (intentional or not), or if it's just a coincidence/me reading too much into things (yay traumatic and abusive childhood). Mostly I'm seeing what feels like low-key gaslighting and \"You call me out on my bs and I act sad and hurt like I'm the one who's being picked on.\"  Excuse the novel.   \n\n\nAs kind of a base line, the first two incidents that have stuck in my mind are probably 8-9 years ago.  In one, that I'd nearly forgotten about, DH was fidgeting with his wedding ring and lost it down a heating vent in our floor.  Okay, bummer, but it wasn't expensive and we moved on.  Several months later he asked me what happened to it because he remembered giving it to me while he did something, and did I misplace it/lose it?  (Yay poor memory or gaslighting, idk).  Around the same time (maybe within a year), I found out that he had been sexting on social media with a woman he knew from when he was a teenager.  When I approached him about it, he started crying and saying that he just felt so distant from me and that he needed someone to make him feel important.  When we had the \"seriously, stop messaging with her even if it's not sexting,\" conversation, his response was that \"I still want to be able to be fb friends with her; I consider her a friend.\"  Yes, I called BS on both of those and recognized them for the emotional manipulation they were.    \n\n\nSo, more recently (within the past year or so), I've noticed a lot of little things that technically seem like emotionally abusive behaviors, but they seem so much on that line that I'm wondering if they are or not.  DH is trying to lose weight (doing awesome at going to the gym, not so great at portion control).  His solution has been to buy a bunch of Amy's Organic Bowls because they're proportioned and he likes them.  Okay, cool, but when I asked him about why he was buying essentially tv dinners instead of just portioning out our family meals (which he had really pushed for us to be better about having, cooking at home, etc btw, even though he didn't want to eat them?  idk), he sulked and was really quiet for a couple of days.  When I asked him about it, he said that I made him feel really bad/hurt because he was just trying to be healthier and I chewed him out for it.    \n\n\nTonight has felt like a series of events.  Before dinner, it was DH asking me where some of our plates were and me reminding him that I put them away because he thought we had too many.  No, he said, he just said we should wash them more.  I called BS, and that kind of stalled out, we made dinner, awesome. Our conversation over the course of a tv episode after eating was (1) would I get up with him in the morning if he exercised at home instead of going to the gym, (2) that he was going to give me a back rub this morning but things got busy, (3) me saying that I'd love a backrub tonight because my back was being weird earlier today, (4) him saying that it'd feel better if I exercised/was healthier, (6) me asking (partially seriously and partially teasing, not sure what he was meaning or where this was going) \"So, you said you'd give be a back rub but that the only reason it hurts is because I'm fat?\" and (7) DH doing the sad \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you think that...\"  As a wrap up, DH was getting ready to join an online game, came upstairs telling me that he had some weird intestinal pain (he has gall bladder attacks sometimes, but different), visibly and vocally in pain, asked me to sit with him for a minute, told me where it hurt, I rubbed his back for a minute, asked him if he wanted me to exit him out of his game, and then was all better less than a minute later and ready to play.  I feel like a cynic or a jerk doubting whether or not he was really in pain or faking it; it's not the position I ever wanted to be in.  \n\n\nAnyway, if you stuck with me through the novel, what do you do when you can't decide whether you're experiencing emotional abuse, if it's intentional or not, or if you're just sensitive to certain things because of your past?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

She has BPD and is an extreme covert narc.  Last September a couple of friends informed me about all the lies, manipulations, and disrespect to me she had been displaying since practically day one of her and her equally insane and jealous girlfriend moving in with them. (She and her gf lied to me about why they were being evicted from the house they had trashed and failed to pay rent on for 11 months so that I would help them find a place, move, and loan her money I can't actually afford for gas, car insurance, etc. I made the mistake of hooking them up with said friends who were in desperate need of roommates to make ends meet.)\n\nThis led me to start asking around about her, and lo and behold, she had been fairly openly hateful, usurious, conniving, disrespectful, and demeaning toward me behind my back the whole time I knew her. (I'm 32 and have known her since I was 15.) Meanwhile I had been defending her every time someone tried to talk crap about her around me, giving her tons of time, energy, and money, being there for her when no one else could be bothered, etc etc. To my face she was my best friend and cared so much about me and was my person (Grey's Anatomy reference), blah blah blah. I was just her \"favorite person\" until someone with pussy, more money, or free drugs came along. The more I learn about Cluster B folks the angrier I get. Everything about her fits their patterns.\n\nI have autism, bipolar disorder, C-PTSD, anxiety, have attempted suicide twice (both times were triggered by her behavior toward me -- she was the match to the tinder of all my other struggles) and grew up in an extremely homophobic redneck area, so my ability to relate to people and make and keep friends was quite limited for a very long time. I fell in love with her early on (eventually got over it after she hurt me too many times and fucked her body up with meth and heroin). She knew all of this and took full advantage of it. She targeted me for supply and I was too stupid to realize it because of how desperate I was to have someone to connect with, and because of how unthinkable that sort of ignoble behavior is to me. How do these people live with themselves? How was I so naive that I accepted her shallow apologies and took over a decade to understand it was all a pattern?\n\nThis chick, knowing full well how intense my feelings were for her at the time, literally betrayed me so she could screw the woman who sexually assaulted me, AFTER it was made abundantly clear that the woman was an unforgivably horrible sociopath. She seduced two of my other exs while I was still dating them. She borrowed hundreds of dollars with zero intention or serious effort to pay it back (when I was so disabled I could only manage to make an average of maybe around $500/mo washing dishes), then joyrided around buying tons of stupid shit like fast food on my dime and acted like I was a crazy bitch for being angry about it when I became aware of what was going on. She laughed at me behind my back with all these other people, after I gave her so much of myself for so long. The stress of being embroiled in all her drama is what I believe led to my mental illness ramping up into full-blown psychotic mania. If she had never been in my life I probably wouldn't have developed bipolar and would have been able to finish university and become a therapist like I always wanted instead of having a shitty manual labor job and living in public housing.\n\nIt's been so many months but every single day the shame, humiliation, and agony of it all still makes me feel like every centimeter of my body is being jabbed with 1000 red hot pokers at once. Every day I want to scream myself hoarse. Every day I get reminded of her in some way and have another revelation about her real motives and behavior over the years. Every day I have intrusive thoughts of beating her face in with a metal baseball bat or choking her until the light goes out of her eyes. I know it's fucked up, but I don't know how to shut it off. Everything to do with her is just the cherry on top of the shit cake of my life that was already filled to the brim with abuse and bullshit. All the times I couldn't fight back as a kid when I was being beaten, bullied, insulted, silenced, etc... all the meltdowns, emotional suffocation, and inability to get justice... all those feelings are flooding me all the time now, and the revelations about her last year are what set it off. And the fact that these people never actually feel bad for anything they do? Makes me want to explode.\n\nAll the advice I've gotten so far has been worthless. People just don't get it. The depth of it, especially stretched out over that long and piled on top of so many other problems... I'm starting to become convinced that this plane is a hellscape, at least for those of us who've endured this amount of shit. I don't really know what I'm hoping to accomplish by posting this, but I had to get it out of my system somewhere. Maybe someone will see their experience reflected in it or have insight or something. Idk.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He was older than my brother by at least two years.\n\nFrom what I can remember, I was 13 and he was 19.\n\nI am still not sure of this because a lot of it is foggy still sometimes. I am sitting here with a journal entry of mine from Jan 1, 2012 when I had just turned 14 a couple months prior. This journal entry was the first time I ever really talked about it because it had been bugging me for a little bit (little did I know it would continue to mess with me for years to come).\n\nAnyway, even in this journal I can't quite remember when it happened. I started the journal off by saying I couldn't remember if it had been earlier in 2011 or in 2010. And that was when it was still fresh yet I couldn't remember correctly.\n\nSo, this friend would single me out wherever in the house I was and give me \"special attention\". He would talk to me and ask me questions and touch me.\n\nHe would rub me all over and put his hands under my shirt. He would take his hands and rub and squeeze or massage my breasts under my shirt as he kinda hugged me from behind. He would feel me up and down and would go down and rub my inner thighs and private areas (over the clothes... That I remember). I remember him whispering in my ear asking if I liked it and other stuff. If I would get uncomfortable he would hush me and tell me I'd learn to like it and all kinds of very messed up (looking back) things.\n\nI remember one time I was in the living room reading on an air mattress we hadn't put away yet from family that had stayed over. He came and lay down on it next to me. I remember him hugging and touching me and whispering things. And then he basically, what I'm realizing only now, spooned me. I just remember being able to feel his hard boner against my butt and he held me and whispered more things.\n\nMost of the incidents would only end abruptly because someone was about to walk in the same room or my brother would come looking for his friend.\n\nSometimes I get really scared thinking about how far things might've gone. I think it was just luck that a lot of different circumstances kept him away from the house for a while and it eventually ended.\n\nI could get really into this because I have had so many emotions and effects because of this over the years but I'm already shaking just trying to explain all this and it's not the main focus of this post.\n\nI posted about this once in the past elsewhere and I got messages saying what I experienced was basically nothing and to get over it because other people were actually molested as a kid.

However I  have been feeling guilt and shame about oversharing personal stories  with him. He has always been kind and understanding ( or at least,  trying his best to understand) and I have always been 'troubled'. Lots  of mental health issues and past problems (sexual assault, eating  disorders, unhealthy family relationships...). I have never really  worked through these, but I find myself in a semi-good place. I still  struggle with sadness because of the fact that I have been through lots  of changes recently ( moved to a new country, fired from my job,  relapsed into disordered eating...) and I have been feeling very  irritable. I get angry and upset over small things, and I lash out at my  partner for the stupidest things. This situation is horrible for him,  and every time I feel absolutely ashamed an embarrassed of my behaviour.\n\nI  have tried to understand why I behave this way, and how to be better  for him. I realised that most of my anger comes from a place of anxious  feelings and guilt. Every time I share in too much details a story from  my past, I regret it deeply and keep that guilt for months on end. He  does not make me feel that way. He is, as I said, amazing: he listens to  me, try to confort me and is super understanding overall. But I cannot  shake the feeling that I talk too much, and that I am unloading too many  feelings on him. I feel like I am always the one with problems, past  issues, unresolved emotions, and that he is the one always ok. He says  that he does not have any problems,. and that listening to me does not  bother him,a nd that I am allowed to vent, complain and just talk about  anything that bothers me with him, and that he does the same thing with  me when he has a problem.\n\nRecently  however, I have told him a story that I am extremely ashamed of and  that I would have preferred to NEVER ever mention in my life. To give a  little context, this story involves a one time abusive behaviour between  my parents. It sounds bad, but this was a one time thing. It was a  moment in time where a lot of different factors were at play, and  although it does not justify anything, it explains it. My parents have  always loved each other, they have been loving, caring and never did  they have any kind of abusive behaviour except for that one time. I know  it because I was there. They had their flaws, big ones, but they loved  us and were normal parents. They did not abuse me, but messed me up in  certain ways, which made me kind of resentful towards them.\n\nSo  I am venting about my mother and I am completely wasted, and I start  ranting about my parents, and he pushed me to tell him more. I tell him  in one sentence. No more explanation or anything else. I wake up, and I  feel horrible. He shouldn't have known this, I am so ashamed and  embarrassed, and especially I feel like shit. My father passed away 5  years ago, and me telling this story makes me feel like I dishonored  him, his memory, and that my family deserves better. And now my  boyfriend has a whole other fucked up image of my family, which is not  true, I just feel like shit.\n\nThis  happened 3 months ago. And still, now I feel guilty and embarrassed  about this story in particular, but every other personal story I shared  with him adds to this feeling. So I am constantly angry and I get upset  at him over stupid things, and I don't know how to stop being this way. I  am tired of feeling like shit, and I am really scared of messing up my  relationship, any advice is welcome!\n\nTL;DR  : Couple months ago, I shared unwillingly a personal story with my  boyfriend, which made me feel like shit. All personal stories that I  shared with him before that add to this feeling of guilt and  embarrassment, and this causes me to get angry and upset over anything,  which is destroying my relationship. I don't know how to stop feeling  guilty and lashing out.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

We were together for a little over a year and there's a lot to think through. One thing really bothers me.\n\n   When I'm working, I prefer to keep my phone on silent and only check Whatsapp a couple of times a day. When we first got together, my now ex had an issue with this. I would see his texts a few hours later and even though I always replied; he felt like I wasn't giving him enough attention. We *were* in a committed relationship and I wanted to make him happy so I made myself more available to him. He then wanted me to keep my sound on at night as well and would get angry if I wanted to go to bed before him. I caved. Of course it escalated. He was now asking me to not text anyone else while he was texting me. That's where I finally drew the line and went back to my old ways. If he wanted to send me angry texts in the middle of night, he had to wait until I woke up for a reply. He started acting like such a child then. Couldn't accept that my number one purpose in life wasn't to bend to his every whim. After that he became so cold to me. When I texted him, he wouldn't reply. When we met up, he wouldn't want to talk to me. We would have sex, cuddle for a long time afterwards but nothing else. One time I was trying to talk to him about where our relationship was going and he got so mad that he ran out of his flat and into the apartment building half naked. One night after a bit of drinking I got really emotional and started firing texts at him while crying my eyes out. I told him if he cared about me as he claimed, he wouldn't keep me at a distance. I told him I loved him and would do anything to get close like we used to be. I told him he didn't deserve my love. It was quite dramatic really but it needed to be said. He of course didn't reply. After that it still took me a long time to accept that I had to leave him. When I finally got to that point, he noticed. He became angrier and more volatile. He would criticize everything about me and when I started crying, he would get angrier because I was \"acting like a child\" and sometimes apologize afterwards. He would always bring up that drunken night. Said I was too clingy and obsessed. Said I wanted too much from him. I honestly felt bad about that night for such a long time. I thought I was unreasonable and a bad girlfriend. But you know what? I wasn't. If he hadn't literally **demanded** more texts, more phone calls, more more more more more I wouldn't have been \"clingy\" or \"obsessed\". If I didn't give him the attention he felt entitled to, he would've called me \"cold\" or \"distant\". Nothing would've been good enough for him. \n\n   I refuse to feel bad for trying to emotionally connect with a man who said he cared about me \"more than anyone else in his life\". I refuse to feel bad for being open and vulnerable with him. I refuse to feel bad for caring about him and doing what I thought would make him happy. I won't let him make me feel bad for being who I am.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Your friendly ff22 mod here checking in with some updates and requests! Highlights are in bold.**\n\n**I added post flair, and user flair.**  Post flair was easy,  but I know that some people have to remain anonmymous or lurk on this sub, so I wasn't sure about flair for those who aren't supporters or recovered.  If you have ideas other user flair, put 'em here in the comments, I'd love to hear them!\n\nHave you noticed we have had an automod running for a couple months?  So far so good.  I have it programmed to message the mods when we get multiple reports on a comment or post. It also automatically deletes those spam links that plague our sub. **If anyone has experience programming an automoderator I would really appreciate help and advice** (I do look at r/AutoModerator as well).\n\n**Please continue to report when you see comments/users/posts it really help us keep trolls under control.** It is faster to have multiple reports than message the mods.  The auto-mod report sends us directly to the post or problem comment.  We are a small team so please be patient with us, we take breaks from modding the sub to deal with our own lives so know that we are trying our best.    \n\nI would love to have this community continue to grow and provide resources for individuals visiting and looking for guidance.  **If someone is looking for immediate help, we have resources in the side bar, encourage people to use them** as we aren't professionals ([loveisrespect.org](https://loveisrespect.org) has a 24/7 chat function available for immediate help). \n\n**To those of you that have made book recommendations, could you add them here in the comments**, I have seen some recent freqeunts and I'm always looking to expand our \"suggested reading\" tab. I think *we are lacking books that are centered on parental abuse so suggest away.*  As a reminder I'd prefer if we did not provide links providing PDFs that are pirated as comments.  \n\n**I've been cosidering seeing if we start a wiki to provide local resources for various cities.**  So that we could start a catalog that when individuals are scared to leave they can at least can see there may be resources available in their area that can help locally.  Let us know what you think. \n\n**As our community is growing and we have more visitors, please be cognizant of our rules.** We still do not encrouage PM/DM requests, the mods cannot monitor conversations outside of this sub, and I do not want it to become a place people can mine for victims.  **Continue to approach other people's pain with compassion, understanding, openness.** \n\n**We do not allow linked posts** \\- this was a decision that was made because we had a lot of spam postings of people promoting their youtube channels for their own gains.  So if I have deleted your post because it linked images or videos, it's been a hard rule to uphold in various ways.  I want everyone to feel heard so please keep that in mind when posting. I'm going to try and be more nuanced with it, so providing context helps the mods make that decision.   \n\nExample - A user posts a link to video that is a clip from show stating \"Came across this and it helped me process my feelings about my experience, here's some of my story\" as a way to share.  I'd like to keep this kind of post as opposed to a link to a video with little context or personal experience attached.  I hope that makes sense.  I'm regretting posts I've taken down in the past and trying to come up with some metric or line here. \n\n**Sometimes when things change they get changed on New Reddit and it takes me extra time to update Old Reddit.  I'm sorry if that has caused issues.** \n\n**Lastly, I've been thinking it may be nice to have some weekly posts** \\- some that I have been thinking of are what some people have done to help themselves recover (Mantra Monday), or what is something good that has happened to them this week that they have reflected on instead of focusing on their pain. Possibly a weekly \"Is This Abuse? Uncommon Signs Encountered\" \n\nAny suggestions are welcome and we'll take them into consideration. My vision would be for individuals still in abusive relationships to see some stories of success and that there's a life beyond the abuse, and those recovering after leaving are given more ways to heal, and those recovered have an opportunity to share their stories.\n\n# As always, be kind to yourself and you are worthy of real love and respect.\n\n\\-ff22", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I had no feelings left I guess, I mostly felt depressed and sad. We fought all the time. \nHe hit me one time over my eye which gave me a black eye and half cracked eyebrow. \nAfter that I just felt like shit literally all the time, didn\u2019t feel loved at all and so on. Sad all the time. And like times before, he promised to get some help. Which he didn\u2019t get, and that\u2019s why I broke up I think. \n\nIt happened many times during our years that he somehow hurt me, pushed me, destroyed my phones, iPad and glasses. \nAnd for a long time he never even wanted to do stuff with me, just sit by his computer. Always angry. Couldn\u2019t talk about feelings with him because it was boring. \n\nI broke up eventually in hope that I would get over what he had done and feel better with myself overall. I still liked him in some sort of way and told him to work on himself meanwhile, and let the future decide about us. \n\nDuring that time I slept with some guy. Twice. Can\u2019t really say why, I just know that I felt unloved and really really depressed. Made stupid choices. \n\nI told my ex because he wanted to know if I had been with somebody, at first I lied and said no, but then I admitted. And hell broke lose.\n\nHe hacked my accounts and printed my conversations with the guy I slept with, like sexual things etc. he then sent them to my closest friends and showed all his friends too. Oh, inclusive my mother and brothers. And random people I don\u2019t even know at all. \nAnd telling everyone on his work etc that I cheated on him. Everyone thinks I\u2019ve cheated now. \n\nHe also wrote stuff on his Instagram etc, sharing quotes about cheating and so on. Calling me a narcissist?? This guy just can\u2019t understand that when you try so hard for years, you finally reach a point where u feel that \u201cno this person is just being good for a few days and then back to as it use to, can\u2019t make it any longer\u201d.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve said sorry to him about what I did, I never meant to hurt him or anything. But I felt so... I can\u2019t even explain how I felt tbh. Like I had no emotions whatsoever after he hit me. I felt like a walking dead. \nBut I really really can\u2019t feel that I\u2019ve cheated? I know I have lied and all that, but we were not together. And I told him that we are able to do whatever we want with other people so I never really held him away from doing stuff either... he did get a dating app, and so did I. But I get blamed for having it because \u201cI fucked a guy, why tf did I need a dating app too\u201d\n\n\nNow I\u2019m trying to hang out with him again, and yes I know, u guys don\u2019t have to spam about it being stupid, but he switch mood in a second. \nI can\u2019t even recall how many times per day I have to hear that I\u2019m a whore, slut, worthless, disgusting, that he hates me. He sends me pictures of the guy I\u2019ve slept with!!!! And writes stuff like \n\u201cOh how did it feel getting fucked by this guy\u201d and \u201chope you get pregnant by him and gtfo\u201d. That I should fuck off, asks if I got payed when I fucked him and so on. \nHe even changed his own Instagram account! Switched profile pic into the guy I slept with, and wrote that \u201chi I\u2019m the ugly fucking retarded guy XXXXX slept with\u201d\n\nAnother problem I have is, he wants me to pay rent for the months I didn\u2019t live there \u201cbecause I just left\u201d. But all the time I REALLY lived there; he kicked me out whenever he felt for it. Like 3 times he locked me out in the middle of the night. I payed like 1.5 year rent by myself and then I got really really depressed because what he did towards me etc. so I had no money to pay with, SO he then payed for 2 years rent. I\u2019ve never complained about having to pay 1.5 year rent for him , but I constantly need to hear what he payed for me??? And now he wants money back? But he haven\u2019t even payed back my mobile, glasses and iPad. \nI did buy a new iPhone which he promises he would pay, but ended in me paying for it. Really hard tbh now that I\u2019m only working part time..\n\nNow he says that he will not demand me for the rent money \u201cwhen I didn\u2019t live there\u201d (I lived at my moms but visited him sometimes\u201d, in change that he doesn\u2019t have to pay for new glasses etc!!!!!!!!! But I can\u2019t afford to fucking buy new glasses!!! And the rest of the stuff he broke! I can\u2019t see shit without them and it\u2019s been 2 years!! I reuse 1 day- lenses so i can see anything. \n\n\nWhen he asks me why I \u201cCHEATED\u201d on him; I tell him I really don\u2019t know, because normally I never ever sleep with guys just like that. I hate ONS. But that I \u201cguess\u201d it somehow could have something to do with my well being after what he did towards me. I never thought clearly... it was like I lost my mind :( \nBut he tells me that it\u2019s a worthless excuse and that I can\u2019t say anything else than it was my choice to be a whore\n\nIs this stuff I deserve to hear? Everyday? Its been like 3 months now but I don\u2019t know how long I can stand this. I cry like 5 times a day. \nAm I such a bad person? Am I a narcissist?\nAm I disgusting? What is wrong with me?

My Dad (46M) responded to me (18M) telling him that I didn't feel safe around him as he is veebally abusive and physically threatened me multiple times with \"That hurts my feelings.\" \"That hurts my feelings.\" What the fuck kind of response is that! I told you I didn't feel safe around you and instead of saying \"oh shit, I'm sorry you felt that way.\" Or ask questions about what he did wrong, he turned it into something about him self. What kind of selfish asshole turns \"Dad I don't feel safe around you\" into \"You hurt my feelings. You're being mean.\" It always has to be about him! He always twists my words into something out of context and makes a personal attack out of it! When I recounted the times the threatened me, he tried to gaslight me into believing details that nevee happened. One time, I had an allergic reaction to laundry detergent that gave me hives. He told me that my mattress sheet was safe until he started yelling at me about why I hadn't washed it. He then told me he had been telling me all day to wash it. That asshole! Then he accused me of lying about doing all of my laundry. Which I was being honest and told him that doing an ENTIRE HOUSE'S WORTH OF LAUNDRY takes more than a day. When you're allergic to laundry detergent and you have a reaction, the entire wardobe and anything made of cloth has to go through the wash. That takes days.

Every. Single. Morning. Monday through Friday. Since I got my driver's liscense, I've gotten up at 5:00, left at 6:30, gotten to school by 7:00. Done my homework from 7-8 and then class starts at 8am. For a year and a half this has been my routine (with very few exceptions). He then got angry and said \"we need to have a come to jesus moment when you get home.\" Translation \"You are going to be invalidated to fill my narcassistic tendencies. I am going to gaslight you and make you feel like shit.\"\n\nEdit: I'm going to stay at my Mom's place tonight. I leave school after 5:15 and my mom told me to show up at 7:30. I have no access to her appartment at any other time. I calculated that I'll get home between 5:45 and 6:00. That gives me an hour of time at home. How do I avoid this argument with my dad.

We were young, in our mid-20s and just out of college. \n\nAt the time there were some yellow flags of his inconsideration and selfishness, but we had dreams and plans and I really thought they would turn into something. We wanted a home and a family, careers and financial freedom. \n\nWhat actually happened was so different. We had our first child a few months before our third anniversary. That\u2019s when everything changed. Looking back, I don\u2019t think he handled my divided attention very well. While he said he wanted a family, he wanted all of the perks with none of the work. He basically wanted me to do all of the hard work with a smile on my face so he could be a doting dad with a loving wife and everything would be amazing. \n\nWhen I didn\u2019t want to go back to work he made me and it was the beginning if the end, really. It wasn\u2019t the healthy thing for me to do. I\u2019m not saying I didn\u2019t want to work or contribute, but I was getting about 4 hours of sleep a night and I had zero help at home. He didn\u2019t care. Whenever I asked for help he would literally say \u201cno\u201d and roll over. I was so utterly alone I considered suicide at one point. I\u2019ve never even told anyone that before. But that\u2019s what this does to you - makes you feel like you have 2 options: end it or continue with a miserable existence void of hope. Fortunately those feelings always passed and a day later I would feel somewhat better. \n\nIt was supposed to be the best time of our lives and it was horrible. I don\u2019t even remember most of my son\u2019s first year because I was so sleep deprived. All I ever got from him was berated over feeding my infant in the middle of the night instead of letting him cry. No matter how many times I tried to explain myself, I was in the wrong and he knew best. Let me say that again: he, a man, felt that he knew better than the woman who grew and birthed a child and was breastfeeding that child. Just because he \u201cknew better.\u201d He had zero qualifications that made him more knowledgeable. \n\nWe really never recovered from that. When our son was just over a year I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression - I now know that was the symptoms of the emotional and mental abuse I endured since the birth of my son. I lived for years believing I was broken, that the depression and anxiety made me someone who needed to be fixed and I spent the next 15 years desperately trying to turn myself into someone I could respect - or more accurately someone that my husband would love. \n\nAll he wanted was a breeder, and I endured several miscarriages until I was able to give him a second child, a daughter this time. Sometimes I think my penance is having to deal with him and try to protect myself from his abuse for the rest of my life because I allowed him to procreate. \n\nI hung on because I did let think I had any other choice. I didn\u2019t believe I could support myself without him. I believed he was essential to my survival. I carried on as best I could, and lasted another decade after my daughter was born. \n\nWhen we celebrated our 17th wedding anniversary just 2 years ago, I really thought we were in a good place. I was happier than I had been in a long time. I felt more confident and I thought we were closer and connecting better than ever before. \n\n5 months later he left me for someone else, a woman he had known for just 1 month when we celebrated our anniversary. About a week after our anniversary he texted her that he had married the wrong woman, that she was his true love and soulmate. On Christmas day he texted her that one day she was going to be Jane Smith, as in, her first name and our last name - MY last name, the name I took when we vowed to love and honor each other forever. I remember the feeling of shock I felt rip through my body like a lightening bolt when I read those words (the other woman\u2019s former fianc\u00e9 had an old phone of hers, the one she used during that time, and when they left us for each other he shared these with me). \n\nSo here I sit, nearly 19 months post-separation, on what was supposed to be my 19th wedding anniversary. I am sitting in my house, a house I bought after we separated. On the couch next to me is my partner, a man who has taught me what love actually looks like, real unconditional love, the kind you find in a healthy relationship with someone who respects your boundaries. I am surrounded by my dogs, all of which I got post-separation because he wouldn\u2019t let me get dogs. One I got as a puppy a month after I moved into my home. The second came with my partner. The third I rescued when she needed a new home. I never thought I\u2019d be the kind of person who slept with dogs in her bed, but here I am, and I love it. \n\nWhen I got married 19 years ago I agreed to a man and a life that turned out to be lies. The man he pretends to be is not the man he really is. The man who had dreams ended up blaming me for his failures. The man who wanted kids turned on me for not being the exact type of wife and mother he expected. \n\nI wish I could end this and say that we get along better, we put our kids first and that we are one big happy family with each of our partners. That\u2019s simply not true. He uses the kids to manipulate and control me. His girl friend, who is a compulsive liar (she faked cancer to get closer to him), lives in our marital home and has simply replaced me. He literally lifted me out of my own life because I didn\u2019t instantly agree with him at all times on all subjects and dropped in someone a decade younger than him who is more agreeable and easier to control. Because that\u2019s all I was to him - a problem, a difficulty, someone to cook and clean and raise HIS children as HE saw fit, and when I didn\u2019t meet those requirement by daring to have thoughts and opinions of my own, he replaced me with the first person who showed him any kind of attention. He tore our family apart and crushed our children and told me it\u2019s my fault. \n\nI was deeply unhappy for years, but too afraid to leave him.  Subconsciously I knew he wouldn\u2019t let me go easily. It was only when he found my replacement and discarded me was I able to leave. I wish I had been strong enough to leave on my own, but honestly I couldn\u2019t justify it to myself or my kids at the time. I knew he was difficult but I didn\u2019t realize he was abusive and how deep the abuse went. Just because he never hit me doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t abuse me, but I rarely allowed myself to even consider that it was abuse, let alone allow that to be the reason to leave. \n\nI\u2019m reflective today, and I recognize how far I\u2019ve come. I started this Reddit account on the eve of my 18th wedding anniversary because I was struggling to move on. I just couldn\u2019t get over it and I didn\u2019t know why. I had to learn to find myself. I had to learn who I am now, on my own. I had to learn to be patient with myself, to trust myself, and to love myself. \n\nIt\u2019s been hard. I\u2019ve worked hard over the past year to heal deep wounds, and it\u2019s been worth it. Recently my ex asked me why I wasn\u2019t deferring to him on an issue with our kids that I used to always defer to him on. \u201cWhat\u2019s changed?\u201d he asked. I thought that was such a strange thing to ask me. What\u2019s changed? Everything. Everything has changed. I am not the woman he married, I am not the woman he left, I am not the woman who created this account a year ago. I\u2019ve changed. \n\nWhen my kids look back on this part of our lives, I hope they see the strength I possessed, that I refused to stand down from my convictions, and that I not only demanded but created the life I wanted. \n\nIn one year I will look back on today as a new beginning, a time when I finally moved on and unapologetically created the life I want to live with the people (and pups) that I love the most by my side. \n\nLastly, if you\u2019ve made it this far, I want to thank this community and other sister communities for helping me get through this past year. Knowing I\u2019m not alone and helping other people has been invaluable to me. So thank you, kind Redditors, for being amazing and strong and wise.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

That hasn't worked so well, so here I am, and here it is. My grandfather touched me inappropriately twice - once when I was 12 or 13 and once when I was in my early 30s. The first time, I was just starting to develop and because the changes in my body were suddenly a thing of interest to me I was realizing that my body could be a thing of interest to others. My cousin and I used to spend a week at our grandparents' house every summer, but that summer my cousin couldn't come. My grandparents were both creatures of habit, and Grandma would go get her hair done every other Thursday. So the Thursday of that week, my grandfather and I were left to our own devices for lunch. We had a \"treat\" and ate lunch on tray tables while watching one of the soap operas they'd always watch during his lunch hour. After we finished eating, and he was getting ready to go back to work, and told me how happy he was that I was able to come spend the week, then he hugged me. Really close. And for a really long time. I remember feeling so uncomfortable about it while I was in the middle of it, but this was my GRANDPA. The man who was universally adored by everyone in the entire family. Everybody in the entire town he lived in, really - he was a teacher and coach, and had this very easy charming way about him - he knew everybody. It couldn't be inappropriate, could it? (was the way my young mind went) It must be okay.\n\nFast forward to the time I was in my 30s. My grandfather had some heart problems and I was a cardiac nurse. He had an excellent health care team around, but, of course, I wanted to take a listen to his heart when I visited. I sat down next to him while my grandma went upstairs to get us drinks, I think, and started listening to his heart. Next thing I know his hand is squeezing my breast. Just once and just for a moment or two, but it happened. Still, it feels dream-like. Like WTF? Did that really, like REALLY happen?\n\nAnd that's it. That's what happened to me. Mild, right? But here's the thing. Like so many other women in the #metoo era, I'd pushed those two \"non\" incidents into the back of my mind because I didn't want to think about them or their ramifications. Now I'm feeling pretty fucked up about it, tbh. Like what the actual fuck is that??\n\nAnd now for the hive mind part. He died over a decade ago, so it's not like I have the opportunity to confront him. How do I deal with these feelings? I'm having a hard time thinking about him in a loving light, but like I said, he's absolutely ADORED in the family. Do I open up about what happened? I don't think I'll be believed, and I'm not sure what the goal of this confession would be, other than an attempt to unburden myself. Are there better, more productive, less destructive ways to do this?\n\nHelp, please? And thanks for hearing me.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

When someone messes with you, abuses you, is actually getting off on hurting you- don't be a Sheep. I'm not saying to lamp them in the nose but know who you are, connect with your power and resolve to stick it to them- as we all know the best way of doing that is by self-improvement. Success is the best revenge. But more than that, don't beat yourself up if you struck the narc with a few verbal blows also- no doubt they deserved it.\n\nAnother good resource for this is the article on HG Tudor's site about Empathic Supernovas (well worth a read).\n\nTake your power BACK.

I wrote about it a few times on the surviving infidelity sub. The evident narcissism is a bit unusual here as there are layers that make it as insufferable as it is complex. You see my ex is a licensed therapist and social worker. She\u2019s also been under the spell of her boss these last three years who is also a licensed therapist and social worker. Here\u2019s the even shittier kicker: Her boss, F., has been functioning as her therapist, her cousin\u2019s therapist and, possibly, her best friend\u2019s therapist for the better part of 3+ years.  \n\nLike many here, I\u2019ve gone down the rabbit hole of narcissism over the last few months with my therapist and online. Dr. Craig Malkin offers the most nuanced assessment of narcissistic tendencies in my, albeit, limited research. Still, I don\u2019t want to find a quick label to apply so I can dismiss someone out of hand. That\u2019s too easy and dogmatic. Maybe that\u2019s just me. I feel like understanding is the best remedy.  \n\n**Mortality and Those Tattered Red Flags**\n\nI met M. right as she began chemotherapy for Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma. I saw a pretty gal at a caf\u00e9 and the rest was history. We began dating three months later. It was something out of a storybook or a fairytale those first few years. Our life together was a summary of beautiful moments. It had to be. Mortality loomed over our heads. \n\nHer love for me those first few years was simply over the top. I would even tell her gently and even jokingly to slow down, that I wasn\u2019t going anywhere. Still, it felt amazing. It\u2019s only in hindsight that I recognize the precarious and impossible pedestal I stood upon in her eyes. \n\nShe could also change her mind on a dime. She would agree to something, take it back, then swear no such agreement was ever reached in the first place. At the time, I blamed myself. I must have misheard. Maybe I wasn\u2019t listening well. I needed to be better I thought. \n\nMortality made it impossible to recognize some of these red flags. Her love for me felt so complete, so pure. Redemptive even. I came from a pretty abusive upbringing and she finally felt like home to me. \n\n**The Gaslights Flickered On**\n\nA noticeable shift in M. occurred when she started her new job in the city\u2019s second-largest psych ward. She began to sing the praises of her new boss. Initially, I thought F. seemed like a good boss too.\n\nF. claimed to be from the streets and the school of hard knocks. I could relate to the latter part for sure. He worked two jobs and drove a white Bentley. He seemed to give reasonable investment advice. He wined and dined all the women under his stead on their birthdays. They\u2019d turn to him behind closed doors in his office often exiting in tears. That advice soon turned into actual therapy sessions inside and outside of work for M. and a few others. \n\nI began to sense something was off and told M. repeatedly that F. should not be functioning as her therapist. She outright denied it. In fact, M. insisted, over and over and over again, that F. was just her boss and friend and more like a sister to her. I bristled at first but finally relented. \n\nAs their relationship grew, M. wanted to spend more time with F. outside of work. I read countless essays on how to be a modern man and why it's imperative to suppress our inner caveman in such situations. Whenever I'd question her relationship with her boss, she'd insist that it was all in my head and was my issue alone. They were just friends. She was right, I thought. She works a stressful job, needs an outlet, and I\u2019m just being an insecure pill.  \n\nStill, I finally asked her to consider if she might be gaslighting me almost a year ago. I even sent her a detailed link explaining that gaslighting is not always intentional. She refused to read it. It\u2019s as though I insulted her. I actually felt terrible sending it afterward. \n\nHere are things I often said to M. in relation to gaslighting these last two years that many here might relate to:\n\n- I feel like I\u2019m walking on eggshells sometimes.\n- I don\u2019t think you hear what I\u2019m saying anymore.\n- I feel like I\u2019m just living inside your world. \n\nAfter she'd spent both a Friday and a Saturday night with him, I said that we should go see a marriage counselor. It was just too much. She argued that we'd only be going for my issues and that she has no problems with our relationship. It was the same yarn I'd heard a thousand times. It was, again, \"all in my head.\"\n\nI finally had to betray her trust. I read her diary. It was out in the open staring at me for almost a year on our bookshelf. I was floored. She was madly in love with him, fantasized about him, and considered him the most complete man she'd ever known.\n\nI was overwhelmed first by despair, then by a sad kind of vindication. I wasn't crazy. I wasn't acting like some jealous brute. My guts were right. If I betrayed her by reading her diary, she'd been betraying me for almost two years if not more. She even went to her F.\u2019s place some months ago and told him all that she felt toward him. She insists he only held her while she wept. I had to ask. We had made love just a week ago. Of course, she sent me a haphazard letter blaming me and insisting that I had ended things. So it goes in the suffocating world of narcissistic tendencies.\n\nF. now stands atop the pedestal where I once stood. Sadly, it\u2019s pretty clear he does not want a relationship with her. Her diary documents her jealousy of other women around him alongside her ardent need for him. As her former coworkers told me, \u201cF. demands a kind of worship and runs the department like a gang.\u201d They also said, \u201cM. must have really loved you for your relationship have lasted as long as it did under F.\u2019s manipulations.\u201d Did you hear that audible crack?\n\nI tried to gather information from former coworkers in the somewhat na\u00efve hope of reporting him to the State Board of Social Workers. F. and M. caught wind of this. First I was met with an explicit threat from F. via M. in a text. From there, things only grew worse. His control over her seemed typical of a cult leader. Insanely enough, I had to then deal with a domestic violence claim from M. It was absolutely nothing. I\u2019d had zero contact with her for almost two months. Even the detective said to me, \u201cI\u2019ve been there before.\u201d Still, it rattled me to the very depths of my tattered soul. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s wishful thinking on my part but I believe we\u2019d still be together and going strong if it weren\u2019t for the insidious manipulations of F. He literally changed her into a different person or, rather, he nurtured her most narcissistic tendencies from a spark into a veritable bonfire. And here I sit with nothing but the ashes of who we once were to each other. As I say way too often these days, \u201cFor the best doesn\u2019t mean it hurts any less.\u201d Thanks for reading.\n\nTL;DR: My ex's boss functioned as her therapist, manipulated her, who, in turn, gaslit me yada yada.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Who I was friendly with at work, what time I got home at night, what I wore etc. Though he always said these things with a smile so I thought it best to assume he was joking and do whatever I wanted to do. Soon enough I figured out that, no, he was very serious. So I told him straight up; \"This is who I am. If you don't like it, you should find someone you do like.\" After that he calmed down a bit.\n\nThis is the part things get a little dark. Even though I always enjoyed the time I spent with him, I often felt like I was under attack and couldn't put my finger on why. I talked to a good friend about this and she thought he might have been gaslighting me. Looking that up led me here to this subreddit. Up until reading you guy's stories I thought everything was okay. Sure my boyfriend was a difficult man but he'd lost his father at a very young age and had a difficult life after that. Sure he was extremely jealous of me all the time but his ex-wife had cheated on him and it takes a while to get over something like that. Sure he was quick to anger but he quickly calmed down too. He never physically hurt me. He wouldn't! But then he did. Just once. Just a slap on my left cheek. And he apologised profusely afterwards. But abuse is abuse, isn't it?\n\nOn a hunch I contacted his ex-wife. A couple of Facebook messages later she wanted to meet me. I won't go into detail; I'll just say I'm glad I was sitting down as I scrolled through the threatening messages the man I loved had sent to the mother of his two children. Some of them were recent too. While we were dating, he was texting his ex-wife saying she'd better take him back or it would get worse. I confronted him about it. I called him what he was; abusive. Told him this was the end of the relationship. He turned it all back on me. He said something along the lines of \"Wow you angry, vengeful bitch. How dare you talk to my ex-wife? Why are you so obsessed with me? I bet you're jealous of my ex-wife. She will always be more important than you. We will get back together soon. She loves me. Don't you dare poison her with accusations.\" Then he went on and on about how I wanted him too much, he just wanted to get back together with the woman he loved and I distracted him with my body. That was it. I walked away. Blocked him on my phone. We didn't work together anymore so I would never have to see him again. Then he messaged me from another number just to call me names. Blocked that one too.\n\nAfter I've had time to calm down, I started remembering the bad things. Like how often he would criticise me. I was both distant and wanted too much of his attention. Frigid and hyper-sexual. Too quiet and too talkative. As if he couldn't grasp that I was a human being who could act differently at different times. He would always put me in a box only to get mad at me for being in the box. I think the worst thing he's ever said to me was when I was first thinking about ending it. We were texting late at night and I told him I felt like he didn't care about me at all. He said \"That's because you don't deserve to be cared about. You should take a good look at yourself and fix whatever's broken.\" I cried so hard that night. Barely slept. The next morning he texted me as always, like nothing had happened. When I questioned him, he acted like I imagined the whole conversation. When I sent him a screencap, he told me I misunderstood him \"like always, because I'm too young.\" I'm 28 and he's 32. For fuck's sake.\n\nThis is where I need you lovely people's help. Some of you have been through similar or worse and came out the other end. How do I deal? The things he said to me echo in my head whenever I'm not busy with anything else. Even though I know most of what he said was bullshit, hell, I even have evidence for some of them. I've talked to some close friends and they've said that I'm nothing like what he makes me out to be. I can't seem to convince myself though. This whole thing really messed with my self-esteem and I don't know what to believe. Those of you who have been gaslit so much that your ex's words seemed more reliable than cold hard facts, how were you able to get your perception back and see the past as it was and not as your abuser wanted you to see it?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I told him a little about the sexual abuse and the surgeries and the deal with my father.

The bubble blowing baby himself is telling me to toughen up!

I'll try to keep it short and straight to the point, but theres a lot of info. \n\nSo I met this guy 12 years ago. We dated very briefly then broke up. He was a year older, I was a senior in high school and wasnt sure what I wanted. He seemed perfect then. We met back up in 2014/2015 and started talking. Again, he was perfect. He started a business and was everything a girl could ask for. It was bliss for months. I should have taken it as too good to be true. Then all the drama started. He started putting distance between my friends and I, or showing up wherever we were hanging out. I always did the work in the relationship. He just benefited from it. He'd do things but then wouldn't let me have my space. I found out later he was tracking my phone on his phone. He took me to bar one night \"for a date out\", except it was so he could meet another girl. The day after I confronted him, and he threw my phone and shredded my work clothes. Later that day he burned my best friends jacket and shredded or broke other items I had left at his place. I should have ran then.\n\nHe came crawling back a few weeks later. Stating he talked with his parents and admitted he was wrong, getting anger management etc etc. I reluctantly met him for dinner and things seemed to be going okay. He replaced the items he destroyed, and seemed to be putting more effort into everything. Little did I know it was just a scheme. A few weeks later another fight and he almost killed me. Followed by him getting arrested after another violent fight a week later. \n\nI later found out he had been able to hack into my phone, and was watching every text and call. He was able to get numbers off my phone of those closest to me. I was able to get a restraining order when he was arrested, but he never showed up to court for 2 years. He was still constantly threatening me outside of court. The judge knew. The judge threw out the order cause he brought in \"documents\" stating he received counseling and anger management. \n\nHe found out where I moved apartments by searching for my car in the parking lot. He found my apartment by calling my dogs names. I should mention hes a locksmith. I have suspected he has messed with my old cars brakes. I have no way to prove it, but the thought is there. \n\nHes recently texted me asking to talk. I changed my number 7 times in 2 years, and cant afford to change it again or move. I constantly block him but he makes new numbers and continues to try to get contact. I'm constantly looking over my shoulder and checking my surroundings. My therapists and drs have diagnosed me with multiple anxiety disorders since dealing with him.

(Please read if you believe you\u2019re in an abusive relationship.)", "author": "star343", "self_text": "I want to start by saying this text will have triggering details about verbal and physical abuse. Please click away if this will affect you negatively. :)\nNow...\nI\u2019ve been wanting to get this off my chest for awhile. I feel as though with everything I went through, my story deserves a platform to help other people. However, publicly just isn\u2019t the way so, everything will be anonymous; We\u2019ll refer to my abuser as Sam to keep it that way. \n\nI met Sam when I was 16. He had a girlfriend at the time, and I had a boyfriend. My former boyfriend, Sam, and his girlfriend were actually all friends. I grew very bored of my relationship and very unhappy, and had experienced a lot of cheating in it. When I reached 18 Sam and his girlfriend had been broken up, and was prepared to leave my relationship. I confined in Sam over a FaceTime call about wanting to\nleave my boyfriend. He was overly charming and put me on a pedestal. I was so flattered, I didn\u2019t really think of how the extent of his compliments were a bit extreme and a red flag. Once leaving the original relationship, Sam came over the next night. \nI should\u2019ve caught the very first red flag the following morning. We didn\u2019t do much that night, we just talked and ended up hooking up. I expected him to leave but he said he had plans to go fishing or something at 5 am with a friend, and it was already 2. He \u201cset\u201d his alarms... but no alarms went off that morning. That was his first lie. \nThe following weeks, Sam was at my house and spending the night almost every single night. I was renting a room at a family friends house, and he knew exactly how to manipulate all of us. The second the owner of the house was getting a bit bothered by how frequently he was there, Sam would do things like mow the lawn. That first month he probably only went back to his moms where he lived two or three times. Part of me wanted him to go, but he drowned me in so much praise and love paired with so much self pity about everything going on in his life that I just didn\u2019t know how to tell him to go. Next thing I knew, he was going to our fridge on his own eating things and had his own drawer. \nFast forward a bit and that family friend had to move for some personal reasons. I didn\u2019t want to move back in with my parents for some personal reasons, and he offered to let me stay with him at his moms until I found a place. Next thing I knew, he was involving me in my plans to find a place to live and I just didn\u2019t know how to say no considering he let me stay at his moms (one of my many mistakes.) A few weeks later we were living with my coworker and her boyfriend in the upstairs of their house. At this point I had loaned him $100 for court fees that he couldn\u2019t meet, paid for countless meals and countless packs of cigarettes for him. Somehow though, I felt so broken with myself and in my own life that I wasn\u2019t phased. I was use to being ran over, and he knew that his praise of me would sway me to turn a blind eye to it.\nAt this point there had been no bad arguments, I thought I was comfortable around him and that he was fond of my friends. He always acted like he loved my friends. I have a lot of older guy work friends who all view me as a little sister, and I mentioned going to Walmart for some stuff with one of them after work. He knew this guy and I were very close friends and never expressed any problem with it, but suddenly this night he snapped and I found myself apologizing while he gave me the cold shoulder. Here and there between all of this he would get mad at me for my clothes and say things like \u201cwhy would you wanna wear that?!\u201d \u201cI can see your stomach, I\u2019m not going out with you like that.\u201d \u201cDo you purposely wear jeans that show off your ass?!\u201d\nI had blocked multiple people whom I appreciated having in my life and was slowly losing touch with myself, but little did I know this was just the start of verbal abuse that would spiral to physical. \nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, our roommates hosted a party and Sam brought a friend who was suppose to stay the night in the spare bedroom upstairs. I kept my rabbits in this room and while feeding them his friend accidentally walked in without a shirt on. This is when Sam lost it. When we ended up alone, he insisted I did something sexual with his friend and demanded I explain. I tried to reassure him nicely and just go to bed, but nothing was good enough. \nEventually he had me choked down screaming at me to tell him what I allegedly did. I was so in shock and was sadly so naive and blinded that I followed him around the house as he screamed, trying to get him to calm down instead of calling the police. I repeatedly got slammed against walls, had my wrist twisted to the point my arms were covered in bruises, and it got so bad and loud his friend came out knocking on our bedroom door asking if he was hitting on me. He got quiet and insisted we were fine and waited until his friend was gone and proceeded to tell me how stupid I was for being so loud and screaming, and how my \u201ccraziness\u201d was making him look bad. He ended up insisting I took his friend home and even though I was a bit intoxicated, I was so scared and in shock that I obeyed. I was told to get him cigarettes on the way back, and his friend went into the store to get them for me because of how shaken up I was. His friend ended up accidentally taking them home with him after doing this. \nThis is when this night got even worse than I could\u2019ve imagined. It all turns a bit black, and all I can remember is being told how I was a \u201cgood for nothing, stupid girlfriend.\u201d How I was so stupid. Again and again and again, while I was sitting down cornered in our room as he repeatedly punched my chest, my arms, and my stomach. I ended up being followed with a pair of scissors and had to hide in my car.\nThe next day, he cried how I was his \u201cprincess\u201d and how he would never hurt me on purpose. How it was all because he was intoxicated, even though he had seemed reasonably sober. \nThis is where he broke me, and got me where he needed me. I was essentially a slave for whatever he wanted. He tried multiple times trick me during intercourse and force pregnancy on him because I \u201cwouldn\u2019t be able to leave him.\u201d \nHe wasn\u2019t keeping a job, I was paying all the bills except for one time that he used as leverage over me, and the controlling attitude about my clothing and friends, the name calling, pushing, and choking only worsened. Eventually he was lashing out on our roommates and he got kicked out, and of course I tagged right behind him. \nI never really understood why girls stuck with their abusers until seeing everything in the past now. I already suffer from a bipolar disorder, and this sent me probably into my worst low I\u2019ve ever had. I was so in shock and felt so betrayed, I felt like a robot. The girl that I am was no longer there, she was a ghost. I was never ever awake unless I was at work, I started drinking heavily, and I only ate enough to keep me going and ended up being about 98 pounds. \nAfter we got kicked out of my coworkers, I found us an apartment and he got his act together with a job long enough to fool me into thinking he could pay for it. Next thing I knew, it was the same thing only much much more expensive, and he never had a job except for two or three for a couple of weeks. Our wifi got cut out multiple times along with the lights, and we got close to eviction multiple times. \nAs if this wasn\u2019t enough, the pushing, bruising, and choking continued. I was constantly accused of cheating, and had my phone searched every time I fell asleep. I\u2019ve always been very into dressing up and doing my makeup, but I felt so self conscious in all of my clothes. I would wear baggy things and tank tops under everything so that he wouldn\u2019t get mad at me for my clothes. Sometimes he would catch me off guard and I could wear something I wanted to, but as soon as he thought anyone looked at me it was game over. I would get screamed at for everything, it wasn\u2019t even worth it to try and go out with friends and I lost most of my friends. During all of this he borrowed $5000 from my mom in total. \nOn top of the physical and verbal abuse, he had began doing meth \u201cupon occasion,\u201d but I still firmly believe he was doing to every time he went out with his friends, which was about 5 days out of the week. He got extremely suicidal and cut his arms to the point it made nauseous and I don\u2019t know how he didn\u2019t need stitches; this happened multiple times, multiple when I tried leaving him. The more I tried to leave him, the more overbearing he got. My whole life for the last year had been surrounded around his nightmare, that I didn\u2019t know who I was or what my life was anymore though. He\u2019d constantly threaten to break up with me during the relationship to keep me on edge and controlled. \nThe one and only time I stood up to him, he called me a whore and I felt so angry and defeated that something snapped and I spit in his face. I immediately knew I had made a big mistake and ran as fast as I could, but as soon as I got a grip on the door he slammed me hand right in it to keep me inside, and with it my whole hand turned black. \nEventually it got so bad and obvious that my best friend insisted I get him out and so did multiple other people, and in a moment of feeling so burnt out that I just wanted to end my life, I realized how much I missed having my own life. When I got the apartment, I got a puppy who he would also hit when I wasn\u2019t home and then brag about it. On Sams final night here, he slammed my puppy\u2019s paw in a door and said he wished he crushed his head, and something about seeing the dog who would hide behind me and crawl on my chest when I was being yelled at made me snap. I called my best friend and asked if she could move in ASAP and that I was making Sam leave, and even though I knew it was a huge risk, I suspected Sam would be too scared to hurt me while I had my best friend on speaker phone. I went to stay the night at my coworkers who I lived with previously, and I told my mom and everyone close to me that he was physically abusive so that people could help keep me safe in the process of getting him out of my life. A few days later I filled a police report against him, and with him knowing everyone now knew he was an abuser he left the apartment easily and began finding his next victim. I had to change all my passwords but he beat me to it and send out multiple messages with dudes telling them I wanted to hook up with them. He continued to threaten to kill himself and blew my phone up and I tried to be there for him through it, but at a certain point I snapped and decided I deserved so much more than to be there answering to him even after getting him out of my life physically. I let a guy in the group of people I was with this night answer the phone when Sam was calling repeatedly because I knew he would be afraid of conflict with someone who physically would be able to take him. \nI still felt so broken and lost for awhile, not from the loss of him but from the loss of the year of my life I missed. The friends I lost. The debt I was drowning in from him. I had crippling ptsd for a few weeks and had nightmares every night. \nA few weeks later though, I got out of town and went to the beach with my family and friend. Getting away from my place of abuse did wonders for him, I felt at peace. Safe. Like I could be myself and have the same confidence I did before. I strongly suggest taking a trip away if you\u2019re just getting out of something like this. I learned as I placed my police report that many cities have safe anonymous homes that an officer can take you to if you need safety. There are so many resources, please I beg you, just speak out. Find someone you trust when you\u2019re away from your abuser, and tell them to call the police. Don\u2019t lose a year of your life like me. If it weren\u2019t for my family, friends, and dog, I can confidently say I believe he would\u2019ve killed me. \n\nI want to also show you how beautiful life can be after abuse though. It isn\u2019t all ptsd and anxiety, although I still carry a lot of it that I\u2019m working through, it does get better. My relationship with my family grew tremendously, and the same with my friendships. I was able to rekindle some friendships I lost due to my ex, and although some are gone forever, I\u2019m thankful for that. For a few months after, I was terrified of ever letting anyone love me again. While I was at the beach I met a guy though, who over time gained over my trust to know what I went through and within some months was able to earn my trust alongside of the trust of my friends. Sometimes I do cry from having a significant other who treats me correctly, who spoils me with actions of caring instead of drowning me in empty words. It can honestly feel so overwhelming to feel a real healthy bond, but it\u2019s so relieving. I was able to nearly guarantee a promotion at my work within the next month, pay off a lot of debt, and grow back into my own skin. I now have time for my little sisters who I missed so much growing up from during that year, and although it\u2019s a process of working through the ptsd, I couldn\u2019t be happier right now. My family, friendship, love, and personal life is all at a point I couldn\u2019t be happier in this moment. It taught me how to deal with my bipolar in ways I didn\u2019t know I could. It truthfully taught me how to survive and set my own rules. \nSo please, I beg you. Don\u2019t stay like me.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He wrecked his own car and couldn\u2019t afford to get it fixed or buy a new one due to his irresponsibility and unnecessary spending. It became my responsibility to get him to work on time and pick him up when he was off \u2012 according to him. \n    \u201cI\u2019m here. Come out.\u201d I texted LoverBoy as I pulled up to Red Lobster. He walked out in his all-black uniform with a cynical twist to his face. Just by looking at him, I could tell he was in a predatory mood and would most likely target me as his prey. I sat in the car staring at the steering wheel, trying to focus my attention to the hum of my car engine running. I absentmindedly pulled my seatbelt tighter and clicked through the radio stations as a distraction. I prepared myself mentally for the exhausting car ride ahead. \n    He grabbed the passenger side door handle and yanked before I had the chance to hit the unlock button. He stared at me impatiently through the fogged window until the door clicked and unlocked, making me feel much more vulnerable than I did just a few seconds ago. He plopped down into the passenger seat and sighed loudly. \n    \u201cHow was work?\u201d I tried to lighten the mood before anything went down hill. This was probably not the best question to ask considering his bad mood was caused by his manager. He continued the conversation with a snippy attitude, cutting me off anytime I tried to be optimistic about the situation. \n    I was driving down Mount Auburn, which was extra busy during this time of day. LoverBoy continued to complain and soon shifted the focus of his anger towards me. \n    \u201cWhat were you doing while I was at work?\u201d He seemed to flip a switch in his head, completely changing his tone and energy to manipulation. \n    \u201cI stayed at home and took a nap,\u201d I replied cautiously, knowing that whatever I said he was going to try to twist my words.\n    \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you message me if you weren\u2019t doing anything? You know I have trust issues.\u201d There it was. Him twisting my words. \n    \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you want me to message you every thirty minutes of the day just to reassure you that I\u2019m not out doing anything. You were at work so you weren\u2019t going to answer anyway. I was taking a nap.\u201d Considering the amount of times I had been through conversations almost identical to this one, I should have known that catching any ounce of attitude would result badly. LoverBoy instantly blew up in flames. I could feel his hand gripping around the headrest of my seat as pieces of my hair got caught between his fingers and were pulled tighter every second, spreading tinges of pain across my scalp. \n    \u201cSo how am I supposed to know that you weren\u2019t out messing around with other boys?\u201d LoverBoy\u2019s voice grew to a shaky shout. \u201cYou know, sometimes you really are a hoe. I don\u2019t know why I even give you the time of day if you can\u2019t even be loyal.\u201d There are many different ways to identify an abusive relationship; many of the characteristics portrayed in toxic relationships are insecurity, abuse of power and control, jealousy, distrust, and demeaning comments and attitudes. (Carter)\n    My phone lit up in my lap. It was a text from my mom asking me where I was. She did not trust LoverBoy. She knew he was much different than the person he pretended to be when he was around her. \u201cWho is texting you now? Probably some guy. Let me see.\u201d LoverBoy yanked my phone out of my hand and began to pound in different numbers trying to unlock my phone. His voice grew from a low growl to a piercing scream. \u201cYou changed your password. What are you hiding, Molly?\u201d \n    I could feel my surroundings closing in on me as I prepared myself for whatever punishment I would soon receive. I tried to focus my attention to the many cars speeding by me. LoverBoy\u2019s annoyance grew stronger with every second that I kept quiet. He wanted me to answer him, but I wasn\u2019t hiding anything. I just grew tired of him invading my privacy with any chance he got. My mind spun in circles as I tried to come up with some kind of response that would calm his temper enough to have a civil conversation. Speaking to LoverBoy when he was mad was like a game of russian roulette. It was a blind guessing game. Is the bullet in the chamber? Am I safe?\n    The bullet was in the chamber. \n    \u201cDo you not hear me talking to you?!\u201d LoverBoy punched the dash, enhancing the words coming from his mouth to a terrifying roar. The way he spoke to me forced me to shut down completely. This was a bad habit of mine, as everytime he became violent or physical, I would just freeze and wait for the storm to pass. \n    LoverBoy began cursing and spitting wild accusations at me. He slammed his fist into the back of my headrest. I flinched from the impact, but tried my best to ignore his actions. He began to punch the dash multiple times in a row. Sometimes it was hard for me to tell if he was lashing out to get a reaction out of me or if he just couldn\u2019t cope with his own thoughts. He gave one last attempt to get an answer out of me by grabbing a fistfull of hair from the back of my head. He yanked with every word that came from his mouth. His grip finally loosened when I replied weakly, \u201cI\u2019m not hiding anything from you. I swear.\u201d\n    LoverBoy grabbed the portable, plastic cup holder that I let rest between the console and my seat. In a burst of anger, he smashed the cupholder to bits and pieces on my dash. Shards of plastic flew everywhere, leaving cuts on my thighs. He threw the remaining chunk of cup holder out the window, cursing wildly. Sometimes a toxic relationship can include physical behaviors without involving direct physical violence towards a victim. A relationship involving physical behaviors \u2012 such as throwing objects, kicking a wall, shaking a finger or fist at the victim, driving recklessly while the victim is in the car, or threatening to destroy objects the victim values \u2012 can be considered emotional abuse as it portrays \u201csymbolic violence\u201d (Karakurt and Silver). He slouched down into the chair, his feet on my dash and his knees pulled in close to his chest. His hands covered his face, so I could not see what he was feeling at the moment. It was normal for him to lash out in anger, then fall into a sad, regretful state.\n    \u201cAre you okay?\u201d I asked him. My eyes fell on his left hand, which was covered in tiny cuts. He was shaking in the seat next to me. There had always been something different about him and his mood swings. I don\u2019t think he ever took it upon himself to seek help when it came to his mental health because he didn\u2019t want to accept that there was something wrong with him in the first place. \n    \u201cNO. I am NOT okay.\u201d LoverBoy raised his legs and with an eruption of power, he kicked my windshield as hard as he could, shattering it completely. Everything was moving in slow motion around me. My head was all fuzzy and I couldn\u2019t think straight. All I remember is hearing LoverBoy scream and my foot slamming on the brake. The sounds around me were softly muted, being muffled by the loud ringing in my ears. I felt small pieces of glass fall into my lap. I could not focus my vision due to the state of shock I was in. The car was soon completely silent. We were parked in the middle of Mount Auburn with cars zooming past, dodging my car. I thought that I had crashed. I thought someone had hit me. I was panicking, trying to see if LoverBoy was okay. The instant he realized what had happened, he began to plead for my forgiveness. \n    \u201cMolly. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn't mean to. I didn\u2019t even think I kicked that hard. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d He was crying into his hands. I came to the realization that it was not my fault, let alone another driver. When I registered the fact that LoverBoy was the one to break my windshield, I put my car into drive and left. I did not speak the entire ride, until I came to a park where I could stop and assess the damage. I felt an overwhelming sense of attachment to my windshield. LoverBoy\u2019s anger grew like an infuriated blister until it burst open, releasing all emotions at once. Fortunately, this time the victim of his backlash was the windshield instead of me. I could relate to the windshield. I had been broken too.. many times. I had been cracked and shattered and busted. I knew how it felt to be falling apart at the seams. There are many negative effects on victims of abusive relationships that are prevalent during the relationship, but sometimes the effects may lay dormant until a later time after the relationship has ended; some of these negative effects include the development of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and in some cases substance abuse (Orzeck 168). \nLoverBoy was begging me to forgive him and continued to throw solutions at me left and right. He offered to pay for the damage. He called his uncle who did work on cars. He made up intricate stories for me to tell my parents.\n\u201cI love you, Molly. You know that.\u201d He plead for my forgiveness. I couldn\u2019t help but give a lifeless shrug. Just as it could be applied to my situation with LoverBoy, the learning theory can be applied to human behavior by examining the consequences of reinforcement and punishment; for example, people in new relationships reinforce positive behavior by doing and saying nice things for each other (Halligan). If abuse enters a relationship, it starts slowly, often in the context of positive reinforcement (Halligan). As Halligan says, \u201c...the abused is never exposed to relentless, incessant abuse but \u2018abuse every now and then.\u2019 Sprinkled in between the episodes of abuse are those of high reinforcement (e.g. apology text messages\u2012 \u2018I was drunk and didn't know what I was doing\u2019, declarations of love\u2012 \u2018You know I love you and that you are the only one for me,\u2019 and promises for the future\u2012 \u2018I promise I won't ever hit you again\u2019\u201d (Halligan). I knew that this was his way of trying to make things better. He would guilt me into feeling bad for him. He would pretend to be the victim and beg for me to bring him comfort by telling him that it was okay. \nHe did everything he possibly could to avoid my parents finding out it was he who had shattered my windshield. He knew that he would lose all contact and control he had over me. My parents had threatened many times before to keep me from seeing him, but he never took the threats seriously. Eventually, we agreed on a plan. As always, I forced myself to forgive him and move on. Unhealthy relationships have become an inevitable trap in today\u2019s society; victims of abuse have shown to stay in toxic relationships or put up with and endure the abuse, knowing that it will be followed by reinforcers, such as apologies and promises (Halligan). There is a recurring pattern in many toxic relationships. This pattern is the portrayal of emotional or physical torment, accompanied by \u2012 in an attempt to keep the victim trapped in their web of control and manipulation \u2012 efforts made to make the victim feel loved and cared for. Emotional abuse is significantly more prominent among toxic relationships than physical or sexual abuse is; emotional abuse targets the emotional and psychological spirit and well-being of a person and can include verbal assault, control, ridicule, or the use of intimate knowledge for degrading the victim (Karakurt and Silver). Physical abuse can often be the outcome of an emotionally abusive relationship that got out of hand too quickly (Karakurt and Silver).\nStaying in abusive relationships is a common theme among victims of abuse. There are many reasons why people stay in unhealthy relationships, one of the main reasons being low self-esteem which makes people believe that they do not deserve anything better than the situation they are already in (Carter). I, myself, felt that Loverboy was the love of my life. I thought he was the only person who was capable of loving me. He convinced me that I was hated by everyone but him. Psychologists have found that being in an emotionally damaging environment for too long can result in internal turmoil, leaving the victim with little to no feelings of self-worth (Orzeck 177). I felt trapped, yet in love at the same time. Leaving an abusive relationship is so much more complicated than \u201cjust leaving\u201d, which I had been blatantly told to do many times. My life had crumbled to a mere nothing right under my feet, and the only thing holding me up was the love and support that LoverBoy pretended to give me. Researchers have discovered that the reason many people stay in toxic relationships is that victims of abuse often still see certain positive traits in their abusers and believe that the abusers still possess good qualities, such as dependability and being affectionate (Nauert).\n    My emotional destruction had become a routine. I would do something \u201cwrong\u201d in LoverBoy\u2019s eyes. He would punish me, whether it be mentally, verbally, or physically. I would break down and feel as if I was falling into a million tiny pieces. Then I would forgive him and do it all over again. My biggest regret is staying with someone who had the power to make my life seem worthless and inferior to everyone else\u2019s. I regret giving someone the power to control my entire life. I regret staying in such a malign relationship for over two years. I regret letting my happiness, health, and life itself slip right through my fingers and into the palms of someone else. \n\n\f\nWorks Cited\nCarter, Sherrie. \u201cThe Hidden Health Hazards of Toxic Relationships.\u201d  Psychology Today.

{"post_id": "e1vvcm", "created_utc": 1574762222, "title": "Coping with trauma a year later", "author": "Bbenjipc", "self_text": "Hi! So basically I can\u2019t go to sleep because I\u2019m way too anxious, so I\u2019m here to write about my toxic, last relationship. It would be nice to connect with others who can relate, or to maybe get some advice on how to keep moving on, but I just wanted to get this out somewhere because I\u2019ve been having too many sleepless nights recently.\n\nIt was a little over a year ago, the beginning of my junior year. I (male), began dating my first boyfriend, who I\u2019ll call Abe. He had just moved to my school, although I met him over the summer during enrollment, as I was on student government. Abe, although physically intimidating at 6\u20195\u201d, was fairly gentle, physically. Unfortunately the same can\u2019t be said emotionally.\n\nThe relationship began with him tearing down my boundaries. He would look through my personal stuff I asked him to leave alone,  and would scoff and say \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal,\u201d when I became upset. I would tell him I was disappointed and he told me, \u201cYou should never be disappointed in your partner.\u201d He would inappropriately tickle and touch me during class, even after I repeatedly would ask him to stop. After a while I had enough of it and told him to stop with a bit more harshness in my voice, in which he proceeded to cry and tell me I was being mean. These were the first red flags.\n\nIt continued to him telling me I shouldn\u2019t show too much skin, as he would get jealous of other people looking at me. He told me who to be friends with and who to look out for, judging each one of them and pointing out their flaws to me, even though I knew these people for years, whereas he had known them for months. Every time I was with him, the conversation would be one-sided, as he would talk at me. Him talking about his struggles, or telling me how the world works, and how I must act to survive in it were his two favorites. I felt like he was a bad college professor. \n\nEventually we slept together. It was both of our first times. After that, Abe would talk about sex constantly. He would always ask me to have sex, and sometimes I would say no, as I was either busy, or just didn\u2019t feel like it. Though he wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. He would always pressure me into helping him get off, often by trying to guilt me by saying I was neglecting him.\n\nEverything reached a boiling point when he broke up with me over text, which I\u2019m thankful for, as I don\u2019t think I was mentally well enough to break up with him. He told me I was abusive as I always overreacted to things, like when he would touch me after I told him no, or when I told him I was disappointed for looking through my private stuff. I tried to defend myself and say I wasn\u2019t comfortable with him crossing my boundaries, especially in terms of him pressuring me into sex. Then he proceeded to talk about how he could tell I loved how he f\u2019ed me. \n\nAbe went on to tell me, \u201cI should have listened to what everyone else told me about you. No one likes you.\u201d I don\u2019t know who he was talking about, as I try to be nice to everyone I meet. I asked him to stop as I was beginning to have a panic attack, as I forgot to take my medicine that day. He told me that all the problems in this relationship were because of me and my depression/anxiety. I blacked out and tried to commit suicide. I was saved by my friend who drove over to my house and knocked down my door after I had been acting weird that day. \n\nAfter I got out of the hospital, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to return to school. I didn\u2019t feel safe. When I finally mustered up the courage to go back, a few of my so-called friends who I tried to confide in told me, \u201cAbe is so sweet, he wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d Or, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t want to have sex, why didn\u2019t you just say no?\u201d Which I did, too many times to count on one hand. \n\nThe gaslighting got so bad I began to think I was insane. I thought I made up all of this in my head and I was the bad guy. But then Abe texted me, a few months later, apologizing. \u201cI\u2019m not used to having relationships with boundaries,\u201d He said. He asked me if I wanted to go for a ride with him, and stupidly, I said yes. I was still convinced I had made everything up and he was a good guy, after all I had been told that so many times. \n\nWhen I got into his car at 1AM however, he decided to play a sick game where he sped at 100+ miles per hour down streets with a 25 mile p/hour limit, all the way down to downtown. I screamed that I was scared, asking him to stop. I thought I was gonna die that night. Thankfully, he just wanted the thrill of seeing me have my first panic attack in front of him. I hyperventilated so hard I almost passed out. \n\nI got out of his car once he came back around to my house. I could barely walk as I felt so weak. Thankfully, no one got hurt that night. But it scares me, knowing his sick sense of humor could have got himself, myself, and someone else killed. Like I said in the beginning, he never physically abused me, but the emotional abuse he left with me just won\u2019t go away. And I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nI still don\u2019t know if this can actually be considered abuse. After being repeatedly told that I am just overreacting, I don\u2019t know what to believe anymore.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

It has always made things feel more real of I can write it down. \n\nI was pouring my heart and soul into this letter... Until I came to start writing down the first time he raped me. I only wrote three words before I was thrown violently into the memory of the assault. I screamed for my husband, I cried in his arms for a while. This was my first flashback and since then they haven't stopped.\n\nThen, on Saturday morning my husband went out to run errands. I started my normal morning routine in the bathroom and was hurled into another flashback of the aftermath of the assault. I cried. So hard. I realized that in the seven years since the event, I have not been able to truly look at myself in the mirror. I felt like my soul left my body that day.\n\n I also realized that never got to shower after... I never got to re-claim my body after he stole it. So I showered. I let my OCD shine. I violently scrubbed every part of me, then I curled up in the bathtub and cried until my husband came home to find me. \n\nI told him everything. I told him about the flashbacks, the gory details of the event, and why he found me bawling in the shower. We both cried. \n\nIt felt so good to finally tell someone but now I feel like I'm stuck there. Like I will never stop remembering now. \n\nI understand now why I didn't let myself remember. How do you keep living after something like that?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It was a day rave and it was organised in August (bday in November). Anyway, about a year ago, I made friends with this girl at my old job. I quickly got sucked into her vortex of drama, and things became very intense between us very quickly. 2 months after meeting her, I am declared her best friend. She then got sacked, but we stayed in touch.\n\nAs time went on, more and more red flags started to appear - she got into a relationship and was fine for the first 6 months, but then as soon as he did something wrong she would break up with him, get back together with him, etc, rinse and repeat process. Throughout this whole time, I served as her rock, and she would frequently unload all her emotional drama onto me. It got to a point where I felt I was in a relationship with her boyfriend! The worst one was when he had a couple of friends who were girls over and she freaked out, drove up there, took all her stuff, gave his key back and drove back down (3 hour round trip), only to get back together with him 3 days later.\n\nWhen she went on holiday with her boyfriend, she had a massive go at me for not talking to her for a couple of days as I was busy and didn't reply to her within an hour. This is also an issue she has with her boyfriend, she would go crazy if he didn't reply to her texts for a few hours. This was one of the red flags. Another one of them was how the conversations between us were usually exclusively about her and her life and her problems. I ended up emotionally drained as a result.\n\nFor my birthday, she was supposed to be coming over and going out with me and my friends who hadn't met her yet. A few of my friends had come from quite far away and were staying for more than 1 night, so I decided that they would have bed space. Two days previously, she was saying she didn't know whether she was going to stay over as she had a friend who was out in my neck of the woods in London, so I thought great, she could come out to mine, go meet her friend and everything would be dandy. I hadn't promised anything at this point. So I communicated this with her, and she effectively said she'd expected to share a bed with me (I was going to share with my boyfriend), accused me of not wanting her there, despite me saying she was more than welcome to stay, but would have to sleep on the sofa. She started off sad and then came back really angry, and accused me of fucking her off, upsetting her, all sorts, and then decidedly said, I am not coming to your birthday anymore, send me my ticket I am going to sell it and go out with my boyfriend instead.\n\nOver time, I began suspecting that she is a narcissist, as she relies on constant validation from a variety of supplies. I decided to block her on everything following her declaration that she wasn't coming to my birthday and declared me a horrible person for daring to suggest she sleeps on a sofa. Bear in mind that she would have easily been able to get home and she lives about 20 minutes out of London. I did say this but was told that was extremely rude of me.\n\nI am now going through the motions. I decided that blocking and ghosting was the wrong way to go about ending the friendship, so I sent her an email basically outlining my reasons for not wanting to be friends, but in a nice roundabout way. She replied within minutes and said it was all my fault because I clearly didn't want her there and she doesn't want friends who don't care about her wellbeing because apparently not giving her a bed is not caring about her wellbeing. She also said I have a lot to learn and can't go round treating people like they are not wanted anywhere which absolutely was not the case!\n\nI am now quite worried because I am expecting a fallout, despite me having cut all communication. I feel like she is going to try and make my life hell and start spreading lies about me. She's only met a couple of my friends (mercifully) and my boyfriend actually ended up telling me he didn't like her at all (which is saying something cos he likes everyone).\n\nI am currently going through the motions of being angry, being worried, being a bit scared and feeling guilty as though I've done something horrible to her. \n\nDoes anyone have any kind of experience in dealing with someone like this? If so, what happened? Were you able to deal with them?\n\nAnd, am I in the wrong here? I cannot shake this guilty feeling that actually it's my fault?

I know I shouldn\u2019t, and it only reignites the pain and hurt she did to me. But it also helps validate I\u2019m glad we\u2019re thru. She keeps her page pretty locked down (smart for anyone), but occasionally something goes public. \n\nAnyway, one of the big issues we had was she didn\u2019t approve of me \u201cliking\u201d a pic of someone I ACTUALLY knew - coworker, friend, etc. And something innocent like pic of their dog, new profile pic, statement of getting a new job, etc. \u201cYou\u2019re sending a message to that girl that you\u2019re interested in her. People that post pics just want attention.\u201d - sometimes she\u2019d go off the rails with her thought process (like the argument we had where she said that LinkedIn is for lonely women looking for guys. Seriously.)\n\nBut when I would say something about numerous guys liking her pics with gifs and flames, \u201cyou\u2019re so hot\u201d, etc., many by people that she didn\u2019t actually know in person (she simply accepts friend requests from everyone, and vice versa), she would claim \u201cit\u2019s all innocent and I just ignore them.\u201d  Yeah - RIGHT. \n\nAnd when I would say she\u2019s just looking for attention (per her theory), she would obviously justify it. One time she posted a pic of her in her underwear and of course I got upset. But she would tell me how her friend posted a pic of herself in a bathing suit and people didn\u2019t freak out. Yeah, do something even worse because your friend did. And her additional counter argument for posting a pic like that would be, \u201cwell you\u2019re seeking attention by posting about your business.\u201d Of course, how silly of me. \n\nFor a long time we deactivated our accounts because the easy solution was to NOT be on social media. She always claimed how classy she was and how much she despises those attention-seeking people. Cool, I could agree with that. It\u2019s a turnoff for me. \n\nFast forward to recently, about a month ago I caught a post of a pic she posted late at night in a dress. The comments had rolled in from many. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you- can I share your bourbon?\u201d  \u201cYes, of course!\u201d She answered. Many others - with the \u201cso sexy\u201d, etc. and she loved it all. \n\nThe other day I saw another public post (that I\u2019m almost positive she did so I would either see it, or so it would garner more adoring scumbags in the world.)\n\nSexy pic in a short dress in a mirror. The tongues are wagging, the \u201cI\u2019d like you to accompany me\u201d, \u201cI love your dress, is this the one we picked out for you?\u201d Etc. And she answers almost all of them- \u201cyes, I\u2019ll go\u201d, \u201cyes, this is the dress. I also ordered the off the shoulder dress you liked - pics when it arrives!\u201d\n\nAlmost 200 likes, with literally less than 10 being women. And I\u2019m sure most of those guys are messaging her to get in her pants. \n\nSo yeah- she\u2019s straight-up narcissistic and cheap. And getting all the attention and action she can get from it. Because narcissists love the attention after all, right? I hope none of her relationships are ever meaningful and karma catches up with her soon. \n\nSure, call me jealous, but I\u2019m really just validating that I\u2019m glad we\u2019re not together. She likely did this shit while we were together (received texts from unknown numbers of \u201cI hope you\u2019re doing well\u201d, how\u2019s things?\u201d Etc.) and the messages I saw when we were on social media previously. \n\nI now know why she doesn\u2019t have any friends. She\u2019s got a couple friendly coworkers and maybe a couple acquaintances, but rarely hung out or did things with them the 2 years we were together. But she doesn\u2019t care. She wants the guys. And she\u2019ll take attention from 100 guys whether she knows them or not over 3 women she actually knows and has a friendship with. And any female that IS to be considered a friend clearly stays away from the disgusting behavior she exhibits. \n\nStay classy, babe. I feel bad for your kids.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I Guess I would just like someone to talk to", "author": "0throwaway_0_", "self_text": "Having gone through this cycle with my Partner before, I am hesitant to talk to my friends and family about this. Mostly because all of them were so hesitant with accepting that we were back together.\n\nTo cut a really long story short, J (M) is my \"high school crush.\" He is 10 years older than me but we didn't start dating until I was 20. During the first 3 years of our relationship, we experienced a lot of ups and downs, which even he admits now was emotional abusive. There was financial abuse, gaslighting and I just put up with a lot of cr\\*p.\n\nDuring this time, there began a rift through my family. My dad who had accepted him Initially, started disliking him for the way he was treating me.\n\nWe broke up in Feb 2019. It was messy. Very messy. Although without much physical evidence the police didn't/couldn't do much. I locked J out of the house that we both lived in, because having spoken to a solicitor, he had no legal right to be there (The tenancy was in my name alone). When he returned he broke in and took our daughter out of her cot and left. There was a lot of confusion about whether he had taken her without a carseat, but at the very least he and his friend initially drove off without her strapped in. During this time I remember J kicking me in order to close the car door. He, to this day flat out denies it, to the point that I am questioning myself - I am a law student, I am aware of how inaccurate memory can be - But at the time I was so sure. I did end up on the pavement.\n\nI had a non-molestation order in place from February to August 2019 based on the incident, however J had already started renting the property on the opposite side of the square. This meant that the non-molestation order was altered so that he could remain in his property.\n\nInitially he was unable to see our daughter, which he still resents me for. I had claimed a safeguarding issue based on his excessive drug (weed) use and temper.\n\nHowever he had started detoxing in January and to this day has remained clean. To the courts he remained an exemplary father figure and the judge kept giving him more time than I was comfortable with (Three days a week), and J was still fighting for 50/50.\n\nThe non-molestation order was up and J and I were expected to communicate with one another and so we started talking again. My walls didn't take long to crumble. Obviously I wanted to spend more time with my daughter. But I was falling for him again.\n\nSkip forward to a few months later, he moved back into mine. I signed a court order to say in the event of a break up we would settle on 50/50 - even with which days marked out.\n\nNow, he wants security, and wants me to put his name on the tenancy. But at the same time has been accusing me of only being with him because of our daughter and acting as though he's not sure if this is what he wants.\n\nI have one last opportunity to finish my university studies, which I decided to do before J and I got back together break. He thinks that a degree is a useless piece of paper and this has caused some upset.\n\nHe's got a lad's trip to London planned in a week or so and was talking about going to a strip club, which I don't really care about. He was joking around saying that he would slap one of the lady's bums - trying to get a rise out of me and suddenly the joke turned on to me cheating on him while he was away and having a gang bang!? Which I was quite frankly offended and quite pissed off with - I guess he got the rise he was looking for. He then went on to moan about some of the boys I had been messaging on Tinder (who i haven't spoken to since before J and I started seeing each other) it was completely when we were on our 6month break. (He slept with at least 2 people in that time, whereas I hadn't slept with anyone).\n\nHe then accused me of being defensive and started playing as though he was a detective uncovering my lie. It was kind of bizarre because I have nothing to hide and still have no idea if he really thinks I would cheat on him or if he thinks I have been messaging anyone else.\n\nAfter this incident, I took myself out of the situation for a shower, i sat upstairs for 10 mins before Dinner was ready and I could hear J saying to our little girl that Mummy was mad with him and that Mummy is in a mood.\n\nTo make things even more complicated I am pregnant again. I am also in debt again.\n\nHis family are over the moon that we are back together. My family are not happy at all.\n\nThis, I think all started today because of something that is stressing him (us both) out.\n\nSo while we were on our break J got some speeding tickets through. J is convinced that my dad had his numberplate cloned and went through the cameras. I know this sounds really crazy, but my Dad did ask for his numberplate before J and I got back together. My brother and I have had a conversation about it and we agree that we don't think dad would have done it, but would it have crossed his mind..? Potentially. Obviously I have asked Dad and his opinion is that it was J that did it and is trying to frame him for it. Or someone else doesn't like J very much.\n\nJ is convinced that My Dad did it and is quite angry that I don't see it as clear cut as he does.\n\nHonestly I don't know. But this is driving a massive wedge between Dad and I and J and I in turn.\n\nJ keeps saying that he could legally stop our daughter going up to see her grandad(My Dad) because J is convinced My Dad bad mouths him in front of her.\n\nHe hangs the court and the court costs over my head and the fact he missed out on two months of our daughters life. He takes no responsibility for why I felt that was necessary.\n\nAnother strange thing that he did tonight was that he threw his mobile phone in the bin. I'm not sure if he retrieved it. But quite bizarre behaviour? No?\n\nWhen he gets like this, he only ever talks over me. He never listens to what I actually have to say. He also has this annoying habit of hearing half of something I'm saying, making the rest up and spouting off things that I haven't said. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's not exactly like it was before. But here I am, sat downstairs by myself because he has taken himself to bed in a mood. He was muttering up the stairs, which I think was something about me. I am not terribly upset. I am not crying. I am not hurt.\n\nI'm just confused because while it's not like it was before, I expected better than this and I just want someone to rationalise with me. Probs need therapy.. right? \n\nI don't feel like my daughter are in danger or I are in danger in any way. He has become a good Dad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIA\n\nx", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Relationship dating is about 8 months. Official is 1.5 months.\n\nI am currently going through a breakup. Apparently, I am untrustworthy for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. Because I flirted with somebody before we were in an official relationship (but dating), a whole 8 months before being official.\n2. As I don't share every conversation I have with people\n\nApparently, I put myself in that position. I can't dispute that. I fucked myself over and I will live with those consequences. This isn't where I am left doubting myself, though. I am doubting whether I am the 'good person' I always thought I was. I am left thinking I am a self-centered person and manipulative. Because of this, I am going to try and do my best to explain the whole situation, but bear in mind that if I am actually manipulative (and I am not aware I am), I may leave parts out that don't look favourably on me. I will try and avoid that, though.\n\nEvery time she complains at me, I am left defending my actions. Always. I never get a right to say anything. My feelings never apparently matter. If she feels like I am 'attacking' her, she will instantly block me on anything. I can't get a proper discussion flowing. Absolutely everything is my fault. Apparently, I have no idea how to be in a relationship. My actions of trying to reconcile are meant to be manipulative.\n\nToday, I tried to bring this up to her. She promptly blocked me and said to never contact her again. She thought I was saying something about untrustworthiness (I wasn't), and she said that I was calling her crazy and that I am a cunt and manipulative for doing that. I wasn't. I was just trying to bring up an issue where I feel my feelings were disregarded.\n\nI may be in the wrong sometimes. Today, the discussion was about the first point. She said she has shown so much love for me and gave examples. She said I clearly don't love her. I gave examples and she said 'whatever. I am done with you'. Like, maybe I haven't treated her the way I thought I was? I have always been there when she needed money. Surprised her with things. Supported her through stuff. Changed my whole behaviour to suit her. Yet, apparently i can't give these as examples?\n\nA few months back, her ex contacted her and she said 'he said he wants to mount me', then she chased me around the house screaming 'mount' 'mount' 'mount. My ex wants to mount me'. She said that she did it as a joke to try and make me angry and jealous. I said I hated it. She said that I was in the wrong for hating it. It was just funny. Although, if I did this to her, she would definitely not be around me at all.\n\nIf she shuts down, that is fine. She wants quiet. If I shut down, then I am in the wrong and get 'bullied' for being quiet and how I am having an impact on her. Hell, she often goes quiet for a week or so at a time. Then doesn't apologise when she returns. I mean, recently, she called for the first time in 3-days and said \"why are you speaking to me like a normal person and not somebody you love?\". I didn't even realise I was. It had just been ages since we had spoken, and I was trying to ease back into the conversation to not trigger her PTSD.\n\nI am really left doubting whether any of my feelings were real. I really do feel like I love and care for her. I do. I always have done. I don't feel that I am manipulative. Maybe untrustworthy (but, I think she blew this out of proportion), but I always feel like I have been a good person to her. Clearly, I haven't.\n\nA lot of the time I don't even realise I am a terrible person. I just get told, and I accept it and start defending absolutely everything.\n\nI am so confused, and now I am in a position where if I can't realise I am terrible, then I should just shut myself off from the world.\n\nTL;DR: Is there something I am not seeing here? Am I really an awful person?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We lived together, and like usual, it seemed like everything was going smooth, that we were both happy. Im a university student, and she is a CPA. Days prior we were sitting on our couch drawing floor plans talking about the trip we were about to leave on in 12 days. 3 weeks prior she wrote me the sweetest letter about all the things she \u2018loved\u2019 about me. She came home from visiting a friend the evening prior, she seemed normal, was super happy about the book she found her sister for her birthday, and showed me pictures of her friends baby. Only difference is she left our bed around 3 am because she wasn\u2019t feeling well and couldn\u2019t sleep. I didn\u2019t think anything of it at the time because I had to work in the morning and she was a bad sleeper anyway. The morning went normal, I went to work. She picked me up, and we talked about our trip. We walked in our apartment and she said we need to talk. According to her she was not happy anymore, she didn\u2019t love me, and that she had a suitcase packed and was going to stay with her parents. \u201cThe spark was gone\u201d. I still don\u2019t get it. Looking back on it I guess I see the big narc tendency flags... she knows she is manipulative, and bragged about it. She continues to go about her life, the same introverted ways, but of course amazing at adapting to situations. She is a smart woman, but, thinks she is the cream of the crop, that obviously, everyone is below her. So she went to her parents. I quit my job, tried to cancel as many hotels and air b&amp;bs as I could, changed my ticket, and flew back home for the rest of the summer. We had to keep contact because we had to break our lease and work out the moving logistics. Before she walked out the door she kissed me, then told me to be more selfish. It still sticks with me. The thing is her family and I still keep in contact, they thought I would be their daughter-in-law one day. They like me a lot, and I like them too, but of course, she is their daughter, her family. After a month back at home I flew back to our place and arrived to a fully packed apartment, boxes labelled and all. She did her best to avoid me. She also completely changed from the sweet, caring human I thought I knew, to someone cold. She came and helped me move, her mom tagged along. Her mom squeezed me goodbye and told me to keep in touch, my Nex hugged me and said take care, that we will talk soon. I have been ghosted. It hurts. I try to tell myself to follow her advice, to be selfish in the sense I take care of me. But, a part of me craves a reply. Craves some sort of closure. I know I will never get that, but... ohhh the manipulation of a narcissist. I think a part of me still loves her, but every fibre in my body does not like her. Her family tells me she can\u2019t even formulate a proper reason for the action, but we all know, they can never be happy, that to them, it\u2019s all just a game of supply. Surprisingly, my high-school sweetheart and I reconnected after 6 years of nothing, she happens to be in the same boat as me, except, she married her N. Having her to talk too has been helpful, feelings have developed. My Nex\u2019s voice still haunts my head, my mind. I deserve better, we all do. Yet, I can\u2019t seem to escape the feeling of needing closure, even though I know she gets enjoyment from being a ghost.

I did all of it, and I did think many times that maybe I am the narcissist one.

All of this can make you forget, or put aside, the bad stuff for a while and trick you to break NC. Don't do it!

My N Ex and I are both business owners. We both have a consignment contract with a store out of state.  \n\nWhile we were together we made several trips there together to drop off inventory, etc.  \n\nNow also something that matters here...  I have a medical condition that makes driving impossible.  No, it can't be fixed.  I have pretty much learned to function without being able to drive.  Because of this, I came to rely on him a lot for business-related transportation.   He swears that this isn't going to change and that our professional relationship will stay the same.  He says he still wants to help me out in this regard.  (Probably because he knows it will make him look bad in our professional circle if e doesn't, but whatever.  At least he is still willing to help me out.)  \n\nSo he had been talking about going to this store we consign at on Black Friday.  I asked if I could come with him.  Up until last night, the answer was maybe (but he also wasn't sure if he was going or not.)  Now he knows for sure he is going... and now I'm suddenly not allowed to go.  Of course, he has a ton of reasons.  \"The store will be busy.  There won't be room for him.  I'm not willing to engage customers and help sell (I don't know where he is getting this one... engaging customers and helping sell was the whole reason I wanted to go in the first place.)  Or, he wants to be there to push his own inventory and discourage people from buying mine.  He's talking about how the store is going to be so busy there won't be any room for me there.  But yet he is saying they are going to have a whole table set up for him to do his craft in front of everyone so customers can see him and interact with him (he's a leatherworker.)  So there's room for that but no room for me to be in the store?  Ok then.  He is just going to suck up all that attention too.  I can just see it now.  \n\nHe probably just wants to use this as an opportunity to badmouth me to the owners and/or hit on female customers and me being there might cramp his style.   He already did something that made me look really bad to the owners while we were still together.  I thought about messaging the owner and being like, \"Hey, I would love to come up on Black Friday and hang out, but he has made it very clear I'm not wanted there.  SO I hope you guys sell a lot.\"  But that will just make me look even worse in their eyes and he will milk that for all it's worth.  \"See, I told you she's crazy.\" etc.  \n\nIt would be no skin off his back.  He's going there anyway.  I just don't get why me going too is such a huge problem.  Last night as he was texting me this list of reasons why me going is such a horrible idea... I was rebutting in a completely civil way.  And he was like, \"Well clearly you are just beyond reasonable communication right now so I am going to end this conversation.

I was physically and emotionally abused as a child/teen and that was my defense mechanism with my dad. Just shutting down, no emotion, not words, just me and blankness. \n\nWhen I would shut down, my Narc boyfriend wouldn\u2019t know what to do, he would try to provoke me until he would see I wasn\u2019t going to engage and then he would complain that I\u2019m so uncaring and unloving LOL! He would eventually stop. And he NEVER kept the dramatics up as long or as often as he does now.\n\nNow I know WHY he is worse. When we broke up, I went to intense therapy to address issues from my childhood and it was actually a goal for me to become more open with my emotions and not shut down! (My Narc boyfriend manipulated me into believing I was unloving and had no emotions so I tried to fix it in therapy) well therapy helped me stop shutting down and dealing with things in the moment... and now that I shut down less often, my boyfriend sees it as open season with the manipulation, and attacking my character.\n\nSo I learned I\u2019m not crazy, I\u2019m not abnormal, I\u2019m not unloving, I just know how to shut out things that are not conducive to my mental health.

I confronted my abuser...", "author": "BitterSweetRemedy9", "self_text": " \n\nI've  had what I can only describe as Stockholm's Syndrome in past abusive  relationships, maybe that is what is going on here(see my previous posts for context)? Because this person I  am with now I truly belived he was my best friend in a world that was  full of people who wanted to, tried to, and actually managed to hurt me.  I was very scared for my safety when we started dating(\"lovebombing\" is  probably more accurate of a word, or monogymus speed dating..), because  I have had a stalker from age 19 to 26/27, who at several times held a  gun to my head, and even chased me with a chainsaw(I did not know he  used to stalk me untill he told me after \"rescuing me\" from his best  friend, my torturer. With this guy I was monitored  24/7 and was afraid  for my life every awake second the last weeks, I tried to leave once,  but he found me before I got to the escape car..).. And his best friend,  was the guy who literally tortured me and raped me, sticking needles in  me when I was half-concious and tying my hands/feet/neck together so I  would pass out God knows how long, and apparently, letting his neighbour  rape me while unconcious. he livedd with part of the albanian mafia....  I almost bled to death after an incident with him, and I still have a  big mark inwards on my scull from the last time he beat me(With that  person I was afraid to leave because of his 5year old daughter, she was  scared of him, and I feared he might take it out on her, sexuallly or  physically. he also used to beat his dog in front of us both and had his  daughters mom completely fooled, so she would allow him to see his  daughter on weekends and some days in the week, even though the child  protective services had revoked his right to seee her for her safety.  None of this I knew until the last part of the \"relationship, where the  rape/torture and beatings came to be..oh, and he is a health care  professional, working with disabeled people, and even got caught two  times at work by two different collegues, sexually molestion the same  girl who cannot speak or move. first time she was barely 16..) So yeah..  none of these relationships gave me stockholm syndrome, it was another  relationship with one of my best friends growing up, an older guy who  raped me when I was 15. He is pretty deep into the criminal world to,  but he is more of the kind of guy that call the shouts for the gangs  here.. We met again after my last BIG memory loss(I woke up in hospital  not knowing my full name, my relatives or my mom's adress where I had  livedd for a long time..) and he freaking brainwashed me.. with a  little3 help from his friends.. The two first \"relationshps\" I repoprted  to the police, with a lot of fucking evidence, but the charges were  dropped..the last one I am too afraid of, since I know he played a part  in killing two of my friends..I am shaking writing this. SO, I guess,  having been throygh hell and back, I really could use a friend and I  belived my current bf when he said I could trust him and that he would  never harm me.. I also think I might have an autism-spectrum disorder,  which would explain my naivite throgh life, I guess.Current bf and me  had an argument yesterday, where I showed him this link [https://startsleeping.org/sleep-disorders/sexsomnia/](https://startsleeping.org/sleep-disorders/sexsomnia/)  and explained to him why what he did to me is not sexsomnia.. and I  made him take a multiple personality/dissociation test, where he scored  very low.. he know I might very well break this off any minute, but I  yearn for answears and I am demanding he acknowledges what he did and  own it. so tomorrow, he is going to tell his psychologist. And I have  been collecting evidence, just in case his wanting to \"own it and  acknowledge him sexually abusing me\" was, in fact, utter bullshit after  all. I am just so fucking tired of these things happening to me and no  one beliving me. So, there it is, my story of the worst stuff that  happened to me and why I think I am how I am.I was sexually abused by my  father and stepfather, also.. should probably mention that too.. so all  I want for my life forward, is to be healthy, stable,and breaking the  cycle of abuse.\n\nHope you all will find a way to move forward too Lots of love The weird, quiet girl who has had enough", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I told you how I considered calling in to a suicide hotline just to talk because I was in between therapy appointments and I wasn\u2019t permitted to talk to anyone about our relationship and how awful I felt. Instead of comforting me, you tried to one up me. It was always a contest. You told me how you had researched suicide by pills. I was horrified. Of course I went to you, comforted you. I told you what a disservice to the world it would be if you were gone. (Did you show me an ounce of that compassion? NO).\n\nLater, when I brought up how you were having suicidal ideations, you told me you weren\u2019t. You never said that. Or you didn\u2019t mean it that way. It was always my fault. I misunderstood. I misconstrued. Why did you do that? Did you just say it to get my compassion? So you didn\u2019t have to show me any in that moment? To prove that your hurt was worse than mine?\n\nSo when I went to get dinner with my aunt\u2014she was worried about me\u2014you told me I shouldn\u2019t tell her about my miscarriage or about our fighting. You said you \u201cdidn\u2019t want to worry her with those things.\u201d Fuck me and how I felt.\nYou know what? I DID TELL HER. I LIED TO YOU. You\u2019re right. Happy? I told her about MY miscarriage. It is MY story to tell, too. I told her how you made me feel worthless. How you made me feel like less than nothing. How you said I ruined your life. And everything was my fault.\n\nAfter, you were sleeping over at my apartment, when we were trying to make it work after our second breakup. She texted me late, when we were lying down. She had sent me a picture that said it made her think of me\u2014it said, \u201cevery little thing is gonna be alright.\u201d It felt so good to know someone was thinking of me. You looked at the text over my shoulder\u2014as usual. You saw what it said and questioned me. Had I told her about the miscarriage? I felt my body stiffen and my blood run cold. My breath was short. I lied. I told you no, I hadn\u2019t. You softened. Good. You hugged me closer. Told me how much you loved me and were so glad we were working things out. You couldn\u2019t wait to move in together.\n\nA few days later, we fought.\nYou said you needed space.\n\nAgain, my hopes of spending the weekend going to the flea market with you, that we always said we\u2019d do, were ruined. In all our nine months together, we probably went on just a handful of actual dates. Otherwise, we just made dinner together. And yet, you blamed me and our relationship for being broke.\n\nA couple days later, you told me you applied to a job three hours away. As you told me that, you said you didn\u2019t want to discuss it now. I never had any say in anything. You loved it that way. I told you how that felt to me\u2014you had just said days earlier that you wanted me to move in to your place by Christmas\u2014but now you applied to a job half way across the state without consulting me? Without even telling me? I brought this up to you, and your response was: \u201cWell, there\u2019s nothing saying you couldn\u2019t move too.\u201d Not even \u201cI really would like you to move with me if I do get this job.\u201d Even though that still would be shitty.

As well as the gambling, he has been verbally, emotionally, financially and a little bit physically abusive towards me, I have tried to have him removed from the apartment but I don't have a leg to stand on so I have basically been on eggshells, trying to keep to myself. \n\nHowever in the last few weeks, he finally got a job and starts Monday and has been all over me, saying he would kill himself if I left him, that I'm the only person he has in the world, that he can't wait to marry me and I can't ever leave him, he has been begging me for sex every second of everyday and I won't because I'm too depressed and just don't want to, i went to my dad's for a week to get away from him and he was calling me about 15 times a day to see what I was doing, completely refused to give me space. \n\nI'm just back now and a few moments ago, he said he is going to work on himself for us and me, like n absolute idiot, believed him for a split second, then reality set in because he said \"I Googled that you won't have sex with me and apparently that means you don't love me\", I explained to him that I am still deciding what to do with the relationship and that if we are going to work on it, I need time and he told me if I don't have sex with him, that I am a spiteful bitch and I need to move out because he wants to have sex with other women.... I just stormed out and I am in the other room now, not speaking. \n\nI know this relationship is over, as much as I love him, I absolutely hate him. So I know I need to leave and I will, but I feel so weak and dehumanised, I feel like I am nearing a breakdown and like I am trapped. He has taken every single penny from me and I have nowhere to go right now. \n\nI guess I am just looking for some reassurance that I am not going to die alone, that I am not an awful person and I guess just some advice.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

(he unfollowed me on instagram &amp; twitter too btw) we didn\u2019t text after until he messaged me the next weekend asking for sex &amp; we did it again bcos i wanted sex too so i just figured. it was pretty intimate sex which is weird since he\u2019s usually one to just do doggy but this time like i said we were really close which was different than usual. towards the end he wanted to do a certain position but i couldn\u2019t get it quite right since it was hurting me so he got frustrated &amp; told me to put my clothes on &amp; drove me back home. i lightly cried &amp; im sure he noticed but it was really subtle so idk but i know for sure he could tell i was upset. \n\nanyways that happened 2-3 days ago. he hasn\u2019t talked or apologized, nothing. he never even apologized when he left me (which he\u2019s done before) he just said it so blatantly like he didn\u2019t even care . like he didn\u2019t even stop to think how i would feel or anything. anyways he unadded me on snapchat yesterday, not blocked. &amp; we usually communicate through our numbers anyways, he probably just didn\u2019t want to see what i post or want me to see what he posts. i don\u2019t know why he doesn\u2019t just block me. my social media\u2019s are public anyways so even if he\u2019s not following me he still might see my posts. if he claims to not want me or be with me as much as he does why not block me instead of unadding me? should i go ahead &amp; block him completely to get the upper right hand? idk . feeling confused &amp; a little sad. advice? \n\nTL;DR- feeing confused about certain situation with narcissistic ex.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Today I've found out that he's in a new relationship.

We broke up last year this time, around this month. I don't love him anymore or things like this, I just want him to leave me alone because I'm tired. About two months ago a co-worker asked me if I'm Nex's ex gf and I asked why, he started laughing and then he went out of the office. I did go after him and asked him again why and he told me Nex was asking about me, if my co-worker knows me. I started panicking and crying, I told him that I don't want him into my life, I want to be left alone and I'll change my number again. He hugged me and reassured me that he's not gonna tell Nex anything about me. I knew it was a lie, I knew he's gonna tell him about my reaction. Today my co-worker (now ex co-worker because I don't work at that office anymore, I've left that place last week) called me to see if I still have the same number. I didn't answer but I've texted him \"hello. you called me, can I help you?\" and he responded \"by mistake. I'm sorry\" but I knew this was a lie too. After an hour my Nex texted me \"hey.

It\u2019s hard to discern if I\u2019m just paranoid OR if I have an uncanny attraction to actual sociopaths. \n\nDetails: \n\nMatched with this guy on dating app and he immediately asked me out. Took this as a good sign - I hate convos that go no where. \n\nPrior to our date we were texting almost constantly. Even over texts he seemed smart! fun! interesting! spontaneous! I consider myself a very \u201cdown for anything\u201d kind of person. We were chatting about upcoming trips and I mentioned a holiday party I was attending in another city (essentially a weekend trip - requires flight). I jokingly said \u201cLMK if you want to come!\u201d and the next thing I know HE HAD BOOKED the trip \u2014 insisted on paying for me. \n\nThough things were going well, we had not even met, But  I am impulsive and love a good story, so I was all for it. \n\nBy the first date I felt like I knew him, and the date he planned? Amazing! An easy dinner and concert after. Convo was easy, affection felt natural. \n\nAfter date we were both like... buzzed on how well it went and super complimentary towards each other. He went on and on about how pretty and fun I am. \n\nI told him I was planning a baby shower for a friend and he got really excited and wanted to help (he does \u201cevents\u201d for work). We talked about what I wanted the shower to be like and he \u201ctook care\u201d of some of the expensive elements. I don\u2019t know if he got a deal through connections or what but... whoa. Extreme generous. \n\nA few days later we had dinner \u2014 it went so well and when he left I was astounded by my warm fuzzy feelings. He expressed the same. \n\nDuring a subsequent text convo I shared something personal with him and joked that I understood if he wanted to leave. His response - \u201cno way I\u2019m leaving you. If I\u2019m honest, I fell hard... immediately.\u201d We have met 2xs. \n\nThe problem is, I kind of feel the same, as crazy as it freaking sounds. \n\nOf course all of my friends are way more rational than me and their red flag alerts are sounding off. No man in their right man does this kind of stuff... it shows a complete lack of having realistic boundaries. \n\nSome other red flags? He used to be married and his ex wife HATES him. I don\u2019t know her but I know she drug him through it during their divorce. He kind of glazed over that he cheated on her before they were even engaged but he thought they had worked through it. He says the reason they ended was that he got depressed and she resented him. (Note: guys making themselves out to be victims in these situations Always gives me pause). \n\nAdditionally \u2014 I love compliments but he\u2019s literally like \u201cI love your handwriting I love your voice I love your gmail picture\u201d and... y\u2019all I\u2019m just not that great. \n\nHe also is including me on future plans, a lot. Part of me loves it! Part of me is like this man is going to crush my soul. \n\nHe also reached out to my friend who he doesn\u2019t know Re: Holiday party to see what hotels are nearby. \n\nY\u2019all are these red flags or did I meet Prince Charming? It\u2019s hard for me to trust my gut because in the past I did and I ended up with a PSYCHO. \n\nWhat are the odds I met TWO fucking sociopaths that love bombed me?

Then he hugged me and said, \u201cThanks, I needed that.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what that was all about. I figured he wouldn\u2019t do it again because he\u2019s a friend. My friend was just laughing. Suddenly she wasn\u2019t creeped out by him. Maybe because he quit showing interest in her, and she figured he wouldn\u2019t be weird to a coworker.\n\nShe decided to leave and went to the bathroom first. When she was in the bathroom, we ended up kissing, but then he assaulted me again, but in a much more violent and scary way. I said, \u201cWhat the fuck??? Don\u2019t do that again!\u201d I decided to just suppress that, and when she came back I only told her about the kiss. She decided we just be about to hookup. I don\u2019t know why she thought that because I was intoxicated, and I don\u2019t combine that with sex. She handed me a drink, which I assumed was water, but turned out to be alcohol. I spat it out and said, \u201cIt\u2019s alcohol!\u201d She said, \u201cYeah, you\u2019ll need it!\u201d I thought that sounded really creepy and date-rapey, and I set the glass down. I didn\u2019t know what to do. I couldn\u2019t process what was happening and why she wasn\u2019t picking up on my apprehension, or why she wasn\u2019t questioning everything up till then.\n\nAfter she left, I told him I couldn\u2019t understand why he was acting like this. He then made a gross sexual request, which I immediately declined. I then tried to leave, but he ran to the door to stop me. At this point, he switched to a different language and wouldn\u2019t speak English even if I told him to. He then started to kiss me again, which I didn\u2019t want or expect, and then assaulted me again and I thought he was going to kill me. He acted completely psychotic. I freaked out and fought him off of me. I managed to escape and got home. I texted a few friends about it, in shock, including that friend. She didn\u2019t seem to understand that I was scared and had just been assaulted (I didn\u2019t tell her many details), and she said, \u201cI hope you two can work things out after this.\u201d I thought, wow, you\u2019re being very dismissive and unsupportive now.\n\nI ended up going to the cops. She wouldn\u2019t come with me because she was going to a house party, so I went alone. The other friends I\u2019d texted weren\u2019t in town but would\u2019ve actually come with me. Everything went well with the cops. They were very supportive and when I talked about how confused I was, and how he was speaking a different language the whole time, they said, \u201cHe might not be right in the head.\u201d I also went to HR and he was fired. He also plead guilty so there wasn\u2019t a trial. There were actually a lot of red flags about him in hindsight, but you\u2019d think a coworker wouldn\u2019t randomly attack you. Seems like a reasonable assumption... Anyway, I don\u2019t feel as much anger about him these days.\n\n**MY SPECIFIC ISSUES WITH HER**\n\nRegarding her, the day after I went to the cops, I met up with her and gave her more details. She realized the severity of the situation and said, \u201cYeah, I wasn\u2019t impressed with him.\u201d I thought, Yet you decided to leave me with him? I didn\u2019t say it though. She did say at one point, \u201cI just feel bad it happened.\u201d I interpreted that as guilt, especially considering her tone. I didn\u2019t want to blame her for his insanity, and told her, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. This is on him.\u201d I don\u2019t remember what she said after. The cops did talk to her too but I didn\u2019t ask what she told them. I assumed she\u2019d say what she saw. When they called her, she freaked out and called me. I told her to calm down and that she can handle a brief conversation with them. I spent much longer with them.\n\nShe wanted to hang out with me more often after that night. She said we should do something fun. I think she was trying to be supportive. When I finally found a good therapist, my therapist mentioned that this trauma has another layer: my friend abandoning me. I said, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t want to blame her for that!\u201d But then I started thinking about it more, and remembered how she was originally creeped out by him, and how dismissive she was when I texted her that night. And also how she didn\u2019t even come with me to the cops. So then I started texting her to understand what her thought process was when I reached out to her then. I tried to not be accusatory, in case there was a trial. She said she was confused why I wanted to get away from him. I said I realized I didn\u2019t really explain what was going on. I didn\u2019t mention it was because she was not being supportive then, so there was no point opening up to her then. I mentioned how I was also shocked and confused that night. She said, \u201cIt takes time to process these things, and by the time we had it was too late.\u201d I thought, I don\u2019t know what you had to process since you were a third party who didn\u2019t know him. I was the one who knew him and was friends with him.\n\nThe next time I met up with her, she was acting very defensive. She said things like, \u201cI just thought what he was doing was playful!\u201d and, \u201cI thought you two were going to hookup!\u201d and, \u201cI thought it was a rough sex thing!\u201d and, \u201cCould you really not understand him when he spoke Spanish? You speak French.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t want that. I didn\u2019t ask for it and I kept telling him to stop. And I couldn\u2019t understand anything he said. I told him to speak English and he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d She was quiet after that. I didn\u2019t understand why she was acting like that.\n\nA few days later, I was feeling enraged (as happened with PTSD). I started texting her again but much more direct and accusatory. I asked if she ever wondered if I was in danger that night. She said that everything she saw was \u201cplayful\u201d and not violent. Then I asked her what she thought about when he slapped me hard across the face, or when he was trying to have sex with her. She didn\u2019t respond.\n\nSHE BLOCKED ME! My number, FB, Instagram. COMPLETELY BLOCKED. I was shocked. Then I freaked out a bit because I thought if it goes to trial, she might make up bullshit to undermine me in retaliation. But then I talked to my therapist, who said she might\u2019ve done it out of guilt, or she was scared. I don\u2019t know. My therapist also thought she might not be a credible witness because she\u2019s clearly a moron.\n\nBut what really bothered me was that if it had gone to trial, she would\u2019ve hurt my case. One of the charges he got was for the slap across the face that she witnessed. She could\u2019ve said, \u201cI was confused and assumed it was playful, but clearly I was wrong and I shouldn\u2019t have left.\u201d But no, what she would\u2018ve actually said would be, \u201cI just thought it was playful!\u201d So not only did she betray me and endanger me by abandoning me in the first place, but she would\u2019ve betrayed and endangered me again by undermining the criminal case. I don\u2019t know if she just didn\u2019t want to be involved or testify, and figured if she didn\u2019t see a crime, then she can\u2019t be involved. But regardless, for selfish reasons, she tried to put me in harm\u2019s way AGAIN.\n\nObviously we aren\u2019t friends anymore. I don\u2019t ever expect an apology from her. She never apologized to me before blocking me anyway. But I have a really hard time getting over this second branch of my PTSD. She re-victimized me and re-traumatized me, and faced zero consequences for it. At least he was prosecuted. She\u2019s out there, being a moron, living life carefree. I can\u2019t handle it.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nTl;dr: my \u201cfriend\u201d left me with a violent man who assaulted me in front of her, and proceeded to assault me worse after she left. She wouldn\u2019t come with me to the police, never acknowledged or apologized for leaving me with him, told the cops that she saw no crime, and then blocked me when I started actually questioning her about it. She further endangered me by undermining the criminal case (but it didn\u2019t go to trial, so that at least didn\u2019t happen).", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He was also beating her when she was pregnant with me. He is still living with his mother and he verbally abuses her almost if not every day.

I was raised by a proud woman, to know my worth and to never let someone talk to me like I'm beneath them, and I was like that. But then he came.\n\nWe started dating when we were both still in high school, very young and I thought he was the coolest person ever. He was so different than all the other boys and carried himself like no one else, but we all know that of our narcs, am I right?\n\nHe could talk like no other and me, being young and easily influencable I started to believe what he said. It made sense when *he* explained it.\nPeople would widen their eyes and call him out when he said my thighs were too fat and I needed to workout more, I would defend him with his twisted logic. I was 5 foot tall and not even 100lb probably but hey, his taste.\n\nThen it started with \"hey since you want to be more healthy, you can't really control yourself around sweets so why don't I manage that for you?\" and I accept that, even was happy he offered to be \"helpful\"\nThen, every time he was overbearing and I called it out he got pissed.\n\"don't use that much oil, it's all calories\" \"don't put any butter in there!\" even though the shit he wanted to cook always was half burnt bc of the dry heat.

We have a very similar tattoo on the same place on our bodies, for example.  \n\nMy N ex also compared me to J a few times.  He told me multiple times that he was in love with her.  He told me she \"shattered\" his heart.  He told me he would never feel the same about anyone again, etc.  When I asked him about 6 months into our relationship how he felt about me... he went on a ten-plus minute tangent about how he was in love with J at one point and refused to answer my question.  \n\nWell, there was this one painting that J did that I really liked and was interested in buying.  I messaged her about it but didn't hear back.  I just figured, well maybe she's busy.  Maybe someone else bought it, idk.  At some point, J was coming ver to his place to pick up some stuff he had borrowed from her.  And I said, \"Hey can you ask her about that painting?\"  He did, and then told me the painting wasn't available because she kept it for herself.  \n\nThen he started hating on J a lot and shit-talking her.  It was really weird.  He would go on and on about what a bitch she is for not wanting to be his friend anymore.  And at one point he even tried to project that onto me.  He was like, \"Oh it's so obvious you hate her, etc.\"  I told him that's ridiculous.  I would never hate someone I don't even know.  I think hate is a wasted emotion anyway.  \n\nSo tonight, I'm just scrolling through Facebook.  I see a pic of that painting... the one I wanted to buy.  And J is talking about how she finally sold it and she's so glad it found it's home, etc.  I commented on it and said, \"THis is the one I wanted to buy a while ago.  I was told it wasn't available.  Glad it found a home.\"  But I also added, \"Note, it wasn't you who told me that so I'm sure it was a misunderstanding.\"  \n\nIt's not like I get out of bed in the morning and think of ways I can make my ex look like an ass.  I just saw that tonight and thought I would say something.  Because now looking back on all the lies he told, he probably never even asked her about the damn painting.

He\u2019s 34 (M) and I\u2019m 19 (M). We hit it off really well and I seemed to have had a great connection with him and we basically started a long distance thing. He was good looking, charming, seemed loving and confident, so I was immediately drawn to him. I had plans on moving over to his city because I loved it over there and was looking to get away from my home town, and meeting him was just a bonus. Something I thought the universe was gifting me with. Anyways, fast forward - I did regular trips to come see him and eventually decided to move over after 4 months. This is when things turned upside down. The first week, I found out he slept with one of his clients from work a month prior to me moving in and us becoming official. I let go of that and decided to forgive him, and he somehow made me feel like it was my fault because I saw messages on his phone. Saying that I invaded his privacy, and that the messages I saw between him and his work client was a joke. The things he was saying that day didn\u2019t add up and he kept trying to justify the situation. He started showing more narcissistic traits after the first few weeks of living together, traits I never picked up before. I never knew what NPD was until I met this guy. I can never get over the fact that he was extremely childish, but I brushed it off as me being judgemental and not used to dating this sort of person.\n\nWe got into little fights every now and then and eventually one night when I was out with my best friend, he texted me out of nowhere telling me how upset he was due to the fact that I apparently \u201cdon\u2019t show him enough love and devotion\u201d, and asked me to come home. Which confused me because everything seemed fine before I left.\n\nI came home and spoke to him the next day and that\u2019s when I decided to leave him after a month of living with him. He made the conversation all about him and told me to isolate my best friend who I was out with. Called my friend toxic and compared them to his client, which is an entirely complete different situation. I took everything he said on board and was even thinking of isolating my friend for him. When it was my turn to talk, he completely dismissed  everything I was saying to him and didn\u2019t seem to show any emotion or care. Giving me one word responses such as \u201ccool\u201d and \u201calright\u201d, he was literally paying more attention to the tv than anything I had to say. He\u2019s sarcastically belittled me, called me names when he was drunk and would always make EVERYTHING about him.  And so I thought NOPE, I need to get away like all the articles said. After discarding him, he continued to gaslight me through text and I tried so hard not to give in. Now I\u2019m just feeling hopeless, I feel like he used my youth to his advantage. I feel like he thought I was some young, naive boy who he thought he could have control over. I sacrificed my whole life to be with him. All that time, money and effort gone to waste. I\u2019m now back in my home city, unemployed and feel the lowest I have ever felt in my life. I was going to stay and continue to live over there with my best friend, as I just landed a job, but had to give all that up because I knew I wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle the burden of living in the same area as him. I want to know others perception on this situation, it\u2019s been a month now and I can\u2019t seem to get him off my mind. I feel extremely empty and disappointed, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s next. It\u2019s going to be a journey to forget about all this :(", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It was six years, and prior to that I was in a four-year abusive relationship. I was also sexually abused by a relative as a child. I\u2019m waiting on my new insurance to kick in so I can find a therapist. \n\nA couple weeks ago I was out with friends at a bar just hanging out. I ended up talking to this guy. We hit it off, had great chemistry and ended up kissing. I brought up the idea of going somewhere else but then walked it back after I got scared and my anxiety kicked in. He was super nice and didn\u2019t at any point pressure me - even though we were both flirting heavily and being touchy with each other. Thinking back on it I think I  might have dissociated during the kiss - not sure as my anxiety was also high. I wasn\u2019t drunk so I\u2019m sure the fuzziness was not related to alcohol. He also asked me for my number and I gave it to him. \n\nI\u2019m so confused, excited and mad at myself. It was like I was torn between wanting to have a normal experience or even a fun one night stand like lots of people do, but can\u2019t relax enough to just enjoy it. I was so excited to be excited about sex. But couldn\u2019t overcome my anxiety to say and do what I wanted. I felt trapped in my head in a way. I looked him up and he was who he said he was and it made me feel ok enough about texting him to see if he was up for something casual. He never responded, which made me feel bummed out for a bit. The whole thing made me realize how mixed up I am. I also realized that had I gone through with anything I might have gotten attached too easily and it\u2019s good that he didn\u2019t respond. I also wonder if I was overly grateful because he didn\u2019t grope me, test my boundaries or pressure me to have sex.  I\u2019m not used to guys being so nice. Even now I find myself hoping he\u2019ll respond. I feel naive for being so happy about an interaction many wouldn\u2019t consider so major, and confused about how to proceed and enjoy flirting or intimacy without getting stuck in my head. I\u2019d appreciate any insights or advice from people who have worked through this. Is there a point when intimacy can be just fun and not a mental minefield? Should I just avoid flirting for now? How do I stop myself from feeling attached to any halfway decent guy who is nice to me?", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

It was supposed to be quick but I lingered on a few. I remembered his smell, his warmth, the way his eyes lit up when he was talking to me. I missed him. My stomach ached while I was going through some of the photos. One triggered a bad memory. We were at his flat chatting. He was downplaying a recent work achievement I was very proud of, saying it wasn't that big of a deal and my job wasn't that important to the company anyway and our boss only promoted me because he was trying to make a move on me. I guess after a while he was satisfied with how bad he'd made me feel so he tried to have sex with me. This was the first and only time I rejected his advances. My libido is pretty high and it takes a lot to turn me off. This had done it. I just wanted to go out and share my happiness with someone who wasn't allergic to other people's joy. I got up to find my stuff so I could head out. He grabbed my arm, pulled me down on the couch and started kissing me. When I tried to get away he grabbed both my wrists with one hand and with the other he tried to pull my pants down. Suddenly I'd forgotten all the self-defense techniques I'd learned and all I could do was to dig my nails into his hand. Luckily it hurt him enough that he let me go. I ran out.\n\nThe next day he texted me \"I still have the marks on my hand you bitch. What did you do that for?\" and we argued about it for the next few days. What had hurt him the most was me rejecting sex. \"Anyway. Good thing you left. Last time a woman pulled that shit with me, I fucked her so hard I pulled a muscle. I can't risk an injury right now. I'll see you when you've calmed down and decided to stop acting like a child.\" I was so horrified I couldn't even say anything. Just blocked him. When we ran into each other at the office, I'd give him the cold shoulder. About a month after that I'd forgotten about the incident completely and I took him back. It seems I'd forgotten a lot about the relationship that I'm remembering just now. I think I was so afraid of losing him that I brushed everything aside. Buried all the bad stuff deep in my subconscious so I always felt uncomfortable around him but didn't know why.\n\nFlash forward to this morning when I remembered that was my ex admitting to me he had raped someone and if I hadn't left then, he would've raped me too. I struggled with the idea. He had never forced me before or since. I mean he wasn't a good person by any means but rape? I had to know. Texted his ex-wife with what he'd told me. She said after the first few times she stopped fighting it. He'd told her if he didn't get what he needed at home, he'd leave. It's been three hours and I'm still reeling.

Uncontrollably cried myself to sleep, all the while contemplating suicide. I think it's messed with my self esteem too, the way I perceived myself for the longest time.

He didn't promise me a future and made that clear from the start, there was no *future faking*. I always found this bit odd given the experiences of most people here; and my experiences were largely similar to everyone's except for the future faking bit. I was the one who suggested first that I might love him (most of you have it the other way round), but I've realised that was just a consequence of love-bombing through actions and not via words.\n\nI was just reading through the subreddit and realised - for the first time? - there was actually some sort of future faking going on. Yes, he did say in definite terms that there is no future between us, but he always strongly hinted to me that he wanted some form of future or at least some high-level form of continued engagement in both his actions and words. And that just screwed my mind up, and made me really confused. Even my friend could tell he was toying with my head, although I chose to believe he could have been better (that I realised on this sub was just a veneer/mask he put on previously). I became the crazy one when I called him out for that - repeatedly, and always apologised to him after calling it out on it, because it did sounded like I was the one who wanted more when there was nothing going on. Hell - now that I think about it, is this even reactive abuse on my part or am I just being reasonable?!\n\nI realised that's why I only told him these stuff and confronted him over text - another thing that he pointed out and said was a problem with me. Truth is, I was fearful of bringing it up in person - either over the fear of losing him then, or just because I was worried he might take it negatively and get really pissed and didn't want to be around him when I tell him stuff, like how he took everything I told him about his behaviour. I just knew it somewhere in my gut, but couldn't find the words to verbalise until today.\n\nIt's just a bit crazy it took me this long to realise that.

I\u2019ve definitely made some huge progress with my self image, as I am a recovered anorexia survivor (and take much better care of my body now), but I still generally feel that I lack confidence.\n\nIn the past my insecurity has made me easier for other people to take advantage of and hurt, as it could be used against me in the form of targeted insults. It also rendered me more likely to stay with someone abusive because I thought I couldn\u2019t do better. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten entangled in two different narcissistic relationships. Both of them began amidst difficult points in my life where I reckon I was particularly vulnerable. I really thought I had learned my lesson about red flags/knowing what I deserve after the first one, but I ended up falling into another trap as my parents were getting divorced.\n\nI broke up with my second nex very recently. Perhaps some of you remember my posts. I\u2019ve felt much freer and less anxious since I stopped talking to him, but I\u2019m still dealing with some challenging residual scars from the relationship. My first nex never made any mean comments about my appearance, but this nex did, and I feel like they\u2019re getting under my skin a bit; I keep replaying them over and over again in my head.\n\nWhen he discarded me, he said that one of the reasons why he was doing so was because I am \u201ctoo dark.\u201d It shocked me because he used to tell me I was the most beautiful woman he\u2019d ever known. He started telling me that he wanted a girl with blonde/red hair and green/blue eyes because they are superior to me. He made a comment about my chest, essentially saying that he would prefer to be with a woman who has more going on up there. He told me that my ex was only with me out of sheer desperation. I am ethnically Italian and have brown hair, greenish brown eyes, and olive skin... he would always talk about Italians being lazy and dumb around me as an attempt to make me feel bad about my ethnicity. \n\nI wish I knew how to stop thinking about these things that he said. He knew that I have had problems with comparing myself to women who have different hair and eye colors to my own and  he totally capitalized on that knowledge. I told myself that I wouldn\u2019t let it hurt me but it still did somehow, probably because my self-esteem problems like to resurrect themselves when I\u2019m going through stressful times. Earlier today when I looked in the mirror I just couldn\u2019t seem to find any beauty in what I saw.\n\nOn a more positive note, today will be my second restriction-free Thanksgiving. I\u2019m going to treat myself without counting calories or limiting my food intake like I used to do, and knowing that makes me feel a little stronger.\n\nHas anybody else struggled with feeling bad about themselves after being with a narc? How did you cope with the cruel things they said to you? Do you have anything that helps you feel better on bad days?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

They asked me for my availability and I sent it to them. All of a sudden, radio silence. My first thought was what did I wrong? Even though this may have been nothing to do with me at all. It's Holiday week, maybe she's busy. Maybe they've found other candidates. Maybe the job has been postponed etc. \n\n\nAnother example:\nI hooked up with a guy 2 days ago (details if you wanna know in my history post). He told he he had a great time. told me to feel free to text him in the am and he wanted to try more the next night. Texted him he replied one and stopped replying. Again, my first thought was what did i do wrong? was I too pushy and i looked at the texts I sent him. They're normal. He told me to feel free to text him in the am, i did. I told him let me know if he wanted to meet up again later. at night, i just texted him \"u up?\" as a follow up. He didn't respond. He may have been uncomfortable with his sexuality (gay here). He may be busy with other things in his life etc. But somehow my first respond was \"what did I do wrong\"\n\n\nI notice that this has been a huge pattern in my life esp my nex after the gaslighting and lies and manipulations.

Well, im out, for good after almost 5 years and 1 amazing lil baby girl . I hated it but I\u2019ve tried EVERYTHING probably like all of you reading this today. I went to more counseling, tried couples counseling twice, different medications, listened to her promise to go to anger management counseling enough times to bring me back, but she never went, 2 years, nothing but excuses. Well, she did go to an anger management specialist once but by the second appointment there was some argument when she was on the way in and it ended up so bad that the counselor was yelling at her and then they both agreed to not see each other. Wow. My nex of course still has a bunch of other people and situations to blame for that, it was not her fault. \nOur babysitter one day told us that we had to pick her daughter up early or she would have to ride in the car with the babysitter. \nSince my nex had already told her she was not allowed in the car, she flipped out and next thing you know there\u2019s some huge argument because we have to pick her child up a few hours early, really no big deal. All my nex was doing was probably sitting around and smoking pot anyways. But it clearly crossed a boundary of her control that she thought she had over the babysitter. \nAnd of course I had to be the one to go pick our child up because she certainly couldn\u2019t do it after that horrible argument and the way she was treated! \nOur babysitter who is more of a skilled nanny and someone I respected and still respect to this day took a moment and looked at me in disbelief and said I have never had anyone in my entire life treat me so poorly as nex just did. \nWow.  And she was the second person to tell me that about my nex. So in the course of whatever huge ugly upcoming court battle is inevitable to make sure my daughter is safe I hope that these two will speak up.

I know it\u2019s hard, it took me four or five tries to get out. I think it took me about 2 1/2 years to see how bad it was, the sad part is I realized how bad it really was while she was already pregnant with our child. then I really doubled down and tried to make things work but everything was always my fault. I often remember now every day about getting yelled at, every day, and how nice it is to go through the day without being yelled at over absolutely nothing at anytime for any reason. \n\nThat\u2019s no way to live don\u2019t live like that!\n\nSo today is Thanksgiving, and we\u2019re both living in a new place, she invited me over weeks ago for Thanksgiving because it would be nice to have a dinner she said with our child. I agree that would be amazing that\u2019s actually why I was in a relationship to have a family. But I left the relationship because it was clear that my nex was going to continue starting frivolous arguments constantly in front of our poor baby who is at this point starting to open her eyes to what was going on around her. \nThat\u2019s when I stepped out, the last argument was worse than ever because she immediately turned it around and blamed me, and said that I started the argument and I started yelling and that she was going to leave with the child. It wasn\u2019t her normal pattern of narc behavior, she baited me while I was trying to do something nice for her family and then waited till she got me to react and yell back and then immediately pointed The finger at me. That was new and that was scary and I was already Fed up, so that was it, I had seen enough and I was so tired of her yelling in front of our child for no reason. \n\nSo all of this is horrible but I\u2019m here to support all of you like you have supported me or others have supported me in the past. \n\nAnd in the middle of all this shit, and of course by the way I did not go to Thanksgiving today, I told her it was too soon and I was still emotionally recovering from our relationship. \n\nWe trade off with our daughter and every time I have her she is asking for pictures and blah blah blah narc behavior. Do I ever get pictures ? only if I ask and ask. So I Texter and I say I hope our daughter is feeling better and I hope you\u2019re having a good Thanksgiving. \n\nI didn\u2019t do anything today which is unusual for me, I didn\u2019t have a Thanksgiving I\u2019m recovering from being sick for three weeks because of the amount of stress I deal with partially from her, there is definitely something she is always doing that is negatively affecting me and I\u2019m trying to get away from her as much as possible and then I\u2019m working on getting my daughter away from her next as we establish custody rights. Well you know me the asshole that I am I had the balls to post some amazing pictures of the time that I just spent with me and our daughter. She hasn\u2019t liked one of my photos in 2 1/2 months but this photo gets liked today. \nAnd I should\u2019ve known it was coming, then the narc rage hit. I went to work today by the way because I have so much work to do. And I have her on super lockdown on my phone so I basically can ignore her as much as I want. But I see these text messages start to come through at the end of the day and I catch a couple of the words like, I\u2019m a terrible person, Thanksgiving, and then the last word I saw was financially. Ha! Yeah you want some more money. Even though I\u2019m already paying you like five or seven times with the state is going to require me to. I\u2019m doing that for our daughter right now.  and I think there was also a why can\u2019t you even reply blah blah blah.\n\nSo what\u2019s the point of this whole post?\n besides trying to encourage all of you to stand strong and recognize what\u2019s going on around you and if you are on the sub you are probably in the right place for a reason. \nWell I got a little joy out of those texts, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the twisted way that my nex would.

Fucked me up to the very core of my soul. Left permanent scars that will continue to haunt me for life. You have nothing to offer but pain. You don\u2019t know how to love anyone but yourself. Yet, I thought if I loved you hard enough, I could make you love me. That you would open your eyes up and see what a blessing you had in front of you. That you would chose me, and only me, to be yours. But it was never that simple. I was never enough for you.. don\u2019t get me wrong, I know I was more than enough. I knew that I was once-in-a-lifetime person that enters your life and loves you with all of their heart and soul, I knew I was the only person who gave you the world.. the universe.. the sun, the moon and all the stars.. I knew I was the only girl who could love every deep and dark part of your broken soul.. your shelter, your safe haven, your home.. the one that could protect your heart from the cold world, the one who wanted to make you a better man and teach you how to love\u2026 but, I was never enough for you. No matter what I did, you were to blinded to see how good you had it with me. Too blinded by chasing things that fueled your ego. I was so damn perfect for you. But, you didn\u2019t want my love. Was I too big to fit inside your tiny heart, was my unconditional love too much for you to handle? So that\u2019s why you chose to run from it? You couldn\u2019t handle the thought of someone loving you more than life itself? Was that it? Those are the questions that keep me up at night\u2026 the reason why I\u2019m drinking at 3:30 in the morning and crying my eyes out, 5 fucking years later. I thought time healed all wounds. I thought I could re-set my life and erase you from my mind. That you would be nothing but a distant and insignificant memory. I even built a brand new life, a much more peaceful and happier one, without you. I\u2019m living better than ever. But after all these years, I realized that the love I have for you is intoxicating, magical, never-ending, permanent, forever engraved into my brain, hardwired into my very existent. You left your mark, carved deep into the bottom of my heart, a place no one has access to, a place only you hold the key to. It\u2019s like everything in life is temporary, it comes and goes, the world ends and begins again in the morning, pain is replaced with happiness, tears are replaced with laughter, everything  in life is temporary, except you. You are permanent. Like the blood that flows through my veins. Damn.. the power you have over me is insane, you still control every part of me. I consider myself to be a rational person, I know right from wrong, I can make logical decisions in every aspect of my life.. except with you. With you, there is no reasoning. I can\u2019t rationalize, I lose all sense of reality. I don\u2019t care about how toxic you are to me, I still need you with every fiber of my being. Maybe that\u2019s why I put up with the hell you put me through for years. Because nothing you said or did could make me not want you. You gave me every reason to leave, but I still stayed. You didn\u2019t love me but I love you enough for both of us. Because the passion that ignited the fire in me was your very existence.. I saw the deepest and darkest parts of your broken soul and instead of running, I wanted to fix you and heal your brokenness. I don\u2019t know if I should be laughing or crying at how insane my feelings towards you are. How crazy I sound. But, you\u2019re a shitty toxic human being that doesn\u2019t deserve me. You don\u2019t deserve my love. I am too good for you, and I mean that in the most humble way possible. I was the best you will ever have, I am irreplaceable. No one will ever come close to loving you like I did. Nothing will compare to the unconditional love I gave you, not in a million lifetimes, not in a billion years. If you couldn\u2019t be happy with me, ask yourself, will you ever be happy with anything in life? If I wasn\u2019t enough for you, no one will be. I know that one day you will search for me in another person, search for the unconditional love I gave you, search for the purity and selflessness of my soul, but you will never find it. So, it\u2019s not me that lost you, but you that lost me. God, or whatever it is that rules the universe, sent a living angel to you, but you destroyed her, you destroyed me.. and you will search for me in every person you meet, but you will never find me. And I hope that haunts you, the same way you continue to haunt me\u2026.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

^^^^^). as a result, we did not bring new clothes. \n\nmy mom has emotionally (and physically at times) abused me for my entire life, and yet im still left feeling anxious about her getting angry with me. she hit me/went after me one weekend because she had hallucinations of our dog gushing blood and pus when he was not. my dad was away this weekend. i very calmly told her the dog was not gushing blood, and even wiped him down with a white towel to show her that he wasn't. i've learned to be very patient and calm with her out of fear. during all of this, my bf came by the house to have lunch with me, and she started screaming at me because i did not see the blood/pus. i left the house and did not come back until she called me screaming that the dog was dying. i drove back home to find a very anxious, but not dying, dog and my mom screaming/stomping/running in and outside screaming horrible things about me and my dad. later that weekend, my dad begged me to drop off some cash to her so that she could buy cigarettes to try to appease her/calm her down (my dad is also very much emotionally abused by her). i did not want to help my mom, but my dad explained that someone who is addicted to cigarettes can get worse if they do not have them. my bf and i drove up to the house, i go out of the car while my bf waited in the car, walked up to the stoop (she was waiting for me at the door), and then she opened the door and started talking in her low, angry voice demanding me to come inside and saying horrible things. i told her i was not going inside. when i tried handing her the cash, she tried to pull me inside and i pulled away, then she hit me in my neck. this is all on camera. later that weekend when i went back home after my dad came home, she went after me again (my dad pulled her back) after i ignored her while she continued to yell about how horrible of a person i was (which, if you haven't noticed, is nothing new to me).\n\nall of my life i made decisions hoping and praying she wouldn't get mad at me. obviously, this has done me no good because she still gets angry with me. im also terrified for my dad's life and even my own life when she does eventually get released one day (we dont know when this will be but most likely in a few weeks or months). her combination of rage, hallucinations, and her want to kill my dad is just so much to handle. frankly, i would never want to be alone w her again because she could get angry with me in the drop of a hat and physically go after me again. i lay in bed and hear the house creek and get a sinking feeling that its her coming up stairs (which is obviously not true as she is in the facility, but the fear is still there and its worsening). \n\ni blocked her/the facility's phone number after calling her on Thanksgiving to wish her a happy thanksgiving and her calling back demanding the clothes. i did this because i wanted to enjoy my thanksgiving with my family and not be guilted or fear her calling me every 10 minutes. im going today (Friday) to drop off extra clothes for her and visit, and im terrified she will be angry with me about blocking the calls. i know i shouldn't be, but i cannot ignore it. it makes me shake with anxiety.\n\nhow do i develop boundaries here? i cannot, for my own mental health, visit every single day or call her multiple times a day simply because i cannot take hearing someone talk about wanting to kill my dad/how absolutely nothing is her fault/her hallucinations. when she is talking to me about these things, i go quiet and almost zone out. internally, i get angry because she keeps saying that im quiet because im \"finally realizing how bad of a person my dad is\". in reality, i dont say anything because every thing she says is so incredibly untrue, and getting her to understand something in a logical way has never happened before. \n\ni feel sorry for her of course, but i need to be able to live my life too. i cant form every day around her set visiting hours because then i wouldn't be able to do anything after work (go out to eat, meet with friends, spend time with family, work out, watch TV, etc.). with how the visiting hours are, my schedule would be work, straight to hospital, then home to shower/eat dinner then straight to bed every single day. \n\nthe whole situation is so so so sad, but i can't control how someone else thinks. i feel guilty about complaining about how i dont want to see her every single day/call her multiple times a day because i feel like my current problems are minute compared to her's. on paper, its easy for me to see that this mindset is due to years of emotional abuse because a lot of her issues (outside of mental health) are from her own doing. \n\nhow do i stop putting so much pressure on myself here? ive never ever had boundaries with her, so how do i even start making them? ultimately, i can never help her if i lose myself to her problems/manipulation of me. im tired of feeling physically nauseous and shaking with anxiety when i get a call/have to call her, \"hear\" her coming up stairs, think about her getting released, and so much else. \n\nthank you for reading all of this. im just at a loss.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

But today my group was going to visit the building site he was working in and I was freaking out. I've been extremely emotional since the break-up and I was afraid of behaving unprofessionally. Anyway we go there and he's in the ground floor talking to some workers. Massive smile on his face when he saw me. I thought \"Uh-oh. He's gonna eat me alive.\" He comes over chatting to me like we're best buds. Complimenting my outfit, saying he'd missed seeing me around the office etc. I don't want to be weird around coworkers so I'm somewhat pleasant. Everyone's been gossiping about our break-up so whatever happens today will go around the office instantly. Suddenly he holds my hand and says \"You know the fan I gave you? Could you give it back so I can keep it with the other mementos? I want to have something to hold in my hand, look at and think of you.\" \n\nA little context: My ex keeps everything his exes have gifted him and kind of... boasts about it? Back when we were working together I asked to borrow his calculator and he said \"Be careful with it. The last person to touch it was a 1.80m tall gorgeous blonde Russian and I don't want anything to happen to it.\" The only Russian women he knows are escorts so I thought it was weird he chose that to boast about. The same happened with an ashtray, a bracelet and a couple of other things. Without asking he would say something like \"A beautiful woman gave it to me.\" or \"The poor thing that gifted me this is still in love with me.\" or \"She was a psycho but gave great gifts. Great in bed too! Crazy women always are!\" When he said stuff like that he would intently stare at me as if to see if I got... jealous? hurt? It obviously wasn't him innocently sharing a memory. He was testing me. Funnily enough if I so much as mentioned an ex from 5+ years ago he would throw a massive fit. \"Why are you always talking about other men? You know I hate it. You're so cruel.\" One time he asked if I'd ever had a threesome with two guys and when I simply answered \"Yes.\" he went off the handle. Narcissists and their double standards, eh? Anyway. Tangent over.\n\nFlash back to today: The fan he gave me was one of those cheap paper ones. I carried it around with me when the office A/C was broken and we had some cute memories with it. It broke after a while but I kept it at home because it made me smile. I threw it away after the break-up. I didn't tell him any of this of course. He would've gotten a kick out of it. Making an effort to sound casual, I said \"Oh I threw it away when it broke. It was a cheap little thing anyway. I could buy you one if you're so fond.\" He mentioned something about mementos and emotions so I retorted \"Dude it was just a random hand fan. You could buy one exactly like it in any tourist-y shop. It would make literally no difference.\" I think he got upset but honestly I was congratulating myself too hard to notice anything else. I denied him supply AND remained professional! Two birds one stone! Fuck yes.\n\n This might seem small to some but it's a big deal for me to be able to keep my composure when I've been such a mess these last few weeks. Honestly I'm so proud of myself and so thankful to you guys for sharing your stories so I could get an idea on how the narcissist's mind works.\n\nAlso: Did the narcissists in y'all's life constantly boast about their previous partners?

Even though there were often times there was nothing to smile about. I was bouncing between living with my mom one week and living with my dad the next. It was a lot, but it worked. I was never too fond of my dad due to his bipolar behaviors &amp; abusiveness. The funny thing is though... my dad has always been there for me. To this day i speak with him still. He\u2019s always cared about  his children a lot, that i will give him.\n\n (He has 3 kids. Me being the only male. All different mothers. My mother has 4. 2 girls &amp; 2 boys. All different fathers) \n\nEverything was going pretty well in life up until my 6th birthday. Just before i turned the age of 6 my mom left the state taking my 3 siblings along with her to another state without any warning. She dropped me off at my dad\u2019s which i thought was for the week, but as soon as the week ended i found out that i wouldn\u2019t be seeing her for a while. My dad who had 3 kids of his own on top of being married with 3 other step children (1 girl &amp; 2 boys) began making me hate my mom for leaving me. He\u2019d abuse the living hell out of me damn near every night. I often times look back at it as tough love, because that\u2019s all it was, but it was very excessive. To an extent it did not have to reach, as i was not a bad kid. \n\nAnyways... after a month or two of living with my dad &amp; step siblings things started feeling normal. I began adapting to the situation i was placed in. My eldest step brother helped me with a lot. I looked up to him. All that changed shortly after. My 2 brothers &amp; i slept on a bunk bed. Me &amp; the eldest slept on the bottom bunk at two different ends of the bed whilst my other step brother slept on the top bunk. It felt like any other night honestly. We all went to sleep due to us all having school in the morning. I woke up in the middle of the night because i felt someone on top of me. Sure enough it was my eldest step brother. That night &amp; many nights after for the next 4.5 years i was molested by my step brother. I had no idea what to think of it because at this day in age i knew nothing about sex nor all the different sexualities out there. It started making me feel as if i were less than a person. Less than a \u201cman\u201d because how could i let something like that happen to me? Me being a straight male i had no idea what to think. \n\nOnly talking to my mom once a month &amp; being terrified of my dad i started to escape to my grandmother\u2019s (my mother\u2019s mom) house for the weekends to get away from it. I was comfortable with my grandma, but not enough to tell her my story due to thinking i\u2019d get into trouble. About 2 years into it my grandmother up and left for the same state my mom moved to. So now... i had no one there with me. It was just me. I had no one to turn to. It was a repeat of the exact same thing that happened between me and my mom a few years back. I felt abandoned. At this point i just gave up. I learned how to survive on my own. I closed my feelings off. I stopped speaking to everyone. My dad cared about me a lot, but he only added fuel to the fire with his abusiveness. The next 2 years this continued on. \n\nSummer of 2009 rolled around and my father &amp; his wife got a divorce. I was at my mom\u2019s for the summer &amp; had just heard the news. It was one of the greatest feelings i ever felt. Knowing i wouldn\u2019t be going back home to that. Well... i moved with my dad\u2019s mother back in my home state after coming back home. Things began going back to the way they\u2019d been before it happened, but i noticed myself not wanting to make friends. Not being as talkative or open as i once was. I didn\u2019t know why though because i never had any type of thoughts about what had happened to me as a kid.\n\n2012 my dad finally allowed me to move to the state in which my mom lived in. It was a huge change. The environment &amp; the people were completely different from my home state. I once again... started feeling alone due to not knowing my mom anymore. I barely knew who she was anymore. I loved her of course, but things just weren\u2019t the same. I locked myself inside my bedroom most the time &amp; struggled to make friends. A year passed and i met my current best friend. After a while we became so close i eventually found the strength to tell him my story as it began bothering me &amp; all the memories i\u2019d suppressed started to resurface. He was very respectful, helpful, &amp; understanding about the situation. Another year passes &amp; my mom &amp; i continuously get into arguments about why she left &amp; how had she cared about me she wouldn\u2019t have left. I eventually tell her what all actually happened. She didn\u2019t believe me for a while, but she eventually thought to call my step mom &amp; step brother on the phone &amp; ask with me there. Sure enough... he confessed. At this point i had a lot of hate in my heart. I wanted to do things to him that i\u2019d rather not say out loud. I didn\u2019t know how i\u2019d ever recover. \n\nA few years later i started to take interest in exercising. I\u2019d always been a small guy, but i noticed that it really helped me mentally. It began allowing me to take back control of my mind &amp; my mentality. It allowed me to be myself &amp; feel strong. I no longer felt weak. I stuck with it. (Currently 3 years in \ud83d\ude0a) It took a while for me to stop questioning my sexuality after that situation. I\u2019d never been attracted to the same sex, but that really messed my head up. I\u2019ve since learned to open up more &amp; be more in touch with my emotions (no longer feeling \u201cgay\u201d or \u201cweak\u201d for having any type of emotion. That word was heavily used back then in the manner i said it. I apologize if i offend anyone by using it in such a way) I live my life with nothing, but love in my heart now and i could not be happier with where my life is going. It took a lot of work to get out of all of my old habits &amp; the depression i was in, but i made it out. (Still working on a few) This is not something that hangs over my head anymore. I now have control of my life. Not many people in my life know my story, but one of these days i know i will tell it. I\u2019ve overcome my demons... i pray that any one else who can relate to my story may do the same. It will be hard, but life is worth living. Some of the greatest people in life have dealt with some of the toughest things. Keep your heads high &amp; remember... you\u2019re never alone. \n\n(This is a throwaway account, but feel free to ask questions if you have any. Advice. Anything)", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

We were next door neighbors in a very small town. I had barely any friends because at that age I hadn\u2019t gone to school long enough yet to ask to play with anyone, Jane was right next door so our parents always had us play together. It was convenient and comfortable for everyone. \n\nOne day when playing together, Jane took me to a spot in my room where nobody could see us from the doorway, and asked to play a game. She called it \u201cButt and slime\u201d. She would pull my pants down and touch me, never any penetration but she would put my smaller toys on me there. I specifically remember toy food grapes and Barbie shoes. She also mentioned oral stuff but I don\u2019t remember if she actually did it. She would do it to me, but never let me touch her back. \n\nNow looking back on it, the whole name of the game points towards sexual abuse happening to Jane and her basically projecting / practicing / doing it to me too. It makes me wonder if there was someone in her family telling her this and saying it\u2019s just a game. Slime and butts makes me think anal and cum. It\u2019s very sad. \n\nThere was a different game we played that was just as inappropriate, but it was along the lines of playing \u201cdoctor\u201d but basically she was the doctor delivering my baby.  \n\nOne day I told my mom about it because I asked my mom to play the game with me. My mom quickly figured out what was going on and shut it down immediately. I never got to see Jane again, because when my mom confronted Janes family about it, they got super offended that my mom was implying that Jane must have been sexually abused considering children do that kind of stuff from learned behavior. Mom took me to the doctor to literally get my ass looked at because she suspected Jane was shoving toys up me. It was very traumatic being caught because I had no idea what the big deal was. \n\nI (now in my 20s) still know Jane, we have a lot of mutual friends and I wonder if she remembers anything. There\u2019s part of me that desperately wants to reach out and ask if she remembers, or if she was a victim to something, selfishly for my own closure about what happened. I\u2019ve spoken to my mom about it recently, she confessed she thought I forgot about it since I was only 6 when it happened. \n\nThis affected me tremendously over time, since I was basically introduced to masturbation very early because of her. I believe it stunted my growth emotionally because I became afraid of other girls my age. \n\nAnyways. Just thought I would share my story. This has been very troubling for me and it\u2019s been difficult navigating this trauma as an adult. Has anyone experienced any similarities? I don\u2019t know anyone else who has gone through this and it\u2019s been hard finding sources online! Some people literally dismiss it as just a phase of curiousity... \n\nThank you", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I live in Germany with my German girlfriend and my parents are back in England. Her parents live just 10 minutes from us here in Germany so it\u2019s really convenient for her to visit her parents and for the last ten years we\u2019ve mostly visted them with the exception of last year when I visited my parents alone because I felt I had to spend at least one Christmas with them since they\u2019re getting older. The plan was that this year we would either visit together or I would not visit my parents.\n\nUnfortunately though, my mum suffered a brain hemorrhage in May and by some miracle survived but she is disabled, partially blind, and needs constant support from my Dad. They\u2019re both in their late 60\u2019s. It\u2019s really tough. \n\nSo when my girlfriend said that she thinks I should go visit my parents back in England for Christmas I was really happy at her support though I explained to her that I felt guilty about going because of saying last Christmas that I would spend this one with her. She said it was important for me to visit my parents for Christmas. I asked if she would come with me but she said no giving the reason that she wants to spend the Christmas with her parents in Germany. Note: she gets on well with my parents, when we are together (like when they have visited us here), we all got on well together.\n\nSo I booked flights but now she is angry that I booked a flight on Christmas Eve to travel to the UK because in Germany Christmas Eve is kind of like their main Christmas day. When I offered to change my flight she told me not to and that she will make plans without me. She is so angry with me though saying I don\u2019t care about her and only think of myself.\n\nIt gets worse though because it\u2019s her 40th birthday on the 29th so I arranged flights so that I come back on the 27th so I can spend her birthday with her. But now she\u2019s angry that I\u2019m going to be here for her birthday saying she is planning a breakfast at our apartment with her friends (and Dad) and then going out with her friends later. She\u2019s saying she wants me to extend my visit to my parents because she doesn\u2019t want me at home on her birthday. This all seems because of her anger at me for flying out on Christmas Eve instead of Christmas Day but If I travelled to my parents on Christmas Day the earliest flight gets me to their house at around 1130am which means I can\u2019t help my Dad cook a Christmas dinner. It\u2019s the first year where my mum doesn\u2019t do the main cooking.\n\nDuring our discussion this morning she wouldn\u2019t speak to me in a calm, healthy manner and she wouldn\u2019t believe me when I said that I couldn\u2019t get a flight to the closer airport to my parents on Christmas Day meaning I\u2019d have to go to an airport that is even further away.\n\nThis is where we get to emotionally abusive more because besides the kind of controlling and hard time I feel I\u2019m getting (like suggesting I go to my parents for Christmas but then attacking me for it) she said some really hurtful things. she said these things:\n- I don't want to see you on my birthday\n- you're the devil\n- you only do what you want\n- you are a liar\n- what you say is bullshit\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate some input and support on this. \n\nIs it really so bad i go to my parents in these circumstances?\nIs it wrong that she won\u2019t come?\nDoes she have to be so nasty and say such hurtful things when I\u2019m trying to do what\u2019s right for my parents, myself, and her?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

He has took and took from me, and did not think to give and take care of his relationship and me as his partner in between his takings. \n\nI have nothing more that I can give to this man. He has took and consumed nearly all of my energy, motivation, time, belief, hope, and emotional well-being. I have ran out of resources and approaches to take in order to repair our relationship, maintain it, and strengthen it. I have nothing left to give or sacrifice. He is depleted me &amp; has psychologically and emotionally broke me down to the point where I lost all hope and belief in his ability to change and my ability to work with him to overcome it. I lost all hope in us having a future together, and when all hope is lost, the relationship is officially dead. \n\nTime is the true teller, and his actions have showed me that his hallow promises &amp; shallow apologizes were nothing more than a temporary means to \u201csolve\u201d the issues so he could feel comfortable once more to get what he wants. He never had real intentions to fulfill the things he promised he would. \n\nIt\u2019s disturbing to hear someone say that the problems we faced stemmed from my personal boundaries and my self-worth; it\u2019s especially even more disturbing to hear those words come out of his mouth, considering he was the person in my life who was suppose to have my best interest in mind always, just like I did for him &amp; claimed he did for me. \n\nAll of the words he spoke, his insincere apologizes, his bullshit claims, and his weak promises were nothing more than filler busters to distort reality. \n\nHe is no longer in my future plans. I no longer want to work with him and fix our issues. I most likely thought that this day would come, and his actions proved this to be true.\n\nWe live together, and are on a lease together until May. I already know that this childish and self-centered man will not move out, since he must have control over everything, especially me since he saw me as nothing more but an object of his that he can choose to use when it\u2019s convenient for him. I have to finish out this lease, and I have no idea what I\u2019m doing since this is the first time I\u2019ve ever lived with an intimate partner. \n\nBut I do know one thing for certain, when one has no hope or is unable to foresee having a future with someone, and does not belief in a partner\u2019s ability to live up to all the things that they personally promised, the relationship is officially done. \n\nMe having hope and belief in his ability to change and our ability to over come conflicts and have a future together is a privilege that he didn\u2019t respect or\nValue, and therefore he lost it &amp; he lost me as a result. \n\nI just have no idea how he will respond, react, and behave once he gets it through his head that our relationship is no more. He has said passive comments throughout our whole relationship about him engaging in stalking behaviors if I were to ever leave him or \u201crun off\u201d. He also freaks out if he doesn\u2019t know where I am. I also removed the location tracker he put on my phone, and I will begin constructing actions plans if he begins engaging in these types of behaviors or other other unhealthy actions. \n\nNow, it is time to take each day as it comes &amp; move through the next year taking it day by day. Documenting any harmful or disrespectful actions or comments he says is vital, and I have been doing that for the last 5 months, so I\u2019ll be able to compare to see if his actions and manipulative behaviors  have intensified. Thank goodness that neither of us have children or pets together. My brother (28.M) lives with us too, and I keep reminding myself of that since it is comforting for me and my safety. \n\nDoes anyone else have any advice or would like to share their experience in similar positions?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The NEX then swoops in an takes custody of the children in common, lies to everyone they knew in common, and then lies to the judge - getting majority custody (all because I was upfront about my PTSD, yet he didn't disclose HIS much worse mental health issues...?!?).\n\nI have now gone without the little family I once knew and loved since the middle of this year. And have missed out on three major holidays, where the NEX didn't even do anything for celebration. No 4th of July fireworks, no Trick or treating, and no turkey or meal for Thanksgiving.\n\nHe's lazy and pathetic, yet charismatic. I fell for him for over 15 years before he left ME for some fling. I'm grateful he's finally gone! But it hurts me so much to think that this year, 2019, has been by far my worst year of life ever. By the hands of that pathetic being no less. And worse???? He was chatting before he left me, obviously. Which means this year has been HIS best.\n\nI came to that reality yesterday, and ended up leaving my turkey in the fridge, thawed and uncooked. No sides made... Nothing cooked in my kitchen that day at all. Not even food was made. For the whole day, I drank a little water, and just didn't eat. A lot of days go like that lately. At what point do I just finally give up? I wanted to kill myself to get rid of him nearly 5 years ago. and even now as he's gone and away from interacting in my daily life (mostly), I'll still have to deal with this NEX mental abuser for minimum, ten more years!?!?

He had raped me, and I oppressed that because he made me think I deserved it. I will NOT forget. I can't forget, because this could all happen all over again.\n\nBut here I sit today, crying in my hands again. I've been trying to change my year for the better. But when I can't work, and bills are getting worse, I just feel like letting myself go under. I have bad days mostly, but at least I'm still gonna be here, trying tomorrow. It kills me thinking I have no control over any of this right now. My children were my everything, because that's what he wanted.

He didn't take, \"I need to leave this house\" as an excuse. Thing is, he doesn't know half the abuse that's gone down between me and his asshole brother/my dad. \n\nThe worst incident that was a turning point in our relationship was a day in 4th grade. I was 10 years old. I don't remember what I did wrong, I think I forgot to clean the litterbox and was running late. My dad told me not to go to school until I had done it. He was in a bad mood. As a defiant little kid, I told him straight-up, no. The second I said that, I was absolutely fucking terrified and shocked that I had said that. He started coming at me and I knew he was going to hit me. I ran. My mom screamed at him to stop as he started to chase me. We reached the dining room table and we were on opposite sides. He couldn't get me from there. He picked up my backpack and threw it at me. It missed, but it scared the shit out of me. I don't remember exactly how that de-escalated, but I walked to school crying my eyes out. I usually walked with my friend (an awesome person who I'm still friends with 10 years later) and I didn't tell her what happened, but she comforted me anyway and helped me get through the rest of the day. That was the first day of physical abuse from him. \n\nDuring middle school, things progressively got worse and worse. I was fed up and, well, a young teen. I fought back hard and said some of the nastiest shit that I would never, EVER say to anyone else. And my mom didn't protect me. She would scold me after our fights that I'm in the wrong and that I need to apologize for \"making him angry\" or \"making him hit me\". The eating disorders started in middle school, as well. Right before 6th grade started. I was extremely underweight and  short for my age. When I look back at old pictures, I was really scrawny. I didn't think anything of it at the time. Towards the end of middle school I almost killed myself because my only two friends had moved away and I felt very alone. My parents noticed I was depressed, violated me by taking my phone and looked through it. They found proof that I was suicidal and blamed me for it. They don't believe in mental illness, and I was accused of using it for depression. I was self-harming at the time and it escalated. \n\nHigh school was when I went through the worst of the abuse. My dad forbade me from hanging out with the only 2 friends I had most of the time and passive-aggressively conveyed that I'm an irresponsible brat who's going to end up washed up in life because I didn't deserve happiness due to the way I \"treated\" him. Admittedly, I said awful shit. But I never started anything. I only ever tried to finish the shit he started. I didn't just randomly fight with him unprovoked. \n\nI remember a specific incident when I was 16. Our basement was flooded with sewer water (it was pretty disgusting). My dad was blaming me and my mom for using too much toilet paper (which was NOT the cause of it, as it turned out). He forbade either of us from using any toilet paper, but HE was allowed to use it. The whole day he was screaming at us and barking orders at us. He forced my mom to take part in cleaning up the basement and draining the water, even after it made her vomit twice. I wasn't too queasy about it but his barking and the way he loomed close behind my back when he was forcing me to do the work was terrifying. I don't quite remember whether or not he hit me that day, but he was using fear to force us to clean up while doing absolutely nothing on his end. I screamed a bunch of shit at him in defense of mom (which sometimes I half-regret doing, since even at that time mom refused to stick up for me). He would sometimes march right up to me as if he was going to hit me, but I think the reason he backed off was because he saw me getting ready to sucker-punch him the fuck back. Keep in mind that my anger had escalated to the point where I (110 lb at the time) was ready to get into a physical fight with a 200 lb 50 y/o war veteran. I was beyond pissed and just wanted it to be over. I ended up storming out and crying my eyes out at the park later that day. It was freezing and all I had to wear was a t-shirt. I hadn't been allowed to shower so I still smelled like sewage (I had wanted to go to the library so I could be warm, but that wasn't an option because of the smell). It was a really shitty day and another turning point in my relationship with my father. \n\nEven last year when I was 19, he shoved me when I was trying to protect my 1yo nephew from his abuse. I had such a bad panic attack that I most likely should have gone to the hospital (I had a severe asthma attack as well and I didn't have an inhaler. I could have died). My mom refused to take me and tried to make me calm down on my own. She got pissed off at me when she forced me to get up and go upstairs and I couldn't move because I was shaking so badly and just had no control over my body or actions. I ended up staying at a friend's house that night because I was too scared to sleep in the same house as my dad. The next day when I came home, I tried to avoid him. I didn't make eye contact or anything. Then he came into the kitchen and made a remark (to himself, not directly to me) that I was acting like an ass. My blood started boiling. \n\n\"I'm never going to get an apology, am I?\"\n\n\"No. Because you deserved it.\" \n\nI spiralled from there. I went up stairs, grabbed 5 bottles of pills, cut, and cried under my desk with a pile of pills just sitting in front of me, contemplating whether or not I was going to take them. I felt worthless and like I really deserved to die and that I was just a nuisance on everyone, just as my dad had told me. My mom came up and found me. When I saw her, I begged her to bring me to the hospital. I will never, EVER forget the look of annoyance on her face when I said that. She complained it was too inconvenient for her and said, \"It can't wait until later?\" \n\nWell, after a bit of swearing and me being very pissed off at her I was brought to the hospital. At the hospital, she was acting all loving and nurturing and like she wanted me to get help and shit... Which pissed me off to no end. I barely spoke to her while I was there. I was discharged the same day and started on anti-depressants. \n\nMy dad and I are barely on speaking terms, even though we still live in the same house. To this day, he thinks my suicide attempt was a manipulative tactic to get back and him and to make him bend. Asshole. \n\nSo yeah. These are things I want to tell my uncle, but my uncle keeps no secrets. He would tell my aunt and my aunt is a druggie who likes to start up drama and manipulate people, so she would definitely tell my dad so she could sit back and watch us fight. My family is essentially fucked. \n\nI don't care if it's hard to live on my own or if it seems like I'm rushing adulthood. I need to get out, now. I've asked for advice about moving on reddit before I found out how toxic the site can be lol, and I've got nothing but criticism but I'm dead set on that decision. If I get therapy while living with him, I'll get mocked for it. I need to get out before any more damage is done. I wish I could explain that to my uncle without consequence.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

My narc told me how horrible he was to her (not sure how I didn't see that as a red flag, ugh) and I know she definitely suffered because her facebook is VERY public and she always posts things about narcissism and quotes about depression and stuff, and I just know it's about my narc especially since her posts line up with everything he's told me.  She has a new boyfriend now and she seems very happy but I have been wanting to reach out to her so bad and just talk to her because she would understand EXACTLY what I went through what the EXACT person. It would give me someone to talk to because I feel so alone and no one in my life really understands what I am going through. I'm hesitant though, because I'm not sure how she will react, plus, she still friends with some of the Narc's friends on facebook and sometimes they \"like\" her posts. I know she has no contact with the actual Narc, and I don't think she communicates with his friends but like I said, there's definitely some \"liking\" involved. But part of me think its just because they think she is attractive and deep down they know the Narc is an asshole and they don't really care if they are \"loyal\" towards him, ya know? BUT if I am wrong and she is still in contact or aquaintances with some of his friends, then I wouldn't want my narc to find out I contacted her or get involved in anything that could hurt me. But she does seem like that and seems like a very sweet girl and similar to me and I want to message her so bad!!! I just can't decide if its a good idea or not.

I just need to get this out and I don\u2019t see my therapist until Tuesday. It\u2019s going to be a long post so you can skip to the current stuff or I\u2019ll give a tldr at the end. \nSerious trigger warning for physical, sexual, and emotional abuse as well as drugs. \n\nHere\u2019s the background. I (24M) was in an abusive relationship from when I was 16-19 with a guy I\u2019ll refer to as \u201cJohn\u201d who was 2 years younger than me. Im transsexual (female to male) and ive been transitioning since I was 14 and had bottom surgery right when I turned 18. This part is going to be very confusing but I\u2019m also 100% straight, not at all attracted to men. We ended up together from him pressuring me for months, getting high and having sex, and feeling like nobody else would ever love me. \n\nHe was very possessive and demeaning. Any time I was upset I was just a pathetic piece of shit. Any time I tried to better my life, it was a waste of time and I\u2019d never actually be able to do it. If I called him out on anything, I was just making it up or twisting it in my head to make him look like the bad guy. He also always wanted sex. Prior to bottom surgery, I was incredibly dysphoric. Most of the time I\u2019d have panic attacks from being touched. Some things I could get through but penetration was the absolute worst and I didn\u2019t want it whatsoever. He knew that but pushed me to do it anyway. I cried every time and he would mock me or get angry about it. This went on until I was 18 and had bottom surgery. He wouldn\u2019t touch me at all then but I still had to give him oral. He mocked my penis saying it looked gross and not like a penis at all. After I graduated high school, he convinced me to no go away to college and to move in with his family instead. Sometime after moving in, he decided he wanted an open relationship. He slept with others, I didn\u2019t. At some point, he convinced his family to take in this girl to get her out of a bad living situation.  I\u2019ll call her \u201cMary\u201d. From day one, Mary kept saying that she loved me. I had no interest in her. She progressed to kissing me and then to groping me. John encouraged it. One night when John was mad at me and made me sleep on the couch, Mary raped me. I left the house and wandered the streets for a while before going back and sleeping on the porch. I woke up to him slapping me and screaming that I cheated on him. I cried and tried to explain but he just burned me with his cigarette and told me to leave. I can\u2019t bring myself to finish the rest of the background story but basically I left, was homeless, he convinced me he changed and I went back. There was a final straw where he threatened me with a knife, gave me a black eye, broke my glasses, smashed my headlight, and jumped on the hood of my car. All contact was cut off after that. He still tries to harass me every 6 months or so. \n\n\nFast forward to now.\n\n I\u2019m married to an amazing woman and have mostly worked through all of this in therapy.  I have occasional flashbacks and nightmares but I considered myself over it. But a couple days ago, by coincidence I got reacquainted with another of his victims I knew. I\u2019ll call this guy \u201cMikey\u201d. Mikey and I got talking and it brought back so much I had blocked out and pieces together some things. \n\nMikey told me about how John gave him that he claimed was weed but was actually spike and wouldn\u2019t let him go to the hospital. I had totally forgot about it but one time John gave me what I though was weed and I ended up having a siezure. I thought it was just an interaction with my meds but now I know that he drugged me. Mikey also brought up one of johns friends I\u2019ll call Tyler. Mikey told me about John letting Tyler rApe him. I\u2019d entirely blocked this out, but Tyler forced me to suck his dick, with John egging it on. That brought up memories of John setting me up to have sex with other friends of his. \n\n\nTL;DR I was in an abusive relationship 5 years ago as a teenager, I reconnected with another one of the abusers victims, and it brought out repressed memories. \n\nI don\u2019t even know how to deal with this. It\u2019s like I\u2019m back at the beginning before I started working through all of this. I couldn\u2019t sleep last night because of it. I\u2019ve had 3 panic attacks today even with taking my anxiety meds. I talked to my wife about it and she\u2019s very supportive but I\u2019m still so overwhelmed.

The only person I have barely talked about this with is my husband, and even him I have barely explained any details as I feel guilty even at the suggestion. Throwaway for that reason.\n\nFor as long as I can remember, I have had the same exact dream/nightmare. I feel disgusting even typing it out. In the dream I am around 3-5 years old (estimate, based on my size in comparison to adults in the dream) and I am sitting at a play desk with some toys, both of which I do not explicitly remember having. I am in my family living room. My father is sitting behind me with his legs spread around me and he proceeds to be inappropriate with my rubbing something hard (what I now know to be what I assume to be an erection) against my back as I am pressed to his crotch. In the dream he is also touching me inappropriately, and I am very scared and want to get away but I cannot move. I also have various variations of this nightmare in slightly different situations. I got them around once a month as a child, but as an adult, maybe get them 2-3 times a year, and it distresses me greatly.\n\nI've had this dream since before I even knew what sex/penis/erections were. I wouldn't put any credence to it, except that it causes me a lot of distress. I recently found a photo of me (my parents were moving away, and I was going through old stuff) and it includes me at around 3 years old, playing at the exact play desk with the exact toys that are in the dream that I didn't previously remember having. This all makes me wonder if something like this actually happened. My dad has always been verbally and somewhat physically abusive growing up, but I've worked through that in therapy and am over that now. He often made inappropriate comments about my breasts and body as I went through puberty and how my dress was too \"sexy\" for my 7th grade dance (it went past my knees, and didn't show cleavage, so idk). And as I went into high school, was very possessive of me when it came to various guys I dated, at one point pulling my by my hair out of my female friend's house when I was 17, because there was a male there past 8pm.\n\nI would deal with it and move past it, regardless of if it happened or not, if my dad hadn't recently taken a caregiving role over a female infant relative of mine. Now I find myself concerned, and somewhat complicit, if something were to happen to her. I do have experiences with sexual assault from a partner when I was 18, and I am worried if my trauma from that, and anger from abuse from my dad, has made me overly paranoid. I don't know what to think or do, and I don't know if what happened is real. This is essentially a call into the void for help.\n\nAnd yes, I know what suppressed memory is, and am aware that there is a lot of evidence that much of it is falsely and iatrogenically introduced via therapy. I have never had a therapist ask if I was molested as a child, so that is not the case here.\n\nTLDR; Since I was 5 years old I have had extremely specific nightmares about being molested by my father. My father is \"sexually off\" so to speak. My dad now is the caregiver of a female infant. Are my dreams real, and should I be concerned?\n\nThank you to anyone who read this far, I am truly sorry this was so long.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

First, I'd like to say thank you for taking the time to read this post and possibly shed some insight into my specific situation.\n\nSo, I was born in 1995. My dad ran off as soon as my mom told him she was pregnant. I never heard from him.. ever. So my family decided it would be best if I lived with my grandparents for a while. \"A while\" turned into my entire childhood.\n\nMy mom was, at least what I would consider, a mental terrorist.\n\nShe would always be extremely repetitive, repeating whatever she was saying at a minimum of 8 times. She has never let me know anything about her. During my childhood she would call every day (this was before everyone had a cell phone and could text/social media message) and ask me a wide range of details about myself. Whenever I would ask her a question back, her answer was \"We aren't talking about me right now, we're talking about you.\" And she would never budge in any direction with that. To this day, all I know about her is her name and birthday. Not an address or any other detail, small or large.\n\nShe was very intimidating, controlling, and secretive with each and every detail of everything. When she would come visit every year or so, she would have to drive and always had to be in control of every aspect of everything.\n\nWhen I was very young, and I would do something very cringe, she would get very loathsome and aggressive towards me. Not threatening exactly, but there was that sense of imminent danger if I didn't answer any question or do exactly as she said.\n\nShe commands her new husband to do everything for her, and unfortunately he is very submissive. I think she might get some level of sick satisfaction out of it. She doesn't allow him to talk to his family without her being in the room with the phone on loud so she can hear every detail, and she injects herself into their conversations and sensors some menial or minor detail out of his side of the conversation. This is obviously very controlling, but I don't have a better term for it.\n\nThe level of secretiveness is best exemplified by this story. When my grandfather passed away, she came to see him at his deathbed. After the ordeal was said and done, my grandmother and her walked to the parking garage of the hospital and my grandmother noticed she had gotten a new car. My mom screamed at my grandmother and threatened her if she said anything to anyone about the new car. Seems pretty extreme if you ask me.\n\nI'm not asking for a diagnosis of her symptoms. That would be almost impossible over a Reddit post. However, I am trying to figure out if this seems like some manifestation of mental illness or simply just a bad personality. If there are any questions that might help to clarify the story, please feel free to ask!\n\nThank you all for your time again, and have a wonderful day!", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

How do I broach the subject?", "author": "insulin4all", "self_text": "I have just sort of put all the pieces together and I believe my friend (28 F) is dating a narcissist (27 M). Firstly, she gained a lot of weight in the past 2 years and I think her self esteem is low. She doesn't have a job because of health issues and lives with her parents. She definitely got love bombed by this guy. He bought her nice shoes, an iPhone, and even a flight across the country within the first couple of months of them dating. He is from a different country so there is always a slight disconnect. \n\nHere is other evidence I see of his narcissism: When we are hanging out with him, he doesn't ask me or my friends any questions about ourselves. He doesn't try to get to know me or my friends at all. Also, the night before Thanksgiving he yelled at her (the girlfriend) in front of people in a bar parking lot because he was upset that she wanted to stay at the bar longer with me. He then left the premises and then came back and made another scene. Apparently he is very possessive of her ( I've heard from other friends.)\n\nI also think there has been some future faking involving her going to India with him. Idk much about that though.\n\nI was always highly sceptical of this relationship. First, I thought he was dating her to get his citizenship/ a green card. Now, I think it is much more than that... It sucks because he has met her family and all that. \n\nRegarding telling her about her potential narcissist: I think I want to send her an article about love bombing because that is the most obvious red flag that I think she will be able to see. But how would you bring this to her attention? Would you bring it to her attention at all? \n\nThanks y'all!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have had it for my whole life but some prominent things started to develop in January.  First off I started seeing this Aura which many doctors have called impossible. The problem is that it is real. So they have developed a lack in trust in me. I was diagnosed by a doctor recently, but they were told about it in June. \n\nThe problems, first off I have needed new glasses since May, they only last week took me to get new glasses meaning I had been living my life for the most part in school out of other people's vision. I have struggled in school quite a bit because of this. Second, I researched my syndrome and their are some things which that can get prescribed to help me deal with it as well as therapy which can help to prevent me causing Depersonalization Disorder. I have talked to my parents and I can assure that they have not even researched what the condition was on their phone or on their laptops.\n\nSkip forward today where my Depersonalization kicked in, and I was not hungry. They yelled at me and force-fed me. It was sad because I was not hungry and did not know how to respond. Luckily we had some guests, so I was saved by them. I was also forced yesterday to go out in the middle of the night, to go down from my apartment to the bottom floor to put a trash bag which I could not lift away. (Yes I am weak.)\n\nIt has not helped that in the past where I was suicidal and depressed that they were told straight up by some of my friends that I was feeling such, **in front of me**. They never talked about it and have never asked anything about it.\n\nTL;DR: I have a syndrome called Visual snow and when I have been suicidal and depressed and they have not been confronted they have not done anything. I have needed several things like glasses but they have taken long periods of time to do such, and will not research anything which is wrong with me. **Also this is all what came to my head at the time of writing.**", "subreddit": "abuse"}

This started with my mom when I was a very young. If I was talking too much, about anything really (like normal kids do) she would mock my voice, say it was annoying. This repeating through my life has made me hate my own voice. If I defended myself, she would scream at me, and often blast a certain song as high as the volume could go, and also scream/sing along to it. The song was \"One step closer\" by Lincoln Park. \n\nThat probably sounds silly to those that know the song, but to put it in perspective the song was released in 2000, and I was only 6 years old. At this age, I was already in intensive therapy for being sexually abused by another relative. The fact that she would make it as loud as possible, usually in a confined space like the car or living room, was very painful.\n\n\nThis same general line of events has occured from abuser to abuser since I've left my mom. When I defend myself from them being well..abusive I am told that my voice is annoying. That it would stop if I'd just shut up. If I don't shut up it will result either in abandonment techniques, or something I care about will be taken away or destroyed.  Also still, occasionally music blasted as loud as possible or turning the TV up to full volume. When I do stop talking, that doesn't mean they stop saying abusive things to me. It only means I am not allowed to respond.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I didn't cheat on him, I must have had it for years because it was advanced enough that it started seriously compromising my health. The diagnosis was very rough for me. I felt like my life was ending and I couldn't believe that I wasnt waking up from this dream. \n\n\nI went to him right after the doctor told me. He was angry at first and was bringing up the idea that I gave it to him. We agreed that he needed to get tested. He was negative. He gave me the silent treatment for several days. Keep in mind we lived together. Any time he would see me, he would look so disgusted with me. As if I was the AIDS girl now and that's all he could see. \n\n\nEventually, he came to terms with it. He told me he loved me and he would support me in any way I needed. At this point my body was breaking down and I was getting started on medication that was really rough on my body. I felt like I was dying for several weeks.\n\n\nFast forward to another 2 years down the line with him. Things were really rough. We had gotten a new 2 bedroom apartment so he could have his own game room, mainly so I didnt have to listen to him yell at the games all day. He was very verbally abusive to me and would tell me he was just joking. I didn't know it at the time, but he was sexually coercing me the whole time as well. He would make jokes about my HIV status when I asked him not to. \n\n\nOne day we got in a particularly bad fight where he was in his game room and I tiptoed back there trying not to set him off. I asked him if he would come to the grocery store with me and he wouldn't answer me. He had been ignoring me for days. I sat down and cried, asking him how we could fix our relationship. My crying had always made him angry, I don't know why I didn't think of that. He got up and towered over me, and yelled as loud as he could, making sure all of our neighbors could hear.\n\n\n\"NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE STUPID, YOU ARE FAT, YOU'RE USELESS, AND YOU HAVE AIDS\" \n\n\nI decided that not ever being loved was better than being abused by him. So I broke up with him. He was just fine with it. He gladly got all his things and left. A few days later he was calling and texting non stop apologizing for how he had treated me. He even had the audacity to bring up how he was \"there for me through my diagnosis\". I told him that he had 3 years to apologize to me and he never did so it was over. \n\n\nThat was 2 years ago. I still think about it all the time.I have a lot of issues from that relationship still that I want to work through before seeing if he was right about no one loving me.

I can\u2019t keep going the way I have been.  So I\u2019m posting here and getting a therapist on Monday.\n\nDuring the marriage, I sure wasn\u2019t perfect.  But I didn\u2019t know that she had previously diagnosed anger issues.   She would throw plates at me, get me involved in her disputes with family and friends (including her own mother), tell me I worked too much but spend tons of money and then when I would try to deal with it blame it on me instead of getting a job.  I had a high stress career, and eventually started drinking too much.  It all ended with her taking my kids out of state.  I didn\u2019t have the heart to divorce her and bring my kids back, and my career requires licensure in a given state and I was the sole provider.  I I convinced myself she would come back but she never did.  Eventually, she used my drinking problem as an excuse to take out a restraining order against me after she punched me in the face in front of my kids, lying to the court saying that I had abused her.  That was my bottom \u2014 3 plus years ago and I checked into rehab and have been sober ever since.  \n\nShe had a free lawyer in the divorce from the false allegations of abuse (who threatened to drop her eventually if she did not stop and settle).  Even though I was willing to give her all of the marital assets, she accused me of hiding assets (I didn\u2019t), I was forced to borrow 50k from my parents to pay legal fees and a settlement because she wouldn\u2019t even give me joint legal custody of our kids and demanded more money than I had.  I\u2019ve always paid more than guidelines in child support, but she compares me to a \u201cgarbage man\u201d or to husbands of other divorced friends.  She calls me \u201ccrazy,\u201d a \u201cno ball pussy loser\u201d or a \u201cpiece of shit\u201d whenever I refuse to give her more money.  She tells me the kids will know one day what happened.  She stonewalls me on basic issues when I visit the kids even though I\u2019m always on a tight timeline for travel.\n\nDuring the divorce, she allowed a lease in my name to be repossessed in violation of a court order and ruined my credit, then blamed it on me failing to buy her a car.  She hacked into my email accounts shortly before the divorce to gather emails that she then threatened to use against me.  I accidentally gave her access to text messages when setting up an iPad I bought for my kids and she accused me of abuse for exposing her to negative text messages about her that I\u2019d talked to with my friends. She also threatened to accuse my dad, a well-respected member of our community, of being a pedophile to prevent their access to my kids.  She calls my family abusive.\n\nTo be clear, I made my amends to her for my role in things by drafting a long email apologizing for my drinking and egotistical behavior at certain times, and also trying to be the best father I can be.  I\u2019ve also paid for some extra things and tried to be over the top kind with her even when she\u2019s mad or stonewalling.\n\nSince that time, I\u2019ve revived my career, my kids love me to death and come for the summers and holidays, I\u2019ve recently remarried to a wonderful person (who happens to be a social work professor) who I trust and love with all my heart.  We\u2019ve been together 3 years with no fights. \n\nBut every time my ex starts in with the messages, it sets me off and ruins my day.  It\u2019s usually about me paying more money, most recently over a proposed increase in support where I\u2019m asking for a reduction to account for my tremendous travel expenses.  It\u2019s the same old comments, and I start wondering, \u201cam I a terrible person?  Should I give her more money and pay for things not in the order?  She\u2019s now using my new family against me, saying that when my kids see photos on social media someday they\u2019ll wonder why I\u2019m there for my stepson and \u201cnew family.\u201d\n\nTruth is, even though I\u2019m in conflict-ridden profession, I can\u2019t handle her.  I\u2019m worried she\u2019ll try to take away or control my kids altogether (she\u2019s done it once at the beginning of the divorce), falsely accuse me of abuse (she\u2019s a good liar), take all of my money by telling her version of the truth, etc.  my reaction and the ruined days are not fair to anyone that cares about me, but I just can\u2019t control it.  It feels like up is down, left is right, etc.   I\u2019m a happy person with a great life, but I can\u2019t deal with this on my own anymore.\n\nIf anyone actually read this whole thing, thank you.

The way they project their feelings of superiority might not look the same from person to person, but you just end up getting a sense that they think they're better than you, regardless of how genuinely nice/capable/intelligent/whatever you actually are (at least some of which were probably their reasons for targeting you in the first place). One person I'm trying to remain \"friends\" with basically no longer resembles the person I originally met in terms of our interactions (par for the course with a narcissist), and they basically no longer seem interested in even a text conversation. The responses I have gotten are weirdly formal, perfunctory, and just totally devoid of any life or enthusiasm; even over text the underlying message seems to be \"I'm too good to talk to you.\" If they actually do ask about me (something generic, like \"how are you?\"), anything I say about myself is ignored. They basically won't allow a conversation to happen, often waiting to respond until they're going to bed or otherwise somewhere where any momentum in the conversation will be killed (not sure why they respond at all, tbh). It feels like a continuation of them managing down my expectations, but of course my anxious mind says I'm an annoying asshole and the one with the problem (keep in mind that weeks will pass between messages, so it's not like I'm harassing this person or anything, and the messages I do send are always very much focused on them). It's just hard not to want to take the blame for the change in communication pattern and overall tone that I receive. I end up feeling boring and pathetic because there's never a chance to really talk about much of anything of substance, try as I might. It's the cognitive dissonance of someone having tell me that they want to stay in touch as \"friends\" while they do less and less and are less \"friendly\" with every interaction.\n\nNarcissists I've encountered professionally end up seeming like they're only ever tolerating people regardless of how competent those people are (and especially if they might actually be more competent and respected than the narc himself). They also seem to really want to be \"friends\" with their colleagues (especially people that are technically their subordinates), even if they treat those people like crap, but the friendships often end up looking like hostage situations because people feel obligated to show up/do something for the N lest they incur his/her wrath (even though it seems like the people that fall for this end up getting the worst of it one way or another). I'm working with someone right now that clearly has no respect for anyone he interacts with unless they're giving him a chance to look good and take all the credit. I'd go so far as to say that he actually hates some of the people he works with, even people he hired or will praise to others. I've personally avoided falling for the friend trap with workplace narcissists (and I think I've paid at least a small price for it), but I have never seen it end well for people that have gotten sucked in. It's like other people are a necessary evil and nothing more.\n\nMaybe it's in keeping with the general theme of people just being a means to an end for a narcissist, and I know narcs gonna narc regardless of how amazing the people in their world are and how much those people might care about the N, but I just want to know if the vibe I'm getting is accurate and how others have seen the \"I'm too good for you\" attitude play out in more subtle ways.

As part of that, starting right after that big thing, I stay in the car now for child exchanges, and my mom hands the child off and picks him up. That weekend 2 weeks ago, nEx played acquiescent directly after his hissy fit to my mom, acting like he was bending over backwards trying to \"meet my demands.\" My mom told him she doesn't care, she's not getting involved. When the child was returned, my mom was out there suspiciously long while he was talking about who knows what. I brought it up to her, she just kind of brushed it off as \"making conversation\" and that she ignored it anyway. \n\n\nCut to this weekend, and my mom gets my child out of the car and hands him off and nEx keeps her there talking for 10 full minutes... Idk what he was talking about. But I could hear my mom saying things like when my child had eaten and he had a runny nose... it was clear to me *she* was making conversation either based off of his mannerisms or she was waiting for something that he wasn't doing. \n\n\nI talked to my mom about this when she got back in the car. I told her he was intentionally keeping her out there forever, either to look for a way to manipulate her or dig for info or just make it more uncomfortable for me to sit in the car or bc he thinks I'll get about and bitch about how long it's taking. But it is *definitely* intentional for whatever purpose. I'm not entirely sure what he's doing, but I could hear how uncomfortable my mom was in her voice. She wanted to leave, but didn't want to be rude, and he was clearly lingering bc she just kept filling the awkwardness with more talking. It's possible though he was talking a lot to her and I just couldn't hear him. She says she was waiting until he got the child in the car seat. So from what I can tell, he's just standing there saying things to the baby and kind of talking to her, while not doing anything to actually leave, waiting for my mom to feed him all kinds of info and just make both of us uncomfortable. I know my mom doesn't want to be rude. I'm the same way, but that's obviously part of the problem. I flat-out told her... there's no reason to wait for him to put the kid in the car seat. I know it sucks. It rips my heart out a little each time not being able to give him a hug and a kiss right before he leaves the car. But it's better than the alternative. I know you don't just want to get in and drive away. It's hard and it feels shitty. But, the alternative here is him keeping you out there for 30 minutes or more, you getting increasingly uncomfortable and weirded out while he has the chance to say all kinds of things he hopes I'll hear and ply you for info about me and play nice guy. I told her he hasn't once bothered to tell me any helpful info when my child came back, whether he had eaten or napped or anything. There is no reason she needs to tell him those things. \n\n\nMy mom obv knows what a POS he is, but I'm concerned she doesn't get the full extent of the kind of problem this can turn into, and I want to stop it before it gets worse. He's just starting to use *her* as a supply instead of me. And I know she thinks she's not going to get \"sucked into it\" or he can't manipulate her, but from where I'm sitting he already is. And it will only get worse, bc he wants her to think that. He wants her to feel confident, bc he will slowly erode that without her noticing and she'll be as deep as she possibly can in his bullshit before she knows it. \n\n\nI need this to stop. Now.

I want it to come from somewhere other than me, bc I need her to understand this is not me reading into the situation. idk if she thinks that, but I want to be sure she gets that this is dangerous territory, and that she has the right tools to combat it. I can share my info about grey rock with her, but I was hoping someone might have something that explains the manipulation without noticing aspect really well, along with the need to be a little rude. I hope that makes sense.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have spent years trying to figure this woman out. Mostly blaming myself for not being good enough or running around in circles hoping to avoid her tantrums and insults. We hardly speak. I despise her so much I can barely look at her. She has been the most verbally abusive person I have ever known.  But what pisses me off the most is when I watch her interact with people and see how much they adore her (Particularly family). It makes me sick. She has intentionally highlighted mistakes I\u2019ve made to exaggerate them to others.  She makes things up about me to her friends and family just to make herself appear better than me.? I can\u2019t count how many times an argument has occurred between us and the next thing I know her family or our mutual friends are treating me differently or even with a degree of cruelty.  This has been the loneliest experience of my life. Almost everyday there is some sort of disgust or discontent she projects. I can\u2019t count the hurtful things she\u2019s hurled my way, but the one I can never un-hear is when I was still in mourning after my sister\u2019s sudden death. I was sitting on the couch quietly to myself. She walks up with her hands on her hips with this exhausted/impatient look and says the she\u2019s \u201ctired of dealing with my feelings\u201d! \n\nEdit: took out bad language", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It\u2019s heartbreaking that we go through this. \n\nI\u2019m scared to admit this but my husband has narcissistic tendencies. I don\u2019t think he has the personality disorder, he may have some neurological stuff going on- but the result is the same. I feel the same. \n\nI\u2019m always wrong. He throws things I\u2019ve shared with him (maybe from months before) in my face when he\u2019s feeling vindictive. He really can\u2019t be accountable. If I try to approach him with an issue I may have, he tells me I\u2019m starting fights, but then he will do exactly that- it\u2019s like he will get so angry over me being imperfect, and then I\u2019m left feeling like I\u2019m a bad person. He\u2019s the one starting these arguments. I guess more and more I do the same because I\u2019m just so hurt and angry. I know it\u2019s toxic and I don\u2019t want to be like him. \n\nHe can\u2019t ever be wrong. And if I make a mistake, he almost seems relieved or glad. He walks away from me, ignores me, goes to sleep, and then acts like nothing is wrong. Nothing ever gets resolved. I\u2019m not allowed to be human. \n\nWe\u2019ve been together 6 years and while I came into the relationship with my own baggage, (I\u2019m in therapy and try hard to work on myself) but it\u2019s hard. I\u2019m so so tired, worn down and I barely leave my house. I also have physical issues and the stress is definitely not helping. \n\nI just feel like a shell, like I\u2019m nobody. I have always struggled with depression, but this is a different level. This is hell. Again I\u2019m seeing a therapist but I need extra support. \n\nToday is just hard. I don\u2019t really have any support anymore. I messed up some of my friendships/ relationships because I\u2019m just never feeling well and I\u2019m miserable. So he didn\u2019t isolate me, I did. \n\nI really don\u2019t like how I react to him- I scream and yell. I know that\u2019s not okay. I try to stay calm/ not react but it\u2019s so hard. I feel like he doesn\u2019t want peace and I just feel disrupted all the time. I want to be strong and not let him get to me. I can\u2019t leave right now. \n\nI\u2019m just feeling sad and hopeless.

This guy was everything to me but in the last 6 months I realised that I (f29) was being abused by him (m31).\n\nIt started off small, name calling but saying he was joking, calling me stupid, when I did something silly or something accidental his go to insult was pointing out my stupidity. \n\nWhen we fought it was my fault, I  was told I didn\u2019t care about his feelings even though I was the one trying to fix what I thought I had done and apologise profusely. He never apologised, refused to talk about feelings because that\u2019s not what he did. I would live in silence for days waiting for him to talk to me again. I spent years walking on eggshells afraid to have an opinion or a different point of view. \n\nHe was all I had, I moved overseas away from family for work, I met him and everything seemed to click into place. \n\nI\u2019ve been seeing a councillor for the last 6 months because I just wasn\u2019t feeling right, he\u2019d tell me I couldn\u2019t control my emotions and it was all on me.\n\nI started to get braver and found my voice he didn\u2019t like that. \n\nTwo weeks ago, I was at a work party for his office. I was having a great time and even went out afterwards with some girls he worked with. He hated that. \n\nI came home drunk, which I think was my saving grace because when he kicked off about what a mess I was and what an embarrassment I was I found the courage to yell back. I told him I hated him, I said I wanted to leave that I should have done it months ago. He then proceeded to through my clothes from the bedroom, he punched holes in walls, grabbed me so forcefully that I still have bruises, he pulled doors off hinges and for his final act through the engagement ring he had bought for me at my head.\n\nI locked myself in the spare bedroom and left the next morning at 6am. I am not going back.\n\nSince then everything has been messy, it\u2019s a real jekyl and hyde situation one day he is great and open to communication (I still have stuff to collect, he had all my savings as he controlled the money and the worst thing is we share a dog together who is like my child).\n\nI\u2019ve had good days and bad, it doesn\u2019t feel like is getting easier. Everyone tells me I\u2019ve done the hardest thing, everyone was relieved when I left, even his family, who have tried getting him help but he doesn\u2019t think he needs any.\n\nI\u2019m heartbroken, I loved him and I feel like the failure because it didn\u2019t work.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

It seems like knowing them since childhood makes it hard to get clarity.", "author": "toxiciteeee", "self_text": "I met my boyfriend Q when we were 13 and we started dating at 15. We were never an on/off type of couple, but we broke up about a year and a half ago and have a weird dynamic now, though things were never really \"normal\" with us I guess. \n\nOur failed breakup and having the experience of being placed with an overt narc partner at work in the middle of it has led to me learning a lot about narcissism and personality disorders in the last year or so. I learned a lot about how childhood experiences factor in and how a lot of narcs did experience some form of childhood trauma, neglect, abandonment, etc. Throughout this time I was trying to determine if Q is really an N/person with unchanging negative personality traits, or just someone with a tough childhood who needed to learn how to have healthy relationships. I guess I'm finally realizing that someone having those things happen to them does not make it my obligation to stay with them, but I think witnessing a lot of the neglect is what has made it so hard to stop making excuses for him.\n\nI have often said that I wouldn't put up with half of what Q does if it were someone I didn't have such a history with. Then I think, \"Well he was doing those things in the beginning, too!\" But we were teenagers in the beginning, which also makes things hard. I find a lot of information about narcissistic relationships is naturally using a discussion framework of people who get together as adults. I can definitely look back and see how he might've love-bombed me and put me on a pedestal in the beginning, but it's also so easy to excuse all of that as normal teenage cringe. Or when I hear that it's a red flag for relationships to start out super intensely, that's also easy to excuse as normal for teenagers.\n\nTrying not to turn this into a novel of my experiences with him lol. Anyone else have any perspective on this?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}
