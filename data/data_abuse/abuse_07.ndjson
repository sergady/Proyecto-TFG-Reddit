His version of kink play involved a lot of coercion so that is why I refer to it as \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\nAside from the kink stuff, he guilted me into watching him masturbate or touching him \u201cjust a little\u201d every single day otherwise I wasn\u2019t \u201chelping him out,\u201d called me selfish for not wanting to have sex, become upset if I masturbated and didn\u2019t have sex with him instead (even though he masturbated OFTEN), would take me on trips and say \u201cwe\u2019re already been here two days and we\u2019ve only had sex once?\u201d, wake me up in the middle of night, pull my pants down and fuck me (it was consensual but still felt so used like a body to jerk off into), get mad if I stopped during sex because I got him all worked up. \n \nWarning: this story involves poop. \n\nMy ex was a self proclaimed coprophile (someone who gets sexual pleasure from playing with/sometimes eating excrement) and cuck (someone who gets off to their partner being fucked by other men)\n\nNow, I am a very very open-minded person. I am into some kink myself but only ever tried bondage so when he first presented me with the poop fetish, he presented it as \u201chis greatest shame\u201d something \u201che would kill himself if anyone found out\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m just so sweet and kind, I seem like someone finally understand\u201d \n\nSo I\u2019m like sure I\u2019ll poop in your mouth? I mean... why not? *At worst, it will be a funny story to tell one day, right?*\n\nAs for the cuck/wife-sharing, he asked me to tell him my most dirty stories during sex involving me having sex with men with large penises or did something naughty like fucked in public or cheated. \n\nI figured why not? Sounds like I can have sex outside (with his permission) sounds kinda fun. *What could go wrong?*\n\nWell, he used the stories I told him against me to claim I was probably gonna cheat and he was deliberately ambiguous about the current status of our \u201cplay\u201d so he could punish me for going out of line.  He would post our info online to hotwife subreddits and masturbate to the replies and show me the dick pics they were sending \u201cme.\u201d Even when I clearly wasn\u2019t interested. \n\nI am a sex worker and I was when we met. He slowly started interrogating me about my clientele, ordering me to lose contact with certain ones who were reliable regulars, demanding I read the texts as a way to get him off or feed into his controlling of my work. \n\nI begged him please not to fetishize my work as I understand he had a cuck fetish but this is my *job* and it requires actual work like getting ready every day, diet, exercise, maintaining a veil of happiness and charisma even through my rough personal life, being used regularly by mostly extremely unattractive men. I said I\u2019d be happy to fulfill your fantasies and needs in other ways but please don\u2019t ask me about work as fuel to masturbate. These aren\u2019t things that brought me sexual satisfaction, it\u2019s *work* He refused to see my point of view. \n\nHe even coerced me by nagging and asking over and over into sending him a video of me sucking off a client and turned out that client robbed me and deceived me out of a lot of money. Without his controlling use of his fetish on my actual job, this con man wouldn\u2019t have a video of me sucking him off :( but that\u2019s another horrible trauma in and of itself. \n\nHe claimed \u201cwell what do you expect? I am a man with a fetish and I find your work hot\u201d I said well, a lot of the other girls have husbands and kids or boyfriends and they don\u2019t have to end their hard day by explaining gory details to their partners. Again, *I\u2019m* selfish. \n\nI actually used to find my job empowering and I loved it. I always considered myself a very sexually free and confident woman but this man used me.... he used me as a tool to get off. He even criticized my work during fights but also forced me to tell him stories so he could jerk off. Or guilt me into doing sex acts cause \u201c I do it with other guys so why not him\u201d he humiliated me and drained me of my soul....\n\nNow I am disgusted by my body. And none of it has to do with sex work. But by him and how he treated me. I didn\u2019t feel like a sex object when i was being explicitly paid for a service. I feel as though I am sex object when the man I \u201clove\u201d exploited me and consistently crossed my boundaries by fetishizing my work in an uncomfortable way and demanding new things from me daily. \n\nDespite my sexual history and work, I was innocent and generous. I loved to satisfy my partners, discuss kinks and mutual pleasure, high sex drive, enjoyed intimacy and connecting through sex with people I loved... now it feels so empty.\n\nI used to be into submission and bondage, but now the thought of submitting to a man... even one who isn\u2019t genuinely trying to control me absolutely disgusts me...I was a tool to get what he wanted, a game to see how far I would go for him, a trophy to show off and in the process he drained me of any passion I had...Now I feel bitter and sex turns me off almost entirely.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When we got in touch, I was completely up and running. You are empathetic, intelligent, beautiful, fun and filled with a lot of other qualities that I haven't seen in others ever. You have given me joys, sorrows, reflection, self-insight, the best sex I've ever had, wonderful smiles, unique experiences and your very distinct presence. I'm in love with you and I'm afraid to say it out loud to you because I don't want to scare you away - but it's what it is. I'm in love with you. I love you. I want you close to me, both physically and mentally. I want to share my life with you, with everything it entails, whether it's success on my job, anxiety attacks and everything else pops up. I want to hear about your ambitions, I want to know your favorite food, your favorite color, what you are afraid of, what you dream of, what people are scaring and who makes you rest in yourself - and I want to be one of the last. Yeah, I love you and I believe in this. You are the best thing that has happened to me for longer than what is pleasant to admit. I know you are hardly ready for a specific relationship, but I would like to be the one who can hold you while you find out. The joy I feel when I'm with you, I can't remember having had before ever.\n\nAnd when I said I didnt feel like that and we hardly know eachother and still want to end the relation, he flipped to this:\n\nFuck you! I have given so much of myself to you, and abandoned so much of myself to others. I have dedicated everything I had in me to finding out what could have been, and I feel like you are wiping ass with it all right now. I feel I have never had a chance because everything I have said has turned against me. When I have said that I have loved you, loved you or been in love, it has turned to something negative - pretty much every time! So why do I know how to insist that I really believe in this? Obviously because I find myself being stabbed in the back, beaten in the stomach and dying with a lot of verbal and mental punches. And I no longer bother - I can't do it anymore. I feel my path is clean, but apparently not clean enough for you. Find your Mr. Perfect in an adventure book, because you can't find him in me. There is only an ordinary person with genuine feelings that can only be ripped apart for so long. fuck You !\n\nI didnt really respond much, just tried to grey rock the situation. He then after said he didnt mean a word of it and that he was just upset. It reminds me of my nex.

Lets call him \"Jon\".  I pretty much knew Jon since we were in diapers. Our moms were best friends since college and to make it even better we were next-door-neighbors. He was my best friend in the entire world. He has always been a bit odd growing up, but nothing too concerning. Unfortunately, when he hit around 19 years of age he started to show signs of paranoid schizophrenia. In the months to come, it continues to get worse, and he is mentioning things such as he believes the cops are following him everywhere, he believes the president is watching his every move, that he is being stalked on an online video game, everybody is talking badly behind his back, etc. Very concerning stuff here.\n\nFast forward a couple months and things have not got much better. He actually has become very hostile towards everybody and an extremely negative person. For example : When I would be hanging out with him all he would talk about is how stupid people are  and that he is smarter than everybody else and that everybody, including his parents, hate him and want to kill him. He would talk about things such as the president is watching his every move and is going to assassinate him one day. Also that all the cops in our neighborhood are stalking him. This can become very exhausting listening to all of this regardless of trying to be understanding of his mental illness . I keep reminding myself to be understanding because I know he has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia; but a large part of me just wants to end our friendship. I am not sure if this is extremely selfish of me or self care. To make this easier on the reader I am going to make this next story very short. Long story short, one day he ended up in a really heated argument with his mom and punched her in the face and tried to choke her out and kill her in his own backyard. Luckily a neighbor heard her screaming and jumped the fence and tackled him. He served six months in jail for aggravated assault and unlawful imprisonment. His dad paid his $15,000 bail to get him out of prison. To end this story I just want to say my family has been giving me shit for not reaching out to him and completely cutting him out of my life. They tell me he needs people there for him because he is mentally ill. But I strictly refuse to ever be back in his life because he was the most toxic person I have ever been around.

I feel better if I can share my story and I constantly need approval  that this was really not okay what happened.\n\n\nBackstory : Last year I had quite a bad time and struggled with selfharm so I joined \u00a0web site dedicated to this.\n\nOn that site I saw a person(let's call him Joe) writing that he wants to commit suicide over an ex girlfriend. I felt bad for him and wrote that he can message me if he likes to talk . I had a similar problem. He send me his phone number. And here the crap began. We started writing on whatsapp and I told him about my problem and so on. Joe was a 33 year old man and I'm an 18 year old girl who was mentally labile and naive af. He said he wants to kill himself on his ex birthday but I kinda stopped him ? \n\n\n\n\nWe kept writing everyday and me being extremely lonely and desperate didnt even notice how weird it is when a grown man wants 'friendship' with a teenage girl from a different continent!! \n\n\n\nAs we talked everyday he always informed me when he selfharmed and sent me photos of it. I still didnt see any red flags. And when I had done this he actually never told me to stop and get help like an adult should say but sent those drool emojis. Once he wanted a picture of my scars and stupid me sent him one. He found it \u00a0beautiful. This was so disgusting and got even worse. After 4 weeks he started always informing me when he was laying naked in his bed or bathing. I found everything so gross but I didnt want to lose the only person I had to chat with so I kept talking to him. Then Joe started to make comments like if he would see me naked he would only stare at my scars or expressing his sexual fantasies about me. He asked me if I atleast had gone down on  Hanna (my former best friend and the person I once had a girl crush on) . Remark that when I had contact with Hanna we were 15 year olds. Joe also kept digging on stuff like if my parents talked with me about sex or if I had experience with a boys penis or masturbate. I was too scared and stupid so I told the truth and denied everything . He asked why I dont do any of this and maybe I would start if he sends me his ..... I ignored this. Joe told me to have first time sex before Im 21 'cause thats when he had it. Joe was not just a pervert but an alcoholic . \n\n\n\n\n\nHe drank everyday and when I suggested him any type of help he said that he DOESNT WANT to recover but intentionally wants to make it worse. But he still complained to me everyday how bad everything is. Joe had found out that he could get attention/worry \u00a0from me when he told me every week that he will kill himself next month and guess what months past and he was still saying 'next month i do it' . I was truly scared for him because to me suicide was a topic I would never make jokes. One of the worst things was when he actually suggested me to kill myself on my birthday!!! And I think he didnt even meant it in a bad way he thought this is actually good thing to do!! I \u00a0was also feeling bad and drank here also he never told me to stop but ENCOURAGED me to drink and self harm. Then the perverted stuff went on he asked me about my bras and wanted me to guess his size...constantly sent me porn and shit. I was REALLY naive and too mentally challenged to notice how sick this is and still thought its an internet friend. I felt uncomfortable the whole time but I was afraid of having no one to write with. Once he ate 36 pills and was like the worst thing to happen will be a coma. I was in constant fear of this 'friend' . Then he got drunk and sent me a picture of a blade and wrote 'Join me'. He literally wanted me to self harm!! Here I said NO because \u00a0 at this time I was \u00a0already recovered I stopped self harming and drinking and all shit like this and mentally cleared up.\n\n\n\n\n After I was better I started realizing what a freak Joe is . Finally! I was thinking how to quit this all but was too afraid still. That freak actually only found it good when I was doing something destructive to myself and he really didnt seem happy about my recovery. A turning point was when he told me about \u00a0his revenge plan for his ex and her baby. After this I started ignoring many of his messages but once I said that I cant concentrate and his reply was : Draw something , write a poem or make sexy pictures and put them on Instagram . This was his last message after this I finally blocked him everywhere possible. We were talking a whole year. This is not even everything that happened. I realized too late that this is NOT okay and that it was grooming. Looking back I honestly have to say this traumatized me and I keep thinking constantly about it.\u00a0", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

We hate these emotions so much that we'll do everything in our power to help others, even strangers not feel that way.\n\nOther times, we are intimidated by our narcs and will do anything to 'keep the peace'.\n\nThere's many other times that I in particular have found that I take on other people's 'tasks'.\n\nAll 'Separation of tasks' entails is a new way of looking at every situation in your life and deciding what is 'your task' and what is 'their task' (ie, not your job to do, not your job to make them do it and most importantly, not your job to worry about it)\n\nSo I've been trying to think of an example but the best one I have is actually from a healthy relationship. If anyone wants me to help or 'assist' them breaking down any situations they're in to your job and their job I will happily take the time to do so.\n\nSo my best friend is engaged to a wonderful man, their relationship has had problems before but they have been going strong and still adore one another. Theres one issue they've been dealing with on and off for a while now, her fianc\u00e9's best friend.\n\nI haven't met his best friend, from what I've heard however, it's not a healthy friendship. This guy expects a lot from him, expecting him to be available a lot to go out drinking. When they go out it's always what his best friend wants, has to have entire control of what happens. Is always telling her fiance in 'subtle' ways how my bestie is controlling him, and implies she isn't good for him.\n\nIt's only recently his best friend has actually started being kind to my bestie, he's now including her in outings rather than using the excuse that it's a lads night even though another is invited and claiming 'she's one of the lads'\n\nHer fiance does see something is wrong, a lot of times he can't be bothered hanging out with them, doesn't want them involved with certain things to do with the wedding but refuses to speak up and complies with everything because 'he wants to keep the peace'\n\nThis has stressed out my bestie so much, she has no idea what to do, it's causing arguments between them.\n\nBefore learning about separation of tasks, I probably would've recommended speaking up for him, talking to his best friend, not having any of it but now I know that my best friend is taking on tasks that her NOT HER PROBLEM.\n\nthe main issue is her fiance won't stand his ground to his best friend. No one on this planet can ever make him do that, he needs the courage to do it.\n\nMy bestie however still believes it's up to her to help him, not realising that trying to help is what's causing stress between them.\n\nI told her this, I asked her why does she believe she needs to take on all this stress, make his job her own. Obviously because she cares, she loves him, hates seeing him being taken advantage of.\n\nI reiterated there's nothing she can do, it'll always be up to him. His best friend clearly has a lot of issues, prob some narc tendencies too which isn't up to her fiance to solve.\n\nIt's clear her fiance is worried about the backlash which I made clear whatever happens isn't his problem, it's his best friend's problem. He's done the same by taking on his best friend's feelings and wants as his own task in an attempt to 'keep the peace' but doesn't realise he's causing more tension in all other relationships by doing this.\n\nI see this so much in disfunctional relationships, one partner making the other take on their tasks so they can't be blamed for it going wrong.\n\nAn example could be your partner needs to be up early for work, they could ask you to make sure they wake up early or to set the alarm for them.\n\nThen they oversleep, and it's your fault. You didn't do their task now they can blame you things going wrong in their life.\n\nSo it isn't up to you to do their jobs, what do you do then?\n\nAll you can do is assist them, for example with the couple, you could help them by setting the alarm for them or by nudging them awake.\n\nBut how's that any any different?!? You ask. The major difference is you accepting that no matter how much you assist them, it'll still always be up to them to do it. You no longer need to feel like you need to make them do it, it won't ever be your fault if they don't wake up, it's always up to them to do it and it's up to them to deal with the fall out.\n\nNow I understand it isn't that simple, I understand in some relationships, if they didn't wake up on time, they'd lash out, maybe even get physically violent. It's horrible, I've been there and at the end of it all I'd sit there and blame myself. I'd ask myself what can I do better, why am I such a terrible partner\n\nI'd spiral our of control with guilt and anxiety, just like they want you too.\n\nWhat I took away from learning about separation of tasks? It was never my fault he or anyone else in my life didn't do what tasks were up to them, no matter how much I help and assisted them, it was always still up to them to do it.\n\nNow I never let it reflect on me, I don't take on other people's problems as my own.\n\nThere's so much more I could write about this but I'd thought I'd give you all an idea first, thank you so much for reading, take care \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I live with 4 other adults, my fiance, our two brothers, and my future brother in law's gf. Brother in law, and his gf needed a place to live. So we were letting them crash temporarily. This was around the time our lease was up. My fiance and I already live with my younger brother, and it's been pretty easy going, house stayed tidy, no conflicts, it was great actually.  My fiance wants to help out his bro, and gf. After many discussions, with and without them, we agreed to find a bigger place and let them come live with us. We all get to save some money splitting the financial costs. Sounds pretty win-win for everyone. \n\nI am now starting to believing the gf to be a narcissist and I do not know what to do about her. But my previously safe space is being infiltrated by her, and I am stuck for the next 10 months in a lease with them, and I'm already loosing my sanity...\n\nEverything was great at first, she helped out with everything around the house, she had no issues following our rules we had in place already. Since, we were nice enough to allow her to come stay too. Communicating with each other about things was a breeze all in all it was a jolly time...\n\nOhhhh how I see how we were all wrong about that... \n\nSince we've been in the new house, I've noticed a shift in her behavior, she started to invalidate everything I say, everytime I  talked about my day, and one upping me on everything, to the point of where I just avoid talking to her now cuz i just feel so shut down after them. She now walks around with this inflated sense of self, like praise me for doing adulting things, I am such a successful adult. She's started isolating our brother from us demanding he spend every moment locked up in their room seperated from us when he's home, and my awesome relationship I had has completely diminished even though we literally live together. She's always Saying she's done things that haven't been done, like washing the floors or keeping the bathroom clean, or taking care of their animals, which 2 of the 3 of them we have here are theirs. Remember, I am home all the time. I see what goes on, what gets done what doesn't. Then when I end up fed up with the mess and cleaning things myself, I've done this about every other week, and I do keep cleaned up after myself and my fiance, and he helps out too when he's not working super late.  Ill mention to her  \"hey, we all live here, next time can you just keep up after yourselves better, and help more with the upkeep, like sweeping, and vaccuming, you guys utilize that space as well, and your dogs shed and create a mess and there is no reason for it to be this dirty and smelly, and I shouldn't have to clean up after everyone.\" \n\nI believed her to be a tidy person since she gloated about it so much before we moved in together when she was crashing with us at the old house it was like she wasn't there she kept pretty tidy after herself, but I think she was disguising how much of a lazy slob she is. \n\nAny time I ask about getting somethings done around the house she is immediately defensive, and proceeds to list all the shit she's done, but I know hasn't been done at all cuz all she does is sit around and help make the mess and let's her dogs chew up everyone's things, I am always doing it.\n\nI am not entirely a clean freak, but the house gets dirty fast with 5 people and 3 dogs.. and I shouldn't be the only on maintaining this.\n\nThen she'll starts to tell me about all the shit I didn't do, to the point where I question if I am actually equally contributing to housework... When I know I am doing much more than what should be expected to do. \n\nFor example, I missed my dish night one week because I spent the 2 days prior cleaning the whole house that was a mess from the dogs, all the other people that live here plus she had friends over and threw a party and they made a nice drunken mess, the house was just gross, it smelled and looked like a frat house. We had also been on vacation the entire week prior to that, left a clean house came back to a dirty one.\nShe said she would get the whole place cleaned up really nice in the next day or two. So I waited 2 days for that, and nothing, she just sat around and slept the whole time. So I just cleaned it myself, to avoid the confrontation... \nShe then tried calling me out for not upholding my dish night. I agree that I should of done my dishes on my night, but I explained once that time came around I was exhausted from spending the two days prior cleaning the entire house after HER party, and the mess from them while we were gone for a week, cuz the house smelled horrid. Mind you I had done all dishes 48 hrs prior on NOT my dish night, and the dishwasher was still loaded with the ones I did before I marathon cleaned the whole house which that night was her dish night. Hmmm.... I brought all this up, and it didn't matter to her.. she completed her task according to her, because she half ass did the dishes and she gave some half assed excuse about work being rough that day, and she missed the clean full dishwasher that she took her dinner bowl out of to eat dinner before she did the dishes...  \nThere was only a few dishes in the sink on my dish night, plus the still full clean dishwasher from the other day when I had done the stacked up dishes previously from her party.  I asked her bf if he wouldn't mind doing an extra pan and some bowls and a couple cups the next day, since I cleaned the entire rest of the house by myself, and it was his day after mine. He said he didn't mind. \nThen she told him to NOT do the dishes because I didn't finish my dishes from my night, and convinced him to not lift a finger until I completed them myself to which he listened and agreed with her. \n\nTo which I ended up completing the dishes like always, cuz they start smelling, and I work and live there, so it's not pleasant... \n\nI've caught her lying about little things, and exaggerating and twisting the truth, constantly.  Her actions and words never line up. And I am getting to the point where I am not sure anymore what's truth and what isn't due to gaslighting, and i am fighting not to believe that I am in wrong like she says I am when we discuss things related to our place, and the responsibilities that come with that... I just want things to be fair...", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He has a friend who is half his age and I\u2019ve never liked it when he spent time with her. Mostly because he talks shit about me with her and parties. Well he\u2019s talked about wanting to do coke again for some time and not too long ago let it slip he had a coke hangover. This past Friday he was a complete prick and ignored me most the day. It turned out he was making plans to party with her and her friends. He always ignores me when they are talking or when he\u2019s over there. He messaged me when he got back home and told me he was horny and I was dumb enough to want him so I went.\n\nI gave him head twice throughout the course of my visit and got him to climax both times. Yeah tmi but it\u2019s important. I didn\u2019t know he did coke. I\u2019m 4 months pregnant with his child currently. I asked him last night after I got back if he did because it tasted funny. Sure enough he did coke again. He only messaged me because he wanted a booty call. He didn\u2019t think for a second me going down on him and swallowing would risk transferring the coke in his system to me. I got him to admit it so I could screenshot it. He\u2019s already threatened custody once when I first found out.\n\nI\u2019ve put up with him refusing to label our relationship so he wouldn\u2019t have to commit to me and I\u2019ve been with him a year. He tells me things like he could do anything he wants with anyone because I\u2019m not his girlfriend. He neglects me. He\u2019s cold to me. When we break up or fight he says the most horrible things to me. He gives me the silent treatment all the time. Tells me everything is all my fault, I\u2019m fucked up and I deserved to be ghosted in my last relationship. I\u2019m too needy and clingy. Never appreciates me for what I do for him. Does not care about me as a person. Who I am what I\u2019ve overcome in my life, tragedies that made me as fucked up as I am. I\u2019m completely empathetic to what he\u2019s been through and accept him for who he is but he\u2019s never given me the same back. Always keeps me at arms length emotionally.\n\nEven after all that I think I\u2019m finally done. Hard drugs is a hard nope for me. I already walked away from a best friend because of meth. I don\u2019t care if he says coke isn\u2019t a big deal. It is to me. I don\u2019t like the way it makes him act. I don\u2019t like that he has a baby coming, is 41 and his priority right now is partying and doing coke with a friend group half his age. I\u2019m tired of how immature he is. I\u2019m tired of how little he cares about my happiness. He\u2019s selfish in bed. Just selfish period. And I\u2019m stuck with him even if I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship because we\u2019re having a baby. I\u2019m terrified of what it will be like to co parent with him. I know one thing. My baby is never going over to his friends house. That bitch will never lay eyes on my kid. I promised him I\u2019d never do what his ex did and take his kid away. But ffs he is doing coke. What the hell am I supposed to do. I don\u2019t want to have 50/50 custody with a coke head.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m the narc or she is. I think she shows a lot of narcissistic tendencies. But then I feel like the way I reacted was also narcissistic. \n\nShe did the whole love bomb, pushing intimacy very quickly (from the first date), mirroring thing. At least I think it was mirroring. We were never in a relationship but she sent a lot of mixed signals. I don\u2019t really know what we were, she told me \u2018doesn\u2019t think she wants a bf\u2019 from the start, but then it was never really defined what it was. She was very confusing, acted totally like a gf, had been wanting a date for months, but then refused to be exclusive in any form at all and would get mad at me if I tried to discuss it. I never did anything wrong to her. All I did was maybe be a little overly keen and text too much. But that\u2019s it. It was obvious I liked her a lot and I felt like she did with me. She even said things like \u2018she missed me\u2019 and I \u2018made her feel safe\u2019.  She told me she wouldn\u2019t tell her parents about guys unless she saw something there, then told her parents. It was very very confusing. She was extremely self obsessed and would tell me all sorts of odd things you shouldn\u2019t really tell someone. \n\nIt came time for me to go back to uni for a few weeks. She had final exams at uni. I did too.  She said she \u2018needed space from me\u2019 while those were going on. I was a little insulted by this and confused as she seemed to really like me. I said okay. 2 days later she tagged me in things on social media then texted me saying good luck. This just drove me into a total confusion and I eventually texted her confessing that I had really fallen for her. I told her she had been so intimate and it seems like she didn\u2019t even care about my feelings at all. She got angry I was pushing the issue and called me \u2018obsessed\u2019 and told me it \u2018made her angry when I texted her\u2019. She said all I talk about is her feelings towards me (we had discussed it a little already) and then ghosted me. I feel like this was narcissistic on my part as I fell for her extremely quickly. But I was just trying to figure out what was going on because I felt she didn\u2019t know what she wanted. She had sent me into a total confusion state. So I literally can\u2019t tell if it was me or not. \n\nI feel awful for pushing at such an important time when we both had finals. But then again, I had them too and telling me that she \u2018needs space\u2019 really just made me feel like a freak. But I never was seriously forcing her into anything. I was just trying to discuss it with her and she claimed it was controlling. I never lost my head until right at the end when she called me obsessed. At which point I told her that I wasn\u2019t obsessed, I just really liked her and was trying to make it work and she wouldn\u2019t hear from me again. I apologised a week later and she just ignored me. I sent 2 more friendly texts after and she ignored both. \n\nI feel like my side of the story sounds like she\u2019s narcissistic, but if someone heard her side it would sound like I\u2019m a crazy narc myself. I don\u2019t know what to think but all I do know is it\u2019s been months and I\u2019m still really struggling with it. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?

It caused me to feel like I was the problem for a long time and really even now I feel that if I wasn't so high-maintenance, she'd be happy and we could actually be like a mother and daughter. I'm also not very emotionally close to her because whenever I've tried to tell her things, she will always minimize my feelings, leading me to feel like my problems don't mean anything because I just needed someone to tell me that everything was going to be fine or at the very least that my concerns were noted but she would just flat out deny that I was suffering.

A few months ago, she vehemently insisted he wouldn't be invited as she believes he is an abusive narcissist and no one is friends with him anymore anyways. Fast forward to this weekend at a friend's gathering - we're in private so I ask her once again to confirm he wasn't invited before I RSVP. Her response was that he wasn't on the A-list, but if not enough people RSVPd as yes he *might*\u00a0be invited...but it was highly unlikely so I had nothing to worry about.\u00a0\n\nSince her response was different from a few months ago and kind of danced around my question, I asked her to just be straightforward and confirm there is now a chance he would attend. Her response was if I didn't want to go to the wedding I could just tell her.\n\nI clarify that I want to be there, but would not go if there was the slightest chance my ex would attend out of consideration for my mental and emotional well being. I make it clear to her that I will still love her no matter what she decides, as it's her and her fiance's day and no one should tell them who they can and can't invite. But I have a right to make my own choices too.\n\nAgain, she tells me if I don't want to be at her wedding to just say so. It was at this point we snowballed into a fight as I yell at her that I was abused and that is the reason I won\u2019t go as I don't want to see him. She accuses me of making her choose between me and my ex (who she doesn't even talk to anymore, so I don't fucking get this at all). She's also mad because I refuse to tell her HOW he abused me and insinuated it was unfair of me to use it as a reason for why I don't want to go. I ran out of the party sobbing as I felt incredibly humiliated and misunderstood.\u00a0\n\nIt's been two days since and I'm still very upset about our confrontation. I don't want to weaponize my traumatic experience against my ex or put it up for judgement by others to deem whether or not I was abused enough. And I really feel like she cornered me into making me choose between the two.\n\nI'm also hurt because several friends from the party, including her fiance (who didn't witness the argument) reached out to see if I was okay the next day. She still hasn't said anything to me. I know she's a busy bride but after our argument and the aftermath (along with many past explosive fights that I ONLY ever experience with her) I am starting to really question our friendship. I'm obviously not attending at this point and I don't think I'm being unreasonable with my decision. But I am questioning if I'm being too hard on her.\u00a0\n\nAm I wrong for not wanting to share my experience but using my abuse as a reason as to why I will not go? Am I being a hypocrite for feeling hurt that she would rather have the option to invite someone she doesn't speak with anymore than to have me, her supposedly \"close\" friend, feel safe at at her wedding? As a side note, my ex HATES the bride. I would never tell her because it's not my business. But it's the cherry on top that really pisses me off.\u00a0\n\nThe other concern I have is a lot of other mutual friends found out that my ex abused me because of this fight (we've been broken up almost 2 years). I've been on the verge of a panic attack since Saturday because I don't know what could happen next. I'm terrified my experience is going to be scrutinized and questioned by more people. I'm scared my hesitation to share my experiences will be twisted around and turned into me not being able to handle rejection. And I'm HORRIFIED at the thought of this coming back to my ex and him either trying to a) apologize or b) retaliate.\u00a0\n\nSo far my other friends have been VERY kind, considerate, and empathetic to my experience and are not pressing me. But I am still so anxious about this leading to more pain and suffering on my end. And I'm also not sure if I'm being too hard on my friend.

I'm interested in anybody's feedback who has been there (gay, straight, whatever!) but I'm particularly interested in anyone who has experienced this in a gay relationship as I think there are sometimes different complexities in these relationships with people who come from families who are not approving of their orientation.\n\nTo start: I recognize that nobody is perfect. I've not been the perfect boyfriend but I've always tried to be. I'm absolutely certain I've done things to hurt him (unintentionally). But I've never cheated on him and I've never, ever gotten as volatile as he gets.\n\nOne concern I've always had is how out of control he gets when he feels slighted in any way. What would be a 10 minute chat with nearly anyone else in my life spirals into an hour sometimes two hour long session where he berates me and tells me that I'm being \"fucking selfish\" and that \"you don't have any friends because you're acting like a little bitch.\" It feels like emotional battery by the time we're done and I am so eager to return our relationship to some sort of normalcy that I will do nearly anything (sometimes apologizing for things I've not done which I know enables him) to make it stop.\n\nI've told him repeatedly that while I know we will have disagreements, I don't want to be spoken to or sworn at. He always shoots back that \"If I hadn't done X,Y,Z, he wouldn't have spoken to me in that manner.\"\n\nTo me, this is a red flag. Another red flag for me is that the outbursts have become more frequent, more nasty and more unhinged. He's never been physically violent, though a month ago when we argued he got so close I thought he was going to hit me, but I know that my relationship is not an emotionally safe space.\n\nLast week, we were going to eat for dinner. He'd exploded in a rage earlier that morning on me and in the evening I was still quiet. He asked what was wrong (he truly doesn't see the way he talks as a problem despite being told over and over again how it impacts me).\n\nWhen he asked me what was wrong, I told him nothing because I knew bringing up the way he spoke to me would result in an emotional outburst so I kept my mouth shut.\n\nAlso last week, he saw me browsing for an Apple Watch as I was thinking of buying myself one. He saw it, said that my birthday was coming up and offered to buy it for me for my birthday. He was caring, loving (in that moment) and wanted to do it.\n\nThe next morning, literally before we got out of bed, he flew into a rage over a very minor disagreement and told me that he wasn't paying for \"the fucking watch\" and that \"I don't need to buy anything for somebody who doesn't respect me.\"\n\nWhen I told him that the watch was already on its way he insisted that I return it or pay him for it. This isn't about the watch for me. It's about the wild behavior. I am returning the watch because I've decided that:\n\na. it's not a gift, it's a handcuff and I don't want it to be hung over me\n\nb. it's not worth the emotional energy of fighting with him over the stupid watch. So I gave in and I am returning it today.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. I don't believe my partner is a terrible person. I see him as having been involved in a lot of trauma growing up (my family is far more accepting of the fact that I am gay than his is). If you've been in this situation, have you managed to move forward recognizing the other person's humanity and feeling for that person while also leaving the relationship? I know I need to protect myself. I also have conflicting feelings about him and wish he'd get help, but he seems reluctant. I know I can't force him. How have you managed to simply move forward?\n2. I have often told myself that if he committed to go to therapy and deal with the really terrible time he had growing up, things could likely be different as he's really caring in other ways. However, he is unwilling to go, sees no problem with the way he speaks, and always blames the wild (and I'd argue abusive) behavior on me. I've told him that I am always willing to listen if I've hurt him in any way and to work toward a resolution but I can't have that conversation if he's screaming at me and telling me I'm a selfish little bitch.\n3. I am in counseling and that's helpful. I want to (at least right now) end this relationship, heal and then I do want to be in a relationship at some point when I figure out how I got myself into this relationship and to figure out firmer boundaries so I don't let this happen again. Has anyone ever struggled with that? I've been in a relationship (a dysfunctional one) for 10 years and I'm nervous about this. I'm not financially dependent on him and we don't have children but I'm still nervous about being single. Then I'm nervous about finding somebody else as I do want--at some stage--to be in a relationship.\n4. How have people begun to heal? I have a small group of friends that I share this with (2 who I really trust) that have been enormously helpful. I also go to counseling. I know I'm not a perfect person but I'm also not the monster he's made me feel like.

I cut the cord about a little over a week ago and I've never felt more free... in control of my life,  aside from the fact, I've been doubting myself and trying to truly understand if I am in the wrong or not. But to my knowledge, this is completely normal. To blame yourself after being in these relationships. \n\nI had tried to go NO CONTACT many times before but they had threatened suicide and I was also very blind. I didn't realize they could ever be a narc. But as I always said, if I was in their shoes, I would never make somebody feel that trapped or be that co dependent to the point of suicide because that is not fair. If someone is not happy with you, please let them go and let them have their peace of mind if you can. If everyone threatened that means we'd all die very young. Not to sound like an ahole... but anyways...\n\nThe covert I dealt with's past relationships consisted of bad break ups. I ignored this because at the time they showed me, they seemed too kind and well headed. Over time, their true colors came out. Being around them in the end actually made me feel ill and out of control because they had no empathy. I hadn't seen them in person for two years because of this. I felt I had to force myself the last times because at the time, I was the only one feeling so sickly about being with them so I thought it'd fade away. The last time ever, they had grabbed my shirt and threw a crying tantrum and I was so uncomfortable I couldn't wait to go home. After I left that time (I couldn't drive and was two hours away from my home), I made it clear I didn't want to come over anytime soon and they could not come over anytime soon.\n\nBut as I said, part of me wants to blame myself... make me feel like me thinking they're covert or a narcissist at all, is in my head and that I'm making them out to be bad when they're not... just as they used to tell me. \"I put ideas into my head\" and they'd stand by that belief ever since I rebelled against them. Just so frustrating to that nobody really knew what the context was of our relationship behind the scenes. To this day. Even after I let them go they claimed I didn't care about their pets, when I love nothing more than animals. If you knew me, you'd understand that. Infact, I even spent a good $200 to animal shelter last Christmas. I have been donating for years. I absolutely love animals everywhere and any kind. One thing I enjoyed was seeing their dog the most in the end. Because I love their dog. I'm not gloating about the money, but I just want to make this clear they are lying through their teeth and tried to get a reaction out of me. Then days, message me saying how they miss me and to not ignore them. I don't know how someone can say such whacky things to try to get a reaction and pretend that I shouldn't be upset or even angry. \n\nI don't believe I'm the narc because I've worried about it. I don't feel like I'm a good person for leaving them alone, and limiting contact in any way I can unless I go on YouTube or read an article to verify I too, relate to the signs or how someone felt going through it... All I want to do is make a positive impact in the world. I've never had issues with anybody for things that they had issues with in this covert relationship.I would never ever make a person feel the way they did me. When they had met me, the things they loved about me... they slowly critiqued and diminished them and I want to get those qualities back but I doubt I can being around someone like that, whether they're a narc or not. I never did that to them, I admit I have had times where I cracked and didn't do the best thing but there was so much build up.\n\nI wanna talk about pretty much anything about Covert here. I want your thoughts on if you think they're a narc. Do you ever blame yourself? I wanna hear your experiences so I make sure I don't doubt myself in the future or look like a fool. \n\nSo I'm just wondering, what are some signs of covert narcissism? Personal experience? Textbook examples?\n\nI feel like narcissism can have cut crease signs but covert? It seems harder to see because these people are fine until you're under their leash and they've slowly tricked you into thinking everything you feel is wrong and you're the problem and sadly, people on the outside don't know who truly is screwing you over and making you ill. Thanks.\n\nUPDATE: \n\nJuly 7th 2019: Thanks everybody who commented!! It really added some insight. I still will read new comments.

He would never put a label on our relationship, but after he trashed me he said that we WERE in a relationship, I was just too concerned with titles. He said \u201cwe spent all our time together, so yeah we were basically in a relationship\u201d\n\nI think he used this to his advantage when I would get upset knowing he was talking to other women. That way he could justify it cuz we weren\u2019t \u201ctogether\u201d . He was ALWAYS lying about it like he wasn\u2019t doing it . Even when the text message was thrown in his face he would still try to find a way to turn it on me like I was nuts. I got upset with him one time over something he had lied about and he said \u201cI\u2019ve heard all about you. You\u2019re crazy.\u201d Him and I had no mutual friends. Lived in totally different towns. Any of my exes who could bad mouth me in any way live nowhere near here so his claim was a joke. I called him out on that and he said I was insane for looking at his phone.  He gave me the pin. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nShortly after he diffused it with his son. He would always tell me how much his son talked about me when I wasn\u2019t there and how much he loved me. He promised me no matter what happened we would always be friends because he didn\u2019t want to break his sons heart.  I told him the moment he started seeing someone else I\u2019d be nothing but a memory to him. He said and I quote, \u201cdude I mean what I say\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s just one of many fights we had where I was gaslighted lied to and manipulated. Didn\u2019t know that was what was going on till I was away from the situation and did some reading.\n\n\nAnytime I talked about emotions, my feelings, or cried he said he made him want to push me away and that he couldn\u2019t \u201chandle\u201d it. \n\nThe last time I ever saw him I was at his house and he was freaking out because in June his rent was going to go up 200 dollars due to new owners. He said he had no money to move and couldn\u2019t afford The rent increase. Fast forward to now and his girlfriend got a brand new house rental that he has now moved into with her. She posted the rent papers on Facebook for all to see. The Rent amount, address and everything. He went from a dumpy 400 a month apartment to a 1,100 a month home. His name is nowhere on that lease. Why? Because he has a criminal history and he wouldn\u2019t have passed the background check. She is essentially sneaking him in there to live. I can promise  it. \n\nI haven\u2019t talked to him since the discard in April, but I found out he moved because I got an email from his power company. I had set up his online account and was paying a majority of that bill. The address is the same as hers on the papers.\n\nMy questions are:\n\nHe was very quick to claim this new girl as his girlfriend. Yet after a year wouldn\u2019t do that for me. Why? Cuz he knew she was successful and could help him get a house to live in? I didn\u2019t live or work in his town so that wasn\u2019t an option for me. \n\nHe\u2019s saying he loves her on her Facebook posts and I was lucky if he did that twice to me the whole time I was with him.\n\nWhat was so different about her than me? Why was she so special? I did everything I could for him. He didn\u2019t like when I called him out on his BS. I was on to his game and that why we fought most of the time toward the end. It was a mess.  \n\n\nI\u2019m trying to get past this but he messed me up so bad that I don\u2019t know where to start.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He said he'd sign a promissory if I'd agree not to testify. He never did. He's ghosted myself and our soon to be 4 year old child ever since the morning he was sentenced. I'm ridiculously trauma-bonded by years of intermittent reward and severe physical and psychological abuse.

I think my husband is emotionally abusive and possibly a narcissist, yet I second guess myself.\n\nI initially suspected this about 5-6 years ago after reading Lundy Bancroft and I realized some of the \"minor\" (not physical) abusive behaviors definitely happened in my relationship. However, I wasnt able to truly process the info at that time bc of subconscious, false beliefs that \"I am not enough\" and cannot survive on my own. Since that time, I have gone to individual counseling, identified those insecurities, and started to trust myself more. \n\nAnyhow, I am often certain that my husband is abusive and possibly a narcissist based on these examples: \n-telling me I am crazy, \n-too sensitive, \n-saying he is not yelling while yelling at me and asking if I want to see \"real yelling\", \n-pinching/poking me in painful ways after I have asked him to stop and saying he is just playing and it doesnt hurt,\n-Interrupting and telling me to HUSH and SHUSH and QUIET when he doesnt want me to speak,\n-Coming home angry after work and barking orders at me like \"open the door\" and \"turn on the light\",\n-making me feel like a bad, unreliable person bc I have occasional back pain, but then when I confronted him about how that hurt me, he insisted he has only shown complete empathy for my pain,\n-most recently, moving to a new \"cool\" city in 2 weeks without me, after I told him I couldn't sign a lease there bc I am unhappy in our marriage and cant leave my secure job and homebase until our marriage has improved and I asked him to delay the move by 3 months while we worked on these things (his response was basically that he didn't care if I stayed in our current city, he is still going with or without me in 2 weeks, and I broke a promise and did not follow through with our plan)\n\nWhen I see the list above, I am pretty certain he is abusive, but when I try to discuss it with him and explain that the behaviors are directly out of the textbooks, he has good rationale that makes me second guess myself. For example:\nexample:\n- textbooks are wrong\n- I have not shown him affection for years, and what must that do to a person\n-I AM crazy and too sensitive sometimes\n-I find one small example that happened once in 5 years and then fixate on that and paint him as a monster\n-everyone engages in these behaviors\n-my counselor has instilled false ideas in my mind\n-he refuses to have abuser as part of his image\n-I have been abusive to him (which is true, I have yelled and I have hit him, which I cannot believe I have done and wish I hadnt)\n-he is happy except when he is around me. I am miserable to be around and so he might act out bc of it. (I agree, I have been angry and resentful toward him and not pleasant to be around.)\n\n\nAnd he just agreed to go to marriage counseling with me (which I have been asking about for months, despite knowing the evidence says its not wise to do with an abuser). He also said that if we get divorced he will pay me back the approx $30k-$40k that I have paid to his student loans and the divorce would be amicable and he doesnt want any of my money (he just graduated and will soon be starting a job making 2x my income). Also, neither of us deserve to be in a toxic relationship. \n\nWell, I had been SO CERTAIN that he is abusive, and I deserve better. But now that he is being kinder and somewhat hearing me and rationalizing and denying the behaviors, I am questioning myself and uncertain. Is he not abusive? Have I labeled him wrong? Am I the abuser and narcissist and delusional one? Would I regret ending my marriage? Are his behaviors really not that bad and the pros of my marriage outweigh the cons?

As you start \"thinking\" you can label a thought \"worry\" or \"anxiety' and allow that thought to float away.\n\nThe same with abuse and your daily life. When you find yourself doing behaviors that only make sense because you were abused- label it abuse and try a different behavior. \n\nFor example: When you find yourself not feeling like you should take a seat in a coffee shop because you don't feel like your body deserves to take up space- label that thought \"abuse\" and take a seat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne method I've used is to call out the abuse. Try to not process it too much and then try to ACT in opposition of what my abuser was controlling me to do. In the above example, I would feel ashamed for wanting to take up space- so when I notice that I take a seat and don't apologize for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember honestly thinking I was going to die and also that it was too painful to keep trying anymore. It's totally worth the pain to figure this shit out. I know it's painful and honestly that pain is an indicator that you are a strong, resilient and mindful human being that is going to conquer this shit. I promise you that. Keep writing. The mods on here are so smart. Go through and read their comments- they are wise old owls.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a lot of confusion in recovery - no- you are not the abuser. all of that confusion was designed by the abuser. It's terribly hard to see while you are in it- but layers and layers will fall away and one day you'll wake up and not feel so terrible. One day you will wake up and actually have motivation. One day you will laugh at how childish your ex narc was. I promise, they will seem small, scared and like a child that just needed to throw a tantrum over and over again. The reason you can't see it now is your brain needs to heal. Let it. Give yourself as much time as you can, as much love as you can. Build yourself a cocoon of love and get in that shit and swaddle and love yourself by any means necessary.\n\nYou are beautiful and worthy of love. I promise you. Right now I'm sure you questioned it, that's the abuse. When you find yourself not accepting love, label it abuse and do your best to let the love in. You are worthy of love.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople are going to try to love you the real &amp; correct way before you are ready and you are going to try to love people before you are healed. I honestly think this is part of life- and it's damn OK. Take all the love, try to let it in. Try to feel it. It's going to hurt and feel weird because you've been convinced there is a trap or feeling good for a second means you'll be punished later. That's the abuse.\n\nWhen it feels like you can start loving again, start small. Those little succulent plants are ready for your kind words, the soft skin on your hands is pretty great right? The shower feels warm and amazing- say it out loud. All of this will cultivate gratitude and this will melt some of the stuck places. let yourself feel stuck and get unstuck. It's a messy process but you deserve it and the mess is beautiful and you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\na couple last things. don't engage .. breathe.\n\ncreate a ton of space where you can have feelings but don't need to act on them. maybe this is a journal or meditation or a close friend  that listens. maybe it's this subreddit. it helps to have some space.\n\ntalk about safety. what do you need? start asking for what you need out loud. do you need more sleep? do you need the window down? take up some space, my friend.\n\nwhen the feelings come up, practice letting them all the way up and out without an apology. imagine there is a blob of shit stuck in you and each time you allow something to come up and out, that blob gets smaller. You don't know how much is left, but you welcome some crap coming out when it decides to. It's softness with yourself. So when the discomfort arrives, say hi- \"hello bullshit feels of insecurity left over from my abuse\" - try to smile at it. it's part of you that you used to survive.. but now you can let it go. let it come out in whatever emotional release it wants to be. crying, singing at the top of your lugs, running, dancing, writing. then let it go without apologizing for feeling something real and hard.\n\nthere- you did it. you fucking rock star.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nwhere ever you are right now, I'm proud of you for hanging in there.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

As expected this didn\u2019t turn out well in the long run for me as mother got custody of me.\nFor over a decade I\u2019ve been emotionally and verbally abused by my \u201cmother\u201d. \nOver the years I have called my mom \u201cmother\u201d as an inside insult. I use it as a short for mother fucker. \nMother could always flip her mood on a dime. \nOne moment she is a saint, the next she is the devil. \nOut in public we were the best prevailing family ever but behind it all it was hell. \nSure I\u2019ve had those good moments but they were far and few and were always overshadowed by the bad. As if doing something nice would help make it all better and balance out the good and bad in my life. \nWhen she wasn\u2019t at work, hanging out with whatever boy toy she hooked up with at the time, or in her \u201cgood mood\u201d I was called an idiot, lied to and then was called a lier in turn for the simplest things and punished for it. \nAt one point in my life she stated that if I ever were to try and hurt her she would put a bullet in my head. \nThe \u201cboyfriends\u201d she had were not better. \nThey would make me feel like shit same as mother. They would say thinks like I haven\u2019t done enough as my SINGLE MOTHER\u2019S son to support her and other things to demoralize me.\nEvents like this happened for at least 3-4 times a week for years until I finally moved to live with my dad later.\nMore than once I had convinced myself that my mother must me telling the truth about me. \nWhy else would my mother of all people tell me how worthless I am and how much of a shitty person I am if it wasn\u2019t true?\nAs a result of the built emotions over the course of a month at a time I tried to take my own life in a variety of ways which included suffocation, attempting to find my mother\u2019s 9mm to put one in my skull, hanging with random things I used to create a noose, almost everything my small middle schooler, and later high schooler, mind could think of. \nThe only reason I\u2019m still alive is because my friends, who talked me down, and my faithful cat, who had been with me since day one of my life. \nShe would meow, rub her head on me, or lay on me as if silently telling me it will be ok. \nMother had used Daisy, my cat, as an anchor for me to stay, to keep me from running as I had tried many times before. \nShe would try and, literally, kick my cat out the door when I would try to run stating that if I ran there would no reason to keep Daisy around any longer.I feared what would become of the one living thing I truly trusted, so I stayed. \nOver they years I would look over in envy at other families with a loving mother who would play with their children or show them around a amusement park. I\u2019ve always wondered what it would be like to live as a happy family.\nOne without pain or yelling or wondering if the next day your only truly loyal family would be gone the next. \nThe last event was my mother kicking me out of the house after I attempted to defy her which resulted in a my possessions being thrown, things being thrown at me, being hit, and a multitude of different things which made it a very long night to the point I stayed at a neighbors house, praying that Daisy would still be there when I got back.\nMother banned me from turning to my most loving family members for aid, who had practically raised me in the place of my mother. \nSo I turned to my father. \nMother kept telling me how much worse it was going to be with him than her but it didn\u2019t matter if I liked it or not, I had no choice. \nHe was the only person I had left. \nI could only assume she wanted to kick my ass out on the streets with no support of any kind. \nMy dad had raised his own family, that I would visit for VERY short periods of time due to visitation dates and the like so I have a loose idea of what it was like there, while I was dealing with my broken end of it all. \nUnknown to me at the time he had been sending child support money for years. \nIt made sense that money went to my mother instead of me.\nIt was to fund college and have some cash to fall back on as a kick starter but no. she used the money filled her damn closet with new bags, shoes, and anything else she could get her fucking hands on that was expensive and flashy. \nWhen I moved out mother denied me half of my items to take with me so my, already dwindling, possessions were cut in half. \nI, of course, took the my cat Daisy with me and anything else I could with me to the plane as I feared I wouldn\u2019t see any of the items I left behind again. \nLuckily my grandmother, one of the few people I trust in my life, oversaw the shipment of the remaining personal possessions I had chosen to bring with me.\nAs I went though my life I immediately saw improvement. My grades rose sharply from the D average to the AB honor roll, my mood improved from my secluded and shy behavior to being more open. \nBut it isn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows. \nI still have night terrors, nightmares you can\u2019t wake up from as you are stuck in a limbo like state between awake and asleep, episodes where I relapse my past and hunker down in a corner or lay in bed where I\u2019d cry myself to sleep, and I have difficulty trusting others as I fear they ware just playing me to use me for their own hidden agenda. \nI\u2019m now out of high school, enlisting in the Army as a infantryman, and leaving soon for basic training.\n\nAs for one of the most frequent questions I get from telling this story to friends I trust with my life, I cannot sue her for all she has done to me as that would be too much effort and money that won\u2019t give me back the childhood I lost and that would be a deterrent on my enlistment process.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

They had that pattern of thoughts inside of them for a long time, they cannot change by promising you that they will. First of all, they made a promise because they were hurt, they did not want you to leave ( not because they love you genuinely, because of their ego).  Second of, if they really knew the weight of their actions, they would step aside, think through it, and seek help, since it takes yeeears to take responsibility for their words/actions/behaviour without making excuses because that's what they do all the time, remember?  It is because you did this, I did that, it is because I have anger issues, it is because my parents did this to me as a child.    \n\n2. You cannot help them by being a good person, supporting, hugging, telling them everything will be okay, being there for them with their outbursts; this will only acknowledge that their behaviour is acceptable, that they are okay and normal. You are creating an opposite effect, instead of helping them realize they have a problem( WHICH IS NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY), you are minimizing it.   \n\n3. If you are questioning yourself, constantly. If you cannot even think for yourself anymore because you are scared that something is wrong with you.  If you feel like you are not normal because you cry so much, why are you so weak etc,  YOU NEED TO LEAVE. You are not weak, you are not too sensitive, it is your body giving you warnings and begging you to leave.   \n\n4. Listen to your body;  do you have that big ball in your chest? suffocating you? and then the fear kicks in, and you cannot see your way our.? You are so deep into questioning your decisions, that leaving also seems confusing, especially if your are feeling guilty.  You need friends and family AND TRUST YOURSELF. You knew from the first hour of pain what you had to do, do not ignore yourself, you obviously are not receiving what you want and need, listen to your body, and if your mind is all over the place, that is also a sign.   \n\n5. DO NOT BE AFRAID TO LEAVE. LEAVE. It will hurt, it will be hard to breathe, it is like a drug existing your body, and then, after that, A BEAUTIFUL FEELING. It's like giving birth to your new self :P  I have went through it,  allow yourself a period, to cry, grieve, be angry, a mess, and then, let go of that,  let love and kindness enter your body again. Love people, love yourself, forgive.   \n\n6.  Forgiveness?  Please forgive yourself, it can happen to anyone, literally anyone, do not regret loving someone and trying to help someone be a better person.  The only difference now is to learn how to see who is actually worthy of you, and who is not, that's all.   \n\n7. EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY, YOU WILL BE HAPPY  YOU HAVE TO GROW OUT OF THIS PERIOD, IT WILL BE SCARY BUT IT WILL BE SO LIBERATING. YOU WILL BE PROUD OF YOURSELF AND THEN YOU WILL LAUGH AT HOW SCARED YOU WERE ABOUT EXPERIENCING IT BECAUSE YOU WERE STRONG ALL ALONG, STH JUST PUSHED YOU FORWARDS, LIKE LEARNING TO SWIM, YES IT IS SCARY BUT JUST GO WITH THE FLOW AND KEEP SWIMMING &lt;3  \n\n8.

Even in the perfect beginning few years, though, the red flags I didn\u2019t see, or didn\u2019t want to see, or misunderstood, or ignored are all too apparent, one of them being him ruining my birthdays. \n\nThe first year he didn\u2019t overtly \u201cruin\u201d it, but he \u201cforgot\u201d it altogether, and it was very deliberate. Given that was the VERY beginning of our entire relationship, I get very excited about my birthdays and that one was my first birthday away at college/on my own so I made a big deal of it. When the day came he didn\u2019t act like he even knew it was my birthday but he had to have known, and kind of found it funny he forgot. I brushed it off and held him to no blame because it was a new relationship.\n\nThe second birthday I spent with him was my 21st. We were living together in our own apartment and engaged and I wanted to throw a party. I was super hyped about turning 21, of course. He didn\u2019t like that idea because he didn\u2019t want a bunch of people over at our place or risk getting a noise complaint, so I settled with just having one of my close friends over to watch a movie and drink wine. My ex wasn\u2019t drinking and my friend and I were very drunk and just being typical drunk girls laughing at stuff and he made my friend to go home before it was even 10PM on a weekend. I was a little bummed, but I thought it made sense at the time somehow. Leading up to my birthday he was showing me extravagant gifts and asking me what I\u2019d like and getting me excited about some big grand gift. I made light-hearted jokes about him not forgetting this year and he seemed to laugh along with me. On the day of my birthday, I woke up excited and nervous and happy, only for the whole day to go by with no acknowledgement from him. At dinner that night, I felt like a brat, but I finally brought up the fact that he had obviously forgotten again. He wasn\u2019t doing the cute thing where he pretended to forget and then ended up throwing me a surprise party or something, he \u201cforgot\u201d (and by \u201cforgot,\u201d I mean he once again clearly knew it was my birthday and chose to ignore it and make me feel bad, at the time I thought it was actually forgotten though) AGAIN. He got defensive and a little mean and said that he didn\u2019t forget, he was just waiting for the right time to tell me happy birthday, and was angry with me for thinking he forgot. What??? What does that even mean?? Word sad much?? I realized at that moment too that meant that he hadn\u2019t gotten me a gift. It\u2019s not at all that I was mad about him not buying me something, I was mad that he dangled exquisite jewelry and gifts and vacations in my face and then \u201cforgot\u201d?? For the second year in a row? I literally just wanted him to tell me happy birthday. I didn\u2019t want fancy gifts or nice dinner, just kindness and love. \n\nThe third and last year was definitely the worst. We were in the middle of a terrible rough patch where I hadn\u2019t quite figured out he was a narc yet but I had recognized the evil in him and called him out for being abusive once his mask totally slipped and paid for it dearly every day. I didn\u2019t get my hopes up for my birthday at all, which made me sad seeing as every year before I got so excited. I didn\u2019t expect him to remember again so I didn\u2019t even mention wanting to go anywhere or make plans. He actually did, though. The day before, he told me he made reservations for us at our favorite out-of-town fancy restaurant that we only went to a few times a year. This kind of gave me hope, honestly, because I saw it as effort that he put forth without me begging for him to be nice. The day of my birthday, since I was being optimistic, I didn\u2019t want to chance him forgetting and so when we woke up I exclaimed happily \u201cit\u2019s my birthday!\u201d to which he I enthusiastically told me happy birthday. He asked me kind of annoyed if I still wanted to go out to eat, and of course I did. I was getting over the flu and felt pretty terrible, but I spent all afternoon getting dolled up and ready when I previously hadn\u2019t felt like moving. He didn\u2019t make any effort to look nice or acknowledge that I was dressed up, so I got somewhat sad, but off we went to the restaurant. When we got there, it was totally packed and I recognized a panicked look on his face. I knew something had gone wrong. He gave the hostess his name for the reservation he had called in, and it became apparent he did not call for a reservation. Unsure if this time he forgot or he chose to not do it, but either way he wasn\u2019t planning on me knowing that and was trying to fake it, again dangling something nice I couldn\u2019t have in front of me. The hostess was clear there weren\u2019t any more tables but they have one outside table they could serve us at if we really wanted (VERY cold September night) and I said no, since I was sick that wouldn\u2019t be a good idea but we appreciate it, to which he insisted since he drove all the way here we eat there. So, we sat outside in probably 45 degree weather while my chest was still rattling and I still had a small fever probably from the flu. I wanted to take photos of our night out and he got pissy about it and wouldn\u2019t let me. He didn\u2019t have anything to say to me all dinner and when we got home he went to bed and turned his back to me. \n\nMy birthday is still a few months away, but I\u2019m already nervous. As you can probably guess, most holidays went similar. He ruined them all and made it my fault. I\u2019m still adjusting to my life without him. Leaving him saved my life. I\u2019m around 200 days no contact and not looking back. I\u2019m just thinking now how much I am already downplaying my birthday and not wanting to do anything for it because I don\u2019t want to get excited and then be let down. I don\u2019t have it out of my head yet that I\u2019m a bitch or a brat for wanting to have a fun birthday and be appreciated on my birthday. I tried to hard to make his birthdays a huge celebration, and I always seemed to mess that up too. He messed me up so bad I don\u2019t even know how to feel about my own birthday.

We have not had contact since the day he left. Although he has stalked me in many different ways. I am doubtful that he will ever come out and hover me as I demasked him during the last blow out over his cheating and triangulation of a younger prettier version of myself (co-dependant, low self-esteem, physically pleasing). He is also a sex addict that gets a high from cheating and keeping it a secret) The young girl he is with now is the same girl he triagulated me with however they broke up for a year and she moved towns to get away from him. She reached out to me to give me validation that he had treated her the same way he had treated me and we got somewhat close talking about our abuse. I felt like I was healing for the first time. That I wasnt crazy and that what I went through wasnt for nothing. But then I started seeing posts on her social media that led me to believe they were talking again. Sure enough within a few days of seeing that post she had removed me as a friend and was back with him. When that happened it was like I was back at step one trying to move on. I know I need to see someone because im starting to think I'm a narcissist with how I go back and forth between wanting to forgive him and wanting him to drop dead.

I'm looking for advice on how to support her through making the best decisions for herself. \n\nI am an involved uncle to my brother's daughters. Their parents split up while the girls were young, and he and I lived together for some years while he got back on his feet. During this time, I grew very close to my nieces, and now that they've reached adulthood, we've become drinking buddies and remain close.\n\nI have varying degrees of closeness with each niece, and the one in the abusive relationship is the one with whom I am the least close. She can be cagey and distant, but is responsive to affection and expressions of love. I only mention this because it factors into just how forward I can be with her.\n\nMy niece -- let's call her Jane -- is in an abusive relationship with Alan. Jane and Alan have been together for several years and have experienced a handful of breakups and make-ups over those years. She's become pregnant and aborted twice with Alan. Her older sister, Jessica, has lived with her for their entire adult lives and has expressed to me her concerns with Jane and Alan. Specifically, Alan has violent tendencies and has, on at least one occasion, arrived at their apartment drunk, banging on doors and windows, demanding to see Jane.\n\nJessica has tried moving house with Jane on the sly in the past, going so far as to demand that Jane never tell Alan where they live, but that lasted a few weeks the first time, and a few days the last time. Jessica has valid concerns about her safety and Jane's safety, as well.\n\nThe most recent episode was on Jane's birthday, where Alan spent the day fighting with and upsetting Jane about a camping trip she took with another sister, her fiance, and the fiance's \\[male\\] friends. Alan is jealous and possessive and is accusing Jane of flirting with one of the friends because that friend tagged Jane in an Instagram post. They broke up but are again back together.\n\nLast night Jessica asked for me to intervene, and is asking me to leverage the guest list for my upcoming wedding to \"un-invite\" Alan. This is not the tact I am going to take. It is a manipulative and controlling act, and that's not what Jane needs.\n\nJane is a sweet, quiet, and caring woman and deserves happiness. I feel compelled to act, but don't want to do it in the wrong way. I want to be involved but have to tread lightly.

In the very end when I started calling him out on his lies and behavior he told me that  he always loved her more than me. This is just classic narcissism right?

They never quite know if they\u2019re good enough in your eyes, and they never quite know if they\u2019re making you happy.

For anyone who actually reads this, thank you so much in advance. I\u2019ve never shared this before. Any feedback is so greatly appreciated*\n\nSalutations. \n\nI\u2019ve want to open up and finally share my survival story in an appropriate forum. As many of you know, the lingering effect of the narcissist on one\u2019s psyche, even after going no-contact, is very real and can be hindering on one\u2019s ability to more forward. Friends and family only grant so much leeway before a survivor then has to find their own coping mechanisms, to heal seemingly alone and in silence. It shouldn\u2019t have to be that way. I\u2019m having some trouble with some of these lingering effects, even though it\u2019s been almost four years since I made the choice to live. Without further ado, here it goes: \n\nWhen I was twenty (2006) I met my future nightmare (a man fourteen years my senior) at a Memorial Day barbecue. He and two others were the new bosses of my boyfriend at the time. I didn\u2019t want to go to the gathering, but I did anyway to be supportive of my guy and his new job. \n\nMy attention was immediately drawn to a very handsome man in a dark blue shirt. High cheekbones, intense green eyes, tawny complexion. One New York \u201cH\u2019you doin\u2019?\u201d later and I felt like Cupid punched me in the face. I couldn\u2019t get that guy out of my head after that. \n\nI\u2019d never felt animal-magnetism like that in my life. I\u2019m not proud of it, but we fairly quickly found an excuse to see each other and shortly thereafter, he and I started having an affair. It was tawdry, romantic and surreal. We saw each other in secret on and off (my guilt would consume me for a while and I would stop talking to him) for almost a year before things came to a head and my boyfriend broke up with me. A few months after that, my affair and I started officially dating. \n\nHe always impressed me with little things: sneaking away to buy me flowers, giving me little trinkets that he\u2019d collected that always had a story behind them, writing inscriptions in books and giving them to me as gifts, taking me to fancy dinners, always being tidy, lining the floor with candles and rose-petals before my visits. There was always a \u201cmeaning\u201d to everything and we were the center of this exquisite love story.\n\nHe always seemed to know me. Sometimes, I felt like he knew me better than I knew myself. He would tell me that I was a beast and hadn\u2019t discovered my powers yet. He said that I was the most beautiful woman that he\u2019d ever been with. He told me that my looks got him, but my brain kept him. He treated me like something special, something precious, something unique. It was just how I\u2019d always imagined being loved would feel. \n\nUnexpectedly, during the summer we finally got together, he almost lost his sister to an overdose after his Grandmother died. In order to break the news to me that he was going to have to move back to New York for a time,  he surprised me by renting a very nice suite at a downtown hotel. After a very expensive dinner, he took me back to that suite. He didn\u2019t say a word, but walked over to the windows and opened the heavy drapes. He placed a chair in front of the window and took my hand. He undressed me in front of that window. He kissed me and extended my arms outward, facing my naked body to the world outside and whispered to me \u201cLet them see. Let them see how beautiful you are. And you\u2019re all mine.\u201d He made love to me on that chair in front of the window, unabashedly and fearlessly. He was like a drug and I was hopelessly addicted to the rush.\n\nI cried when he left. I talked to him everyday. I felt empty without him. I filled my days with work and friends as best I knew how and one day in September, I got the phone call. \n\u201cI love you and I wanted to move back. But, if I do that, we\u2019re doing this my way.\u201d What he meant was that I had to agree to move in with him if he moved back. In spite of my intense feelings, I felt reticent for a number of reasons: We hadn\u2019t dated that long, we got together under fairly unkind and  immoral circumstances, the age difference, etc.  But, it was no use. I suggested that he get an apartment for a while, just until we were sure about being together, but he said he was already sure about what he wanted and his moving back was contingent on my compliance. I folded.\n\nHe told me to start apartment hunting and to send him info on whatever apartment I wanted. I found the cutest little yellow townhouse and before I knew it, he\u2019d contacted the landlord. \nHe was making preparations to move back and I was getting things together for the move in. After he got back, it was like living in a dream.\n\nThe weeks following were so happy. We picked out dishes and curtains. We didn\u2019t have a lot of furniture, but our house was cute and it was ours. We had a balcony that faced the sunset and a working fireplace. We drank coffee on Sunday mornings and played chess. It almost seemed too good to be true. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t but a few weeks before the little things started. We were in the kitchen one day. He was doing dishes and I was cooking. A cat plate was on the floor from breakfast that morning. He picked it up and rinsed it and appeared to be finished cleaning it. I joked with him \u201c I knooooow you\u2019re gonna use soap on that plate.\u201d He threw the plate in the sink and screamed \u201cGod damnit, I know how to wash a fucking plate!!!\u201d I was honestly stunned. I\u2019d never seen him get angry. We\u2019d never had a fight. He opened the refrigerator and pulled out a beer and opened it, storming past me. \n\nBut, that was just a fluke, right? \n\nThe little things. I had a collection of \u201clittle things\u201d. Incidents for which there were no explanations. I\u2019d put my keys down somewhere. He\u2019d move them. I wouldn\u2019t be able to find them and he\u2019d proudly give them to me with a \u201cwhat would you do without me?\u201d\nHe started having problems at his work. He wanted to drink...\n... everyday. \nI didn\u2019t drink much before I met him (I grew up with an alcoholic parent) but it became the norm for us to imbibe daily. When he drank, he got mean. It would start with \u201cYou were checkin\u2019 that guy I weren\u2019t you?\u201d when we were out at a bar. It didn\u2019t matter what I said, because I was always in the wrong. He would run me in circles until I admitted fault to something that I knew I didn\u2019t do, just to make it stop. \n\nI guess I justified this behavior because he always did something sweet and reconciling afterwards. He\u2019d write a letter or a card, he\u2019d cook me dinner, buy me lingerie, always some grandiose gesture. He would apologize, but with the knowledge that his behavior was triggered by something that I did so essentially, it wasn\u2019t his fault. I always accepted this reality, because in truth, it was the way I could return to my fantasy. \n\nThe first night he assaulted me will be a night I\u2019ll never forget. Strangely, I remember the first time and the last time very clearly, but even after four years, the other memories are fuzzy and buried. Those \u201clittle things\u201d remind me though, at unexpected times.\n\nWe\u2019d had plans to have a special night together. I was at work all day looking forward to this special couple\u2019s night. We were going to go out dinner, go out for drinks, spend time downtown, maybe gamble, maybe another steamy suite-night, you know, the works. When I came home, I found my partner and his/our friend drunk and out of their minds on mushrooms. I was so angry. I was beyond angry. I\u2019d never lost my temper in front of him, but I was so hurt and I felt so betrayed. I screamed. I grabbed a few things, packed my cats into their carriers and drove to my family house, a few miles away. \n\nI waited.\nSilence.\nI waited some more.\nNothing.\nI started to feel sheepish.\nNothing.\nMaybe I overreacted?\nNothing.\nI started to panic- maybe he wouldn\u2019t love me anymore after this?\nNothing.\nNo one is going to love me if I screw this up.\nNothing.\nIt\u2019s all your fault, M.\nNothing\n(Go home and apologize)\n\nI hung my head and went home. I found him basically where I left him, with his/our friend still there. When I realized that he felt no remorse and essentially had ignored that I left, I got angry again. So I started yelling...\n... again.\nI assumed that since the friend was present, he wouldn\u2019t hurt me, although he had intimidated me into believing that he would many times prior. I sorely misjudged.\n\nI was at the top of our staircase yelling at him when he finally did it. He smacked me. He smacked me hard across my cheek. Left a nice, sizeable bruise. Then he grabbed me and threw me into the doorway of our spare bedroom. He almost put me out a second story window with that throw. I whipped around and pushed him into the wall, giving me just enough time to make it to the bottom of the stairs. I ran downstairs and started gathering more of my things. I heard our friend trying to placate us into calming down, but it was far too late. \n\nHe managed to get me by the back of the shirt, ripped my shirt while throwing me over our sofa. I reared up and screamed at them to get out. Thankfully, our friend grabbed him and shoved him into his truck. \n\nThey got arrested outside of a bar later that night. I slept with a barricaded door. \n\nSomehow, I made all of this okay in my head. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have yelled at me.\u201d he stated matter of factly, but he consented that he\u2019d gone \u201ca little overboard\u201d with the drinking/mushrooms. We reconciled.\n\nHe didn\u2019t drink for a while after that. I thought I fixed everything.\n\nMarch of 2009, my Grandfather died. Things stayed calm through sympathy. By September of 2009, we left our town house to move into the other side of my Grandparent\u2019s house to help look after my Grandmother after his passing. \n\nThe little things kept happening. Verbal abuse here, physical abuse there, deep-mental abuse in-between, but it always seemed like an \u201cisolated thing\u201d and as he explained it, it ALWAYS related to something I did to him first, therefor his behavior was null and void. I always accepted this. I accepted this every time he hit me. I accepted this every time he yelled at me. I accepted this when he told me what to wear or what not to. I accepted this when he isolated me from my parents and manipulated my Grandmother against me.  I accepted this when I made up lies for my injuries. I accepted this when he alienated me from my friends. I accepted this every time he convinced me to do something I wasn\u2019t comfortable with, like a drug, or a drink or another person I had to welcome into my bed and do things with that I didn\u2019t want to do. I accepted this when he offered me to his friends. I accepted this when he got angry afterwards. I accepted this at every moment that the cycle continued, but we\u2019ll get to that.\n\nWe got engaged 9/8/2009. He opened a new business with a new partner. He opened a shop. It was exciting. For a while, everything was good. Everything seemed promising and back on track. Sure, he was belittling sometimes and made jokes at my expense, but that was just his sense of humor. Sure, he assumed and made inferences about me, questioned my fidelity, but he was under a lot of pressure.\nI grew up with an abusive, alcoholic parent, so on some level, this all seemed \u201cnormal\u201d. He \u201cnormalized\u201d these things anyways.Then, things got even more complicated.\n\nOn some level, deep in my head and heart, I always knew there was something wrong with our relationship, but I didn\u2019t want to believe it. I didn\u2019t want to be wrong. I didn\u2019t want that fantasy that seemed so real to be nullified by reality. I buried the logical voice that was screaming at me to get out and I told myself everything would be perfect if I could just hold on. If just \u201cthis\u201d was right or \u201cthat\u201d was different, everything would resolve and go back to the way that it was once.\n\nI started complaining about him being gone all the time. He was either at work or at the bar with his business partner. (He\u2019d started drinking again with the birth of the new business.) His partner was a known adulterer and wannabe womanizer. Four kids by three different women, child-support law-suits, etc. I was worried about his influence and of course, every step of the way, each late night no call was blamed on this other guy, and I bought it. Suspiciously, but I bought it all. He started encouraging me to hang out with another mutual friend of ours to fill my time and I suppose, to get me off of his back. This is where things got really complicated. \n\nI\u2019m a classically trained pianist. I missed making music with people, as I\u2019d left the music industry to work in veterinary medicine. One of the surprises that my guy gave me was a piano after I hadn\u2019t had one in five years. (Like I said, his romantic gestures were grandiose.) He suggested that I get together with a musician friend of ours to work on music. I was suspicious of the suggestion at first because our friend was an extremely attractive, talented man, and frankly the whole suggestion seemed like a weird setup. He kept pressing the issue and in order to seem \u201csecure in my relationship\u201d, I consented. \n\nI didn\u2019t want it to be, but it was great. He was beyond great. We met every Thursday to play Bach\u2019s Toccata and Fugue in D min (Dracula theme, also in Fantasia) He\u2019s a banjo/guitar/sitar player who doesn\u2019t read music well, so he started learning with me by ear on the banjo. The most visceral memory I have from the experience was listening to the sympathetic vibrations between the banjo and piano and watching his hands fly over his frets. I was touched. We spent a lot of time together with my guy too who strangely always took this slightly imposed paternal role over both of us when the three of us were together. \n\nThe banjo player was above all else, dripping with kindness and gentility. Every time we were together, I felt this relief, this warmth that I didn\u2019t feel at any other time. Each time we saw one another, that got harder and harder to swallow/ignore, because the glaring reality was that I felt something that I wanted with my banjo player that I didn\u2019t have with my guy. No amount of pretending or pretense could fabricate what didn\u2019t exist between my guy and I.   There were no eggshells, no accusations, no slaps, no punches, no insults, just goodness. Squishy, wonderful goodness. It felt like a warm hug each time I would see my banjo player and it felt cold when he would leave. It was more insightful than I wanted it to be. \n\nWe flirted innocently. We made music. We drank coffee. We ate Indian food after every practice session. We enjoyed our time together. We discussed philosophy, theology, political science, music theory, history, poetry, you name it. He became my closest friend, so quickly that it scared me. I got complacent and became too comfortable in the juxtaposition between my \u201cspecial friend\u201d and my partner.\n\nOne night, my banjo player and I got into a conversation. I don\u2019t really know how it happened, but someone brought up being attracted to the other. It felt electric, almost painful, and every feeling I\u2019d been carrying came bubbling to the surface. I know that we admitted aloud that night that it was taking all of our self control not to touch one another. We didn\u2019t touch each other. I announced my loyalty to my guy. I told my banjo player that I knew my guy could be the guy I needed him to be if I worked harder for him. My banjo player loved him too so accepting this seemed the logical thing. I admitted to feeling guilty. We agreed that we wouldn\u2019t talk about it or tell my guy, because we had no intention of doing anything in any event. He was living with his gf at the time and me with my guy. Why would we rock the boat. (He also didn\u2019t know that I was terrified of what my guy would do to me if he found out) \n\nMy banjo player and I decided to keep meeting to play Bach and drink coffee. I felt a little forlorn, but I thought that I would get over in it time. In truth, I felt like I didn\u2019t deserve a guy like my banjo player. I didn\u2019t believe that I deserved that connection because I\u2019d already hurt another person in order to be with the guy that I was already with. I was tainted. I deserved everything I got from my guy. \n\nThen my guy sniffed me out.\n\nI was in the shower one night when he went through my phone. I\u2019d kept an old, flirty text message from my banjo player and he found it. It should\u2019ve been deleted, but every time I read it, it made me feel good and I was attached to it. I was attached to the thought that this other person, whom I\u2019d thought so highly of and was sooooooooooo physically attracted to would\u2019ve actually flirted with me. This guy wasn\u2019t my penance, he was my joy. This guy had somehow turned into my standard of measuring other men by in secret.\n\nMy guy tore the shower, frame and all, down around the claw-footed bathtub. I stood there mortified, half covered in soap and fully covered in my own shame, once again in front of an open window. He \u201cinquired\u201d about the text. I reached for my towel. He threw it down the staircase. He ripped into our bedroom and threw my three tiered jewelry box out of the glass of the second story window. I screamed for him to stop to no avail. I grabbed another towel and reached for him. He pushed me down the staircase. When we made it to the living room he smashed my phone into the wall and threw me onto the couch. I cried. I apologized. I tried  to tell him that nothing happened. He drug me by my hair to our front room. He smacked me. He left. He left the door wide open with me there crying, wet, sobbing, in a towel on the floor.\n\nI only talked to my banjo player once after that. I told him that I was sorry. I told him that we couldn\u2019t see each other or talk to each other anymore. I had to call him from a friend\u2019s cellphone. She picked me up from work that day. I told him that it wasn\u2019t his fault. I told him how much love I had in my heart for him. Then we didn\u2019t speak again. We ran into each other randomly, three times over the following seven years. \n\nThose next seven years of my life were just a series of punishments. I prostrated myself to my guy and let him dictate each horrible thing that I had to endure as payment for wanting a love that wasn\u2019t poisoned, a love that was kind. My guilt was overwhelming. I felt like I didn\u2019t have a right to breathe. What\u2019s worse is that I felt sympathy for him, I pandered to him, told myself that I deserved every horrific thing he asked me to do, because I\u2019d emotionally betrayed him. \n\nHe read every diary and coerced me with my words, pretending that he knew my mind. He monitored every social occasion. He went through my phone. He called me to check up on me at work. He picked out my clothes when I wasn\u2019t in uniform. He chose who I talked to. He chose who I interacted with. He berated me. He belittled me. He threw me away. He passed me out. He stole my heart, my mind, my hope. He took my youth, my na\u00efvet\u00e9, my being- he warped them. He chewed me up and he kept chewing and chewing and chewing...\n\n...I can\u2019t even tell you about the two years of my life that I gave him when he got his ankle broken in a bar fight. I mean, straight up being his nurse maid, emptying his piss and shit containers because he couldn\u2019t make it to the bathroom, paying all of our bills, working full time and waiting on him around the clock. Bathing him. Dressing him. That was ages 24-26. Most girls went on Spring Break or decided to pursue a master\u2019s degree, not me. Or about when he was dealing and got our house raided by - drug task force. My Grandmother\u2019s house. My Grandmother was home when it happened. My Grandmother bailed his ass out. Every belonging of mine strewn about across the floor. Everything. My underwear to my jewelry. My cats were put out of the house. My handicapped cats. Everything was destroyed. Nothing was left undisturbed. Or when he put my bottom tooth through my lip when he hip me in the face with a beer bottle. Or when he hit me so hard in the side of the head I couldn\u2019t hear correctly for over a year. The list goes on and on.\n\nIt took years of wallowing in his abuse, self loathing and depression before I realized that something had to change. Every morning I woke up and felt this heaviness, this lack of desire to be alive. He ate away at everything that I was until nothing was left; this adult, this should\u2019ve-known-better, abusive, drunk, hateful (now over 40 yr old) man who obviously (to everyone else) wasn\u2019t going to change for anything. Sure, there were good times, trips, amazing gifts and extravagances, but they were always tainted with something horrible. I always paid. I always paid a dark price.\n\nShortly after my 30th birthday in 2015, I met a new friend at my job. She was very sweet, we had a lot in common and hit it off right away. My birthday is in the fall. I met her a couple of weeks after my 30th and a couple of weeks after that we played a gig together, a few weeks after that, we\u2019d made plans to be carving pumpkins for Halloween. I cleared this activity with my partner a few days before. By the time we made it to my house to carve pumpkins, my drunken partner humiliated me, yelled at me and berated me in front of my new friend. She awkwardly excused herself to leave and hugged me. She whispered in my ear \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone look so sad as when you saw him tonight.\u201d Then, she instructed me to call her if I needed anything.\n\nI left that night for the last time. He sat next to me, breath thick with alcohol and yelled \u201cwhat are we doing here, M?!!!!\u201d reaching for my shirt. I ran out of the house. I\u2019d left so many times before that, I was a pro. Keys, purse, money, pocketknife, change of clothes, toiletries, cash, valuable jewelry(already placed in a quick grab bag) and cats in the carrier. I could gather my necessities in less than 10 minutes. I had a ready bag for Christ\u2019s sake. \n\nHe left for 3 weeks to stay with his brother in Oregon before a final week of supposedly leaving for good. He made me agree to let him stay with me for the final week he returned. (He never had any damned money and every excuse in the world) I know it sounds stupid but I cannot even explain how manipulative this man was or how fucked up from my guilt I was. This was the biggest mistake. Remember when I said that I could remember the last time  he physically assaulted me clearly? Yeah...\n\n... we spent a pretty tearful week trying to say goodbye in some weird, our-version-of-healthy way until the last night before his departure. We drank wine, listened to music and he tried with all his mental-might to convince me that we belonged together. That it could be like it had been...\n\n...then we got into an argument because I disagreed. He went into a rage. He destroyed my house. I remember that he destroyed the kitchen first, throwing everything that he could get his hands on. Then the next room, then the next, my keepsakes, my furniture, my jewelry, my clothes, my artwork, until he got to the music room. He picked up my piano bench and flung it against the wall, my antique sheet music collection floated like confetti in the air. I\u2019m screaming at him to get out, get out, get out!!!! Then his anger turned to me.\n\nIf there ever was love there, if a narcissist can even love, there was no love left. Whatever was there had been replaced by hate, resentment, and rage.  He smacked me around a few times before he threw me to the ground. Now, I\u2019m not a small girl by any means, nor am I weak, but he over powered me. At one point to avoid being put down, when his arms were wrapped around my face and chest, I bit him as hard as I could in the meat of his bicep. He didn\u2019t budge. He flipped me and wrapped his hands around my throat, throwing me to the ground. I remember my vision going blurry, clawing at him as his grip got tighter. I could taste blood. I didn\u2019t know where it was coming from. \n\nMy 77 year old Grandmother unlocked the front door screaming that the cops were on the way. He let go of my throat and kept screaming that I\u2019d ruined his life. He tried to throw a television at my Grandmother, screaming that he was going to put both of them out of a window. By that point, I\u2019d gotten myself off of the ground and had picked up the face of a dresser drawer that he\u2019d destroyed. \n\nI hit him. I hit him hard. He fell back into the floor and blood pooled under his head. He wouldn\u2019t wake up. We shook him and shook him. It wasn\u2019t until the sirens were audible that he came to. \n\nHe was taken away and I was placed under a protective order thereafter. I begged the cops to let him go back to NY, but he was being prosecuted whether I liked it or not.  Nine long months later, he finally moved back to NY and to my knowledge hasn\u2019t returned. It\u2019s been almost four years since. He\u2019s called me at weird times on weird nights, ten times in a row but I never answer. I\u2019ve returned texts stating that any contact will be construed as harassment. He still calls my friends every now and then...\n\nI have moved on. I feel like I left for the right reasons. I wanted to feel something good again. I wanted to believe that anything was possible again. I wanted to believe that I could have love again. I wanted to believe that I had worth again. I hated feeling like there was no hope or joy left in my life. He made me doubt my strength. I have since found a lot of strength, within myself and through others. Seven months after I left him, I started seeing my banjo player. He was instrumental in helping to break the empathic/narcissist cycle. We\u2019ve been together ever since and have a beautiful, two year old daughter and lead a pleasant, loving, enriching life together. \n\nThe weird thing is that my narcissist disgusts me, but so many integral parts of myself still remind me of him. We were together at that age where you develop major parts of your adult identity. Some of my mannerisms/expressions remind me of him. Dates will remind me of him. Foods will remind me of him. I can\u2019t tell a story without knowing, whether or not I mention it, he\u2019s a part of them. Only in the last few years did I really start to develop identity without him. \n\nI still struggle with the \u201cHow did I let someone do this to me?\u201d , \n\u201cHow did I hate myself so much to let this happen?\u201d, \u201cHow could I have sacrificed myself to such a terrible person?\u201d and the \u201cHow could I have been so blind?\u201d along with a million other questions. I don\u2019t feel entirely whole in spite of the progress that I\u2019ve made and frankly, I still have nightmares that my old Narc is going to show up and murder me. His effect on my life is remembered frequently and it just doesn\u2019t feel fair that I still live under his influences. \n\nAny advice would be greatly welcome. I\u2019m sorry if this is a little disjointed. Ten years is a long time and like I said, my memory of a lot of things in the timeline are kind of jumbled. I blocked a lot of things out. \n\nThank you again if anyone read until the end. Bless you all. \n\nAny advice is welcome. I\u2019ll offer any more details if there are questions.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

But what I'm finding lately is that so many people will just take your energy and everything you give them, keep taking and never give anything back, as is the case with narcissists. This has been really difficult for me to wrap my head around. \n\nFirst of all, it's inconceivable to me that someone would come into my life just to harm me, to not engage with me truthfully, and to steal my energy for their own gain. So, when I'm interacting with someone who is clearly doing this to me, it's like it just doesn't compute. I get major cognitive dissonance, and I start going into over-drive to \"make the relationship work\", whether it be romantic, work, friendship, etc. It's like I have these rose-colored glasses on that I stubbornly refuse to take off. \n\nI want to trust people and I want to have positive relationships with them. But this goodwill and openness is exactly what has caused me to be preyed upon and taken advantage of. Narcissists and other predators only see these traits as an easy way in, they don't see them as a gift. And time after time again, I've attracted predatory people into my life who just want to psychologically/emotionally dominate me and manipulate me into a state of powerlessness. \n\nIt's like I don't understand that some people simply are **creeps**.

I've just discovered this sub and it makes me quite happy. My story is the following:\n\nAs a writer, I've been surrounded my entire life by narcissists. It was ME who has always been looking for them because of their creativity. But that had a huge downside, and I had to bear and endure being constantly ill-treated. Five months ago I cut all my relationships, all of them, and began to build my ego for the first time in my life. It feels strange and really lonely, but I'm so much better.\n\nI don't think that artists are narcissistic by nature. Some are not. I'm not. I'm more a giver than a taker. As soon as I read the content of this sub, I asked myself **why I have always been around them**, looking for them, even knowing the consequences. And as I have not masochistic tendencies, I gather that it was the creativity what attracted me. \n\nIn these last five months I've been able to create a world of my own. I've finished several writings and made pieces that I had always left aside because I was attending my narcissistic partners. I was with them during their creative process, supporting and encouraging them and letting them to suck off my energy. I was with them when they were feeling insecure and swallowed by their own paranoias, feeding their world. Gratitude was not waiting for me at the end of the work or in any phase of the project. Not that I was waiting for it, I was much more absorbed by the work created. But after years of not being thanked, I began to resent it at the end of last year. I cannot believe I've endured so much psychological abuse. \n\nThe funny bit is that there's currently an exhibition on Picasso in my city, and I feel sick whenever I see the posters. No one can convince me that his art deserved the exploitation of his women. It's not worth it.\n\nFortunately the last one had several victims to suck off and I've been left alone.

A girl gathered a few of her friends, explained that something they had done had her feelings, even tho it wasnt something that caused her direct harm.

Not as dramatically or as direct as in the show of course but Im sure you all know what I mean. Maybe the reason I cant take that scene seriously is because that has never happened to me.

And she couldnt just take my feelings into consideration without throwing out something that was equally as bad that i had done to her. that is if she couldnt deny or worm her way out of it in the first place at least.\n\nWatching that part of the show put me off so much because it started me thinking. Yeah, Im sure there were plenty of people that grew up with relationships that taught them and allowed for theirs feelings to be valid. So much so that they were able to say \"my feelings were hurt and this is why\".

As soon as we were close enough, I introduced him in the laws of NC. \n\nUnfortunately once she was cut off, her smear campaign began and she spent months calling him gay even though his relationship with me became public knowledge (and only because she\u2019d lied about him on a radio station). \n\nA few nights ago, someone was interacting with us on instagram and I said that I would characterise their involvement as abuse. She screenshotted my comment and posted it to her 90k followers calling me a bully. \n\nI received a few messages from people confronting me about bullying and to each one I responded with the same thing: I don\u2019t care what she says about me and I stand by my comments 100%: *being violent, harassing someone and starting rumours about their sexuality IS abuse*. Luckily I had plenty of screenshots to back this up. \n\nIf calling her behaviour abusive makes me a bully, then I am cool with that because it is abusive. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t had the chance to call my nEx an abuser yet, but I\u2019m glad I got this opportunity. \n\nWe made a lot of media outlets about how she\u2019s an abuser so it\u2019s in the public domain now. \n\nI couldn\u2019t have done without support through that therapy and the people on this reddit.

I was only with her for a short time, she moved away and we both knew she was going to so she basically crammed everything I\u2019ve been reading about into a matter of months. I was willing to try for more but she always was a bit vague about if she wanted to. But it makes it even more painful to think that maybe she didn\u2019t even find me attractive at all. She said she \u2018thought I was going to be a gym lad man whore\u2019 and she was surprised how quiet and caring I was. Physically I do look like that but I\u2019m a pretty emotional guy really.

At a loss...", "author": "Lichbedford", "self_text": "We have been dating for a year and half, living together for six months and I am utterly lost, exhausted and drained in what to do next. \n\nI fell in love with him and the relationship was amazing. We did things together, spent time together, went on dates, had fun, I was happy and excited. \n\nIssues came up a few months in and it was a huge deal for me, I loved him and was willing to be okay to accept them while trying to come up with creative ideas. The issue was he no longer wanted to go outside with me on dates. Something would come up like a pulled muscle, didn't sleep well, or wouldn't get out of bed, or asked to push the day to the next day. At first I was totally fine with it. Then it began to happen more and more.\n\nI am in counseling and I was working on expressing my own feelings. I expressed my feelings of sadness or disappointment about not being able to go to an event to a date, he wouldn't take it well. He would began to blame me for telling him how he SHOULD be feeling when I was EXPRESSING MY FEELINGS. I was confused and hurt because I had no idea what the hell was going on.\n\nSummer arrives after all that (last year) and I am coming up with different things just to go out with him and experience things with him, learn new things about one another, etc., he wasn't having it. I tried to do thing just on his interests and I didn't care if I would enjoy going at that point, I wanted to do something outside of the house/apartment. Nope. It was a hassle.\n\nWe began to have arguments around this. I eventually just accepted it, that he isn't someone who likes going out like how he talked about doing. I settled inside watching Netflix and he wouldn't watch anything with me. \n\nSex seemed to be the only thing that seemed to actually be a highlight I looked forward to and had fun with. Then, issues came up with that. \n\nIn the winter a family member passed away suddenly and I moved in. I gave up my apartment to be with him because I loved him and his family. Things just got much worse.\n\nHe asked me what was wrong one morning. I told him and he flipped at me telling me I was being selfish and that I should be thinking about him and how he feels. I was honest with him and told him how I felt because of something he did that upset me (slammed the door in my face while I was talking to him). I cried when he left and called me selfish.\n\nI am not allowed to talk about my feelings and when I do he feels I am telling him how to feel. I am using the \"I\" statements when I talk about myself. Whenever, I bring up anything that lead us to where we are now, he says, \"you can't do that, you can't blame me for that.\" When I am trying to communicate things like, \"I have tried to communicate and try different things...\" or \"I have come up with creative ideas on dates and left it up to you or just found things around your likes and interests, so we can go out on a date together.\" Then, he is telling me I am blaming him and bringing up his faults. \n\n(I am sure I have brought up his faults, I make mistakes) \n\nI am dealing with anger. He is constantly angry. I can't talk to him without it turning into an argument. I don't even know how the fuck it turns into one. He calls me names. More recently the name calling, bitch, fat. He tells me I am not empathic towards him at all. \n\nI have been incredibly patient with him. I am understanding of him. I try my best to walk in his shoes. Our planned dates are pushed back or sometimes never happens. I am there supporting him through everything when we are suppose to be on a date having fun. We are dating, I love him, I will stand by him and help him, every time we have something planned excuses come up. I am there not judging him and trying my hardest to not tell him to \"suck it up and get up\" instead I am there asking what he needs. Half the times he doesn't talk or tell me.\n\nWhen we go on the date, it's complaining. I ignore it and try to not let it effect me. It does.\n\nWe don't have sex anymore. We aren't intimate anymore. I bought lingerie and I was wondering if I should tell him or not. I showed him and his response was, \"oh.\" Then pulls something from the bag and, \"wha, this feels and looks like a table cloth.\" Seriously? Later, I asked him a question and I hesitated to ask and he was like, \"sweetie, I am not in the mood for sex, get your toy out\" I sat there speechless. It began an argument and it wasn't what I was going to ask. \n\nHe tells me I am gaslighting him. I am emotionally abusive. Then, tells me I am showing traits of narcissism. I immediately went small and my head went down and I cried. I reacted that way because I fled from a serious narcissist to a womens shelter. Do you know what I said? I told him I was sorry and that it was my worst nightmare to turn into my family member that I fled from and if that is what's going on with me, then I seriously need to find a way to see a psychiatrist for help. I continue saying, it's not fair to him or anyone else because I know what its like to live with one and I don't want to become one.\n\nHe told me it will be okay.\n\nI felt crazy. I recorded an argument. I let a friend listen to it because I wanted a third party to listen to it and tell me if I truly need help. I was told that he kept saying, \"you\" statements and when I was talking I was using \"I\" statements. Then, they noticed when I talked about my feelings he turned it into I was telling him how he should feel. Then, in the recording he was set we had sex on a day and I said we didn't. We argued over it. Him trying to convince me otherwise and I kept saying that wasn't what happened. My friend said that he made such a big deal out of it. \n\nLately, he is worried I will cheat on him. What was revealed in the recording, I feel he cheated on me that day and tried to convince me otherwise. He got really angry. \n\nHere are my questions finally: \nCan someone successfully be in a relationship with a narcissist (or someone I am describing if they, both of us, work on issues) would it ever change? \n\nWe have tried couples counseling and he bitched i talked about myself. I talked about issues within the relationship. He didn't want to go, didn't like the counselor and wasn't interested in transferring. \n\nHe also doesn't like sarcasm very well.\n\nWould counseling help or its just going to be a loss? \n\nHe is now telling me he wants to die and maybe he is trying to make me feel bad for him. I am just exhausted with trying and I have no idea what to do. I don't know how to tell if he is serious or not.\n\nI don't know what to do. I love him.

My nex and I had decided she\u2019d move back to England to \u2018grow up\u2019 and learn how to be independent without me enabling her. After 2 years we were supposed to re-evaluate. This is after she stopped paying rent for 6 months and 10 months of catching her in lie after lie. (We lived together for 2.5 years)\n\nWell, within 10 days of moving after our tearful goodbye at the airport, she texted me saying \u2018I don\u2019t want to freak you out, but I think I was raped last night\u2019. She went on in detail about how she was drinking and everything went black and she came to at her house feeling like something happened. She texted me a photo of an empty bag of powder she supposedly found in her room.\n\nI immediately told her to contact the police, make a report and get a test done. She expressed a little resistance but then ended up saying she was about to go. She told me her story later of how she was told she had a date rape drug in her system, latex and tears down there, and she had a PTSD episode when they told her she\u2019d been raped. She said they gave her an IV to calm her down.\n\nI\u2019d noticed some holes in her story but wanted to respect her &amp; not immediately doubt her. She was not given any paperwork from the hospital or police which was a huge red flag. After a couple of days, I asked more about the report and paperwork. \n\nTo make a long story short, I ended up asking her for a picture of her arm where they gave her the IV. She has anemia which causes a lot of bruising and IV marks are extremely visible on her arm for up to a week. She guilt tripped me for a bit and then sent a picture. It was obvious there was no puncture wound and that she tried pinching her arm to make it look like something was there.\n\nSince we lived together for so long, I remembered her passwords to social media accounts. Considering she couldn\u2019t tell me who she was with when she went out, I logged in looking for more information. And I didn\u2019t find anything at all, except for a random message on instagram from some guy flirting with her out of nowhere. Then I thought to check Tinder, so I logged in. \n\nTurns out, she was not raped at all. Within a week of moving there she had downloaded Tinder and started messaging guys to meet up with them. The night she told me she was raped, she actually met up with and had consensual unprotected sex a random guy. She asked him for valium earlier in the week. She had asked him the next day \u2018if she should be worried since we didn\u2019t use a condom\u2019. \n\nI took screenshots and sent it to her. I also messaged the guy letting him know what she had claimed since I would want to know. She at first tried claiming that guy got her drugged up and took advantage of her. But as we were messaging she was also messaging this guy to come over that very night. Then she tried claiming she was raped by a different guy. When I asked her when she said she doesn\u2019t remember. Obviously caught in a lie.\n\nHere\u2019s the part that tripped me out. Before I had recognized the my nex was a covert narcissist, I actually believed she loved me and cared about me. I was ignorant to the extent of abuse and cheating at the time. So when I messaged her screenshots of her asking the guy she claimed drugged her to come over that night, her response was the middle finger emoji.\n\n3 years of putting all of my love, support, and energy into this relationship. Only to find out this person didn\u2019t give two shits about me. It hurt. So I had asked her \u2018Why are you being so mean?\u2019 and \u2018I don\u2019t even know who you are anymore, the girl I fell in love with would never do this\u2019.\n\nHer response was what tripped me out now knowing she\u2019s a covert narcissist. Her response was, \u2018I don\u2019t know who I am anymore either\u2019.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\u201d\n\nYou need to take a hard look at your relationship with the Narc. Examine their action's, and also your own. Everything can and will be used against you. Everything can be twisted and used against you. They will always have an audience dumb enough to stand for them. Get to know who they really are, and once the pieces are all on the board, nothing will surprise you or shock you. \n\nIt sounds confusing at first, you want to lash out and defend yourself. \"How can these people believe what they are saying????\" You're the fresh piece of meat, in a world that consumes suffering. People pass judgement quickly to wash away the feelings of their own sin. You will quickly discover who your real friends are, and when you do...you realize something: I don't have to sit in the dark and wonder who has my back. People and their allegiances will make themselves known within the first few days/weeks. \n\n\\-----\n\nThis is how it all goes down:\n\n1. You get away from them, and at first you are riding an emotional high. You got away from someone who in your mind was as close to pure evil.\n2. The feeling begins to wear off, you're no longer the center of their world. You begin to feel withdrawal of their attention, crazy sex, \"nice things\" they did.\n3. Then the first hit comes, you either get nailed to the cross on social media either by them, or a flying monkey, or your \"friends\" begin to stop responding to you one by one. You go to the club and people your Narc knows begin to approach you, or begin to whisper whilst you're around. It suddenly seems like all eyes are on you. You start to defend yourself, but you're stuck in a pit of quicksand.\n4. You suddenly start to feel isolated, alone, your mind plays tricks on you. You feel like everyone has turned against you, it's unfair, people you trusted bought a lie. \n5. You stew on it, stare at the messenger screen of facebook. Considering sharing your side to people, confronting those who you know wronged you. DO-NOT-DO-THIS. Your Narc by now has a very well established network of informants who will dime on you without a second thought. \n6. Your real friends will begin to make themselves known. You will turn to them, and they will offer a port in the storm. It's at this point you begin to put the pieces together and realize what you were dealing with, and thus you stumble upon the term \"Narcissist.\" \n7. Suddenly it all makes sense, their behavior, how they operate, the smear campaign. You understand, and truly understand what gaslighting is. The fog begins to lift, and things you repressed start to come to the surface. You learn things about them, and about yourself.\n8. You have people who love you, yet you feel so violated and alone. You begin to beat yourself up and accuse yourself of things your Narc said you did. Either it be violence, poor behavior, whatever...you slip into a depression, drink alot, chain smoke, whatever to numb the pain.\n9. Your people begin to tell you what your Narc is doing on social media and in public. These posts aren't specifically naming you, but you already know they are about you. Typical examples \"It's okay to love yourself,\" \"It's okay to cut toxic people out of your life.\" \"I was so hurt and abused, and he isolated me and gas lighted me.\" Your Narc will NEVER-EVER-EVER ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN ACTION'S. \n10. It's at this point...you take to the internet and find us. You learn that you are not alone, and this is how the war is fought.\n11. You begin NC (No contact) and you have to commit to this. You have to block them on EVERYTHING, and you have to remove their confirmed allies. Lock down your social media, make a small group of people you know who you can trust able to see your stuff. Information is important in this war, and the less they know, the less they can use. They have a finite amount of information about you, and after you go NC you shut off the tap. Narc's will then resort to being a broken record, and repeating what they've said. Posting their \"self help\" nonsense. Overtime, holes in the story appear, people stop listening, their allies begin to have their own problems. Your name stops coming up, and the drama begins to disappear. \n12. It's at this point your old personality begins to reemerge and you start going places your narc wont be. You begin to see the world differently, you realize you held the keys to the jail the whole time. You understand that what happened, happened. You begin to post about your life on social media, you're not snarky, you don't post what can be interpreted as an attack. People begin to see that you weren't the bad person, you moved onto other newer things. Meanwhile the Narc is back in the past, still running their mouth. Don't be shocked if they find someone new to play with. When the attention if cut off, they seek it from another person. It sucks, you wanna warn them, but it's not your job to save people.\n13. You return to the fields you left, people see you differently. You smile and laugh with people, and you never mention your Narc, at all. You see them, they see you, and they realize that you broke their hold over them. You are free to do what you want, without them. They may start something else up, but you've built a support network and understand their tricks. You wont fall prey to them, you wont let them back in.

Apparently other people\u2019s parents don\u2019t hear a rumor that their religious views don\u2019t match only to show up where they are and force them in the car so they can be brought home and cornered in the room to be verbally attacked. \n\nDid you know that other parents don\u2019t drug test their kids randomly starting at 13? Because I didn\u2019t. I was told I couldn\u2019t be trusted and if I failed a test I would be sent to live with grandparents in another state. \n\nI didn\u2019t know other kids didn\u2019t have to start taking care of themselves when they got sick at the age of 9 because their mother had mental illness and couldn\u2019t handle it. \n\nMy mom had good intentions when she refused to take me to the doctor to get a note for pink eye in 7th grade. I almost failed due to absence, but it\u2019s better that happens than I dare ever get antibiotics. \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t all bad, right? They had good intentions so it couldn\u2019t be abusive. They just wanted me to be safe, I think? \n\nOr what about the time that my dad drove overnight just so he could make it to my chorus concert when I had a solo? He loved me didn\u2019t he? \n\nAnd abusive parents wouldn\u2019t do things like buy a car for me, would they? Or help me with my bills from time to time? \n\nThe hardest part of abuse for me, has been accepting that it happened. Even now, in this anonymous forum, at the age of 23 living an hour away from my parents and having been out of the house for nearly 7 years... I\u2019m fearful of posting this. Because maybe I\u2019m still wrong? Maybe it wasn\u2019t abuse? What if they see this and they\u2019re upset by it? Because how dare I write my experiences if it puts them in a negative light.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I (23 M) was crazy in love with her (21 F) as she was with me. We were long distance, I moved to her for a while, then I had to go home as I graduated college. She chose a job on the other side of the country. She moved there this week. I was supposed to be there today. I cancelled the flight and I feel so bad but I know it was right. She texted me saying she didn\u2019t want to live knowing she didn\u2019t have me. She told me she wanted to die. She called me sobbing promising to change. Hearing her cry like that broke my head. I told her I didn\u2019t believe her. I feel like she was telling the truth because she had never talked to me like that and I\u2019ll never know if she actually changed. \n\nShe grew up with a narcissistic father who I absolutely hate. He was mentally abusive to her and he treats her and his family like shit. He\u2019s really successful and he thinks all that matters is money. He raised her to think like that. She has turned into her father. She doesn\u2019t care about being happy, a family, etc. she just wants to be successful in work. She has become very judgmental over everything I do and unsupportive when I want to change something in my life. She grew up around him treating his wife (ex\u2019s stepmother) like shit. My ex thought I\u2019d always be there for her because her step mother stayed. He cheated on her, would scream at her, would make all of these threats, etc. She hadn\u2019t cheated but she would scream, threaten to cheat, call me names, control me, manipulate me, and she hit me a few times. I know this sounds really, really stupid but I know she has a really big heart behind all of that and that she\u2019s an amazing person. She has done so much for me and she honestly made me the happiest I have ever been. I know she\u2019s like this because of her father\u2019s emotional abuse over the years and that makes me so upset. She was crying saying she realized she is turning into her dad. She was alone in a new city by herself crying in her apartment for hours. I feel so terrible. I know I can\u2019t change her but I just wish she grew up without such a piece of shit dad.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

You decide not to test that threat, which I\u2019ve been grateful for.\n\nRaping me while drunk, pretending to yourself that I want it. I never once asked you to surprise rape me. Just because it was one of your ex\u2019s kinks, (one of your many ex\u2019s whom you talk about CONSTANTLY, and mix up my likes n dislikes with theirs CONSTANTLY) does not give you permission to do it to me. \n\nGetting so mad that I told someone you raped me that me begging forgiveness three times was not enough. Of course it wasn\u2019t enough, you knew YOU were the wrong one. \n\nTelling me a \u201cjoke/fantasy\u201d about wanting to smash me through a wall so my ass is trapped, having your buddies throw dildoes at me like a dart board trying to land one inside me (that\u2019s not how it works??) and then saying \u201cI was just saying dumb shit, don\u2019t get grouchy about it\u201d \n\nI tell you I don\u2019t think I should have to text and call you multiple times or every hour while I\u2019m out doing things away from you. You trap me in the bedroom for hours, interrogating and insulting me. You hide my keys. This happens on a weekly basis about ANYTHING I try to say no about. \n\nYou finally escalate to slapping me when I try to escape one of your never-ending interrogations. You order me to go to bed with you after that. I am scared, but the next time I\u2019m drunk the fear goes away and we both know what happened next. (I punched him, a lot, and went to jail for it. I know it\u2019s wrong but I\u2019m still glad I did it. I can\u2019t find it in me to feel bad. I finally didn\u2019t have to live with him anymore!)\n\nYou are always telling me to stop holding my phone a certain way because you can\u2019t see my screen when I do that. It\u2019s just the most efficient way to hold my phone n how I\u2019ve always done it. I explain this. I try to adjust for your insecurity, but forget occasionally. You get mad every time I forget, sometimes insulting me to \u201cmake the lesson stick\u201d I suppose. \n\nChristmas Day. I\u2019ve spent the night sitting up by my deathly sick baby, too worried about him to be shocked by the way you angrily yelled at me when I said I was concerned about him before you went to bed. The next morning, he is near death. I know if I wake you, you will stop me from calling an ambulance. I get the call made barely before you come charging out of the bedroom asking what\u2019s goin on. \n\nWhen I tell you, sure enough you start angrily asking me if that\u2019s really necessary and saying he can\u2019t be that bad. You blather on like this until the ambulance shows up, then you suddenly change into a very caring, attentive person, acting sooo concerned and getting a bag together for the hospital. \n\nYou tell me sorry after this. I hate you so much but I\u2019m concentrating on my dying son (he\u2019s two, with what turns out to be three respiratory viruses, RSV, the flu and the common cold, two of which are absolutely deadly on their own to a baby, much less combined) and I let it go.\n\nWe are at your family\u2019s house for Christmas. It\u2019s one of the first times I\u2019ve got together with all your family. I\u2019m nervous but trying to get comfortable and relax and enjoy myself. You constantly come up and whisper in my ear that I\u2019m not doing things right. At one point you can\u2019t find me because I\u2019m putting my toddler down for a nap. You get so enraged that you walk around the family gathering with a dark, dramatic attitude, making everyone uncomfortable. I go outside to cry at this point. You tell me I\u2019m an idiot, useless, worthless for crying and I\u2019ve ruined the day and made a fool out of you and myself in front of your family.\n\nI go to one of your dirt bike events for the first time. Thursday at PIR. I\u2019ve never been, I don\u2019t know how anything works, I\u2019m nervous, it\u2019s a huge crowd of people but I wanna be there because it\u2019s something you enjoy and you really want me to come (and wear something sexy of course, gotta show off your pretty trophy to the guys). You get irritated any time I don\u2019t know what to do or where to go, and start leaving me behind, walking ahead of me, leaving me even more unsure and unhappy and scared. I never want to go anywhere with you again.\n\nInsisting that I pull up my shirt to show off my tits to your buddy. I say no so you grab my shirt and pull it up. I don\u2019t want to cause an angry embarrassing scene so I just go with it. This becomes the norm, until I\u2019m used to it. \n\nGetting me drunk, using my phone to pretend to be me, asking your buddy to come fuck me, then pushing me out the door when he arrives. Both times this happens, I drink so much just to get through it that I only remember vague bits about the actual act. I try to enjoy it and be ok with this stuff, because you want it so bad and it\u2019s one of the only things I can do that make you act like you genuinely love me. \n\nHe knows it was you on my phone pretending to be me, just so you know. He knows I absolutely wasn\u2019t really into it at all and was only doing it for you.\n\nYou like to make sexual comments about my small children. While they are playing, any time they do anything that might be construed as sexual if adults were doing it \u201clook, he\u2019s TRYING to put his head between her legs.\u201d If they are snuggling \u201cew stop doing that, you guys don\u2019t need to be hugging\u201d when you noticed my 6 year old daughter has dark hair on her legs \u201cugh that\u2019s gross. the girls in MY house shave their legs\u201d She\u2019s SIX. You don\u2019t tell a fucking 6 year old her legs are gross and she needs to shave.\n\nMay I suggest a psych evaluation to see if you are a sexual threat to children?\n\nYou OFTEN threw it in my face that \u201cif I\u2019m so bad why don\u2019t you just leave, if you feel like I\u2019m a threat to you or your kids then you are just a bad mom for not leaving\u201d. Haha like I could, I was financially dependent on you and you knew it. Guess what, I\u2019m not anymore.\n\nLiterally any time I tell you \u201cNo\u201d you hear \u201cargue, insult, and threaten her until she says yes\u201d You are the epitome of the disgusting, creepy guy who refuses to take no for an answer. Fifty no\u2019s makes a yes, amirite haha. \n\nYou made it a habit to find something to call me worthless about, on the regular. I was in recovery, trying to rebuild my life and myself, and you did literally everything you could think of to make sure I was entirely dependent on you, that I knew I was so worthless nobody else would want me, and I could not survive or make it without you. You also made sure to let me know I wasn\u2019t even good at the \u201cfew things\u201d you asked of me in return for being my \u201crescuing knight in shining armor\u201d. \n\nYou made it very clear that all of these behaviors of yours that made me feel so bad about myself and like I was better off dead and not being a burden anymore were MY fault, and that I needed to communicate better, that was all. \n\nWhile dating, I stayed the night at your house. You would get mad at me that I didn\u2019t fetch towels out of your cupboard so you could have sex with me and keep your sheets clean. You didn\u2019t ask me to, you didn\u2019t go get them yourself, you just went straight to anger that I didn\u2019t know to automatically fetch towels for sex. I wanted to leave and never come back. I learned my lesson tho. I fetched those towels after that didn\u2019t I?\n\nYou guilted me back to you with \u201cbut everyone knows we are getting married, I don\u2019t wanna look like a fool, you are my last chance, let\u2019s talk about this. If you just communicated with me, these things wouldn\u2019t happen!\u201d\n\nUh, no amount of communication can stop an asshole from being an asshole, as I\u2019ve come to find out. It\u2019s always either agree with you or be argued with, guilt tripped, insulted and threatened until I say I agree with you AND I say I\u2019m sorry for making you mad.\n\nI have to stop listing things, it\u2019s too upsetting. Just know this. I tried to pretend for two years that you were NOT a garbage human being, and you tried your best to convince me I WAS.\n\nI no longer care if you ever see how much you hurt me. \n\nI don\u2019t care if you ever admit or see what you did was all kinds of abusive. \n\nI don\u2019t care about your promises that things will be different or I owe you ANOTHER chance. \n\nI don\u2019t care about your sorries, you are too late with them, as always. \n\nI don\u2019t care that when I say I don\u2019t like the disrespectful way you talk to me, or the horrible crazy things you do and say to me, you try to tell me it\u2019s all in my head and you don\u2019t really act like that. \n\nI don\u2019t care that you can\u2019t understand that the things you do and say are NOT \u201cjust regular stuff people say when they are mad, so get over it, you know I didn\u2019t mean it\u201d but ONLY something an abusive person says, ever. \n\nI don\u2019t care that right now you are probably coming up with things you can say to me to \u201cshow her she\u2019s just as bad\u201d or \u201ctell her she actually wanted it even tho she said no at first.\u201d\n\nI will no longer let you guilt trip me into accepting your disgusting, damaging, controlling behavior. Don\u2019t even try. I am saying NO, and this time, I don\u2019t care to hear your arguments about why I\u2019m wrong to say no to you. \n\nAre you allowed to call me? NO. \nAre you allowed to send letters to me? NO.\nAre you allowed to come visit me? NO.\n\nI don\u2019t care about whatever it is you plan to do as a result of me saying no. I will protect myself and my kids however I have to. Restraining order will be placed if I EVER even get the smallest feeling you will be a threat to me or my kids. That includes if you try to spread rumors about me that will hurt me.\n\nMy therapist has helped me put a domestic violence safety plan in place. This means that if you do not respect my \u201cNo\u201d, or you do ANYTHING to try to threaten, scare, or guilt me (by way of harming yourself or others and saying it\u2019s my fault) you will not succeed, and there WILL be consequences. You will not get away with it anymore. \n\nI find it sad that you are the type of person who needs to be threatened to have their dick bit off before they stop forcing themselves on someone else. It\u2019s regrettable. It\u2019d be nice if simple communication could fix our issues but that was never an option with someone like you. I genuinely hope you get better and can change that part about you, for the sake of anybody else who falls for your fake \u201cnice guy\u201d routine.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have been pretty reserved the last month because of this and the state it left me in.\n\nI haven\u2019t been on any social media (minus reddit but I have no real life friends on here that know me) for a month.

My mom used to hit me too but I never saw it as abuse. She only ever did it when I actually did shitty things and she always apologised and hugged me afterwards. But it triggered me and scared me because of my dad's abuse (which she knew but never did anything about and I don't blame her for that because he used to beat her too). I asked her to discipline me some other way but she continued doing it anyway. She'd also complain to relatives and my friends' parents about me. I've had depression since I was 14 and during the first few weeks I had no idea how to deal with it which meant I was moody and easily irritable. She told everyone that I was a nightmare to deal with and for the longest time my friends' parents saw me as a bad influence on their children.\n\nThis brings me to my current problem. I had anorexia when I was 14. My mom was a busy woman and I never blamed her for not noticing that  I wasn't eating until people starting pointing out how much weight I had lost. The first time someone did (they jokingly asked if I wasn't being fed at home) she completely lost it and screamed at me for ruining her reputation, which is also how she made me eat. 4 years later I've put on enough weight that I now have a healthy BMI of 20. But she has started calling me fat and saying things like 'you know you look really fat next to jess' or 'wow you look fat in this picture'.

I'd really appreciate some insight and support.  Please be honest, I want to know the hard truths now so I can get over it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's start off with saying I have been diagnosed with bipolar II. It's been quite a few years since I've been treating it but in high school I was still undiagnosed and suffering. I had a rough childhood (neglect, not abuse) and only one parent, and a lot of shitty friends that would flake on me and/or had their own problems, and I lost all of my friends at one point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know if it's because mania increases your libido or if it was something particular to me but I was interested in sex at a very young age.  Lots of self-exploring by 8, cybering in yahoo chatrooms... My first sexual experience was having phone sex with a girlfriend of mine (I want to say I was 9? 10?) who lived in a different state. My online friends would regularly call me 'jailbait' as a nickname when I was 14-16. During this time, I met the man I would have my first long-term relationship online.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met him playing a game when I was 13 or 14. He was 10 years older than I was, so 23-24. We would roleplay together that our characters met and then fell in love, and one day he told me he loved me. (I even remember how it happened. I said it's pathetic that in order to fall asleep I have to imagine that someone loves me and he said \\[name\\], I love you.')  We would spend a lot of time playing together, innocently rping and then it progressed into cybering. Important note: my character had a backstory of being raped and I did do some roleplaying of dealing with that. Why? I don't know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt continued to escalate. I sent him pictures. First selfies, then less clothing, then straight up nudes. Then we'd get on webcam and I'd rub one out for him, but I never saw his face or him doing it, just his white shirt in the fucking like msn chatroom. Sometimes I'd 'forget' to mute my microphone so he could listen to me. I would never see him, he would only see me.  He told me his real name and sent me a selfie once.  I think I still have his number in my phone but I set a group of contacts to 'hidden' so I'd know who they were when they called me. He would grow distant, I would start using it to get affection from him because I loved the 'pillowtalk' afterwards.  It was worth it to have him be kind to me and feel like someone loved me in this fucking world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also start to question my memory. Most of my younger childhood is really blurry and faded I remember and feel a lot of things like gaslighting and feeling blamed for everything that went wrong and that everything was my fault. I got whiny and demanding. Finally I broke it off sometime when I was 18 and I literally don't even remember why I did it, I just remember knowing it needed to stop. The next few years were really dark for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThing is, I struggle calling it abuse. Is it really sexual abuse if it was online and I was complicit?  I could have stopped at any point, he never threatened me, and it's not like i was \\*raped\\*. I stayed a 'virgin' until many years later. I wanted the attention because he was the only person that made me feel cared about in a really fucking rough spot. He was the person who actually suggested I might have bipolar and to go see a therapist. He bought me my first games on Steam and got me playing   He was also 10 fucking years older than me and I was a fucking child.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis all affected me the rest of my life. I had a string of more online flings (one guy which I flew out and visited with for a few weeks who would gaslight me and said he 'didn't think i was a virgin because i was so wet'). We would dirty talk about all the sex we would have and he was a kinky motherfucker and would talk about spanking me and I'd be complicit.  The first time we had sex, I disassociated but didn't realize what had happened until later.  I felt weird and he asked if I'd like him to slap me, and he did it, and i got off but afterwards said I didn't really like that which caused him to have a meltdown and accuse me of calling him a rapist because i 'revoked consent'.  That guy had his own issues and it set some really bad habits in me, but I didn't really realize the extent of my trauma until I met my current boyfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first time I even tried to have sex with CB, I disassociated \\*hard\\*.  For the next year or so I'd cycle through either disassociating at a certain point or flipping a switch into a subservient mode where I would do literally anything he asked me to and I would be really pushy about initiating sex even though I was dying inside and did not want it AT ALL but felt like I had to and pretend like I liked it.  I'd flinch and try to shove him off if he grabbed me in a certain way or I'd go stock still and lock up.  Sometimes I would bawl for hours to the point that I stopped knowing who i was and would get very confused and not know what happened and he'd have to coach me through the conversation and what got me to that point. I couldn't ever talk about anything and I tried to warn him how fucked up I was when he asked me out, to the point I said no for a year.  I still struggle with the feeling of being his 'property' and i have no fucking idea why.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy current boyfriend is a lovely human.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I just being a drama queen and faking it?  Am I distorting my memories?  Did it really happen? Does it matter if it didn't happen if I still reacted this way? Should I be over it by now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI regularly google his name and look up his old accounts to see if he's active.  When I see that he is, I panic and also want to reach out to him to talk to him.  Why?  To get some clarity on the situation?  How the fuck is that supposed to help?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni'm sorry for the length and the rambling.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It got to the point where I told several friends and someone I was seeing I don't want to be around this girl anymore I don't want to deal with this, which was promptly ignored and I continued to get invited to events and told that I was manipulative for making them choose. To be clear the things that made me not want to be around this girl were her: calling me being sexually assaulted \"drama\", asking me to delete all the texts between us off my phone incase I try to use them against her, when I told her I was seeing someone new and had moved on (I asked her out once or twice) she promptly got pissed and later claimed \"oh I was jealous you got to date her not me\"\n\nI feel most people would understand someone not wanting to be around a person who behaved like the above. However that's only a small part of the issue. I have been on a study abroad for about a month and a half, and the person I was seeing, my friends, and a lot my acquaintances have gone silent. It's only the ones that I shared with the person in question. So I am freaking out and think its a bit suspicious that this happened while I'm gone. With the person I was seeing I'm really hoping it's a result of me not handling a fight well but with everyone else I don't know what the hell is going on.\n\nThe last fight I had with the emotionally abusive friend was I had a hinge and I matched with someone who this friend (I thought) told me about and who I have a lot of mutuals with. So I told them \"hey we know some of the same people would it be awkward for you if something happened between us?\" At which point they ask who and I give them a list and there was a name on that list they didn't recognize. It was the name of the EAF. The EAF then claims she never told me about this person but I remember pretty clearly at least getting a name and a mention 2 or 3 times. So it becomes this issue of I ruined a potential friendship and shit and how I always reach out to fuck something up for them and me being the idiot I am says \"well a lot of times I've reached out because I felt you violated a boundary or hurt me\" big mistake makes the situation worse.\n\nAfter this fight person I was seeing asks for space, other friends go silent and I'm in a foreign country trying to ask what the fuck is going on with no way to process or handle this shit and just wow. I will argue I displayed codependent tendencies and fucked up some times but I just don't understand how my friends could ignore so many red flags or me asking for help so often and then what this person must have said to them that they don't even want to talk to me anymore?\n\nLike fuck half the time I'd be attacked for doing something she'd ask me to do but nah no nope clearly not a red flag.

I go back and forth between 1) finding his actions to be romantic and just masculine ENTJ behavior and 2) his actions being inappropriate as he abused his powers as the principal of the school.\n\nHe was married and recently had a kid. He would pretend he was not married around me, though, as he would take his ring of whenever I interned. He think he thought I was dumb and was amused when I did airhead things like bump into walls, get overly excited and act confused/fearful in his presence. I think I fed his ego whenever i got submissive around and needed his help because I seemed so incapable. When in reality a lot of me seeming incapable also had to do with him making me feel so dysregulated because my PTSD symptoms would act up around him. He wouldn\u2019t take no for answer and did not respect boundaries. He was impulsive, quick to anger, and one time belittled me and told me he couldn't see me in the profession I was going to school for after I continuously avoided/rejected him. He often treated me like I was amusing because I was incapable and he didn\u2019t really respect me but you could tell he thought i was cute and preferred me silly, submissive, and dumb. When I wasn\u2019t my silly self and was serious, assertive and intelligent, he seemed shocked and less attracted to me. \n\nOne time he touched my leg while saying good morning and another time he touched my waist to lean in to hear what I was saying. Another time he grabbed my shoulders while  He walked down the hall way. He became very jealous when I talked to other male coworkers and one time he told off a male coworker and eyed me down like he owned me as I walked back into my office. He tried to intimidate me and didn\u2019t like when I challenged his authority. I felt like he treated me like property even though I was in no way his and he was married! But he also protected me at times from my rude supervisor and when I was down, I could tell he would be sad and cared about me. But I also feel like he would get down when I was down because it meant I wouldn\u2019t give him attention. When I rejected him, he didn\u2019t take it well and it made him very emotionally dysregulated---extreme sadness, anger, etc. Then he started harassing another female coworker after I rejected him and she tried resisting his advances. But then she started liking him because he is so charming and then i got jealous and asked her if she was okay. She knew that I knew and immediately ended the affair with the principal.\n\nAround him, my ptsd hypervigilance kicked in to protect me because he was not a safe person and was unstable (could have had borderline personality. I avoided him because he was married also scary because of his angry and commanding energy (but I also was so drawn to that energy). Ultimately, I rejected him because I knew I would crumble if he ended up hurting me. Yes, I was attracted to him and admired him for his leadership and work ethic. Also, being around him made me feel so feminine because we were pretty different/polarizing. He was also confident and stereotypically masculine. Plus I admired him so much--so hard working, dominant, and powerful. Plus I liked his sense of humor. While I was often scared of him, I also think i fell in love with him during my internship and I haven\u2019t liked someone that much since (2 years ago) . I feel like he saw the worst flawed parts of me and still liked me and kept fighting to be with me.\n\nOn the last day of my internship, he kept trying to be around me and stare at me. At one point, my supervisor  rudely asked him what he was staring at. He asked me to help him with something and then he told me I was always welcome at his school. Then my supervisor came in because she could tell he was trying to talk to me.. And then he walked away because he had to go pick up his daughter. I told him thank you. That was the last time I talked to him. I loved him.\n\n\nSo my question: was this sexual abuse or typical ENTJ masculine behavior? Or both? Maybe this is unhealthy ENTJ/masculine behavior?

This morning my sister called to tell me that she was in town (lives about 3 hours away) to visit her grandmother and had gotten a call from mom saying she was staying with boyfriend's sister after boyfriend choked her yesterday. At this point i basically said ok when are we going to get her. I'm waiting to hear back from sister about today's plan, but beyond that i'm clueless. Sister is going to take mom to stay with her, (i'm closer but don't have room) but i want to be prepared for what's to come. Mom apparently told her all the usual \"he's not usually like that, he's helpless without me, can't even make himself a cup of coffee without my help, i'm sure it won't happen again\" bullshit. Frankly we don't care what happens to him. I know that only mom can file a report and the decision to leave is ultimately up to her. Any heads up or things i need to do or say on my part would be greatly appreciated. My mom has always been independent and strong, and to think of her being abused by this piece of trash has me paralyzed. Thanks in advance for being there for each other.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He backed me up against the window. He grabbed my arm and made me touch his dick, and said \u201cyou touched my dick now I get to touch your fanny.\u201d For those who don\u2019t know fanny is British for vagina. He told me that I was now his girlfriend because of this. I believed him. We weren\u2019t close at all after that, and we hadn\u2019t really been before then. But he later became my step cousin. He is still unfortunately in my life.\n\nWhen I was 16 I got drunk at a house party. I was put to bed, and I woke up with a \u201cfriends\u201d fingers inside of me while my best friend in the world lay in the bed beside us, feeling betrayed because she fancied the boy who was assaulting me. It hurt like nothing I had experienced at that point, and it sobered me up sharp. I remember thinking, \u201cit\u2019s okay it\u2019ll be over soon, just put up with it and it will eventually end.\u201d I then apologised to my friend because she had stormed out, and told her I had been asleep. This seemed 100% normal and like I was the one who fucked up, and I still believe that more than l wish I did.\n\nLast year, at 27 after difficulties with stalkers and generally creepy people I thought I was past it. On a night out with friends, they\u2019re walking me halfway towards my train where my husband worked, and to the bar they were walking to. A man asked me for directions on his phone, and he started to grope me, while my drunk friends failed to notice. And again, I told myself that it would eventually end and that I only needed to endure it a short while. After, when he was leaving, my friends jeered me and made me give this guy a cuddle before he went on his way. I told a friend days later when I burst into tears in work. She told me it was my fault for allowing it.\n\nLast September, my baby unfortunately died in the womb and had to be medically removed. The surgery went wrong. I was slipping in and out of consciousness from the pain, and haemorrhaging blood from my vagina. I have never seen that much blood in my life. \n\nThis surgery triggered PTSD after I took a period unexpectedly and went to the toilet and found blood I hadn\u2019t expected. I was then referred to a councillor. She said it sounded like I wad went into flight mode, and I wondered when else I had done this.\n\nThen it hit me. This fear. A fear so real and so horrendous I\u2019m still fucking afraid this very minute. My father\u2019s family are pure scum. Vile, twisted scummy humans. I remember staying in the kids bedroom in my grandmothers only once, and being too scared to stay again but not remembering why. I remember the fucking wallpaper, and the print is seared into my goddamn brain. I remember the bunk beds. The disgusting, foul bunk beds. I hated staying there, but I only remember doing it once. I also only remember my uncle once, and it was the last time I saw him. I was about 14, and it was accidental in the street. I knew I knew him, but I had and still have no memories of this man. Some days I know in my heart he hurt me and I\u2019ve buried it. Some days I fully know he hurt my cousins too. Some days I\u2019m fine and forget my fear and think \u201cmust have imagined it all because if that had happened to me surely I would remember?\u201d\n\nChrist this has turned into an essay. I\u2019ve never laid it all out before. My husband does not know, he physically can\u2019t bring himself to hear it. The new memories or whatever the fuck they are have really messed me up the last few months. I\u2019ve told him I know in my soul something has happened, and I\u2019ve tried to tell him why, like me being terrified when a door is closed and I\u2019m inside with whoever did it, how having my arm grabbed nearly sends me into panic attack. He can\u2019t hear it, so won\u2019t. I can\u2019t tell anyone, not really. Not all of it. I seen a community mental health nurse who referred me as a special case to a branch of psychology dealing with sexual abuse for this and other reasons I gave about my childhood with that side of the family.

The abuse has continued. He said that divorcing me would lift a huge weight off his shoulders, but when he calls me a gold digger and I ask then why he is with me, he doesn\u2019t have an answer. I believe he views the marriage as a status, something he can brag about it to others, to make he feel better about himself. I don\u2019t think he knows what a healthy relationship is about. That doesn\u2019t matter to him. \n\nSorry if it sound like I\u2019m rumbling, in just extremely frustrated.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I didn't realize how dependant on me I let him get, thus really hurting him when I eventually pulled out abruptly (to him..). It was selfish of me to stay even though I was doubting it. I don't know.

Thoughts run through my mind like \u201cwhat if you get stuck in an abusive situation again\u201d and \u201chow do you know this is love? what is love? how do you possibly know they are THE ONE?\u201d \n\nMy partner is the most understanding and patient person I have ever known. The beginning of the relationship was hard with my past but it didn\u2019t feel so suffocating. My anxiety about the future was not so overwhelming when we were just starting out. I do not want to lose this person. I do love them, but I feel myself shutting down for my own protection.\n\nAnyone else struggling with intimacy/commitment after abuse? I feel crazy when so many of my peers are settling down and saying with all certainty that they\u2019ve found \u201cthe one\u201d while I am not convinced I can ever have that feeling after trauma because of my PTSD/anxiety/depression.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

After that, I obsessively journaled and recorded every piece of \"evidence\" that I was experiencing abuse. I'd highlight items on lists of abusive behavior and write down all of my experiences that matched. I think I initially did this to prove it to myself that there was abuse, as I was still actively being gaslit. I also think I was doing this in large part because I was desperate for *him* to realize what he was doing. In my mind he wouldn't be able to deny hard facts if presented with them. But whenever I tried to confront him he would deny, deflect, gaslight, etc. It was infuriating and exhausting. Towards the end I took him to couple's therapy, which I now know wouldn't have worked, and he blamed me for his behavior and did all of the same things *in front of the therapist.* She told me privately she was concerned because she \"saw it happen right in front of her.\" The second she used the word \"abusive\" in a subsequent session, where she told him that his behavior can be considered abuse, he decided that the therapist \"wasn't impartial\" and refused to attend any further sessions. He did continue on his campaign to convince me that he'd done nothing wrong, though. At one point he brought out a printed copy of one of the articles I'd read, which I'd highlighted/taken notes on and shared with him in therapy, and was trying to argue bit by bit that everything I highlighted and wrote wasn't true.\n\nI finally left after an outburst he had in the car with me. I told him to drive more slowly because I was anxious about the speed. He can't take criticism or anything he perceives to be criticism and started screaming, swearing, and repeatedly punching the dashboard. He white-knuckled the steering wheel, at one point pushing 90, as I cried and begged him to stop. He felt no remorse, and later tried to justify his actions by essentially saying \"well, I just hit the dashboard, not you,\" and maintaining that that was an acceptable, healthy expression of anger.\n\nI have a hard time talking about the abuse because I feel like if I don't share every single detail or present information the right way, people won't see it's abuse, validate it or take it seriously. For that same reason, I've been wavering on making this post for like 6 weeks, because I know I can't include everything and I'm so exhausted by the thought of trying.  I don't feel like anyone understands, and that my experience pales in comparison to people who have experienced far worse. I'm panicking over posting this, honestly, because realistically I can only share a small snapshot of the situation. I'm not sure how to end this either. I just need someone to *get it*. I don't feel like I belong here but I'm reeling and I'm hurting and I'm so, so angry. I WAS abused, so why am I struggling with this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry this is so long.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

This one is about a friend of mine. So I am living in a very bad apartment complex. I wouldn't come out of my apartment for months and finally one day I was getting my mail and a couple people said Hi to me, thus began me coming down to the lobby more. I have a lot of issues as well, anxiety, ptsd, depression, bipolar etc... so this is a HUGE step for me. Well, after a few days one of my new friends, who is about 60? I think, offers to teach me how to play pool (as I haven't played since I was 10.) So we're playing and talking and a couple other friends are there as well. I confide in my new friend, telling him about my past and how I'm fearful and he promises to teach me self defense. Fast foward to the next day, he usually comes down by 1-2 it's about 5. So our other friend is worried and calls him and hes with his gf, who lives somewhere else right now. The friend on the phone, let's call her.. Jenny, the guy in question we'll call him Todd, and his gf we'll call Connie. So, Jenny asks where he is and he explains hes with Connie and won't be home for about another hour. So Jenny goes \"Okay, was just worried about you\" and I chime in \"Me Too!!\" in a playful squeaky voice. Well Connie did not like this and instantly starts calling me a Bitch and a Homewrecker and telling Todd \"You Better stay away from that fucking whore!\" and then yells at me through the phone \"Listen BITCH! Stay away from my man!\" At this point, Jenny is cracking up as she's never seen Connie this jealous. I don't think it's funny and offer to talk to Connie face to face civilly to assure her that I am just an overweight, unattractive 27 year old woman who literally only wants to be friends with your 60 yr old man. (She's 72).  She ignores me and continues slinging insult after insult until she eventually hangs up after telling him if he plays pool with me again they're done. So he comes back and I wave and throw a paper ball that says \"Hi\" in it. She said to stay away and not TALK. Nothing about notes and throwing them :P He was not amused. Jenny and I could tell something was wrong and realized a yellow mark on his face. He said it was nothing and just went upstairs doing his best to avoid me. The next day when he gets his mail, this yellow mark had formed into a full fledged bruise. Jenny and I both go over and ask wtf happened and he does the typical \"Oh, I don't know.. I must have fallen, or hit myself in my sleep. I don't know what you're talking about\" blah blah blah. Being a victim of domestic violence, I know the excuses and the lies and the cover ups bc you \"love\" your partner so much. Jenny and I try to convince him to go to the police and he just keeps saying \"Connie didn't do anything, that't just how she is, she can't help it, she's a wildcat\". Well... sadly, Jenny and I can't prove anything and Todd refuses to tell. Now Connie controls EVERYTHING with him. Even though she doesn't live with him he's not allowed to do anything without her permission. Not even take out his own money from the bank, not even leave his apartment. If he doesn't get the mail on time she thinks hes fucking someone. But of course \"She's not manipulating or controlling, she's doing it bc she loves me\". Nothing we can do. We wait about a week and when he comes back there's more bruises on him. We confront him about it and he denies it of course. I ask him if he genuinely wants me to leave him alone or since she doesn't live there, just continue being friends. He says \"Well I want to be friends, but it would just be easier to avoid you until this blows over\". I get upset, I have a bit of a temper, and go cool off in the pouring rain, crying my eyes out. I'm not mad at HIM per se, just mad that he won't see that he's allowed to be friends with whoever tf he wan'ts to be friends with. So I come back in and hes standing there with Jenny yelling at him for making me cry. I tell Jenny to calm down and it's alright. Well Todd is now apologizing and about to call Connie to which I tell him not to bc, let's face it , it will only get worse. So he pulls out his epi-pen and says \"Well, maybe if something happens to be god forbid and you save me she'll learn to like you\" and I just look at him and go \"Look, I don't want anything happening to you okay, I'll just stay away. Couple days go by. He comes down to the lobby and sits down and starts twitching and shaking and we think he either is having a stroke or got stung or something. He barely has enough energy to get his epi-pen out and it falls to the floor. Mind you there are like 10+ people in the lobby and NO ONE is trying to help him other than Me and Jenny. Jenny doesn't know how to use an epi-pen, and whereas i know HOW to use one, i never have. So i just take the cap off, jab it in his leg and the initial body shock gave me ptsd, I can't stop seeing his face now, but I digress. He was taken to the hospital for a few days. (Not sure it he did something on purpose or if it was just coincidental, But I'm gonna say he ate something he wasn't supposed to or something like that). So Connie finds out he's in the hospital. Doesn't care that he's there, doesn't care he almost died. No. She cares if my number is in his phone (which it's not but I wish it was) because if if was they were broken up for good. Well i was out of town when he got back so when I saw him i greeted him and was like \"Hi! I'm so glad you're alright, welcome back!\" Nothing. He won't even look in my general direction. Which fucking hurts. So I go back to sit with Jenny and since then every time he goes to see Connie, he comes back with bruises. There's no way to prove it though. I just don't know what to do at this point. I can't stand people being in bad situations / relationships especially when you are that blind to what's going on. thanks for letting me rant guys. sorry for the grammar errors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR : Friend being manipulated, controlled and physically abused by gf but he won't admit it and we can't prove it.

His anger got worse when I was in 11th grade - I was 16 and he was 20. \n\n  When we were younger, he would go out of his way to annoy me and my mom always brushed it off saying it was just sibling teasing. I learned to keep quiet because any time I told on him, it would backfire and my mom would blame me for being in the same room as him, or going near him. Although he was the one who would follow me. \n\nI didn\u2019t really like being around him. It could be that he used to touch me at night. I was terrified of the dark as a child (still am somewhat) and he would use this fear to get me into his bed (we had a bunk bed and he would grab my leg from down, snickering) I would literally be sweating under the blanket, unable to sleep for most of the night. \n\nI never told my mom because I knew she\u2019d blame me for going to his bed and I thought it was my fault. This continued until I was 13 when we moved to a new house and my mom was on the same bed so I wasn\u2019t afraid to make him stop. I pushed him away forcefully and he didn\u2019t really try it again. \n\nI thought I could put this behind us, telling myself he was just a kid when this happened and he probably had no idea what he was doing (I was 7/8 and he was 12/13. It continued until I was 10, when he was put in a boarding school - he moved back home when I was 13) \n\n. But I had always hated him touching me, whether it be a hug or a kiss on my cheek. I absolutely to this day hate it. My mom would always say I was cold hearted and didn\u2019t know how to be affectionate. That I wasn\u2019t capable of love. So I would kind of force myself to sit through it although I hated it. He never seemed uncomfortable around me like I was. He didn\u2019t seem to regret what he did to me. \n\nHis physical hits started as shoving. He didn\u2019t go all in. He would throw things on the ground during his fights with my mom. I would always intervene and try to diffuse the situation. Sometimes this would backfire and he would take his anger out on me. He\u2019d slap me a few times. \n\nThere would be times he\u2019d get mad when I\u2019d touch his desktop. Our father told us we had to share it - my brother already had two phones and a laptop to himself. I had a phone but it didn\u2019t connect to the internet so that was my only way to connect to the internet. He would get angry when I\u2019d use it and would hit me. So I stopped using it that much. When I turned 16 my dad said I could have something so I asked for a camera instead of a phone. \n\nOne day he took my camera with him outside without telling me. I was annoyed and I called my Dad to tell him. My brother returned in 10 minutes threw my camera on the couch and grabbed me by my shirt to throw me on the ground. He kept kicking me until I curled up on the floor. The whole time my mom was watching, she didn\u2019t try to stop him.\n\nAfterwards when I asked her why she didn\u2019t stop him, she said it was my fault and I shouldn\u2019t have told my Dad in the first place. I remember there would be occasions she would tell him to hit me. Most of my memories are kind of vague, but i had abookshelf in my room. My mom took away the lock to my room so every time I would run away from him or her, I would push the bookshelf over it. \n\nHe kicked down my door once. She still refused to put the bolt. So I started to move the bed in front of the door which i could only do because I\u2019d be charged with adrenaline. That managed to stop them a lot of times. \n\nI started telling this to my college counsellor only a few months ago. I had never told anyone any of it before. She diagnosed me with CPTSD. \n\nThere\u2019s so many other things he\u2019d do. He would call me a bitch,  a whore. He continuously made fun of my appearance. My mom would tell me \u201cto stop taking everything so seriously\u201d she\u2019d keep saying I was jealous of him. That I was evil and heartless. Both of them would say that I have an awful personality and that no one could ever like me. \n\nI did find it difficult to hold on to friends but that was because I moved so much as a child. I changed six schools and skipped eighth grade. \n\nI am in my holidays right now. And so much of what I repressed is coming up. I am trying to come to terms with that fact that I had been abused. I have been researching CPTSD ever since then and everything fits but there\u2019s a lot of things I had repressed that I am trying to remember. \n\nI want to cut things off with everyone in my family. I don\u2019t want anything to do with them. I feel guilty for feeling this way, but this is how I would constantly feel as a 9 year old. This is how I felt as a 13 year old. And this is how I feel now (20, I come home for holidays) \n\nThere\u2019s a part of me that feels like maybe I am being too selfish/immature/heartless for wanting to do so.

From doing research I\u2019ve identified that he has a cluster b personality. I never gave into this man\u2019s advances because he has a girlfriend. I feel like me denting his ego/ his sexual frustration at me not giving in has made him conduct his smear campaign with full force. It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to punish me.\n\nDue to a number of occurrences that are too many to just be a coincidence, I have suspicions that\u2019s he\u2019s hacked into my phone and social media accounts, as well as my personal emails, and that he somehow can track my location. There\u2019s been times when I\u2019ve \u2018bumped into\u2019 him outside work, and there was a time when I crossed paths with one of his flying monkeys outside work.\nI\u2019ve even gone to the police but they said there\u2019s nothing they can do because I don\u2019t have any concrete evidence; it\u2019s all just \u2018coincidences\u2019.\n\nIn the guy\u2019s leaving speech, he made an innuendo about me being a virgin, When I went back to work the Monday after he left, I started to hear all these rumours about me and my family.  People also think that I was involved with him sexually, which I find really offensive because I would never do anything sexual with someone who\u2019s taken. I feel like he told people this information about me at his leaving drinks which I didn\u2019t attend, or he could be spreading it through flying monkey colleagues.  I can tell that some of the information has been found from mine and my family\u2019s social media, but there\u2019s other really personal things I\u2019ve heard that I\u2019ve only shared in convos with my friends outside of work. I\u2019m even starting to suspect these friends who don\u2019t even know the guy.  That\u2019s why I think maybe he\u2019s hacked my phone with a mic or something, because these friends have never met him. I know it sounds crazy. There\u2019s also one lady at who works on my floor, who\u2019s known me since I was little, because I went to primary and secondary school with her daughter.  I think she\u2019s definitely added information to the rumours.\n\nThere was a time when he sent round a suggestive email to our whole dept, in order to try and get my attention. This made me lose sleep for days and wake up with my heart racing, because I hate being the centre of attention. I was ill -advised by  someone to confront him about this. This is not what not what I initially wanted to do. The person who gave me this advice thought he was trying to mock me, so I confronted him angrily. I nearly got fired and had to say I projected all of my personal problems onto him to keep my job. This meant he continued harassing me brazenly up until he left. I know he\u2019s definitely told people about that altercation, and has painted me as someone who\u2019s batshit crazy.  \n\nThe week after he left, all the rumours were flying around about me and my family, and my colleagues were doing everything to try and push my buttons. It felt like the whole floor had ganged up against me, and were constantly making digs at me. It reached breaking point last Thursday when someone made a comment about a monkey tree (I\u2019m black). I couldn\u2019t bear to be there anymore so I packed up my stuff, and since then have been off work due to stress.\n\nI\u2019m a member of a trade union, and my rep is very supportive. I\u2019ve signed up to occupational health and am going to tell them everything about the situation I\u2019ve been in. Apparently they can talk with my managers about how to make me feel more comfortable at work. My union guy said he\u2019s going to try and get my managers to tell people to calm down on the gossip. Once they\u2019ve done that I feel like can think about going back to work. \n\nThis is such a frustrating situation because NO ONE understands. With the harassment I was told I was reading into it too much, when people could see that the guy would persistently follow me around the office. It makes me so angry and upset that no one ever tried to step in. And then I get told that I\u2019m reading into things too much when everyone saw what he was doing right in front of them!\n\nWith the bullying/mobbing/ gossip it\u2019s the same thing.

Before this I never took a day sick from work, but all the bullying has really taken its toll on me. It\u2019s like I\u2019m scared to go back. \n\nI thought I\u2019d gotten over the hard part by managing to resist the guy\u2019s advances for so long ( he was 6 foot 7 in height and extremely good looking), but since he\u2019s left everything\u2019s gotten worse. \n\nI feel like there\u2019s no point in having hope, I\u2019m trying not to get suicidal, but I feel like my life keeps going downhill.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I so badly wanted to tell them why they shouldn't do that to me.  What it did to me and how I felt about it.  Unfortunately I didn't and they went through with it.  I don't know first-hand what it feels like to be overtly sexually abused but I imagine the experience I went through was similar to some extent.  I've never felt so sexually violated as I before, during and after that spanking.  The fact that it was at the hands of my parents and they were completely oblivious made it worse for me.  I've since embraced this fetish of mine instead of pretending it doesn't exist and hoping it goes away but the memory of being spanked by my parents that one particular time still horrifies me.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

We were discussing their boyfriends, etc.  Much to my surprise he said, \"Girls, never ever put up with 1. Cheating 2. Lying or 3. Hitting.\"\n\nI mean, he's not wrong. But I almost choked because, of course, any of us would have probably defaulted to saying \"3. Abuse\".  By using the word hitting, he is differentiating between the expected toleration within the types of abuse. \n\nThis may not surprise you at all, but he has been especially reactive when I've labeled something he has said or done as being (emotionally) abusive.  He either simply rejects the concept or expects that any words that he feels like saying should be tolerated. It only  makes sense that he naturally defaults to warning against a relationship partner who \"hits\" vs. \"is abusive\" in general. The underlying message is, if he's not hitting you, it's fine, deal with it. Or maybe it's just easy for me to read into this, given my circumstances. \n\nAt this point in time, I wanted to issue a correction to his statement re: hitting vs. abuse. But I decided that this was a conversation better had in private with them. He knows what my views are on the subject. Any correction would have been taken as a direct attack and threat to his sense of security, which was just not worth it given the timing and audience. \n\nReading this post back to myself, it occurs to me that perhaps I'm being overly sensitive to a general statement.

This is going to be a bit long! Any feedback would be really nice!  :) (Related or not) \n\nFirsts off all, here's some key info: I'm a single child, and jewish. I'm 15, and a sophomore going to junior. Another thing is that I had a girlfriend, who for some reason or another fell off of the face of the earth. Three weeks go by with no communication and I'm like \"Ok, I get the memo.\" I relied on my twin (non-biological) to get through it, and he suddenly says he likes me. Of course I don't feel like that, and he ends up telling me he can't be my friend anymore and leaves. My depression (I've been struggling for a very long time with it) hits me and I go on some random site and find this dude. He's like \"Feeling bad? Lemme come over\" and being a spontaneous lil thing I'm like \"I don't even care\" He comes over and we get in a relationship (I didn't lose my vaginal virginity). \n\nTwo weeks later my dad walks in while I'm in the bathroom and he blows up, I'm talking, had a gun up to my head, screaming, my mom is hysterical, all that shit. The next day he says \"Fuck it, we all mistakes, I've made worse.\" and forgives me. Everything got better from there. My relationship with my parents has always been rocky with them and I honestly don't exactly regret what I did, because my relationship with my parents got better because of it. And I have no idea, but I ALWAYS seem to get in toxic relationships? (Not with my ex-girlfriend, who I had known for 5 years). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, our relationship started in September\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay.\n\nThis happens about to weeks after everything above. For years I've been an avid gamer, I'm talking addicted, and I don't post nearly at all on social media, if at all, add that to not having any friends, AND a single kid, a friend comes with no questions. I had known him, but never liked him (he always trash talked me) and so when he texts out of the blue I blow him off. A few days go by and I decide to bother texting him back. He's actually nice! It's been years since I had even talked to him, so that came at a surprise! We talk and he tells me how he's been obsessed with me, and is always thinking about me and yadda yadda, whatever, I don't believe it, and being a little emotionless I'm just like \"Eh.\" \n\nI didn't have any feeling, like not at all, telling him that I didn't feel comfortable. SURPRISE! He pressures me into getting into a relationship. Everything is going well (as well as an xbox relationship can), and for the next 3 months we don't even fight, not a single one, until something really stupid set him off. Fortnite.  I can admit it, I WAS shit, like. Doodoo cheeks. I don't take games seriously, they're GAMES so, I did little things that bothered him, sometimes intentionally, sometimes not. Ex: Laughing at him getting domed/A yelling laughter/a boogie bomb when he's trying to snipe someone. Our arguments get more frequent, and then we meet (He lives in the same state). Everything is perfect, we go home, and he complains about every little thing I do.. Even going so far as to tell me my laugh was stupid. then we break up. That didn't last long, as he starts telling me it's my fault, which I was adamant it wasn't. Over the last few months we start getting serious, but my mental state is starting to wear thin, and I confessed to him that I thought I was schizophrenic, and he just HAAAD to say things like \"Yeah, I think I might be too.\" and \"Don't worry, it's probably nothing.\" At this point we fight practically every day. But he still tells me he loves me, and cares, and he's sorry he acts like this. I can't help but tell him \"We'll work it out, i forgive you, I just really really REALLY need you to stop doing it\" He tells me to shut up, that it's \"not your fault\" but then gives me every reason why it is, and is always being angsty. He moved across country recently, but I can't keep blaming his behaviour on this. He gets upset over one little thing I say, and won't tell me anything, practically making me beg to know so I can resolve it. I'm a night owl, so I don't stay up during the day with him, which he's upset about. Another thing is his possessiveness over me. It was okay at first but he won't let me talk to anyone without making me feel bad about it. He told me I spent too much time with my mother, and ANYTIME someone texts me he demeans them. He has all my passwords and reads all my conversation, even going so far as to tell them to fuck off and that they're never there for me. Don't even get me started on my prom night, where I went alone had a bad time, and he still rubs in my face that he TOOLD me it would be horrible, along with a bid time with my ex twin and ex girlfriend.\n\nI need help, I do anything and I'm trying to help our relationship but honestly, can anyone help me?

I struggled with this deeply in the decade that I spent with my abuser (sociopathic narcissist), also somewhat so in the first couple of years following my leaving. I thought I would share my conclusions about this in the hopes of helping some of you who are still struggling. \n\nYour narcissist will NEVER feel the way that you want them to feel about the abuses you\u2019ve endured. They are largely incapable of feeling remorse, except their OWN feelings of loss/betrayal/ etc. They can justify anything that they do for themselves without remorse. We often convince ourselves that if we could just force them to see the truths that they will feel genuinely remorseful and subsequently change and behave the way we wish they would. This is not possible because we are objectified by our narcissists. We, in their minds, belong to them, to do with as they see fit. They are incapable of truly empathizing and feeling genuine compassion. They feign compassion and empathy in order to gain control and then the abuse cycle is repeated. This is the crux of \u201cbeing in love\u201d with a narcissist, especially if you are an empath.\n\nI had to let go of the desire to BE VALIDATED BY MY NARCISSIST. Think about it: that\u2019s what we want. We want our pain to be validated by our abusers. Then, we win. Then, we\u2019ve rescued them from themselves and the fantasy is complete. Right? \n\nWrong. It\u2019s a lie. They will never validate our realities or see us as people. If they humanize us, they cannot complete their abuse cycles. Our narcissists are disgusted by us. Narcissists feel superior to everyone. When in a relationship with a narcissist, you are a tool for their fulfillment, a plaything, a minion, more lowly than a pet. \n\nValidate your own pain. Practice control, when you can, over your own thinking. Understand that there is no \u201cfixing a narcissist\u201d and that you may have to leave things feeling conclusionless with them. You have to care more about your feelings, your life, your being than theirs, the lack of which is why most of us ended up with narcs to begin with. \n\nWe don\u2019t know how to properly love ourselves. In secret, we mask the hatred that we have for ourselves and the closest thing that we manifest to self-love is self-pity. We use them to beat ourselves up because somewhere in our minds, we feel like that is what we deserve. We feel like we deserve the abuse. \n\nLeaving a narcissist is making the choice to love yourself again. It\u2019s taking the time to delve into the hard truths as to why you don\u2019t feel like you deserve healthy love, in order to truly heal. It won\u2019t happen all at once and you will indeed have withdrawals from the trauma bonding. Healthy lives aren\u2019t always stimulating like drama and you have to learn to embrace the lack of drama. You most stop feeding the delusion that you aren\u2019t in control. You have to stop feeling worthless and no one can do that for you, but you. \n\nIf you trust in this principle, the help will be there when you need it. The support will be there. The validations from others will be there as soon as you admit that your pain is indeed validated within yourself. Before you know it, you won\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d that cycle from the narc to define you, nor will you need them to punish you.

Living was torture but I truly didn\u2019t believe that I had any value without him. \n\nAnd then something changed. I started to succeed in my career and get praise and validation there. The people I worked with gave me the confidence to be the type of person who could pull themselves away from a bad situation instead of going down with the ship. I realized that it wasn\u2019t my responsibility to save him or fix him, I needed to do all of that for myself. \n\nMonths later I\u2019m still struggling with the trauma this relationship caused me and I feel like people around me are somewhat confused about this. I think they assumed that when I left this relationship I\u2019d be a rocket ship taking off and I\u2019m just not. I\u2019m suffering. I also don\u2019t know how to relate to these people. I could enlighten them to the details of abuse that are causing me to suffer, but I don\u2019t want to distress them like that. I know they care, I just don\u2019t think they fully understand how deep and dark things were. I was very good at leading a \u201cdouble life\u201d and keeping the abuse a secret. I think this is also something that confuses people. I seemed alright, maybe tired, maybe a bit sad, but I don\u2019t think anyone really expected that my home life was so extreme. \n\nI feel their disappointment and some of them even express it to me when I mention not feeling well emotionally. I see a therapist who is amazing and patient. I just wish I didn\u2019t have to pay for that kind of understanding. How do I make my loved ones understand?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I'm also likely forgetting details but i will add any i remember in the morning.\n\nHi, any replies would be helpful. I'm 17 years old, and for the past year i've started to notice my mothers behaviour being abusive. I have 2 younger brothers and my mother who i live with, and i see my dad once a week. He's definitely abusive, which is why i dont want to see him, but i have been certain of that for years so i won't get into it here.\n\nI've had no privacy since I was little, my mum will look through my phone or diaries or social media etc and say it's fine because i'm her child and that she's allowed to do that. She found out I was bisexual when I was about 12 - 13 and pressured me to admit it, then telling me i couldn't tell until I had sex so it was definitely a phase. After that she claimed my online friends were grooming me and convincing me I was gay and depressed to make it easier to prey on me (they definitely weren't and she had no proof that they were, we mainly talked about video games and had not mentioned explicit sexual things further than teenagers joking or meeting eachother irl). She took away my phone and laptop until I was 16, and i dropped out of school for a year due to extreme anxiety, which i believe was caused by her and my dad.\n\nWhen i was very little she told us if we were bad she'd tie us to a chair or lock us in our room, which i only remembered recently and I think is pretty fucked. \n\nIf I try to go out she interrogates me asking to talk to whoever i'm meeting's parents and also refuses to believe me if i say i'm just going out on my own. If i go out while she's out she accuses me of lieing or tells me I should have gone with an adult. This has made it very difficult to make friends. \n\nI was diagnosed with a disability the other year which she only talks about to others to make herself look better and often tells me she doesnt think I actually have said disability even though i've been diagnosed with it, because it's not a physical disability. She also tells people everything i've been through despite me repeatedly asking her not to for pity.\n\nShe is trying to convince me not to leave for university next year by telling me i wouldnt cope away from home due to my disability (which she only talks about when it benefits her) and my anxiety, she also uses the fact that I was harassed/stalked for a year by a guy to convince me that going is unsafe. She insists im too vulnerable to leave.\n\nAbout a month ago she told me she had a nightmare that I ran away in the middle of the night and made me promise not to do that and not to leave her while she was nearly crying and holding me, which made me super uncomfortable and guilty and felt like she was manipulating me. She also often apologises for being a bad mother until I reassure her she isnt a bad mother to make her stop. I think this is guilt tripping me. If i ever mention anything she does wrong she either does this or starts talking about everything she \"sacrificed\" for us.\n\nShe also makes me act like a parent to my brothers, and doesnt hold them to the same standard that she does to me, she is a lot nicer to them and not as strict. \n\nShe is very unpredictable and i feel on edge constantly while around her like she could snap at anytime . Am i overdramatic or is this emotional abuse?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Me and my friends saw him and his enabler friend drive past us. He called me with his normal voice and revealed some infos about me that are relatively hard to get (or maybe not that hard to get I don't know how). It seriously fucked with my head. The rest of the evening I had this hard feeling of paranoia and all those old feelings came up. This sense of inferiority and low self worth. I never experienced anything similar in my life. I didn't have any contact with him for a whole year. Why do people do this stuff. I tried to be passive aggressive when we talked on the phone but that stuff doesn't work with these people. I realized I can't win the game he is playing with me. The only way to win it is by just not playing the game. These people aren't better than me. If the only way he can feel better about himself is by stalking and making fun of me then it just shows how pathetic he is.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When he realized he would never win back my heart he started raping me again, taking my pictures and making it so that he would forever own me, my body and put me in debt to him that he created.  He made me agree to all sorts of things on the condition that I would still be his sex toy after I left him, and that I would take out a loan to share an apartment with him, and any future partner I ever had was to be either shared or approved of by him.  When I escaped, his entire family came at me, he tried to kill me and treated me like a mental case trying to institutionalize me and make it so no one wanted to help me.  I was isolated, hunted down, he would steal all my things while I was on the street and hold it ransom until I payed him my paychecks or did what he wanted.

I wasn\u2019t allowed to complain, to be depressed to be sick or show anything contrary to what he wanted.

I had been trained to do this as a child and with my ex husband.  I kept on going and soon we ended up with 3 kids.  He accuses me of cheating, treats me like trash and calls me by his most horrible ex\u2019s names.  He doesn\u2019t ever listen to me or value me as a human being and controls who I talk to especially on the phone.  Just talking with my best friend set him off a few days ago.  He talked me down from leaving and yelling at me like I was a fucking bitch who had this planned all along.  I said I\u2019m done finally and tried packing as he kept throwing my things back out.

He specifically told me \"you're so young. I'm mature now. I'm wiser than you\" and other condescending shit. He was definitely drunk too, despite claiming several times that he no longer drank after \\~seeing the world\\~ and tried to rub in how miserable and awful i was to him. So, instead of defending myself, instead of wanting to make myself understood to him, i gave up. I agreed. I became what he told people I was, and mixed up his expectations. He told me he never loved me and was simply lying to manipulate me, and I responded saying that my bad behavior was bc he said he loved me, and i was trying to push him away from me. I made him feel rejected, finally, so he tried to shift view onto him after briefly cussing me out: he said he had changed his lifestyle because he had a \\~disease\\~.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nand you know he made me GUESS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, i was genuinely worried until i realized it was another ploy, another pull to get me wrapped up in him again.

I realized that I could no longer cling to my animosity, or hatred, and that he was this awful person and not at all the person my loneliness and longing had created. I saw the real him, the him that inspired me to leave and fight so many times, and overcame my hopelessness of surviving without him. And, unfortunately, that was a person I loved, and no amount of hate would fix it. So, instead, I chose to just go forward with love instead of hate.

Even down to simple things like \u201cwhat did you do today?\u201d I have to put the pieces of what he tells me together to figure out what he\u2019s done that day.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve been together for over three years, and in the course of three years there has been a multitude of girls that pop up on his phone, calling at random hours of the night. I have never gone through his phone but I can see the screen and yes I quickly read the messages. \n\nI\u2019m not a confrontational person, nor am I insecure or jealous, but mostly I\u2019m scared of the outcome of his rage, so I very rarely confront or even ask questions.  The rare times I do, he can explain it all away he\u2019ll even screenshot WhatsApp messages as proof, and my ego is so eager to believe him.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve found hairs all over his bed and shower.

I\u2019ve seen her name since last summer, saved under \u201cher name\u201d and the club he met her at.  \n\nSo last night we got into a bit of an argument, he called me selfish, and that\u2019s the one thing I hate, because between the both of us I\u2019m not the selfish one.  So the flood gates opened, and I told him all the things I\u2019ve observed, and he denies it all.  So I double down and ask for proof.

My nex broke up with me 4 months ago out of the blue. It was very much a cruel discard. We had been together for four years and there were definite red flags in the relationship that I didn\u2019t even notice till reflecting now (think Luke P from the bachelorette). We\u2019re young- I\u2019m 20, he\u2019s about to turn 21 and we go to the same college and are a part of the same tight knit campus ministry. The breakup was brutal. He completely discarded me out of the blue- said he hadn\u2019t loved me for a while, he had feelings for a bunch of other girls, etc. He even flat out said that he\u2019s been emotionally and physically using me for two years (and later denied it saying I took it out of context). It came at such a shock for me I just  wanted to know the why behind it all and how this could have happened so out of the blue. I didn\u2019t really recognize the narcissistic tendencies until he tried to get with one of my friends a week after breaking up with me and it didn\u2019t work out for him and made him look like a fool. He became so emotionally and verbally abusive in the weeks following that and my naive self didn\u2019t go no contact. He screamed at me, cursed at me, insulted me, tried to make the entire breakup my fault. When I would finally be having a good day, he\u2019d reach out and try to drag me back down and his reasoning was, \u201cWhenever you feel okay, I feel awful and terrible. But whenever you\u2019re angry or sad, I feel good\u201d. So yeah it\u2019s been a long four months of him going back and forth along with other narcissistic red flags that I\u2019m now just picking up on thanks to my therapist. We finally got to one month of no contact after I blocked him on literally everything and anything.\n\nSo now for my question and what I need advice on, should I go back to the campus ministry when college starts? He\u2019s there all. the. time. That\u2019s most likely where he will get his new supply to stroke his ego. All his friends are there and I already know he started a smear campaign. If I continue to go there, I will be around him because he\u2019s there trying to put on a face that he\u2019s this good Christian guy.

Now they need to feel the dopamine, they obtain it by hurting and destroying other people. They also get it from someone praising them. Deep inside they feel they deserve to be more important than others.\n\n\\-Why does the cat play with food (the mouse)? Because that's what a predator does. A narcissist is a human predator, they like playing with people, this brings the dopamine to them. They're biologically wired to behave in that way. NPD individuals are human predators, they play with their prey even if they don't want to eat it.\n\n\\-Normal human beings are mice to predatory personalities, we don't have the capacity to even fight them, no matter how tough normal people are they can't compete with a predator, emotions (which the narcissist lacks) get in the way when trying to misbehave.\n\n\\-A common outcome of narcissistic abuse is suicide because most victims feel completely violated, you'll never get closure from them, they move on like nothing happened, they don't have emotions... but they can fake emotions, they stare at their newborns trying to feel love, trying to look normal. When the narcissist is alone and no one is watching they don't react to anything.\n\n\\-The predator doesn't need you, there's no connection with you, sex for a narcissist is like dropping the clothes and just jumping at it, there's no real love there, they can have it at a moment's notice. They do it because they see it as beneficial to get what they want from you but they don't especially like it, sometimes they will put on a performance just to look great though.\n\n\\-Narcissists get a rush of dopamine witnessing the destruction of other people, especially when they caused said destruction, they feel powerful. Female narcissists really enjoy breaking strong males, male narcissists look for the most innocent and caring women and leave them empty and isolated, they want to make you a recluse. The cat is very happy to be playing with the mouse.\n\n\\-During the discard phase they denigrate all things you enjoy, they go to any lengths to make you and all the things you love bad, they're ruthless. At this point they've probably separated you from everything that kept you sane. A narcissist knows they're going to discard everyone in their life, you're temporary, they know they're going to hurt you. It doesn't take very long after you become of no use to them. If they stay in a long term relationship it's because they're extracting valuable resources whilst looking normal.\n\n\\-Let me tell you again that they're human predators, they don't have emotions and they won't ever change, you can die today and tomorrow they wake up and they're exactly the same. In this sense, that you're here alive is reason enough to be grateful... so many people don't make it this far. Also, there's no way to be the person you once were, but you can still become your best version, the first step is knowing that it was never your fault.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

And then it turned bad with her wanting to control everything about my life, making everybody believe that all my Academic achievements where because of her( she works in my former university). Always belittling me and comparing me to her teen daughter, I am 25 by the way. Always guilt tripping me, making me feel like everything in life was always my fault and making me feel like I was a complete failure that can do anything right.

This comment pushed me over the edge, I immediately turned off the nice girl and shouted at him, how dare he think  *I* need to prove my love to him when I was good to him in our 6 years together and faithful, helping him when he needed help to be repaid back with constant disrespect, he was the one that constantly cheated, lied, decieved and triangulated. He's the one that brought multiple women to my inbox to expose his behaviour, yet *I'm* the one that needs to prove my love!? I still shed tears over his infidelity till this day.

Right now getting a job is super hard since my last job was horrid to me and I'm also juggling depression and transitioning, and now it's getting worse as she starts to see that I'm more liberal than most of my family so she always starts arguments with me in front of my parents in the dining table and leaves me speechless with yelling over me, calling me an idiot and asking me to make up solutions right away. It's been going on for so long now that my parents basically think it's just banter and it's far from. Sometimes I have to hide bruises because she takes her anger out on me.

When I was little, my mother fawned over me. She has about a million and a half home videos, professional photoshoots, bits of memorabilia, and etc. from when I was ages 0-5.  My parents were separated when I was seven years old and proceeded to spend most of that era of my childhood off doing their own things (mostly partying - my mother loved going to bars to drink and play pool, while my dad was in a very active band). It wasn't until I started showing an interest in boys at around age thirteen that my dad started being a more active parent.\n\nAnyway - in those six years, I remember always being late to school, because my dad would drag his feet taking us in the mornings - which lead to scoldings from my teachers even though I obviously had no power over this issue being a kid and all. Then, after school, it was my mom's job to pick us up and take us back to wherever we were staying, where we were usually alone for hours until an adult came home (if one did before we fell asleep). She owned a store in town and if she was alone, she was supposed to close the store for 30 minutes to come get us. However, that didn't work out for very long. She stopped being diligent pretty quickly, and a lot of times that meant we were sitting out in front of the school until at least sunset, waiting for her to come get us. Sometimes the office expressed concern, but, like my teachers, they always made me feel like it was my fault that somehow I hadn't made sure my parents would be responsible for us. It was humiliating. I already felt unwanted by my mother and father, and pretty much every other adult in my life, and then I had to deal with the fall out of how it upset other adults.\n\nThen one day, I called my uncle (who was abusive in a different way) from the office and he came to pick us up. We went to my mother's store to see what was going on, and when I walked in, she was sitting with two of her friends, chatting away. Even after catching her slacking, shit stayed the same. We eventually started going to daycare after school, but that was very brief, then my dad had me start walking home.\n\nThat actually worked out great for my sister and I (she was along with me for almost all of this). It helped us become independent and built trust between us and my father. While he was still largely absent, our relationship with him began to improve.\n\nUnfortunately, junior high came - which meant I was transferring to a school *way* further away (I had never even been there until I went to orientation), and meant I would have to worry about getting rides from my mother again. I was twelve. On the FIRST DAMN DAY, she didn't show up to come get me after school. I had a dinky cell phone that my dad had bought me for emergencies and had no luck reaching anyone, including my mother. It was raining, I didn't know anyone, and I didn't know how to get home. After over an hour I decided to try to walk home. I almost got hit by a car as I tried to run across the street, and then I got lost.\n\nAfter wandering around a bunch, sobbing hysterically, I got my bearings and made my way back to the school. I still didn't know what to do, so I sat and waited for what felt like forever. I had sent my mom several angry and confused texts before that trying to figure out what was going on, to no avail. Finally, a response; she was coming to get me, and I should be \"fucking grateful and have more respect.\"\n\nShe showed up shortly after and we got into a shouting match on the way home - her complaining to me about how inconvenient it was for her to have to come get me, and other general complaints about being a mom. As soon as I recognized where we were (it was actually fairly quickly - I had set off in the wrong direction before), I told her to pull over and I jumped out of the car. I had been wearing a sweater she lent me, and I took it off and threw it at her. Then she sped off, and I walked home.\n\nAfter that short drive of figuring out how I set out the wrong way, I never relied on a ride home again.\n\nWe sort of repaired our relationship during highschool, where she let me talk openly about sex and bought me alcohol. She became a much more attentive mother the more independent I became, and I think that's because I was becoming more like a friend and less like a daughter.\n\nToday my relationship with her is strained, but she doesn't seem to realize that. I think she thinks we get along great, even though we don't see each other very often.\n\nAaaand that's the end of my rant.  \nI do feel a lot better.  \nThank you to anyone who made it through :)", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

We (unfortunately) met on tinder. I know I shouldn\u2019t have sought out a relationship on that platform but I was lonely and desperate. And everything was great. He was handsome, charismatic and funny and I didn\u2019t see the warning signs. I was too infatuated. \n\nI met his family in March. His father was friendly enough and I didn\u2019t sense anything off then. But his mother. I got red flashing lights the moment I met her. \n\nIt took me a while to really catch on, but the first time I met her I just figured she had the worst case of unmedicated anxiety I\u2019ve ever seen in someone. She worried about the littlest things. She said things or worded things in ways that made me feel uncomfortable. I brushed it off. After all, I didn\u2019t know her past or what had happened and didn\u2019t want to ask. We were just getting to know each other. \n\nAnd then I learned that my boyfriend was a wanted felon. His parents denied the charges my boyfriend was accused of, along with my boyfriend. I was shown the evidence the court had against him. It seemed that the court had it all wrong. They got the wrong guy, and if it was the right guy, there wasn\u2019t enough evidence against him to properly convict. After all, how many blue trailblazers do you see driving down the road?  And how can someone\u2019s word stating that my boyfriend was in that car late at night in a poorly lit parking lot?  It made sense. So I supported him in trying to fight the case, but he took a plea for a lesser sentence. He went to jail on January 9th of 2018. \n\nI was still so madly in love with him.\n\nThen I found texts on his phone. Texts from escorts. He was sending naked pictures to them. He was buying drugs from them. And my world came crashing down around me. I felt so betrayed. And he was going to call me the moment I had a google voice app set up on my phone.\n\nHis father said what he was doing was not considered cheating as he had never physically met the escorts. And no matter how many times and different ways I tried to explain that it was cheating as those pictures he sent and those cute little pet names he was calling those escorts should only be meant for his significant other; me. This was another red flag. \n\nTwo days later he called. I read off the names I took down of the escorts. Read some of the messages. He denied and hung up. I felt alone. And so hurt that he would do something like this to me let alone not explain things to me. \n\nThen he called back. He explained himself. Apologized and said he wouldn\u2019t do it again. He was crying. I was stupid and forgave him. I visited him once a month while he was in jail, as he was 5 hours away from me. And everything was great. \n\nHis family and I had a few other hiccups along the way but nothing that really got me to step back and say \u201cthis isn\u2019t healthy for me anymore and I need to get out\u201d. \n\nHe got out September 14th of 2018. His birthday was September 30th. I planned a vacation to Disney world in the hopes that it would give him some good memories after he got out. And we had a blast. Everything was fine. He got a job and he was loving and we were happy. \n\nThen New Year\u2019s Eve happened. We were at one of my friends houses enjoying a party. We had both gotten a bit too drunk.  I heard what I thought was a syringe drop on the bathroom floor upon getting home from the party. I asked him about it. He got defensive and angry. He threatened me. He tried to provoke me to hit him. I locked him out but instantly felt guilty and was afraid he\u2019d break the glass. So I let him back in and started packing his things. He threatened me again for touching his stuff. Then wouldn\u2019t let me leave for a safe place so I had to walk. His parents came down to help him pack. \n\nThen they talked me out of breaking up with him. \n\nI still loved him too much. But I was definitely more alert to the warning signs. \n\nHis mother was still horrible. This is when I first noticed something off about her. She said I overreacted in that situation. And I couldn\u2019t blame her. I had been drinking. But I felt pretty damn sober by the time my boyfriend and I started fighting. \n\nBut once we got back together things were fine again. For a while. But I still kept an eye on his behavior. And I knew things were off after a while. He was drifting off at the dinner table or in the middle of watching a show. I blamed it on his line of business as he works construction and was pulling 6 day work weeks.  But I still inspected his usual hiding spots for drugs. And I found some small things but no concrete evidence. \n\nThen in March I got a call from his boss. He had tossed my boyfriend off the worksite for catching him shooting up on the job.  I rushed out there to meet up with my boyfriend. Told him to be honest with me and he said his boss was all the way across the job site watching him through a small second story window and couldn\u2019t possibly see him do anything. And I wasn\u2019t there so how could I judge. But I still knew something was off. He was still not being truthful. So we were going through the whole packing ordeal again. I got his parents to come down to collect their son and his things. He finally came clean. And promised he\u2019d check himself into rehab. And he did. He was in inpatient for 5 days and then did outpatient for months and is still continuing counseling today. \n\nI took him back. And things were okay again. I still loved him dearly. \n\nAnd then the last few weeks I started noticing the signs again. Signs that he wasn\u2019t being completely honest with me and hiding things. Even when I gave him the opportunities to be honest with absolutely no consequences. And he lied. \n\nI found messages on his phone on the 29th of June from escorts, trying to buy drugs and being flirty. And then I found pills that were not prescribed to him stashed away in the back pocket of his phone case.  And instead of discussing it with me, he left. That\u2019s when I chose freedom over excuses and blame. \n\nJune 30th rolled around. I had pawned the ring he had given me for Christmas in 2018. It was one of the only gifts he had gotten for me.  I had asked him to come by the house so we could talk. And he eventually did stop by. He didn\u2019t give me a chance to talk to him when he said he relapsed and tried to od on the drugs he had bought last night, because he knew he was losing me. And before I could get over that shock and get a word out, he popped a full bottle of sleeping pills in his mouth and walked away. \n\nI called 911.  He got angry with me and spit out the pills. Said it was a joke and he didn\u2019t know why I was taking him seriously. He had been talking about suicide all day to me via text.  So of course I was going to take this seriously. \n\nHe made more threats against me. Then fled before the cops arrived. But they caught up to him. Pulled him over and denied that he was a danger to himself and he never popped those pills. His father called. Asked me why his son had gotten pulled over. I explained the situation and he replied \u201cyou should have called me instead!\u201d  \n\nRed flag number three. \n\nRed flag number four came that same night in the form of his mother\u2019s fury, as I did not feel safe having her son in my house until he calmed down.  She blamed me for her son being on the street that night with nowhere to stay. She blamed me for her son losing his jobs even though I expressed to her that every one of his bosses had reached out to me about his behavior or what they caught him doing on the job.  It was still my fault because I should not have told them anything. \n\nThen she called me a liar. I asked what I was lying about, and she had stated that I said her son never gave me money for bills the night before. I apologized and stated I had probably misspoke myself as I was upset about my findings and anxious about confronting him. I then clarified the amount he gave me for the month of June was not enough to cover his half of the bills for the month and not only that, he had asked me for money that month and claimed he misplaced a portion of that money.  So I gave him more. I expressed to her me misspeaking myself does not account for her sons lies and the stuff he\u2019s hiding. She didn\u2019t care. \n\nThen she accused me of flirting with her sons previous boss and that\u2019s what got him fired. She got her son on board with that idea even though i have receipts showing that I had messaged his boss on Facebook no more than five times prior to the incident in March and it was all strictly professional. If his boss took that any other way than that, he is mistaken, and again clearly stated the incident that got their son fired. \n\nBut I\u2019m the evil one. I am the bitch for putting their son through this. \n\nAnd when they came down to help him pack, they figured they could try and talk us into getting back together.  That was their sole intention of this trip. They did not expect me to be serious. And now they\u2019re so shocked and stunned that I\u2019m forcing their son out of my house.\n\nSunday I will be free. Completely free from that toxicity, but I don\u2019t know how to heal.

But I guess it didn't go exactly to plan so I had a bit of extra skin and I'm not my sure why but my parents took me to the doctor about it, maybe it had been giving me problems idk, I tend to think it was my mom being a control freak? But at the doctor they prescribed me a medicine that I needed to to be applied to the skin but also when they applied the medicine my parents held me down and kindof pulled stretched the tiny flap of extra skin that went all the way around the head of my penis. Like I don't think they would have done it if the doctor didn't tell them too. But it hurt so bad and I cried every time they did it and begged them not to. I can't imagine doing what they did to me to my kid someday. I think I was around 6-9 years old, I'm not sure, it went on for a long time, maybe a couple years, and the medicine never changed anything. \n\nI don't even think it was medical, I think it was all cosmetic motivation in their part unless there is something they're leaving out. Plenty of penises are uncircumcised. \n\n\nIt makes me question a lot of things. I'm trans and sometimes I feel like this invalidates my identity bc of course I would hate my body if I was abused. Or what if I was born intersex and that \"circumcision\" was actually grs.

Don't get me wrong he did abuse me but most was towards my mom which I witnessed a lot of. Then my mother met my stepdad, they dated for years before getting married. He was ok at first then he would start to be very mean to me and my siblings. Grounding us and forcing us to stay in our rooms all day and only let us out to eat. After a while tho he started to favor my older brother, funny enough because they both liked playing cod. He tried to get me to play but I was no good as I was two years younger than my brother and was no good at the game which he hated and would yell at me for. He would ground me for something small and would keep me grounded for years. I was too young to hit but I would see him fight with my mom and he'd hit her and cheat on her and constantly put her down and once I took up for her and he pinned my against a wall by my neck and didn't let go till I passed out. There are to many to name but that's one that stands out. From the time of 7 to 12 I basically lived in my room. No tv or toys I wasn't allowed off my bed. I read every book I could get my hands on which kinda backfired cause now I don't like reading. He would put me down for talking a lot and for showing interest in stuff so I just started to stop talking or having to much emotion as to not bother him. He finally left when I was 13 and from then on I didn't talk about my emotions or really have any. My mom was so broken she wasn't much help. I kept them all inside and discovered drugs (mostly weed) halfway through high school to cope. About 3 weeks ago I had a mental breakdown and now I have uncontrollable emotions that I don't know how to deal with. I ended my drug use right after but now I'm having uncontrollable flashbacks and thought about him and my dad.

Not for all of the roses in the world. \n\nHe (m41) lives 1000 miles away from me (f45). We met in an online app while he was traveling for work. I had intended to go on one casual and  fun date with him and let him leave town. I ended up getting love-bombed for the next 2 months while he worked in town. We began dating long distance and traveled extensively for his work. I thought we were bonding over travel. That I had finally met the one man who was my match. 2 months into dating he told me he had been living with a girl previous to meeting me. That night he was moving out of her house because he realized he loved me. I was thrilled to be chosen and forgave the whole thing. I was upset about being made into \u201cthe other woman\u201d against my knowledge. I told him I wanted his focus and monogamy if it was going to work. He seemed to agree. \n\nIt was a dramatic and tumultuous relationship which included 3 close calls with him where I could have been killed. Police were involved once. Coerced me into talking about to the DA and defending him. They dropped the charges. He kept reeling me back in. Giving me hope. Talking about the future. Marriage. Loyalty. All of it was always revealed as lies. He kept going back to the woman he was living with when he met me. He also cheated with at least 5 other women. The last time I discovered it, he begged me to give him 3 months to prove himself and for us to fix it. \n\nI tried SO hard to fix him. To make him be loyal. To help him to tell the truth. It never worked. I tried everything. The last couple times we saw each other I kept the peace by fading into the background as much as possible. Only breaking that occasionally to tell him how amazing he was and be complimentary. In other words I acted perfectly who he wanted me to be. He was happy and I thought I was happy too. We spent a few amazing days full of kisses and laughter. I thought this could work. \n\nIn April, he went back home to work locally. He would call me while he was driving. Consuming my days with endless conversation. He would get angry randomly and hang up on me (hanging up on me was a behavior that started from the very first time we were far apart). For the first time in our almost 2 year relationship, he showed zero interest in me joining him and hitting the road. I felt in the pit of my stomach that he had cheated again. \n\nI decided that I could no longer live with not knowing. I didn\u2019t even care if he was cheating or not. But the fact that I would never know if he was, highlighted the fact that I didn\u2019t know HIM at all. I didn\u2019t. Know him. At. All. \n\nSo. It\u2019s been 55 days of hardcore no contact. It\u2019s been tough but I needed to never look back. \n\nAbout a week ago he started contacting me from various phones and email addresses. I blocked it all. No response from me. \n\nToday he showed up at my parents house. Which is 3.5 hours drive from where I live. (Remember: He lives 1000 miles from me.)  I have no idea how he knew I was there I told him \u201cNo. Go away.\u201d I barely had to think about it. I just blurted it and shut the door. He left with no drama thank goodness. He left a couple dozen roses and a card and a sloth plush (for my son, I assume). \n\nHe emailed me. Yet another new email address. He\u2019s sorry. He realizes that he was scared. He wrote: \u201cI hope you truly give me a chance to show you the lifetime you wanted us to have together.  I'm here to stay. I dont want to leave. I came cause my heart told me to.\u201d And \u201cI know I've done and said hurtful things but that wasnt me. I never felt I deserved anyone and I do deserve someone and that's you...\u201d etc etc. \n\nJust got home from parents and rose in my mailbox. He was here at some point too. \n\nHe\u2019s Love bombing me. Saying what may be or seem like all the right things. Making the grand gesture of flying across the country. \n\nI will always love him. I know I can\u2019t be with him. I need help to be brave. I need to be told to stay away and not run to him for a hug, kisses. I need to be told not to believe him that this is all common scripted language. \n\nI hope any of this makes sense. Going back to feeling the gaslighting fog.

I learned that he was arrested and sent for domestic violence including contributing to the death of a child. I am scared for her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year, I decided to reach out to an ex-girlfriend of mine and ask for forgiveness for my contribution to our break up. I no longer had hard feelings towards her or why we broke up. It was mutual, and I made a new years resolution to make amends to people who I had hurt in the past.\n\nShe was initially skeptical when I reached out, but after a couple of days of texting, we were able to be civil. However, the next day I got a multi-expletive angry rant from her husband threatening me that if I ever hurt her emotionally or made her upset he would come after me. This scared me, and I tried to apologize. I told him that my only intentions were to apologize for my past mistakes. I was happy that she had found someone and was happily married. I told him that I was also in a happy relationship. My only agenda was to make peace. however, he would not stop sending me angrier and more violent texts. He was insanely jealous, and his language got possessive. He told me that \"she's mine now. You fucked up and lost her. You lost. I won.\" This is worrisome to me, because she is not his property. She only belongs to herself. This sort of language is common to domestic abusers.\n\nI live in Pittsburgh. My ex and her husband live in Philadelphia. She and I have met for lunch twice since that initial texting conversation. I told her about the threats from her husband, and she tried to excuse it. I need to clarify that my ex and I are on fairly good terms now. We openly talk about her partners, in-laws, and plans for the future. She told me that she believes that my efforts to make amends are genuine.\n\nFinally, my curiosity got the better of me. My ex kept dropping hints that worried me. She told me that the reason why he was 10 years older than she was because he had a \"lost decade.\" She then let it slip that something terrible happened in his 20's and that it resulted in the death of his baby and his first wife divorcing him. finally, she told me that he could not go back to college because of his \"past actions.\" Taken together, this made of suspect that he might have a criminal past.\n\nI paid to do a criminal background check on my ex's husband. I found out that he had been arrested, convicted, and imprisoned for the following felonies: domestic abuse and assault; criminal neglect contributing to the death of a child; sexual battery contributing to the death of a child; assault and battery contributing to the death of a child.\n\nI have no idea how much of this she knows if any. One of the reasons she and I broke up was because she grew up very sheltered; she was homeschooled and grew up in a small rural community. therefore, she lacks \"street smarts\" and tends to be naive and lack a healthy skepticism. She tends to be overly trusting which has led to her getting involved with abusers before she and I dated. She also lacks self-esteem and self-confidence. She has told me that she doesn't think she can do better than him.\n\nI am very worried about her, but I don't know or if I can warn her without endangering her or myself. He knows where I live, and he is a convicted violent felon who has already threatened me. I don't want her back.

I\u2019ve told some people bits and pieces, but don\u2019t go into too much detail because I\u2019m convinced that no one would ever actually believe this stuff to be true.\n\nI'm feeling extremely lost lately and I feel like I'm on the brink of my life falling apart around me. Recently got into an argument with my sister about me not being willing to get back in touch with my mother, who I've not had any contact with since 2008. I'm feeling a bit guilty for my unwillingness to budge, and my little sister has basically given me an ultimatum to make up with my mother, or she might break off contact herself.\n\nI was put into foster care when I was 6, went through one foster home with my older sibling, and then was put in the same foster home as two of my younger siblings. I was in that second home for a year. They were a nice, conservative couple in their late forties with a decent size house in the country. They had been fostering children for years. Their youngest son was in his late teens and was living with them, along with a baby and a friend of their son\u2019s who they had taken in for a bit because of a bad situation at home. Needless to say, the house was full and we were sharing rooms, but I was happy because I was with three of my siblings. \n\nI had three other siblings, but they were adopted by their grandparents and we couldn\u2019t really see them anymore. \n\nA year later they adopted me, my three siblings, and the baby. This was in 1997. We were being taken to therapy before and after the adoption. The therapy sessions started getting more and more frequent, with the sessions running longer as we the therapist was helping us remember things, horrible things. My new mother went into a panic, even changing the first names of us kids a year after we were adopted. She wanted biblical names for most of us. We continued seeing the therapist, and she took in a few adults that were like us, like a safe house.\n\nThe memories they were helping us were getting more and more severe. She pulled us out of public school so we could focus more on our healing. She was doing therapy sessions at home herself, researching stuff herself. With her help, and the help of our therapist I started remembering more and more memories, each one more horrible than the last. Torture, sacrificing puppies, sexual abuse. I had multiple personalities, and a lot of them, hundreds even. They were organized in my mind it seemed, in a system, that didn\u2019t look too unlike a ziggurat. Hundreds of levels, each one with its own continent or cities. \n\nWe were working through tons of programming in my mind, some of the different programs based on something in pop culture, or on a facet of the occult. I liked Barbies and other dolls growing up, so I had Barbie programming, among many others. I guess this was one of the toughest ones to break. In fear of having me triggered, I had to look away from most commercials that would play on the TV. I got lots of Hot Wheels, which was great, but I played with them too much so I had to have them taken away in case I had programming for that, too. Mom would get really mad if we were caught doing something that had to do with our programming, she broke a few wooden spoons disciplining me because of it, and normal kid stuff, too.\n\nIn 1998 we started going to a new church. It was closer to home and had some people into spiritual warfare. My mother became really good friends with a few of them, and we would go over to their houses for playdates with the other kids. She became really close with one woman in particular, I\u2019ll call her Eliza, who showed great interest in us kids and helping us through the healing and deprogramming process. Us kids called her aunt and we had lots of fun when she watched us or took us for the day. She moved next door about a year later and we started having school at her house instead of at home. We would go over there a lot just to play, too. \n\nI had surgery in 1999 to have scar tissue removed from my urethra, it all went fine but I had to go for checkups for the first year or so. \n\nBy 2000 the therapy was done completely at home now, with a therapist out of state helping over the phone. Mom and sometimes aunt Eliza would regularly go to seminars and church event, gathering more and more resources to help us kids with our deprogramming. Aunt Eliza was gathering more and more contacts and intel, and she discovered that our dad was one of the bad guys. He abused us long before we were even adopted. Mom and dad had been married for thirty years and she was so ashamed that she had never noticed this until now, but everything started making sense. \n\nThere were some cops that were in our tiny town, observing all the cult activity, and aunt Eliza would go and speak with them every night, getting more and more intel. Us kids weren\u2019t allowed outside anymore without supervision, because there were bad people watching us, too. Aunt Eliza found out that some family friends were also involved in the cult, and we weren\u2019t allowed to see them anymore. At one point mom and aunt Eliza wanted DNA tests done, and with the tests they found out that all of us kids were not related. And the cops that aunt Eliza was talking to found out that our birthdays and ages were different, too. I was a year older, and my birthday was earlier! My two younger siblings weren\u2019t actually twins!\n\nI was told that I had a stroke when I was 4, and that was why I had been in physical and speech therapy for so long. It explained why I walked and moved weird.\n\nIn the summer of 2000 us kids were told by mom and aunt Eliza that our three sisters had run away from their grandparents and the two older ones were hiding in the corn fields around our little farm. But they were too afraid to come out. So they were drawing pictures and writing letters. And I would write them back. We were putting food out by the corn field as well, to make sure they could eat. I helped cook my favorite cookies to put out for them. I was getting letters from the younger of the two, the one I was closest with before we were separated, and she remembered how much I hugged her and that she missed me. We were not allowed to go into the corn field. But we would sit out on the grass by it and talk and talk and talk, hoping to coax them out. \n\nWe were told that the youngest of our three sisters was found and put in a hospital, but she disappeared while there and was assumed she was taken. But we were told that she was found a few weeks later in the basement of the hospital, curled up in a closet like she was hiding, dead. The two other girls stopped writing back and the food wasn\u2019t gone in the morning anymore. The cop friend\u2019s that aunt Eliza spoke with found their bodies in the woods about a mile away. \n\nIn 2001 the therapy was getting more intense, mom and aunt Eliza were going to more and more seminars. Bringing back more and more knowledge to help heal us kids. We started having therapy sessions in pairs or more, and the memories were getting worse and worse. My sister and I remembered being forced to kill a baby after we watched the bad guys rape it and rape us. After the ritual was seemingly done they gave us food, and we came to the realization that they had forced us to eat the baby. My sister and I wept, mom and aunt Eliza wept, we prayed went to bed. The next day I needed to start working on another memory, drawing it out like a mural on pieced of paper taped together. The castles in Chicago, the hidden floors where they tortured us in the skyscrapers of New Your City.\n\nEach memory corresponded with the splitting off of a specific personality. So for every personality there was a memory that I had to draw out, or write out as I got older. I had to live through each memory as we did our therapy sessions. I needed to cry, feel it, ask for forgiveness for the innocent babies and other children my abusers forced me to sacrifice. Over and over again. It was my homework, and we would have a therapy session once a week to go over all of the memories. \n\n2001 was the year that mom started taking in a lot of adult survivors, letting them stay with us. We had a converted school bus outside the house that they would stay in. Usually one at a time, but a few times we had multiple people staying with us. Aunt Eliza was living with us at this time as well. Her house had caught fire. She said it was the bad guys that did it. \n\nSome of the people that stayed with us came and went a few times. One of them snuck away. She pushed her car to the road in the middle of the night to slip away. Mom and aunt Eliza said she did it because she had to get away to go back to the cult. She never came back.\n\nIn fall 2001 my little sister and I went to Saint Louis to have a session with a therapist there. It lasted all day, and they did it to help me get through my Barbie and Titanic programming. But I was chastised by the therapist because I wasn\u2019t working hard enough on getting my memories out. Mom seemed embarrassed. \n\nSome time in 2002 aunt Eliza said she caught me torturing my sister\u2019s cat with a pair of scissors, though I don\u2019t remember doing it. For punishment I had to move out of the house and stay in the converted school bus with aunt Eliza. I could be in the house during the day, but I had to sleep in the bus. I didn\u2019t like it, it was scary being out there alone. I don\u2019t remember a ton, but I do remember aunt Eliza checking on me sometimes to make sure I was asleep. Sometimes if I wasn\u2019t she would hold me down while she masturbated me to help me fall asleep. Some nights she would take the cotton off of a cotton swab and but it into my urethra to make sure there wasn\u2019t any more scar tissue. \n\nI was allowed to move back into the house in early 2003, into the enclosed front porch. At this point they were really strict about making sure us kids were triggering different personalities in each other. We were never allowed to be alone with each other. If we were accused by aunt Eliza or mom of doing something we shouldn\u2019t have they shut us in our rooms. The first time for me it lasted for a week. I was only allowed to leave to go to the bathroom and to bathe. I had to take a shower with the door open and Aunt Eliza would sit in the bathroom or just outside of it to make sure I cleaned myself, and to make sure I didn\u2019t get into anything I wasn\u2019t supposed to. They eventually put chains on the cabinets so they needed to be unlocked to get into them. We used the bathroom cabinets as a pantry. \n\nThere were latches installed on the outside of our bedrooms, for padlocks just in case.\n\nOne morning I accidentally drank all my juice before I took my vitamins, so I took them with my cereal milk. Aunt Eliza said I was trying to trigger my sister. I was put in my room until I found out who inside was trying to trigger her. I wrote down more memories but they didn\u2019t think any of them was the person inside who did it. I was in my room for ten months. This happened off and on for a few years. Aunt Eliza wouldn\u2019t let me give mom a hug and kiss goodnight anymore because she said she was so disappointed in me. \n\nMy bedroom, the enclosed front porch, had an exterior door that they had put a desk in front of. Eventually I was big enough to move it myself, and I would and go outside late at night or early in the morning. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to run away though. I was caught one night because of the sound. A latch and padlock was added to that door as well. I would sneak out the window instead. At one point I had a plan to just run away down a nearby railroad track, but I could never go through with it. \n\nAt this point, mom and aunt Eliza had come to the conclusion that the bad guys had planned for mom to adopt us, and that there was a plan in place for mom, and they wanted to know why. They were convinced that we were there to kill mom for some reason. This did blow over and worked through it with us kids and they were pretty confident we weren\u2019t going to kill mom. I still wasn\u2019t allowed to give mom a hug, though. Very rarely would she hug me.\n\nBy the end of 2005 us kids were nearing the end of our deprogramming. Mom was doing a little seminar at a local church, and she wanted my older sister and I to speak. She was 19 and I was 16. We both put something together and spoke at the event about our healing and experiences with the occult and Satanic Ritual Abuse. But my older sister was accused of changing her part from what was agreed. She was shut in her room. But a few weeks later, just before Thanksgiving she went downstairs and told mom and aunt Eliza that she was leaving. They let her walk out.\n\nShe knocked on neighbor's doors and eventually one of them called the cops after letting her in. The cops came to the house with my sister but they didn\u2019t come in. In the morning my sister was gone. Us remaining kids were told she was taken to a mental institution. Aunt Eliza drove there to drop off some stuff, and to get our therapist from Saint Louis on the phone. She said my sister wouldn\u2019t talk, and that she was speaking in a demonic voice. A few weeks later we had a bonfire and burned all of my sister\u2019s journaling and photos. Prayed over them. We were told she was heading to Colorado to get reinitiated into the occult.\n\nWe started to go to that church my sister and I spoke at, and we became very close with a few people. They even came to our house and were told why there were latches on the bedroom doors. For our safety. Us kids were allowed to participate in the choir and drama at the church and it was glorious, but it only lasted about half a year. Mom and aunt Eliza were convinced the children\u2019s pastor was a member of the occult. We even had the pastor\u2019s adoptive daughter stay with us for a bit so they could help with therapy. But they were given an ultimatum to step down as church counselors or leave, because some people believed them to simply be slandering some of the leadership. We left the church. This was in 2006.\n\nLater that year they answered an ad in the paper looking for people to work at a tiny local organic farm. Us kids worked but we didn\u2019t really get the money, it went into the family\u2019s emergency funds. We befriended the owners of the farm, and were very involved in its operations. Aunt Eliza worked as a marketer for it and mom did the money management. The owners seemed to love us kids, and I worked a lot with the organic health and beauty stuff and teas. We even opened a tiny shop on the farm. But at home aunt Eliza was finding things that mom and her thought were being put there from dad to trigger us kids. Aunt Eliza even found a tore-up military uniform hanging from my bedroom ceiling one night. They had me stay at the organic farm with the couple because they wanted me to feel safe. \n\nEventually the relationship with the owners fell apart early the next year and we severed ties with them. I don\u2019t know what happened this time. \n\n2006 was the year that mom and aunt Eliza determined that I was deprogrammed, finally.\n\nMom was getting more and more afraid of dad and we started packing while he was at work. One day, we just left and moved to Tennessee while dad was at work. I was 18 at this point and as much as I\u2019d like to say it was all fine from there I can\u2019t. But it\u2019s almost 3AM and I\u2019m drained.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

This is breaking my partner's heart and I even wanted to break up with him just so things could return to their happy normal for him if my presence is so offensive. I hate the fact that any of this is happening and how happy they were before I came into the picture, but they also are causing us so much stress and self-doubt when we did nothing wrong.

I\u2019m just not sure how to tell if these changes are for real and lasting or if things will gradually slip and slide back to the (uncomfortable) status quo.  His changes seem sincere (in his words and some actions) but he still doesn\u2019t see how individual counseling will help him and says that if we don\u2019t get back together that his changes will have been for nothing.

Everything he says sounds sincere and real, but I don\u2019t feel ready to move back in and I don\u2019t trust my judgement with him.

I'm wondering if anyone else experienced anything similar.\n\nHe used to get really upset when I would praise/compliment or express a lot of love/support toward other people (not in obvious ways, or I would have noticed this earlier). It was almost as if expressing love or praise to anyone but him and his immediate family automatically devalued me in his eyes (and as though praise were a limited resource that I was wasting on other people). The \"expressing love/support\" thing applied to pretty much exclusively men (including the men in my family), but the praise thing applied to everybody and included friends of his own. \n\n**Some examples****:**\n\n* *Paraphrased Quote*: \"How am I supposed to take your praise seriously when you'll tell anybody that they're capable? You have no discretion when it comes to encouraging people.\"\n* When he was having a mental breakdown about his abilities and I was trying to encourage him by telling him he was the best writer I knew by leaps and bounds: \"That doesn't mean much considering the people you hang out with.\"\n* If I complimented, liked, or got along with one of his friends, he would criticize/devalue them mercilessly (to the extent that he called his best friend disgusting/slovenly and portrayed him as an aimless failure-- he isn't). If I *didn't* like them, he would defend them and tell me I was threatened by them (his explanation for why changed often and usually served an end goal of his).

They went from defended to devalued the moment I started to enjoy their company.\n* A friend of mine (male) was in a bad place, threatening suicide and various other forms of self-harm. I spent over an hour on the phone with him trying to calm him down, and at some point said something like, \"You have so many people that love you. I love you. My brother loves you.\" etc. My ex took issue both with the fact that I spent so much time on the phone with my friend, *and* with the fact that I said that I loved him.

She refuses to accept she's abusive and sees me as the only problem.", "author": "abusethrowaway9999", "self_text": "Throwaway because I don't know how much she's spying on me and I don't want her to find my regular account.\n\nEdit: I thought it would be important to mention I am nearly 30.\n\nSo first, I have severe hyperactive ADHD, schizoaffective unipolar depressive subtype, severe complex PTSD, and autism (formerly Asperger's) physically I have fibromyalgia, exercise induced asthma, hyperflexibility, back pain and insomnia. I do get frustrated very easily from communication issues and I get loud. I'm a naturally loud person. If you've seen jennamarbles I do the kind of yelling she does too.\n\nSo I can't afford to live on my own on disability and this area has no continuous jobs for my fiancee. (She does temp work and rarely is assigned) I've been trying to get out for years though. I believe my mom is very abusive. For background she's trans, so formerly my biological father and my biological mom is debatably worse but only a little. \n\nShe's losing her mind completely. She has various issues, PTSD, depression and borderline for the ones I know of. Years ago she would occasionally say to me and my fiance \"have I been acting weird the past (x long period of time)? Because I don't remember any of it\" this is relevant. Her memory is even worse now. She's recently in the past year developed a spine problem that causes her to fall at random. Ive been thinking and things worsened a lot after 2 events. She slipped in the bathtub and hit her head, and the inpatient psychiatrist took her off all her meds.\n\nSo she doesn't accommodate for my disability at all. If I do intense physical labor, not only does it hurt during it but I am bedridden for a day up to a week depending on how much work. One of the things I can't do is clean. We used to be responsible for our own sections of the house, but she had some medical person coming to check things out and her part of the house had to be cleaned. But she didnt lift a finger. I can understand that... But i was forced to spend 11 hours straight cleaning and additionally was not permitted to sleep for 36 hours starting about 12hr prior to me starting cleaning. This left me in bed for a week. I was held responsible for not cooking dinner and punished for it despite not being able to move much without extreme pain. On another occasion, a mere 2 weeks later when I had just recovered, she said you have 2 weeks to clean your old room so I can use it. Ok fine. I was gonna do a little at a time. 2 days later. A Sunday. That's important. My fiancee had accepted a temp job for Monday. We knew this. She does heavy factory labor usually. Very physical. She had been having back problems so she should rest up and soak in the bath and all, spend the day recovering so she could work well. Suddenly, knowing this about my fiancee, I was given 12 hours to clean that room entirely top to bottom or every single one of my belongings would be bagged up and put in the trash. It was a lot of work to clean and my fiancee finished it for me when I collapsed. This caused her to not get any of the rest she needed for work, and Tuesday she fell ill and was diagnosed with a back strain and told she was overworked. By a doctor. She was very ill for a week with a sinus infection as well and still has complications a month later. \n\nSo now, this past week she's had severe lung pain, so severe that on the way to the ER in an ambulance it overwhelmed her and she had pseudoseizures, which has never happened before. Through all of this, she and I have been forced to work.\n\nAfter the first cleaning incident my mother argued with me, now that's a daily thing BUT. She told me, that I wasn't disabled, just a lazy little shit, I didn't deserve disability even if I was disabled because I had never had a job (I did have one for a few months when I was 16) she knows x and y people each with, individually, autism or schizoaffective and they can work. I pointed out she is healthier than me(she has a master's in psychology and a wheelchair, that isn't too disabled to work and the VA has been trying to hire her) and she says she deserves her disability because she was in the military. Later she calls me a liar when I had quoted her words exactly and of course in disabled! She also said she could've helped a bit and she didn't help me because she wanted me to be punished. She denies that as well. Ever since, on and off she criticizes me for being disabled my whole life.\n\nIf you request she stop doing something she will do it anyway after saying she knows you don't want her to. She prides herself on randomly verbally assaulting random strangers or people she knows and likes to tell me all about it every day she comes home. This does happen daily. I confirmed with my fiancee, the days she didn't rant to me she ranted to my fiancee.  I told her I didn't want to hear it anymore because it was upsetting. Next day she comes home, traps me in the kitchen while I'm cooking and literally begins with \"I know you don't want me to tell you BUT\" (proceeds to knowingly acrively ruin my day)\n\nRecently shes been getting more and more fucked up with her attacks, and the final straw last night. We had been arguing about the 4th of July. As I said, my fiancee is very very ill and was at the peak, unfortunately, on the 4th. I in advance bought some nice food to cook, and quite a variety. I require assistance to cook like that. I require assistance to cook anything less than frozen, canned or boxed. She got very upset that day. Anyway after that fight, I told her I'd make it the next day. She ended up hospitalized overnight and didn't get home till 4 pm. While in the hospital she said not to make it. She got home and I asked, do you want me to make the food, I am well enough. \n\nThis is important. She declined. She said no. She clearly turned down my request.\n\nWe made her the food today. She was mad because I told her I'd make her another dish IN THE EVENING if she was hungry. Sure I wasn't clear that she had to ask me but I thought that was obvious. At 9 she started a fight about it and it got out of hand. she says that I should have made it at 4... We had dinner at 5. Whatever. I was PHYSICALLY OUT OF THE HOUSE  from 6 to 8. At 9 I'm waiting and this happens. She then says 8 is too late blah blah. Then I asked what she defined evening as. 4 -6 are not evening. we agree evening is about 7 to 9. I think 10 but whatever close enough. She tried to make it relative to what I was doing. No evening is a time of day. She accepted my saying I'd make it in the evening and suddenly evening is too late. Then she starts screaming at me for making it Saturday instead of Thursday and says \"it could've been made friday but you didnt\" insults etc. I'm at that point trying to tell her she told me not to do it so I listened and what the fuck... This is the sort of situation I frequently get punished for. I'm screaming at that point because it's just the final straw. So she pulls out her phone and obnoxiously starts playing music to drown me out. I took it out of her hand and turned it off. She did not try to keep ahold of it. I did not have to and did not twist it. I pulled it up and out, the way with least resistance. She claims I broke her thumb. She would've broken 80000000 bones falling by now if I could've done that.  She is claiming that me merely taking her phone from her is domestic violence. There is no way I hurt her. No way. I also did not do it with any intent to hurt her. She threatened to break my jaw and I have to be out by August 30th. Then lectures me repeatedly about how I have to keep my temper 24/7 no matter what anyone ever does to me. While I apologize and pour out my feelings about how bad I feel. She keept attacking me until I left. That's not domestic violence is it? She refused to go to the hospital. She refused to wear a brace. How can she not be malingering?\n\nHave I mentioned I apologize constantly for everything I do wrong and she hasn't apologized even once. When my fiancee backs me up she claims my fiancee is lying so I dont get mad. Thats 9000% bullshit.\n\nHer therapists can be seriously concerned legitimately for her about me. When I say my psychiatrist is concerned about my health she starts screaming that I'm obviously exaggerating and lying to my psychiatrist, and she's only getting one side of the story, then demands to be in one of my appointments. It's not one sided when she says it? She never lets me talk to any of her healthcare. \n\nI am only suicidal in her presence, or when thinking about or talking about the way she treats me. I was talking to friends tonight about it and I didn't desperately want to kill myself for once. Why? Because I see for sure it will end. It helps that it's soon too!\n\nShe also will deny her problems in one occasion then admit to them when it's convenient or vice versa. For example. I once politely and with concern and care tried to tell her her memory is going to hell. She screamed denials at me etc. Then in another occasion she said the VA would never hire her because her memory is too bad... Because it backed her up in that situation.\n\nI have some severe autism symptoms. One is headbanging. If I lose consciousness from it, she will leave me on the floor and ignore me. My fiancee has come in to find me passed out and unwakable for a few minutes, with her still shouting horrible fucked up insults at me laying on the floor, potentially with a bleeding brain considering how long I was out. She has said this is because I'm obviously faking it for attention. I have never done such a thing even once. I had even recently had several concussions. Now every time I hear a loud noise that could be her falling I rush to her aid. From downstairs. With asthma and chronic pain. Additionally I was having a severe asthma attack once (I'll get too weak to operate my inhaler on my own) and she administered my inhaler wrong. Pointed it at my tongue and sprayed it at it, naturally the medication did nothing. When I yelled that she sprayed my tongue, she insulted me for having my tongue in the wrong spot, tossed the inhaler on the floor far from me and left me on the floor alone, while my fiancee was frozen with panic. Thankfully she gathered her senses before things went seriously wrong. \n\nAnd the last thing I'll add. She does not acknowledge when I do what she asks. She'll say I never ever make dinner even when I did the very last night, and a big one too. She used to yell at me for even getting assistance with any of my tasks.\n\nAm I the abusive one? Is she not abusive? She says she's a reasonable rational person. And says her mhps say I'm the only problem here.\n\nThere is something I intended to write that I've completely forgotten. Will edit and add if I recall it\n\nEdit: shell scream at me for not keeping a normal bedtime despite having unmedicated insomnia and also potentially some sort of sleep disorder regarding circadian rhythm\n\nEdit 2: about the spying thing. She's been eavesdropping on me and decided to scream at me for like an hour for discussing my home problems with my friends and telling them I believe it's unreasonable for her to expect me to do things I physically cannot, or can't without being bedridden for a week. I know she'd then punish me for not making dinner for a week.\n\nAlso, naturally she believes in her problems, just doesn't believe anyone else is short of physically fit.\n\nEdit: as far as the effect of the threats and random unexpected attacks on me, she frequently threatens homelessness, and I can't predict when she's going to verbally assault me next, so EVERY TIME she says wants to talk to me I start getting shaky and afraid she's going to randomly attack or evict me. I can't hear my phone go off without having an extreme upwelling of anxiety until I confirm its not her instigating again. So basically Instagram and Google photos and such give me a tiny heart attack with every notification. If I don't respond to something for long enough i will also get attacked. So I have to leave the volume up..\n\nShe confuses me though. Once I forgot to toss/store the cooked rice in the rice cooker for quite a while, I forgot it in there. It got extremely disgusting. I have a weak stomach. Since my other mom told me to stop being so dramatic when i was actively vomiting due to washing disgusting dishes (washing normal dirty dishes make me very nauseated) and also out of concerned for this mom's back pain and disability, I tried to clean it myself. I was loudly retching involuntarily but I almost got it done. I tried my absolute best but had to run to the toilet to be sick. She ended up washing it for me anyway. \n\nI don't understand? This is what makes me doubt it.

I do get frustrated very easily from communication issues and I get loud. I'm a naturally loud person. If you've seen jennamarbles I do the kind of yelling she does too.\n\nSo I can't afford to live on my own on disability and this area has no continuous jobs for my fiancee. (She does temp work and rarely is assigned) I've been trying to get out for years though. I believe my mom is very abusive. For background she's trans, so formerly my biological father and my biological mom is debatably worse but only a little. \n\nShe's losing her mind completely. She has various issues, PTSD, depression and borderline for the ones I know of. Years ago she would occasionally say to me and my fiance \"have I been acting weird the past (x long period of time)? Because I don't remember any of it\" this is relevant. Her memory is even worse now. She's recently in the past year developed a spine problem that causes her to fall at random. Ive been thinking and things worsened a lot after 2 events. She slipped in the bathtub and hit her head, and the inpatient psychiatrist took her off all her meds.\n\nSo she doesn't accommodate for my disability at all. If I do intense physical labor, not only does it hurt during it but I am bedridden for a day up to a week depending on how much work. One of the things I can't do is clean. We used to be responsible for our own sections of the house, but she had some medical person coming to check things out and her part of the house had to be cleaned. But she didnt lift a finger. I can understand that... But i was forced to spend 11 hours straight cleaning and additionally was not permitted to sleep for 36 hours starting about 12hr prior to me starting cleaning. This left me in bed for a week. I was held responsible for not cooking dinner and punished for it despite not being able to move much without extreme pain. On another occasion, a mere 2 weeks later when I had just recovered, she said you have 2 weeks to clean your old room so I can use it. Ok fine. I was gonna do a little at a time. 2 days later. A Sunday. That's important. My fiancee had accepted a temp job for Monday. We knew this. She does heavy factory labor usually. Very physical. She had been having back problems so she should rest up and soak in the bath and all, spend the day recovering so she could work well. Suddenly, knowing this about my fiancee, I was given 12 hours to clean that room entirely top to bottom or every single one of my belongings would be bagged up and put in the trash. It was a lot of work to clean and my fiancee finished it for me when I collapsed. This caused her to not get any of the rest she needed for work, and Tuesday she fell ill and was diagnosed with a back strain and told she was overworked. By a doctor. She was very ill for a week with a sinus infection as well and still has complications a month later. \n\nSo now, this past week she's had severe lung pain, so severe that on the way to the ER in an ambulance it overwhelmed her and she had pseudoseizures, which has never happened before. Through all of this, she and I have been forced to work.\n\nAfter the first cleaning incident my mother argued with me, now that's a daily thing BUT. She told me, that I wasn't disabled, just a lazy little shit, I didn't deserve disability even if I was disabled because I had never had a job (I did have one for a few months when I was 16) she knows x and y people each with, individually, autism or schizoaffective and they can work. I pointed out she is healthier than me(she has a master's in psychology and a wheelchair, that isn't too disabled to work and the VA has been trying to hire her) and she says she deserves her disability because she was in the military. Later she calls me a liar when I had quoted her words exactly and of course in disabled! She also said she could've helped a bit and she didn't help me because she wanted me to be punished. She denies that as well. Ever since, on and off she criticizes me for being disabled my whole life.\n\nIf you request she stop doing something she will do it anyway after saying she knows you don't want her to. She prides herself on randomly verbally assaulting random strangers or people she knows and likes to tell me all about it every day she comes home. This does happen daily. I confirmed with my fiancee, the days she didn't rant to me she ranted to my fiancee.  I told her I didn't want to hear it anymore because it was upsetting. Next day she comes home, traps me in the kitchen while I'm cooking and literally begins with \"I know you don't want me to tell you BUT\" (proceeds to knowingly acrively ruin my day)\n\nRecently shes been getting more and more fucked up with her attacks, and the final straw last night. We had been arguing about the 4th of July. As I said, my fiancee is very very ill and was at the peak, unfortunately, on the 4th. I in advance bought some nice food to cook, and quite a variety. I require assistance to cook like that. I require assistance to cook anything less than frozen, canned or boxed. She got very upset that day. Anyway after that fight, I told her I'd make it the next day. She ended up hospitalized overnight and didn't get home till 4 pm. While in the hospital she said not to make it. She got home and I asked, do you want me to make the food, I am well enough. \n\nThis is important. She declined. She said no. She clearly turned down my request.\n\nWe made her the food today. She was mad because I told her I'd make her another dish IN THE EVENING if she was hungry. Sure I wasn't clear that she had to ask me but I thought that was obvious. At 9 she started a fight about it and it got out of hand. she says that I should have made it at 4... We had dinner at 5. Whatever. I was PHYSICALLY OUT OF THE HOUSE  from 6 to 8. At 9 I'm waiting and this happens. She then says 8 is too late blah blah. Then I asked what she defined evening as. 4 -6 are not evening. we agree evening is about 7 to 9. I think 10 but whatever close enough. She tried to make it relative to what I was doing. No evening is a time of day. She accepted my saying I'd make it in the evening and suddenly evening is too late. Then she starts screaming at me for making it Saturday instead of Thursday and says \"it could've been made friday but you didnt\" insults etc. I'm at that point trying to tell her she told me not to do it so I listened and what the fuck... This is the sort of situation I frequently get punished for. I'm screaming at that point because it's just the final straw. So she pulls out her phone and obnoxiously starts playing music to drown me out. I took it out of her hand and turned it off. She did not try to keep ahold of it. I did not have to and did not twist it. I pulled it up and out, the way with least resistance. She claims I broke her thumb. She would've broken 80000000 bones falling by now if I could've done that.  She is claiming that me merely taking her phone from her is domestic violence. There is no way I hurt her. No way. I also did not do it with any intent to hurt her. She threatened to break my jaw and I have to be out by August 30th. Then lectures me repeatedly about how I have to keep my temper 24/7 no matter what anyone ever does to me. While I apologize and pour out my feelings about how bad I feel. She keept attacking me until I left. That's not domestic violence is it? She refused to go to the hospital. She refused to wear a brace. How can she not be malingering?\n\nHave I mentioned I apologize constantly for everything I do wrong and she hasn't apologized even once. When my fiancee backs me up she claims my fiancee is lying so I dont get mad. Thats 9000% bullshit.\n\nHer therapists can be seriously concerned legitimately for her about me. When I say my psychiatrist is concerned about my health she starts screaming that I'm obviously exaggerating and lying to my psychiatrist, and she's only getting one side of the story, then demands to be in one of my appointments. It's not one sided when she says it? She never lets me talk to any of her healthcare. \n\nI am only suicidal in her presence, or when thinking about or talking about the way she treats me. I was talking to friends tonight about it and I didn't desperately want to kill myself for once. Why? Because I see for sure it will end. It helps that it's soon too!\n\nShe also will deny her problems in one occasion then admit to them when it's convenient or vice versa. For example. I once politely and with concern and care tried to tell her her memory is going to hell. She screamed denials at me etc. Then in another occasion she said the VA would never hire her because her memory is too bad... Because it backed her up in that situation.\n\nI have some severe autism symptoms. One is headbanging. If I lose consciousness from it, she will leave me on the floor and ignore me. My fiancee has come in to find me passed out and unwakable for a few minutes, with her still shouting horrible fucked up insults at me laying on the floor, potentially with a bleeding brain considering how long I was out. She has said this is because I'm obviously faking it for attention. I have never done such a thing even once. I had even recently had several concussions. Now every time I hear a loud noise that could be her falling I rush to her aid. From downstairs. With asthma and chronic pain. Additionally I was having a severe asthma attack once (I'll get too weak to operate my inhaler on my own) and she administered my inhaler wrong. Pointed it at my tongue and sprayed it at it, naturally the medication did nothing. When I yelled that she sprayed my tongue, she insulted me for having my tongue in the wrong spot, tossed the inhaler on the floor far from me and left me on the floor alone, while my fiancee was frozen with panic. Thankfully she gathered her senses before things went seriously wrong. \n\nAnd the last thing I'll add. She does not acknowledge when I do what she asks. She'll say I never ever make dinner even when I did the very last night, and a big one too. She used to yell at me for even getting assistance with any of my tasks.\n\nAm I the abusive one? Is she not abusive? She says she's a reasonable rational person. And says her mhps say I'm the only problem here.\n\nshell scream at me for not keeping a normal bedtime despite having unmedicated insomnia and also potentially some sort of sleep disorder regarding circadian rhythm\n\nabout the spying thing. She's been eavesdropping on me and decided to scream at me for like an hour for discussing my home problems with my friends and telling them I believe it's unreasonable for her to expect me to do things I physically cannot, or can't without being bedridden for a week. I know she'd then punish me for not making dinner for a week.\n\nAlso, naturally she believes in her problems, just doesn't believe anyone else is short of physically fit.\n\nas far as the effect of the threats and random unexpected attacks on me, she frequently threatens homelessness, and I can't predict when she's going to verbally assault me next, so EVERY TIME she says wants to talk to me I start getting shaky and afraid she's going to randomly attack or evict me. I can't hear my phone go off without having an extreme upwelling of anxiety until I confirm its not her instigating again. So basically Instagram and Google photos and such give me a tiny heart attack with every notification. If I don't respond to something for long enough i will also get attacked. So I have to leave the volume up..\n\nShe confuses me though. Once I forgot to toss/store the cooked rice in the rice cooker for quite a while, I forgot it in there. It got extremely disgusting. I have a weak stomach. Since my other mom told me to stop being so dramatic when i was actively vomiting due to washing disgusting dishes (washing normal dirty dishes make me very nauseated) and also out of concerned for this mom's back pain and disability, I tried to clean it myself. I was loudly retching involuntarily but I almost got it done. I tried my absolute best but had to run to the toilet to be sick. She ended up washing it for me anyway. \n\nI don't understand? This is what makes me doubt it. But everyone I have told the truth, and I havent done much of it here but I give her, most say, way too much slack and excuse for what she does, so if anything I minimize. They are generally are extremely concerned. But she can be so nice sometimes....\n\nI don't know what to think.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

What your seeing is a person who has been ripped open to the core and attacked, over and over again.\n\nWhy didn't you leave? you ask. Well, the powerful hold that the abuser had is unlike anything you have seen in this world, it's practically an addiction, and you know how hard it is to overcome addiction. Too often Addiction kills. Please understand how serious this is. The abuser is smart enough to know he can't be evil the majority of time, he mixes this up with episodes of 'good' treatment.....no 'GREAT' treatment, he can be Amazing. This keeps her craving for the 'GREAT' times when he's being evil again or when she tries to leave. She will also always be second guessing herself about seeing him as evil e.g. \"surely he can't be that bad....\".\n\nIt's not a normal heartbreak, it's not just her heart that is broken, it's deeper than that.

I'm here now. \n\nI've managed to avoid running into Nex completely this year and it's a massive, massive accomplishment that nearly turned me into a hermit, but a happy hermit slowly building my life up again, enjoying a new apartment and different car, eating and drinking in places far removed from Nex's area of town, a new phone number, and even my work site has changed this year! I feel like I've been given my life over here back for the first time in 8 years. \n\nI even joined a local soccer team and met a few new people, including a guy! Not a casual sex type of guy but an interesting, deep, funny, genuine seeming man! We've gone out a few times and it's been so chill and nice. No lovebombing!

Been married for almost 5. He was the quietest, most easy-going man I knew until about 3 or 4 months after we got married. Then the belittling started. He would nag me about something stupid like, \u201cwhy would you wear those shoes with that dress?\u201d, even though his fashion sense was weird (wanted me wearing brown shoes with a black skirt). But then he\u2019d turn right around and say, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to tell you how to dress\u201d. But he\u2019d keep doing it... nagging me about what boots I wore in the garden. He complained that i was wearing a sweatshirt and sweatpants for nearly-autumn canoe trip. He waited til we were halfway there to bitch about my outfit, so i had to turn the car around and change into a sundress and sandals. The looks of the people at the boating place made me feel so ashamed and embarrassed. They thought i was a nut for dressing like that.\n\nBut once i learned what i thought he liked (fancy clothes in the middle of the woods), i dressed in a sundress and sandals again for a walk around the neighborhood. Well now he changed his mind and said i should wear casual clothes &amp; i shouldn\u2019t be told how to dress.\n\nI\u2019ve ended up in the ER twice with panic attacks because of him. I had to sneak my anti-anxiety pills into the house because he doesn\u2019t want me medicated. Just recently I ended up in the ER again due to an ongoing health issue since December. I thought i was going to blackout, but he refused to let me call an ambulance and told me to drive myself. I ended up taking a taxi, but he was livid about that too.\n\nDue to stress &amp; fear of not knowing what will set him off, I\u2019ve developed a weird drawn-up stance where my head is lowered &amp; shoulders are raised, like I\u2019m crouched down. Well, he\u2019s constantly telling me how ugly it looks. I tell him if he\u2019d lay off the BS I\u2019d be able to relax &amp; not be crouched like that. Then he gets mad, says i\u2019m dramatic, childish, always complaining, etc. He says, \u201cAmerican women talk too much\u201d (he\u2019s bosnian). So I stop talking, but then he bitches that i\u2019m being childish by not speaking. He hides my things from me (books, shoes, etc) &amp; denies he does it. But when i find the things placed somewhere weird, he says, \u201coh, i moved it to prove a point\u201d.\n\nHis green card just got renewed &amp; he didn\u2019t tell me this. I managed to stumble across that info. Now he says he\u2019s moving out. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been wanting for years, yet my heart is broken.

And honestly I'm shit scared of having a baby on my own. I do have family I can stay with but I don't want to put on them, and I want her to have an involved Dad. He's great with his kids, but he doesn't have them full time. I think if he was around them more there would be issues, and I'm scared for my daughter to have a narcissistic father. \n\nAbout two weeks ago I watched a video on narcissism, and my lord is everything slotting into place. I'm heartbroken, angry at myself and despairing. Everythings rage then roses and its frustrating as hell. And I'm aware now so I don't fall for the honeymoon phase anymore. I can see all the manipulation, I'm aware but it still gets to me. \n\nHow do I move forward? I really want my girl to be safe and happy and I am so lost as to what I should do. I really love my job here and have made a few friends. But I am so far from my family and so scared to do this alone. \n\nPlease be nice, it's been three years and I haven't confided in anybody. Everythings becoming crystal clear in hindsight but right now I'm in a massive fog and I don't which way is up. \n\nThank you so much for reading x", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Even in the midst of the worse abuse i couldnt break the lust i felt for him.  \n\n\nthe thing is the only way i can feel truly turned on i have to fear the guy  truly fear him at least a little. ive been in so much danger by now, i cant believe i survived. i did that to feel close to him, i messed around with guy who took acid every day because it didnt show up on drug tests and he was in outpatient therapy with me he picked me up zonked out of his mind pupills like black silver dollars and didnt think twice about the risk, he told me early on he was going to rape and kill me and i kept dating him because he told such insane lies i had to discover the truth. even my current boyfriend i thought was a scumbag, turns out hes a great guy,when we met. he was obviously using stimulants, cocainne it turned out, and i thought hed be like him and id get that intence feeling i felt with him.  \n\n\ni feel like i dont deserve being a victom of abuse sometimes because istill miss him and want him to fuck me like a whore, that thats the only thing that gets me off when i felt so uncomfortable when they happend. i felt so guilty because i screamed inside and got dripping wet simultanioslly. i still do. it feels like hes the only one who can give me a sex life where im absolutely present instead of leaving my body, faking it, or just eventually doing it for him out of love and masturbating by myself with fantasies of the spanking my ass and moaning the second i jumped in the car, getting bitt so viciously on my ass i had bruises for days.  \ni felt loved wanted, especially when he bossed me around, it made me feel like he loved me enough to care to even care about me on a daily basis. i went back twice, cheated twice to feel the rush he gave me again. my boyfriend now is the same one who took me back the previous times. even i wonder whats wrong with him then i think of my abuser and remember how despretley i loved my abuser. i hope im not that, ive  committed to him and dont want to be thinking these thoughts. i finally have the sense to appreciate my best friend, my only closest friend and boyfriend and im franly suprised its happening again. this overwhelming urge to speak to him, to have his hands manipulating my body again to please soley himself.   \n\n\ncan i ask what the hell is this, what happend to me and why am i feeling this way??  \ni understand transfurence of the excitement of fear and suprise being confused for love in the brain,\n\ni understand it could be his grooming his slow breaking of my spirit untill id do anything he wanted, like a threesome with his best male freind, that i felt uncomfortable doing.  \n\n\nNow i know him as an adult. or i did, i went back twice to him as an adult and it was almost like we were finally equals and i have nothing to be worried about anymore. that little bit that feels the rage still bubbling beneath my skin only adds to the exotic quality of it. by which i mean the surrieal feeling of going back to your abuser who destroyed you and laughing together like old friends. being fucked by him again and it feeling so right i feel so guilty i write the years of torture off. i cant remeber most of the worst times. ive been diagnosed with ptsd and dissasociation. i forget most things to the point i regulrly get shocked by a assertment that id experienced a whole day of shit and it be 100% wiped out. like someone barrowed my skin and took my place for a while. its so creepy.   \n\n\nanyway sorry for rambling its just coming out and i hope someone reponds. I know he tortured me rellentlessly, deeply in a way that changed me forever. ive seen numerous therapists and all of them 100% agree i went through contiuos soul shattering abuse for years. so what is wrong with me? is making it seem so desirable take away the shame and dirtyness i felt after? please if anyone has insight share it with me, i feel like", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I was flattered my abusers chose me as the one to pursue. I now see, though, the man who sexually harassed me two years ago, didn\u2019t see me as special, as he started going after other women once I rejected him and stopped giving him his narcissist supply. He was lustful of me because of what I provided him: warm, caring, and nurturing energy that fed his ego. He targeted me when I was most vulnerable. Someone recently told me, \u201che didn\u2019t seem me as special, he saw me as easy prey.\u201d This is true as I seemed emotionally unstable (PTSD), out of it, passive, and self-isolated. When I rejected him, and he continually pursued me, he wasn\u2019t fighting for me because he valued and loved me truly\u2014 he wanted to back to use, then discard, and go back to his wife.\n\nMy dad who emotionally and sexually abused me also used me. Both the sexual harasser and my dad groomed me. I thought it was true love from the both of them, but no, their Love/care was conditioned  on me Meeting their emotional and sexual needs that they were not getting from their wives. A key example of my dad\u2019s conditional love was He discarded and ignored my brother at a young age once I came into the picture because my brother could not fulfill his needs. \n\nThese abusers did not see me as truly lovable/valuable... They targeted me because they knew I was vulnerable and craved love and attention. If they truly loved me, they wouldn\u2019t have continuously emotionally and sexually abused me causing me pain.  I wasn\u2019t special to my sexual abuser as He went after other female co workers after I stopped giving him narc supply. My dad also went after my sister once she was born. \n\nThey did not love, respect and value me. However, that does not take away from the fact that I am lovable, valuable and deserve respect. I deserve unconditional love where my needs are focused on in the relationship, too.\n\nWhile I know logically, I should not feel inferior about myself just because they didn\u2019t treat me well... There is still this prominent part of me that is grieving the loss that I wasn\u2019t special or healthily loved by them after all. I even desire to ask my sexual harasser if he even loved me at all. \n\nI also am sad because I saw how my dad treated my mom with respect but put his anger on me, treating me poorly. I wonder if the sexual harasser also treated his wife well\u2014 although of course not as he was attempting to cheat on her. But I wonder if he was also emotionally and sexually abusive to her. How could he not be if narcissism is his nature? Just like Matt Lauer abused his coworkers and also his wife. \n\nSome questions I have for you all:\n\nHow did you come to terms with your abuser treating you terribly but possibly their significant other well?\n\nHow did you come to terms that you were not really special or loved by your abusers? \n\nLastly, Anyone else also feel flattered, special at one point when your abusers chose you as their victim (as any love was better than none)?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She ended up being one of my close friends until I finally cut her off (about 4 years ago). She was generally nice to other people but would sometimes let that drop, especially during text convos with me. So here are two instances that come to mind when I think of her.\n\n1. I had a crush on a guy and told her, then pointed him out to her. She told me he was ugly and that I shouldn't date him. He then had a bit of a glow up and she ended up dating him about a year later.\n\n2. This one is the big one. So on the bus to school, she told me that her mom was pregnant with her half-sister. I congratulated her, of course, and then we stopped talking about it. A few months later, I was talking to another friend of ours (who I'm still friends with today) and I mentioned that nfriend told me that her mom was pregnant. Apparently nfriend was with the other friend at the time, so she asked about it. nfriend told her it wasn't true and that I was lying. I was confused about that, and said that I wasn't lying. Eventually, nfriend took the other friend's phone in order to message me and tell me that I was lying and that I was testing our friendship. She never apologized or anything, and her mom ended up having the baby a little while later. I assume this was her wanting to try to ruin my friendships. \n\n3. She had been dating this guy for a little over a year and had a lot of guys that liked her at our new school (elementary to middle school). He ended up breaking up with her about halfway through the 6th grade school year. She was super upset about it (understandably, she'd been dating him for a while). When I tried to talk to her about it and comfort her, she said she wanted to be left alone and was going to be signing off (kik) for a little while. I didn't push it, but I later found out that she had been talking to everyone else and saying that i was inconsiderate of her emotions and that I didn't care about her at all. (this happened before no. 2).\n\nI eventually decided that I was tired of being called a liar and thought that it was a toxic relationship, so I decided to message her and tell her that I thought it was best if we stopped talking/being friends. She didn't seem surprised. She also ended up moving away, as her mom and step-dad wanted a bigger house. I'm VLC with her, to the point where we don't talk, but I don't have her blocked on anything. I think the reason that she didn't try to stay friends was because 1. she didn't care if I was actually her friend or not, and 2. she other friends to act as her suppliers.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I need some advice and insight. We dated for 9 months. In August 2017, I just moved back home from abroad and met a old classmate at a party. We clicked immediately, hooked up and started seeing each other. He was pretty nice, chill and laid back. He opened up to me after a few weeks, and told me he had prior issues with cocaine, drug dealing, a brief incident with homelessness but assured me it was all in the past. I didn't want to judge him. As we hung out more, I began to see all he would do was smoke weed all day long and he started ditching our plans so I cut him off. Fast forward to August 2018, he added me on Snapchat. We start talking, he tells me how he bought a car for himself finally, how he is a manager at this sports park, and how much he's grown. I believe him, we meet up and we hit it off. He was so kind and caring, he stopped smoking as much and he SWEPT me off my feet. It was insane. He took me on a 3 day camping trip the first month we got together, I got sick during the trip and he took care of me like no ones ever done for me before. He cooked for me, made sure our camper we rented was super clean and he made sure I was happy and comfortable. He told me during the trip (after 3 weeks of dating) that he loved me. I found it odd, but I told him I loved him back. I mean he was so kind to me. Then the white lies started to come out. I saw messages on his phone from a girl. She was really upset he was dating me. I asked why she was so upset, and he told me he didn't know and she was JUST a friend. Then I saw messages showing that they had actually dated right before I got with him, they had kissed and had almost had sex. He lied to me. I almost left him for that , but I couldn't bring myself to leave. He was too nice. He began exhibiting some reckless behaviors like drinking and driving, and smoking and driving. I asked him to stop and he did. Temporarily. But again he was just too sweet. He would make me breakfast every morning, drive me to school, sweet talk me.. I was so in love. He boosted my confidence. Then he started spending the night at my house, and it came to the point he was there every night. We were together for only two months, so I politely asked him if he could only sleep over at my place 2 nights out of the week instead of everyday. He started SOBBING and begging me not to do that. I felt horrible, so I gave in and let him stay. That was the start of something horrible. We spent more time together, and it came to the point where we lived together like husband and wife. I didn't like it but I didn't want to \"hurt\" him by asking for boundaries. One day we argued about something small, and I wanted to leave the room to get some space. He grabs me, throws me on the bed, and pins me down. He doesn't let me leave. I'm begging him to let me go, and I start having a panic attack. He still won't let me go and is pinning me down to the bed, while bear hugging me. I get more panicked. I kept begging him to let go, and finally I snapped and started hitting him so he'd let go of me. He lets go. I feel horrible for hitting him, and he tells me he was pinning me down because he \"loved me\" and wanted to work it out then and there. And the cycle continued. If we had a argument and I needed space, he'd literally hold me hostage in my own room. He wouldn't let me go physically even if I begged him to, and I'd start slapping him so he'd get off of me. He started calling me an abuser and I believed it. If I wanted to take a break so we had time apart, he would not let me. Then the verbal abuse started. One day we were talking on the phone, and he called me a \"broke bitch who only wears Victorias Secret\" and I got so hurt but he shamed me for feeling bad about it because he was only \"joking\" and \"roasting\". I asked him if we could not do that, but he said he would break up with me if I didn't;t want that \"relationship dynamic\" anymore. If I asked for a break, he'd threaten to leave me. In arguments he'd call me a stupid whore, slut and dumb bitch. He'd shame me for my past sexual life. Things got bad with my parents, I was going to move in with a friend but he begged me to stay with him. The first day I was there, he was going upstairs and I asked him if he could take a hairbrush with him upstairs. He started taking it upstairs, stopped, looked at me and said \"Fuck that shit, you fucking do it yourself\" and threw the brush down the stairs. I started crying, and he gaslighted me saying he just \"tossed it and didn't mean it badly\" The relationship got worse, and he would literally constantly hold me hostage during arguments. During one argument, he said all I was his \"bitch, slave, and property\" But I forgave him. We were engaged and I was pregnant. The constant insults broke me down. One day he got mad at me, and dumped tea all over my head. Then he became all nice again..fast forward to this trip to the city. We're listening to music and he's driving so I play music I think we'll both like. He snaps at me angrily for no reason and is like \"shut this shit off, i don't want to hear your crappy music\".... I shut it off and become silent because I was so upset. I told him it upset me, he started taunting me, i called him a cunt for it and he started recording me crying with his phone while verbally abusing me. I slap the phone out his hand, he slams my head into the window and chokes me. I was pregnant at the time. I almost lost consciousness, I beg him to let me out the car. He doesn't let me. He starts pulling my hair, and hitting me. He takes me hostage in my own car by taking my phone. He took me hostage for 12 hours. He did not let me leave the car and anytime I tried he'd hit me and grab me. He also told me he \"hoped he killed my baby\" and recorded himself verbally abusing me for an hour. After a few days I forgive him and ask him to go to counseling. He starts drinking and smoking heavy again. He stops helping in the house. He starts saying disrespectful things about my family. He then tells me he doesn't want to continue going to counseling.. the counselor had told me that she suspected he was using Coke. To be honest, I also thought he was and so did my whole family and friends. His behavior was so erratic and reckless. I ask him if he can take a drug test, he flips out on me, saying he'll leave me, takes my dog and drives off. He comes back after an hour and a half, takes the test. It comes clean, even for Weed (so the test was bullshit bc he had smoked weed that week) and he drives off. But not without elbowing me in the chest. I drive to him, crying, and confused. I'm pregnant and I couldn't understand why he was so mean to me. We chill out for a couple hours.. then he starts drinking. Next thing I know the whole bottle of alcohol is gone. He insists we go to a store to return some of his clothes. He gets behind the wheel, I beg him not to but he does anyway. He starts driving at 65 MPH in a 25 area and I beg him to pull over, he does and I drive instead. We get to the store, first thing he does when he walks in is look at this lady and he sys \"Fuck you fat bitch what are you looking at?\" then to another guy he's like \"Fuck you faggot.\" I say nothing, he returns his clothes. He comes back, he's walking super fast and starts stealing off the shelves. I tell him to stop, he gets angry at me, and he puts the stuff back. We get to the car and he starts yelling at me for telling him what to do. We go back to his home and I try to leave in my car. He doesn't let me go again and physically restrains me from leaving. He takes my keys and phone, and tells me its \"his block\" and no one will help me. He gets angry with me and starts pulling my hair, I start crying. Then he starts verbally abusing me by calling me a Bitch, and I'm struggling to get out his grip. I'm 90 Pounds and he's 160 pounds AND has 3 black belts. He gets more angry and slaps me on the face and chokes me. I ask him why he did that, he gaslights me and lies saying \"Don't you remember? You hit me first\". He drags me in his house, up the stairs, takes my phone and pins me to the bed. He gets on top of me, sobbing and asking why I want to leave him and why I don't love him..? I tell him I don't love him anymore and I want to go home and he pushes my head into the footboard, pushes me out of his room while calling me a slut, bitch, etc.... then he says \"I don't care about you or your Ni\\*\\*er family\" And I'm shocked. I run out his house, I get in my car, he tries to get in my car, I lock the doors and then he gets on top of my windshield and starts punching it. I start recording it and he gets off... I drove home and called the Police. He then calls and texts me saying \"I'm SO sorry, I don't know what happened, please come back\" I block him off my phone, and filed a restraining order. Due to the trauma, I lost the pregnancy a few hours later. My self worth is really shot. It doesn't help some people took his side and I lost a lot of friends bc of it. I've seen him in other relationships, and I saw all the nice things he'd do for them on Valentines day and how he'd take them out to places... he stopped doing that for me early in the relationship. I feel so inadequate and hurt. I just need advice. Guidance. This was horrible and I'm trying to recover from being dehumanized due to being a brown girl and due to him being psychotic.\n\nTL;DR I was in a horrible relationship and I need help", "subreddit": "abuse"}

The biggest part of this is that over the last two years our relationship was perfect. We hardly ever fought, we barley bickered. He was my best freind and we had loads in common.

He always says \" use your logic\" The first few times i confronted him about this, and i felt like he didn't love me when he did it, it turned into an aurgument. Finally desperately when it continued he said he would stop. And he did, untill i would do something that really pissed him off. \nHe bellitles me, about how i drive, my memory loss, my anxiety.

It was from his ex who I've had suspicions and problems with from the very beginning. My narc now-ex is 33, she is 21. This is gross to me. They started dating when she was 17, and it disgusts me. He claimed that they weren't really a couple, they just hooked up which is a lie. He told me at length how much she bored him to tears, how they had nothing in common, how immature she was, how much he never cared about her and hated when she'd come around. He and I had SO much in common, nearly everything. I don't know why he seemingly has chosen to go back to her and seems to have some weird connection with her. It makes no sense to me.\n\nAnyways, it was a lengthy note from her that made me physically ill, and basically confirmed that he had been cheating on me this entire 10 months and was not being emotionally truthful. At some point recently he told her he still loves her while he has been telling me he's never loved anyone like he has me.\n\nI knew exactly what I was getting into in the beginning too. I spotted his narc personality a mile away. But I had just gotten out of a BRUTAL relationship last year and loved the attention he gave. I told myself I'd break up with him after a few months, but I ended up enjoying his company far more than anticipated so I stuck around despite at least 100 red flags. \n\nI met him at my new job where his ex was our manager. To keep things short, he constantly lied to me about how serious their relationship had been. Whenever I'd find something at his house, he'd have an excuse. I knew deep down it was her. He always had an excuse. He's a compulsive liar. He lies about EVERYTHING. But he had the sweet words when I wanted to hear them.\n\nWe come from very different backgrounds and I wonder if that's why. He is trouble spelled with a capital T. In and out of prison, drug addiction, multiple baby mamas, disrepectful attitude. I am not that at all. He would often say things about how he wasn't good enough for me, but that's not fair. And it certainly doesn't give him the right to cheat.\n\nHe wouldn't tell me why he's been lying and possibly cheating either. He shut down and didn't say a word when I confronted hin besides yelling at me to get out of his house and calling me a stupid b*tch. I didn't even get the respect of knowing why or what was happening. And what hurts the worst is knowing he left to probably go to her place and tell her we finally broke up and that he's sooo in love with her. The exact words he'd say to me. \n\nI feel pathetic, gross, used, embarrassed, and humiliated. I have never been cheated on before. He told me exactly who he is in the beginning, that he feels no empathy for people. That he's likely a sociopath. He's cheated in all his relationships. I stupidly thought I could turn him good.

It's had its highs, and lows, I've been hit with tactical nukes, I've survived the fallout...but where do I go from here? How do I reclaim who I was? \n\nI have this friend J, who also has a nex. And we started seeing each other more and more. She made the suggestion that we go see fireworks with her roommate...and we sat on a blanket and ate turkey clubs and watched fireworks...and it dawned on us that our Nex's would never do this. They would never be caught dead there, among families and crowds. \n\nI made the suggestion we do more things like that together...and so it went. We started going to places our Nex's would never go with us to. Never take us places to, never do the things we loved....we went to a barcade last night and we played Air hockey and ski ball...two things my nex loved to do...and you know what...I felt like a piece of me came back. \n\nWe made new memories...and the old ones began to fade away...\n\nWe walked 1.2 miles today in a large park today and talked about our triggers, our lives, we actively listened to each other and took in the view.\n\nMy point here...reclaim the land they took from you and start making new memories. Start small, start by going places they would never take you. Eat the food they hated, do what they hated.\n\nAnd you make new memories.\n\nReclaim you.\n\nAs with me and J, I admit feelings are there...but we have boundries and for the first time in my life I understand why we have them. If something develops there, I would be fine with it. If not, I understand why and know that her recovery should come first for her.

To give you a run down of the abuse that goes on in my house..\n\nMy brother punches me in the face when ever I say something that he didn\u2019t want to hear. It could just be a normal conversation about bees or something and he would get triggered. He claims he \u201cblacks out and doesn\u2019t remember doing it\u201d but I KNOW it\u2019s a bunch of bullshit, he did not black out. When people black out, they don\u2019t stop. That\u2019s his excuse so it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s his fault. \n\nHe\u2019s done this multiple times in front of my mom and my husband. My husband didn\u2019t do anything the first 3 times. He\u2019s not that type of guy who fights violence with violence. He basically tells me to forgive him every time. Yeah I\u2019m pissed off that he didn\u2019t stand up for me, but hey you can\u2019t make anyone do anything they don\u2019t want to do. I can\u2019t make someone stand up for me, you feel? \n\nThe last time he gave me a black eye was when I was pregnant. (Last year) This was all because I didn\u2019t have dinner ready in time. It\u2019s like walking on egg shells around this dude. Like I don\u2019t fucking get it, I help him and he still beats me? \n\nHe punched 3 holes in the wall last week when I asked him to please bring up HIS laundry that had been sitting in the basement for almost a week. I did it for him the last 3 times, so it\u2019s only fair if he did it this one time. It wasn\u2019t even going to take more than a minute. But no, he must be disrespectful and then punch 3 holes in the wall. You believe this shit? He comes home later on that day and starts to threaten me by saying next time those holes could be me. I shit you not these are his exact words, \u201cnext time you shut your mouth and fucking bring my shit up stairs you dumb bitch, those holes could you your fucking face next time. You got lucky this time.\u201d \n\nI got lucky? How about you shouldn\u2019t put your fucking hands on me?!\n\nIn 2017, he literally beat me till my face was bloody all because I was listening to music while I was folding my laundry. I have a picture. I don\u2019t know how to post pictures on reddit post. I\u2019m still very new but I\u2019d be willing to once I learn how. Anyways, I called the fucking cops but since he was 17, all they did was tell him not to do it again and left.\n\nThis is just the TIP of the iceberg. There\u2019s so much more he has done that is so hard to put into words. \n\nHe literally puts his hands on my mom too. He has choked her out, called her a bitch on multiple occasions, and told her to her face that if she was dying, he\u2019d just let her die. My mom is a single mother (dad left us for another women when I was 7-8) my brother doesn\u2019t resent him for leaving, in fact he loves my dad so much. My dad visits us maybe once ... a year? Anyways, my brother is your typical compulsive manipulator and liar. \n\nOkay, so here is where it gets even more stressful. Because he abuses my mom, she submits to him and gives him what ever he wants. She wants him to move out and all he does is say no, goes up to his rooms and locks the door. He has 2 rooms in this house, pays no rent, she pays his phone bill for him, he does not go to school, he does not have a job, and he essentially gets whatever he wants and if he doesn\u2019t someone is getting hurt for it. When she refuses to buy him food, he literally pins her down in the bed and screams at her until she agrees to give him 200 for food. \n\nI know they say that you shouldn\u2019t worry about anyone else but yourself, but I really think it\u2019s fucking shitty that my mom says that I need to clean after my brother and everyone in this house or she is going to kick my family out. Also, I must pay rent and any other thing she deems is necessary. I don\u2019t mind paying to live in a SAFE environment. I don\u2019t mind keeping the house clean. What I do mind is the fact that everything is so biased. She\u2019s been trying to pin the electric bill on me, but I don\u2019t understand why I have to pay for electricity when EVERYONE uses it?! My brother has two rooms with the lights on 24/7. I have one small room\nand I usually open my blinds for light. All I\u2019m saying is my brother should have to pay. If she\u2019s charging me and making me clean, the least she could do is treat him the same. I understand why she does what she does and it\u2019s because she fears him, but come on bruh. That\u2019s your fucking kid man, do SOMETHING. You can just fucking gamble your life away and ignore everything. I can\u2019t be the one taking responsibility for something I didn\u2019t create. \n\nI have told my mom to stop fucking submitting to him. He is your fucking child and not your owner. He should get the same responsibilities I do. But no, because I am a girl, I must clean the entire house everyday and cater to everyone\u2019s needs to shut my mouth. \n\nYou don\u2019t even understand how much that frustrates me. Because of my GENDER, I must conform and submit to abusive behavior. Because of my GENDER, I am not allowed the same freedom as my brother. \n\nRecently, I told my mother I will not do any more favors for him, that means if it\u2019s his mess, he cleans it. If he wants clean clothes, he needs to do it. If he wants a ride somewhere, he figures it out. I have spent a good chunk of my life catering to his needs. \n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s your brother you should love him.\u201d no fuck him. I forgive him. BUT MY GOSH FUCK HIM. I am done being there for my abuser. Abuse is abuse. I don\u2019t care what anyone says. THERE SHOULD NO REASON I SHOULD BE GETTING HURT FROM MY FAMILY MEMBERS. Especially, in my 20s. \n\nI could go on and on about how much pain I am in, but all I\u2019m really looking for is a solution to my issue. I\u2019ve tried forgiving him, I tried building a relationship with him, I tried being a good sister to him, I tried ignoring him, but it always ends up with me literally getting hurt. \n\nI am done. I am done with him. I am done taking responsibility for everything. I need to get out of here. I don\u2019t care how hard I have to work, I MUST get out of here. \n\nOh did I mention he wants me to let him hang out with my 1 year old daughter. He literally gets upset when I tell him I don\u2019t feel comfortable with that. He gets a upset that he starts to call me a bitch or a fucking slut etc etc. The other day he asked to shower with my daughter alone. LIKE WTF NO. \n\nI am literally in tears! I don\u2019t know how to make it stop. I don\u2019t want this abuse anymore. I don\u2019t want my daughter to grow up watching mommy getting beat by uncle because she didn\u2019t do what he wanted her to do. I don\u2019t want her growing up potentially getting beat herself or molested. \n\nI am not going to go down the same road as my mom. Someone please help educate me. How do I get out of this mess safely? I don\u2019t want my mom to hate me, but she seems completely find living like this. \n\nI can\u2019t go to my friends because I don\u2019t have any that actually care about me. All I have are friends on Facebook and these are just people that like my post. \n\nI am trying to find a way to move out, but of course money is the issue. \n\nI am currently going to college. I have at least 30k in student loans so far. The only reason why I even considered taking on so much debt is because of how badly I wanted to get away from the abuse. I have a part-time job, but I barely make a consistent 600 a month. My husband works but he only brings home about 1,000-1,500 a month and he\u2019s also in school. \n\nWith rent being about high as a giraffes neck, it\u2019s almost impossible to find a clean studio apartment to rent. All of the studio apartments and basements in my area range from 1,350-1,800+ and I don\u2019t know how much more debt I can afford. All of my grandparents are dead, my aunts and uncles don\u2019t even know what I look like anymore, and I don\u2019t have any actual relatives that live in the United States. I have no other family to help. My husbands family is dirt poor. His mom currently lives in a 2 bedroom apartment with 6 people. I don\u2019t think my family would be able to fit in that small apartment. \n\nSorry for this extremely long and depressing post. Sorry for all the profanity. I normally just bottle it all inside me, but I can\u2019t take it anymore. This is my last resort. \n\nThank you very much for your time.

Eventually it became a more \u201cserious\u201d relationship, and we stayd togheter for as nearly as 2 years. \n\nHe literally destroyed my mind, leaving me confused, lost and broken. I acknowledged my trauma and his \u201cnature\u201d after a lot of time. I\u2019m still healing today. But i can say that i had a little revenge against him. \n\nSo, today im in a loving relationship with a guy, im calling him A., who also happend to be my everlasting crush back in high school. I saw him the first time when i was 15 and he was 19, while he was singing with his band at a concert organized by my school, and he just blew my teenage mind. ( Me, A., but also Nex, came from the same small town, where do you have that type of \u201ci know who you are and what you do even if we aren\u2019t friends or i never spoke to you directly\u201d relationship) so I often talked about  A. with my friends , but never had contact with him, until I started dating  him at the age of 21. \nI can say he\u2019s the greatest guy i ever met and im just so lucky to have him in my life.\n\nBut.\n\nThere\u2019s more.\nYou know that feeling with a narcisist when you voluntary avoid saying/doing things for the solely purpose of avoid the abuse. Well, that\u2019s why  i knew at the time, when i was still with my Nex, that i couldn\u2019t mention A. or acknowledge his existince for any reason at all. Even if he was an old crush (and nothing else) from the past. Even if sometimes my friends and i still joked about my \u201cunrequieted love\u201d for him. It was between me and my friends only, with no need of interference from the outside.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case. One night, me my friends and my Nex we were all togheter for a nightout, drinking and chatting. The main topic was \u201c with whom would you like to have sex without blinking, among the people you know?\u201d (so basically the entire town). I tried to avoid the question with all my force, eventually i didn\u2019t give an answer, until one of my friends naively mentioned A. and how i had a big crush for him. \n\nThat was it. After the nightout I stayed alone with the Nex, destroyed by his jealousy, throwing shit at me for being a shitty gf, like if i had cheated him with A. I tried to calm him down for the rest of\nthe night. His manipulative and controlling behaviour just went full mode and it increased after this episode. \nHe felt for the first time threated.\nFrom this moment every time i was in a situation where also A. was involved (and that was easy, because we literally have 3 bars in our town), he quickly became hypervigilant and annoyed for everything.\n\nafter a lot of time from this argoument and after descending in more and more sick behavior i just forgetted about it, and never taught it was still a problem (mostly because the problems were other). \nThat was until  a big festivity which involved the entire town, and where you basically get drunk, dance and generally have a good time. i found myself in a large group of people dancing and jumping around (a sort of pogo-like dancing). In that mess i was more facilitated to ignore the insistent calls from the Nex, who didn\u2019t want to take part at the dancing at all but wanted ME to stay with him at all cost, even if he was drinking and smoking with other people/friends. \nSo i just didn\u2019t care and continued dancing. Among that mess there was also A., drunk and jumping around. \nAnd i feel sorry for him still today.\nI turned my head around for 1 sec and i saw the Nex (who just followed me and showed up suddenly), going straight forward the dancing pit, at first nonchalantly dancing/jumping, but when the pogo became \u201cstronger\u201d, the Nex just grabbed A. from his waist and slam dunked him in the ground. Couldn\u2019t believe it. At first i just didnt understand. When i started to understand i just burshed it off immediatly. I didn\u2019t tell the Nex a thing nor acknowledged his actions. \nOn the other hand A. did get a little hurt but nothing serious. And he called out the Nex for that (in my presence) later that night.\n\nI broke up with him 2 months later.\nIt was a slow healing process, then i met A. for real. Started a relationship with him. Never mentioned what happened with the Nex (even if A. knows is a shitty abusive person).  And one of the first time i talked to A., the Nex saw us (it was a pure coincidence). It just went blank eyed making comments that i was disgusting. \nHis face changed completely, he became quiet and look defeated.\nI think that was the moment he realized that even with all the effort to try to lure me back to him, he hadn\u2019t a chance. I couldn\u2019t be his victim anymore.\n\nI was lucky because that helped me a lot in a phase where i wasn\u2019t already aware of what i\u2019ve being through, and it facilitated the  No Contact.\n\nAnd im glad that too many coincidences and a bit of karma just punched him back in the ass :)", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I knew she had depression, anxiety and went to counselling for her bad past but didn't know the details for much about her family, I remember asking her age once but she never told me just brushed it off. Anyway around the same time things were going really bad for her I was going through a pretty rough spot and that's when I realised that she didn't really care or notice and was toxic, so I left for a year no contact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a long year of healing but I was feeling more my self, so I checked on facebook for the first time in a long time and she was with a new guy and she seemed to be really happy, so I said we should catch up. Things were great, said her ex was a narcissist (her councillor pointed that out) and she's recovering now, at first her new bf was a bit jealous of me at first but it was ok for a while, she was saying he was perfect  things had been going great and it's only the first 3 months or so, however they both had been in very toxic and damaging relationships before this one, and she was telling my all about his abusive relationship with his ex. anyway about 5-6 months in to their relationship they were having troubles and it was getting worse all the time. I noticed she was blaming me or others for her behaviour, I said you need to take responsibility for your actions, she unconvincingly said fine ok before disregarding my advice and reverting back to her ways, sometimes she would even say sorry it's my past or my mother. I told her one of the things that helped me is to look inwards an take ownership of my behaviour, then act upon, she asked me how. I even remember her counsellor telling her she needs to put herself in other peoples shoes, asked herself how can I do that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway more than 6 weeks back she was learning about narcissist and npd properly, she had bought a book about my mother is a narcissist or something like that and she heavily related to the neglecting abuse and got me to read it and she was asking questions about my past and I realised how different our experience of growing up was as I had a pretty average childhood (just a lot of being bullied at school as well as having ADHD and eventually GAD later on), also I found out she has a sister, the truth about her mother and father and other partners her mother had. Anyway I didn't relate to it but I felt really bad for her and what she was telling me like it was really heavy stuff, and by this point I was getting really worn down again by her constant drama and petty arguments. And then she was sent me a couple of videos of about narcissism and OMG!! I felt completely awful.. About her current boyfriend and what she put him though, but also what he was doing to her too and what her ex did to her. And then I realised I noticed traits in her too. So I looked up more and more information about this and realised the truth even though I didn't want to believe it. She was projecting on to me, using me as a mirror, she even said that everyone she knew might be a narcissist as she sees these traits, even her counsellor is one, and maybe even me, and that we need to find my trauma (which doesn't exist).\n\nOne of the major things she said to me was, I've never felt cared for by anyone, I love you, but I've never felt loved. (like brotherly sisterly love). This was after 6 weeks of me going round her flat, helping her though another difficult time with the on/off brake up with her boyfriend, helping her clean the flat, cook, doing her dishes without her asking just because you know, I cared, and that's what she says.\n\nI couldn't believe it, and the more I looked up the more I saw through the mask. Anyway so I started doing group cbt and had tried to cut back time talking to her and spending time with her in order to have a healthier friendship and generally a more balanced life, around this time she was spending some time with her back up guy and even making out with him behind her on/off bf back, she also slept with another guy that used to be good friends with the bf (she broke off their friendship cause he was toxic), something she also did with her ex, ex too.\n\nAnyway she didn't take the hint and kept messaging or calling me so I ignored her for a bit before catching up again a few weeks later and she then blew up, her controlling tactics weren't working, my heart was racing but I remained calm from the strategies I had learnt not to give her a reaction. She didn't know what to do so she discarded me claiming she didn't feel safe even though she was the one being aggressive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI knew it would happen and pretty much confirmed everything for me. it's been a few weeks no contact now but I need to get money back from her. Luckily I wasn't too trusting of her because I got written proof of the lending in email but unfortunately I do need to contact her about getting at least some of this money back, any advice if anyone has been through this would be great.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you if you made it this far and read my story, I didn't intend for it to be this long just wanted to get it off my chest and share it to anyone that might relate or understand. My bro has been really supportive and the only one who really knows most of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso top tip, turn your spotify to private. She would stalk people on spotify feed to know how her ex's and friends were feeling, and even stalking insta and whatsapp's/fb  last active.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\np.s sorry in advance if there is grammer issues, this is a throw away account to protect myself a bit but I will be back to check comments and reply was I'm on here with my other account :) I've been reading stories from people on here and found the courage to just post my own story. also realising just how predictable N's behaviours are, is kinda weird.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was helping her, everything was fine. Than she complained about the house smelling bad (we have 3 cats) and I said I cleaned the litter so I wasn\u2019t sure why.\n\nWe discovered the cats peed in a box with dvds and she freaked out at me. Screaming about how I never check anything. I was confused of why she was freaking out at me so I said I didn\u2019t want to fight and that I would clean it. It made things worse as she threw the keys in her hand into the kitchen, knocking stuff over. Screaming about how I was making excuses??? I was so confused of what I was doing wrong? I just started saying sorry and that I\u2019ll clean it, she just started screaming about how I\u2019m purposefully slacking off or something.\n\nShe stormed out and left back to work. I stood confused of what I did wrong? I got to cleaning because she called me, screaming at me. I tried asking what I did wrong to be told to shut the fuck up, and that I was purposefully triggering her ptsd and anxiety, that I didn\u2019t care about her mental health. That I\u2019m purposefully making her life miserable. I went along with what she said cause every time I tried to say that wasn\u2019t true, she said I was lying.

For real this time.", "author": "Starfruit11", "self_text": "I've (28f) been with my bf(30m) on and off for 6 yrs. I broke up with him about 1.5yrs ago, ended up getting myself screwed over by someone that I was taken advantage of also (from my past).  \nI believed in all of his promises and lies, and took my bf back after 4 months of being broken up. He proposed to me, but I told him I wasn't ready (this was right when we got back together). He said he'd do anything to stay with me and to be in my life. That me and my dog are his whole world.  \nI got so sick of his negativity and abuse when I broke up with him the first time. I was seeking refuge and got myself involved with someone that I shouldn't have trusted. He was probably also a sociopath. I didn't know anything about these personality types at the time or why I'd find myself being disrespected constantly by a romantic partner.\n\n  \nThere has always been so much drama between us. It's never felt totally happy and free and stable. Even when its been stable, its been problematic it seems like. I've had times when I thought he was perfect and that I could trust him. We have the same values, the same lifestyle, the same taste in music for the most part although we learned about new things from eachother that we enjoyed. But he just spins my head around when we get into discussions that escalate and turn into him lecturing me about how I'm flawed and need to fix myself for the relationship to work. He twists things around and confuses me and then points the finger at me when I'm clarifying and defending myself about things.   \nI'm just done with it all. Last night he told me that he doesn't do things (ANYTHING) out of 'fear' of what I think or have to say about it. For example: he doesn't play drums because his mom might complain about it (she never does). He doesn't go for a run because he thinks I've criticized him for going running for long periods of time as a distraction (which I never said). I spend my time then clarifying to him thats something he's made up in his own mind and its not reality.\n\n  \nI am not to blame for everything that's wrong with his life. He does this in a very low key way. He does it to his mother too and when I called him out on that, he told me I was being manipulative and called it triangulation! He pushes me until I start reacting how he wants me to and then acts calm and makes it a point about how cool he's being. Its so effed up and when I find myself in the moment of that situation, I feel like kicking myself!!!\n\n  \nToday I messaged him that its officially over. He gave me no credit for all of my support for him. I'm always encouraging him. I'm always trying to motivate him or take him somewhere new. I'm always bringing food for us to make and learn to prepare new things together. I've learned a lot from him and have grown a lot from him and I still love him. But this is just insanity.   \nWhen we started the relationship, I was a lot more insecure. I was 30lbs heavier and have had a record of guys just using me and I was seeking validation. I was super codependent and enjoyed the validation of someone needing me. I'm no longer that same girl. I am more confident now, more physically attractive (not that it matters), more intelligent and emotionally aware. I've been letting this guy hold me back from reaching my full potential and he's controlled everything I've done for so long.   \nI thought maybe I'd end up with him forever because its already so hard to find someone with the standards I have, but I'm just done with relationships. I've been disappointed by so many humans in my life.  \nI thought I needed him, but I realize I can't even be his friend. I need to completely cut him out.   \nHe's still living at home with his mom. He's working part time work from home jobs. He doesn't help contribute to anything other than cooking dinner and occasionally watched my dog. When we did live together, it was a nightmare.   \nI don't know how I stayed so stuck for what feels like a majority of my life.\n\nSend help&lt;3", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

{"post_id": "caqbbq", "created_utc": 1562617025, "title": "Groomed and sexually abused by my father.", "author": "day2day77", "self_text": "I really don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about this. I go to therapy for OCD, and when I finally told my therapist about the abuse, we worked on redirecting my thoughts and setting boundaries, typical CBT stuff. But I guess I never felt like I could truly talk all of this out. I told my fianc\u00e9 the short version of it, but for reasons I\u2019ll explain below I feel like it\u2019s selfish to talk about it in depth. So I will start from the beginning. \n\nI feel it is important to preface with the personalities of my parents. \n\nMy mother met my father in college and got married at the age of 21, and had my sister at the age of 22. Prior to my father she has no dating experience or really life experience. As soon as she had my sister her life became solely about her children. She did everything for us and loved us immensely. She did not work, and her only priority was her two girls. This is not to say she is not without fault. She turned a blind eye to so much of what happened in the house. While we always viewed my mother as the \u201cboss of the house\u201d, at the end of the day my father made the money and had the final decision. My mom had no interest in having financial independence and liked being taken care of financially. So at the end of the day, as long as she was taken care of, she was happy. \n\nMy father is only a little older than my mother. He came from a very abusive household. He has two personalities that seem to be completely separate from one another. He could scream in your face one hour, and the next hour he would act completely confused as to why you were upset. If you ever confronted him about his bad behavior he would act like he has no idea what you were talking about. He would become the nicest and most caring person in the world and try to make you feel better. Any acts of anger on his part was always followed by this overly nice guy, total denial act. My entire upbringing in regards to my father was 100% gaslighting. \n\nI never saw my parents be affectionate to each other or say \u201cI love you\u201d. They slept in different bedrooms and were generally cordial to one another. I view their marriage as transactional. He had a wife that did everything, and she was taken care of financially. \n\nI have one older sister who is about 5 years older than me. We were normal sisters who fought and played like siblings. Any time my sister and I fought (from ages 5 to 9) my father would always intervene on my behalf. He was always far more aggressive with my sister. My sister was always spanked more, yelled at more, etc. There was even a point in time when he nearly broke her arm. In private, my father would tell me that I was his favorite. That my sister was failure. He would build me up while tearing my sister down. Even from a young age it made me feel uncomfortable. I knew I was treated differently than her. \n\nMy first recollection of sexual abuse occurred when I was 11. My maternal grandparents were visiting, and I was alone in my bedroom while the rest of my family was visiting with my grandparents. My father came into my room and sort of half laid on my body. He started to massage my legs until he reached the tops of my thighs right by my vagina. He then moved to \u201cmassaging\u201d my backside under my shorts and underwear . I just remember laying there, feeling uncomfortable but not knowing what to say. \n\nFor the next 5 or so years my father would continue to grope and rub my thighs and backside under my clothes under the guise of a massage. The preferential treatment of me over my sister continued to persist during these five years. My father would pay for my after school activities and not my sister\u2019s. Since my mom was a stay at home mom she didn\u2019t have a ton of say about finances. Even though my father seemed to hate my sister, he was OBSESSED with her. He downloaded spyware on the computer to read all of my sister\u2019s AOL messages. He wanted to know her every move, conversation, etc. he hated that she dated boys, and would always allude that she was a slut. In my father\u2019s eyes I could do no wrong and my sister was the trouble child. \n\nMy sister coped with everything by staying out of the house as much as possible. Even though my dad tried to get my sister in trouble through all of his spying, my sister was crafty about getting around her perpetual groundings. She would make up fake jobs so that she was able to leave the house. When my sister wasn\u2019t grounded, she was always staying overnight at a friends house, or even in her car if necessary. My mother went along with the groundings, but not for the same reason as my father. She was just genuinely strict and any misbehavior earned my sister several weeks worth of groundings. \n\nI coped by withdrawing. I stopped socializing as much and started self harming. I would spend my free time on the computer where I could escape my reality. I had a very small circle of friends that I could hang out with. But I felt strange bringing them over to my house. My father would always try to showboat around them and pretend to be the most loving and doting father. \n\nWhen I was around 15 I started to hate my father. At a younger age, I realized what he was doing made me uncomfortable, but at 15 I started to realize it was sexual. I started to fight back against the abuse. Anytime he tried to slip his hand down my pants or grope / slap my backside in passing I would literally yell \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d My mom would ask why I was yelling and he would just say that we were playing. I continued this tactic until eventually he stopped all together at the age of 16. At this time I was able to get a full time job and I started taking college classes part time at the local community college. I adjusted my entire life schedule so that we would almost never cross paths. We didn\u2019t have much interaction for the next two years as I was always working or at college. \n\nI went away to a 4 year university at 18, but I developed severe panic attacks towards the end of my first semester. I came home for the Christmas break and was exploring my options to transfer to a smaller university that was more affordable. That\u2019s when my father had a debilitating stroke. I secretly hoped he would just die. He became completely handicap on the right side of his body and suffered brain damage as well. Both my sister and I came home for the next 6 months to help my mom care for my father. \n\nLess than 12 months after my father\u2019s stroke, my mom divorces my dad and completely severed ties with him. My sister and I became responsible for caring for my father after that. We were able to set him up in his own apartment, but anytime he needs anything, it fell to my sister and myself. For the last 10 years this has been our life. My sister and I care for our father part time. We grocery shop for him, help him to doctors appointments, clean up for him, cut his hair, even help him pay his bills. Since he is so helpless, I have always felt too guilty to not take care of him. I cannot begin to explain how trapped I have felt the last ten years. My sister always took less responsibility than me when it came to taking care of our dad. I would be over to his apartment several times a week and she would only go by once a month or so. I felt like all of the responsibility of taking care of my father fell on me. I had considered suicide. I considered just packing up and leaving the state one day without telling anyone. I just wanted to be free of him.  \n\nAbout 4 years ago I finally had a break down. I couldn\u2019t stop having panic attacks. I was having constant intrusive thoughts. I took FMLA and went through really intensive therapy which I still continue today.  Therapy gave me the strength to tell my sister about the sexual abuse I experienced. She divulged that she too was molested by my father, but at a much younger age than myself. But after that one conversation my sister and I have never talked about it again . I later told my mother, but she sort of brushed it off. She didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I have told my fianc\u00e9 but not in great detail. Since I still have to care for my father, my fianc\u00e9 hating my father would just make matters that much more difficult. \n\nWhile I do feel like I have a lot more control over my life, there is a part of me that feels trapped. Any time I have to see my father, I have nightmares about the sexual abuse. I feel sick when I hear his voice. I try to keep myself rooted in the present, but it can be difficult at times.

I exhibited some pretty extreme behavioral disturbances and learning disabilities from this point on, and was pathologized/medicated/subjected to medical malpractice and neglect. While I came out about the abuse in 2009, I was abused and abandoned by my parents and sent to troubled teen programs for a year afterwords. I have recently, along side a host of realizations about the abusive nature of my parents and medical professionals, began to remember being raped by my abuser for the first time in my life. \n\nOne of the medications I was put on almost immediately after my behavioral disturbances began was trileptal, an antieplieptic  used to treat mood disorders in children. I have very few memories of the time between 2004 and 2006 when I was taken off trileptal. While I largely attribute this to the fact that this was the time period where I was being raped and abused, I am wondering if anybody here has any experience/resources on the effects of psychotropic medications on the memories of traumatized children. If the medication I was forced to take did cause memory impairment, then it gives nuance to the picture (or lack thereof) I have of the time in my life where I was being harmed. For clarification, I was 9 years old when I was put on trileptal. I\u2019m also open and interested in hearing the experiences of any other kid survivors who were medicated early in response to their trauma.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

My Nex seems to be back to living with his new supply. I\u2019m 33 days no contact. What would have been our 7 year anniversary is coming up on the 13th. I\u2019m still so angry and still searching for answers, I feel desperate to know \u201cwhat\u2019s going on\u201d. He found his new girlfriend after being with me in an \u201copen\u201d marriage for 4 years. He literally told me she was disposable and not to worry about her. It wasn\u2019t until December (fully 6+ months after I broke up with him because he was being dishonest with me about her, in April 2018 he said he broke up with her but wouldn\u2019t stop hanging out with her- I just knew he was lying about her) it wasn\u2019t until last year that I finally met with her. He had been telling me that she was unstable and if I talked to her it could result in her ending her life. Apparently, he told her the same thing about me. We told each other everything and went on this weird Odessey where a stranger drugged us... a huge fucked up story. She and I were talking on and off from December through till recently- sort of- she blocked me because it was just excruciating every time we talked. \n\nBut I\u2019m fairly certain that when he came back from travelling in May (he was gone Jan-may, again told me he ended things with her before he left).... when he came back in May, I think they got back together. Part of going no contact with him these past 33 days that has been so hard has been my struggle with my feelings for her. We are definitely trauma bonded. I feel absolutely sick anytime I think of her. I feel terror that she\u2019s gone back to her absuser, and anger, sadness and self pity that he has \u201cchosen her\u201d over me. He triangulated us both so cruelly because each of us was aware of the other. The last time I spoke with her she said she was thinking of me all the time. At first I told her I wanted to talk, but then I caught myself trying to get her to confirm if she was back together with him. Back in May she said, that it was up to him to share what was going on- which just made me feel that she\u2019s back with him and he\u2019s controlling her into silence either by deamonizing me or simply by being forceful about his \u201cprivacy\u201d which he always was with me. He was so enraged anytime I knew something about him from someone else or from snooping his phone, he would just scream about my violating him- clearly in order to avoid addressing the mind bending dissonance I was experiencing listening to him talk and observing his utterly divergent behavior. \n\nALL I want to do is contact her today and ask her what\u2019s going on. I saw pictures on his Facebook of him at her place, so I know what she\u2019ll say. I just feel out of my mind. I am doing everything I can think of to just let it all go, and forget about them both. But it\u2019s so so hard today. \n\nAny help and wisdom is appreciated. Have you experienced a deep and difficult relationship with your Nex\u2019s other victims?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I recently read the book \"Psychopath Free,\" and a bunch of things just clicked for me. There were lists of how they act and his behavior checked off every item. \n\nThe section on triangulation was really eye opening for me. My nex triangulated me with his ex, who he described as crazy, unhinged, and abusive. At the same time, he wanted to keep regular contact with his ex, share a dog with him weekly, and said he hoped they could be friends. I realize now this was about keeping his ex hooked as another source.\n\nHe also triangulated me with a \"friend\" who he was out with til 4am one night. I asked if I had anything to worry about, and he said \"no. We're just friends. We stayed up late playing video games.\" I said ok, but can I meet him, just to set my mind at ease? He agreed, and then for 8+ weeks delayed, gaslit me, stonewalled, crazy talked in circles, threatened to leave me, and all the other tactics to make sure we never met. He confided in me that he had been complaining about our relationship to this friend. Finally just before the discard he said \"[friend] likes me romantically.\"\n\nNot only this, but he triangulated me with coworkers and friends I hadn't met. He would say things like \"oh, everyone at work thinks this one coworker is gay, but he says he's straight. I don't know though, he wanted to sit on my lap when we all took a cab and there weren't enough seats.\" He then paused and looked at me for a reaction. I was hurt, but I didn't say anything. \n\nHe also made a point of telling me that one of his co-workers wanted to introduce him to some gay clients, and he had told her oh, no, I have a boyfriend. At the time I was relieved and grateful to be the boyfriend. I tried to see it as a story to show his commitment to me. In reality it was about trying to make me jealous, and keep me off center. \n\nWe had plans to spend quality time together one night, and he announced that he had gone ahead and made plans with a coworker to go to a gay night club that night. He knew I worked the next day, and pretended to have \"forgot.\" When I expressed I was hurt by him making other plans on our date night he became angry that I expected him to \"cancel\" on his friend. Nevermind that he was in reality cancelling our special night.\n\nI asked if this was the same coworker that he had previously said wanted to set him up on dates with clients and he pretended he had no idea what I was talking about. I searched our chat history and sent a screenshot. He became FURIOUS about it. He said I overthink, I question too much, that I was starting a fight. I said no, I was reminding you since you said you forgot. He said he has to think before he talks because it might be used against him, that I was confronting him with things he \"had no knowledge of\" (his own words???). It turned into a huge circular conversation with tons of confusion and changing the subject by him. Eventually he said he'd cancel the other plans like he was doing a big favor to keep our date night, and that he still didn't understand why I was upset. \n\nSo, post discard, I went no contact but have checked his Instagram account.. it was his birthday and I was curious. He posted a bizarre post with a picture of a rose shaped cake, captioned \"I got so emotional, baby,\" and with a bizarre hashtag that said, in an edited form because it's vulgar #no****tonight (a reference to sex) and something like #friendsnight (edited slightly for anonymity). I couldn't make sense of it, because it's not normal behavior, until I read about triangulation.\n\nThey will triangulate anyone with anyone, even if they have to invent scenarios to do it. I couldn't think who that message could possibly be for or what it could mean. It suddenly dawned on me that he, maybe, was trying to make it look like someone had got him a special cake (which could make his other sources curious/jealous/insecure), make someone wonder who \"baby\" is, and the sexual comment likewise could make them feel the same way. But any normal person would just text their beau, hey I'm with friends so #no****tonight, rather than broadcasting it on Instagram. \n\nIt's been exhausting for me to look back on  things that happened, or have memories come up when I read books on covert abuse, but for me it has been necessary to begin to really understand that he IS pathological, and that the person I loved never even existed.. it was all manipulation and lies.\n\nedit: I looked again. He updated his bio to say \"my pu**y tastes like pepsi cola\" (a Lana Del Rey song quote) and posted another selfie with the caption \"let me put on a show for you daddy\"  Looking at this stuff isn't helping me at all, even though it makes me realize he isn't at all who I thought he was.

If I may share some backstory (all names changed, and sorry for the length):\n\nI was married to M for four years. He is not a narc; he was, and still is, a good guy. The relationship felt comfortable at first, because I had come off a string of relationships with unavailable men. Not narcs -- just unavailable: married or commitment-phobic or \"just not that into me.\" It felt good to share space with someone, each of us doing our own thing, and not obsessing over \"Why is he watching his TV show/working on his motorcycle/doing whatever random thing and not paying attention to meeeee?\"\n\nTurns out that was not enough to build a lasting relationship. We had comfort but, at least on my end, very little passion. And very little in common. He actively disliked some of my interests, and I was meh about some of his.\n\nI met B through one of my interests that M disliked. We started as friends, but I soon developed strong feelings for him. **Well then, obviously I picked wrong when I picked M, and B is The One.** (Bolding because this is important later.) M found a new love of his own, and we parted amicably. M and new love have been married 25 years and have grandchildren. We are still friends.\n\nEleven years into my relationship with B, along came J. He was a local radio personality and I was a fan. He was very charismatic and seemed like the sort of person I'd enjoy hanging out with (his wife, too), as friends. When we met in person at one of his meet-and-greets (his marriage was over by then), he went into full love-bombing, sweeping me off my feet, declaring that we had Something So Very Special Together. It wasn't long before I was thinking that I picked wrong when I picked B, and J was definitely The One.\n\n(Side note: I am autistic but grew up in a time when high-functioning autism/Asperger's was not recognized. I wasn't diagnosed until my 50s. I spent the first half of my life hearing, from parents, siblings, teachers and peers, \"WTF is WRONG with you?\" I was a sucker for anyone who not only didn't immediately see something wrong with me, but actively liked me ... or in the case of J, was -- or claimed to be -- over-the-top into me.)\n\nOf course, J was a narc with a capital N, but I didn't realize this at the time. When the love-bombing abruptly stopped, I spent the next year and a half trying to find the magic key that would make him love me the way he once did. Except of course, he never did. It was all lies. Took me a few more years to realize that.\n\nMercifully, my relationship with B survived all this. J cut me off before I could do anything drastic to B and me. The aftermath was painful and I spent that year and a half basically out of touch with reality, but B (bless him) stood by me. He still wonders if there will ever be another J to threaten our relationship. I have assured him there won't, and I mean it. That's because of the lessons I alluded to in the title of this post:\n\n(a) Narcs exist\n\n(b) If something/someone sounds too good to be true, it/he probably is\n\n(c) Just because another person sparks strong feelings doesn't mean I should throw away what I have.

It began with my sister confronting me to say that she knew of things that could get me in trouble with our parents, but that she wouldn\u2019t tell them if I did what she wanted.  Even though the \u201cbad\u201d things I had done were relatively minor (like taking all of the snacks, accidentally breaking something, etc.), I was an incredibly stupid kid and didn\u2019t want to get in trouble.  In exchange for not telling on me, my sister would make me kiss her, suck on her nipples, and eat her out.  This went on for 2 years, and I hated her and every moment of it, until she got a boyfriend and got bored of me. \n\nI have always had an awful relationship with my family, so I never brought it up to my parents.  My family was quite prominent and well-liked in the community, and I didn\u2019t see any good that could come from people knowing about it.  I\u2019ve never even discussed it with my sister now that we\u2019re both adults, and I don\u2019t think I have any desire to. \n\nNow that it\u2019s about 10 years later and I pretty much want nothing to do with my family, it\u2019s evident that this has effected my self esteem, sex life, and relationship with my sister.  I don\u2019t know how to move forward with this at all.  I don\u2019t know if I would ever want to pursue anything legally (or if I even could?), but I\u2019m not even sure who is to blame.  I feel so stupid and helpless for having let this happen to me, but I don\u2019t know that another course of action would have been any better.  Further, with my sister also being a minor when this occurred and my parents not being aware of the situation, can any of them be at fault? \n\nSorry for the rambling text of this post, and thank you to anyone who reads this and offers any advice or encouragement.  I\u2019m just tired of feeling so disgusted and helpless about my past.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

But I still live in fear that he will do something to me, as it has been almost a year and this person still wants to humiliate me on social media. I feel embarrassed and stupid that I put myself in such close proximity of him. He is clearly mentally ill and to me, someone who\u2019s dangerous.

I don\u2019t hear voices or see things (well maybe a few times right before I fall asleep, but it just sounds like loud thoughts that aren\u2019t mine, like people talking making no sense.) I feel hell from morning to night. It\u2019s a feeling I\u2019ve never felt before, an emotion I acquired around 7 months ago after I took acid for the last time. I was crying and hyperventilating in bed for hours and hours until  the trip finally went away. When I woke up I felt normal. I even smoked weed in the morning. It wasn\u2019t until two days after I woke up and nothing was the same ever again. I don\u2019t understand how it happened this way.\n\nI go into psychosis all the time. Almost every other day. Small things trigger me or it starts with no warning or reason. I cry and cry and talk to myself, or god begging it to end. The feeling inside of me, the hell I feel and no one will ever be able to understand how it feels. \n\nI began shock therapy and had around 20 sessions. In the end, half of my memory was gone. I can\u2019t remember teachers\u2019 names or kids that were in my class when I was in high school ( I had to drop out because I am so so sick in the head ). My friends drifted away, they didn\u2019t care or didn\u2019t want to see me this way. I only have my boyfriend.\n\nMy boyfriend would comfort me, but you see, I would cry, hyperventilate, and yell words in pain for hours. He couldn\u2019t put up with it. He would start to get mad and yell at me, calling me awful names, saying I\u2019m overreacting. He would be so mean to the point I would push him or shove him away, he said I hit him one time. I don\u2019t remember anything I wrote in this paragraph. These are his words and my assumptions based on the toxicity that is still happening. \n\nI cried when he told me I would put my hands on him. I would have never in a million years do that if I still had my right mind. I felt like it was my fault. \n\nI still hysterically sob all the time to the point I would wake everyone in my house up (these episodes happen most the time at night). I had the longest episode I ever had, after around a hour of my boyfriend comforting me, he grabbed my face and stared to shake it. I yelled and begged him to stop. I told him he was hurting me, and then he said he was going to hurt me worse if I didn\u2019t stop crying. His voice was so scary. I laid in bed begging him not to hurt me. I was in hell.\n\nI stopped crying. I just laid there in shock. He took credit for ending my episode. I wish I kept crying. \n\nI called him crazy, a lunatic, I really think he is one.  He later apologized and said he lost his temper and it won\u2019t happen again. \n\nLiar.\n\nLast night, me and him got in a small argument. I don\u2019t even remember what it was about. He called me a stupid bitch. I just left the room and went to sit on the couch that was on his back porch. I wanted to be alone. He soon followed me to where I was, telling me I needed to go back into his room because I was having an episode and shouldn\u2019t be alone. \n\nI wasn\u2019t in an episode, I felt sane, I wasn\u2019t even that mad, just mad. I told him I wanted to be alone. He grabbed at my hand that was holding my phone. We played tug of war with in for 10 seconds until my hand started to hurt really bad, so I let go. He told me I would get my phone back if I went back to his room. \n\nI followed him back to his room and I stood at the door demanding he gives me my phone back. I told him he has no control over me and can\u2019t manipulate me to do what I want. I explained I just really wanted to be alone right now. He wouldn\u2019t give it back so I just went to the back porch and sat without it. \n\nFucking lunatic followed me back to the back porch and started to grab me, tried to grab me to pull me back to his room. I latched my grip onto the couch and yelled for him to let me go. My knees were being torn up and his grip was so harsh. I cried in pain. I kicked him away from me and sat back down on the couch. I wasn\u2019t going to give in even if it was the easier choice. I wanted to prove I owe him nothing. \n\nHe sat down and began to hold me, I expressed my disliking and begged for him not to touch me. He pinned me down and started asking over and over again why I hated him, why I hated him after all he has done for me. After all the hell I put him through almost every night. He told me he doesn\u2019t enjoy it at all, that it tears him apart on the inside. That it kills him he can\u2019t make me stop screaming and crying.\n\nI just kept saying I wanted to be alone, begging for him to get off of me. He tries to pick me up again after a long session of him begging me to tell him why I hate him. I hit him on the back a few time, then he threw me on the couch, grabbed me harshly by the hands and just tries to drag me again, I keep kicking him. \n\nHe hit me in the fucking face. It hurt so bad\n\nI began to sob. I said over and over again that I want out, I want out so so bad, that I\u2019m tired. I called him a freak. A fucking sick fuck.\n\nI went and laid down in his grandparent\u2019s room, who is out of town. He laid in there with me. I lost my will to fight. He apologized and said he was in the wrong, but he insisted I was in the wrong too because he needed me, like I needed him almost every night. He was meeting with his patrol officer in the morning and was kinda emotional about it, and he needed comfort. But I wanted to be left alone.\n\nWe had sex that night, I finally held him while still feeling broken on the inside.\n \nI lay with his arm rapped around me as I type this. He is making cute noises in my sleep. My heart still melts for him. \n\nI have no where to run. I have no where I would rather run.

I refuse to let her alienate him again.\n\nShe first started to isolate him from his friends and family over a decade ago and either she got board or he managed to get out 2 years ago after spending at least a year sleeping on their sofa while she was on tinder all the time, him working, plus doing the chores and childcare.\n\nIt's not even that long ago he was telling me about how controlling and how lazy she is, so although I knew she was possibly abusive, I didn't make the connection about the narcissism and how much control she would still be able to have. \nAnd, I even saw first hand some of the things she did as we were all friends. Just put it down to them having some sort of open relationship or her looking out for his best interests when they had split up and she was splitting him up from other women.\n\nI thought it would be good for the kids if they saw two parents getting on even though they weren't together so I was trying to be supportive of what I thought was going to be them being able to be civil and maybe friends.

This was the day after he left me. I did tell them about him leaving me as soon as it happened as I am close to them so perhaps I have made all of this worse. \n\nUp until a couple of months ago, he talked about finally sorting the divorce out. In the UK at the moment you only have to pay the court costs for a divorce if you've been separated for at least two consecutive years. I wonder if thats what precipitated the nex wanting him again, or the fact he was back to his old happy self. I've known him for nearly 20 years, her for the time they have been together. It's only been a week but it feels like a lifetime. I know he's lost weight, I have too. I've had to come off social media because she's posting lots about them and she even sent me a message saying she wanted us to be friends still.

I have been on and off with my Nex for about two years. I had gone almost one month NC after being discarded and ignored for what i assume to be another girl. He texted me yesterday saying \"Hello\". My heart started pounding and i thought i was going to puke. (Im sure you all know this feeling) I had so much anxiety. I had planned what i would say to him if he ever came back. I have been mentally preparing myself for this day since we last spoke. \n\nPart of my learning and coping was reading posts you guys share about your own personal experiences. The last time my Nex and I were seeing each other he was messaging one of my friends (of 12 years) behind my back. Of course she sent me screen shots and she never responded to him. \n\nSo my response to him after his pathetic \"Hello\" text was a screen shot of what he had sent her. I followed my screenshot with an \"lol fuck off\". He responded back with \"what a narc\". I didn't respond after this and i **NEVER** plan to again. I did want him to know that i can see through him and that hes a POS. I went from being confident and carefree to depressed and self conscious with him in my life. But today I feel free again, calm, and ready to live my life. I could never wish this upon my worst enemy. Manipulation from someone you think loves you and has your best interests in mind is horrible. My friends have been a huge support system to me. \n\nThis is my first post and i just wanted to say to anyone struggling that it **DOES** get better.

{"post_id": "cb7i4s", "created_utc": 1562709277, "title": "Divorcing a covert narcissist", "author": "divorcinganarc", "self_text": "I\u2019m going through a divorce with my wife right now, who I suspect is a covert narcissist. I was with her for 9 years total, and nearly the whole time felt amazing. She was always very sweet and loving, our sex life was always great, and I was dissatisfied with absolutely nothing. And neither was she, so it seemed, until recently.\n\nIt\u2019s been a very tough time, as there was some emotional infidelity (a crazy story in and of itself) that led to my recognition of some of her narcissistic traits. The idealization/devaluation/discard cycle became completely evident\u2014not only in our relationship, but also looking back at how she described some of her previous relationships. There was also triangulation at least 2-3 other times, though never fully acted upon until now, along with gaslighting and a shocking lack of empathy for what I\u2019ve been going through as she fell in love with someone else and the devaluation began.\n\nAt the end of May, she told me reassuringly (as we had been arguing about some of her emotional infidelity) how much she loved our relationship and being my wife. One week later, she wanted a divorce. This sudden discard was one of the most painful things I\u2019ve experienced. She grew up with a narcissistic father, and she has always been aware of her possible \u201cfleas\u201d (narcissistic behavior resulting from her family dynamic), but she refuses to acknowledge them in this case. It is all about her and her journey; she recognizes that I am in pain but feels no regret. She becomes incredibly defensive when I bring up what I recognize as narcissism\u2014it\u2019s pointless, so I don\u2019t even talk about it anymore. What\u2019s interesting is that her mother completely recognizes it, given her prior experience, and is not supportive of her decisions. She\u2019s actually been very supportive to me during this time, because she can relate to what I am going through.\n\nMy wife says she needs time alone to find herself, but in reality, she just wants time with this new person. It is a long-distance relationship and they have never even met\u2014but I recognize the love-bombing and obsessiveness that she has with this person, because it was the same thing I received in the beginning. It is clear to me that her plan is to move on to this new supply, and that this is why she wants to leave me. She will give a variety of other reasons\u2014our codependency, getting bored, wanting more independence, etc.\u2014but they are all secondary reasons or excuses.\n\nShe does recognize her false self and talks of being more \u201cauthentic\u201d now. What this really means is no longer keeping up appearances, no longer maintaining that facade. She claims to have not even known it was a facade, that everything was truthful to her at the time, but I don\u2019t trust her anymore after all of the gaslighting. I\u2019ll never know what was true or what was false, but I know it would be a waste of time to try and figure that out.\n\nI\u2019m not fighting it any longer. I\u2019ve accepted this reality and I\u2019m actually beginning to look forward to new possibilities. The divorce is going surprisingly well\u2014I\u2019m keeping the house, our dog, money has been divided 50/50, and we have no kids. It will be tough financially for a while, but at least I can keep my life intact and not have to make any other major changes.\n\nPart of the reason it\u2019s going well is because I know the game now, and I\u2019m just going to play it. I *could* address her narcissistic tendencies every day, but I choose to let it slide because I don\u2019t need the conflict and she won\u2019t change. She can have her space, she can talk to her new boyfriend, and do whatever she wants. Since I\u2019m agreeing to let go, she has been agreeable with me, so at least that has been nice.\n\nWe haven\u2019t stopped having sex; in fact, she wants it more than ever now. I joined up with some dating apps this past weekend and told her about it\u2014and we\u2019ve had sex about 5 times since (after about a 3 week drought). Also, a lot more kissing and physical affection (we totally don\u2019t look like a divorcing couple). It\u2019s just interesting to observe this behavior now that I\u2019m aware of it. Again, I\u2019m playing the game. I know she\u2019s doing this with me as a way to maintain control of my supply, as a way to keep me around. And I don\u2019t care anymore; I can see through it for what it is, and just accept it. For now, I need that, even if there is something false about it. It makes this process easier if I still have something to offer her. At least at this moment, she is not demanding very much from the divorce, and if I can get out during this \u201cin limbo\u201d devaluation stage rather than after a bitter, angry \u201cfinal\u201c discard, then I\u2019ll still be okay.\n\nShe moves out next month. I\u2019m ready to go no contact, but it will be very hard. We were best friends\u2014we still manage to have good conversations and joke around with each other\u2014and I know she\u2019ll probably still try to seduce me or be affectionate with me after the divorce. I don\u2019t know if I will be able to resist sex, because I probably won\u2019t be getting it anywhere else for a while. I recognize that this could potentially keep me from a new relationship. If I allowed it, she\u2019d probably always be in the background of my life, coming back to seduce me whenever it is fitting for her. Despite what I know is true, and I know what I\u2019m supposed to do, I am still in love with her and find her irresistible; I can\u2019t help it. She is a siren; she could shipwreck me all over again and I would enjoy it until the very end. Can anyone else relate? Would you do it all over again? True or false, the good times felt so good that I\u2019m not ready to say I wouldn\u2019t.\n\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It has been really painful in so many ways. Dealing with rejection, the feeling of abandonment, sadness, inadequacy\u2026 the list goes on. I am reaching out to the reddit community for the first time because I just really need additional support. I feel as if I have exhausted my friends and family, and have recently started going to a therapist, which has helped, but also feels like I have opened up Pandora\u2019s Box.\n\nMy ex and I met at work years ago. He was 8 years older than me, and it always bothered him that we had such a large age gap. I felt so lucky to have found an \u201cadult\u201d to be with- he was about to graduate as an elementary school teacher, had similar hobbies to mine, had a seemingly good relationship with his family, and was handsome and smart. My previous boyfriend was an addict and that put me through so much, I was happy to have found a well-adjusted individual.\n\nHowever, as our relationship progressed, there were many red flags that I chose to ignore, which then turned into actual problems. Almost every fight we got into, he started and finished, barely, if ever, allowing me to speak my truth. I was constantly belittled for being younger than him, making less money and not having a career (I am in nursing school and work 2 jobs), and being called lazy because I don\u2019t work full time. His favorite terms to label me with were \u201cbitch,\u201d \u201cslut,\u201d \u201cstupid,\u201d \u201cidiot,\u201d \u201cwhore,\u201d \u201ccunt\u201d and many more I don\u2019t have the heart to type out. To me, most of the fights he picked were over things that felt like they shouldn\u2019t be fought about, but to him, I was being disrespectful of his feelings for not wanting to fight. I would literally beg him not to cuss me out, call me these names, or treat me poorly. He told me over and over that I \u201cbrought it out in him \u201dand that he \u201chas never treated another girl like this before me\u2026\u201d It really makes me feel awful thinking back on all of this.\n\nHe never really got physical with me, he did push me to the ground once, spit in my face once, and threaten me by saying \u201cI really want to beat the shit out of you right now.\u201d\n\nI was blamed for his apartment being messy, told I didn\u2019t contribute enough, blamed for him being broke even though he spends over $200 a month on weed and never took me out on dates (which is fine, I do not expect any boyfriend to always pay for every date.. he just never paid for one as time went on).\n\nI was rarely complimented. He told me early on he didn\u2019t use the word \u201cbeautiful\u201d often because then it would \u201close its meaning\u201d so I think I was called beautiful just once. Cute sometimes. However, I was called nasty things all of the time. The things he called me replay over and over in my head every day. Just when I start to feel a little confident, I think about what he said and lose it all. I am embarrassed that I put up with this for so long, but I still find myself missing him, which makes me feel even more pathetic.\n\nEarly on, I once caught him texting another woman, asking if she would want to go out dancing and then get a room. It really hurt that he was seeking out another woman but hurt even more that he was wanting to do these things with her he never did with me.\n\nWe once had a fight where I was cussed out and screamed at because I couldn\u2019t navigate home for him, because my phone was dead. Another fight was when he lost our train tickets after a football game. It was my fault because I asked him to hold them. That night was the night he spit on me, pushed me to the ground, and got the police called because he was getting so loud with his insults.\n\nThis is all just scratching the surface\u2026 I am afraid to call it abuse because I feel like others have had it so much worse, and once the label is there.. I am a victim.\n\nReddit- I am just seeking out support. I feel so down about myself\u2026 that I let this happen\u2026 that I still miss him\u2026 that he is the one who ended things and not me\u2026 that apparently, I brought this out in him.\n\nNow, he claims he is working on himself, exercising, wanting to have new hobbies, etc. Why didn\u2019t he want to do this with me?\n\nThanks for any reply or support offered.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Then one evening I notice my number is suddenly blocked again. Wtf? A friend of mine allowed me the use of their phone to see what the deal was. This narcissistic asshole admits to blocking my number because he started talking to his ex (another source of supply) and he \"wanted to do right by her\" so yeah he was basically going to drop me and not say a word...such a chickenshit. The best part is when he started demanding to know who's phone I was using. I refused to tell him, then he said that I had 5 seconds to tell him the name or we would never speak again. He actually started counting \"5...4...*click* I hung up on him. I later got a message saying \"You are incapable of being honest with me.

I left my ex narc husband a little over two years ago and we're finally divorced. I wanted to share my story in hopes it will offer some positivity to others going through the legal system with their narc. Some things I've changed because my situation is mildy known in my neck of the woods. \n\nMarried 8 years, two very young children. Narc cheated for the last time on me so I kicked him out of the house. The next several weeks were filled with pure terror. Threats of violence, tried to abduct our children, broke into our family home in the middle of the night, guns being waved around constantly ... Ya know, the lifetime movie type of stuff. Ended with him being arrested for shooting with intent to kill. Yup, he tried to kill us. In those few weeks of escalating violence I remember thinking to myself, it's either going to be me or him. And I've got kids to raise. I received a full no contact order and documented every situation and called the police to file reports any time I could. Because when he killed me, I wanted to make sure the police absolutely knew who did it. \n\nHe ended up getting a slap on the wrist for his crimes. A small amount of time to be served, some probation. I filed for divorce a month after he was initially charged with his crime. It's been two years. Two years. I was granted my divorce today. Everything I wanted and some things I hadn't requested. I have full custody of our children, a life long protective order, all of the property, etc. It was a win for me. \n\nHe is currently in jail serving out his small sentence and was brought into the divorce courtroom for our merit trial. He acted his complete and entire ass. He wouldn't stop talking. Calling me names. Accusing me of whatever he could think of. At one point told he told the judge he shouldn't be responsible for the debt on a store card at a lingerie store in our name because I never looked good it any of it. Actually testified, against the advice of his attorney, that I had a PO against him for 2 years and why should they extend it? Nothing has happened in two years. (You could hear the eye rolls in the court room) Per the advice of my attorney, I didn't speak at all during our merit trial which felt both empowering and not. I had to stop myself several times for standing up and shreeking \"fuckkkkk you\". But it was a shit show. It worked out for me and my children in the end but two years of no contact later he's still trying his hardest to get to me. He had nothing to loose so he went for it, at full speed. His attorney even gave me a hug at the end of it all and wished the children and I a lifetime of happiness. \n\nIcing on the cake? He called me from jail tonight and violated the life long no contact protective order he promised to uphold 10 hours earlier. The calls to report the PO violation and to make sure the jail blocked him from calling me felt like I took my power back a little more. I am putting my foot down, fuck off forever. We're divorced. Finally.\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone for the kind words. I've received several messages about how everything was handled legally. So, I wanted to add that my legal team was provided by my local domestic violence center. I have met some amazing people who have put their heart and soul into assisting me legally. These wonderful people led the way for me, held my hand when I needed it, cried with me and most importantly bulldozed through the legal system with my children and my best interests in mind. They advocated for me in ways I never thought about and one time took over a judges chamber to ensure the ex at least served SOME time. The legal system has been unkind to me as a \"victim\" but the team worked constantly to make sure it worked out the best it could. If you have access to these services and have been involved in domestic violence, I highly recommend utilizing them. I've formed life long bonds with these awesome people and it's been a comfort to know I'm not alone.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We had been friends for years before dating and he struggled with some mental health issues so I always felt very protective over him. He told me the breakup was due to it being a long distance relationship and that his career was too stressful to juggle both, but I was special to him and we would always be best friends. We never really stopped talking to each other after the break up and it didn\u2019t seem like much had changed other than the fact that we had no plans to see each other. We were both even still exchanging \u201cI love you\u201d\u2019s.  And then suddenly I see him on Instagram out for dinner with a new girl and I got very upset. He told me I was being crazy and that it was just a casual date. A week later I told him I had plans to meet up with a guy I knew from school and he replies back with \u201cI\u2019ve already f*cked 3 girls\u201d which obviously he was using to upset me. I went for dinner with the guy and felt like maybe if I did something I wouldn\u2019t feel so bad about him moving on. One thing lead to another and we ended up hooking up but I stopped it before it got to sex. I quickly left his apartment feeling so guilty. My ex asked me how the date went and I was honest with him and told him how upset I was about the whole situation and how sorry I was. He exploded and told me he hated me, called me a slut and a whore, and even went as far as telling me to kill my self. I felt guilty even though I knew his reaction and words were unwarranted. \n\nHe basically gave me the ultimatum of flying out to see him or he was completely blocking me from his life. At the time I felt so guilty I immediately booked a flight out to see him for a weekend. The weekend I was there he was so kind to me and we really enjoyed each other\u2019s company but at the end of it he reiterated to me that he \u201cneeded to work on himself\u201d and couldn\u2019t be in a relationship. I returned home still feeling sad but comforted my the fact that we were still friends. For the next month after that he was back to telling me he loved me and we had a \u201cspecial bond\u201d I asked him to stop multiple times since it made moving on a lot more difficult for me. Then all of the sudden this SAME GIRL is back on his Instagram. I bring it up calmly and say that I feel like he had been lying to me about her. He told me I\u2019m crazy and that I needed to move on from him, again it was nothing serious she just happened to be in town. \n\nOver the last two weeks things were calm. I finally felt like we were in a place of just being friends even tho he was still throwing around \u201cI love you\u201d when I would ask him to stop. He mentioned to me that the same girl was coming to visit him in a few weeks. I still felt confused by it all but decided I wouldn\u2019t let it bother me, we were just friends. I went on a date with a guy I met on hinge and my ex and I were even joking around about it. Out of nowhere last Friday he sent me a video of him touching himself saying he was thinking of me and I\u2019m like \u201cwtf please don\u2019t do things like this anymore it\u2019s crossing a line\u201d he brushed it off as joking around as friends.  Then the next day he suddenly snaps on me about my date saying how much it hurt him that I was being so accommodating to random guys when he had to work so hard to get me, that I would never find someone as good as him. He said such disgusting things to me to the point where I had to block him. I was in tears and he FaceTimed me and just stared at me crying with a grin on his face. It was evil. \n\nLiterally a day later I find out he\u2019s in Vegas with this girl and at the point I couldn\u2019t even be upset. I just felt like I was free of it all and it was time to really move on.  He sent me the odd message throughout the week that I didn\u2019t respond to. Today I was feeling a bit down and I missed him so I texted asking how he was doing. He replied back saying that he was good and that he couldn\u2019t talk to me anymore out of respect for this new girl. He told me that he had a very calm week and was glad I didn\u2019t talk to him. It helped him realize that I was toxic for him. I felt so angry. I expressed how I felt so manipulated and dragged along for 3 months. He was literally saying I love you and sending me his dick a week ago and suddenly he has a new gf. We now have each other blocked on all platforms and I feel a sense of relief but am still in shock about this entire situation.\n\nLooking back on our relationship as a whole there was definitely a ton of red flags. Any time I would get the slightest bit upset he would tell me to go find a new boyfriend and that I\u2019d never do as good as him. He would constantly tell me I was too thin, too awkward, my boobs were too small \u201cbut I love you anyways\u201d.

I was very young at the time (beginning in early childhood, up until age 8) and any memories of what he has done to me are either long gone or suppressed out of existance. Most if not all my knowledge of the events comes from records of red flags kept by my mom, most coming from my brother, there were a few instances where I said or did something concerning, one example being me telling my mom there was a new kid at school and he had touched me in the school showers. Only problem was I was in preschool, and the school had no showers. After finding out about all this I slowly began making connections in my head, sometimes my dad would offer to give me a sponge bath for no apparent reason, my young mind saw nothing wrong with this and allowed him to wash me down, privates and all. Another thing he had was this game called \"tickle monster\" which seems innocent enough on the surface but I'm almost certain it was used to get his hands lower than they were supposed to be.\nWhat I'm leading up to here is going to sound really strange and you might think I'm joking, but I mean this with 100% certainty. One night fairly recently I was on the toilet taking a dump. Now historically my excitement has always been hard, rough, and painful, but something about the one that night, the feeling of stress it put on the rectal muscles gave me extreme anxiety, to the point where I was physically shaking. I don't know if that has something to do with it giving me flashbacks to the rape, but it set off something deep inside me. I mentioned it to my mother, she suspected it was linked to the abuse, and we moved on. I bring this up because tonight it happened again, but this time the shaking was much worse, it's been going on for at least 30 minutes now, every time I stand my legs shake and I have to basically lock my knees in place to even stand still, accompanied by an unexplainable feeling of just wrong.

She  goes to brush her teeth, wash her face, put on pajamas, etc. Meanwhile, I am expected to clean up the living room, organize the clothes all over her room, make her bed (a very specific process) and then sit while she finishes her work. Any deviation from this formula leads to arguing with the threat of breaking up.\n\nWhen she finally comes to bed, I massage her, and then I lay there, doing nothing (because if I were to do anything but sit still and breathe quietly I would \"bother\" her), until she falls asleep.

Things I don\u2019t think I could tell anyone, family or otherwise. So I thought why not just post it here? \n\nWhen I was 8 my parents divorced. Of course it was for the better (I see that now) my father was an abusive drug addict. I had to move to a different state where I stayed with my aunt for a time while my mom sold the house and everything we owned so we could start all over. My female cousin who was 4 years old then me, (let\u2019s call her A) used to play these games with me- this usually involved nudity, kissing  and touching. At the time I didn\u2019t know what we were doing was wrong, but looking back at it now it\u2019s clear she was abused by someone sexually. She\u2019d always tell me to keep these games secret and to never tell anyone because then we couldn\u2019t play together. \n\nIn my adolescent mind she was the cool older cousin and my only friend. I didn\u2019t want to lose the only friend I had, especially since I\u2019d left behind everyone I\u2019d ever known. I was alone without her and that was terrifying to me. This continued for nearly a year before my mom was finally able to rejoin me. I never told her was she was doing to me. \n\nWe moved into my great aunts house in very questionable neighborhood by any standards but she\u2019d own the since the early 60\u2019s and she was the closest relative we had that wasn\u2019t too far from my new school. My mom did the best she could spending most of her time working to save money and support me. It got to the point where I only saw her on nights where I stayed up as late as I could to catch brief moments with her. Every time she\u2019d tell me how much she loved me and how she wanted to spend more time with me but couldn\u2019t. \n\nShe was so open with me about the situation we were in and I did my best to understand... I so I did what I thought I would make my mom happy. I tried to make friends with neighbors.. this lead me to my second abuser. A girl I\u2019ll just call B. \n\nB unlike A was much older than me. She was about 15,   At first I didn\u2019t really interact with her so much as her younger brother who was my age. Soon enough though I caught her attention. Soon she\u2019d began to corner me. Usually on the roof top of my home. Florida has these sort of [shoe box shaped houses ](https://www.picclickimg.com/d/w1600/pict/183765979329_/Vintage-Postcard-Florida-Sun-Deck-Homes-Advertising-Hialeah.jpg) the further south you go, the one I stayed in had a steep ladder to the \u201csun deck\u201d. They were  built for convince, and quick production time. Right there on the roof in the sweltering summer heat- she force me strip my underwear off and tell me to touch myself. At this point I knew something was wrong. She wasn\u2019t my cousin there for I couldn\u2019t do those \u201cspecial\u201d things with her- after all I could only do that with family. \n\nWhen I tried to say no or leave she\u2019d start hurt herself like legitimately hurt herself. Pinching bits of skin till she bleed, scratching her face to leave marks, then warn me if I didn\u2019t do what she wanted she\u2019d tell my mom or my great aunt that I did this to her. I was so scared I\u2019d get in trouble and add to my mom stress. I just let it happen every day. I\u2019d be forced to go to her family parties, birthdays, you name it, despite begging my aunty to stay home. \n\nSchool was no better for me. I was heavily bullied. I was fat, dreadfully under socialized, and looked racially different than most kids. It got worse when I was finally diagnosed with a learning disability and placed in a special ed classes . (I was illiterate, and struggled with basic math until late 4th grade and was held back.)  The teachers just sort of watched, expect for my p.e teacher that would openly criticize my being fat. He openly remark about how ugly I was because of it and that I\u2019d never get a boy to like me the way I was... I just remembered one night I was just balling, and didn\u2019t leave my room or eat over the weekend. My mom pulled aside and asked what had happened. Through tears I explained the bullying and the comments my teacher made. \n\nReasonably she transferred me another school a bit farther away. After a long summer with continued roof top torture sessions that gave B hours and hours of unsupervised time to do what she wanted. I started to become angry... angry at the world. Why did I deserve this? Why was it no matter what I did it got the same result. People walking all over me, hurting me. What had I done? So I made up my mind and refused to let anyone take advantage of me. I wasn\u2019t a bully, I never targeted or tormented anyone, but if you tried to insult me or touch me I snapped. Whatever friends I had just manipulated me to make me protect them from what ever consequences they\u2019d get for teasing or pushing other students around. \n\nI was easily blinded by simple kindness. When middle school came around me and my mom finally moved into a rented home of our own. The best apart besides having my own room was that I never had to see B again. Middle school... was rough. It was mostly the same group of kids I\u2019d already known and had a reputation for being dumb and fighting. My behavior only escalated and soon I was pushing away most everyone. I had small group of friend that were all sorts of f-cked up in their own way. I guess we just sorta gravitate to each other. I ended up exploring a lot of my sexuality and identity  at way too early age and was utterly confused.  At one point I was convinced I was a boy, because it was the only way I could explain my attraction to girls. This was when I started to self harm. I kept it hidden for years. \n\nI dated a very closeted girl for a long time. She was my best friend regardless of my \u201cexploits\u201d.  \n\nWhat few people do know is what happen in high school. I became depressed, and angry. It felt like I had no control over myself or my life. The fights that started when in middle school with my mom only got worse. We were constantly butting heads and things progressed to actually fighting. She started to verbally abuse me constantly. Every day it was things like \u201cyou\u2019re so f-cking worthless, I can\u2019t believe your my mine. No daughter of mine can be retarded.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a stupid f-cking whore and you\u2019ll end up just like your loser sperm donor.\u201dect.  \n\nWhen eventually I was 17- my mom finally saw my body- she\u2019d happen to catch me changing one day. She was angrier with me then she\u2019d ever been (close second to when she found out I was dating a girl). I always just blamed it on being bullied and never told her about the sexual abuse. The worse part is I think there are more instances of abuse with some family members that I\u2019ve simply just blocked from memory... there are certain people in my family that make me sick to be around regardless of the fact that I don\u2019t think we had history. \n\nIt\u2019s been many years since all of this. My relationship with my mom has improved. I\u2019ve been sober for 4 years and stopped self harming for 6. The need to compulsively lie stopped when I started to see  that I didn\u2019t need to make up a persona to make people like me. Turns out I\u2019m pretty rad artist, kinda funny to some and not as dumb as I used to think. Not too long a ago I ended a very toxic 7 year relationship with that once best friend. Me and A don\u2019t mention what happen but now support each other emotionally like sisters. Continued therapy and self betterment. I\u2019m no longer suicidal. I\u2019m still learning... I\u2019ve slipped up every now and then. But every day I\u2019m trying to be better. My situation has improve though new issues have arrived as life does... I may not always deal with it perfectly but I try... \n\nStill even now I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s enough. I messed up recently and am currently paying the price. It feels like rock bottom but I\u2019m trying to be positive in my own way I guess. \n\nIf you took the time to read this long as heck post. Thank you. For all of you who are in currently in a shitty place, know that there\u2019s always someone out there to help. You matter and your feelings are valid. Seek out help, I know it\u2019s scary but if I would\u2019ve known then what I know now, I would have gotten help much much sooner- maybe things would have been different.

I say possibly because she's not a full blown narcissist, but she shows some signs of it and I show the signs of a victim. OR, I might be the one causing this weird dynamic. I'd like to ask what you all think.\n\nOur relationship is based on mostly texting, as we don't hang out at school. She ignores nearly all of my texts. She's blatant about it too. For example, she ignores my texts until she needs to talk to me, and she sends the REPLY and WHAT SHE NEEDS TO SAY at the same time. For example, if I ask \"What's your favorite animal?\", she replies a day later \"Dogs. By the way, I met this cute guy today\".\n\nThis just demoralizes me. I feel both anger and sadness. She does this every time, but I'm too afraid to address it. This literally gives me intense anxiety.\n\nI try to \"win her heart\" by literally listening to her problems for hours. It makes me feel rewarded and gives me an adrenaline rush every time I see a text back.\n\nWhen she DOES (rarely) seem to care for me, I forget about the pain she's caused me and decide that \"maybe I was just overreacting\" or \"maybe she changed and will start treating me better from now on\". It's a trap I've fallen for so many times, yet I become so hopeful every time.\n\nShe told me that I'm her best friend (which gave me so much pride and happiness), and I consider herself to be mine too DESPITE having other friends who genuinely care about me.\n\nShe goes out of her way to hide the fact that I'm her closest friend. It's seriously demoralizing.\n\nI find myself apologizing for the smallest things. I know it's insane, but apologizing also gives me that adrenaline rush.\n\nShe never apologizes. We had an argument where we were both in the wrong, and a very rational and logical friend suggested that I apologize, knowing that she'd apologize too. I and this friend were surprised when my apology was met with an angry \"Don't do it again\". This single incident led me to never escalate arguments and always apologize even when I'm not in the wrong. Any raise in the tone of her texts fills me with terror and anxiety. I'm paranoid about her somehow finding this post even though she doesn't use reddit.\n\nShe has no issue demanding things from me. Obviously, it's not extreme and blatant, but it's not sweet either. She tells me to do things rather than asking (\"Send me all the pictures you have of...\"). I always oblige, because again, anxiety from not complying, and the adrenaline from doing so.\n\nIt fills me with adrenaline when she signals that I made her feel better. I love complimenting her looks and consoling her about her crushes.\n\nI've always blamed myself for being too needy, annoying, creepy, and mentally unstable that makes her treat me like this. But familiarizing myself with narcissism made me consider if I could possibly be the victim.\n\nI'm sorry for littering my thoughts everywhere but I'm very tired and emotional writing this post. My thoughts might not be coherent. Thank you so so so much for reading. I know this post is long\n\nDoes she sound like a narcissist? Also, WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME. Why am I obsessing over pleasing her and winning her over? This has been a huge source of anxiety and stress for many years, yet it's also made me excited and chasing it as if it were a drug.

Taking everything positive I had and turning into a negative. My mother was supportive of me exercising? He would say maybe she thinks your fat and chuckle. I would say that hurt and he apologised. But something about it I couldn't let go. The way he said it with such conviction.\n\nWhen he'd mock my family's accent and call me stupid for leaving my phone behind. I'd blow up at him later and then feel such guilt, that I didn't deserve such a lovely boy like him. Telling me that I eat too slow, asking why I wear such colourful clothes. He'd blow up at me, if I didn't ask how his day was straight away after he asked me.\n\nBut then I'd withdraw, out of fear. Wouldn't talk to him as much. Give him slow replies. I hate that I did that.\n\nWhen I was hurt about his jokes about suicide and ask him not to say them anymore, he'd stop. Then say it again to look at my response. When we'd argue, and told him that what he said was offensive to my heritage and culture. He'd look at me and repeat what he said and smirked. When I asked what was wrong, he'd laugh and changed the subject to his past so that I'd drop it.\n\nHe was allowed to make comments and offhanded jokes about my culture, but as soon as I made the smallest comment he told me I was not allowed to do it because \"I was not apart of the culture.\" Even when we weren't arguing, he told me to \"go back to where I came from\" with a smirk. And I blew up. Told him that I had a British passport.\n\nI would tell him that I was having doubts, and that we needed to talk. I tried. To talk to him and understand where he was coming from. He just would attack me for having those thoughts and doubts. The final straw was when he swore at me in public for eating my pasta too slow, and I apologised. And so did he. Then he flicked my face repeatedly in public.\n\nI told him I was unhappy and cried. So much. He held me. And I really liked that. He told me how I am \"lovely\" and how he \"isn't.\" He tried to change the subject by telling me how his father treated him, I was horrified and I wanted to help but I knew it would be the death of me. I told him to give me space, and that we could be friends if we didn't talk for a while. We broke up.\n\nThe next morning. He sent me a message. Saying how beautiful I am, saying how he hates himself, explaining all the arguments to me and how everytime I asked him what was wrong that something was up. He wanted me back. Promised that he would change. And then I felt anger, like I've never felt before. I felt crazy, unhinged the whole duration of our time together. What was true? What was reality anymore? I felt pity and wanted to take him back in an instant. But I knew that I wouldn't survive this time round. I thanked him, and told him that I needed time and space to think about the next step, both of our exams were on the horizon and I just couldn't self-sabotage our education. It was wrong, I know. It was an escape, survival technique.\n\nWe didn't talk for 3 weeks. I didn't talk to him. I unfollowed him on Facebook, as he was posting quite a bit. I posted too, I'm not sure whether it was to prove something or not. I cried so much. I would walk past our hang out places to feel something. My life became numb. When we talked again I was ready to give a full reply, but it was too late. Our conversation was brief, but provided closure. He broke up with me this time, but I agreed that it was for the best.\n\nSometimes I'd see him on the bus, and my whole being was on fire. I'd slink away, with my heart racing and feeling breathless. I wanted and needed to escape. I slowly started feeling okay again.\n\nBut then I made so many mistakes after I saw him and talked to him again once. Just that one time.\n\nI would spend hours on his Twitter, hoping to see an update. I accidently liked his tweet and he deactivated his account.   I wanted to show him. Show him that I had thrived, prove to him that this relationship hadn't broken me in anyway. But another part of me was so desperate. Desperate to get him back, in anyway possible. So I'd hang around places he might be at, just to catch a glimpse. On his birthday weekend, I walked past his bus stop on two occasions. And I think I saw him on both those occasions. I would hang around at places he'd frequent. I don't know why. Paradoxically, everytime I see him after this, I don't feel hunger. Now I'm **that** psycho ex. And I'm so scared. Scared because stonewalling, stalking and all these hoovering techniques. Aren't they signs of me being the Narcissist? Am I abusive? I can't stop crying, my head is pounding and my sense of peace that I had before him has been erased. I hate this. I don't know what to believe anymore.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

TW: death mention (brief)", "author": "Maera420", "self_text": "TW: very brief mention of death\n\nEdit before posting: This got so much longer than intended. Thank you to anyone and everyone who makes it through the entire thing.\n\nTL;DR is essentially what is the best way you've found to help someone who just doesn't \"get it\" (\"it\" being your emotions, triggers, abuse, etc., anything relating to your abuse pretty much) understand you/your trauma and responses better?? They'll never get it the same way that another person who has been abused will, but is there any way you've been able to effectively help someone in your life understand it all just that little bit more??\n\nIs it even possible to get someone else, who never grew up with abuse (or at least a far more minimal version of it), to understand what we're going through???\n\nI've been with my SO for nearly 2 years now. I love him, and he adores me, but he just...doesn't get it. No matter how many times I've tried to explain it, he doesn't really understand why I feel or react the way I do in triggering situations, what could end up being a triggering situation for me, why I'm okay with something once but not the next time.\n\nHe didn't have the greatest parents growing up, and he definitely has some behaviours that came about because of his childhood, but his dad did try for him and his brothers. His mom died when he was 18 (he's 28 in a couple months), and from what I understand, the only thing that got worse upon her death was their financial situation. She was neglectful, and that entire family has very few good things to say about her. So, good childhood, not-so-good/crappy parent(s), but not really any abuse aside from the maternal neglect by his own admission.\n\nI had to convince him that my mom popping my zits was physical abuse and genuinely scarred me emotionally. He wasn't trying to be an ass about it, but any of his friends who were physically abused as kids were like shoved down stairs or the like. My mom popping my zits just didn't seem that bad to him. It seemed like something I should have just been able to say no to, or fight back. I spent several days before I managed to convince him that just because it was a much more minor form, doesn't mean it wasn't physical abuse, and that telling me I should have fought back (when I DID) was just about the furthest from saying something useful he could get. That is genuinely better now between us.\n\nHe just really doesn't seem to get it, no matter how hard I try to explain the various emotions/reactions/etc. that are related to my past abuse, and how that past abuse has shaped me. He does try to understand, I think. But I've had abused friends, and they just get it, instantly. I barely have to explain myself. Having to explain myself, or educate him, feels...weird. Kinda bad for some reason, if I'm honest. Not really sure why..\n\nI know he'll never understand it as well as another victim will, but is there anything you have found helpful when trying to explain how your abuse has shaped you, and how best to deal with it now??\n\nFor instance, I react to some very innocuous things very intensely. I think they are ridiculous - having a panic attack and crying because of a joke? Ridiculous. But I cannot treat myself like it's ridiculous, and I've explained to SO that neither can he, because these things are emotionally very real for me, and this is why. It takes a few conversations before it sinks in, and I feel like it never fully does sink in.\n\nI know he'll never \"get it\" the same way we do, but is there anything you've had success doing or saying to make people in your life get it just that little bit more?? He's exceedingly logical, which I like sometimes, but is just freaking frustrating at others (like when I'm trying to make him understand specific things about me).\n\nI think other issues he has understanding me sometimes are mainly the inconsistency of some of my triggers, and the fact that he's only known me during a time when I have been at my most stable, mentally and emotionally. So I seem pretty much fine to him every day, and then something small (to him) happens, and I'm having a minor breakdown and telling him that I've got trauma and am a victim of long-term childhood abuse. He knows that it's true, but it's at such odds with the chatty and excitable person he talks to every day.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Or living in the house with the signs I put up of all my positive affirmations and news of my success and celebration of freedom.

Of course don't want to go into to much detail as possible trigger warnings but just putting it out there as could be some, but hopefully might help in some way.\n\nFirst I am a male 36 and first told someone of my abuse 2 years ago when I decided to get professional help. \n\nMy story unfortunately starts young I was the victim of sexual forced abuse both physically and mental for the first 20 years of my life, it started with a family member as it often does in most cases. And then because of unfortunate events carried on throughout my child hood all by males, because of this I suffered from depression and debts in my late teens. I tried taking my own life at 19 but fail of course luckily found by my mum before I did, she was unaware of any of the abuse I have been through as I was good at keeping it secret as was given money as a child to keep quite. She just put it down to my debts and being bad with money, I never got into drugs or drinking and was never in trouble but my addiction was money and porn. The  cycle of given money as a child to keep quite then spending the money on friends so they would like me, this made me happy as it made them happy and like me more but of course to get money I would need to get abused and so it goes on. When I managed to escape the abuse the addiction to money spending and porn sex ect was set in stone, for most of my 20s well till I was 25 I got into massive debts as I no longer has abuses to give me money I turned to banks cards loans. Spending money buying friends and expensive gifts for girl friends that came and went was my drug it made me feel good, it made me feel loved and wanted and of course stopped my feeling the pain I had pushed deep inside. In my mid 20s I moved to the other side of the world thinking like most if I leave my problems will not follow me, the debt and depression was big and had to get out. For a time it was good I traveled for 5 years back parking around and thought all was OK, but the past has a way of sneeking up on you but when it does it can be even worse. When I settled in a different country where I am now my habits came back spending porn, 3 years pass and boom I was 80k in debt full porn addiction meny different relationships with problems. This is when it all changed for my I confined in a friend that I was struggling I never went into details but she recommended counselling, I never thought of getting professional help I always thought I was OK fine and we all not what fine stands for. Getting help just talking about all I went throw was hard at first it was like opening Pandoras box, talking about the abuse and the struggles all at once and after all them years thinking I was OK. The past two years have been the worst but best two years because getting the help I needed the support like male survivors of sexual abuse was a big step, and with the work I did the more I put in the more I got out, don't get me wrong it was hard but they say the best things in life are at the other side of fear. I am at the start of my new journey chapter book and will still face challenges, what I have been through will always be with me and they will be times in life where I will need help,but now I know how to ask for it I have the tools I can use to help myself and others I deal much better with triggers through meditation which can be anything. You don't need to sit the cross legs and going hummmmmmmm, surfing is my meditation I am not that good but I am giving it ago and getting in the water clears my mind. I have got help with my debts through a company called debt fix and self help and professional with porn addiction, it has be an exspirence and no I am not healed and all better but I am much better then I was and getting stronger in my self. I have learned to set boundaries love and trust myself first so I can love and trust other, I have made mistakes We all do but its life and we can learn grow and change we just need to take the first step and know it's OK to ask for help and it will surprise you how many people have been through what you have. In some cases which has happened to me I confined in somone and they had been through the same and had no idea, they was so relief they just had someone how understands and that's so nice to feel and talk knowing somone gets you. We have so much we can learn from each other talk share love and trust, and always remember you are never alone and there is always someone there to give you a  kick up the bum or a hug which ever works best. Anyway if you stayed to the end thanks for listening sorry about spelling ect but hopefully you get my message, always here to talk and never give up it's worth it trust me \ud83d\ude0a", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

[LONG] [MENTION OF ABUSE]", "author": "jmcatm0m16", "self_text": "Just to give you a little bit of background:\n\nMy relationship with both of my parents have always been terrible. My dad used to beat the shit out of us for as long as I could remember. My mom had been sick for a very long time. She had TB Meningitis when she was in her late teens right before she had me and this caused her to have random seizures through out the years. She wasn't medically allowed to drive and could only work part time. My dad always made her feel bad for it and made us feel like we were a burden. She was also clinically depressed and had been taking medication. Their intimacy was non-existent and my dad was openly cheating on her. She would sleep in my bed with me because my dad didn't want her in their bed. When I was 13, my parents separated and I moved to my mom's home country (we live in the US) with her.  Things were going fine until she started drinking and doing drugs. She would drink alcohol whenever she was awake. I would come from school to find her in her own vomit and piss. I would clean her up, clean her sheets and put her to bed. There are a lot of  traumatic things that happened when I lived with her but these are the ones that stick out the most.\n\n1. The lock on the front door of our apartment was very strange. We only had one key, and that key was used on both sides of the door. There wasn\u2019t a regular lock on the inside, you didn\u2019t turn a knob. After you use your key to unlock the door from the outside, you\u2019d have to use the key to lock it from the inside. Without the key, you wouldn\u2019t be able to unlock the door from inside the apartment. When I'd leave for school, my mom would just lock the door behind me and I wouldn't take the key. I came home from school one day and I rang the door bell but she didn't answer. I tried calling her, I banged on the door, I even tried to pick the lock. I eventually had to call maintenance but they didn't have a spare key and the locksmith couldn't get there for a few hours. I thought that she had died. Our apartment was on the second floor and there was a balcony connected to her room so the maintenance guy literally climbed up the side of the building to get her to unlock the door. He banged on the balcony door until she woke up. She had some strange guy in her room and they were both very high or drunk. She got up, unlocked the front door and went back into her room. She didn't say a word to me. I was very hysterical at this point and I didn't know what to do. I called my grandma (her mom) and my uncle (her brother) and told them what happened. They came over the next day and talked to my mom. My mom was somewhat sober that morning, she told them that I was exaggerating and lying about it to get attention. My grandma and uncle agreed to take me to my grandma's house so I can stay there for awhile. I was forced to drop out of high school (I think I was 15 now). In my mom's country, you have to pay to go to school and my grandma wouldn't pay to keep my in school (I say WOULDN'T because she could afford it, she didn't want to be responsible for me). I stayed with my grandma for a couple of months until my mom started calling my grandma saying how she'd changed and gotten clean. I knew this was a lie and I told my grandma that my mom was being manipulative. My grandma wanted me to meet with my mom and possibly move back in with her. I told my grandma that I didn't want to do that. My grandma then suggested that I just visit with my mom and see where it goes from there. My mom had moved into a different apartment in a rougher area. My grandma came with me the day I was to meet with my mom but she wouldn't get out of the car. She said that this is something my mom and I need to deal with on our own, so she'll come pick me up when we're done. My mom was on the 5th floor so I went up and started talking to her. She was acting totally different, she had made me food and had decorated \"my room\" exactly how I wanted it. I already knew I didn't want to live with her so a few hours later I called my grandma to come pick me up and she said she wasn't going to come pick me up. Instead, she was going to pack up my stuff and bring it to my mom's place. I realized that this was their plan all along. I don't remember how I reacted or if I even had a reaction at all. I felt defeated.\n2. A few weeks after I was forced to move in with my mom, she was acting different again. I already knew she was drinking and back on drugs. She tried to hide it from me but it was very obvious. She would lock her room when she left the house or she would lock herself in there for hours. I still wasn't going to school and at this point I already knew I wasn't going back. My mom had been spending all her money on alcohol and drugs. We barely had any food in the house. I had stayed up pretty late one night and didn't wake up until 2pm the next day. You can see the front door of the apartment from my bedroom so when I opened my bedroom door, I saw that the front door was wide open. I had no idea how long it had been open or if someone was in the apartment, I was full on freaking out. I closed the front door and looked around the apartment, it didn't look like anyone had broken it. I go to my moms room and her door is locked. I called her and it went straight to voicemail, she had turned her phone off. I was pretty sure she wasn't home, I didn't know what to do. I knew I couldn't call my grandma again so I decided to call my uncle (my dad's brother, I'm not close with my dad's family so this was difficult). He told me to wait until morning to see if she returns and to call him if she doesn't. I stayed up all night, just waiting for her to come home. She didn't come home so I called my uncle. My uncle and his wife came to the apartment, and stayed for a few hours to see if she'd come home. They both tried calling her but it went straight to voicemail. They agreed to let me stay with them for a while.  Almost 2 weeks went by when she finally called to yell at me and ask me why I wasn't home. My uncle told her that I would be staying with them until I can figure out a way to go back to the US to live with extended family. I lived with my uncle and aunt for almost a year, I still wasn't able to go to school. They weren't able to pay for it as they had two kids of their own.\n\nI was finally able to move back to the US to live with extended family. I went back to high school as a senior but I wasn't able to graduate due to low credits. During this time, my dad had reached out to me. He gave me the spiel about how he had changed. I was happy and I wanted a parent. I moved in with him after senior year and it was the worst decision of my life. I don't want to get into too much detail but he had physically and sexually assaulted me during my time with him. The day that I moved out is the day I thought I was going to die if I didn't leave (this was in 2014). I moved half way across the country and never spoke to him again. Fast forward to 2016, I have a good job, a boyfriend (now ex) and an apartment. My mom had been trying to reach out to me since I had left her and I decided to give her a chance. We were slowly getting back into contact for a few months when she dropped the bomb that she was coming to my state at the end of the week. She had already bought the ticket and was ready to meet ex.  My ex encouraged me to let her stay with us even though we lived in a small one bedroom apartment. She was only supposed to stay for 2 weeks but she ended up staying for 2 1/2 MONTHS. During that time, she made our lives hell. She was manipulative, disrespectful and controlling. She didn't understand boundaries and she didn't respect our home. She started drinking excessively while she was staying with us and she was smoking cigarettes in our apartment while we were gone. She would get drunk, piss the bed and blame our cats. I had enough and we asked her to leave as soon as possible. I hadn't talked to her since the day she left. She would still try to get in contact with me and went as far as filing a MISSING PERSONS report in my city because I wouldn't respond to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI finally responded to one of her many Facebook messages yesterday and she says she's sorry for everything but still continues to be manipulative. I do not know how to deal with this. I have blocked her and a lot of my family members but she keeps making fake profiles and messaging my friends. I have told everyone to block her and anyone who asks about me. Should I just reconcile with her? She doesn't live in the US so I can't get a order of protection. Please help me. I am going crazy here. I finally got help from a doctor and was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and BPD. I have started medication and I'm trying to work on myself but this has completely put my mental state out of whack.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

There are some behaviors that really concern me and I'm wondering if it's normal for Narcs? The two biggest flags:\n\nAfter about a year she stopped wanting sex. No kissing, barely any affection, no sex. If I try to talk about it she rages and tells me things like \"sex needs to be on my terms not when you want it\" and yells and usually just leaves, for hours or a day and ignores me. But it just stopped, super suddenly, and in a year and a half it's not getting better and she never initiates sex or affection, even after seeing couples counselors. \n\nShe is also extremely sensitive to any perceived criticism -- she might even say something hurtful but if I say hey that hurts, she will go offensive and yell at me and throw shit and she's admitted she sometimes \"wants to get even and hurt me back\" -- even if I'm super certain I'm not criticizing her or being rude. My friends think I'm diplomatic and polite but she often accuses me of \"attacking her\" and wants to \"get even\". \n\nMaybe it's something else, but are these behaviors normal for Narcs? It seems like she doesn't feel bad or really care how these things make me feel, and she just gets angry and basically demands I give her whatever she wants (including money even though I pay our rent and bills by myself).\n\nGrumble grumble rant over.

Lots of love bombing, came on strong but seemed harmless. Parents even thought so. \n\nLiked me best when I was mentally ill. As soon as I went to university, he was vicious, controlling. But in a super psychological, insidious way. Made it seem like all my friends were holding me back, that i listened to my parents too much. \n\nHe was 33 when we met, I was 21. He lived at home with his parents, hadn\u2019t had a proper job for ages, lived off his parents\u2019 business. Used to gob on to everyone who listened about what a successful, amazing person he was. Surrounded himself with nasty, abusive people. \n\nHe sucked all the confidence and fun out of me, and I thought it was for my benefit. He made out all my great academic and professional work achievements were silly, nothing, that I was a corporate sellout. Blamed me for not letting him move in with me when I went to university. Blamed me for never having any fun, for being too serious, for not supporting him enough. \n\nI just wanted my life back. And I loved him, I wanted him to build something with me. \n\nFast forward, he can barely contain his contempt for me. Snaps at me, nasty jokes at my expense, talks over me and humiliates me in public, snarls at me whenever I raise a concern. Threatens to leave me constantly. Takes naked photos of me without my consent. \n\nAll the while I was convinced he was a good person, it was for my own good. Then out of the blue, when I go away to look after a bereaved family member, he calls me from a pub, surrounded by girls, telling me he wants a break and I\u2019m too controlling...all the way through the relationship, he isolated and controlled me to the point where I had no one anymore. \n\nJust discarded.

The divorce took more than a year. My ex\u2019s abuse pattern was all under the radar. It was really, really bad. Basically I found out overnight he was addicted to prostitution (which exposed me to potentially deadly risk, given my compromised immune system), had been secretly poisoning me for 5 years to control my behavior, and had been emotionally controlling and abusing me. Really, really bad, outlandish stuff.\n\nEver since I discovered all this, I find that I\u2019m constantly imagining the worst possible outcome for every little thing. Literally *every thing*. It just hit me because my Mother told me she was going to the store. I started asking her if she wanted me to drive. When she said no, I tried convincing her. I realized it was because in the back of my mind, I was thinking of the worst possible outcome. Her going to the store became her getting in a car accident. But if I drove, if I had control of the situation, then somehow subconsciously I thought the odds of that happening would be less. All of that was going on in the back of my mind, without me even fully realizing it. \n\nHas anyone else gone through this? How do I make it stop?

Sorry for potato English.\n\n\nI don't feel quite ready to tell you people the whole story. The most important facts are that I was not aware that he was a narc, even though my dad and all of my previous boyfriends have been (so clich\u00e9, I know); that he has admitted to being a narc, and shouldn't he have done that I wouldn't have come across this sub looking for answers; and that the final discard was exactly a month and six days ago, in an extremely twisted and fucked up way that involved trauma bonding in cycles of approximately an hour long (discard &gt; talk about issues, justify abuse &gt; \"everything is going to be alright\", \"I see a future with you\", comforting &gt; physical affection &gt; \"but it's not the same\" &gt; discard...). He kicked me out before dawn and I had to pack a suitcase and run away to my parents' (a 3 hour train ride away), even though the contract was to my name because I was the one who did the flat hunting and we were living more or less comfortably thanks to what I did for us. (Now I'm aware that I did 100% of the noticing/emotional labour. Were it for him we would be eating in cardboard plates with plastic cutlery.)\n\n\n I thought we had a healthy relationship and attributed all of the flaws to miscommunication and cultural differences, since he's English and I'm from a very Catholic southern European country (\"phlegmatic\" or \"cerebral\" vs. \"passionate\" or, as he put it, \"irrational\" or \"intense\" people). I doubted myself quite often; I felt needy, I saw that he was binge-drinking a lot and lashing out at me after, but I thought it was his style of unwinding after a long day (pub culture and stuff). I lived in constant fear of these reactions of his but, again, I thought it was what I should expect.\nThat's just a tiny fraction of the list of instances of abusive behaviour (yes, I did write a list of those I could remember because I could not process any of this -- \"Was he really gaslighting me?\", \"Was this genuine fear of making him angry?\"), but I think it's enough for now. He was indeed angry all the time, and I thought it was my fault, that he resented me for something that I had or hadn't done. At this point I know that, even though I am not the perfect partner by any means, it wasn't.\n\n\nNow I'm having nightmares every. single. night. in which I relive that final discard (or eternal discard night, since there had been some previous instances scattered over the weeks before that) over and over. He messaged me and told me that he's going to work really hard in therapy to fix himself, but at the same time he doesn't listen, gets defensive and refuses to take any of the blame -- save for constantly saying \"I'm sorry\". \n\n\nAnd I cling to the hope that he can recover or rewire his brain, but I know (and I've been told a thousand times) it doesn't work like that. It just doesn't. And it breaks my heart to think about the good times. Perfect times, actually, at the beginning. The most amazing days I've ever had. It all feels like a dream now. \n\n\nI hate this. This is the most painful thing that I've ever been through. I wanted, and still want to marry this bloke. But I have to protect myself, I guess.\n\n\nI've been going to therapy myself for quite a long time due to other issues (I've been abused before, I'm a rape survivor and also attempted suicide a few years ago), but my therapist has been caught off-guard about this stuff because I seemed to be fine with the way things were. And the truth is, I'm afraid I was, and I don't know if I can forgive myself for that. I had a couple emergency counseling sessions two weeks ago and another one today during which things seemed to be starting to settle, but it just doesn't sink in. Barely a month ago we were talking about our anniversary, and he bought me Chinese takeaway from our favourite restaurant. \n\n\nIf he claimed to be happy with me... Why did he do it? Why did he treat me like that? I know that's not the question I should be asking myself. (My therapist explained how these people's brains function, and that you don't try to understand them because, well, as you already know, if you are relatively sane you just can't.) But this pain is... deaf. I've never experienced anything like this before. I'm navigating blind through the chaos and the loneliness, and I feel as if I had a gaping hole in my chest 24/7. This can't be happening to me. Not again. Not with this guy. Just not him. \n\n\nMy life has been shattered in a million pieces, and I'm not sure I can pick them up. \n\n\nI'm not sure what I'm looking for here. Maybe this is some sort of introduction, maybe I'm just desperate for advice to make sense of this, I don't know. I don't know shit about shit. Nothing makes any sense. I love him, but I'm definitely not ready to accept that he doesn't love me, or even that he has never loved me -- or that I was in love with a fake projection made up by a person I don't actually know. \n\n\n Thank you for reading, and I hope I can start contributing to this wonderful community as soon as I begin to heal.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible that every sexual interaction I\u2019ve ever had has been non-consensual.  \n\n1. One of the bigger \u201cassaults\u201d was when I was 16. I was in college and an older guy (18/19) took me on a date. He pulled over to an empty street and asked me to perform oral sex. I know that I told him \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t be doing this\u201d (exact phrase) a lot of times but eventually he grabbed my head, forced me towards his crotch, and I opened my mouth. \n\nI immediately went home and cried but a few days later, he wanted me to help him study for a test in one of our classes and I said yes. We went to a study room and he began pressuring me to have sex with him. I don\u2019t remember what I said, but I never said yes. I could not leave the room because he kept blocking the door. He tried to get me to perform oral sex multiple times but I would not open my mouth. He eventually held me down and attempted vaginal penetration. I kept moving away and after about an hour he became angry and left.\n\nI\u2019m iffy about this being assault even though I told him I didn\u2019t want to do it because I went back after the first incident even though it made me sad. And I performed oral sex during the first incident in the first place, even though there\u2019s no way he could have physically forced me to open my mouth. \n\n2. Most recently, I went to sleep in a bed watching movies with a guy I really liked (both 18, in college) but I woke up to him touching my butt and breasts while I slept. I didn\u2019t leave even though I was scared, but I turned away from him and pretended to go to sleep. Although it made me upset, I never said no to him so I don\u2019t think he knew. I stopped seeing him after this. \n\n3. That same semester, a guy I considered a close friend kept trying to get me to go to his room with him (even though I wanted to go home) after getting very drunk at one of our friend\u2019s dorm\u2019s. I don\u2019t know if he wanted to hurt me or just hang out with me. I\u2019ve never had a lot of friends so it\u2019s hard for me to tell. I continued to be his friend after this incident and he didn\u2019t do it again. \n\n4. Another time, when I was about 15/16, a boy my age in one of my classes tried to masturbate me during a class presentation. I grabbed his arms and tried to force him from away but he persisted. I couldn\u2019t say \u201cstop\u201d or leave because there were lots of people around and the class was too quiet, so maybe he thought I was just playing hard to get. At a later date, I discovered him taking photos of my various body parts and stopped being his friend. \n\n5. Random guys have always touched me inappropriately in public or said bad things to me in public (I live in Houston, TX so it\u2019s not uncommon) especially when I was younger,  because I\u2019ve always looked much older, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a normal thing for guys to do to girls or if I\u2019m just freaking out because I was molested as a kid and don\u2019t know much about men. And I think I also just look very suggestive, which is part of #6. \n\n6. In high school, when I was 15 I was asked to put on a jacket in front of the whole class by a male teacher who told me I was making him uncomfortable. I was sent to the administrator\u2019s office because I told him it was not a violation of dress code (it was a maxi dress) and she told me he said it because I was \u201cbeautiful.\u201d I was chastised by a female teacher regarding the incident and even though I think he was being weird about my dress, I forgave him and didn\u2019t have my mom call the school, because the woman happened to be my favorite teacher and was \u201cwoke,\u201d so she would have known if he was being weird. \n\nAnother male teacher took me to the administrator\u2019s office on a separate occasion to have them evaluate my outfit (our school was outdoors, and I was wearing a tank top.) It was, in fact, school appropriate (two fingers wide) but they wanted me to put on a jacket anyways. I think my body has always been suggestive (#7). \n\n7. My grandfather says things about me that I consider kind of inappropriate. My mother stopped taking me to his house when I was around 8 (he molested her while she was younger) because he would not stop sitting me on his lap. That ban has since been lifted, but when I\u2019m in his presence he constantly makes comments about my physical appearance being pleasing. He is also preoccupied with the idea of me not gaining weight while I\u2019m in college, and staying pretty. I don\u2019t have any other grandparents, but I know that it\u2019s not super strange for them to talk about your weight so maybe I\u2019m being dramatic. \n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\n\nTDLR; I don\u2019t have any experience with men and therefore have no idea what consensual sexual activity looks like, so I can\u2019t gauge my experiences. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible that all of my sexual experiences have been non-consensual. \n\nI\u2019m really confused and I would really appreciate any insight. I know sometimes men do weird things like this to women but I just want to know if these situations aren\u2019t actually normal.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

On that first day, she went in for the big hug and closeness right after meeting. Then there were the complaints and venting about her early days in the programme. Then came the withdrawal and then the hot and sweaty reconnection. \n\nOver FB messenger, before I relocated, she\u2019d reach out every so often with a desire to \u201chelp\u201d.

A people pleaser. I will maintain whatever hurts me just so people aren\u2019t upset with me. I let people manipulate me. I allowed people into my life that didn\u2019t deserve my love and energy. Even when it was good, great even, didn\u2019t mean I had to give my whole damn life to them. Whose expectation was it? It was a learned behavior from my physically and emotionally abusive parents. When I left home I really focused on healing that trauma. That\u2019s when I met her . I would have said that 2013 me was assertive, opinionated, and had better boundaries. I had self esteem. What happened since then who knows, but it is a slow and steady death. \n\nFor context. I went NC in March, she hoovered. \u201cYou deserve to be heard and we fully haven\u2019t tried that\u201d. My biggest mistake was that I responded. I agreed to give her a chance to talk. I gave her 2 weeks notice of the weekend I felt emotionally stable enough to address this. I gave her 4 days advance of times I was free. She asked me on the last day. \u201cSo what do you want to talk about?\u201d And then it just derailed from there. She wasn\u2019t willing to talk unless I apologized first (already did, but it wasn\u2019t genuine enough) and then proceeded to ignore me. Another 4 days and said I was being aggressive for saying (again) she wasn\u2019t respecting my time. When she was the one who opened this back up. I made her feel unsafe and uncomfortable for just calling her out on behaviour. \n\nThe original fight was small, petty. I apologized. She accepted and was \u201cfine\u201d. She cussed at me and did some serious character assassinations and a lot of projecting. I cried for 2 days straight from the guilt and one of my friends said her reaction was hurtful and inappropriate. So I decided to tell her, that it wasn\u2019t appropriate and then that\u2019s when it all went to shit.\n\n\nI saw with BPD loved ones the following. I make a mistake, she  gets angry, it\u2019s  my fault. She makes a mistake, I get angry, she gets angry, and it\u2019s my fault.\n\nAfter officially going NC in April, a month and a half later I got the hoover.\n\nAnd the hoover was interesting, but I didn\u2019t waiver.\n\nI just reread the email and this is what I got\n\n\u201c I\u2019m sorry for the times I overreacted\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I hurt you and haven\u2019t been the greatest friend\u201d \n\n\u201cI want to work on this friendship if you do\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand if you don\u2019t have the capacity or desire to do this\u201d\n\nI never loved someone like I loved her. I thought it was the greatest friendship 2 people could have. I thought we would be best friends for life. But in hindsight I was a toy she would pick up when she needed it (when she and her new bf got into a fight or he was about to leave her for the 10x) For a short period I was the best toy and the only toy. But once someone else came along...all our inside jokes aren\u2019t funny anymore. She talks differently, she has completely different political beliefs.... she isn\u2019t who she used to be. All the things she guilted me and other women for doing she started doing (make up and dressing a certain way)\n\nI wanted to die when all this went down. I almost had myself committed, but I luckily was so tired I fell asleep and slept for 2 days straight. I cried at work and cried at the stores. I cried doing things I loved. I cried working out. I was a fucking mess. 4 months of therapy and anti depression meds later I\u2019m alive. I\u2019m not responding ever. Bottomless pit of self loathing is what I was left with. She took my assertiveness, confidence, extroversion, humor. And now I just lay on my coach many nights not doing anything. I\u2019m still a shell of who I used to be. It has brought up hold wounds... But at least I still have my life and eventually it will get better. \n\nIdk why I\u2019m ranting. Idk if this helps anyone. I just know that I still think of her and think of the mask she walks around wearing. I saw nothing behind that mask when it came off. Just a scared little girl whose life was so traumatic that she continues to have an alternative reality for herself.

I had just turned 21, young, naive, trusting, and completely ingnorant to how wicked someone could truly be. For years I believed all the lies. I blamed his addiction for his shitty behavior to me. Stealing my debit card and taking so much money from me. Running off with my car for days leaving our baby and I stuck at home. All the crazy stories that never seemed to really add up. He manipulated my mind into a place where I didn\u2019t know what reality was real anymore. Am I really crazy? Was I that horrible? Am I really a stupid bitch? Maybe I did bring this upon myself? Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me... that\u2019s one he likes to remind me of a lot. He would guilt trip me when I was distrusting. So I would try so hard to give him the benefit of the doubt just to find out that once again he was lying. When he would really mess up he would cry and beg me to stay, confess his deep love for me, and promise never to do (insert asshole move) again. And I\u2019d stay.

I\u2019m 18 and I\u2019m trying to find a way to cope with what happened, since I always try to push it aside and not think or talk to anyone about it.\nI was a victim of sexual abuse at age 11. It happened at a transport I would take to school everyday. I had this \u201cfriend\u201d who was 2/3 years older than me. I dont really wanna get into detail because I just had an anxiety attack remembering it today (which I will talk about later) and even thinking about it makes me sick, let alone writing it. It happened several times, everyday going to school. Somehow I still saw him as a friend, because we would still talk, and I still sat next to him everyday, which makes me feel so guilty and sick. Its very hard to say this, but he would give me things, like letting me play a game in his ipad, I guess to not drive me away or rat him out. Today saying this, I just feel so stupid, its like he saw me as a prostitute, and me accepting it made it look like I wanted it, while I just thought he was being nice letting me play, and didin\u2019t understand why at the same he would abuse me. Its just SO sick. I know I wasnt into it at all, but I just stood there silently. I just feel so incredibly guilty and dirty. Even when I tried to avoid him, sitting elsewhere, he would ask me why I wasnt next to him and followed me.\nAnyway, no one I know knows about this, except a girl who he would do the same thing to, I\u2019m pretty sure her sister called him out on it though, so he stopped doing it to her after a short time-I was his main victim- I have not talked to her about it and I dont plan on it. I also cant talk to my parents about it, their reactions would probably be worse for me mentally, seeing as they are not really understanding, also, it makes me feel SO guilty that they were paying so I could get to school safe, and then this happened, and that I still sat next to him. Both of them suffer from mental illnesses so I just couldn\u2019t do it to them. I tried going to a psychologist before but I just couldn\u2019t really open up and basically just lied, saying that everything was ok and only talking about small problems in my life. I\u2019ve considered talking to friends but I\u2019m way too scared to do it too, so I just keep it to myself.\nThe effects of this abuse still haunt me. I\u2019m really insecure, I hate human contact, and I panic if someone even comes close to touching me like he did, even if its someone I like. I have kissed boys before and didnt really feel sick with them, until one of them tried to do the same thing my abuser use to do to me (in this case, this boy wasnt being agressive at all and genuinely didn\u2019t know it would make me uncomfortable) I literally pushed him away immediately, then I tried to play it off so he wouldn\u2019t find me weird. I\u2019m a virgin and I\u2019m terrified of what sex is gonna be like for me, I just really want it to be normal but I\u2019m afraid I might have a panic attack, or that its just never gonna be enjoyable because I will always get that sick feeling in my stomach. \nToday, a girl friend of mine was cuddling me, and I was just SO uncomfortable . I usually dont let people touch me, but I just  didnt want to push her off because she is a very good person and I didnt want to be impolite, and was afraid she would take it the wrong way. I just wanna make it clear she wasn\u2019t being abusive, pushy, or weird AT ALL, she just likes being affectionate to people. Anyway, I started sweating, and when she stopped I just kind of zoned out and started thinking about what happened when I was 11, which I hadn\u2019t thought of for months. I felt this urge to vomit, started shaking, my hands went cold and I had to make up an excuse and leave. It just made me so sad. I just wish I was normal. I remember that as a kid, I used to love hugs and didn\u2019t have a problem being affectionate to people, and now I just feel like this guy messed my whole life up. I also am terrified that people might notice my trauma, cause as I said, I just want to be normal. Other thing that haunts me is that, because I wasnt actually raped, I feel like I\u2019m overreacting and my feeling aren\u2019t actually valid.\nWriting this just gave me that sick feeling again, I dont know if I\u2019ll have the guts to post it but I\u2019d just like to know that im not alone, because for the last seven years its how I\u2019ve been feeling. If someone can share ways of coping, it would be deeply appreciated. I haven\u2019t even come close to saying everything I wanted to, but this is all I can do for now.

So let's go back about 6 months we had been separated around a year and a half at that point and our divorce finally legalized. We were getting alot way better that whem we were together as both oabuse were mentally and emotionally abusive towards each other\nBackstory.\n as she lied alot an was caught cheating a few times throughout our marriage. I was overcontrolling and did not like her talking to certain Male friends as she had sent them risque photos and even had sex with 1 of them.\n   This got bad to the point I didn't want her to communicate with them at all and she would. Well after she finally stopped I was more and more paranoid she was still lying and I started going through her phone, I know this isnt okay I know it's wrong but I just kept telling myself I had to know for sure. This was the last 2 years of our Marriage just fighting and and just a disgusting situation. \nLet's continue so around 6 months ago I get a girlfriend for the first time in 2 decades and my ex flips out on me with jealousy and saying how much I'm hurting her ect. I explain we've been apart for 1.5 years now and are legally divorced. She seems to start coping well after that and we start getting along again. Well about 1 and a half months ago she started chatting up one of my coworkers which I responded go get him he seems like a good guy. \n    Shortly after though he went to his manager and said I told my ex about him and another female. Which I never did and I confronted him and told him I had said nothing I dont know how she would know. A week later he started contacting my manager telling him that I broke several computers at work and I was skipping work ect. Which I also wasnt as we have cameras and they can tell. So I talk to my ex and let her know what hes saying and doing and she was like okay? What do you want me to do. Not much just letting you know hes not the best guy out there and is causing a bunch of drama. \n     So then he went to his manager again and also text my girlfriend that my ex told him I was abusing her and screaming at her over her talking to him. I supposedly smashed my foot through her TV and he was on the phone and heard it all. I got pictures of the TV working the next time I went and also took my girlfriend with me. Shortly after my ex called me and I explained what he said and she told me he was making it all up. So I asked her to stop talking to him or just stop talking about me as something is off with him. I told her I dont want my kids around him whatsoever as hes already been trying to get me fired tried to get my gf to leave me luckily shes not dumb. \n  Well a few days ago he went to my manager again and told him I shared his personal I formation with my ex (also didnt) and that I was causing an unstable workplace for him do to the fact he and my ex were sleeping together. I contacted my ex and asked what his issue was and she said she didnt know but she was in love with him. She offered me full custody of our children  and told me she didnt want to discuss this man again he was going to be part of her life. I flipped out a bit and yelled as she had been sending our children to friends house 4-5 days in a row when she should have been parenting. \n   She blames the fact I flipped out on her because of him when realistically it's because she ignoring our children for him. Hasn't seen them in almost 2 weeks and doesnt want custody anymore.\n\n\nTdlr::: me and ex abusive towards each other shes compulsively lies and cheated a couples time I became over controlling which led to her thinking a guy is more important than anything and I am just trying to control her into leaving him when all I want is him to stop the drama and her to take care of the children.\n\nI have no idea what to do. She wont believe me when I tell her she is making a mistake just calls me controlling and abusive and all my coworkers thinks she is behind the drama of him starting everything and I dont know why.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

There was allllways promises of change. Even a referral to a psychologist, to help him. I took him back.    For awhile the abuse had stopped. But then it started again. Little things at first. And then it progressed. Instead of leaving him, again. I started acting the same way he did. If someone would call him. I'd ask the same questions he did of me for years. Is it another woman you're talking to. Why are they calling so late. Or try to have a conversation with him while he was on the phone with someone else. Or when he would get angry over the littlest things. I started to get angry over the same little things he did. Or when he wanted to get out with his friends.

I adopted the \"if you can't beat them, join them mentality\" . In the hopes that he would see how wrong his actions were, how much they hurt, and would stop. I should have seen at the time that wasn't the way to go. My attitude and actions and behavior towards him. Just bled into my daily life towards everyone after awhile. In other words.

Because it's not really who I am. \n\nI left him a few months ago. He pulled out all the stops again. From promises of change. To threats, to sexual harassment, to threaten suicide. For months. I've just recently gone NC the last month. And in all honesty. It's probably the best thing I ever could have done. From almost the day I left him I sought out a whole slew of professional help for myself.\n\nI guess I'm just wondering if there's someone else out there. Who has done/felt the same way I did.

I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m looking for validation or anger or what. Just thoughts on the situation of whoever isn\u2019t too tired to give them, I guess. Thanks again.

It's become clear to me recently that he clearly has severe NPD.

My mom was at work everyday and he didn't have a job so we were home alone with him. I apologise if some of this doesn't make sense, it's just been years (I am currently 15) and I've only told one person. When I walked into the room he told me to get on the bed and then proceeded to play my favorite movie at the time. I guess we may have cuddled a bit, but that was all until some point he rolled onto his back and made me straddle him. The next thing I knew he had out his penis and he had a boner. He... made me touch it and wrap my hands around it. After that I don't really remember much. Later on he came back into the room, still with a boner, and I noticed that there was stuff leaking out of it. I asked him what it was and he said he didn't know. I now realize that it was precum. After that there's another gap in my memory, and the next thing I remember is him watching porn, but I only knew it as boys getting their privates sucked. Later when my mom was home, I told her about the porn but not anything else cause I thought I'd get in trouble. Nothing like hat ever happened again, thank god, but I think it was only maybe 5 or 6 years ago hat o realized he things he would do are bad. He would call me to his room while he was in bed and make me cuddle with him, even if I didn't want to. It was always difficult to make him let go. This continued well up until I was around 13 and 14 and I would even go near him when he'd call me to his room cause I knew he would try to pull me in. Still I never told my mother because I thought wither she wouldn't believe me or she would break up with him and he was making her happy so I didn't want to ruin that. There was another time when I was around 11 or 12. I had started developing boobs around this age and at the moment I was laying on the couch cause I had a fever. When he saw me he accused me of faking it and proceeded to feel my forehead and all the other areas and then he stuck his hand down my shirt. I was so feverish and out of it that I couldn't stop him. All he did though was lay his hands in between my breasts and held it there for a good minute. My mom and him are broken up now, but for different reasons. I need advice though. My mother still doesn't know and I've only told one of my close guy friends. I need to know if this technically qualifies as abuse. And I just need someone to listen to my story and tell me they understand. Thank you.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Just thought I\u2019d share my story. I\u2019m 27 and he\u2019s 28. We had been together since we were 16 and 17. We finally got married in 2017. Everything was good up until three years ago when he developed a drinking habit after going through some personal loss a year prior to that.\n\nLast year we got into a fight that escalated. He called me every name in the book, said that I was selfish and worthless, etc. He pushed me a few times and smacked me hard across the face. I was about to dial 911 but the police showed up and arrested him for domestic violence when the neighbors called. He spent three days in jail and got the shit beat out of him.\n\nFast forward a year later, and after giving in to the pressure from his mother, reducing the court-ordered restraining order to a \u201cno-negative contact\u201d order, and me trying to repair our marriage, I finally left. I was fed up with the verbal abuse, angry outbursts, the controlling behavior, and victim complex. I had tried leaving after several arguments, but he would physically restrain me from leaving by either pinning me down, standing behind my car, taking my car keys away from me, or holding open my car door to prevent me from closing it. He also expected sex from me every night and threw a fit if I said no or stopped halfway through. He bought expensive lingerie for me and wanted me to wear it for him like I was some cheap hooker. I guess he felt that if he bought me stuff, it would prevent me from leaving him. He would also guilt me by bringing up everything he\u2019s bought me and all the favors he did and put me down for taking anti-depressants, and working part-time when he was full-time.\n\nIt\u2019s been two weeks since I escaped from him and I feel so much happier without him. I\u2019m actually going out with my friends and doing what I love without him complaining about it and acting like a \u201cchaperone\u201d. I\u2019m getting more sleep, doing better at work, and am talking to my family more since he tried to isolate me from them when we were together. I am currently applying for a better job and have travel plans for next year.\n\nI have his work and cell number blocked. His dad is throwing him into rehab after he started drinking again, but he wants us to try to salvage the relationship (I said no). I still have a bunch of belongings at his place and in a shared storage unit (we\u2019ve been living separately), but we don\u2019t have any kids, so hopefully the divorce process will be smooth. I have warned the local sheriff after he showed up at my place drunk and told them about the restraining order, his work address, and access to his dad\u2019s gun safe. Authorities will be serving him the divorce papers since I do not feel comfortable facing him again after everything he did to me. All I care about is moving on with my life without him.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

At that point, I had figured out he was a vulnerable narcissist, but when I broke things off with him (after threats from both sides, me clearly being more serious about it), I had a fantasy of him finally realizing over some months how poorly he had treated me and acknowledging his lies/triangulation/etc. Of course, that is not what happened in the meeting. I told myself I was going to be strong, to demand an explanation.\n\nHe cried, twice. He almost never cried in our relationship. I foolishly felt like we were getting somewhere. I ended up telling him that in our relationship it felt like he was a monster, but once I got some space, I missed him. He asked what started it (the missing). I told him when I had gone to Italy, to Florence...the place we always said we would live together... I sat on the bridge and imagined him there. The way he reacted made me realize that he had no intention of changing, and was just gathering information. It was like he was concentrating/making a mental note. Total silence. No reaction. At the time I thought to myself, \"You're being paranoid. How is he going to hurt you with that information?\"\n\n(Worth mentioning that I also told him I planned on moving to Italy alone for 6 months or so once I paid off my loans... loans do not get paid off quickly, but I'm likely around a year out.)\n\nNow, I found out that he's planning international travel with the new supply. Obviously I have no idea where, but I would put money on a guess for Florence. In total:\n\n* He's released 2 EPs about me since our breakup, flipping the script and gaslighting on both. He released the 2nd EP AFTER he told me he was happy in his new relationship/totally over us/considering marriage and children with the new supply.\n* On the day he released the second one (which he asked me to listen to once it came out, I didn't), he made sure to post three photos: her, the place she lives, and their adventures, on his instagram simultaneously... first posts he had made in months.\n* He's adopted feminist ideology for his new GF, the same ideology which he blamed for our breakup, and for me \"going crazy\". (Also worth mentioning that she is far more radical a feminist than I have ever been- think radical feminism vs. soft feminism, which is more my pace. No hate there, just a different pace... but the fact that he has turned around and adopted it for her blows my mind when he was so against it with me, and arguably pretty misogynistic once you convinced him to talk about it.)\n* He took her ON our anniversary to the same beach house we visited the year prior, again more gushing from her about what a sweet boyfriend he is to whisk her away. Also, more posts to instagram. It's like he knows our anniversary would be a weak day for me, and that I'd look (I did).\n* Now I'm betting anything they're going all the places we planned to go internationally, and I just want to scream.\n\nIt feels like all of the above points were directed \\*at\\* me... to make me upset. (He told me straight up that the second EP would make me upset, but that he still wanted me to listen to it.)\n\n/rant over.

Don't make any effort physically to look good, don't feed their ego, try to talk very little and only about neutral things (what time are you picking the children up? Do we have any coffee?) and keep your tone flat and emotionless. Don't get drawn into any \"lures\" and just be a grey, uninteresting, rock. Share nothing about your thoughts, feelings, aspirations. Nothing they can get hold of and use against you. \n\nThe purpose is to distance yourself and make N realise you are no longer a supply. \n\nBut the therapist (who obviously can't actually confirm my partner is an N, having never met him, but thinks he is definitely being emotionally abusive) thought I should try this and see what reactions I get - but NOT react myself (unless it was dangerous or put me at risk if I didn't, obviously).\n\nNow I'm keen to try this as it seems like a good mechanism to start pulling away. I am already trying to be more independent and do my own things, but currently I'm finding that very interesting and I want to talk about it. I also have ADHD and if something pops into my head, I'm usually quite excited and animated. I wouldn't say I'm hugely interesting, but I'm definitely not boring, and I'm really struggling to reign in my chatterbox impulses.\n\nI wanted to know if anyone had tried Grey Rock before?

To cut a long story short, ever since we moved in together I felt like nothing I did was good enough for her. It was always what she wanted to do, but I was always the selfish one. She would always get really mad and weird over nothing and when I would try to talk things out she would shut down and give me the silent treatment. For me dealing with depression and anxiety (a lot of that being due to the fear of abandonment) it made those things worse for me. So I would just apologise and apologise and thank her for sticking with me and being such a good friend. Not so sure that\u2019s what she was at all now.\n\nThings came to a head when she moved out to live with her boyfriend and told me over text that would be happening. When I took the initiative to, you know, look for a place to live it suddenly became my fault we were moving too soon for her and how dare I go for a flat viewing without telling her or taking her with me.\n\nJump to being moved out, I tried to move past everything at first, but she didn\u2019t seem interested so I gave up. Then I started getting messages about how things had been weird and she wanted to fix them. I was in a super bad place at the time so told her I needed some time before we could talk properly about things. She told me she wouldn\u2019t message me again and then proceeded to delete me off all social media. A month later I get a message asking why I haven\u2019t tried to contact her (why would I if she\u2019d deleted me?!) and demanding I let her know if I want to be her friend or not. She got angry and defensive quick so I let her know that and told her she clearly wasn\u2019t ready to talk either. No reply.\n\nSo we get to now - 6 months later of no contact. I\u2019ve come such a long way on therapy and I\u2019ve started taking meds again and I feel like a totally different person. And then I get the bit one, the actual genuine apology saying that the last 6 months have changed a lot for her and she\u2019s so sorry for how she told me she was moving and feels so guilty... BUT it\u2019s all because my reactions had become so unpredictable.\n\nI was an idiot and I replied, because it just seemed so genuine this time. I guess that\u2019s the point. And I think I knew I needed to send a reply to see if her true colours came out and oh they did. My reply was very long, kind, honest and vulnerable. I asked why she wanted to be friends with someone she felt so negatively about, I said I couldn\u2019t lie to her and move on like nothing had happened without being able to explain the things she didn\u2019t realise had hurt me. I sent the message to a couple of friends to be like please tell me if I\u2019m being a dick, they said the message was absolutely fine, perfect in fact.\n\nBut of course that doesn\u2019t matter. She comes back basically saying she gets what I\u2019m saying about not being sure if she really wants to be friends with me because actually she\u2019s felt negatively about me and the way I am for as long as she can remember. And she pretty much admitted she only sent an apology because she wanted to get one back. She said I\u2019ve hurt her too, but she\u2019s never actually told me what I did. And she told me not to bother replying as we\u2019re clearly not going to get anywhere. Said it seems I\u2019m doing well and to stay safe and take care.\n\nI\u2019m just so... sad and angry? I can\u2019t begin to understand why narcs are this way, I can\u2019t imagine treating someone this way. I spent so long KNOWING she didn\u2019t really like me and felt so negatively toward me just to be told I was crazy. And now she\u2019s admitted to so many of the things I knew I was right about and I should feel validated but I just feel sick and confused. I just don\u2019t understand why. Why would you lie to someone for SO long and pretend to be their friend when you actually don\u2019t even like them at all and waste both of your time? What possibly supply was I giving her if she didn\u2019t even like me? And I\u2019m so mad at myself for having her figured out for so long but not doing anything about it. It\u2019s easier now than it was to not let her words convince me it was all me. All she does is mirror my own words and feelings back at me like she never did any of those things and it was all me. I had to really stop myself from sending back an angry message, because I\u2019m not going down to that level.\n\nI think I\u2019m just venting here but I just can\u2019t understand what the point of any of this is and how to move on and stop feeling so guilty and angry at myself for letting this go on as long as it did.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

And it\u2019s all been completely escalated by this girl. \n\nIf I\u2019m honest, I have no way of knowing if she was a narcissist. I\u2019ve read all the tell tale signs and they all ring true. I\u2019ve read others stories and they all sound similar. Some almost identical. But I can\u2019t prove it. We weren\u2019t together long enough for me to prove it. We weren\u2019t even in a serious relationship, she didn\u2019t seem to know what she wanted at all but kept telling me things like I was her type, she missed me, I made her feel safe, she liked how caring I was, I was the best sex she\u2019d ever had, etc. She eventually ghosted me after all the mind games and hot/cold behaviour and just general fuckery like telling me in detail about people she\u2019d slept with while I was literally in bed with her, got to me. I got extremely anxious as I had asked her to be sexually exclusive and she wouldn\u2019t agree it. She told me she had not much intention of sleeping with anyone else but wouldn\u2019t commit to it. So I had to just sit there in the hope that during this big partying period she had coming up she wouldn\u2019t sleep with anyone. I tried to calmly talk it through with her but she got more and more frustrated. Eventually calling me obsessed. I told her she wouldn\u2019t hear from me again in anger but she did a week later. It was me apologising. She read and ignored it. She ignored my other 2 friendly texts too. I never heard from her again. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to this story. Like a whole issue with her having PID and potentially giving me an std. the whole thing was very intense. I can list more if anyone needs more information. \n\nBut I just can\u2019t believe how easily she could walk out on me after everything. She spent 4 months trying to get me to go on a date with her. Asking pretty much every week. Then after everything we went through and everything she said, she just left. My therapist also says she\u2019s very possibly a narcissist, but we have no way of knowing. \n\nI\u2019ve just been left completely broken by this. It\u2019s been 3 months now and I still think about her and what happened obsessively every single day. I can\u2019t get over it. She graduated from uni yesterday and I saw all her uni group in town and she didn\u2019t even mention it to me. Didn\u2019t even give me a second thought. I\u2019ll never see her again because she moves 4 hours away from me now. \n\nHow do I deal with this? After being told I have depression, I don\u2019t know where to go from here. I physically can\u2019t sink any lower. I feel awful all day every day and I\u2019m getting headaches.

Yes, mothers are going to overthink things. Yes, mothers want the best for their children. However, since I've been home all day, everyday this summer, I can't help but notice certain things about my mom that just don't seem...well, motherly. If all of this is just the result of me being an ungrateful teenager, please say something in the comments below because I genuinely don't know whether I'm losing my mind or if she is. \n\nSo, for a bit of context, my mother is a Jehovah's Witness. Likewise, I was raised in the religion, never celebrated holidays growing up, barely had any friends, and always lived in fear of Armageddon. For reasons I'd rather not get into, I decided that I no longer wanted to attend ''meetings'' (as they like to call their weekly church services) and eventually denounced my faith. Now, I'd just like to say that my leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses was, long story short, because I had been emotionally abused by a trusted member of the congregation, not because I had a secret boyfriend as many people like to believe. I was fifteen when all of this happened and instead of comforting me, my mom acted like she was the one suffering the most. Now, believe me, I understand that this was not an easy time for my mom as well. In her eyes, her daughter had just rejected god and, because of that, was going to die in Armegeddon. However, I was a fifteen year old girl who had been manipulated and harassed for two years, going through depression, and even contemplated suicide. None of that matter to her though, no matter how vocal I was about my problems. She even once walked in on me harming myself. Her solution? She tried cancelling my therapy session because...''they weren't working and she was done paying $10 per session.''\n\nAnyways, it's been a year since all of this has happened and while I'm still living through the trauma of last year, I've honestly never been happier. I love my new friends, I'm entering my senior year of high school, and summer so far has been nice. Or at least that was until today. So, I recently fell for one of my closest guy friends and, even though I know a romance would never work out between us, I want to spend the rest of the summer with him before he goes off to college in another state. However, every time I ask my mom if we could hang out, she explodes. Once again, I understand why she wouldn't want me to hang out with a guy, but...she always lectures me instead of simply saying no. Did I mention she always goes the extra mile and humiliates me in front of my brother, saying stuff about how she can't trust me alone with my crush because I might seduce him?\n\nIt's not just that too, I've noticed things about my mom that I really can't unsee. For instance, if my brother does something wrong and apologizes, my mom doesn't think twice about it. However, if I do, well...she never forgets about it (by the way, my brother is still a Jehovah's Witness). If my brother does something wrong and my dad tries punishing him for it, my mom will always step in and yell at him for ''hurting her precious son.'' Meanwhile, she has no problem not feeding me for days because of a ''religious conflict.'' She'll always make sure to remind me of past mistakes I'd rather forget about and lash out on me when I ask her to stop. Not to mention, she thinks my dreams of going to college is unrealistic and pointless and that, unless I become a housewife, I will never amount to anything. Whether or not she's actually abusive or not, I don't know...after all, not only is she crazy religious but she's also from South Korea.

He immediately tells me to shut the fuck up and say \"what are you talking about?\" Everytime I asked for an apology.

Watching my boss try to leave the room as soon as possible when talking to me vs him trying to talk for as long as possible with other employees made me feel bad about myself. I felt lonely at home and at work.\n\nAfter work, I tried to call my lover to have someone to talk to, but they didn't answer, so I thought they were still at work then I passed their car at a gas station near home which is an hour away for them and I was upset that they ignored my call.\n\nFoolishly, I headed to my parents' house as I knew the sister closest to me was there. My youngest sister, who I affectionately call \"Satan\", came up to me and started saying that I was unsympathetic unlike another sister who lost her lover to suicide. I really liked the lover and wished at various points that she would have lived. In my twisted mind, I had wished that I could kill myself for her to live. \n\nIn any case, the sister we were discussing wasn't a good person and bad things sometimes do still happen to bad people. Feeling particularly vulnerable, I began talking about my childhood with my family. I talked about how my father had my other sisters strip me \"as a game\", about the back injury he caused, about his anger and violent outbursts, about him dropping keys in the cactus and telling me I was to pick them up, about how my parents forced me to watch my little brother all the time and never really allowed me to see my friends so I lost them all amd that they allowed my other sister who we had been discussing to run away from watching my brother when I begged for a little time for myself. I never had the key to the large fence that surrounded the propert early on, so I would throw a stroller over the fence and cradled my little brother and jump over the fence to be able to see the outside world that I desired to be a part of, so badly. I also talked about being beaten by various siblings. Since my grandmother was there, I left out stories of my mother excusing the abuse such as when she told my father to \"avoid leaving welts. We could be arrested\" when he would beat me. \n\nMy mother seemed to feign incredulousness when I told everyone these stories and Satan began to cry at various points. My mother said she did not know about any of this when she was either present or was told it previously. Satan asserted that I should have threatened and bullied my way through, but as the oldest assertion just left me as a bigger target. Throughout, there was a persistent theme of them asking me why I didn't do things. My mother asked why I didn't talk to my father earlier about all of this (my father wasn't at the event). Why would I want to vulnerably open up about things he knew he did? \n\nOnly my sister closest to me came to hug me as a sobbed uncontrollably. She whispered in my ear to tell them about a previous terrifying roommate I had, but I told her that I wanted to just talk about family. She messaged me after and I know I sounded really bitter in my reply. I was angry that people supported one of my sisters that actively lied and forced me to pick up all the slack after everything I did for her. In the past, they talked about how much warmer a person she was. Of course she is. She got to escape while I suffered.\n\nI told them that there wasn't a single moment growing up that I was really happy. As if to try to absolve my mother of guilt, my mother asked me later in the conversation and I said yes. How could I have been when I was being sexually, emotionally, and physically abused by my father and my sisters (one sister sexually abused me, but I did not bring that up). It's been two days since this happened and my mother that feigned sympathy never called me, neither my grandmother who I used to talk to, and my sister closest never responded or called me to checkup on me. I texted Satan and told her that I had tried to stand up for myself, but was beat down. She didn't reply. \n\nI don't know what I was thinking. Maybe, I had hoped for more sympathy. But I felt like a loser complaining to everyone who put in great effort to destroy me that they destroyed me. I hate myself. I hate what have become.

I knew he was having trouble making friends and I was a bit worried about him being lonely so I didn't mind him being around so much, even though I kind of wanted a bit more space.

I kind of just ignored it and things seemed to go back to normal pretty quickly.\nI'll skip forward some time and my friend is staying the night again.

And every thing they do for me reminds me how miserable I was. And how not normal my relationship was before, or how awful my nex actually was. \n\nFor so long I thought I was the problem. I was simply not capable of properly loving, I was too unconfident and my moodswings got the better of me. I couldn't properly give every part of me. All common excuses I used to myself. When I finally decided to go NC, it wasn't because I fully realised how bad he was affecting me. It was other people telling me my ex threatening me with old pictures was not normal. My ex trying to force me to tell him about my picture sending habit was not a normal thing. And I'm glad I believed those people. I'm glad he lives 5 timezones over and 10000KM away, and that all our mutual friends were mine long before they knew him.\n\nNow that I have found someone who actually makes me feel like I might be capable of love, I realise that it wasn't me that soured our relationship. Forcing me away from my family and friends is not a normal thing. Getting bored of my stories and things I like is not normal. Whining and making me feel bad for saying no is not normal. Trying to get me to overstep my boundaries is not normal. And most of all, emotionally manipulating me to seeing only my own mistakes, is not normal. And after 2 years of that and an additional year of haunting me, I've finally come to terms with the fact that I am not okae after having experienced all that, starting from age 15. And I have accepted the fact that I need proper help.\n\nI could go on for pages about all the ways he manipulated me, but in the end, I truly think he was convinced of himself and felt that the world was truly out to get only him and I belonged to him fully, but I also believe he isn't fully bad.

[TW: Sexual abuse] [TW: Abortion]", "author": "idontknowmybro", "self_text": "If you ask my ex-abuser (X) why we broke up or who I am, he'll tell you I'm the ex who \"killed his baby and broke his heart.\" Here's the real story.  \n  \nWe started dating in January 2017. I originally wanted casual sex, but he pressured me into a relationship after a week or two. I didn't realize how much he pressured me until later on, when I looked back at everything that happened.  \n  \nFrom the beginning, I told him I didn't want children yet. However, for the right man, I would have a child when we're emotionally and financially ready for one. He told me that's okay because he was unable to have children due to radiation exposure from his time in the Army. His father 100% backed him up on this.  \n  \nI can't tell you when the abuse started, but I think it started with him putting down my interests. Like, there was a song I really liked, and he listened until one part, said to turn it off because \"it's not that good, he couldn't even hit that note right.\" The note sounded fine. I asked him, \"can *you* hit that note?\" He didn't have anything to say after that. He also hated my favorite TV show so we could never watch that. X eventually started playing whatever show he wanted all the time. I told him I wanted to watch shows that I liked instead and he would ignore me and put his show on anyway. I started to go into the other room whenever he did that, and he would get mad at me because I \"would rather go talk to God knows who instead of hanging out with him.\" And almost every time we disagreed on something, X would tell me that I'm stupid and don't know anything because I was 19. Why date someone 7 years younger than you if you think they're so stupid? Oh, right. To abuse them...  \n  \nX was jealous of every other man I came into contact with. I worked in a restaurant that does delivery (I basically just made food and helped customers.) X used to sit outside for at least 20 minutes before I was scheduled to leave. He would trash talk my GM when I didn't get off work on time, but you never do in the food service industry. Sometimes it's 15 minutes early, sometimes it's an hour late. He threatened to plant crack rocks in my GM's car if he wouldn't start letting me out of work \"on time.\" My GM had done nothing wrong, plus he had a wife and young child. I told X that if anything happened, I would tell the police right away that he did it. He got angry with me and said that I was a bad girlfriend if I \"went against him like that.\" I told my GM that X kept freaking out on me every time I wasn't off work on time, so he started to let me leave at my scheduled time to avoid that, even if he still needed my help (GM did not know X was abusive, he just thought he was a dick).  \n  \nX became suspicious of a delivery driver (TG for Tall Guy) because he was tall, which was my \"type\" in high school. He told me that I \"wasn't allowed to talk to him at work anymore unless it's work related,\" so I stopped talking to TG if it didn't have to do with work. One day, I was talking to my GM, and laughed at something he said when TG walked by. When I went outside 20 minutes later, the first thing X did was ask me why I was talking to TG and why the fuck I was smiling at him. I didn't even know he was there that whole time, but I hadn't talked to TG at all because I was forbidden or whatever. I immediately told him I wasn't, I was laughing at something GM said, but he wouldn't believe me.  \n  \nOn Father's Day, my sister and I picked up some food from my work. A new employee, a redheaded guy (RH), was behind the counter, but I barely noticed. When we left, my sister told me RH was checking me out. X got mad at ME for that, and told me that I shouldn't be around my sisters anymore because \"they're trying to set you up with someone else.\" I actually started dating RH 2 months after I broke up with X, mostly out of spite (which I told RH), but we're happy.\n  \nX worked something like 8am-3pm most days. I usually worked 4pm-9 or 10pm. He would usually sleep from 10pm-6 or 7am, while I usually slept 1am-10am. He would always get mad at me, and accuse me of cheating because I stayed up later than he did. You know what I was doing when he was asleep? Playing Pet Rescue Saga.  \n  \nSpeaking of pets, I brought my very dependent and skittish dog, Chloe, with me when he asked me to move in. He blew up on me one day before work, for reasons I don't remember, and said he wouldn't take me to work that day, again, for reasons I don't remember. I sat outside on the porch and started to call an uber for work. He came outside and tried to yell at me some more, but I told him to leave me alone and that I was leaving for work. He threatened to let my dog loose into the neighborhood while I was gone if I left. I walked back up to the door and said \"you are not going to let my dog run loose while I'm at work for 6 hours, that's crazy!\" So, he started calling Chloe with the door wide open, trying to tempt her to run outside. I kicked him in the shin. He screamed, and I mean screamed, louder than I've ever heard him, with this crazy fucking look in his eye, told me to get the fuck out of his house, I'm abusive, etc. I ended up hyperventilating on the bathroom floor, then crying and staring at the wall, and missed work. The only other time I had been physically aggressive with someone was when I was in kindergarten and kicked a boy in the balls for calling my sister a fat pig.  \n  \nAnyway, onto the sexual abuse. When we first started sleeping together, I told him I liked rough sex and being a little submissive sometimes. He took that to mean he could do whatever he wanted to me, whenever he wanted. So, we would have sex, he would finish at some point, and then he would continue trying to stimulate my clitoris, despite me saying \"that was fun, but I'm done now, I don't want to cum anymore. I don't even think that I can at this point. There's too much stimulation right now. This hurts. Please stop. My vagina is on fire right now, stop touching me.\" But he would physically hold me down and keep going. I started faking orgasms to try to get him off of me. He would say things like \"see, I knew you liked it.\" And I would tell him \"no, I really don't, it hurts, I was just trying to get you to stop.\" On at least 3 occasions, my labia was red/purple and swollen to 3x the normal size, and it HURT to pee. I mean, it fucking burned and felt like I was being stabbed at the same time. But he \"knew I was exaggerating and I really liked it.\"  \n  \nX manipulated me into letting him ejaculate inside of me multiple times in July 2017. He would say that it's okay because he can't have children. I told him I wanted him to stop because my vagina smelled terrible every time he did it. But when he was about to finish, he'd ask if he could finish inside of me and I would say yes in the heat of the moment (also wanting approval). I told him a few times \"no matter what I say to you during sex, do not cum inside of me anymore. I don't want to risk pregnancy and my vagina smells like death every time. I hate it and I don't want you to do it anymore.\" But that didn't stop him, he would remind me that he couldn't have children and I should just let him do it.  \n  \nHe also had some hygiene issues. I never saw him brush his teeth but I can't \"prove\" that he didn't brush them. He was uncircumsized and didn't clean his foreskin very well most of the time, and I could usually smell it as soon as he took his pants off. He would try to get me to give him a blowjob, but I couldn't stand the smell and would ask him to take a shower first. He would tell me I didn't love him if I wouldn't just do it. Eventually I stopped giving him blowjobs and stopped having sex with him as frequently. He brought his up a lot and I would tell him every time, \"it's because you don't listen to me when I ask you to do or not do things.\" He would say that I just didn't love him enough.  \n  \nHe went through my phone every night when I was sleeping to try to find something to be mad at me about. He woke me up in the middle of the night on multiple occasions to yell at me about things I said to other people in private.  \n  \nEventually, I decided to go through HIS phone while HE was sleeping because I thought he might be projecting. There was a girl he worked with, that he claimed had tried to kiss him before we started dating. I found a message to her saying that I don't put out often enough, like he was trying to get her to sleep with him since I clearly wasn't satisfying him anymore. For the record, they didn't talk outside of him buying weed from her, so he was not \"just confiding in a friend.\" I even confronted him and he couldn't give me a reason as to why he said that to her.  \n  \nWe broke up for like a day, in which I spent the night at my father's house with my sisters and watched Django Unchained. We got back together the next day, we had sex, and he said something like \"you want daddy to cum inside of you, don't you?\" And I wanted his approval (emotional abuse will do that to ya) so I said yes. This time, I got pregnant. He told me he would support me in whatever decision I made.  \n  \nI was leaning toward abortion because I was making 7.25 an hour on less than 30 hours a week (about 350 a month) and I didn't think either of us were ready for a child. I told him that in the car on the way home from somewhere, probably. He screamed at me, inside the car, \"YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M READY FOR.\" I said \"this is exactly why I don't think you're ready.\" He tried to convince me not to because \"his ex had two abortions and cried for weeks after.\" I told him I'm okay with crying for a couple weeks if that means when I do have a child, he or she would have a good life.  \n  \nHe also demanded a paternity test because we had broken up for one day, even though he knew I was at my dad's because we'd been talking all night, and he saw the snapchat I sent of the Django Unchained opening credits. I literally did not leave my father's house that day, nor did anyone come over that wasn't family. I don't think I really have to say this, but I didn't sleep with anyone besides him from the beginning.  \n  \nMy dad planned a trip with me and my sisters (S1 &amp; S2) to see the eclipse in August 2017. The morning my dad picked me up for the trip, X started a fight with me. I'm guessing that he thought I'd choose to stay with him and \"work things out\" rather than spend a nice weekend with my family. The fight was because I made the decision to abort, and he was not happy with it. He said he \"wouldn't respect me if I had an abortion,\" despite telling me from the beginning that he'd support me no matter what. I broke up with him, stating \"I won't be with someone who doesn't respect me.\" He would not stop texting me, trying to make me reconsider and get back together with him.  \n  \nWhen we got back from the trip, S1 and I got ALL of my stuff from his house while he was at work and I left my key on his living room table. He texted me something like \"don't go into my house when I'm not home without telling me again.\" said something to the effect of \"You don't have to worry about that. I went while you were gone because I do not want to see you. I only took my own things and I left the key on your table, plus I locked the door from inside before I left. Please stop texting me or I will block your phone number.\" You all know what happened next. So, my phone had this thing where you could read blocked messages if you went to your settings or whatever. I could see he was still texting me for at least a month after.  \n  \nS2 took me to have an abortion on September 12th, 2017, a little under 2 weeks before my 20th birthday. He told everyone that I'm a heartless baby killer. The truth is, he abused me, and I was forced to terminate a pregnancy that I would have carried to term had he not been the father. He had been texting S2, asking for information about me. Because there is only one Planned Parenthood office that performs abortions in our state, S2 waited until we got back home to tell him that it was done and to leave us both alone.  \nI never reported him and just blocked him on everything I could. I couldn't even admit that what happened was rape until a year after we broke up. I still contemplate pressing charges all the time. And I still mourn the loss of my first pregnancy, despite whatever he may have told everyone.  \n  \nToday, I had a memory that he commented on pop up. I don't know why it showed me his comment and profile picture when I had him blocked. But that's what led me to post. Now, I will be taking a very long shower. Thank you for listening. \u2764  \n  \n  \nEDIT: fixed formatting, added missing words, and some extra detail. Also, I apologize for the spelling mistake in the title, I was really nervous to post (and still am, lol.)  \n  \nEDIT2: I wanted to add that X and his dad smoked cigarettes in the living room all the time. I asked them to stop smoking inside on multiple occasions because of my dog. The back porch was 10 feet away, while the front was 2 feet away. They didn't stop smoking in the house until they found out I was pregnant. And I think that's when I started to realize I was just a fuck doll/baby maker to X.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Two nights ago 2 random names added me on Snapchat- they both sent pictures of \u2018themselves\u2019 right away.. and one had an IG to go with it that was active since 2018.. and the snap chatters had 2000 plus snap points... but quickly they became too pushy , \u2018so you\u2019re busy?\u2019 Then making weird spelling mistakes but using perfect grammar (something he prides himself on) and the misspelling seemed so out of place... the questions from guy 1 were \u2018 can I come see you, etc etc\u2019 and eventually I asked for a LIVE picture of his face not a sent one from camera roll.

Every once in awhile I have one of those \u201clightbulb\u201d moments, and they are usually pretty right on the money:  I\u2019ve been reading comments from other people who have tried to help me feel better by telling me that my deadbeat Narc ex and his new supply are more than likely miserable together despite their efforts to portray themselves as a happy family.  Well knowing his past track record with her, that probably isn\u2019t too far off the money at all.  If you have broken up with someone 4 times already before, gotten into physical fights, and been sent to jail several times over it, then yeah history is sure to repeat itself.\n\nBut I just suddenly realized something else:  My ex recently bought a D-9 bulldozer.  Yes, a BULLDOZER.  He financed it.  I don\u2019t know what the total principle loan cost was, but his payments are around $1400 a month.  He is self-employed, so his income isn\u2019t 100% steady like my salary is.  Sometimes he gets a lot of work and sometimes not.  Back when we were together, he had been talking about wanting to buy a bulldozer, and he had mentioned to me that we should wait awhile to have a baby because he thought the cost of a baby would interfere with buying a bulldozer.\n\nWell now that his old supply is back for the fifth time, he is now supporting her, their two kids, and another baby due in the fall.  She doesn\u2019t work, so he will soon be 100% supporting FOUR people.  And now he ALSO has a $1400 per month loan bill for that bulldozer.  I can\u2019t help but wonder what his reaction was when she became pregnant while he was still wanting to buy a bulldozer.  I wonder if he bitched and moaned about it like he did when he found out I was pregnant?  And I\u2019m starting to suspect that money is very tight in that house now that he is supporting 3 people and trying to pay for a bulldozer.  That\u2019s likely why she recently made a new Facebook business page for his business, to market it and attract more customers to bring in more income.\n\nIf he bitched about money and having to support JUST ME when I wasn\u2019t working, then I\u2019m pretty sure he will soon begin bitching at her for having to support her and a THIRD child soon.  If he is struggling to make the monthly payments for the bulldozer, then that means there is less money for them to buy diapers and whatever else the kids and the new baby will need along with her needs.  And that means tensions are sure to blow soon if they haven\u2019t already!!! \ud83d\ude0f\ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf7f", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

What did you get up to?\" or \"How are the kids?\" or even \"What did you get your degree in?\"\n\nAnd the answers might be something like this:\n\n\"How was your weekend? What did you get up to?\" \"Good, I went fishing and caught a big one.\"\n\n\"How are the kids?\" \"The kids are great, my son just had his 4th birthday party.\"\n\n\"What did you get your degree in?\" \"I got my degree in Anthropology at St. Mike's College.\"\n\nAnd then the conversation continues, and they may or may not remember what you told them, and the day goes on.\n\nBut for covert narcissists, they remember that shit. They remember that stuff like they've written it down. And then they bring it back to use it to gain control. For example...\n\nOne day some coworkers are chatting, and the boss comes around. Somehow the conversation becomes how Anthropology is a useless degree. The covert narcissist uses this moment to say, \u201cDid you know that [your name] got an Anthropology degree?\u201d\n\nor\n\nSome coworkers are chatting about how fishing is a waste of time. The narcissist intervenes with, \u201c[Your name] goes fishing all the time! He just went this past weekend!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s stuff like that. Normally harmless pieces of information that you\u2019d normally have no problems with saying, are now being used to shine a bad light on you. Now, these examples are not too harsh, they\u2019re not too extreme, but they\u2019re definitely not *normal*. They definitely don\u2019t say \u201cHey I respect your boundaries\u201d, they say \u201cHey if you tell me *anything*, even the color of your toothbrush, I will remember it and try to use it to push you down.\u201d \n\nIt's like, I didn't even know I needed this boundary because most of the time, I don't. But the narcissist has *made* it into something that now needs a boundary.\n\nIs this why people end up gray-rocking narcissists? Because they use literally anything you say, as a means to gain control? So you can\u2019t give them *anything*?\n\nTo be honest, it\u2019s such a weird thing to have to do. Because most people are not trying to use everything against you. With most people, you can keep your boundaries at a place that allows you to share what you had for breakfast, but with narcissists, you can\u2019t share *anything* because *they* are always trying to use it all to gain power.\n\nIt\u2019s so strange, and it\u2019s really difficult especially in situations where you\u2019ve got mostly non-narcissists with one narcissist thrown in there. Like a narcissistic coworker in the office. Obviously you can\u2019t stop them from hearing *some* stuff that you\u2019re saying to other coworkers, so it\u2019s this weird balancing act you have to do all the time, of being open with other coworkers but trying not to tell that one narcissistic coworker anything. It\u2019s also hard because you can\u2019t blatantly say in front of the other coworkers \"I don't want to share this information with you\" to the one narcissist especially if they are covert, because then everyone thinks you\u2019re just being mean to that one person when really you\u2019re just protecting yourself because they keep trying to use the most harmless comments against you. It\u2019s really annoying.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This post is actually a year after the relationship ended. I was head over heels in love with her when I met her when college started. Didn't see the signs and let myself get swept up despite a glaring lack of reciprocal communication, even in the early stages of our relationship. When it was good it was great, but it got terrible fast. When we had to do distance for periods of time, I would get ghosted for up to a week at a time, maybe longer, with her always calling the shots on when we talked but only whenever she felt like it. At school, she would always promise plans and then back out last minute. She had her own issues she was just starting to deal with, which included fits of manic depression, during which a casual hangout could get emotionally nasty quickly. By the end we were, very frustratingly to me, only spending time together in groups of people where none of our issues could be talked about. At that point I didn't think I could just 'break it off', I was deeply codependent and too scared and feeling alone to even consider alternatives.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we broke up, it just so happened that some of my closest friends at school also turned on me in a way, and weren't there to help lift my spirits or ask if I was ok. The proceeding school year turned into a terrible depressive time sink, where I found myself alone, disconnected from my friends/roommates, family, ambitions, personal interests that used to fill my life with meaning and give me self-confidence and self-love. Grades slipped and I almost dropped out. I still can't describe totally what happened, but it was like an identity dissolution, where I almost completely stopped caring for myself, became uninterested in other people as well, and started to drift through life in a depressive haze.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I've been back home with my family for a couple months, and largely through the help of some great friends from high school who have stuck through with me through the down times enough for me to wake up to my state a little, I've started to find some hope (and maybe a little bit of self-compassion?). I've started a therapy practice which hasn't helped yet in any obvious ways but I'm hoping it will. I still get kind of angry at myself for the fact that I'm still brooding on a relationship that ended a year ago (I don't want to blame all of my problems on it, since it's totally out of my control and in the past) but I'm still looking for encouragement and advice because I have a fear of regressing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething that's troubling me is that at the worst our sexual relationship became very one sided (where I had no say as to when, and weekly cycles of her promising/withholding until we just stopped having sex), and I still feel like the hurt that I carry also envelops forming intimate relationships with new people, which is really disheartening. Some of the emotional abuse was related to our sexual relationship, and even though I can draw on positive sexual relationships from before we were together, it still hangs with me and stifles my confidence when there's someone I could see myself interested in. Just mentioned this blurb in particular because I haven't talked with my therapist (or anyone) about this and it feels good to let it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Another thing: how do I avoid being angry at myself for potentially wasting years of college that I could have spent forming quality relationships and making memories that I don't want to forget?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

His intensity when he said he really liked you, while slowly running his hands down your hips. The playful butt grab while you\u2019re walking side by side. The ease that he carried around him, and the lack of hesitation when he said he\u2019d pay for the $300 restaurant bill. His naughty wink when he said he booked a hotel room for the night. His heated trail of kisses as he guided your body down the California king bed with rose petals... \n\nI fell deeply for them too. Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019d experience more with time. He\u2019d take you to many beautiful places that you pinned on your Pinterest board. He\u2019d take you on a yacht ride to see the whales, with bubblies in your hand, as he nuzzles your neck. He\u2019d convince you to be on adventure motorcycle rides, with you wrapping your arms around him, your life in his hands, you and him taking on all the curved roads, tightly bound together.  \n\nPlease enjoy them at the fullest. Fill your heart with love and contentment. Take plenty of pictures. Write a journal. Make videos. Carve the happy, blissful, loving memories in your mind. Remember who you are at this moment. Ask him why he loves you and make sure you remember the reasons, because that\u2019s who you are and that\u2019s what makes you beautiful. \n\nPlease keep your family and friends around. They need to meet him; they need to know your dream man is real. See how he\u2019d relate to the people you love and how he talks about  them on your way home. Watch how he\u2019d play with your pets or children in the family, if at all. Appreciate him for when you tell him about your family\u2019s deepest secrets, and how reassuring he would be when he simply hugs you while you cry on his warm, strong chest.\n\nBe curious. Ask about him, his childhood, his passions, his hobbies, his thoughts, his family, his friends. Try to dive into him like he did with you, because he\u2019s got an interesting story to tell\u2026 if he ever tells you at all. \n\nAt some point in your love story, you\u2019d argue. You\u2019d fight with your claws out and the arguments would get more and more personal, with each one stabbing your spirit deeper and deeper. You\u2019d feel exhausted and lifeless. As you sit on the floor with hot tears stinging your eyes, attempting to explain how hurt you are feeling, he\u2019d look down on you, with a cruel glint in his eyes, and say, \u201cHow is that my problem?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d make you stop seeing other people you love because all of a sudden, he\u2019d say he never really likes them - that your dad has made stupid financial decisions like you do, or that your best friend is an alcoholic and maybe you are too. He\u2019d tell you to not go to your favourite pilates class because you\u2019re turning out to be as bitchy as the girls you go to class with. And that pottery class you love? Forget it. Where is he supposed to put all the ceramic you\u2019d lovingly make for him?\n\nSometimes you\u2019d find it hard to please him. You\u2019d pull all the tricks up your sleeve - you\u2019d do anything for him to look at you again with stars in his eyes, for him to touch you tenderly, for him to hold you close as you fall asleep, for him to call you \u201cgorgeous\u201d as you made love. But for now you\u2019d settle with the fact that he only yells at you once today, and that he says \u201cthank you\u201d as you give him a beer bottle. You\u2019d probably consider giving him two, or three, or maybe four bottles\u2026 until his cheeks are red, his playful demeanor is back, his hands all over you, and him saying \u201cFuck, I love you\u2026\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d stare at his peaceful sleeping body at night, marvelling at how lucky you are and how you\u2019re brimming with love for him, and yet when you show him that scar on your leg when you fell on your bike when you were ten, he\u2019d nod at you distractedly and go back to chatting on his phone with God-knows-who. You love him so much you\u2019d leave your job to be with him full time, and yet he\u2019s annoyed that you\u2019re standing around at home doing nothing. You are so dedicated to him that you end your gym membership so you could spend more time together in the mornings, and yet he\u2019d grab the flab on your belly and say you should stop being fat so he\u2019d still have sex with you. You\u2019d make him the centre and the only person in your life, because he\u2019s right, your family and friends never really like you anyway. You love him so much you surrendered all your power to him because he\u2019d be too happy calling the shots, but when you get home he\u2019d berate you for not making up your mind. God, you\u2019d even give up driving when he\u2019s your passenger because you\u2019re a terrible driver and you know it, because he told you so.\n\nEven when you feel broken, confused, and deeply alone, make sure you try to remember it. When he would be raging mad because he sees your empty coffee takeaway cup in the car because you\u2019re not supposed to buy coffee because you don\u2019t deserve it, make sure you get the dashcam video. That one time he criticises you for taking too long in the bathroom because you changed tampons and God you bled so much, write about it on your journal. That time when he\u2019d throw his hammer on the wall because he catches you having breakfast and he says you shouldn\u2019t be eating anything because you\u2019re fat and you have no self-control even though you\u2019re having an extreme hyperacidity episode and you need to eat badly - make sure you have it on record. Don\u2019t make the mistake of drowning your sorrows in a bottle of red wine, or else he\u2019d call you a hopeless alcoholic. \n\nOr the worst thing yet - that night when you\u2019re in trouble with him again, the ninth time in the week and it\u2019s only Monday, and yes you know you\u2019re in trouble a lot because you write everything down in the journal hidden in the bathroom vanity, when he brings up all your secrets and vulnerabilities, and tell you your parents can\u2019t stand you because you\u2019re their least favourite daughter, that your friends aren\u2019t even remotely interested in you, that you\u2019re the reason why he was so stressed out, that because of you he\u2019s so close to burning the house down and make all the \u201cproblems\u201d go away, that he thinks you are not the special, selfless, beautiful girl he fell in love with, fuck, even the sex is below average at best\u2026\n\nThe full bottle of Vicodin feels warm in your hand right now. \n\nPlease, when you get to this stage, please, please, tell someone. It doesn\u2019t matter - your doctor, your bank teller, your mum who you thought hated you because he said so - fuck, I even talked to Homeless Homer as I wandered down the street looking for someone to talk to - they would help you the moment you say you need it. You\u2019d be on the receiving end of unexpected compassion and unconditional kindness from people who barely know you. Homeless Homer told me, \u201cIt\u2019s not true love when you feel afraid.\u201d \n\nGo back to the people who have known and loved you for years. You don\u2019t have to explain anything, they\u2019re just waiting for you to come back. They\u2019d love you in ways that are familiar yet foreight, because he\u2019d keep you apart from them for so long that you don\u2019t know how to receive love anymore. \n\nFind a mental health professional, the kind that knows about trauma, the kind that can define what true love means in a healthy relationship, the kind that can help you come up with a safety plan.\n\nGo back to the people who give you a reason to live, a reason to not touch a wine or Vicodin bottle. Ask them to help you sneak your things out from his house, one bag at a time, until one day all you need is to rescue yourself.\n\nPlease enjoy your family and friends\u2019 company at the fullest. Fill your heart with love and contentment. Take plenty of progress pictures. Write a journal with your dreams, hopes, and aspirations. Make videos. Carve the happy, blissful, loving memories in your mind. Remember who you are at this moment. Remember why he loved you, because that\u2019s who you are and that\u2019s what makes you beautiful. \n\nGood luck.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It had a trigger warning, and it did just that. I was raised by a narcissistic mom, so I have been doing a LOT of healing the last several weeks because I have been finally attempting no contact, and with that comes childhood memories of neglect and abuse to validate my decision. \n\nI always knew my older brother had looked at me sexually when I was about 7. He was 5 years older. When I was about 8-10 years old, I could (for my whole life) recall a time where we played naked. He was just around pubescence, from what I remember, so the ages can be give or take a little.\n\nWe would \"make mixed drinks\" to play pretend with alcohol and he would act like a pimp, and me obviously being the girl. We would lay naked, in broad daylight, in the living room when we knew our parents were gone. As far as I know, that's the extent of it. \n\nBut when I read a post the other day, I had a very vivid flashback to which I now remember as being true. \n\nIt was in our bonus room, to which we had a mattress and box spring on the floor. I guess my eldest brother slept there? I don't really remember. I remember the lighting, the color of the walls, and that my little brother was there. He was probably 5-6. \n\nWe were all on the bed, just playing or something, when my older brother showed me the tip of his penis and ask that I kiss it. He was erect... He was pubescent... So I did, we all laughed. I think it proceeded to kissing longer increments of time, to licking, etc. It moved to like, the other parts of his penis, like touching his testicles or whatever. All while my little brother cackled as if it was just a big joke. He also \"dared\" me to do it to my little brother, and I did, and it makes my stomach turn, it's embarrassing, and I don't think he remembers that, but I was too young, around 8, to know what was actually going on. Being raised with brothers, I just thought it was a funny guy thing to do. I now can recognize that as abuse and I perhaps abused my little brother? But I didn't know it was bad at the time. I have no idea. I don't know much about sexual abuse at all. \n\nI am just remembering this as of yesterday. I told my significant other, and I turned white as a ghost, but didn't cry. I just couldn't speak, I was in disbelief I actually remembered in detail what happened. He decided he was disowning them completely, not that they even speak much anyways. I don't really associate with my brothers anymore, though me and the younger were closer growing up than the elder.\n\nI recall my mom, when I was about 17, ask me if my older brother ever sexually abused me. I remember saying no, but having a feeling that I was lying somehow. With a narcisstic parent, I didn't want to be seen as crazy if I said, \"well, maybe? I can't remember\". \n\nWhat is the next step? I'm not currently in therapy, but this was a really big reveal to my mental health and it explains a LOT of why I have adjusted to certain things the way I have. I hope I'm using appropriate language and not invalidating anything with sexual abuse. Any concerns or advice are welcome, I appreciate anyone who has read all of this and I hope it has not opened any dark places.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

It\u2019s all been confusing, \n\nI found that our arguments were always over the same things. His lack of affection, his lies, why he wouldn\u2019t fully commit to me. Why he only introduced me as his friend to anyone we met. He got mad at me for being clingy or suspicious of him cheating or talking to other women \u201che was btw\u201d.  The first few months of our relationship were great. What followed was a nightmare. \n\nHe would always throw my insecurities back in my face when I would bring up anything having to do with him.  I was too needy, clingy. I was too quiet or socially awkward. I was paranoid and crazy, Regardless of the evidence I threw in his face. He said I Didn\u2019t have enough confidence, that I Didn\u2019t talk much. I stopped talking about anything having to do with me because he would always change the subject or not even acknowledge it.  I had some small bit of confidence until I met him. He reduced me to nothing. He hated talking about feelings and emotions and whenever I tried he would shoot me down or get angry. \n\nAbout 3 months in I tried having the talk with him about us. He told me he was in his prime and could have anyone he wanted. That he was \u201cshallow\u201d. Me being a bigger girl wasn\u2019t his favorite. [yet the girl he is now with is bigger than me...go figure ] I always felt like I wasn\u2019t good enough and guilty for wanting affection. He would tell me he wasn\u2019t an affectionate guy and that was what killed his first marriage. He always said he would try harder. He never did. \n\nTowards the end we had a Major blowup on Christmas Eve. He was very drunk and accused me of stealing money from him that I told him I found on the floor.  Hilarious considering all I ever did was give him money or help when he needed it. This was the first time I saw him angry. Almost violent. He was throwing things around and getting in my face. He started asking if I was on drugs because I was having a panic attack. He was comparing me to his ex wife. His anger and aggression were mirroring an old relationship that had traumatized me far before he did. So I panicked. I told him that night I was done, I was out of there. He dropped to his knees sobbing. The most emotion I had ever seen from him in the year we had been dating. He begged me not to leave like everyone else. He was hugging me and kissing my cheeks, stroking my hair begging me not to go. Sucking me right back in. I went all out for him and his son on Christmas. I made dinner, provided all the present cuz he was broke. I even got him some things he had been really wanting. I of course got nothing. \n\nAfter that he was wanting to spend less\nTime with me. Lied about where he was, who he was with. He was seeing his new supply behind my back. I was provoking fights on purpose just to see if he might have any care for me at all. He said he loved me, but never meant it. One night when I was a ball of tears in his living room he was laughing about it telling me I should see myself. He said he was going to record it so I could watch it later and see how pathetic I was being. \n\nWhen I watched his son for his bday weekend, he was out with his new supply when I thought he was digging his friend out of snow in the mountains. He finally brutally discarded me at the end of March. I never got to see his son. The last words I said to him were \u201cI love you buddy, have fun on your trip and I\u2019ll see you when you get back.\u201d That haunts me to this day. This 5 year old kid probably thinks I dipped out like his mom. He called me mom for God\u2019s sake. His dad didn\u2019t care. I\u2019m traumatized by the whole thing and I\u2019m so stuck that I know I need therapy to work through this but I\u2019m scared. The one time I tried was a couple weeks after it all happened and I was just a blubbering mess in the office. I felt so stupid.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It feels like the reaction of \"don't tell them anything at all\" is disproportionately large compared to what they're doing (or rather, what we think they're doing). If I\u2019m only seeing \u201cred flags\u201d, then they probably haven\u2019t done anything hugely terrible yet. So I\u2019m not sure how to handle this dissonance because it feels like I\u2019m being \u201cunfair\u201d by gray-rocking based on red flags only.\n\nImagine two scenarios (I've purposely made them a bit blunt/extreme to make a point):\n\nScenario A: someone asks you about your weekend, and you decide right then and there that you're gray-rocking them.\n\nScenario B: someone asks you about your weekend, and then over time slowly uses these little pieces of information against you. The key is that they do it slowly and very very gradually. Eventually they're making you feel uncomfortable and just generally bad about yourself. So you gray-rock them.\n\nWhen it comes to non-narcissists, Scenario A seems a little extreme. The other person didn't do anything other than ask about your weekend, so to instantly gray-rock them seems like an extreme reaction. With Scenario B, you know that the little pieces of information you give to a narcissist will come back and around and be used against you. Because of this, you gray-rock them. BUT in your mind you may be still thinking that you're in Scenario A. The narcissist is so subtle and careful about how they belittle you, that when you look around you, you feel that you're still in Scenario A and that you're over-reacting. But really you're in Scenario B.\n\nSo that's why it feels weird to gray-rock a covert narcissist sometimes. Because the things they do are so subtle that you feel like you're being extreme by drawing such strong boundaries and not even giving them the time of day. But you know better and you know that this is exactly how they get past your boundaries. Slowly and gradually.\n\nHow do I become internally okay with this feeling of dissonance of \"what it looks like they're doing\" vs \"my reaction to it\". Maybe I need a more confident understanding that the things they're doing in Scenario B will definitely lead to bad things so that I know my gray-rock reaction is not extreme but appropriate to what they are doing. I suppose this is where \"red flags\" even come from. The little things you notice are indicators of bigger things. But it still feels like I\u2019m being overly harsh by gray-rocking just because I\u2019m seeing red flags. The thing is, I know that if I don\u2019t gray-rock now, it\u2019ll just get worse and worse. They are never going to do that \u201cbig thing\u201d that is easy to point out and say \u201cThat there is why I am gray-rocking, so my actions are justified\u201d. They just gradually push boundaries more and more until it\u2019s too late. \n\nSo how do I internalize the fact that it is okay to gray-rock based on just red flags / on the little things I\u2019m seeing? Deep down I know I\u2019m right and that they\u2019re a narcissist, but a part of me keeps worrying I\u2019m being too harsh / not giving them a chance, etc. Which any third-party observer would say is insane because they\u2019ve already crossed many small boundaries and shown plenty of signs of being a narcissist.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

longtime lurker, first time poster. i\u2019m sorry for the length and it kinda being all over the place, but thank you for reading.  \n\nTLDR at the bottom \n\nhi, i\u2019m a 17 year old female living in the USA. i turn 18 in a few months. my family situation is a bit complicated and i\u2019m not sure of my options but i\u2019m looking for a way out. in my household, it\u2019s me, my brother (8y/o), my mom, and my dad. my dad is an abusive alcoholic who\u2019s been this way for years. \n\ni have endured mental, emotional, and physical abuse from my dad for most of my life. my brother gets none. my mom gets the worst of it. she is a victim of direct domestic abuse. he has hit her, constantly insults her and berates her, but also pretty much depends on her for everything. he does not love her. she does not love him. he cannot hold a normal conversation without yelling. he is the one who is always right, no matter what his opinions are. he knows everything and is the smartest in the room. this is the way he has been for the entirety of the past 18 years. it's unbearable.  \n\nmy parents are both immigrants from europe, and so english is their second language. in turn, my mom basically does everything for my dad. she pays the bills, talks on the phone, cleans the house, cooks, does laundry, and anything else you can think of. she also has two full time jobs. my dad does nothing at home. he has a job but it\u2019s currently part time. however, he makes his schedule, meaning he could totally leave and go work if he wanted to, he just chooses to go out with friends all day and drink when he gets home.  \n\nduring the day when im not at school, i have to be stuck at home with my little brother because he can't be alone and my dad has \"work.\" he doesn't have work. he literally goes out to bars to gossip and watch TV and eat. this is his excuse for everything. he has \"work.\" i'm essentially a stay at home babysitter, helping my brother with his homework and making sure he's safe and whatnot. if i want to go out somewhere or do something, i usually have to take my brother along. i love my brother, i don't have a problem with it. i do, however, have a problem with what my dad does.  \n\nduring the weekends when my dad is still home and there is someone to watch my brother, i go to work. if i could, i would work everyday, but i can only work weekends. yet, my dad has the audacity to complain to me how i could be working more and getting paid more. i consistently always bring up the fact that i'm supposed to be home to watch my brother while he's away. he has no response and just changes the subject. no matter how much i push it, he always has this superior thought. it's ridiculous.  \n\neven with all this, he tries to control my mom and everything she does. he constantly calls her all day to see what she\u2019s doing and where she is, he buys things irresponsibly and gives no thought to saving money, and he uses credit cards when i know for a fact he has racked up so much debt, both in his name and my mom\u2019s. i\u2019m going to be applying for college this year, and i\u2019ve brought it up to my parents. i know they don\u2019t have anything saved for me, yet they\u2019re out spending money like they have it. we are currently set to go back to the home country for about a month to visit family but also go on vacations (aka just go to places that my dad wants to go to), which just means more money will be spent. this is their second or third vacation this year, it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t take any. when asked, my dad\u2019s excuse was, \u201coh the kids NEED to see the country.\u201d (we go back almost every year.)  \n\nmy dad constantly gets into fights or arguments with everyone around him. this often goes on with his own family (my grandparents and my uncle.) there is some family drama between them, but his family knows what type of person he is in the sense of abusive. they haven't done anything about it. my mom's family, (my other grandparents and uncle) also know what kind of person he is, but they aren't \"allowed\" to do anything about it. my dad hates my mom's family, even going as far as to accuse my great grandma and grandma of being witches and cursing him. at this point, my grandma is just straight up scared of my dad and what he will do. whenever he's unhappy, he just takes it out on my mom.  \n\ni've tried talking to my mom about all this. she says she's looked into her options, and she would divorce if she could, but it is expensive. my dad would most certainly not willingly divorce, and she said it costs more money if it's a forceful divorce. i've told her that i would help her, my grandparents would help her, her brother would help her, she has an entire help and support system right here. she simply doesn't want to ask for help. i know she's scared and not ready. because of this, she has developed a drinking problem. it's not terrible, but it's enough to make me worry. i've tried confronting her about it, she won't have any of it. in our family and the culture that we have, drinking isn't seen as such a big deal. she also has this \"belief\" where if she doesn't overcome her obstacles in this life, she'll have to face them in the next life and with this, now thinks that she has to stay with my dad so she doesn't be with him in her next life. while i think it's great that my mom has something to believe in to keep her going, this is going to tear her apart. her life is beyond stressful, she isn't happy and we all know it.  \n\nmy family all live in the home country in europe, which is why it isn't easy for one of them to just take us in. i've discussed calling the police with my grandma the next time it gets bad, and my grandma thinks i should do it. he is an awful person, and i don't think i would have any regrets doing so. once i call though, there's no going back. i know things in our family would never be the same. i just want him out of my life. i haven't called any domestic shelters or the hotline, and i know i probably should, but we're leaving for this trip on Monday and i'm dreading it. i know if the situation gets bad in the country, i can just ask my uncle to pick me up, but that's also a big deal in my dad's eyes. he would see it as a betrayal of leaving the family behind. my dad already sees me as \"on my mom's side\" because i defend her when he tries attacking. if i were to leave, i wouldn't want to go back. he is absolutely toxic and i don't know what to do. i don't want to spend the next 4 weeks with him like this.  \n\ni've told my boyfriend who i trust very much, and he has already offered to help me. i appreciate it, but it would most likely get his parents involved, and while i know they would be completely accepting, helpful, and amazing, it is a lot to ask for my specific situation and i don't know.  \n\ni could give so many examples of how awful it is living at home with my dad, but i'm not going to because this is already so long. i'm not sure what to do, or if i even should do anything. i only have a year left before i graduate high school and leave for college. i'm already planning on moving out as soon as possible, but i'm not sure if i should stick it out and use college as my way out or try doing something now. my grandma says i should look out for myself, but i don't know where to go from here.  \n\nTLDR: my father is emotionally, physically, and mentally abusive. my grandma from my mom's side of the family thinks i should call the police or some hotline next time he has one of his episodes, but i'm afraid of what might happen after that to the rest of my family. i'm not sure what to do.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

We played and got along and I really looked up to him. When I was about 15, my parents got divorced. They had fallen out of love for each other. My mom wanted to remain friends, but my dad blamed her. \r\nMy dad took up drinking shortly after their divorce, started staying out really late, and hooked up with a pretty toxic person for a bit. Me and my sister, 2 years younger than me, grew closer throughout all the chaos and craziness that happened when they split. We spent a lot of our time in a spare \u2018hang out\u2019 room of sorts, talking and watching television. I remember never feeling completely comfortable when at my dads house, and me and my sister stayed in this room most of the time partly because we were teenagers and wanted space like all our friends, and partly because we were intimidated by what our dad was becoming. \r\nSoon, that discomfort turned to fear as our dad started acting weird and occasionally blowing up at us after he went out drinking. \r\nThe worst time I can remember clearly. My grandma was over and we were watching a movie, and my dad got up to get a snack. He had been out for a while drinking with his friends. \r\nI got a text from my mom asking me to call her to check how I was doing, so I checked with my grandma to see if it was alright, which she said it was. The divorce was still relatively new and we were still adjusting to not seeing the other parent for a week, and I was missing my mom. (At this point I was closer with her than with my dad). \r\nI finished my call and returned to keep watching the movie. \r\nMy dad\u2019s figure appears in the doorway, where he stands still for at least a solid minute, just looking at me. I didn\u2019t know what he was doing, but I immediately knew something was wrong. I got more and more scared as he stood there, until he blew up and got mad at me for calling my mom. I apologized, explaining that I missed her and the movie was paused so I thought it was ok. Instead of letting up, he continued to berate me until I was sobbing from the shame he had made me feel, begging to go to my room to cry in private. He eventually allowed it, but as I was up there started yelling at me again about how I shouldn\u2019t have called my mom because it was his week. I was hurting from the divorce and just wanted him to understand that, but he kept repeating himself, making me apologize over and over. I was getting a headache from crying by the time he went outside to go smoke a cigarette. My grandma asked me to come downstairs to her, but I was too scared. \r\nThe next morning he didn\u2019t say sorry, didn\u2019t acknowledge what he did. It was almost like it never happened. This kept happening over and over for two more years. I\u2019m now 17, and I thought things were getting better. I thought he wasn\u2019t drinking as much, and he seemed to have a slightly better relationship with my mom. \r\nThat was until he came home two hours later than he said he would tonight, and in the redness of his eyes and lateness of his reaction I could tell he was drunk. Me and my sister knew these signs and mentally prepared ourselves for another episode.\r\nWhen he sat down and was quiet for a while, staring at us, I knew  he was about to erupt again. He accused us of \u2018not giving a shit\u2019 about him because we had watched stranger things 3 with our mom instead of him. He had given us the impression that he was ok with us doing just that, however, so we were confused. But instead of voicing our thoughts, he apologized over and over because we learned that that\u2019s the only way to keep it from escalating. \r\nIs this emotional abuse? We dread going to our dads house, and I often have to go to bed early in fear that he\u2019ll blow up after drinking. If he\u2019s even quiet for a little while I feel that familiar fear of him being about to make us feel terrible. Is there something we\u2019re not doing? It just doesn\u2019t seem healthy to have to lie to keep things calm. \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s some other things he has done:\r\n\u2022\tGets upset when I need alone time, as if I\u2019m slighting him\r\n\u2022\tExpecting us to share his opinions about things, especially about the divorce/my mom\r\n\u2022\tWhen I provide examples of when he\u2019s made me feel unsafe or unable to speak my mind, he dismisses it if I can\u2019t give his a specific date or time\r\n\u2022\tGuilt-tripping us into pitying him or apologizing for things we don\u2019t need to apologize for\r\n\u2022\tAccused our mom of manipulating me when I had a different opinion than him\r\n\u2022\tBrushing off the fact that we\u2019ve had a hard time with the divorce too, and it\u2019s not just him who suffered from it\r\n\u2022\tMaking himself the victim\r\n\u2022\tAccusing us of being too sensitive about things he says, then blows up over comments he perceives to be attacks. One time he blew up over my sister making a joke that the cutting board was always in the sink. \r\n\u2022\tSaying we are selfish, cruel, heartless, corrupted, and that we are so weak-minded that we can\u2019t tell what\u2019s our own thoughts and what our mother is \u2018forcing us to believe\u2019.

I would actively fight him while he was forcing himself on me.

I was very young and honestly afraid. I eventually got up the nerve to breakup with him and it felt like the world was off my shoulders.\n\nIn college I didn't have any negative experiences with men and had healthy relationships, I had a healthy and happy sex life. Until one night I decided to sleep with a particular \"friend\". After a few minutes he was antagonistic and started pressuring me for sexual favors. I resisted and said stop once. After that I was terrified. I felt so helpless. I had known this guy for 3 years and suddenly it felt like he was a monster and I couldn't control my own body. He kept coming back for more several times and I don't understand how he thought I was consenting. My memory of everything is incredibly hazy even though I was completely sober. I hated. Every. Second. I felt helpless and I don't know why I couldn't stop it. Is it normal for men to be overly dominant/aggressive with someone you have never had sex with before? I had told him prior to this happening that it takes me a while to be comfortable with sex. I recently reached out to his ex gf and she told me he was \"obsessed\" with \"dominating\". That sometimes she wished it to just be over, or that she can't tell if she actually wanted to do all those things or if she just wanted to feel desirable.\n\nI know I haven't given many details but this is painful for me to write, was this my fault?

In the beginning it was an hour (guess which one of us was driving every single weekend to see the other), but by year 2 we were a flight away.\n\nOnce we were in the \u2018one flight away\u2019 territory, a really weird pattern emerged. My ex would pick me up from the airport and would immediately be visibly upset with me, as though I had betrayed his trust or something. We could be texting beforehand with excitement, virtual screaming about how both of us are so excited to see each other. Think along the lines of \u201cARE YOU HERE??\u201d \u201cJUST LANDED\u201d \u201c!!!!!!!\u201d. Every time I imagined seeing him, I imagined the sort of reunion you\u2019d expect to see in movies, with running and a giant hug and a kiss and rocking back and forth... but that never, ever happened. (And there were a LOT of flights.) We would hug, but it was painfully awkward, and his smile was completely forced (dead eyed). Nearing the car he\u2019d try to kiss me; hands all over me was the first thing once we were IN the car... but still with this air of suspicion and upset on his part, no smiles or anything. It felt really weird to be leaping into physical affection while he\u2019s clearly in a mood. He\u2019d stay in the mood for an entire day or sometimes two.\n\nIt got to the point where I confronted him about it, and at first he tried to deny that he was in any kind of mood but eventually he said he didn\u2019t know why he was upset (but confirmed that he was). I begged him to try not to come off that way because it made me feel awful and set us off to a bad start every time (and was a huge letdown for me because I was so. effing. excited. to see him). I even asked him to pretend to be excited to see me, but he really just couldn\u2019t. \n\nIt confused me so much at the time. I hadn\u2019t even thought about it since we broke up.

And then after i said i didnt want a massage he proceeds to touch my legs through my blankets and after i keep saying no, he pulls up the covers and starts massaging my bare legs up until hes literally lifting my shorts to get as high as he can, like right by my butt.

I call one of my friends (not the one that made me cry hehe) and tell her what happened, and about an hour later my step dad comes back and keeps asking if i want a massage and i kicked him out cause i was fully awake this time.\n\nSorry for the long explanation this is my first reddit post and first time ive ever experienced something like this, what do you guys think about this?

For the time being, Grayson. I recently shared a story about his dad on another sub, and I felt like following it up with what my relationship entailed with his son in a different/correct sub. This is my emotional abuse story that spanned over a year and two months. \n\nWhen I first met the boy, I was with one of my friends after school waiting for my mom to pick me up from school. My friend was a skate-boarder, and I was not. He had me on his skateboard, and I was squealing about how scared I was, but my friend kept insisting that I should keep trying. Grayson was waiting for his dad to pick him up as well. He didn't say anything to me in person that day, but he did text me on Instagram, a DM, saying I was adorable. I thought it was sweet so I pursued the relationship.\n\nWe moved fairly fast. I went on one date with him to the movies. It became apparent to me that he was a very touchy person. I remember him touching my thighs, and trying to touch me inappropriately in the theater. I was uncomfortable, because I was a virgin and hesitant to do anything with anyone because I always feared being used and left, and I'm an emotional person, and I didn't want an emotional bond to someone who didn't feel the same way. But I let it happen, in spite of my anxiety.\n\nOne red flag, that I should have noticed at first: We were at the homecoming football game. We sat next to each other, while his friends whooped at him for having a girlfriend. Typical for high school boys. The game was fun. Until his ex-girlfriend came up to us. Now, she was very spiteful that we started dating. She would comment sarcastic comments on his Instagram and I had asked him about it. She feigned support, but in a condescending way. She climbed the bleachers and got in my face, and said \"Do you know who I am?\" and I said, \"No.\" \"Well I'm his ex-girlfriend, and he always talks about how pretty you are but now I know that's not true.\" She walked away, but came back and kept continuing with the rude remarks, and an argument ensued. Grayson just sat in silence with his head hanging down, and did not speak up. Did not defend me. Just let her continue to lash into me and pretend he wasn't there. I left the game crying that night.\n\n\\[sometime later in our relationship, he admitted to cheating on her. He had came to see her with hickeys on his neck.\\]\n\nTwo weeks later, we were going to homecoming together. We were dating some time in between then and homecoming. Our relationship was already rocky. It became apparent to me he had trust issues. I wish I had backed out before it got as bad as it did.\n\nHe began to get jealous, if I looked at someone of the opposite sex for no more than a few seconds, or if I had friends that were boys. I asked him about it. There were rumors about me. One so ridiculous that he believed that I had a train run on me while I was in middle school. While some of these, I had confirmed: so many were untrue.\n\nYou see, when I was in middle school, I was going through a lot. My parents had divorced and it took an emotional toll on me. I also was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in the seventh grade, and I had self-harmed frequently. In the eighth grade, I had sent my first explicit photo to someone. I wasn't getting a lot of attention at home, as my sister had several mood disorders and was beginning to rebel; so she required a lot more attention. I kept sending them. I was getting attention, and that's all I saw it as. Nothing more. I regret that to this day in spite of being out of school.\n\nGrayson began to hold this over my head. He validated these rumors because a lot of those guys were familiar with how I was then. This was the main excuse for how he treated me. If so much as a guy friend wanted to come and give me a hug, just to be friendly, he'd glare at me, and once they walked away, he'd accuse me of doing sexual things with them. A friend of mine waved at me while I was sitting with him. I waved back. The same thing happened. I felt like his excuses were valid enough to make me feel guilty. I remember him one night, so angry at me that he had demanded I named every guy that I had sent pictures to. He held that number over my head, no matter if I was right or wrong in an argument. If he was upset that day. Anything.\n\nHe had a number of female friends. And it became very clear to me that it wasn't a typical friendship. I watched as he would hug on other girls, text them while he was with me, and even walk other girls to class. It made me uncomfortable, especially where he had such a control over me. I brought it up to him. It didn't matter, because he called me a whore, a slut, a hoe, a bitch, anything in the book; and he felt like it was justified. At one point, he and I even compromised at one point that he wouldn't talk to girls so I wouldn't talk to guys. He never kept that promise. Countless times had I heard from underclassmen: Grayson did this.. Grayson did that.\n\nIt didn't really hit me until I was so upset in class one day. I was talking to a girl about our problems. Grayson had been out for having pneumonia. A group of girls turned around and told me they had to tell me something. In his gym class, he'd been caught smacking another girls ass. He had been caught going up to another girl and grabbing her hips and acting like he was thrusting into her. I broke things off with him that day, because he had denied it. But I knew it was true. I knew a lot of the things were true that were said, and he had broken our promise. He said that he loved those girls like they were his sisters, but to me that wasn't a valid excuse to do the things he did.\n\nHe admitted to it, then apologized. I should have never took him back but I did. It only got worse. It felt like we would break up then get together countless times.\n\nAround six months of us; he began demanding more sexual favors. He got upset that I hadn't had sex with him yet. I was shocked. He told me that I OWE him, and that it was unfair because I did other things with my first boyfriend in high school and we weren't together \\*THAT\\* long... I liked to think I was more na\u00efve my freshman year, but I hadn't changed, really. Because I did give him my virginity. I was uncomfortable, and I just wanted to get it over with. While we were having sex, inside my heart was breaking. \n\nThis was when the sexual control came into play. He did not want anything to do with me unless my clothes were off. I would ask him why he couldn't just see me and enjoy spending time with me and not think about sex all the time. Again, he always won arguments, and he always got his way: because of the things I had done in middle school. \n\nAbout a year into our relationship, this began to affect us a lot. He began to withdraw, and would only want to talk if I was willing to sext him, or be with him, having sex with him. Any other time, he was indulged in video games. I was really upset one night. I had no one else to talk to but him. I had no friends while being with him. Any of the friends I had that were girls, he didn't like because they were \"bad influences\" but the most they did was chase after boys and smoke pot every now and then. So I only had him, and he decided he didn't want to talk to me when I was upset. He would make it a point, and told me several times that I was crazy, and until I calmed down he wasn't talking to me. He would force me to hold everything in. He didn't like if I talked to my parents about what was going on because he told me that he felt like I wanted my parents to hate him, even if I was telling them the honest truth about what he was doing to me. He knew it was wrong and he continued to do it anyway.\n\nNow about my parents. They were aware what was going on. I knew I didn't deserve it. They never knew to the extent about the sexting, the sex. They just knew he treated me badly. They were the first few people in my life who had told me I needed to end this relationship. I always made excuses. I didn't think it was abuse. I thought it was all validated, and I had deserved it. \n\nHe had decided one night I was too annoying to deal with. We frequently argued. And it all ended the same way: \n\n\"You're a slut, I heard you did this, and you didn't think about telling me? Why didn't you tell me? Are you stupid? Did you not think I would find out?\" -- Even if I had genuinely forgotten, or if I truly never done any of the things he accused me of, he never once believed me. \n\nSometimes, if we were together he'd purposely set me up to accuse me of something. He'd even push his hand or his ear to my chest to feel my heart race. He knew what he was doing. And having anxiety, it always scared me.\n\nHe always believed I was hiding something and would dig, and even though I'd cry and beg for him to stop, he never would let up. It hurt. I cried every night.\n\nAnd the reason we even argued in the first place? I just wanted to FaceTime him... and that night he had broken things off with me.\n\nI spent the night so distraught I cried until my eyes were burning red and swollen. I cried all the time. It hurt so bad. I had done so much in my life to change my ways, to prove I was worthy enough for him. In all of that mess, I had relapsed, I had begged for him back. I told him I truly felt alone. He hadn't cared, or at least acted like he didn't.\n\nAfter I had come to terms with us breaking up, I fell into a bad spell of depression. I began to contemplate suicide. I told him because he was all I had. Or I felt like all I had. He had told me: \"Well don't do it now because everyone would blame me for it.\" \n\nBy some \"miracle\" we ended up back together. Or at least, we were trying to get back together. We met up one day. On one condition. I let him do whatever he wanted to me. At that point, my self esteem was so battered I took that chance. His dad had roped us into going to his grandpa's house. I had fun. He was disappointed and blamed me for not being able to have a quickie before we went. But we talked outside, under the stars. He said he'd change. He said he loved me. We sat outside for a long time. He went inside and I stayed inside. It was like a sign from God that I wasn't meant to be with him because when things started feeling okay-- they weren't. In the time I had spent going through a mental breakdown.. he had been sexting other girls. He was single. But in my mind I knew eventually he'd decide he'd get bored and want to get with me again. But hearing that hurt. A girl from school had told me. \n\nIt was a direct message. I went inside, no words. Walked past his dad, his grandpa, to him, and just showed him the message, tears streaming down my face. He just shook his head and acted like he didn't know what she was talking about. But in my heart, I just knew. I went back outside and cried it out. I went back inside. Grayson locked himself in the bathroom. I knew he was deleting the proof. I waited outside the bathroom. As soon as he opened the door, I raised my fists like I was going to hit him. He caught them. And he held them, with a bewildered look on his face. I fell to the ground. I cried, and I cried. I don't think I was more hurt in my life than I was in that moment.\n\nEvery bad thing he had done to me, to make me feel like I was garbage ran through my head. He finally got me up, and walked me outside to his dad's car. We left, and his dad tried to offer some run-of-the-mill relationship advice; but we both just looked out the windows of our respective sides and didn't say a word. He walked me to my door, and we departed. He gave me a hug, all while denying the things that were said. \n\nBut I knew it was true. And other people knew as well but hadn't spoken up until they saw I was emotionally affected. The girl he was sexting was sleeping over at my friend's house. She had even showed her his nudes. Another had screen shotted him telling that girl to pretend it never happened to tell me it didn't. I took it upon myself to ask he what had happened and she got angry at me. But the screen shot and a verbal agreement was all that I really needed. \n\nAgain, we did the same thing. He admitted to it and apologized, but then defended himself by saying he was single and genuinely thought he wanted nothing to do with me. I began to have bad dreams. I began crying a lot more. I began to isolate myself from my friends, from my family. I just felt obligated to stay with him.. and I regret that. Anytime from then on, he had seen the cuts on my legs. He was angry at me, and told me I had missed a spot. He often remarked that my cuts looked like Tic-Tac-Toe. It started to feel like he wanted me to feel miserable.\n\nAnytime I would open up to him about my feelings regarding what had happened, at first he was compliant. Then it was again.. aggressively ignoring me, telling me to get over it, get over myself, because ***I had done worse things than he ever has.*** \n\nI eventually had enough. The very last straw for me was wanting.. again just to call him.. just to say goodnight, and that I loved him. I called him so many times, just to be ignored.. I was at this point, clinging onto something I thought made me happy. When he finally answered, I was crying. He hung up immediately. He said I was too clingy, that I was crazy, and that I needed to get over him spending time away from me. But I just wanted to say goodnight..\n\nI made up my mind. Whenever we finally connected again on FaceTime, I told him it was over. That *we* were over. He just laughed.\n\nBut once I had shown him I meant it, he began to come up to me more at school. He began following me to class. He would glare at me in the hallways if a guy so much came up to me to say hello, and sometimes walking by my class and peering in the glass window to look at me. I never noticed it until someone pointed him out. I felt helpless. It got bad enough that I had even told my teacher that class that we had broken up, and that he was following me to class. She would make him leave. I confided in her about us. She was so understanding, such a sweet woman. I'll never forget her, and I will always appreciate her for listening to me hurting.\n\nThe last time I spoke to him regarding our relationship was in person. We agreed to meet in the long hallway at school after school just to talk. As soon as I came up to him, he was pitiful. He wanted to hug me, kiss me. When I told him it was over, he started crying. He got upset. He began trying to make me feel small. We began to argue about what had happened. The only things I remember being said: \"Well maybe if you didn't decide to do the things you've done to me, we wouldn't be in this situation..\" He got in my face, and cornered me by the wall and said, \"*Well at least I know who's seen me naked*.\" \n\nAnger filled me, like absolute rage. I will never brag about this ever, because advocating domestic violence is not okay. I hadn't thought even for a split second. I reeled back my arm and slapped him across the face. It felt like it went in slow motion. Immediate regret. I picked up my bag and walked away, and he was on my heels. He grabbed me by my shoulder and turned me around and shoved me against the lockers and said \"you're lucky I don't hit girls.\" He walked away, my handprint on the side of his face, and walked to practice.\n\nI got in the car and told my mom. I laugh looking back on it because, she just looked at me and smiled and said \"It felt good though, didn't it?\" And while I did feel guilty, it felt like a weight has been lifted off of my shoulders, like I had been liberated.\n\n\\--\n\nBecause of this, I had a lot of things to work through. I always felt guilty for talking to guys. I felt guilty for getting over him by getting under someone else. I felt guilty for indulging in my desires that weren't up to his approval when we dated. I was depressed. In all, it took me two years to finally come to terms and to feel comfortable in my own skin. I re-connected with some of my friends. A lot of them disassociated with me because they felt like I ghosted them on my terms, to be with him. \n\nI am much happier now. Three years after building up the courage to leave-- I am in love with someone else. Someone who makes me feel so important and loved, like I'm the only girl in the room. Who does things when I am comfortable, and does not ever pressure me into doing things I don't want. He doesn't ask me about my past, and he doesn't make me cry every night. Someone I trust, and someone I truly love who never lets me doubt that those feelings are unrequited. Leaving him opened so many doors in my life that were slammed shut in my face and locked before. I love someone else. He treats me better than Grayson ever could have. And I'm never shut down for talking about feeling sad, or if I'm upset, even if he were to be the reason. He lets me communicate with him, and that was something that would have surely been lost.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Last time we spoke, he flipped with accusations and name calling - basically, he went on on blaming me for a lot of things, and when I tried to explain he said I was always trying to play the victim, said I was egocentric and finished with \"fuck off, bitch\" and \"get out of my life\" - literally a few sentences after saying he would always love me.\n\nI obviously did cut contact and erased and deleted his number, email and any form of contact to prevent me from getting in touch again.\n\nTwo days ago, on my birthday, he texted me his wishes of happy birthday, as well as that he wishes me \"the gift to forgive\". That he thinks of me constantly etc.\n\nI haven't answered. Most of the times I feel like I shall not answer, as I know the crazy loops of anger that any contact can take. Yet sometimes a part of me feels like answering and restablishing contact, mainly because I still feel very sad and hurt. At these moments, in my mind I would be able to tell how I fell, he would apologise and things would get better. Yet I know that this is not how it goes (let me point out that he hasn't even apologised per se other than wishing me the gift of forgiving), so I am turning to you for support.

You changed my life, you changed the way I look at things, you gave me so many incredible highs where I felt so loved and so many lows that made me question everything. Our relationship was never healthy. You chose me because you knew I was lonely and it would be easy enough to get me to dedicate myself to you and I latched onto you because you made me feel needed. I am honestly not sure if you ever really loved me or if you just used me to get by and that hurts more than anything. I can\u2019t even act surprised by this after all the times you watched me cry with no emotion on your face telling me you didn\u2019t care. I am embarrassed about all of the times I literally begged for you to care. No matter what I did it, it was never going to change. No matter how many times I tried to make up for something I did wrong, it was never going to be enough. No matter how many times you hurt me, I was always going to end up being the one apologizing. I don\u2019t think there are many people in this world that get to see that cold side of you, so I guess in that sense I was special. I feel ashamed to talk to my family about any of this because then I would have to admit that I accommodated someone who could so easily hurt me.  \n\nIt is hard for me not to feel like I lost my best friend.

You may have found temporary happiness, and you probably feel good thinking about all the things this new person can do for you. But I know you and I know that every day you will still wake up feeling insecure, feeling like no one really understands you.

I couldnt take it anymore and i decided to tell him that i will not put up with that kind of behaviour anymore.  I was pleasantly suprised by the way he had  reacted.

I go to work like a walking dead. \n\nAfter that he calls me everyday to come at his place to sleep but i was so tired from work that i couldnt make it ,and to be honest I didnt want it cause i knew i wouldnt get any sleep there.\nAnd then he finally snaps.  He was working p.m shift and was done at midnight. I was free that day but had to work the a.m shift next day.

The only red flag occurred a few months ago when I saw he\u2019d gotten a message from a half naked girl. He ended up confessing he\u2019d used prostitutes in the past but promised that he\u2019d left that life behind him and that he has never cheated in a relationship. \n\nNow I\u2019ve been lied to and cheated on before so I was very cautious when I heard this but the way he spun the story he was just lonely and everything was so good that I just wanted to believe it. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, we\u2019re in the car together and I see he\u2019s recently typed in a seedy motel at a town nearby. He had an excuse that he accidentally typed that motel in but wanted to go to the store next to it (completely different names). Of course that makes absolutely no sense so I calmly stated that things weren\u2019t adding up. \n\nHe kept saying he couldn\u2019t do this, blamed me for not trusting him and told me that I needed to go. I said I wanted to stay and talk and eventually I got a half lie, half confession (he said he drove there but didn\u2019t go in) after telling him that I\u2019m not stupid and I can tell when I\u2019m being lied to. I also asked him to show me something on his phone that my friend showed me (frequented locations) and he didn\u2019t really know what that was so he did and it revealed that he\u2019d been to that motel half a dozen times and he\u2019d been to many others too. \n\nHe\u2019s been seeing them for months. I did recently tell him I was worried his past might become a problem and he tried to twist it around then too, saying he can\u2019t date someone that doesn\u2019t trust him. \n\nThe thing that gets me is I told him that I\u2019ve been lied to and gaslighted in the past and yet he did the same to me. He claims he has told his dad and his best friend and his dad who is also a gp is going to get him help. No idea if this is true though. \n\nHe tried to show me the scrapbook he was making for us as \u201cproof\u201d he really did care about me, but I told him if he gave me a scrapbook I would rip it up. \n\nThe thing that makes me sick is he has put me at risk of disease and even asked me to go on the pill so we didn\u2019t have to use condoms. I\u2019m going to get an sti test and I really hope everything is fine but I feel so dirty. \n\nThe other kicker is he slept with a hooker at lunch time, went home for a bit and then came to pick me up and was able to act like nothing at all happened. \n\nI feel disgusting, foolish, used and naive. I\u2019m at a loss as to why I seem to attract and/or accidentally \u201cchoose\u201d people like this.

I\u2019m probably overthinking but I just need to get it out. \n\n\nSo, I am still in contact with my nex (coparenting) but I have been gray rocking her for months and that has proven to be a very effective method. I will only discuss the kiddo, I am civil, but I do not make small talk or try to be friends. \n\nMy ex and I were together for four miserable years and we have been broken up for exactly 1 year now. After a particularly nasty fight in which she verbally abused me on my first Father\u2019s Day after my father had died just 3 months before, she decided to move to another state four hours away. She tried to come back several times (I said absolutely not), LOTS of hoovering in the beginning until I started consistently and religiously gray rocking her. She eventually stopped, save for the random drunk calls I would get where she professed her undying love \ud83d\ude44\n\nWithin the past year she has found a new partner and they plan to get married this December. They have not even known each other a full year. She moved the new partner into her apartment after 2 months. As time went on after they got together she eventually stopped trying to hoover me (great!). I have never met the new partner as she seems to hide from me during pickups/drop offs for the kiddo. I FaceTime the kiddo very regularly seeing as they live so far away now, and Kiddo will occasionally try to show me New Partner which I just kinda laugh at and go on. Nex told me that I make New Partner feel very awkward so I do try to avoid her during the pickups to be nice and not make her feel awkward or whatever. \n\nI was chatting with one of our mutual friends this weekend and I got such a good laugh. Apparently New Partner believes that I so obviously still have feelings for my Nex because I don\u2019t interact with her. Also she believes my Nex really needs to \u201ctalk to me about it.\u201d LOL I was like what?!? Seriously? \n\nNex has disrespected her relationship with New Partner by crossing the line with several inappropriate things she has said to me (and in which I shut down immediately), which I have screenshots of by the way.  Nex is not stupid enough to try to \u201ctalk to me\u201d about my supposed feelings for her because she knows what she\u2019s done, she knows I have screenshots, and she knows that I don\u2019t have feelings for her anymore whether she will openly admit it or not. \n\nOn one hand I kind of feel sorry for New Partner. Clearly the seeds of insecurity have already been planted and will only get worse from here. New Partner is about to go through absolute hell and I\u2019ve been there, it sucks. On the other hand, I\u2019ve never ever given any indication that I still have feelings for Nex. Im sure Nex is the one that gave her the idea to make her insecure. But it\u2019s just so ridiculous it\u2019s laughable. Like I legitimately started laughing when Mutual Friend told me that. I would have flat out blocked Nex if there was no child involved. I am SO SO SO much happier without her, I would never ever take her back. Ever. \n\nBut a part of me is very bothered and I can\u2019t work it out. I know I shouldn\u2019t be bothered, I know that, but I am. I shouldn\u2019t care what New Partner thinks of me but I can\u2019t stand the thought of people believing I\u2019m still pining for Nex, like it makes me look pathetic or something. And it makes me mad because it\u2019s not even true. I have been so proud of myself for shutting Nex down and rejecting her all the times that I have. It made me feel strong. It kickstarted my self esteem comeback. It was like well at least I have my pride and self worth to fall back on when things were really shitty. And New Partner is running around saying shit like this and it pisses me off. \n\nI still hate Nex. I know you\u2019re not supposed to hate people, but I do I\u2019m sorry. I can never forgive or forget the things she\u2019s done. I\u2019m also obviously bothered that I\u2019m being used to strengthen her hold on New Partner. But I also think New Partner needs to shut the hell up. \n\nI dunno. Sorry for rambling I just haven\u2019t been able to get this off my mind.

This has happened twice before.\n\nThey do have other signs of covert N: depression, lack of long lasting close friends, all kinds of selfishness, etc. They\u2019re just so damn good at remaining blameless that I seem insane for wanting to cut all ties. \n\nI\u2019ve been reading a lot about covert narcissism because I keep doubting myself. One article said that coverts will \u201chave feelings of neglect or belittlement, hypersensitivity, anxiety, and delusions of persecution\u201d. Well shit, AM I the crazy one?? Cause that sounds a lot like me right now. \n\nThe only thing I know for sure is that no one else has ever made me feel this way.\n\nHas anyone else had a similar experience or similar feelings?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I appreciate any and all constructive feedback and support. Now, let's get to it.\n\nWhen I was 3 or 4, I was sexually abused by my grandfather. My Dad was in the British Army, so he was never really around and my Mum worked full time, so I spent a lot of time at my grandparents house, often sleeping over. My granny is a saint of a woman, and she's the main reason I haven't told any family member about what happened.\n\nWhen I was 10, my granddad was put on trial for also abusing two of my female cousins, who would've been around the same age at the time of abuse. Firstly, I didn't really remember anything about the abuse until I was 13, and secondly I was not allowed to testify in court for reasons that weren't ever really explained to me. I now work in child protection, and still cannot think of a reason a potential child victim would not be allowed to testify. I got told my granddad refused to \"put me through that\" - I now realise that if that's a valid reason the court allowed, he was just protecting himself from what I may have remembered, and that he's a fucking coward.\n\nHe walked free, and still does. He's 76 now and has had a couple of heart attacks, so he doesn't have long left in him. At the time, my Granny was a wreck. She described it as the worst time of her life - and this is a Northern Irish woman who survived the Troubles and everything they came with. She's a tough lady. And what's more, she gives all her spare time and energy to helping others - she cooks every night for this little old lady down the street who can't do it herself, she does school runs for my youngest cousins because their mum works, she looks after two wee girls part time because their mother is intellectually impaired. At the time, it hurt to see one of the women who raised me like this, and it hurts now to think what me telling my family would do to her. So I've decided, I want my parents to know, but nobody in the extended family. I'm scared. I feel like a little bitch, because I'm also terrified of any retribution from my cousins for not talking sooner. But my adolescence and childhood were rough in other ways, and I haven't felt safe to talk until now. Plus, I work with children every day who are so brave, who will tell me far worse things that happened to them. I tell them every time we have to have these difficult conversations how brave, important and amazing they are and how I admire the way they are able to talk to me about it.\n\nThe question is, how do I tell my parents? If you were a parent, how would you want to know? They're divorced now, so it would have to be two separate occasions so that'll be double fun for me. I know they have their suspicions - my Dad will tell anyone that my Granda is the only man on this planet who he hates with a passion, and he can't wait for the day he burns in hell. I asked Dad if it was anything to do with the trial, and he said yes but refused to elaborate further. My Mum brings it up occasionally, especially if I'm talking about my work. And yes, I work in child protection because I know my abuser will never see justice, but I want other kids to never experience this. I don't believe in a heaven or hell, so my Dad's school of thought brings me no comfort. I'm having my Mum and her partner over for dinner in two weeks, I was thinking of writing everything down and letting her read it. I want her partner to be there so she has the emotional support, I know how difficult it can be for a parent to learn this kind of thing. As for my dad, well, I'll probably just be blunt with him and let him tell me how he knew it all along etc etc.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I came to this conclusion because when in arguments lately, she mentions that she feels liberated from the marriage because I have emotionally abused her and I am a narcissist. This bothered me to the point where I began to cry beyond control. I began to question my self. \"Could I be that bad of a person?\" \"Did I treat her that way?\" So I began to research the behavior of a narcissist and I realized that her behavior reflected those traits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-During the marriage, she would always blame me for everything to the point where she would blame me for her weight, her hair, and her stress. I would ask her what I could do to help. She could never answer the question and would get upset when I did not have a solution for her. So I changed my diet to reflect her wants and needs which I did not mind especially after finding out that I am a diabetic. But down the line, she would get angry with me about how I'm trying to control her buy eating the same thing she was eating and she wanted me to eat something different because she thought it was stupid to buy the same food. She tried to explain to me that it was me controlling her. I expressed to her that I did not understand how it was controlling, that I only wanted to support her, but she called me a B\\*t%H for being sensitive to her needs and it was not manly to do so. This is just one example. In the midst of the conversation, when we get to the point where I ask her to give an example of me being controlling, she could not. She would say when it happens I will let you know. I would say to her if you let me know what I am doing, then I can improve. She would flip that on me and then tell me I'm her husband, I should know, she should not have to explain. She would go a far as to tell me that I am stupid for not understanding. When I would get upset about that comment, she would walk away or fall asleep in the middle of the conversation and the next day act like nothing is wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-To jump to now, we are not divorced and she uses my two daughters against me. She now claims that I am not allowed to see my daughters until I address my mental issues, though she agreed in mediation to visitation terms. She constantly lies about facts in conversations and in our marriage and when I shoe her physical facts, she just changes the subject and brings up something from the past to blame me and try to tie it into why I can see my children. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI made this post short.

She told me they were on a \u2018break\u2019. She love bombed me so hard m, we would go for long drives and we\u2019d just be kissing in my car for hours on end. We spoke constantly,  she always wanted to be around me, if I didn\u2019t reply to her message within a few minutes she\u2019d get funny with me and ask her why I\u2019m ignoring her. We saw eachother for 3 months, 1 month in I said I can\u2019t do this anymore I want you for myself or not at all, she manipulated me saying how special we are and that I\u2019d be making a huge mistake and that she couldn\u2019t live without me. Foolishly I fell for it and carried on for another month. This time she did actually break up with him completely. We continued seeing eachother for a month, still constantly talking etc and things were finally going really well. She would always get jealous of me talking to other girls infront of her though and she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with one my best friends who is a girl. She also got me to turn my snapchat location on so she knew where I was all the time, she would constantly check my last active time, she admitted this too.\n\nFor the last couple weeks of our relationship she started making jokes about my dick size and that I need to go to the gym to tone up (my body is very average, on the skinnier side where as she was pretty fat I won\u2019t lie). I remember the last day before we broke up she said that \u2018she wears the pants in the relationship which got to me a bit. We made plans for our future and she was telling me all the dates she\u2019s booked off for work so we could go on mini trips.\n\nBasically 3 days later she said we need space, she started acting very cold and nothing like the person I fell for. Because she was ignoring me and started backing away it made me panic, I suspected she was cheating or talking to someone else. I called her a mistake and that I shouldn\u2019t have got involved with her in an argument we had. She used this as an excuse and said I pushed her away by being so horrible. She said she was very depressed at the time and wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship with me. I found out she had another snapchat account during the break up which added to my suspicions., when I confronted her about it she denied it and then I showed her proof that she had another account she said she had used that for a couple weeks to talk to her friends. That was it then, she didn\u2019t reach out to me at all, I messaged her a lot after the break up asking for answers and closure in person and she turned me down every time. She then blocked me after a couple weeks everywhere. We work together but in separate departments and she blanks me every time. She might look at me while I\u2019m not looking but then she\u2019ll turn away when I look at her. Obviously at first it hurt like hell, how could someone who \u2018loved me\u2019 treat me like shit and discard me so easily and not even acknowledge my existance. 3 months after the breakup and 2 months NC  and I\u2019m still blocked everywhere. I want her to reach out just so I can tell her what I think of her and how she used me as a rebound. Last week she added me on snapchat but deleted the request instantly. I guess she did this to remind me that she still exists. \n\nAnyway apparently she now has a boyfriend even though she \u2018wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship\u2019. She looks much happier at the moment and I feel she just used me while she was sad and lonely during her breakup with her boyfriend. We didn\u2019t speak at all on the phone when we were together but now she\u2019s constantly on the phone to him whenever I see her. She seems like a different person, maybe this is the person she really is. I just can\u2019t imagine her being how she was with me to someone else because most guys don\u2019t like clingy and controlling girls. Maybe she isn\u2019t a narc but just a bad person.

I had very strict parents no sleepovers and no hanging out with friends without letting them know weeks in advance and even when the day comes they could change their mind for no random reason and I cant object without getting hit. Well my dad was a very abusive man and my family is constantly making excuses for him. Well when I was 17 (20f now)  he tried to kill me because I walked home from church. I had a work meeting 30 mins before and asked him to pick me up, I was wearing my pajamas and didnt do my hair at all. He took me straight to church and it's my grandmother's favorite church and I told him i wasnt going in there looking like this and embarrassing her. I dont want them to think she doesn't take care of me and give me proper clothes to wear for church. So my dad made me sit in the car ( on a hot humid day in Georgia)  with all the windows up until church was over. ( it last about and hour and ten minutes) and he left me there. After about 10 minutes I walked home because I couldnt sit in the car in the heat. When i got home i put my work uniform in the dryer because i had work in 2 hours. I laid down in bed and went to sleep afterwards.  Well when my dad got home he went and took the battery out of my moms phone ahead of time and then broke into my room breaking the door off of the hinges and grabbed me by the throat and threw me off the bed. (Now I sleep backwards in bed, my feet at the headboard and my head at the foot of the bed) he was a good 375lbs. He proceeded to punch me and slam my head against the wall questioning how I got home and claiming I got a ride from some man. He asked where my phone is ( and I knew he had the intention of breaking it so I couldnt call the police) so I managed to choke out that it was in the living room and he stood and went in there all the time my mom and sister never tried to pull him off. My mom screamed at him to stop and my sister just sat there staring and eating her food as I sobbed uncontrollably.  I pulled out my phone from under the pillow and called the police. And when he returned to the room and saw i had my phone and he proceeded to hold me in a chokehold and punch me in the face until I began to lose consciousness.  So fast forward he got arrested and my family denied the ambulance and drove me to a church that lasted and hour and a half before they took me to the hospital.  My aunt, uncle,grandmother and two cousins were in the car. And I was already broken at that point but my grandmother looked at me and exhales then looked at my two cousins and said ,\" well atleast I have you two to be proud of. \"  Which hurt me more than anything, my family then stopped talking to me while my dad was in jail. All but my uncle, who treated me like his own child. 3 years later my uncle passed away and my dad is out of jail and awaiting trial, he's gotten sick and lost both his legs and he's asking me to talk to the district attorney about dropping the charges. He's trying to send me his ps4 as a gift like that would make things different.  They're trying to send me gifts to make me feel better but that wont cut the years of abuse. But the real question is, should I talk to the district attorney? Hes lost both his legs and his youngest brother this year so I feel like he's lost a lot already.

So can you send it to me?\"\n\nNarcissist: \"I dunno...it's probably not what you're looking for.\"\n\nMe: \"It's the same one as last week's right? That's all I need.\"\n\nNarcissist: \"Why'd they ask you to present it to them anyway?\"\n\nMe: \"I don't know. So can I get the report?\"\n\nNarcissist: \"It's probably because you got that big award last month. You know, I should probably try for more of those awards like you do.\"\n\nMe: \"Yeah if you want. Okay just send me the report when you have it.\" \n\nNarcissist: \"But what exactly do you need?

And it can be for many reasons (eg. it could be a combination of the fact that they enjoy the control or that they're legitimately so fearful of things that they won't send the report to you because they're afraid you'll make fun of it / criticize it / find a mistake in it / hurt them in some way about it), but regardless, they are essentially doing the same thing that children do when they are (as some people say) \"being annoying\", except the difference is that they're *adults* so they should have figured this stuff out by now, *and* you can't really make them do it. (Disclaimer: children are great, I just couldn\u2019t find another metaphor for this and the traditional image of a \u201cchild being annoying\u201d came to mind. It\u2019s just my way of saying narcissists can be very immature.)\n\nBasically it's like when a child has made up their mind that they don't want to do something, and they can go on and on without actually doing it. At a certain point, there is no more \"reasoning\" with them. No more explaining will help get what you need done.\n\nAnother difference is that children are not actively trying to manipulate you (well, I hope they're not). They're just trying to divert / stall so they don't have to do the thing you want them to do. The narcissist stalls but at the same time turns it around to get more information out of you, whether it's to take control or because they feel unsafe not knowing all the information. So they use the opportunity to either get some reassurance from you (by playing the victim or putting you down), or to gain more information to use against you later (by having you tell them things you wouldn't have normally told them, eg. if the report were for an important confidential meeting, some people may inadvertently tell the narcissist that it's for an important confidential meeting in the hopes that they'll give them the report, but now the narcissist knows about the meeting *and* can say that you told them about it).\n\nThe point is, watch out for these conversations. Each question may seem like a reasonable question, but when put together in a string like this, there\u2019s a point at which it becomes a control game with the narcissist.\n\n**tl;dr: When you ask a narcissist for something, they may string together questions which are individually reasonable but when strung together it becomes a control game for them, in which they will do anything to not give you the thing (like a traditional \"child being annoying\" situation). Eg. by overly questioning why you need the thing, using the situation as a reason to put you down about something totally different, with-holding it for control, asking for unnecessary clarifications (especially after you've told them to just send everything they have), diverting the request (asking if you've asked someone else for it yet).**\n\n---------------------------\n\nEDIT: As an added bonus, here's the above conversation again but with notes on the narcissist's tactics. Please keep in mind that this conversation can be interpreted in a drastically different way if it's with a coworker you're close with. In this case though, assume you're not close with them and they are just a narcissistic coworker, and that the rest of your team members have no problems sharing reports:\n\nMe: \"Hey Tim, can you send me that report you created?\"\n\nNarcissist: \"Why?\"\n\nMe: \"I need it to show to the Senior Accountant later today.\"\n\nNarcissist: \"Ohh so you're stepping up in the world are you?\" (Trying to make you feel bad about something good that you got.)\n\nMe: \"No, I'm just filling in for someone who's sick today. So can you send it to me?\"\n\nNarcissist: \"I dunno...it's probably not what you're looking for.\" (With-holding for control.)\n\nMe: \"It's the same one as last week's right? That's all I need.\"\n\nNarcissist: \"Why'd they ask you to present it to them anyway?\" (Pushing boundaries by asking for information they don't necessarily have the right to know. Making you feel bad by questioning in a threatened manner.)\n\nMe: \"I don't know. So can I get the report?\"\n\nNarcissist: \"It's probably because you got that big award last month. You know, I should probably try for more of those awards like you do.\" (Invalidating the good thing that happened to you by saying it's because of some other thing, like it was \"easy\" to get. Also, being self-deprecating / praising you is their way of falsely making you feel like you're in the better position, as if them complimenting you makes them a better person OR fawning in the hopes that if they make you feel better about yourself you won't suspect them / hurt them.)\n\nMe: \"Yeah if you want. Okay just send me the report when you have it.\" \n\nNarcissist: \"But what exactly do you need? There's a couple of different versions.\" (With-holding for control.)\n\nMe: \"Send them all.\"\n\nNarcissist: \"Have you asked [other coworker] for the report?\" (With-holding for control and possibly trying to get others involved if they think they'll side with them, or to distract/change topics so they *still* don't have to give you the report.\"\n\nMe: \"No. Please send it to me.\"\n\nNarcissist: \"He probably has a better one.\" (Trying to divert your request.)\n\netc. etc. etc.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My biological mother didn't want her oldest to be her daughter, she wanted a son. She manipulated me into looking and acting like a boy, which made me lash out and in turn get tortured verbally by other kids my entire elementary school career. I moved in with my dad, who was more strict on me since, as I have repeatedly been told, I was a really REALLY bad kid. Like, tear the legs off a spider to watch it squirm and drown ants repeatedly kind of bad kid.\n\nSo this was up in New York, and I was left home alone a lot while my dad and ex step-mother blew everything at casinos. Recently I found out that's considered child-neglect. We lived in a nice house in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood 15 minutes from Niagara Falls. Then we moved to Arkansas, where I had to live with my Nana for a while. Come to find out my ex step-mom was cheating on my dad with her boss, and she left. That's when things slowly started to go down-hill.\n\nMy already bad trust issues and social skills spiraled down into damn-near completely introverted, where I was 12 years old and had panic attacks at the thought of going to the mall with just my new step-sister and no parental supervision. My dad got hooked up with his high school sweetheart and I finally learned what it was like to be not just simply looked after, but treated well.\n\nBut my dad had been hurt a lot by my biological mother and ex step-mother, so much so that he started to take it out on my new step-mom. It started as simple misunderstandings, but it turned into full-blown (sometimes physical) fights. I tried to intervene since I had become a very good neutral party when it came to disputes between my small group of internet friends, but when my dad snapped my phone in half and threw my glasses across the yard (which took ten minutes to find since I can't see farther than 3 inches away from my face), I stopped trying.\n\nEver so slowly, dad started dragging us kids into the fights too, forcing me to choose between the two parents and forcing my distrusting mindset away from my parents to solely on my friends. It was then when I stopped truely feeling empathy for other people and saw them as simply potential stepping-stones to secure a better future for myself, one that didn't involve them.\n\nI can feign feelings, I've gotten so good at it that I fooled my therapist. Hell, when I got to the step in my plan where my step-mom adopts me so I can forcibly rip my biological mother and her family out of my life, I tricked the judge into thinking that my household was perfect by excelling in school, to the point that when we were heard a second time, which I technically was in the 11th grade then, I bore a ring that had shown the graduating class an entire year early than I would've graduated, had I not jumped on the chance to get the rest of my credits at a local college.\n\nBut now, even as I type this post, my father has ordered me to refer to him by his first name, told me he hated me, and practically disowned me since I found my rabbits and other responsibilities here more important than leaving with him to live in the woods. I haven't told my father that I hated him in well-over a decade, since I didn't want to do anything I would regret later. I shoved my angry feelings and pride aside to tell him that I loved him, even as he insisted that I didn't when he dropped me off at school in years past.\n\nAm I wrong for not actually loving him anymore? Am I wrong for using him as a stepping-stone to get as far away from my family as possible? Is it wrong of me to, instead of feel like I'm being torn in half every time he tells me to pick a parent, feel nothing and choose my adopted mom and the responsibilities (and internet) that comes with her? I've tried to get other people's opinions on this, but no one listens. I can't get help, and I can't run. Not while I'm so close to finally getting what I've always wanted.\n\nShould I bide my time and wait the next four years to pass? Or should I run to live with my boyfriend (who I met in real life but lives in another state) as soon as I have the money?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Maybe I\u2019m the one causing problems. \n\n1. I\u2019m always scared of her. I don\u2019t share anything because I don\u2019t want to upset her. When I came out, she said \u201cwhy have you been lying to me for 17 years?\u201d (I was 17 at the time.) When I didn\u2019t text my brother for a week, she said \u201cwhy are you tearing the family apart?\u201d When I got my first period, I was so scared that I didn\u2019t tell her and she screamed at me for being a liar. But everything she says is always provoked. True, I have to walk on eggshells around her but she always finds an actual reason to be upset and then ties it back to my character. \n2. She makes me doubt myself. Whenever I ask her about her saying hurtful things, she says I\u2019m being extreme or overreacting or not remembering them correctly. Once she hit me and I said \u201cyou hit me\u201d and she said \u201cthat didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d \n3. She constantly complains about \u201cbeing made the villain.\u201d She says things like \u201cI gave up so much to raise you, why do you hate me?\u201d If I ask her to stop doing something that hurts me, she says \u201cthere you go again, always playing the victim and making me the bad guy.\u201d Maybe she\u2019s right; I can\u2019t tell anymore. \n4. I\u2019m hypersensitive to her mood. I can tell by the way she says hello if she\u2019s angry or not. When I was little, I used to hide in closets when she was angry. This happened at least once a week. Oftentimes there seemed to be no explanation for why she felt that way, and she would find something I did wrong to yell at me about. \n5. She doesn\u2019t respect my boundaries. She used to come into the bathroom while I was showering just to yell at me. \n6. She invalidates my emotions. \u201cStop looking so sad/scared.

Growing up, my father would get drunk almost two to three times each week. Each time would be wrought with fights every night and would sometimes lead to my mother saying \"We are arguing about you.

Still, it's not my fault and even though I know it's not my fault, I find myself still struggling with people-pleasing, addictive behaviors, poor anger management, depression, low self esteem and unhealthy boundaries because of my upbringing.   \nI've always had to be your \"golden child\". Growing up in the traditional Asian household, I was constantly expected to do well while simultaneously compared and ridiculed to be like my cousins (I recognize alot of families do this but my situation with my parents' emotional abuse didn't make it any better). I'm thankful for all the love and support from family and friends growing up. I'm honored to have been a straight A honors student with a decent amount of friends growing up\n\nBut my mother doesn't understand that I didn't choose to be emotionally tortured and placed in the situation I was in. I didn't choose to have a father that lied to me about his alcoholism repeatedly and curse out my mother to my face on multiple occasions. I didn't choose to grow up gay in a conservative setting and struggle with my sexuality to this day. I didn't choose to be a target of sexual assault from my father when he was drunk.   \nEven though I recently graduated college with honors, I'm a person that needs more than academic growth. I have a lot of healing to work on daily and it doesn't help that I'm still the reason that my father bickers with my mother when he's drunk.  If only my mother could understand that just as much as it is hard for her to deal with my father, it's even harder when I am told to \"be nice\" so he doesn't get drunk and ramble to her.   \nThis doesn't mean that I'm an ungrateful golden brat of a son. I acknowledge the sacrifice my mother had to make to raise me while dealing with my father. I recognize that I wasn't the most helpful son growing up.

Thank you so much for that.\n\nI only packed my clothes and my car because I feared that I'd cause legal trouble if she claimed anything I took was hers, and this means I'd have to see her again.\n\nI'm on the drive home right now; 3 hours in and I'm at a restaurant writing this. I freaking miss her so badly. I have the urge to go back, and every minute I drive, the urge gets even bigger because I feel like I still have a chance to turn the car around.\n\nI left a note for her on my bed, explaining why I think she's a narcissist and apologizing for leaving so suddenly. She's going to read it and get really angry, and I know that if I return, she'll beat me up pretty badly and I honestly think it's possible she'd kill me. What's crazy is, I WANT her to hit me. I miss getting hit by her so bad. It's such a weird mindset I can't explain, and I know you all might not understand, but I really wish she'd just beat me up right now.\n\nI wish I could text her. I know she'd show me a lot of love and allow me to talk to her. Even though I know it's fake, and merely a tactic to pull me back in, I still crave it so much. \n\nI just felt SAFE with her. She told me what to do, but being controlled meant that I didn't have to make my own decisions. Everything was very clear cut; if she hit me, I did something wrong. If she didn't, I did something right. That was just EASY to understand and live by. Pleasing her and getting the endorphins/adrenaline from it was basically what my life revolved around, and I honestly don't think I'd be happy with any other life. This is absolutely crazy, but to be honest, I don't want another girlfriend who's not narcissistic. I miss it so much.\n\nI also feel guilty. Sure, she's a narcissist, but she still has emotions. She's going to be really upset that I just...left, and I do think she's going to miss me too. She was simply born a narcissist, the same way homosexuals and the disabled are, and I feel guilty for not accommodating for her lifestyle. I definitely COULD endure her abuse, but I chose to run away from it. I feel like a mother abandoning her disabled child.\n\nWriting this post made me realize how flawed my logic is and how brainwashed I am.

I have  no    one left to turn to and no institutions (including the government  of    Canada) seem to be willing to help me in any way. I am addressing  this    to Mr Singh because he himself is a survivor of sexual abuse and  I    believe he knows how devastating the effects of childhood sexual  abuse    can be on a human being. That being said I am open to help from  anyone    who can offer me assistance.  I fear greatly for my safety.**\n\nDear Mr Singh\n\nMy     name is Gerard , I am a 46 year old male &amp; Canadian citizen     currently residing in southern California &amp; I am on the verge of     homelessness. I am at the end of my rope and out of options.\n\nI am reaching out to you with this email because I recently heard your interview on[ CBC Radio\u2019s The Current](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-april-23-2019-1.5103180/i-tried-to-bury-it-down-ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh-says-he-was-sexually-abused-as-a-child-1.5106383)and  thought, you might be able to help with my situation (or offer   some   guidance) based on our shared histories of sexual abuse.\n\nI     was born and raised in the National Capital Region having lived on    both  sides of the river. The first half of my childhood in Hull (now     Gatineau) and the second half on the Ottawa/Ontario side. As a child I     was a victim of neglect &amp; abuse, including - emotional, physical   and   sexual.\n\nAlthough  I didn\u2019t  figure   this out until decades later. This abuse included my  father  involving   me in cross border sex trafficking, as well as abusing  me  himself.   These abuses started at approximately age three and lasted   into my   teens. Things became so bad that at one point I was made a   temporary   ward of the Crown and wound up living on the streets of  Ottawa  for   prolonged periods of time. Alcohol, drugs and violence  became an    everyday part of life and I lived in constant fear for my  safety. For my    life.[In  june of 1988 I was featured in an Ottawa Citizen story on the     \u201cproblem of street youth in the Byward Market area. I am the Gerry in     the story](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mDuxREDYqxR1kifMalZr7j8mAeezg8V_/view).\n\nI  eventually recovered    and moved on to what appeared at least on the  surface to be a more    normal life. But that came at a high price. I took  the blame for all  of   the abuse I endured. My parents told me it was all  my own doing,  my   own fault. As a child I didn\u2019t know any better and so I  believed  them.   They scapegoated me and in my naivete I let them and  instead of   holding  them accountable, I turned my pain into self-hatred  and a   shame that  still haunts me to this day. I don\u2019t fully understand  how I   did it but I  somehow managed to repress the vast majority of the    abuse I lived  through as a child. My only guess is that I accepted my    parents party  line that I was a \u201cbad little boy\u201d and denied my    experiences, until  they finally faded out of my mind and were pushed    down deep into my  subconscious. I suppose that in large part I    accomplished this through  the abuse of drugs and alcohol.\n\nWhile    I  was never able to graduate from High School I did eventually  enroll   in  and graduate from Algonquin College\u2019s, School of Health  &amp;    Community Studies as a Developmental Services Worker. It was an     incredibly difficult task for me to accomplish and it took years.  Not    for lack of intelligence but because I never got the proper  foundational    academic, social &amp; life skills, I should have  received growing  up.\n\nI   have had  periods of moderate  success at various times in my life which  I  won\u2019t  detail here but no  matter the success, my self-hatred and/or    addictions would get the  better of me and self-sabotage would ensue. It    has cost me friends,  job opportunities and psychological stability    throughout my entire  adulthood. No matter how hard I try, I always  seem   unable to outrun  the demons of my past. Most of the time all of  these   things happen  without my fully understanding what was/is  holding me back   or why it  was/is happening. There have been many  suicide attempts  going  back to  my early 20s. Fortunately my attempts  thus far have  failed  because I  don\u2019t want to die. I WANT TO LIVE! But  in my darkest  moments I  lose so  much hope that I can\u2019t seem to see  any other  solution. All I  know is  that my trauma has continued to  plague me up  until this very day  and  it has ruined my life on more  than one  occasion.\n\nIn   2006 I met a  woman from  California fell in love and moved there to be   with her. We  got married  the following year. Unfortunately marriage  and a  new  country didn\u2019t  solve or fix the trauma of my past and over  the next   several years my  psychological state deteriorated to the  point that I   essentially became  a non-functional shut in. I didn't  understand what   was wrong. My wife  didn\u2019t understand what was wrong.  Much of my past  was  still repressed  and forgotten. To the outside  world I just  looked like a  dysfunctional,  lazy loser and for the most  part that\u2019s  how I was  treated. Hell, I  even treated myself like that  was the  truth.\n\nI   continued  deteriorating  psychologically for years becoming less and   less  functional. I sought  out psychiatric treatment and was diagnosed   with a  variety of  conditions including things like major depression,   anxiety  disorder,  PTSD and manic depression to name but a few. I tried   one  medication  after another but nothing seemed to help and I just kept    getting  sicker and sicker.\n\nThis continued up until 2015 when I began having horrifying flashbacks of some pretty hideous child abuse.\n\nDetailed     memories of incidents of violence and sexual abuse from my early     childhood began resurfacing and I confronted my mother about them and     she admited to knowing about them and actively covering them up. While     she did admit to the incidents I recalled and brought up with her,  she    continued to cover up the more egregious one\u2019s that I was still     repressing but I will get to that in a moment.\n\nIn     late December of 2015, my wife and I flew back to Canada to file     criminal complaints, related to sexual and physical abuse with the local     police (at that time the Gatineau Police &amp; The OPP) which led to     several investigations and one man being charged by the Crown in   Quebec.\n\nDuring   this trip I managed to   get both my father and mother (now divorced) to   admit to their role   in covering up two instances of sexual abuse of  me,  their only child.   Specifically, they both wrote out, signed and   submitted official   statements to the police admitting to covering up two   separate   instances of sexual assault dating back to 1975 and1977.  These  were   separate incidents, with two different abusers.\n\nI     have copies of all their police statements if you are interested.     Alternatively I can give you the case numbers if you would like to see     copies directly from the police.\n\nDuring     the same trip, I also filed another complaint against my father for    one  of the many physical assaults he inflicted on me but I won't go    into  details regarding that now. Best I keep things focused on the    sexual  abuse aspects. Suffice it to say I have documented medical and    children's  aid  evidence to support the physical abuse claims as well.\n\nI     remained in the Ottawa area for several weeks during which time I  was    video interviewed twice by the Gatineau Police for the 1975 and  1977    sexual assaults that took place on the Quebec side of the river.  Once    that was done I flew back to California to return to my life  with my    wife.\n\nWhen  I got back to  California I   began to feel better. My depression lifted a  little and  my suicidal   ideation decreased. I found a therapist and  began working  through my   now identified cPTSD and the details of the two  recalled  childhood   sexual assaults. However, within about a month of my  return  I knew   something was wrong. My suicidal ideation was creeping  back  up and   while I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it, I had a sick feeling  in  the pit   of my stomach that there was more abuse. Shortly after that I   started   having more flashbacks and realized that I was the victim of   way more   sexual abuse.\n\nTurns  out  those two   incidents I reported in January of 2016 were just the tip   of the   iceberg. I recovered more memories. One being that in the  summer  of   1980 I was admitted to[ CHEO](https://www.cheo.on.ca/en/index.aspx) for surgery.\n\nI\u2019m    not sure how I was able to block it out for so long but I managed to     repress all of the events of that surgery for decades. Then for some     reason on December 23rd 2016, it just all popped back into my mind.\n\nI     remembered having the warts on my butt. I remembered the surgery     performed on my rectal region and I remember that at the time of the     surgery my parents blamed me. They said it was because \u201cI didn\u2019t do a     good enough job wiping my bum\u201d.\n\nA     couple of days after recovering these memories, I called my mother (who     now lives in Aylmer across the river from Ottawa) and confronted her.     She got really nervous and said she thought I should call my father   and   ask him about it. Long story short, I did. When I asked him about   it I   got a long silent pause and then him denying knowing anything   about it.  I  know that\u2019s a lie because I remember him and my mother   blaming me  for  the warts. I told him as much and from that point on he   just dug in  and did  his best to keep the lie going.\n\n[I contacted CHEO and managed to get copies of the pathology report which can be found here](https://i.redd.it/utw5ui5uatp11.png)\n\nTurns out I was infected with anal condylomata which is the result of HPV. Typically a sexually transmitted disease.\n\nAt     this point it would be good to remind you that my parents have   already   admitted to covering up two separate instances of sexual   abuse.  Written  statements on record with the Gatineau Police.\n\nAll     of the recent flashbacks began to make sense. I now remembered    multiple  incidents of sexual assault including the one which I believe    led to  the infection. I also remember the person who infected me and    his name.   And I am now certain that my father had me involved in  some   sort of  child sex trafficking beginning in the 1970s and  continuing   well in to  the 1980s.\n\nAll   this led to   my having a complete break down. My depression and  suicidal  ideation   have been through the roof. I spent the better part  of 2017 in  and out   of Trauma Units being treated for CPTSD.\n\nAll     of this was too much for my wife of ten plus years. She kicked me to     the curb and I have more or less been indigent since then. My only     supports are other people who I met while in trauma units here in  SoCal.    They can barely function themselves.\n\nMy     life has spun out of control. My marriage disintegrated and I lost     everything.  I've lost most of my possessions and have almost no  money.\n\nThen    last summer I was  involved in an accident resulting in my left knee    shattering and a  tendon becoming detached. This has led to me requiring    multiple  surgeries and I have been bed/house bound for the better  part   of the  last year. I\u2019m still not cleared to work and am unable to  walk   more  than a few blocks with the aid of a cane.\n\nI     am in constant pain, unable to work and am housebound in another     persons (a woman I met in a trauma unit) home and I expect to be     homeless by as early as August 1st.\n\nI\u2019ve     reported everything to both the Ottawa Police and the Ontario     Provincial Police (OPP). Unfortunately neither seem to be interested in     helping me very much. Despite having medical records and a plethora  of    Children's Aid records all pointing to abuse. Neither the OPP nor    Ottawa  Police are willing to pursue serious investigations. The  Ottawa   Police  basically said that it\u2019s my word against my fathers,  despite  all  of the  documentation I provided them with. The OPP just  basically   ignored me.\n\nI  have asked  my extended   family for help but they are unwilling to do  anything  other than take   the occasional phone call. No offers to help  get me  back home or to   even lend me some money to get by here in  California.\n\nI\u2019ve been in touch with victim services in both Ottawa and Gatineau but there is really little they can do for me.\n\nI     have called and asked the Canadian Consulate in LA for help getting    back to Canada and they  responded by saying \u201cWe aren't social  services.   Get yourself to a  homeless shelter.\u201d I tried explaining  that I am   severely injured and  unable to travel and that I have  medical   documentation stating that I am  both physically and  psychiatrically   disabled and unable to fend for  myself. They didn\u2019t  care.\n\nIn   terms of  support here in  California I qualify for about $190 a month   in food  stamps and a  little over $200 a month in general relief (GR)   from the  state of  California.  However, I am not near public transit   (not to  mention  unable to travel by foot) and can\u2019t get into their   offices to  fill  out the paperwork for the GR and so I don\u2019t even have   the ability  to  set up to collect that $220 a month. Just have the food   stamps.\n\nI   have a friend in British   Columbia who has offered to let me sleep in   his van but I need to be   able to get there and have no safe way of   getting there currently.\n\nI am out of options. Out of time and I fear for my safety.\n\nI\u2019m at best a few weeks away from being on the street and I\u2019m in no shape to survive that.\n\nI am in complete fear for my safety and believe that I am on the verge of being in real danger.\n\nI need help and I need it now.\n\nSincerely\n\nGerard.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Just starting to get my life back together and tentatively starting to date again. \n\nI met a guy and everything felt so normal and exciting!! But not narc-exciting, just like a hot butterfly filled crush! So awesome!! Several dates and tons of escalating calls and text conversations later and New Guy suddenly realizes I am the ex girlfriend of Nex, who is one of his childhood friends. New Guy and I had never met, because Nex apparently compartmentalized me in his life.  \n\nFor the record, I truly believe New Guy was unaware that I was Nex's ex girlfriend. \n\nSince this revelation, New Guy has backed off the romantic, flirty, sexy part of our conversations, which was such a let down but makes sense to me. I would if I were him as well. \n\nBut New Guy has also decided his role is to \"mend the rift\" between me and Nex so that we can \"all be friends\" and no one will have any bad feelings. He's essentially turned into a flying monkey. I don't think he is malicious. I think he honestly sees himself as a peacemaker.  \n\nNew Guy formed a group on Whatsapp that included me and Nex. Even if you block someone from your phone, they and you can still be added to a group chat on Whatsapp! \n\nAnd so I woke up one morning to a surprise chat in progress, in which New Guy was asking Nex if he thought we could mend our \"friendship\" and Nex took the liberty of listing all of the awful things I did to him (went no contact which is abusive, didn't congratulate him on the baby he conceived during our relationship, didn't ever ask how his daughter is doing after she was born, didn't accept my invites to his house for dinner with his new wife and child) before saying that EVEN CONSIDERING all of that terrible stuff - Yes, he would be the bigger person and extend an olive branch to me.  \n\nNew Guy was so pleased with himself. Prayer hands of thanks emojis were flying. \"Thank you, brother, for taking this step towards peace!\" \n\nNew Guy then prompted me, \"poisondrinker, now you can say your feelings, too\" \n\nWhat I didn't say: I can't believe that a week ago I was about 5 minutes from having crazy fun new relationship sex with New Guy and now I'm witnessing prayer hands of thanks for his unwitting flying monkey role in breaking very hard won NC on my end. I will never, ever be free of this covert fucking manbaby victimy Narc.  \n\nI refuse to engage. I especially refuse to engage with New Guy (who will never, ever see me as dating material now) benevolently presiding over the ceremonial peace summit.  \n\nNex LOVES this. He loves it. He couldn't have engineered a better set up. I am massively suspicious that he did engineer it, except the way I met New Guy was totally organic and off the grid so I think it's impossible.  \n\nSo New Guy is now Former New Guy and that stupid theater of a whatsapp chat makes me want to barf and I'm apparently single again and maybe I'm single for life. \n\nWhat a crappy, crappy development in my recently promising new romantic life.

{"post_id": "cdg0sp", "created_utc": 1563188312, "title": "Wanted to share my story - this is quite graphic", "author": "ziyal79", "self_text": "I've suffered from depression for most of my life. I think I first remember feeling depressed when I was 12. I first remember experiencing suicidal ideation when I was 14, maybe 15. I was bullied all throughout my childhood and my parents were of no help. They refused to help in any way, just told me to stop being upset about it and deal with it. So I learned to, by internalising it.\n\nThis set me up poorly for the experience of my first boyfriend when I was 20. I've come to understand as time has progressed that he definitely had something - narcissism, psychopathy. Something dark and pretty extreme. I recently read \"Psychopath Free\" and found that the pattern of Idealise, Devalue, Discard fit pretty well. Let me explain.\n\nWhen I was 20 (literally, it was my 20th birthday), I was at the pub with friends, and well... mostly friends of friends. I knew like two people and I was pretty bored. So this guy waved me over. I thought \"what harm is there in talking to some guy?\" Well, it turned out there was plenty. I was a bit tipsy and just surprised by the amount of attention he showed me. He wanted to know everything about me, I was pretty compliant. He talked to me about my favourite bands, told me he'd looked the part, listened to my favourite bands and was a fan. We met up in public a few times after that. He tried to integrate me into his life, but I wasn't that interested. But I was interested in him, but I think mostly because he'd showed so much interest in me. It seemed genuine, he was affectionate, flirty and seemed pretty normal.\n\nAs things progressed over the next two months, he tried talking me into watching the porn he liked, which I ignored. He wanted me to be his \"little porn star\". He, in hindsight, was trying to prepare me for what he expected of me, sexually. He tried talking me into anal sex, even though I said I wasn't interested. I was very clear. But the first time, we had sex, he forced me to have anal sex, no niceties, bareback and lube free. He ignored my refusals and just insisted that he knew I'd like it, I just didn't know it. Honestly, I was a bit stunned and confused by this experience. I remember telling him I wasn't interested in doing that again. He tried to convince me that he knew my boundaries and likes far better than I did.\n\nI moved into a 3rd storey flat and one Sunday not too long after I'd moved in, I accidentally locked my keys inside the flat. I didn't have a flatmate and I couldn't climb to the third story and try to break in because it had louvered windows. I asked a guy in the next block of flats for help. He paid for a locksmith to unlock my door. The guy seemed pretty harmless, so he invited me over for dinner and I accepted. He tried to get me drunk, but wine was on offer and I don't like wine, so I hardly drank anything. In the guise of a tour of the house, he tried to get me into the bedroom, but something felt really off, so I attempted to bail. On the way out of the front door, he groped me and I expressed my extreme displeasure and left. When I got a hold of my ex, I told him what had happened. I expected something along the lines of \"protective boyfriend\" and what I got was \"Well, what did you expect? He \\*paid\\* to get your door open. You should have at least have been nice enough to push on a show for him, if you wouldn't fuck him. He was just getting what he rightly deserved.\"\n\nIt's fair to say that I was pretty shocked. I didn't know what to say. After that conversation, I started to formulate in the back of my mind that I needed to get away from this guy. I knew his response was just wrong. But I didn't know what the hell to do. My ex would call before he would come for sex. And it was always the same, I wasn't allowed to use condoms, no lube, any discomfort was my fault for not being turned on enough. It was always: blowjob, vaginal sex, anal sex, and if he was unhappy with me for some reason, he'd force me to blow him again, no clean up. And sometimes he position me in front of a mirror so that I had to watch myself. I told him how upset and disgusted I was that he'd done that to me, and he told me that it was my fault, that if I'd just done what he wanted in the first place, he wouldn't have had to do it. Also, he didn't know what I was bitching about because he knew I secretly enjoyed it. He also told me that if I were a *better person*, he'd treat me better.\n\nI made myself unavailable if he called ahead, so he realised that he had to just rock up without warning. I couldn't avoid him, he wouldn't go away despite my many requests, so I knew when he came, I just had to get through. I adopted this strategy for a few months. Just do what he wanted, keep him happy. I couldn't predict what he would do if I didn't. One time when I refused to deep throat him, he just grabbed me by the hair and forced his penis so far down my throat that I couldn't breathe. I thought I was going to die. I tried my hardest to fight him off, but I couldn't shake his grip. He was greatly amused by my desire to fight him off, and I remember him chuckling, probably at the fact that I couldn't fight him off because I couldn't get a good grip on his arm. I vomited on his penis and then he stopped. He just paused. I froze and I remember clearly thinking that if I didn't do something, he was going to kill me. So I swallowed my vomit back down like nothing had happened and continue to blow him until he came. He wasn't going to let me go until he'd been satisfied, so I couldn't do anything else.\n\nBefore this, I'd been indicating to him for months that not only did I know that he was outright raping me - which was bullshit because if he *was* raping me, I'd know about it. What ever that actually meant, I don't know. I told him I was feeling suicidal. He told me that I deserved to be lined up and shot anyway. That I should commit suicide. It would be a community service, but he'd miss fucking me. I told him I wanted to leave the town we were living in. He told me he'd kill me if I tried to leave. I took him at his word and I got the hell out. I did have sex with him one more time, I felt like he might just leave me be if I did. Then I flew interstate back to where my mother lived. He called me once after that he missed how \"wild and untrainable\" I was. Which was not how I remembered it at all. I thought I was entirely compliant. But after this, I never heard from him again. I ran into him once, about 3 years later in a supermarket and that triggered my PTSD off. And it's been a bit of a shit show ever since.\n\nI hate to admit this, but it's almost been 20 years since this happened and I often feel like I'm still affected as if it happened yesterday - except that I've done some trauma processing and I can see things a bit more clearly. The flashbacks I experience from the abuse are so intense in terms of somatic symptoms, that I can smell my ex, I feel his touch, it's literally like the abuse is actually happening again and all I want to do is some combination of cry, scream, vomit and tear my skin off.\n\nI haven't had a relationship since as much as I would love to feel loved by a man who deserves me, I feel like I'm just too damaged to inflict myself on another person. So I'm a lonely cat lady instead.\n\nBut the trauma processing has help me see that the abuse was abuse and as much as my ex made me feel complicit in my own abuse, that that was just his gaslighting bullshit. It's a hard slog, but there's some hope that my PTSD might actually get better with a medication change and I can go back to coping - at least to some degree better than I can now.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

They never thought they would see me again. \nI had full custody of my son for the first 6 months of his life. \nI filed for a PFA against my ex, because I knew he would come after me. \nFinally, my ex fought for custody once he was back in the area. \nAll I had was pictures of my bruises and lacerations. \nI couldn\u2019t prove that he abused me. The court gave him time with my son. \nNow, he has partial custody half of the week. I do not speak to or see my ex on any occasion. I am only in contact with his parents and grandmother. \nI am now with a new guy, who makes my heart sing. He is the most perfect person I have ever met. \nI cheated on him with my ex last February. He is still so broken over it, but he still decides to stay with me. \nIt is very hard for him to accept my son, for I cheated on him with his father. \nI understand his point of view but I wish I never did what I did to him. \nIt took me up to this point to weigh out my options. \nI want to runaway and never return. Because then I would drop custody of my son and live the life I deserve. \nI know that\u2019s selfish but you only have one life. I am so torn. I need answers. Opinions. I just want to be happy and I never will be here. I love my son, but he deserves so much better and I\u2019m so guilty I brought him into this world when I wasn\u2019t ready for it. How do I leave? How will I be able to live with myself?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He was truly evil, and getting disentangled from his web took years).\n\nI met N #1 when I was 27. I had gone back to college to finish my degree, and we had the same major and were in some of the same classes. He was younger than me, but incredibly funny and easy to talk to. We became friends. I had a great boyfriend at the time, and we lived together, but meeting the Narc changed everything. I fell head over heels, madly, insanely in love for the first time in my life. It felt like being infected with a virus. Like, wipe the drool off my face, swooning soul mate kind of love. To this day, N #1 is the only person I ever had those kind of feelings for.\n\nOf course at that time I had zero insight and didn't know that I was so drawn to N #1 because he was so much like my N parents, especially Ndad. I didn't understand that I was programmed with a certain \"type\" because of how I was raised. Instead, I just concluded that N #1 must be my soul mate. I ended up cheating on my boyfriend with the N, destroying that relationship, throwing myself at the N like an idiot, after which he strung me along for a year. Lots of hot and cold, having these passionate encounters and then ignoring me for months. It was torture.\n\nHe finally discarded me, and I fell into a dark depression. I had never *never* been affected like this by a love interest. Never never never. I was always able to bounce back. Within a few months I would be over that person and moved on. But with the Narc, I did recover eventually from that awful dark depression, but I never got over him. I always had this nagging feeling inside that it wasn't over.\n\nEleven years passed. I became engaged to a different man, a nice man, and we were together for six years. It didn't work out, and six months after we broke off the engagement, I got a hoover from the Narc.\n\nELEVEN YEARS LATER. Seriously. You are never safe from a hoover.\n\nAnd before I knew what was happening, I was sucked right back into that old obsession.\n\nI met up with the Narc for a drink, ostensibly just to catch up on old times, just friends. The second time we met up, a week later, we slept together, and it was back on. This time around I was 39, and he was 33. The last time I saw him was just after his 22nd birthday.\n\nThis time, unlike college, he wanted a relationship with me. No more hooking up and then ignoring me. A real deal serious relationship. I felt like I had won the lottery. I thought this was it for me. I was sold for life. What I had felt for my former fiance, the nice guy I was with for six years, paled in comparison. It seemed like the connection with the Narc was so much deeper.\n\nSo a relationship we had. For three years.\n\nIt took six months for me to start to realize that something was wrong with him. A year for me to KNOW that he was deeply disturbed and violent. Another two years for me to get out.\n\nHe hid his true personality, his sociopathic evil, behind a very convincing facade of normalcy. When I met him back in college, I thought he was truly the most likable person I had ever met.\n\nHe works for a nonprofit full of idealistic activist types, and he is their golden boy. They all socialize together, go on camping trips and fun outings. He has other long time friends, and family members in our city, some of whom live in the same building as him. And no one knows that he is a psychopath. No one knows Mr. Hyde, only Jekyll.\n\nI could tell story after story of how I slowly realized that the love of my life was evil, and abusive, and I needed to get the fuck out, for my own safety. But this post would be far too long.\n\nThe cognitive dissonance was INSANE, and I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. He would do awful things, psychologically torturing me, showing me who he really was behind the mask, and I would be consumed with the need to end things and get away. But slowly the fog would creep back in, and memories of the abuse would recede to the back of my mind. Abuse amnesia. I would feel my crippling obsession once again taking hold, and I couldn't leave.\n\nFinally, in the summer of 2017, he threatened to drive to my house and kill me during a phone argument. He said the consequences would be worth it to not have to deal with me anymore. His voice was calm and ice cold, and I knew that he meant it. I knew very well that he was capable of this. He had shown me his true face many times during our relationship.\n\nAnd that was the end for me. That's what did it. The last time I saw him was July 9, 2017, and the last time I heard his voice was July 14, 2017. I met N #2 soon after. He was more garden variety Narcissist, than the pure evil psychopath that was N #1. I ended up being grateful for N #2, because his presence in my life was what I needed to finally cut ties with the first Narc. Finally my obsession, that had spanned so many years of my life, going back to my twenties, was dead.\n\nI'm 44 now, writing this, and both Narcs are long out of my life, and I have no lingering attachment to either of them. I've been single for over a year, and like it that way. I've been working on myself, and even went No Contact with my N parents last January. It's a time of great change and growth.\n\nI just wanted to share this accomplishment with all of you. Toot my own horn a little. It's been hard won, and I'm sure you understand. Quitting an addiction to a Narc, some say, is even harder than quitting heroin. I would agree.\n\nTwo years into NC, all I can say with absolute certainty is that it's worth it. 100%.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Push came to shove and I told her if she needed a place to stay and get away from the abuse that she could stay with me. I don't want to give to many details but she told her parents it was her or her abuser and now she lives in my house. She has been flourishing the past 6 months! She has made big changes and even though we've had a few setbacks I'm so proud of her!\n\nMy only issue is her boyfriend. I do have some boundaries because she lives here rent free and she is still a teenager while her boyfriend is in his mid-twenties. We had a couple of instances where he will yell at her, cuss her out, and physically stop her from leaving when they are fighting. The pattern is once a month, she comes home shakey and upset, and then they talk it out and she decides to work it out. No matter how many times I tell her she is worthy and loved she continues this relationship and the fighting is getting progressively worse. The last one she was yelled and cussed at in a public parking lot.\n\nIt's a pattern, it's getting worse so I finally had to tell her that because of her boyfriend's behavior he isn't allowed in our house and she can't at his house alone anymore.

I know that isn't true and I understand where her thought process is and I understand her boyfriend twists my words around.\n\nWe are now to a point where she told me I couldn't tell her what to do and I told her if she felt like that she could pay rent and be a roomate vs someone I'm taking care of. I have so many people telling me to kick her out because how she lashes out but I can't. She has no friends, no family, and she'll go live with her boyfriend and if her internship finds out she will not be allowed to pursue her whole career goal (church based). \n\nI need some advice on how I go forward and if there is anything I can do different to help the situation? \n\nI know I want everything in order and I want to be in control but I'm trying, I've actually gone back to therapy so I can be in my best mental state for her.

My brother was always skiving from school, I think he was around 13. When my mother was out during lunchtime and he was home he'd make me do sexual acts on him. Give him blowjobs and hand jobs. He'd also make me do it when we were alone in his room, he even made me take baths with him and do it then. He'd also make me do it in the middle of the night when he was downstairs playing porn games or watching porn on the computer. One time (that I remember) he forced me to let him ejaculate on me.\n\nI don't know when it stopped or why, I'm just glad it did. But I still struggle with have the memory of doing it whilst living in the same house with him. My family all knows I dislike him, I hate him, but only my mother and boyfriend know why. I've been together with my boyfriend since we were 16 years old. We had probably been dating foor half a year when we started doing sexual things and I noticed from myself I was very apprehensive, I still am sometimes but it is better. I told him about what happened with my brother and he consoled me and said I should probably tell my family but told me it was my choice if I did. After about another year I told my mother and she said she had never realised he made me do anything. She said we shouldn't tell my father as he'd probably kick my brother out of the house and my brother probably wouldn't fare very well. (He has a form of autism and is just very lacking in most useful human things, e.g. waking up on time, keeping a job, going to school) My mother was very understanding, don't get me wrong, but we just couldn't do anything after so many years. I don't even think my brother remembers doing anything like it.\n\nI really hate being around him and don't really want him in my life.

We were together for about 3 years in total and married for 3 months when I left. This wasn't my first experience with an abusive relationship. When I was 14 my first boyfriend who was a few years older than I physically and mentally abused me. After a year of dating I finally went to my mom for help. I was able to get my life back together pretty quickly after that. I continued on with dating well into my late 20s avoiding people who I knew had abusive tendencies. I met Paul when I was 27. I was about a year out of a healthy relationship that ran its course. Paul fit into my life so perfectly. We had a similar upbringing, we had mutual friends growing up. Things moved pretty quickly. I was happy and everything felt right. Three weeks in something happened that I immediately recognized as a red flag.  I made plans for our friends to meet for the first time. My friends were late and not very apologetic, which was okay. It was a casual get together. However, Paul did not take it well. In fact as the night progressed actions or situations seem to accumulate to him. By the time we got in the car he unleashed on me. I knew what was happening. I was able to identify his actions immediately. However, the next morning he apologized. He apologized with so much disappointment in himself.. I thought maybe it was just the result of something else he was dealing with. This would continue from time to time in the beginning of our relationship. We were \"working\" on his tantrums. Then about 6 months into the relationship trying to convince me to go to the gym with him, the criticism began. About the way I looked, how I stood, the food I ate, how I ate, the faces I made. It never ended. In the beginning it came across as if he was helping me. Showing me the right way to do things. So I listened and thats when he took complete control over my life. I moved to Indiana about a few months of being engaged since he was accepted to start his PhD in the fall. I lived alone as he was finishing up his masters for the first couple of months. We had a pretty easy going long distance relationship. I was excited to start on this new journey together.  Shortly after him moving to Indy the abuse started again. However, now we were in a new place where we only new each other and everything intensified. The abuse became so crippling that it started to take toll on my physical health. I left my ex 3 months after being married because he put his hands around my throat one night during his tantrums. I knew then there was no turning back after that. Till this day because I left I never received an apology and his family still stands by his actions. It took a really long time for be to get over everything that I had dealt with. I had a hard time going grocery shopping or even cooking for myself. I couldn't exercise. I just constantly in the back of my head had his voice reminding me that I was doing something wrong.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI started dating casually after 8 months. I went on a date with someone I trusted. We built a friendship and he understood my scenario. He was kind and patient with me and knew that we would only remain friends. I then started to date someone a little more seriously a couple months after that. I let this person into my life a little bit more than the last to see where things could go, but things shortly fizzled as I am probably not moving as fast to jump into anything.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo months ago I agreed to go on a date with someone I connected with on a dating app a year prior, almost right after I left my ex. (I took terrible advice from a friend). Bryan (28) and I stayed in contact over the year. I would occasionally bail on him when we'd make plans, he would do the same. We had some very deep conversations through text, which to be honest I didn't trust his intentions.. so it took me a year to finally agree to go out with him. Our first date was comfortable. I felt safe with him like he was an old friend. He felt the same, and I know because he kept repeating it. He treated me with respect. Our second date we went hiking, we shared a moment during this hike that was very profound to me and full of vulnerability. On the way back from the hike he told me he had a surprise, but wanted to make sure I was comfortable. \"What ever you need to get comfortable for the surprise I will make it happen, but it's very casual so don't worry\".. I saw in another post on here that moment where you feel comfort and support from someone after being abused is just a peculiar feeling. He made a bed in the back of his car and brought me to the drive-in. We ended up staying for 3 movies and getting back to his place very late and he asked for me to spend the night with him and I wanted to. We haven't left each others side since. I've met his parents after the first week. Every other week we stay at the other persons place. It's moving fast. It seems too fast. About a month and a half into it he started to experience a depressive episode. He was open with me and spoke to me about what was going on, to assure me that I wasn't the cause of it. I remained open to him for support. However, this has now intensified my insecurities. I feel as if he's going to abruptly leave me, that he is using me to fill some void, that he isn't actually happy with me. I've been dealing with this for the past two weeks and yesterday I finally couldn't take it anymore. I let him in and told him how I was feeling and how I was scared. We talked it out and he assured me that those things were not the case and that he's also noticed me beginning to close off and how he is scared and worried that I might leave him because what I'm feeling. After speaking with him a few hours later my irrational thinking started to creep up again and continued into the day. After having a serious panic attack I realized that I have to deal with my past and seek help. I don't want to push people away and miss out of things because of what I went through. I'm just hoping that someone can point me in some sort of direction or give advice on how to trust and open up again.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I would love some insight on this if anyone has advice.\n\nI'm a 26F... I overcame some serious BS last year with an emotionally abusive partner. One of the worst things he would do was give me the silent treatment on purpose. Sometimes for days at a time. He also knew that this was something that particularly bothered me, so it was even more hurtful. Since then, we broke up and I am in a new, happier, healthier relationship. Taking things slow with my new partner and it's been really good. None of the same red flags.\n\nSince this relationship, I have this really weird relationship with text messages, where if someone doesn't answer me, I assume they're mad at me or giving me the \"silent treatment\" on purpose. I don't want to be the annoying friend and ask \"are you mad at me?\" or \"did I do something wrong?\" because that would be...annoying. So the result is that I usually sit at home with my anxiety and it affects the way I go about my day. It distracts me from things I need to do and sometimes affects my ability to fall asleep, since I'm awake and overthinking/analyzing things I could have done wrong. \n\nMy new partner is wonderful.. we talk on the phone and see each other often, and things are moving in a really good/healthy direction. He does absolutely nothing to upset me. But sometimes he won't answer right away and I have to talk to myself and say \"don't freak out, everything is fine\" but sometimes I let my anxiety get the best of me. I KNOW deep down he isn't upset with me, but I can't help but have the same gut reaction as I did with my ex.\n\nI've coined this term \"texting anxiety\" but I don't know if there's a better term for it.\n\nHow can I overcome this? I know it sounds so silly to get worked up over a text message, but it does really get me anxious. Any advice?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

But, those 3 months was something I have never experienced before and I'm still recovering.\n\nFor clarity it was my first relationship and his. We met on an app and things were moving slow in terms of frequency of dates, like one every week, but it was what I wanted. \nSo the third date (week 3) he wanted to cuddle and by the 5th he was trying to get a feel up. On this 5th date I tried to express my discomfort with what he did, and he just deflected about how he's just a little boy inside happy to see boobs. *He literally said this*. And he disregarded everything I was saying because to him \"I didn't say no\". But I didn't say yes. I was honestly overwhelmed and so stunned that I froze. He seemd like he could care less what I said.\n\nBut anyway fast forward to other dates where he just kept minimizing what I said. I didn't want to make out one evening and I made it clear. He said all he wanted to do was cuddle, so I agreed. He then takes off his clothes and lays on me, and for various reasons like safety I just went along with it.\n\nAnd because he kept trying to escalate how physical we were on dates I mentioned to him one evening that I felt like he wasn't curious about me. *Sidenote: he never even asked basic stuff like if I had siblings or when my birthday was*. And because he never asked questions I brought it up. And when I did he would either say how negative I was or give me a minor silent treatment. He later told me his depression caused short term memory loss. He brought his medication and everything. That was the grand explanation for his lack of effort. And he seriously lacked empathy, for me especially. He didn't text or call on my birthday and when I mentioned it he started talking in circles. \n \nI'm so confused because we seemed so similar in the beginning. I emphasize treating people with compassion and kindness and it seemed like he did too. I can't even tell if he has NPD or is just high on the spectrum. He has clinical depression so idk\ud83e\udd37.

It wasn\u2019t our first break up but this one is the last one. \n\nThis was my first real relationship and I loved him so much to the point where I loved him more than myself. I still do even after all what happened. Three months ago I found out he already had a girlfriend but he begged me for forgiveness lying to me saying that he didn\u2019t want her, he loved me, that he was stupid for not breaking up with her sooner because I was alle he wanted. Of course I forgave him and one month later the same thing. He was still with both us but in addition I found out there was a third girlfriend with who he also has been before me. \n\nThen again the beginning and please baby I love you, I can\u2019t sleep without you, I\u2019m crying all day thinking about you, I need you in my life etc came and again I feel for it. He discarded one girlfriend and kept the other girl and me. \n\nThe other girl and I have been in contact the whole time and he didn\u2019t care he just continued to be with both of us. There were times where he would say I want her and then ask me if I cloud give him another chance. We both kept seeing him, telling each other everything but didn\u2019t do anything about it just watched him do everything. This back and forth went on for two months. Can you imagine how sick it actually was? Like we would tell each other every little thing he said or did and just literally lay back and let him do whatever he wanted to. \n\nBut actually the girl and I became really close sharing everything and encouraging each other to leave him. It\u2019s like our friendship was the complete opposite to the relationships we had with him.. with trust, honesty and understanding. He was a cheater and liar. He cheated on the other girl 6 times (they\u2019ve been for over 4 years together), he would always lie even if it wasn\u2019t necessary, he would call both of us sluts and accuse us of cheating, ignore us, he even was physically abusive and gave us both chlamydia he would just hurt us in every way possible. And after all that we both still love him. \n\nA week ago we went together to see him and broke up. He would call us and text us on everything that he could reach us with. He begged to see us both just to talk after being nc for 2 days we agreed and met him. He started to lovebomb the other girl while begging me to not block him everywhere or would pick fights over everything I did. So we both were in contact again he both asked to see us alone again. Then yesterday it was again enough and we went again to see him and broke up for real. \n\nBut this time he wasn\u2019t after us he called a few times but we blocked him everywhere because we both know that we need to go separate ways and that is only possible if he can\u2019t reach us. Today there were only two calls. It kinda hurts because just a few days ago he would text and call us non stop. I had 100+ messages on WhatsApp, around 30 messages on Snapchat, 30 on Facebook, 43 calls and 23 FaceTime calls. \n\nAnd today only two calls. I know it is better that way but it hurts because it seems like he really doesn\u2019t care anymore.. But I kinda want him to be after me.. It just feels so weird and I miss texting and talking with him and him. I feel like I\u2019m going crazy because it\u2019s not normal to love him after everything he has done and after the pain he has caused. And I really feel the urge to just text him and ask him how he is doing because for some reason I can\u2019t stand the thought of him being sad or hurt because of the fact that I left him. I just wish it would have never come to this point where I HAD to leave him not because I wanted to because if I\u2019m honest I could have kept it going with him and just go along with everything as long as I would be with him but I had to because there is no other way to happiness and finally living without constant pain, fear, worries and stress. \n\nI just feel so lost and conflicted because I love him and want him but being with him is not a good (or healthy) option. I just hope as time goes by everything will get back to normal and I will heal from it but at the same time I feel like I will never love someone as much as I love him and never get quite over him.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a really unusual and weird situation with the three of us and the friendship that emerged from it, I know.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

i simply couldn\u2019t.\n\nBefore i start i just want to say that im okay, everything is fine and everything will be fine. \n\nso i had a pretty good family situation, everything was okay from what i remember until my parents got a divorce. the divorce was really hard for everyone, especially the people involved and i understand that what happened is in the past although, i still suffer with some ptsd from it. my dad began to sleep in the guest room, thats when things started feeling off. i always asked my mom why but whenever i did so, she\u2019d tell me it was because he snored too loud. me being a young kid, i believed it and laughed it off. i walked into the guest room one day while my dad was packing a suitcase. my sister came with me. \"im going to pretend to get into a taxi,\u201d he told us, \u201ci\u2019ll be back.\u201d but then, my mom also came into the room and saw what was happening. we had one of those things you usually use to hang up necklaces and she had thrown it at him and started to scream about how he was going to leave us. she started crying and throwing more stuff at him while he sat there, unable to defend himself because he didnt want to end up hitting a woman.\n\nthe rest of that day is a blur and i can only remember what happened when night came. i had gone downstairs to find my parents after being unable to sleep and i noticed that the basement light was on. i opened the door and there was my dad with his hand around my mom\u2019s neck. my mom noticed i was watching and started screaming at me to look what kind of monster he was, to look at what he was doing to her. i ended up running upstairs and my dad followed before putting on a movie for me to watch, it was a batman movie with christian bale. for a couple of months, the fights went on. there was even one where my mom threw a key at the back of my dad\u2019s head. and one where she kicked him while he was picking up some important papers. my dad was having trouble finding a new place to live therefore resulting in him not being able to leave the house permanently.\n\none day i stayed home sick, so i played lego movie the game on my ps4, again, i was a young child so it was just me and my dad in the house as my mom had gone to work. she came back during her lunch break and started to yell at my dad some more which resulted in her getting physical again. i ran away to my neighbors home, wondering if she was home. when i knocked, i was greeted with her sister, who explained to me that she wasnt home with a pencil and some paper, she was deaf. i wrote what was going on and she called the cops for me. she motioned to the phone as soon as a few seconds had gone by, i assumed she was asking if they picked up. i said no and hung up because i was too afraid of what would happen if i had called the cops on my own family. my dad shortly came out to look for me and found me, bringing me back home. my mom even started yelling at me wanting to know if i said anything to our neighbors, i replied with no. \n\na couple months later my dad ended up moving out as he found a place. i lived and still do live with my mother. im very relieved my dad doesnt live with us anymore, and i still do get to see him. things are much better. but what i thought had hopefully been the end, wasn\u2019t. after my dad moved out, my mom would sometimes be really mean to my sister and i. whenever i said \u201cmom\u201d or \u201ccome look at this\u201d she would always roll her eyes. my family, on my moms side, dont really believe in sadness. and they\u2019re also very religious. so whenever im sad about something, my mom\u2019s first words are \"stop overreacting, many people have it worse than you, you\u2019re just a cry baby.\u201d and when i do tell her whats going on, she tries to manipulate the situation and make it seem like she\u2019s the victim in all this. either that or she makes it out to be something totally wrong. i remember when i was at my school\u2019s semi formal and i ended up breaking down in the bathroom because of something i dont want to get into. i called her to pick me up and she started yelling at me and blaming all my friends for what had happened even though that wasnt the case at all, it was my own fault. my mom also blames my sister and i for a lot of stuff that are her doing. like once, she had left some chicken in the oven and she went to a grocery store with us, when we came back, the chicken was burnt and she said it was our fault that it had burnt. she\u2019s also one of those people who are super addicted to their phones, she cant put hers down to even have a conversation with my sister and i. even at the movies, shes constantly on her phone because she doesnt care about the other people trying to enjoy the movie. \n\n\nbefore i get into some other stuff, i just want to bring up that my moms side of the family is full of homophobes, manipulators, racists, and liars. and that she told my sister and i she was going to leave for some radioactive surgery and that she couldnt be around us for a week. long story short, she comes back with a sombrero and t shirts from mexico. \n\n\nmy mom can be very deprecating. and sometimes its really toxic. for example, she says im too thin sometimes and that im too stupid (even though i made it on honour roll). she says im slow and even brought up the r word in an insult. every once in a while, its only happened twice over seven years, she\u2019ll threaten to kill me. it\u2019s really scary but ive been too afraid to talk to anyone about it. i used to have a very good friend and my dads been trying to contact her family but they always give us an excuse when asked to meet up because my mom started some drama with them. she also always wants to make everything about her. she didnt even care when i told her i had scored a 97 on an exam i was too worried about. right after some of the fights, i had made the dumb mistake of texting some friends that i was suicidal. and after the school heard about this, they called my parents and my mom yelled at me about how i should grow up and about how this was ruining her reputation. \n\nnow, onto my dad. my dad never grows tired of telling me that i bother him or stress him out or even bringing up the fact i was an accident. it hurts too much to hear that from someone that\u2019s supposed to love you. he spends a lot of time with his girlfriend, which i understand but he doesnt pay attention to my sister and i at all, i barely see him when its his weekends. my mom also takes any opportunity she can to talk bad about my dad. all of this stuff has had various effects on me and ive never told my therapist about a lot of this because of fear. i feel unloved and uncared about but what can you do, right? im currently counting down the years until i can move out and get away from all of this. i have thought about suicide many times but i dont want to leave my sister to deal with this stuff alone. there\u2019s so much more to this i havent included but most of it\u2019s here. although, if you\u2019d like more details, i\u2019ll be happy to provide them. thank you for taking some time out of your day to read this long post, it means a ton.\n\n\ni just want to conclude this with saying that i dont want to get clout for this, i just want victims to know that you\u2019re much more than your abuse, and one day, things will get better. you\u2019re strong and i love you. please never give up, talk to someone. reach out. things will change.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Seriously, not a soul sees it but me. \n\nI was cleaning up the house after work today and something jumped out at me. Every single damn bathroom drawer and one cabinet is ajar- not wide open, but just ever so close to being shut... I marched into my kitchen and same: 4 drawers and one cabinet almost closed, but not. And as I felt a knot form in my stomach , I knew why.\n\nIt\u2019s the dark and sticky remnants of some of the crazy abuse I suffered while married to my STBX N . Sadly I stuck around, completely unaware and in a fog for ages. And this drawer drama began about 6 years in. \n\nLong ago, wherever I was in the house, at whatever time of day/night- weekend or weekday- didn\u2019t matter, if I closed a drawer or cabinet,  NH would hear it.

The very first time it happened, apparently I woke him as I was getting ready for work. Feeling terrible and in a heap of apologetic, snotty tears, I committed to be quiet. I turned myself inside and out trying to be quiet from then on, (but we all here know that it\u2019s a set up). And then it started happening with the kitchen too.\n\nIf he was watching TV or reading or even worse, taking a nap, opening and even slowly closing a drawer or cabinet was a big stick to the hornets\u2019 nest. And God forbid I would unload the dishwasher lol...\n\nJust about every style or approach was a fail and brought another round of assault. So how did I cope? I quit closing everything. I became so effin stealthy. It wasn\u2019t conscious, as no lightbulb rang above my head. I was in the throes of the worst of NH\u2019s abuse streak and something had to go right. And it did. Eventually NH must have grown weary of that fun and took up terrorizing me for something else just as silly and small. \n\nBut today was different. I surveyed my open everything and I cried because although nobody is here to pin me to a wall or scream until my ears ring, I am still am gripped by both the tiniest and most ginormous reminder that I have been brutally abused by my NH. \n\nSometimes the biggest reminders come by way of a whisper. And do y\u2019all want to know what I did after today\u2019s cleansing cry?\n\nI slammed every last one of those drawers and cabinets so loudly that I thought they\u2019d come right off the hinges or track. And wherever the STBNH is in the world, I sure as hell hope he heard it. \n\nWishing peace and healing to us all.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The last time I tried to break up with him A LOT OF TIMES and he would say things such as me being coward for not wanting to try or that I was using him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cheated on him to finally escape once and for all. It didn't stop there, he messaged the new person I was with and sending evidences that I cheated with him, the new person was aware that I was in an unstable relationship. They also happened to have mutual friends so there's that. He told all our friends that I was a cheater and etc. and most of them cut off ties with me or avoid me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were on-off mostly cos his friends were usually rude to me and he'd make excuses for them, when we would fight he would tell me i triggered him to say mean things or to lose temper. and that i felt like he didnt really stand up for me. also, he always tries to act like a victim in every fight or that he acts like no one else struggles in life like he does. i don't know like he always exaggerates situations and how he's always the victim. he always tells me his friends care too much about him and it's a bit disturbing as he's making it seem like his friends devote their lives into caring for his well-being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBrief background: We were together for a year and a half. I cut contact for about 2-3 months but then he started up showing up to where I usually hangout. We share the same community although we were in long-distance. It also doesn't help that we play the same video game and well, we share the same circle there as well and it's a very indie game so everyone knows each other. I still play the video game and he has also started showing up there again. I don't want to quit something I enjoy just because of an ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then we started talking again, some circumstances make it inevitable and it felt like I just hit a restart on whatever progress I have made, like I'm relapsing. We're having sex and hanging out but I know it's not right especially when he told our mutual friends my secrets and about my mental health.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am hooked to the good feeling because when things are good, they're really good. he spoils me when we're okay even with expensive material things like high-end brands. but when they're bad, they're really bad. Like he takes back gifts, calls me names and tells me to pay him back for our dates and stuff he got me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been going to therapy and it takes a while especially that my previous therapist was not exactly helpful and kept suggesting me to go to a workshop or pottery class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI FEEL TRAPPED AND HAVE ZERO CONTROL. It's like I can't grow a backbone and stand-up for myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry if this is so messy I'm just really not in a good state right now.

It was legit one of the best nights of my life, we kissed, and she told me she thought it felt 'meant to be'. \n\nWithin the next week she had said she would marry me, that she loved me, and that we should go travelling together. We also slept together pretty quickly - something she said she doesn't normally do. We carried on with the crazy intensity, she told me about her past stuff, saying she had never told anyone it before, and I carried on having the best days of my life with her. \n\nMy mental health took a beating during all this (happy to go into this, not just to do with her), initially she was quite supportive but over time made it clear she didn't like dealing with it etc. And throughout the relationship she would tell me she struggled to be in a relationship, but wanted to try for me, despite her strong proclamations (saying we are soulmates etc) I never went to her house, she didn't want people from our work to know (claims she was a private person) and I never met any of her friends or family. Several times she said I could go to her house, but everytime something happened so I couldn't. \n\nAnyway I returned to work at a new job after some time off, and things suddenly changed.

The up and down behaviour continued till I couldn't take it anymore, we had a big argument, were basically breaking up, and this ended with her breaking down, saying she had failed me, that losing me from her life would be like losing a limb, and begging me not to abandon her. \n\nMy MH took a further decline, I started having thoughts about not wanting to live anymore, I shared this with her and she flipped at me, saying I was being negative, selfish and manipulative, came over, had a go at me, then left me physically (this happened twice). \n\nAnd we have now broken up but are still talking, and that is a very quick summary of everything - thoughts?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Met girl, fell madly in love, it all went wrong, think she might be a narcissist?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I probably need counseling. I probably need to talk to someone. And I probably need to learn to just be alone. \n\nSo my story is ... I was with a narc for 8-years. We have two kids together. Shit got really, really, really bad. He got kicked out then relocated with family. Within 7-8 months, he found a new woman, moved in with her and just yeah .. started a brand new life and never looked back. He doesn't call or send anything to our two kids. He's just disappeared &amp; moved on. \n\nDuring all this chaos, I was sharing my pain with a mutual friend of ours. Eventually this friend stopped being friends/communicating with my nex. He felt bad for me and wanted so badly to help me. He was a great friend. He listened, made me laugh, told me personal stories, reminded me of my strength, etc. \n\nAfter a year of talking .. this friend confessed he was 'in love' with me. But it was complicated because 'said friend' is married. However, their marriage has been on the rocks. He doesn't live with his spouse. But neither of them have really discussed divorce. I told him that I had feelings for him and I'd be patient with him. I told him I wanted to see where this love/feelings stuff led. At first I was pretty apprehensive and reserved because I didn't want to get hurt or too emotional invested.\n\nOf course this led to us talking constantly ... sharing ideas, plans, feelings, etc. Phone calls throughout the day, video chats and late night (2am/3am) phone calls. Of course we wanted to 'hook up'. But the two of us live like 1,000-miles apart. So I made plans to travel across the country to see him for a weekend, to hook up, to hang out, etc. \n\nIt was a total let down. I feel duped in a way. It was nice to see him and some other friends in the area. But .. it just wasn't what it was all cracked up to be. \n\nThere's a lot of feelings attached to this post, but these are my main take aways from the hook-up: (1) I felt rushed. (2) I didn't feel like his priority, in that he was having me run him around to friend's houses or wait to see him. (3) The sex was definitely not the best hahaha (although I realize my nex had me so addicted to him, his sex, that intensity .. that I knew going into any new hookup it'd be hard not to compare)  (4) I felt like he failed me on his promises of what our time was going to be like together. (5) on the last day together instead of spending until the last minute we could together, he left me early to go be with friends and then only called me once while I sat at a hotel by myself. :(\n\nNow that I'm back home; he's really stopped calling me. No late night calls. Maybe one video call a day. Maybe only 2-3 calls a day at all. I'm told NOT to call him but to wait for him to call me. :( It sucks because I actually HELPED him get this damn cellphone so he didn't have to feel bad using his spouse's shit. Plus I thought I would be able to talk to him MORE and call him/text him just have normal communication with him if he had his own cellphone. So it's a HUGE SLAP in my face to know he won't let me call and gets annoyed if I do. He keeps 'reminding' me that *you knew what this was/you knew my situation* And **I can't call the phone**???! Like, seriously, WTF!?!!!\n\nNot to mention ... I have helped him financially in some ways and just yeah tried to be an overly good friend. A big part of me feels like I got used. I feel like he isn't going to live up to any of the promises he's professed to me. \n\nA part of me wonders if I just walked into another situation with a narc .. just not as overt as my ex? I get this feeling that this guy is super *selfish* and that actually turns me all the way off. Like, everything has to be his way, on his terms, when he says/wants it done, you know? \n\nFor example .. he'd been trying to convince me to move across country to be closer to me. Suggesting I relocate my kids and he'd help me take care of them and get settled. He wants me in his life but he's not about to leave his wife outright for me .. at least yet. But seems like smoke and mirrors cause until you do it -- well, you haven't done it so I may just always be the mistress, you know? Plus, what is his impression now that he's had me? Seems like he's doesn't want me as close to him now?\n\nFuck. I don't know now. I feel like I got tricked. I feel like I'm still not sure what 'healthy' is ... I feel like I interjected myself into someone's life that now doesn't quite want me in their life. And, lastly..I just don't feel \"loved\" and that's all I want ... that love and respect. I love and respect so that's all I desire. So how do I feel love and respect IF I can't even communicate on my own terms with this person you wants to have those things with me? (Or says at least he wants it)\n\nTL;DR -- I hooked up with an old, mutual friend of the nex and me. This friend was \"all about me\" then when we hooked up .. it just feels awkward and I feel like I'm acting SUPER clingy and he wants me on his terms which is very possessive in a way. I can't call him on his phone (must wait for his calls) but he doesn't want me dating or talking to guys. Essentially, I am \"his girl\" but he's technically still married (although separated) but hasn't indicated if divorce is a certainty in the near future. He used to ask me to move closer to him but now I just don't even know what the fuck we are OR if I walked myself back into a narc relationship/dynamic. \n\nHELP unravel this shitshow!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I earn an above-average salary, had saved about two months worth of salary, and had paid down and opened even more credit cards to help with the initial \"building out\" of our new place.\n\nI spent almost ALL of our money and probably double what I had intended.  Some of this I'm sure has been \"emotional\" in nature, since I had the resources and one of her control mechanisms was on the finances I purchased a few things that were a bit \"over the top\" that I had wanted to purchase for years.  Not counting those items we came in about what I expected.\n\nWe built out a private Amazon wishlist of everything we'd need, right down to a new toilet plunger, so we were able to save and prep.\n\nWe moved with three pieces of furniture, a TV, our personal electronics, and our clothes/books.  That was pretty much it so we had a lot to purchase.\n\nHaving the Amazon list helped since we were able to arrive and then place the Amazon order for the things we could wait for and then go to the store for the things we couldn't wait for but the pricing and expense were already known.\\\\\n\nNow it's been a month.\n\nLogistically we are 100% settled and need nothing.\n\nSo what's it been like?\n\nI was making a salad with my youngest who spontaneously said he was so glad we moved and was so happy.  I asked why and he pointed to the balsamic vinegar and said that he realized he wouldn't get yelled at for using the wrong balsamic  (aged 15 years vs aged 30 years, it was a big deal in the old house) when making a salad dressing.\n\nAnd these types of spontaneous appreciative moments have come often from both boys.\n\nMy oldest has begun practicing his saxophones again, he was previously banned from playing in the house, and has started to cook again.  He's starting culinary school in another month and landed an AMAZING job at a crazy fancy and expensive organic farm to table restaurant that plays jazz in the background.  His long term goal is to open a fancy jazz club.  He was hired as a dishwasher and the day before he was scheduled to start as a dishwasher was asked if he could come in to \"work the line\" since someone was out.  He then worked one day as a dishwasher and was promoted to working in the kitchen assisting the chef.\n\nPersonally, I've found myself just so much more relaxed and productive. \n\nI have an almost 100% flexible schedule as a university professor who teaches all of my courses online.  I hadn't realized how far behind I was at work.  Within a month I've caught up.  And by September I should be comfortably ahead.\n\nMoreover, I have been able to \"hit the coffee shop\" in the mornings to do all of the work that is \"time-bound\" such as grading student work and reaching out to students.  I am done this \"time-bound\" work usually by noon each day and then go extra flexible.  Several days have included long bike rides with the kids and more than one late afternoon at the beach.  On one of these rides, I realized that I was 100% at peace and just content.\n\nThis sense of calm is the most dramatic.  Now that I have been feeling calm and content I am remembering the times I felt like this in the past.  I had completely forgotten what this felt like.\n\nThe last time I went through something like this, yes I'm foolish enough to have gone through this twice, I was very financially unstable, younger, and fearful of what others would think of me raising my boys alone without a mother.\n\nThis time we're in a better position.\n\nThe year of saving money helped.\n\nThe stable job helped more.\n\nAnd moving into an apartment that is super small, has me sleeping on the living room couch, but is $500 less each month than the others we looked at really adds a sense of ease.\n\nThe only two real expenses left are culinary school and an eBike so he can get to cullinary school.  Tuition is going to run us, after financial aid, about $1,500 a semester, and the eBike we are looking at is about $1,500 and should reduce his need for a car to just when it rains.  The plan is that I pay that and he uses his paycheck to take care of the main grocery bill, Netflix, and helps with random incidentals.  And of course, he's expected to save his money as much as possible.\n\nI think the largest change has been the levels of comfort, confidence, and ease that I just wasn't expecting.\n\nEach of us has realized that we can be happy.  And that we can indeed make our dreams come true.\n\nWith some effort, I'm hoping to pay off all of my \"non-student-loan\" debt by Christmas and then to start saving as much as possible in preparation for building the life that we should have been living had I gotten us out sooner.\n\nIf you're feeling trapped.  There is an exit.  You can get out.  Gaining your independence again is 100% worth it.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

We love each other very much and we have our good and bad times. \n\nCutting straight to the point: his abusive behaviour started with yelling, then escalated to throwing things and/or breaking them out of anger, and last week, he pushed me while having an argument. Whenever he does something aggressive, he says it's my fault because I made him super angry and drove him to a point where he can't control himself anymore. And then, the next day or so, he comes back to me and says he's sorry, he didn't mean it and that he will try to change. \n\nI always warned him that he was following a pattern, and that ultimately he will lay his hands on me, but until the pushing incident, he never believed me. \n\nLast week, after he pushed me, I told him I wanted to break up with him. After a lot of talking, crying, etc. I agreed to continue the relationship if he will actively start changing. He agreed if he ever got violent again that he'll start looking for proffessional help. \n\nToday, while fighting, I noticed he was starting to bend/break something of ours. I knew that he was back to his old ways of violence. When I confronted him about that, he said he was just playing with it, but ultimately admitted that \"I had made him so angry\" he started to break it. \n\nNow he doesn't even want to admit that he has an abusive pattern and is trying to blame everything wrong with the relationship on me. He doesn't believe he has a problem and thinks I am using the word \"abuser\" too liberally. \n\nI am afraid he'll never change. How can I convince him this is a problem? If he does believe it in the end, will he ever stop? Has anyone heard of abusers fixing this problem?\n\nI really love him and we were planning our future together, kids and everything.

He was really upset, which wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary, he was usually really depressed and would call her to complain about his family/life. What was unusual was the quality of his distress.

I have endured years of trying to help him change and help him not be a victim but what I have realized over the last 9 months is that he won\u2019t change nor does he think he needs to. In his eyes I have done nothing to help him or support him. In his mind I have been the verbally abusive one, the one to prioritize my work over our family (I am the only one working), even though I come home every night at 5pm and then do all of the household chores, fix dinner and get our children to bed. I know I have struggled with codependency for years and that struggle is why I sit here today feeling so very guilty. Guilty because I am taking care of me and what I need to be healthy. Guilty because he will blame me for the rest of my life for abandoning him and what he perceives is ruining our kids lives. I know the truth, I am a good person, a great mom and have been a good partner but the little voice inside of me (his voice of never being good enough) keeps telling me I\u2019m a horrible person for doing this to someone else. When does the pendulum swing towards us and our needs? When will i feel at peace with putting my happiness and my desire to show my boys a life of self love and respect above the unfair needs of a dysfunctional, loveless, unhealthy relationship? I am in therapy every week working on this but hoping for some support from others who have gone through this.\n\nI\u2019m scared for what tomorrow will bring. The last few months,after I told him I was unhappy, has brought so much verbal abuse and emotional torture. I am mentally preparing for the smear campaign that I know will happen. He doesn\u2019t love me, he doesn\u2019t even like me. He likes the stability I bring to his life, he likes that I am there as the caregiver for the kids so he can enjoy them as he pleases. I\u2019m so worried he will take off with my kids or do self harm. I have family I can stay with and they offer so often for me to go but my husband threatens to call the police if I take the kids. I do not want anymore trauma for the kids. I do not want to feel like a burden camping at someone else\u2019s house. I have worked so hard to get myself to a place in my career that I can be self sufficient and I just want that. Why won\u2019t he just let me go?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My husband has been struggling for a long time with trust. He is extremely suspicious of me with no cause whatsoever.  He is paranoid about it all the time.  He just started going to therapy he knows he has a problem.  A few days ago, he thought he caught me in a lie (he didn\u2019t it was a misunderstanding) and he snapped.  We were on our patio and I was sitting on the step.  He got up and threw his chair and then grabbed me threw me to the ground, I scraped my hand and my head.  He hit me in the arm (not a punch and not super hard more like with his arm).  He snatched me glasses off my face and kept cocking his fist back like he was going to punch me.  This is the first time he has ever done anything like this.  He grabbed me a squeezed my arms once but honestly that was nothing and didn\u2019t register for me as abuse.  This was scary.  I was frightened.  Thankfully he got control of himself before he did anything really bad but this obviously crossed a line that has never been crossed in the almost 10 years we\u2019ve been together.   I know everyone is going to say I should leave because he\u2019s going to do it again.  I\u2019m looking for other options.  I love him very much and I don\u2019t want to leave.  So if that\u2019s your only advice, thank you for your concern but please don\u2019t waste your thumb power.  Is there any hope for this getting better?  He promised he would tell his therapist this week and ask him for resources to help him with his anger like some kind of recovery program.  I\u2019m just devastated and i already have ptsd so I\u2019m really fucked up right now.  I\u2019m not mad at him in just so disappointed in us.  I thought we had something so special that we could break the cycle of abuse (his family has been a long line of abusers).  I\u2019m afraid to tell anyone.  I told his mom but that was it.

He came on pretty strong, texting me every day until we met. I almost called our date off because I felt weird chit chatting so much with someone I hadn\u2019t even met yet. \n\nOur first few dates went great. He even called me once during the week in between to hear about my day. He was a perfect gentleman, basically did everything exactly how I like my dates to do things, even though I hadn\u2019t told him any of that. \n\nHe asks me about myself a lot and doesn\u2019t talk too much about himself unless I prod him. \n\nOn our fourth date, we went bar patio hopping because the weather was nice... we met up around 3pm. He tells me he had a really shitty last few days and a lot of things are stressing him out. \n\nAt about 8:30, he suggests that I invite my close (gay) friend out that he\u2019s heard a lot about, since I had just received a text from him. I said nah it\u2019s okay, we\u2019re out together. But he seemed really interested in meeting him. So they meet and get along fine... long story short his demeanor changed while we were out and we both had had many drinks over the night. My friend left and when my date was walking me to my car (parked right under his brother\u2019s apt where he was dog sitting and had the whole place to himself), he suddenly got really mad and said \u201cwe have communication issues,\u201d and that we couldn\u2019t continue to date because I\u2019m making zero effort in getting to know him. \n\nI was completely blindsided, and tried to ask him what he meant. He tried to say goodbye, and then I told him that I was too drunk to drive and it was 1am. He told me to call him when I \u201cfigure my shit out\u201d, and then left me on the street next to my car and didn\u2019t even turn back or text to ask if I got home okay. Thankfully my friend was still up and came back to give me a ride (he\u2019s sober). \n\nMy date texted me the next morning saying that I use the excuse that I\u2019m shy, and again that I make zero effort in trying to get to know him and that he\u2019s the only one trying. I tried calling him so we could talk about it and he never responded... until today. \n\nHe texted this morning saying that he\u2019s trying to give me space and that we left things weird and he understands if I don\u2019t want to continue things. \n\nIs he a narc, or just had a bad night and was an asshole? I should mention that he told me his ex was basically an alcoholic and used to hit him, and asked to be driven everywhere and picked up from clubs after she got a DUI. \n\nI\u2019m so bummed because he felt like the perfect match for me until he got mad on the fourth date and left me drunk and alone on the street. \n\nTDLR: new guy treated me super well and seemed perfect for me, got mad and tried to break things off on the fourth date (saying I wasn\u2019t putting in enough effort into getting to know him) and left me drunk and alone on the street. Now he\u2019s texting and saying we left things weird and he understands if I don\u2019t want to continue seeing him.

My mom wants to divorce him and then my mom, my adult brother, and my adult self could all cut him out of our lives before he kills us. She is scared to do it though because she thinks he\u2019ll come after her. My brother and I want to talk to her this Sunday and tell her that if she does not leave she will probably die and if she still doesn\u2019t leave then I have to sadly abandon her in order to take care of my self. Tips or suggestions on what to say and how to say it?\n\nI\u2019ll try to condense as much as possible but theres a lot of important backstory so it will likely still be a wall of text. My dad\u2019s side of the family has a long history of abuse. My third great grandfather was 25 when he married a 13 year old orphan girl around 1890. From then on all the men on that side have inflicted horrifically sadistic sexual abuse on their children. My dad never sexually abused me or my brother, but he was incredibly emotionally abusive. We went to a very cult like church that reinforced his having complete control over all our lives. I grew up thinking it was normal. When I was nineteen I realized that I didn\u2019t actually believe in god and became an atheist.  About a year and a half later my mom found evidence that my dad had been using my brothers college money to pay for hookers. Dad and our church had conditioned me to think that we were the perfect christian family. It was one of those double think things. I knew deep down that something was deeply wrong with our family dynamic, but I could not admit it to myself because everyone was telling me we were a happy family. Learning that my dad could be such a blatant monster shattered my illusion of our perfect little family, and I very hastily moved out. I literally moved in with the first people who would rent with me. That turned into a fiasco and about a year later I moved all my stuff back to my parents house when both room mates were at work because I was scared for my safety if they had seen me. (The room mates had started yelling and almost assaulting me whenever they saw me about two weeks before this, so I had been leaving and entering the house through my bedroom window) my parents had bought a small rundown house in the next town over for my aunt and uncle to rent to own, but it turned out my uncle is a meth head, so they had to evict him. My dad strongly pressured me to move in there and rent from them, so that\u2019s where I\u2019m living now. Since the time I moved out of my parents house I\u2019ve been expecting my parents to get a divorce. At first my mom was dead set on getting divorced as soon as possible, but then I think my dad convinced her to go to counciling. He suddenly became devout again in his christianity, and was constantly crying in front of us (which were crocodile tears). About 2 months after he got caught he pretty much dropped the religious zealot act and went back to not going to church and yelling \u201cjesus f*cking christ\u201d whenever something didn\u2019t go his way. Now almost two years after he\u2019s been caught, he\u2019s slipping back into his old habits. He\u2019s been slowly easing back into it so he would still have a hold on my mom but she wouldn\u2019t notice when he dropped the whole act and was back to being his fully abusive self again. He spys on her phone, he gaslights her, and manipulates her, he quite possibly hits her because she\u2019s always got bruises on her legs and arms that \u201cjust show up\u201d, he came up with the idea of them opening a store together, and now she runs the store 50 hours a week and has little time to do what she wants or even go outside or talk to other people besides customers, he makes her do all the housework because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel appreciated\u201d when he does something small like load the dish washer and turn it on. My mom has been confiding in me more lately and she is suicidal all the time. She wants desperately to leave but she\u2019s scared of what my dad will do. I know my description of him doesn\u2019t sound all that bad but he is 100% a psychopath and he has a crazy ability to set things up so he has control over you. If you try to break free he gets unpredictable. Once in sixth grade I accidentally put a scratch on his mini van with my bike and he took off work the next day so he could pick me up from school instead of my mom. He had bought an air soft pistol and painted over the orange part so that to a sixth grader who know nothing about guns it looks real. He put it in the passenger seat so I\u2019d have to move it when I got in. He was on the phone, and you never made any noise or tried signaling to him when he was on the phone or he would scream at you so I stayed quiet. Instead of driving to our house he started driving out into the middle of nowhere saying things to the person on the other end like \u201cI\u2019m going out far enough that no one will hear him.\u201d \u201cNo he\u2019s pretty small so I won\u2019t have to dig that much.\u201d Etc. As I was about to open the door and jump out he hung up and starts laughing and going \u201cyou thought it was real?!\u201d The man is insane and I genuinely believe that if he\u2019s not already a serial killer, then he will become one. The way I see things moving right now either my mom will kill herself, or my dad will do it for her and make it look like suicide. I\u2019ve been telling my mom she needs to get out, but she keeps making excuses. \u201cHe\u2019s so smart he\u2019ll figure out how to sue me\u201d \u201cWhat will happen to the store?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I can take care of myself on the outside.\u201d My brother and I are going to make a final effort to get her to see the gravity of her situation and then after that I fear I\u2019m going to have to abandon her. I need to get away from my dad, and if my mom won\u2019t leave him then that means I have to leave her too or risk my own safety. My brother and I are planning on talking to my mom next Sunday when my dad is at work. Does anyone have any tips on what should be said and how? I certainly don\u2019t want to say the wrong thing and end up driving her back to my dad. Thank you!", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Most of that has been spent pretty LDR due to his past employment, and when we have lived together, it's been pretty volatile with frequent arguments, drama, etc, and now seven years later, I feel like I've completely given up hope for this working out. I nearly pulled the plug back in March, but H convinced me to give it another shot and do couples counseling so I agreed.   \n\n\nIt's only been a few months, and our therapist thought it would be a good idea for us to do individual counseling first, so that's what I've been doing. We've discussed my feelings regarding the relationship and why I feel the way I do, but it feels like I've never been able to adequately explain myself to her. I can't pinpoint what about it gives me a bad feeling. Just something about the way H is/treats me. Because of that, I don't feel a whole lot has been accomplished in there other than discussing childhood trauma, me potentially having ADD and maybe that's why he's so frustrated with me (because I can never remember anything and easily distracted), and working on loving myself or something idk. When I tried to break up again with H a month ago, she told H that she doesn't understand why we're giving up yet and that she didn't think we haven't reached the breaking point, so she convinced me to hang on. But i'm really struggling.    \n\n\nWell I feel like I'm going crazy, and crazy for doing this, but during a pretty typical fight with H I just snapped. Since I have such a \"bad memory\", I decided to write down everything said and done in our fights in order to refer back to them when he decided to bring it up in future arguments. But now that everything is written on paper, I see patterns that scare me and I had never noticed before. I googled emotional abuse and i have sooooo much I can relate to in nearly every bullet point. And the pages I've written! So many pages. Thing is, I'm not really sure if that's what I'm experiencing or if I'm just blowing everything out of proportion? I'm afraid that i'm crazy or that I'm fabricating things or that i'm just trying to find an excuse to get out of this relationship. Idk. I thought I'd list some examples and see what people think??   \n\\--\n\nThis happened yesterday. \n\nH comes home from work for a bit to shower before he heads to his second job. He asks me to shower with him and I said I need to do yard work and workout still so I didn't want to shower yet. I tell him that he can shower real quick and join me in the living room so we can spend some time together. He says no, that he won't have time, and just kinda sulks to the bathroom. After, he's dressing in the bedroom and I come to talk to him. I ask him what's wrong (cause he's acting distant and cold with me) and he says \"nothing.\" and continues dressing. I bring up an incident from the previous night regarding a thief stealing something. H asks if I have the footage and I say I do so I pull it up. Before i'm able to show him he asks something like \"were/are the cars there?\" I replied yes. So he asked \"can't the police ID him via his license plate?\" Realizing I had misunderstood his question (he was asking if the thief had a car) I corrected by saying there was no car, and I thought he was referring to our cars. He rolled his eyes and scoffed, \"Well **obviously** I was talking about the thief's car.\" I brush it off and go upstairs, not trying to engage with him. He asks why I'm leaving and I said I didn't appreciate how he was talking to me. He replied, \"Well it **was** obvious.\" \n\nUpstairs, I start cleaning a mess that a dog had made. As i'm grabbing paper towels, he approaches me in the pantry to talk before he leaves. I tell him to just wait one sec as I'm cleaning this mess. He grabs me by my shoulders and kinda holds me in the pantry so I can't move past him ( to hug or kiss me idk) and I tell him to please let go of me. He gets angry and storms outside saying \"sorry for just trying to give you some love this entire time.\" I notice as he's pulling away in the car that he's driving a new car. I ask him whose car this was and he said \"mine.\" I asked him to clarify and he just stayed silent. I asked again and he said \"it's mine. I told you about this.\" Super confused, I was like no??? And he said, \"The 15th. I told you about this. Do you not remember?\" I said no. He rolled his eyes and said, \"this is what I mean. even your mom knows this cause I asked for her help with something.\" Finally remembering he mentioned a month ago that his car would be in the shop, I told him I must've forgot. He just smirks and nods his head and goes to work. Later I ask my mom if she remembered and she said no? And asked if he had reminded anyone. Nope.   \n\\_\\_\n\nTo include to that:   \n\n\n1.  Persistently negative and complains about others, how entitled and stupid people are. Refers to \"dumb college students\" as \"your people\" when talking to me, referred to some girl in a movie we were watching as \"that fat pig\", said a girl in a popular meme \"seems pretty cunt-ish\" ( threw a fit when I asked him why he'd say that about someone. Says I just attack him and he's not allowed to have an opinion about people around me). Everyone at every job he's ever had has been stupid or incompetent. He (without saying the actual words) is the most capable, competent, and intelligent worker they have. Tends to experience a lot of drama at work with boss (they always dislike him). \n2. Comments during fights: \"why don't you just leave/ we just get a divorce then?\" \"I know you don't really love me or want me anyway.\" \"I know you don't want me around.\" \"I know you don't give a shit about me.\" \"I could die tomorrow and everyone would be better off/would be happy/wouldn't notice.\" \"you all clearly hate me and want me gone (referring to family).\" \"Sorry I'm such a shit husband/never good enough for you - I'll just get out of your life to not bother you anymore.\" \"You'd be happy if I died cause then you'd get money/be happy.\"   \n\n3. Following fights, especially after our near-splits, will act especially sweet, bend over backwards to do me favors, open doors, make food, run me a bath, get me gifts, etc. Things will be okay for awhile, but it feels that length of time is less and less now.   \n\n4. Wakes me up to \"love on me\" but it really feels like to just get sex. Tries to coerce me into it. Asking me over and over and over and whining/begging. If I say no, he'll ask why not. Will keep asking why not? Either I say no and he gets grumpy about it and say \"we never have sex\" or just give in out of guilt (our sex life has really slowed since the beginning). \n5. Arguments are circular and never-ending - or the complete opposite and he refuses to discuss the issue. He is always right. It's always my opinion that's wrong or flawed, or i'm just not seeing things correctly, or i'm just not remembering things correctly, or I \"have no idea what I'm talking about and know nothing about it.\" Whines, sulks, pouts. Storms out of the room/house/bed if I keep arguing back. Says I just don't ever listen to him and that I don't hold myself to the same standards that I hold him, so that's why we have these issues. Tells me to stop apologizing when I do because \"an apology is worth nothing when you keep repeating the same behavior over and over. If you really cared, you'd stop doing it.\" Says I never doing anything for him or this relationship, says that he's done all the changing for this relationship and wishes I'd do my part. Has fought me in public even when I tell him to wait until we're in private and that it's embarrassing, but he just gets frustrated and storms off. Claims I'm shitty/abusive partner and has called me a sociopath/narcissist before. Told me i'm \"just fabricating thing\" when I told him that I feel like I have to walk on eggshells around him and that our counselor would agree with him. \n6. His account of or opinion on anything is law:  \"i don't want to insult your intelligence, honey, but you honestly have no idea what you're talking about. You don't know anything on ---.\" \"you're just not remembering correctly. You just don't listen to me. That didn't happen that way, what happened was... I didn't say that, you did.\" \n7.  Seems unconcerned/cold/distant when i'm crying and upset during arguments. Only comes to comfort me once the argument is over or I have been thoroughly destroyed and am hysterical. \n8.  If I bring up concerns or defend myself, i'm just attacking him. Will usually end up with him upset, usually lecturing me on how I don't listen or take responsibility for my part \n9.  If in a store, will physically drag me away (in the guise of joking) from things I'm looking at saying \"you don't need it.\" Super embarrassing in public and when I tell him that looks bad, he just laughs it off  \n\n10. It feels like everything entertainment-wise that I, and only I, enjoy can't be played around him because he hates it and it's \"absolutely terrible.\" I have to change it to something \"we both enjoy.\" When I ask why we can't just compromise and listen to each other's music once in awhile, he said that changing it to something we both like (lol) is already compromise. Nevermind the fact that we watch his horror movies all the time even after I've told him I don't really like them. He just throws a fit and says he never gets to watch his movies/ never want to spend time with him because I always hate the movies he picks. Or will beg until I usually just say fine. I can't play my music in the car with him because he'll complain it's awful and will sulk/complain until I change it.   \n\n\nHonestly there is so much more, but I'm just exhausted. So exhausted that no matter if this is abuse or not, I just can't deal with him anymore. I have run this over and over and over through my head, and I though it's so blatantly clear on paper, I still can't convince myself this is what's happening. He has made me feel like the inconsiderate, childish, inconsiderate, and sociopathic one so much that I believe it. I feel like I'm just nitpicking his behavior to find something to weaponize. I feel like I'm the abusive one. I feel like I'm making it all up. And i'm so, so tired. All the time. I haven't been able to eat or sleep, and I'm so on edge whenever he's around. I just pray for him to go to work again so that I can feel some relief. Ugh.\n\nMy next appt with the counselor is in two weeks, so I have to wait that long to bring this all up to her. To show her all that I've written down. I'm afraid she's not going to believe me, especially since I've been seeing her for months and haven't mentioned this stuff. I'm afraid that I have been in the wrong this entire time. I'm afraid she's just going to side with H.   \n\n\nWhat now?   \n\n\nTl;DR: Concerned H is emotionally abusive but not entirely convinced yet. I really don't know how to summarize this, sorry.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I always only though of him as a friend because I knew he had a girlfriend and I respected that. Everyone at work would always mentioned that he had a big crush on me but I didn't pay it any mind cause I saw it as gossip. He was a good friend. Always there for me to listen to me vent because I've been going through a lot of crap with my family. And always comforted and helped me. He always brightened my day and told me how beautiful it perfect I was and always made me feel better. We actually never hung out outside of work because he said his girlfriend didn't want him hanging around me, he could never give me a ride home or anything. One day I was stranded at work late at night cause my moms car broke down and I didn't have Uber money. He was the only one able to take me home. When we got to my place he asked me to wait so he could open the car door for me. When I got out he gave me a hug and kissed me u expectedly. I kissed him back although I knew it was wrong ( I've been very vulnerable going through issues like being homeless). After the kiss I said you need to get back to your gf and left. The next day he texted me apologizing and wanted to apologize in person even though I said it wasn't necessary. But I agreed to meet up with him to talk. He told me that it could never happen again, and how he liked me but loved his gf more. He said that he's had strong feelings for me since he first met me. And how I'm perfect, funny, intelligent, and I make him happy to come to work. And that if he wasn't with his gf he would be with me. Even after saying all that he tried kissing me again but I walked off angry that he tried to still get physical even though he died he loves his gf more. \n\nSince that happened I stopped talking to him and acting like he didn't exist at work. He admitted to his gf what he did and he took time off from work. He can't back and I decided to forgive him and not dwell on the past. When I was taking out trash and we were by ourselves he told me how his gf broke up with him and he wanted and he kissed me. He started taking me out on dates and hanging out with each other a lot. And also making out. We had sex once. Then 2 weeks later he tells me that his ex came back to him crying about how the guy she left him for broke up with her. And how she was devastated and wanted to work on their relationship. He said that he really likes me a lot but has to distance himself from me so that he can stop wanting me so badly, so that he can be with his gf. I feel used and feel worthless like I'm not good enough. If he is attracted to me and likes me so much why make himself be with his ex? He said that he wasn't using me and wants to work stiff out with his ex that was his first gf for 2 years. He said any guy would be lucky to have me. But when I stay away and ignore his calls he tries contacting me. And he is trying to downplay his attraction to me saying I made all the first moves and he did all that just cause I wanted to be with him first. I never treated him like anything but a friend before all of this but now he's pushing it all on me. He even said that his heart wasn't in it with the sex and he only had sex cause I wanted to but he's the one who mentioned how badly he wanted to have sex not me!!! I want revenge so bad and I'm trying not to act on it. I was so close to vandalizing his car yesterday, it was so hard to stop myself. I've always been told how attractive I am by guys my whole life but my self esteem had went down since this has happened. I feel worthless and thrown away by him like garbage. I cry everyday. I feel horrible and want revenge. How can I get over this? I'm also in a new state and he was my only friend so I feel alone. my family isn't supportive either.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He would not outright say that his was intent was to sleep with me despite knowing I was married with a kid....all in his house. He would blow up at me many times after he finally came forward about his true intentions and I told him firmly my answer was no. He continued emotional abuse and manipulation by threatening to kick me out and then saying that he didnt really mean it. Being mad because I wouldnt want to touch him, I use physical distance as a coping mechanism due to sexual assault I experienced when I was younger. He didn't stop his persuit of an inappropriate relationship with me, threatened to call CPS on me when I left and stayed in a hotel, he would use manipulation to try and coax me to promise to a relationship he wanted by saying things like \"what if your husband died, would you consider me?\" It all came to a head and we finally were able to move out. He still wanted to be close to me (abusers will try to maintain access to the people they abuse) and came over every day and threw a fit when I put distance between him and I. Today was the day I kicked him out of my house after he said that I led him on because I made a couple of inappropriate jokes shortly after we moved in with him, he went on to say that a large percentage of women get sexually assaulted in the military (knowing I am former military) probably because they \"act, dress, or joke a certain way\" I asked them if they deserved to get sexually assaulted because of that and he said \"yes, they do, if they want to act like whores\". That was the last straw, I blew up and kicked him out of my house and told him to stay away from my child.

I had tried so many times to tell her I was done but she always pulled me back in. God did I love her. She was so broken but so lovely. All I wanted to do was show her that she was worthy of love- that she could trust in my heart. \n\nI started out so strong. I let the things she did go. She had a major drinking problem. Now obviously she had some deep seated issues she was coping with so I decided to just be there as a positive influence around alcohol without being judgmental. This was fine until I learned that she was also very flirtatious. She always enjoyed the company of men more than women because women intimidated her (social comparison). Her flirtation turned into texting as things devolved in our relationship. She would blow me off to hang with \"friends.\" This was a huge issue for me with her... \n\nYou see, not only did she have N attributes but she was also very avoidant in her attachment style. She never posted any pics of us. Rarely did we take snapchats together etc. She was inaffectionate and struggled with intimacy so much. Kissing in public- nope. Trusting that im not cheating on her- nope. Talking to me about her feelings- nope. Snuggling - nope. it was terrible.\n\nShe could not take responsibility for her actions. Ever. My sister, one of the closest people to me in my life, my N tried to estrange me from, by accusing her of malicious things which were obviously misrepresentations of the truth to fit her narrative.  \n\nWhen I tried to do things for myself she would get upset. If I wanted to go fishing on a weekend day she would get upset and then lure me in with sex or try and make me feel guilty for something to keep me around. The most fucked up thing for me was that I developed ED on top of everything. I have a huge sex drive. Id do it 5 times a day if my  girl had been up for it. But I was so wary of her, and felt so disconnected I literally couldn't get hard. When I sought support from her she became a victim and said it was cuz I didnt find her attractive etc. She is a beautiful woman. Literally, by any standard. It was so painful to know I couldnt go to her for support. \n\nI lost all sense of self. I ended up racking up credit card bills. I tried so often to explain that I couldn't afford to go out twice a week with her. She would still try and push me to and rarely offer to pay. Her mother got very ill since we started dating and my N started working at a job she hated. She spent three straight months either maladaptively acting out about her mother or complaining to me about work. EVERY DAY for three months at least. \n\nWhen I finally started to put up walls like, \"no I cant take you out\" or \"no I cant come over, I know youre sad and need support\" She finally started to learn. \n\n*Takeaway*\n\nI realized after she finally had the nerve to break up with me and I didn't give in to the not so subtle requests to reconnect, that she had so badly abused me over the year. My finances were destroyed. My mental health gone. No friends. Rarely saw family. But I realized also that it wasn't her fault. It wasn't her fault that I didn't respect myself more. Its not her fault that I didn't have boundaries. \n\nI loved a woman who I knew was broken. And I learned that I am broken too. She didn't break me. She showed me who I was. I am codependent. I should've never let it get so far. Does that mean I forgive her? Not yet. But I understand why she is the way that she is, so I dont resent her.\n\nSo much that people impose upon us is a reflection of their own inner demons.

I know all about trauma bonding but I don't know what I can do about it and it's really affecting me lately.  So I'm posting here in case anyone has some insight or advice.\n\n  \nI was in a polyamorous relationship with my ex narc and his husband.  I met him years ago when we were both living in another state and we were into each other right off the bat.  For years, he would get close and imply a future together, only to pull away from me.  I thought it was because he felt weird about it because of his husband, but the three of us got along great and had some wonderful times together.  I loved his husband too but we didn't have quite the same intense connection me and my narc did.  Still, we often talked about the idea of all being together, which would get me so excited, but then he would distance from me, which hurt terribly.  We all had different talents and temperaments and I really wanted us to be a family, so it was really disappointing when he would dangle that in front of me and then yank it away.  Whenever I would try to move on and date someone new, he would swoop in and sleep with my new boyfriends. So he would pull away and as soon as my attention and affection were turned towards someone else, he would insert himself into my new relationship.  He did this twice.  The last time it happened, it drove a wedge between us and we stopped talking altogether.  It was so painful to be estranged from him.  Then he and and his husband moved halfway across the country, which hurt even more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome months later, he reached out to me again saying I should come visit them and see how things might now be between us.  I did, and once again, he floated the possibility of being all together only to yank the idea out from under me.  Finally, they decided to move again to yet another state, and this time, he asked me to come live with them.  We could all start over together in a totally new state in a big new house where we could all live.  So we did and for awhile, it was amazing.  I had the family I always wanted.  We worked on rebuilding the house, got to know the city together, and just created a wonderful home.  His husband is not much into sex at all so for the first few months, my narc and I had a great sex life.  I thought we had finally gotten past all the uncertainty of the past.  I thought he invited me to live with them because he was finally ready to love me completely, and just be with me.  I was SO happy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut soon, he started growing distant from me.  It seemed like he resented me because it took me awhile to find work, and he felt like I was taking advantage of him, even though there was no advantage at all in my not working.  I was trying very hard to find a job but media jobs are scarce here and I was trying to find other kinds of work.  When I finally did find a job and was able to pay my share of things, he seemed resentful that I had a job I loved that I could do from home, so I had the house to myself all day.  Meanwhile, he had to go every day to a job that he hated, and he never had the house to himself.  (He was the one who bought it.).  I understand how that could be frustrating, but it wasn't my fault.  He stopped having sex with me and started hooking up regularly with some other guy, which really hurt me.  Whenever I'd mention that, he'd tell me I was too needy, that attraction comes and goes in relationships and he just wasn't that into me at the time.  It had only been a few months!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a very affectionate person and I like a lot of closeness, but he was never very affectionate with me, except maybe in the very beginning.  He said that just the word \"snuggle\" made him gag and he said he hoped I would find someone who could fulfill that need for me, already palming me off on other people.  He didn't like the way I touched or kissed him, and would recoil from my touch, saying that when I did it too softly it hurt his skin.  I would try to get into sex with him my kissing his body and touching him, but he'd say \"I don't really need all this foreplay and mushy stuff, let's just get to it.\"  And in a year of living together, we didn't spend a single night together.  I don't need to be draped over my partner night and day, but a night together once in awhile would have been nice.  But he always had an excuse:  \"I'm just not comfortable sleeping with other people.\"  \"I'm just used to sleeping with my husband.\"  \"Your bed's too small.\"  \"Our sleep schedules are too different.\"  I thought \"Okay, well, we're just different that way but there are other good things about our relationship, so I'll just have to get my needs met by other people.\"  But then when I would, he'd get jealous and upset.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I reacted to him spending time with this other guy while ignoring me, he would call me needy.  Which was gaslighting to me because I really started to think that maybe my needs were out of bounds, or that I was asking too much.  If I pressed the issue, he would tell me he didn't want to talk about it and if I kept pushing the matter, we couldn't have a relationship together, it was all a big mistake.  So I learned to shut up about it, which was great for him because he didn't have to hear it, but I still had to live with my feelings, and they came out in negative ways, which didn't help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis needs were to be respected and met without question, while my needs made me \"needy\".  Everything he ever asked me to do for him to feel comfortable and secure in our relationship, I did.  When he said, \"Don't ask me to be monogamous, I'm not responsible for your feelings, and I'm going to do what I want with whoever I want whenever I want\" I said okay, even though it hurt me.  When he said \"Let's be monogamous for awhile, I'm feeling jealous\" I said okay even though I felt it was a bit hypocritical of him.  When he said \"Let's be open again\" I said okay.  When he said \"I don't want you bringing guys over during the day when I'm not here\" I said okay, even though I wasn't really doing that much.  When he said \"I want to meet your other fwb's so I know who's coming in and out of my house and feel comfortable around them\", I did, even though he liked to keep his lovers all to himself.  EVERY THING he asked me to do, I did it.  But whenever I had any needs, whenever I needed something from him for me to feel comfortable and secure in our relationship, he called me needy and manipulative.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLater, I found out it wasn't that he didn't like intimacy, it was that he didn't like it WITH ME.  Because within a week of meeting this new guy earlier this year, he was telling me that he loved him, that he couldn't wait to spend the night with him and they were already planning to go on a weekend getaway together, when WE hadn't even done those things.  Then he would bring this guy over and right in front of me, they'd be touching and kissing and giggling and whispering. I had to watch him have the relationship I wanted with him with someone else.   I tried to be cool with it as long as I could, but finally, I lost it and dumped a beer on the guy's head while they were being cutesy in front of me again.  I know it was a dumb, inappropriate thing to do, but I reached my limit with this cruelty.  But it was all the excuse my narc needed to kick me out of the house.  I lost everything; my family, the only home I'd known in this strange new city, my hopes for the future, everything I picked up my whole life and moved it here for.  He didn't lose anything.  He just kept screwing around with his new guy right down the hallway from me while I cried all by myself in my room.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen he started getting really vindictive.  First he texted me while I was away in my former home state to be with friends and figure things out, saying he didn't want me back there, he didn't want me to stay there while I looked for a new place.  I had nowhere else to go.  I don't have many friends here, at least none that I could just ask to crash with for a month or two.  He was trying to kick me out into the street in the middle of winter.  If the tenancy laws weren't on my side, I'm sure he would have locked me out of the house.  He started telling our friends that he had to kick me out because I drank too much and caused problems, even though I wasn't drunk when this happened, and I'd never done anything like that before.  Then he told me he wanted back rent, even though he had told me to keep that money so I could get out of there and into my own place.  So he didn't want me to stay there, but he he didn't want me to have the money to get somewhere else either.  It's like he just wanted to see me suffer, or was trying to \"get me\" or teach me a lesson or something.  And as stupid as what I did was, I didn't do it out of vindictiveness; I did it because I was suffering and I was hurt and I'd had enough.  He had been texting and emailing me all this shit and when I finally confronted him about it in person (calmly, no shouting), he got so angry that I called him out on his behavior that he cussed at me and then started puking in the bathroom.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI eventually left and got into a nice place of my own in a nicer part of town.  I finally got a good job that pays well.  I have some new friends who have really been there for me during this whole thing.  Things are getting better, but I still miss him and his husband so much.  I miss our house, I miss watching movies on the couch together, I miss gardening together, I miss going on day trips together.  A lot of our relationship was wonderful.  He would open up to me sometimes even though it was hard for him.  He often told me how happy and glad he was that I was there with them.  He would put his arm around me as we stood on our back porch in the evening and say \"We're really doing this.\"  I miss the family we had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have not spoken to either of them since this went down but I know that he was fired from his job and is now on unemployment for something he's ashamed to tell anyone about.  His new guy keeps breaking up with him because he doesn't give him enough attention.  He's regretting buying that shithole of a house.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm trying to move on, but I am so tempted to reach out to him, not necessarily to get back together or move back in (the place is a dump), but just to get some closure or to salvage the good parts of our relationship, because there was a lot of good there.  I don't want to have wasted these last 7 years together.  But then I think, after all the things he's done to hurt me, why do I want him back in my life?  All my closest friends and relatives have been telling me for years to forget about him.  None of them thought it was a good idea for me to move here with him.  And I kind of know all this, but I just can't help thinking that he MUST feel SOMETHING for me.  Why ask me to move here and start a life with him?  Why keep coming back to me over all these years?  He's quite attractive and talented, and so many other guys have fallen in love with him over the years, but he never gravitated back towards them again and again like he has with me.  Sometimes it seems like he is jealous of me somehow.  Jealous that I don't have the responsibility of a house and marriage like he does, jealous that I'm in touch with my emotions and he has a hard time expressing them, jealous that I don't hate my job, jealous that I could leave any time I want to and he's stuck where he is.  Maybe he's at once drawn to me yet repelled by me.  I don't know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry for the long post, I just don't know what else to do.  I miss him every single day, and I often cry just thinking about the whole situation.  I have no plans to reach out to them any time soon; I need to feel better about myself first, make some money at my new job and wait for my broken foot to heal.  Maybe once that happens, I won't feel so much like contacting them or I'll feel strong enough to face them without breaking down.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

So I\u2019ll start with the basics, during my early teenage years up until I was seventeen my dad would sexually abuse me from time to time. It all started one day when I was in the 7th grade, my dad asked if I was curious about boys and said that my mom was very strict when it came to having the \u201cbirds and bees\u201d talk so I could ask him anything at all. I didn\u2019t want to until a year later when I was in a relationship. Some of my friends were already having sex at this age (before we even started high school). I told my dad I thought about having sex with my boyfriend and he gave me condoms. I was young and naive, I thought that would be the end of any sexual discussions. Well, one night we went for a walk and he stopped me and just stuck his hand down my pants. Prior to this, there were no signs of him ever indicating that he was attracted to me or children on looking back. He made up excuses that he had to \u201cexamine\u201d me to make sure everything was \u201cnormal\u201d down there since I wanted to be sexually active. He would stop for a few months then do it again and again with each time getting worse. The very last time this happened, my mom was out of town with her friends and he actually tried to drug me and have intercourse with me but I fought back. The very next day I had a female family member pick me up and spent the entire weekend with her. I eventually opened up and told her what my dad had been doing and she immediately called my mom. My mom rushed home and we called the cops on him to file a police report. Fast forward to a couple years later, he\u2019s finally serving time but a short sentence pleading guilty to only one of the charges.\n\nNow after going what I went through, remembering bits and pieces of times it happened and how he manipulated me, I can\u2019t believe that sometimes I still worry about him. Maybe \u201cworry\u201d isn\u2019t the correct word but more so curious to know how and where he\u2019s living, if he is miserable, if he\u2019s working, and what he looks like now. I go onto the Megan\u2019s Law website and search for him to make sure he\u2019s far away from me. From what I can see now, he is \u201cTransient\u201d. I know he is suffering and paying the price for all the pain he has caused our family and most of all, myself. I wonder if he thinks about ending his own life to put himself out of his misery. Sometimes I want to go watch him from afar to see it for myself but in actuality, I would never go anywhere near him. I would never want him to find me.\n\nI really don\u2019t understand any of my emotions or these thoughts I\u2019ve been having over the years. It\u2019s been about 11 years since this all unraveled and everything happened. Up until the last couple of days when I searched for him online, I have just been dwelling on these bits and pieces kind of regressing all of the healing I\u2019ve done. I am in pain, I have so much anxiety, and I feel confused. I don\u2019t really know if I ever got my closure. I just have this feeling of uneasiness and wondering why all of a sudden I keep thinking of him and all that he did to me to ruin my family.\n\nIf you read this, thank you for reading.

You gave your very best, you gave love when you had none for yourself. You were understanding and thoughtful. You changed who you were to better accommodate them. \n\nChances are you were very vulnerable when you met...that deep wound was already there. They soothed the hurt and made you feel better. You get comfortable, they withdraw, wound exposed, they soothe..withdraw, it goes on and on. Its a very painful cycle, it feels very similar to drug addiction. Yay...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.) You were RELEASED.\n\n I always hated reading articles where they say \"It's not personal, them discarding you has nothing to do with who YOU are\" - Yeah ok- I bet if I looked like that hot yoga instructor on youtube...then he/she would have never left me like a piece of trash....yeah they still would have. They are incapable of loving...they like receiving. End of story. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Abuse is not acceptable\n\nYou are not responsible for his/her behavior. A lot of times people who abuse were abused themselves. It's tragic. I'm sure you've heard all the sad stories from their childhood. Its is VERY sad. You have to remember though,  no matter what abuse they suffered, they do not get to abuse you. THEY are still responsible for how they act. It's that simple.\n\nYou are responsible for your decisions and actions. You have the power and right to say - No.. Not one more second with you.\n\nWe are human, we all make mistakes,  we have less than good behavior at times, that's part of being human.\n\nIf the behavior/ mistake is abusive its unacceptable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.) Own them feelings. \n\nFor me I was sad when it ended, but I was also angry. \n\nEvery time I was disrespected in the relationship, I was angry but I had to shove it deep down, deny it. I had to act like it was ok because I didn't want to start a fight. But now that I was free from the relationship I could own my feelings. Anger is just as important of an emotion as happiness. The moment when you start feeling angry about all the abuse you endured...you are fighting for yourself. The feelings pass, you wont stay angry forever, even though it can seem like that.  You are going to grieve and that's ok. Release the anger, the sadness all those emotions bottled up from months or years. \n\nFeelings come and go, you cant control them. I'm sure everyone would like to be happy all the time but it's not how it works. If you feel sad..feel it! Cry your heart out.  Acknowledge it...set it free.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou will overcome this.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I am young, and don't have the option to leave my home (hoping to get a permit when I am 15 to leave and get a job.) Me and my father do not get along very well. I'm told it's because of my OCD and his anger issues. Recently we are on vacation with me, him, and his wife/my stepmother among our other family members. We recently have been getting along worse, and Im not sure how to handle it. Here's a recent example of what I'm talking about. Currently, where I am it is 79 degrees, with humidity. I am sleeping in a truck with the windows up (I'm not sure why) the best way to describe the feeling of being in here is being under a blanket with no opening for hours on end. I had to get out for a few moments because I felt cramped and nauseous. He and my stepmother we're going and going to bed or getting ready for bed, not sure they were in the tent. My dad came out and asked what I was doing. I explained it how I explained it here. He argued saying things like 'are we going to have an issue here?' and 'im going to put you in residential care this is the last time I'm dealing with you.' finally my stepmother came and put her elbow (or stomach, not sure) behind the folding chair and was actively trying to dump me out of folding chair. I sat in a way my arm was holding the back part of chair and my feet were keeping the chair from tipping over while talking to my dad. While that was happening I moved my arm accidentally pushing on her arm or stomach. She said shedidn't want me touching her  as she folded the chair while pushing my back down and tipping chair. I fell down and stood up as she said she was sick and tired of this shit and how I needed to go because I'm a fucking gremlin. My dad told her to shut up and they started arguing as I sat up finally they stopped arguing and my stepmother said she was leaving and left for a walk. Me and my dad left for a walk while he was saying stuff like 'my life doesn't matter' and 'i deal with fucking crazies all day' (I'm trying to make this faster sorry) so my stepmother came back and my dad forced me into the back of the truck and told me if I left he would use violence. So I sat in there and waited. He came in and sat next to me and said that he was going to stay in here. I told him it was a small truck and he was adding to the heat and his response was shut up before I make you. I satrted crying after a bit and he started counting down from 3 and I couldn't stop cryingm. Finially after he got to 1 he grabbed my next and bent my wrists so I was bear hunting myself and couldn't move. He forced me to the bottom of the truck and told me to shut the fuck up. I couldn't breathe cause I was being held and started to get (claustrophobic??) And started crying that only made it worse. Finially he let go and told me what was going to happen. Either my stepmom was leaving tonight, we were all leaving then he'd make my life as bad as he could make it (to quote( or he was going to position the truck in between the tree and car in a way I couldn't get out until he felt like I learned my lesson. I have been scared because I don't know what's going to happen my stepmother just left and my grandmother came down to check how everything is and now my dads whisper yelling at her. Other examples are when my dad has locked me in my room cause he can't deal with me and he messed with my OCD and calls me crazy. We can't have a conversation without him telling me that it's ok I'm stupid and I can't help it. When I say I'm not stupid he says 'oh see your issues are a lie.' so then I have to say no your right sorry. He's said he won't leave a mark because he knows vetter. I'm not sure if this is abuse because of the lack of mark? Nobody believes me because he just says I'm crazy. How do I bide my time?? Q", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I always know that he is really picky and wants perfection all the time, and he really likes arguing with people on FB about politics. Before when we were fighting or arguing because I was upset with him, I was impulsive and said something bad to him, then almost 95% of fight ended up me apologizing to him for what I said, but the main reason why i was upset with him was always ignored.\n\nAs time passed by, I love him more and more, I saw therapist and talked with my bf\u2019s parents for help, I manage to think more rationally during fights and control what I say more carefully. Then I realize that my bf is difficult for me to tolerate. \n\nCase 1: when he said something that I feel improper and hurtful or mean, i asked him to stop saying that and told him how I feel. He replied to me that he has the right to say whatever he wants and it\u2019s unbelievable how controlling I am to tell him what to say, what not to say. While when he asked me not to say whatever I want to say, if I insist my opinion, he will call me abusive and don\u2019t care about his feeling.\n\nCase 2: he told me to be infinite patient to him, never feel frustrated or irritated about him under any situation and I have to ask my therapist how to cope with him better. While last weekend, we tried to play Portal 2 together and I have no experience about the game, so I got confused about my feeling of what I see and what I expect. I told him at least three times what I\u2019m confused about, he tried to explain the rule for me, but I was sure that I know the rule, so I kept asking why, he then replied to me that there is no problem, you won\u2019t listen to what I say and you are so close minded and arrogant. You are such an impossible person. I spent several hours to comfort him and begged him. I have given my max patience but he is less and less patient to me. Before I blamed myself of not being patient, so my bf treated me impatient, but now I think I have tried my best, he is still being mean and impatient to me.\n\nCase 3: Before when I was angry, i yelled sometimes and followed his sentence closely to argue. He would ghost me immediately when that happened and I have to apologize so much for what I did. While he yelled at me, swore to me and interrupted me, he said it was me who made him so angry and he had to yell, swear and interrupt me. He promised me not to do that, but most of the time, he said that I deserve to be yelled, swore and interrupted. \n\nCase 4: there are a lot of times that I can\u2019t tolerate to obey all his rules and give up what I like, so I want to leave his control. I tried to break up with him after failing to talk to him. The reason is because he got upset with me whenever I\u2019m upset with the situation where I have to compromise to give him what he wants. He started to give me something that I don\u2019t need to compensate and if I don\u2019t accept it, he will give up on me and accuse me of wasting his love and taking everything for granted. After several years of unfair treatment, I\u2019m really at the situation that I don\u2019t know how to make both of us happy. He never changes or doubts himself, while he claimed that I\u2019m the one who is arrogant. When I told him that I want to break up, he would still accuse me of making drama and not dealing with my emotion well. So I have to change and apologize. But he would abandon me or change to another cruel and cold blooded person immediately when he feels like that I\u2019m blaming him of anything. He said that he doesn\u2019t want to marry me or we shouldn\u2019t get married at least three times after he proposed to me and told me seriously that I can\u2019t break up with him after proposal. \n\nI\u2019m really confused what is going on and for most of recent fights, I feel like it stronger and stronger that my bf is treating me unfairly and always turns everything around on me to make him the center of our world. He calls me names, accuse me of being controlling, manipulative, abusive whenever he is angry with me, whiling laughing at me when I\u2019m crying and being sarcastic when I am in trouble. I love him but I doubt who he really is and whether he loves me or not, or why he loves me. Before I felt guilty about myself each time after fighting, he never thinks he did anything wrong in any fights. But now I try really hard to control what I said and be rational, I argue with him with logic, he becomes less patient and treats me worse. I\u2019m in such a big pain to be hopeless that our relationship won\u2019t work no matter how much I want to do for him. I hate to say that if you change a little, maybe everything will start to work, because I\u2019m afraid of more scold or blame from him by saying that to him. \n\nNow he asks me to be calm, loving, sweet no matter what happens and I have to apologize for all fights. Besides, I have to think of what kind of person I am and find ways to cope with him. I\u2019m so desperate now and I am so confused. Am i so abusive, manipulative and controlling to him that I deserve to be treated like this? What have I done so far? I\u2019m just being unhappy in this relationship and I tried to talk to him, but all those is forbidden now.

It was my first relationship and it was all long distance, so it was mainly him getting through me by words. It wasn\u2019t hard honestly. He told me countless lies about his life to make me feel bad for him. A bit of venting was fine but this amount was not okay. It was just his way of making me stay put and keep me by his side. I\u2019ve always been an empathetic person at heart, and back then I didn\u2019t really have anybody else but him. So I didn\u2019t want to lose him. I still have screenshots of his worst moments. And his life story which is now laughable.\n\nHe also loved to send me love bombs now and then, telling me how thankful he was and how important I was to him. The bombs were often texts that lasted paragraphs. Sometimes I felt obligated to do the same because I felt bad. He even asked me what it was like \u201cbeing perfect\u201d once, despite still boasting about being this ultra smart intellectual.\n\nIf he wasn\u2019t praising me he was being pretty scummy too, I think he was a bit of a Nazi sympathizer after trying to explain that Hitler \u201cwasn\u2019t racist against Jews\u201d and in general \u201cwasn\u2019t racist\u201d. I wish I had said something. But I was still so terrified to make him upset that I kept my mouth shut.\n\nBut then he suddenly ghosted me out of nowhere. In that point of time I managed to move on the best I could and made friends I\u2019m thankful to still have. This lasted a few months before he came back with a new account. He said his tablet broke. I reluctantly came back after a PM request from him crying over me not noticing his PM on Christmas Day. I made sure to reduce our bond to just being friends. His grasp weakened over a few months, and soon enough he wasn\u2019t bothering me anymore. I was free.\n\nFinally not having to coddle anyone, my group of friends managed to be there for me and help me grow as a person, and I\u2019ve been friends with them for a few years now. One of those friends was the next person I would be in a relationship with. It was WLW, and everything was pretty different. My new girlfriend was pretty great. While I was quieter and introverted, she was a spontaneous hothead with a loyal loving heart. She vented a few times but knew my past and was careful with me. Our contrast really helped us build off eachother. She helped me gain confidence and I helped her know when to slow down and care for others.\n\nShe and I eventually went back to friend territory after we noticed our lives were going two different paths and furthering things would be difficult. But I\u2019m thankful to finally have a taste of something healthy. I\u2019m working on myself now. I\u2019ve even lost 28 pounds and cleared my skin up some since I went back to being single again. The last time I checked His profile, the most recent post was that of last December. Crying and wailing about being ill and the want to just feel better. Good to know I didn\u2019t miss much.

I just believed that he loved me...\n\nHe would also constantly talk to me about many of the shorcomings he percieved my mom had and sometimes the things he said hinted to a strong dislike toward her. \n\nWas what he did wrong?\n\nI got nightmares of him touching me after he left. Like standing behind me while I was infront of the mirror. He was looking at my body with a lewd smirk on his face as he ran his hands over me.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I understood that the relationship wasn\u2019t functional, and ended it, but I\u2019m hesitant to call it abuse, even though some of my family/friends have said they believed it was. Here are a few reasons why I chose to end the relationship:\n\n1. My ex was very paranoid that I would cheat on him. He insisted on being signed into my social media accounts and discouraged me from having or talking to male friends.\n\n2. He constantly accused me of cheating on him. I would never ever have cheated on him.\n\n3. If I didn\u2019t answer his texts quickly enough, he would get angry. He would call the house phone, or literally just show up at my house and be all mad at me for \u201cignoring him.\u201d \n\n4. Sometimes I felt like my boundaries were being ignored. When I asked for some personal time or time to spend with my other friends or family he would become personally offended or would just show up at my house anyway even when I had asked for space. When I had a busy school/work schedule one semester and told him I may only be able to spend quality time/go on dates with him once or twice a week he became angry with me, even though I had little control over my schedule. I also felt pressured for sex on numerous occasions, and felt guilty for not complying even if I wasn\u2019t in the mood. \n\n5. Sometimes I felt like he would go back on his word. He would promise me something and then later refuse to fulfill the promise.\n\nHowever, even though all these things were troubling to me, there were many ways in which he was wonderful to me. He would go out of his way to surprise me, was (for the most part) always kind to my family and friends, and after a hard day he always seemed to know what to say to make me feel better. There were some very happy times in the relationship, which is why I\u2019m hesitant to say he was abusive. Does this sound like abuse? Or was I just overreacting when I felt disappointed in the relationship?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

In between visits with him he would give me the silent treatment. He was withholding affection even more than before. I didn\u2019t hear from him for a week after July 4th. He was partying the whole day never looked at my messages  until the next day and never responded. I finally messaged him Thursday night and he didn\u2019t look at it until Friday. Read and never responded. Did the same with all my other text messages.\n\nI feel like I deserved at least five minutes face to face for him to explain himself so I went to his apartment. He was on speakerphone with his best friend. She is a drug dealer and the one who got him back on coke and also half his age. I knocked and he didn\u2019t answer and did not speak to me but loudly and passive aggressively talked to me through her. He was so cruel. He told me to \u201cgo away\u201d and said \u201cbye!\u201d in a really childish tone. I admit I lost it and began begging him to open the door so I could talk to him for just five minutes. He ended it by saying he would call the cops if I didn\u2019t leave. He was acting the victim and his best friend was being all sympathetic. \n\nI don\u2019t react well to being ignored. I was just ghosted by the father of my baby and person I\u2019d been involved with for the past year. I tried to get him to talk to me but he didn\u2019t for days. I let him have it over text saying he was a narc and all I ever was to him was his supply. That he uses people and has been using people for a long time. He was saying on the phone that he\u2019s tired of dealing with me. He has borderline tendencies as well and is extremely volatile and would break up with me over the slightest thing or give me the silent treatment. I told him I\u2019ve been dealing with him from day one.\n\nHe didn\u2019t respond until I said I would need to file child support. I even told him I\u2019d go for the minimum if I could. He came back right away saying he was going to take me to court for custody and have his friends act as witnesses to say I am crazy and an unfit mother. He never wanted the baby. He told me to \u201cget rid of it\u201d when I told him. He changed his mind but it was only because he heard voices and had a delusion his future daughter was saying \u201cno daddy don\u2019t kill me.\u201d He told me when we met he\u2019s heard voices his whole life. I don\u2019t know what to do. I just signed a lease on my own. All my money will go to bills. I can\u2019t afford a lawyer. I DON\u2019T want him ever around his friends. EVER. I don\u2019t care if he has visitation but do not want him to have unsupervised visits because he is a cokehead. I know it is out of your system quickly. I don\u2019t know what to do now. I just want to raise my son. But now he\u2019s making threats. I\u2019m tired of him being so blind he doesn\u2019t even see what he is doing is wrong and being labeled crazy when he\u2019s been mentally unstable several times during our relationship.

They had no concern about me as a child. I would wash and iron my own clothes. Try to study, get to school on time, etc.\n\nOne of my uncles dropped me at school and he was always late so I remember feeling very tense during that time. If I was late I would get called out. Teachers would ask the whole class what is the difficulty in studying when your parents take care of everything... According to them we didn't have to cook or clean. I would be sitting there thinking with some pain in my heart that I do have to.\n\nI would try to sleep during school days and they would wake up at midnight and start talking loudly. I was in the room next door and found it disturbing. I started to get annoyed at the way my aunt and grandma were treating me.\n\nWhen I retaliated they did the same with double the force. Suddenly I was the problem. I was a horrible person, just because I wouldn't give them money for whatever they wanted it for. I had a little cousin who never lets me be but since he was my aunts I couldn't say anything. If he cried I automatically did something to him.\n\nI developed an eating disorder and became scarily thin. I had difficulty walking for prolonged periods of time because I was so weak. I felt like I had belly fat so that would sustain me. Besides I didn't eat much of whatever they gave me. Once I cooked fish, and I ate some of it. My aunt asked me where it went and when I told her that I'd eaten it her demeanor changed. I made sure never to eat too much or ask for seconds unless offered after that.\n\nAfter school ended I was buying groceries, cooking, cleaning and looking after my little cousin, all the while my aunt just pretends to have a certain illness. She does have asthma but she goes too far with it sometimes.\n\nI remember sitting there with them while they were talking about things. I didn't want to listen to them anymore so I would just look out the door and suddenly I didn't hear them anymore. I would just be in a dream like state.\n\n I was very into eacapism during that time. Any form of music, masturbation, books and stories took me in and out of reality. Anything to get away really because physically I was stuck in that place.\n\nAs I started college I had difficulty being grounded in reality. I had a hard time focusing as a result of what I used to cope with what had happened previously. It took me about six months to be able to study anything properly because it was difficult for me to focus my attention on anything.\n\nI grew up a lot during that year.

The whole 9 yards.\n\nThen one day we were talking and he mentioned that his friend and his girlfriend were going through a really rough patch.

Said friend was pissed the fuck off that my SO had told me about their struggles and pretty much stopped talking to him after my text. After 3-4 weeks my SO asked him what the hell was going on and he told him about the text I had sent. \n\nWhen I came home from work that day, he didn\u2019t even give me time to close the front door when he snarled at me \u201cDID YOU TEXT [FRIEND]?\u201d Now mind you, nearly a month had passed after the text and I was so baffled by his seething rage I said \u201cWhat? No?\u201d and he said \u201cSHOW ME YOUR PHONE\u201d. I scrolled back and found my text and I told him that yes, I texted him when they were having a rough time. \u201cWHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING TEXTING MY FRIEND BEHIND MY BACK?!? WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?? DID YOU REALLY THINK HE\u2019D APPRECIATE A TEXT LIKE THAT? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOU DID?!?\u201d By now I was crying because he was screaming at me and his eyes were shooting fire. \u201cIF I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MY BEST FRIEND AND A CRUSH DO YOU REALLY THINK I\u2019D _EVER_ CHOOSE YOU OVER HIM?!

Then he apologised for getting so angry at me but \u201che really thought he had lost his friend\u201d and we made up.\n\nThat was it. The first time. We made up, but that was the first time I got the taste of an argument feeling unresolved after it ended. I was so blind, so unaware. We didn\u2019t fight often, but when we did, he tore me to ab.so.lute shreds. And I let him.

You\u2019re a horrible, evil, manipulative &amp; cruel person. I deeply cared for and loved you at one time more than I did myself. I would have done anything for you, and you knew it.\n\nIll never be able to fully comprehend what went on in your head; You went from posting about how happy you were and your Irish family to me being the worst person in the world in the space of 24 hours me not knowing what I had done. How you handled the whole situation was like an evil spoiled brat. You never once tried to talk about the relationship and why you supposedly weren\u2019t happy which was all my fault. Firstly, you projected your faults in the relationship onto me casting me as you. This still wasn\u2019t enough although you always knew what you were doing and your next steps in the forms of what relationship you would go onto nest. You had to keep me around in my misery to watch like a sadistic voyeur getting pleasure from watching the pain you were inflicting. It made you feel powerful, you revelled in it getting drunk off the misery and just shows who you are. When you got me to fake a conversation so that you could send it to your new lover to convince him I was just a friend I refused to do so until you happily lied about your fear for your kids safety unless I did this knowing that I would cave. Your exact words you would never live with yourself if anything happened to the girls you knew the script, and once I had served my purpose I was cut off again and thrown out in the cold, left with both the shame and the grief. You posted you\u2019re next 2 boyfriends on FB in the space of a month of us breaking up a teenager would have had more respect let alone a grown woman.\n\nWhen I said you may not be your Stepfathers blood but you certainly were his daughter was never a truer statement. He trained you and so did your mum and you became a hybrid version of their worst traits with a pretty face thrown on it to deceive the world. I don\u2019t if you were ever real there were so many lies that I knew were complete BS. You would lie even though I knew you were lying even when there were clear lies and I would say I don\u2019t care that it\u2019s a lie you would deny it to the ground still just cos you have to control the narrative. You\u2019re incapable of truth.\n\nMy biggest regret is wasting my love on you.\n\nI should of known when you went into refuge you clearly had never ended things with your husband even though you should me pictures of the letter you wrote him etc. I knew deep down why would of it all kicked off if the relationship had been over with him! I should of told you to fck off but I didn\u2019t want to let you go. I am glad I didn\u2019t tell you to fck off, not because I got to spend a few months with you but as that\u2019s the kind of loving trusting person I am and I will never changed that or let you take that away from me. I embraced your children with as much love as I would for my own family from the moment I met them outside that church in Crowborough although I always knew I was at risk of having that relationship snapped away from me as there was a high likelihood you would return to old patterns. It also shows how little you actually care about those girls. They are pawns to you and exactly what your step father thought of you, they are status symbols, objects to be controlled and used. You had just left their father taken them out of their school and home and brought them to a Refuge! Even though there was no need to. You did this to gain an advantage on your husband and also cos you wanted to go away for the weekend and Fuck and feel excitement for yourself you were never scared. Then you kissed a man (me) in front of them and spent a weekend in a hotel room with him.\n\nYou pushed and pushed to get your daughters to speak to my nieces, I am just glad I never let my blind love for you surpass my love for my nieces no how matter much you pushed I never allowed it cos I knew deep down you could just turn around and cut everyone off when you felt like it. I didn\u2019t want my nieces to be in a position where they could be hurt by you.\n\nYou\u2019re a fa\u00e7ade a sham of a person. Nothing you say has any value or weight to it.\n\nYou blame your problems on your \u201cIllness\u201d because you\u2019re lazy and unwilling to actually work on yourself, you have a personality disorder not a Mental Illness.\n\nThere is so much I could say and go into but I wont, even why I felt compelled to write this is not for your benefit, its because when you ended things you gave me no closure purposely, you took the cowards way out. You wouldn\u2019t face or speak to me. Just gave me a long text out of nowhere. You were incapable of having a grown up conversation so reverted to your childish shitty self. You treated me like the dirt off your shoe and as if I was a stranger harassing you.\n\nYou sent me a video of you telling the girls I had gone to Africa to help the children as if I was supposed to happy that you gave me a nice disappearance story. Then you introduce them to your new lover and then again all in the space of a month all while in the heat of an intense custody battle . Your actions speak louder than your words ever will or than I can say. As I said at the start of this I don\u2019t care if you read this or not but I wanted to say my piece that you never allowed me to speak cos it might mean you\u2019d actually have to face your actions and acknowledge what you did.\n\nIll finish this letter with this; when you were getting me to lie to your new lover was the only time you were ever honest with me.\n\nYou said: \u201cYou were a Cunt, an evil bitch, stupid an idiot, that you had everything you ever wanted and still weren\u2019t happy. You\u2019ll never be happy and that is truly sad, you are incapable of happiness cos you\u2019re too lazy to work on yourself and too arrogant that you think you don\u2019t need to and everyone else does.\n\nI am not angry anymore. I bear no feelings of hate or love for you. You are just a memory, a time in my life when I was looking for something that really didn\u2019t exist. The person I loved was the one I created in my mind which was far from the reality of what you actually were (Polar opposites).\n\nThis is the last thing I will ever write to you as in my concisous you do not exist, and you never really did.\n\nGoodbye forever.\n\nRegards,\n\nMr. Strongerwithoutyou", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Everything fell into place, it was perfect. I pretty much just had the threadbare clothes on my back and he gave me a job in a field I had no experience in, a starting bonus, premium parts for a PC, hotel dinners etc. He was ecstatic to have me (his new best friend) back in his life. At one point he invited me to be the best man at his wedding that ultimately never came to be.\n\nInitially I was under no illusion as to why he was \"love bombing\". He was in really bad shape... In the previous year his fianc\u00e9e lost both parents to illness, had 2 miscarriages, she was fighting aggressive pancreatic cancer, her sister was later diagnosed with local recurrence of breast cancer (from which she would not recover the second time around). Her abusive ex-bf was still in the picture threatening to find them and they lived in fear of his retribution for her leaving him. This all while he lived alone with no friends or family to support in a foreign country where he couldn't speak the language. I could not have felt more pity for someone.\n\nMy Narc is very charming when he needs to be, tall, traditionally handsome to some, young and successful (Managing director in his 20's). Drives a v8 which he calls his 'panty dropper' or some variation and lives in a very central apartment by the water of the countries capital. A lot of which he enjoys on company expenses whilst pulling in MD money. On paper, the guy has it made. Despite this though, he has no social life outside work.\n\nHe started acting out from the first day progressing on to trashing hotel rooms, spitting on the windows, throwing food on the floor, getting drunk (sometimes driving) and starting fights in hotel bars. He hated everyone and everything including his own staff unless he was drunk or high which meant he either revelled or reviled in his behaviour depending on his mindset at the time. Eventually he would get comfortable with berating me privately first then publicly and in front of staff, I was stupid, clumsy, lazy anything that he could link to any situation and I took it all on the chin, any retaliation from me would just exacerbate the situation ten fold. If I defended myself or \"joked\" along in kind I was pulled aside and warned about disrespecting him at work. Things were frequently spun to make my fault or my problem even if it was trivial. He would throw a tantrum if there wasn't a clean desk ready for him when he got into the office, despite him not having a dedicated space due to his erratically low attendance.\n\nI was always of the mindset that it was a phase, he will get better. After all, we went way back and he needed help which was my primary driver for staying for so long. Over time it became normality. Broaching the subject always transformed into an attack, I am too sensitive, it's just a joke or I'm simply wrong. Or all three. He used to enjoy belittling me in front of service staff, my less than perfect etiquette being brought into question playfully at every opportunity while he laid on the charm thicker than a bowl of oatmeal. The routine quickly became stale and embarrassing to witness.\n\nAfter 3 years of working under him things never improved, things only gradually became worse.He would sporadically contact me to drop everything at work and take a train for 2 hours to come hang out at the company property. I was instructed specifically not to go home but to just buy what I needed along the way such as clothes and toiletries whilst at the stations. It was a sure thing that I would have to make my bed when I got there and on a couple of occasions I slept on the floor. This caused me significant issues with my work, how could I explain? Especially as he forbid me to discuss his personal issues. My colleagues hated me, they thought I was taking the company for a ride and using my friendship to neglect my responsibilities when I was in an impossible situation of pleasing my Narc vs actually doing my job.\n\nHis behaviour spiralled out of control. He would get high in clubs and prey on his staff, I know of 5 that he successfully bedded and more that he tried (His Fianc\u00e9e at the time was also previously on his staff). These are people that he would tell me are ugly and stupid in one breath only to attempt and coerce them into the sheets with the next. Much to my regret I went along with his tirades to try and placate him and not to draw more ire. He would occasionally visit strip clubs and to a lesser extent prostitutes on nights out and blow 1,000's on champagne and dances so everyone knew he was a big deal and cover it up in creative accounting. I would wait there in the club while he went into a private room or outside the brothel as I have zero interest in these things. In the aftermath he would go into hiding from shame, not showing up to work for days after, whilst recovering from the memories of his behaviour. Sometimes showing hours late for client meetings if at all. The client would always come to me asking for him when he didn't show and I lied repeatedly knowing full well he was in a hotel room 10 mins away wallowing in his hangover. I bailed on hanging out with him once towards the end of this whole experience. His reaction when I wasn't going to meet him? Messages saying that he is having heart problems, how he tried to call an ambulance but they didn't speak English and he just gave up. Examples like this are too many to count.\n\nHe treats his staff like garbage, if they have the gall to ask for a raise then they are branded as unappreciative leeches who should take better care of their money and be glad that by his grace they have a job at all although his closest competitor pays double. Bizarrely he gets angry that his staff do not want to socialise with him and is visibly disappointed when he doesn't receive fanfare on arrival at the different locations. Meanwhile he has boasted to me about how much money he has saved in his personal accounts whilst still living the high life on the company dollar. He once had the company owner buy him new tyres for his car because he didn't want to pay the 800 out of his own pocket. The hypocrisy is beyond disgusting.\n\nHe proclaims he is proud to not have attended University, again hypocritical in that he has tried since to begin studying but never committed. The truth of it is he's never been successful in academia which in itself is fine especially given his professional success except he hates on everyone else that has an education. He hates poor people although he was never affluent growing up. If someone has an issue it's not relevant, he has or has had it worse...\n\nYou may have noticed this going on whilst he is engaged, I didn't know what to think. She was dying in hospital, he couldn't visit due to her low immune system and chemo. In the years that I worked for him and frequented his home I never met, saw or spoke to her once. The only evidence of her existence was a pile of clothes and a picture by the TV. I advised him if this is the way he wants to go then he should work out some kind of arrangement with her but given the circumstances I didn't want to judge. He was incredibly sensitive about the topic. Even asking if she was making any progress required walking on eggshells. I began to doubt if she was even real... To this day I have no idea what actually happened to her.\n\nA few instances occurred which nearly broke me, we had a miscommunication over dinner where he left me at the table with no way to get home so I slept outside the warehouse waiting for the next day of work. To this day I have no idea what I did wrong but his parting paraphrased words were \"*One of us needs the other a lot more than the other needs them*\" I was devastated. He would sometimes refuse to book a hotel room for me insisting I stay with him to save the company money. On one occasion he got high on ecstasy at a staff dinner and was more interested in chasing a head of department. I gave up asking to go home at 3am and waited in the station until I could catch the first international train home. . The final straw was when I was socialising with a group of managers outside after work and he told me to \"stay\" like I was his dog, they all looked at me in shock and I knew if I had an ounce of self respect I couldn't stay any longer. There were a handful of occasions throughout the years when I would dissolve into a mess. A pathetic, crying, hopeless husk curled into a ball in the shower thinking what I did to deserve this. It was time to go.\n\nI was freelance the whole time, the company didn't offer contracts in my region for reasons unknown but I'm confident it was because the company didn't want to pay pension, vacations and sick leave etc. Because I was freelance I was under no obligation to offer a notice period when leaving for another job. I gave him a week out of courtesy which is more than they gave people who were not performing or had issues. They would simply go dark, stop asking them to come to work, not tell them why and not reply to any correspondence.\n\nAfter leaving the company I changed my number, blocked any links I had online and went no contact instantly. It took over 6 months to get over it but still to this day, every time I see his model of car I have a small heart attack. However I had one small final act of defiance in my pocket. One of the company clients had invited me to their annual party and I graciously accepted although I was no longer in their employment. I had and still have friends in that company and they were informing me that I was banned from the event. Fitting seeing as it's not Narcs party and he's telling me by proxy he forbids it and would be ejected from the venue if I tried.\n\nI know it's all bark and no bite and, with overwhelming anxiety, I attended the party in a new outfit bought for the occasion.\n\nAdequately showcasing his authority he didn't acknowledge me for the entirety of the event, after he had enough to drink he mustered up the courage to approach me once at the end of the evening asking why I went off the grid. This was my chance to tell him everything I wanted to say however I completely fluffed it under the pressure. Several staff members all over Europe were begging me to do this dirty task, to tell him what a deplorable human being he is. I managed to stutter something about the contracts not managing to make my point. He started shouting, I walked away and he went nuclear... Throwing glasses of drinks to the floor, verbally threatening to kill me in front of the few staff and client remaining. I can fight, I've trained for years and this guy most definitely can't so I wasn't concerned but I don't like to fight and doesn't make it any less unpleasant. His head manager \"held him back\" and stuffed him into a taxi.\n\nI was told the next week he showed up to work with a huge black eye, all those not in attendance or left earlier naturally assumed I did it and unashamedly I revelled in my non-achievement. He didn't help his case, telling staff in one country he had an accident with a coffee machine, another country he tripped over a bicycle. My favourite theory is he went into the city raging from the confrontation, started some trouble and finally got the recompense he deserves.\n\nI have never before met someone whose ego was so fragile. He comes from a good honest family from what I can tell. Modest, humble upbringing in white suburbia. His overwhelming need to be \\*seen\\* as successful is so confusing given his actual success. He absolutely must arrive with a fresh \u20ac50 haircut when he visits different locations. Photos and videos are banned at company events solely so he can behave like an absolute asshole, there will be no evidence and he can sleaze his way out through more lies and manipulation. If you do not fear or respect him he does not believe you deserve to live.\n\nTo this day over a year after my departure if he gets wind of my name he still becomes instantly aggressive, telling his staff they are to cut all contact with me because of my potential interference with the company. The level of paranoia is insane. He once had a PI follow and take pictures of an unofficial staff party to ensure they weren't stealing his clients. The truth is I could not care less about his business, during my time there I never did anything to damage, sabotage or take advantage and any suggestion that I would is absurd as I have nothing to gain. It pains me to know he is projecting this behaviour onto others, some of whom remain good friends and I try and be there for them but it makes it impossible to finally let go.\n\nIt took quite some time to come to the conclusion that he was a text book Narc, especially as you are constantly doubting if the problem really is you and not them after years of being told so.\n\nBe careful who you care for. Hope this helps someone out there recognise the behaviour and realise this isn't their fault.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Apperently back when we were visiting my mom and grandpa told my dad to clean up a pecan tree. My grandpa can sound a bit harsh but he's not that bad. Not like my own dad at least. Anyway, somehow my dad got offended by how my grandpa talked to him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this morning and he just snaps. He starts off saying how my grandpa's a bag of shit and stuff like that. Eventually though he starts threatening to leave my mom until my grandpa apologizes. He's screaming at the top of his lungs already. All the sudden he's saying he'll force my grandpa to apologize to him in front of all our relatives or else he'll kill him and bury him in front of everyone.\n\nHe's had this kind of behavior before, but nowhere near as intense as this.\n\nHe starts just screaming and yelling at my mom and threatening to leave her. Her face is soaked with tears. He was taking pleasure in her suffering and  was enraged. I almost punched him at one point in fact. He saw my mother crying and just went up to her to yell at her for fun. He was terrifying her. Eventually though he did take a break and leave the room. I hugged her to comfort her after he walked out of the room.\n\nHe comes back in and I glance at him. He tells me to stop fucking staring at him (yes, he said fucking, I wasn't putting that in there for drama). I snapped and screamed at him in front of both him and my mom that I'll do whatever the fuck I want to him before calling him a piece of shit.\n\nHe looked at me and said some threats or something like that. I can't remember exactly what. Anyway, he stomped over to me and started making motions as if he wanted to grab me or punch me or something. I kept pushing his arms away. Eventually my mom got between us and screamed for us to stop. So my dad gave up and just stomped over to the other side of the room and looked at me before calling me the \"n-word\" twice (We're both white by the way). After that he stormed out of the room.\n\nSomehow my mom was shocked by this and told me to apologize to him. She's a big catholic, so she just said that she could handle it with prayers and such. So I followed her instructions. Eventually I walked over to the car where  was packing up. He walked back into our living room where I nervously apologized to him. He just calmly said that he respected me for standing up for my mom. Then he just said this is all my grandpa's fault, and continued getting ready to leave.\n\nHe had been drinking maybe an hour before he took off by the way.\n\nI think he's mentally ill or something. I don't hate him or seek vengeance honestly. He seems almost bipolar. He needs help. My mom is underestimating this and thinks he just has a big ego. He definitely does, but I think there's more than that alone. He's got to be narcissistic at the very least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease don't get involved or call the law or anything. My mom and I are dealing with that part. I just felt the need to post how he acted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**UPDATE:** My dad ended up sleeping at a friends house and coming back the day after I wrote this post. He claims to be sorry, but he's done this many times before. Just after he apologized to us, I heard him screaming violently in the garage. I'm really concerned. I don't know if he'll ever improve. What I do know is that I'm not close to him any more, and I won't ever be close to him again.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Prior to that, my ex always talked about how much he hated that plant, that it was ugly, and I should throw it away. I asked him about the snapped branches and he'd say he knew nothing about it and maybe I bumped into it while dancing, cleaning, etc but didn't break until later as the trauma took awhile to set in. I didn't press because I did sometimes bump into it, but I just couldn't shake the feeling of it being weird that stems would break days later. (Btw, I still have that plant today and haven't had a broken stem since I moved out...but I also don\u2019t bump into it as much anymore)\n\n2) During my final discard (since he's now blocked lol) he was triangulating me with a lot of girls but there was one in particular he loved shoving in my face. He would say how much she wanted to fuck him and be his girlfriend etc. And then when he'd inevitably see the pain in my face he would tell me she was an ugly slut and no one can tie him down anymore and I'm reading too much into why he was telling me about her. The triangulation got so bad he posted on social media a video of them rolling all over each other and cuddling and random strangers were asking when they were going to fuck. I was stuck in a living situation with him at the time, but I was so furious that I called my friend and packed my shit the next day. Fast forward to a couple months later......... One of our mutual friends has a big event gathering at their house. I haven't seen my ex in months and have ignored his several booty call attempts. He responds that he's going, even though he hated our friend group. I hesitate for a minute but also adamant on not letting him prevent me from living my life. I respond in the group chat to count me in. My ex then asks if he can bring that girl he shoved in my face during the break up. I was obviously LIVID. I couldn\u2019t prove it but I knew in my heart he was doing this on purpose to hurt my feelings or force me out of the gathering. My friends told me he was just an idiot and didn't realize how much it would hurt me. But that is just unbelievable to me. Idiot or not, I truly believe someone who actually loved and respected me during the relationship would never do something like that based off the events that unfolded a couple months prior and my reaction to it (let alone dangle in front of me his freshest and shiniest replacement a week after our 8 year relationship ended - who by the way I met at the party and she was super sweet and cool) \n\n\nSome background on him. There were times where he did confess to doing weird things, but they were at a much smaller scale. e,g, The second time we ever hung out, I found some of my perishable food had been left out overnight. I can't remember whether he blamed it on me or said he just \"forgot\", but a couple years later he confessed he did it on purpose because I didn't run over to greet him as soon as he walked into my apt (we were having a house party so I was distracted. But also wtf, I had literally just met him once before). And another time he confessed to telling me he wanted to fuck a girl to make me jealous and hurt because he was mad at me about something. \n\n\nBut he hasn't confessed to everything and it sucks because there are a lot of things I can't prove were malicious...but it still hurts me so I end up feeling totally crazy. Especially when I try to talk out these memories with friends.\n\nHow do you guys deal with these memories? Do you let it go as probably nothing since you can\u2019t prove it? Or do you go with your instinct and accept it probably happened based on passed behaviors? Thank you &lt;3", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I dont want to post a lot of details, but what happened was around this time of year. \n\nIm worried he will contact me somehow. To give a tiny bit of context, before i met the narc, i had been in a physically abusive relationship for a long time. I got involved with the narc because my boyfriend refused to go back to his batterer's class and i couldnt be with him anymore. It was really bad. But, he wasnt a narcissist.\n\nAt the time, i didnt really think i could do any worse and i gave the narcissist a chance, despite all the red flags, because i was so lonely after the dissolution of my relationship. \n\nI was so wrong. Basically, the narc almost broke me. I almost killed myself and i realized that was his goal. To destroy me. It was very subtle. I think he is actually a sociopath. It was really horrific and when it happened i had no one to turn to, i didnt have any friends because i knew i had to cut him out of my life immediately, before he killed me or got me to kill myself.\n\nSo losing me had made my ex boyfriend re-evaluate his choices and go back to counseling for his anger issues. I didnt have anyone and reached out to him. He was very receptive and we had begun spending some time together again. It was nice to get my mind off the narc.\n\nWe started hanging out more. After about 6 months of me and my ex hanging out, and no contact whatsoever from the narc except for a weak hoover attempt 2 months after i quit talking to him, my ex and i got back together. Then the narc messaged him on facebook saying all sorts of lies about me. Like that i was a prostitute and my clients were all the male managers at his workplace. That i was turning tricks in peoples cars at the park and doing drugs. The narc even said he was still seeing me. Even though i had cut contact with him. He literally named his bosses by name and said i was screwing them for money in their cars in the walmart parking lot.\n\nThe problem was that my boyfriend knew none of that was true at all. Im kind of a prude, if im honest. And i wouldnt touch drugs ever. So he just thought it was hilariously funny. \n\nIt just shows me that despite the \"deep love\" he professed to have for me, the reality was, he didnt care enough to really know me at all, despite the fact that we had been together for about a year. If he did, he wouldnt have picked such OBVIOUS lies to try and smear me with. Im actually a very straightlaced girl. Also, i think its obvious the narc knew my ex had been abusive and the narc was trying to make him get angry and hit me.  \n\nAnd that is what i am trying to keep at the front of my mind, because i just know he is going to try and contact me this week.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

For the first month and a half everything was going great, until the end of month two.. we kinda started to become more affectionate towards each other while we\u2019d be texting, so I just basically went with the flow. Sooo one day, I had a really stressful day where someone basically robbed me out of over 500$. He continued to ask me what was wrong, why I was acting so different, if o had found someone else and I had just simply told him that I was under a lot of stress and that it had absolutely nothing to do with him.. Later on that night while on FaceTime, my feelings had settled down so I was starting to feel better..

He called an attorney to represent him because our landlord is \"harassing\" him.\n\nI thought I would showcase some narc logic here. These are the reasons he's being evicted, along with his explanations.\n\n1. Unauthorized resident living in our apartment. His response? The guy isn't a resident. He \"works\" for my husband and sometimes you sleep at work. Every night. And bring all your stuff over. He's there as an employee, not a resident. Keep in mind my husband doesn't work. He doesn't have employees. Anyway, since this guy is an employee it isn't valid.\n\n2. He planned to throw a rave in our apartment, starting at midnight on a weekday. Landlord got word of it and said no way. His response? Throw TWO raves. But that is also an invalid reason because no one complained (yes they did).\n\n3. Yet another guy was trespassed from the building, so my husband let him move in. He says they can't tell him who he can have stay with him, despite the fact that it is spelled out in the lease he signed. He says they can't tell him what to do, so that's invalid.\n\n4. Roaches and mice. My husband is the most dirty person I have ever met. He could drop a raw egg on the floor and just leave it, then demand to know why it is still there. We didn't have roaches and mice when I left because I took care of things. Now he does, and they're getting into the neighbors' apartments. His rationale? The neighbors are harassing him by complaining about the filth. The neighbors are assholes and the pests aren't his fault.\n\n5. Non payment of rent. He spent the money his mom gave him for rent on drugs. The landlord is in the wrong for not giving him a month to get back on his feet. She's harassing him by asking for rent.\n\nSo he called an attorney and told HIS version of events. I've been in litigation for over a decade and I know that no attorney is stupid enough to take that case once they see the lease and talk to the landlord. Based on the false facts, the attorney said he would look into it.\n\nHe is adamant any attorney will take it because what the landlord is doing is egregious harassment.\n\nI explained that no attorney will take this after they find out the truth.

Brain went to, \"WHO THE HELL IS HE TALKING TO ON THERE?\"\n\nOpened up our message thread. BIG MISTAKE. Got my drug \"hit\" for the first time in 6 weeks... boy was that a doozy. It was during the LOVE BOMB stage. The endless compliments! The late night phone calls! The adoration! The steamy sexts! The dick pics! The sweet communication when his actions MATCHED his words! The CONSTANT flattery!! Our jokes! The \"I cant wait to kiss you!\" \"Why are you so perfect?\" and the \"Looking at the ocean and wishing you were in my arms,\" etc, etc, etc BULLSHIT\n\nWHO WOULDNT FALL FOR THIS HANDSOME, ROMANTIC guy? I feel like it was SO easy to be duped. I know LOGICALLY  this was all a facade, but WTAF.... how could a person so drastically change from being the love of my life to a freaking stranger over the course of a year?\n\nMy brain has abuse amnesia and is fantasizing about our whirlwind soulmate romance at the beginning. Now I am so confused, missing him more than ever....or missing the LOVE BOMB version of him.\n\nI  quickly remembered the reason why I DELETED whatsapp  was he would use this CONSTANTLY as a form of abuse. After a few months he started to leave me on \"read\" and would be active online and CHOOSE to ignore me. This drove me insane to the point where I finally deleted and told him it made me painfully insecure.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I understand why NO CONTACT is all encompassing. Even the LOVING MEMORIES of our abuser is debilitating.\n\nThoughts on how to recover from this upheaval? I am romanticizing and cannot stop.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When our daughter (2) spills something, he usually says she is making a 'huge' mess. When she touches something with sticky hands, he immediately comments on how we now need to thoroughly wash EVERYTHING. I can understand his strategy of limiting messes by washing hands after eating and keeping an eye on her when she is, but kids make messes, y'know? I feel like handing him a towel (ala Hitchhiker's Guide) sometimes and saying 'Don't panic'...\n\nOn Monday, our daughter got sent home from daycare with a fever. He had stayed home sick from work. Daycare didn't reach me, so they called him. He called me but I was in the middle of an impromptu meeting with my boss at work. He didn't reach me, so he left text messages and the visible one on my phone was about how he was struggling to breathe. So I panic and call him without reading the rest. I have no idea about my daughter at this point. So he fills me in, then asks if I read anything he sent me... no, you said you were struggling to breathe. I don't remember what was said next, I just remember hanging up stressed out and feeling like everything was falling apart. I read the messages and he said our daughter was very sick, more panic sets in. He calls back and it is established that he feels sore from coughing. I'm sure he legit was struggling to breathe, but he isn't in danger, and I feel a little angry that he led me to believe he was. Our daughter just had a mild fever, as well. He then proceeds to attempt to both convince me he is feeling terrible and reject any need for assistance. I feel slightly guilted, but family really does come first here so I head home early.\n\nYesterday he discovered our government is likely cancelling a program that reduces the cost of our daycare. Cancelling that would, at her age, double the price tag. We can likely absorb the increased cost, but it would make our budget tight. He spent a bunch of time angrily ranting about how we can't afford this increase to our daycare bill and all the measures he deems necessary to afford it and complains about how we won't be able to have any fun anymore. I stay quiet, fearful of triggering him more, because if I say anything that's not uncontestable, he WILL contest it. He'll talk over me and interrupt and I feel like he's telling me he knows better. He declares he isn't having any dinner (not eating is a trigger for getting angry) and leaves me to feed our daughter. At least he finished cooking first, when a year ago he probably would have stormed off with the food still cooking. Later in the evening, he finds out that due to the way the previous government had set it up, it would be at least a year and a half before the program ends, and only IF the current government is sure they want to cancel it - no legit announcements had been made, it was only a daycare leaving the program citing uncertainty. So no more budgetary panic. But I wish he had at least double checked the information before panicking and unloading, or perhaps talked to me about it calmly rather than trigger my anxieties about whether an angry blow-up and yelling are about to ensue.\n\nI feel like I am minimizing to offset his exaggeration. It's never as terrible as he makes it out to be, and it sometimes involves sometimes dictating commands to try and minimize his own (seemingly obvious) anxieties.\n\nSometimes I feel him blowing everything out of proportion is just a sick system and he's trying to keep the disaster level high. Other times I feel like I'm not validating his emotions.\n\nWhat's your opinion?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I blacked out and the next day my fraternity brothers told me one of our brothers (who is openly gay) was rolling on MDMA and rubbing my head and had his hands on my legs and was trying to put it closer to my dick i think? I'm not really sure, they told me in the morning when I woke up but i had a horrible hangover and forgot most of the morning when I woke up.

I am straight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure if the brother who touched me was also drunk, I just know he was on molly when we left for the bars. He got touchy there and was hugging us a lot (which i am ok with and is pretty normal, i usually just put one arm around him and rub his back because it feels good when you're on mdma but that's usually the extent of my physical touch with people on it).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm afraid to ask them for more details because I'm afraid of what they might tell me, I know they'd be supportive but it's just so hard to get myself to talk about this.

I\u2019m still having a hard time accepting it but know that I have some part to do with it. Back when I was 6 yrs old, my cousins, lets say Pam (8yrs old at the time) and Paul (7 yrs old), had found a CD from their older brother (16m). They played it and saw sexual intercourse of a couple and that\u2019s where we learned what sex was and began sexual acts between eachother. I don\u2019t remember when it stopped but I had completely forgotten about it until my cousin, Paul, started to bring it up as a joke. Paul and I are a couple months apart, but he\u2019s still older than me by 9 months or so and around this time we\u2019re both around 12-13 yr old. Pam was in the room when he brought it up. Pam is completely ignoring the conversation while Paul continues to ask if I remember it. Paul starts to laugh about it, but I immediately become uncomfortable because I learned that it was bad to do these things for our age/being related. I remember I began to say that they had found the CD and played it when we shouldn\u2019t have been watching that. Suddenly, Pam and Paul explode and start blaming me saying that I was the one that wanted to start doing the sexual acts between us. I was in complete shook because I didn\u2019t think I would say or initiate. I continued to deny because I could not believe they would blame me for what happened since I was 5 at the time and had no idea what sex was. This is where I stopped hanging out and asking to go to their place. I held a lot of guilt and was confused. I have a lot of trust issues and anxiety between my family members. I\u2019m not close to any of them because of what happened. My family knows that I\u2019m not close to any of my cousins nor keep in contact with family as they do, but they don\u2019t know the reason why. I would never tell my parents because i\u2019m ashamed of it all. Soon after I stopped visiting, my parents decided to move for job reasons and I didn\u2019t have to worry about lying about not going over to see my cousins. I\u2019m now almost 21 yr old and I do occasionally see them for events and act normal/have conversation. We aren\u2019t around eachother for longer than a weekend. Since I\u2019m in school, my mom usually has my dad take her and I always make an excuse not to go. But it being summer and my mom not being able to drive for long periods of time, I had no other option but to go. It was only for a weekend and we usually tolerate eachother. I didn\u2019t think it would be too bad. But when I went to visit, I noticed that I was becoming very anxious about being around them. It became too obvious to my aunt that I did not wanna be there. I felt bad because my mom really wanted to see her sister and I felt like I was ruining her vacation. I sucked it up and spent most of the weekend walking around stores to avoid being at my aunt\u2019s house. I recently started becoming more anxious since for a few months, I remembered another incident that happened with another older cousin (dad\u2019s side of the family, 11m, when I was way younger since I remember that I was wearing a pink onesie). While our parents were cooking, my cousin kept unzipping my onsie and trying to suck on my nipples and stick fingers in places. I kept trying to leave to be in the kitchen with my parents but since I was young, I was considered in the way and my parents kept forcing me to be in the room with my cousin. I don\u2019t know if at the time I knew it was bad, I just knew that I did not want to be there. I\u2019m completely cut off by this cousin since my aunt divorced and my then uncle took custody of them/cut ties with us. He\u2019s not a worry but the incident still bothers me. I know now that I do not want to keep being in contact with Pam and Paul for the sake of my own mental health because I feel myself dissociating with friends, family, and my SO because I can\u2019t talk to anyone in person about this. I\u2019m scared of how they\u2019ll react overall and worry about what will happen to my mom\u2019s relationship with my aunt since it has nothing to do with both of them. \nOverall I\u2019m trying to come to terms that I was abused by my other cousin but not sure how I feel about being an instigator as a child for the sexual acts I did with Pam and Paul. I know I can\u2019t blame myself since I was a kid, but I know my cousins do. I\u2019ve never vented about this nor wanted to write it down for fear someone in my family  would find it. I do feel some sense of relief that none of my family members use reddit and I\u2019m a stranger here. I would like to open up to my SO but so much is holding me back.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Our family has 5 members: parents, me and two younger brothers, each of which is seperated by 7 years of age. I was lucky to be born into a family who love me and would not force to do anything they please just like the old typical Asian family type.  \n\n\nOr that's how it appears on the outside.  \n\n\nThe years before was hard on the country and the economy before they become as strong as they are currently (it was around 2000-2007). Dad just lost everything because he was tricked by people and didn't receive help. He, with my mom and me as a young infant, had to live in very downgraded rooms in a short time (not an apartment or studio, yikes). He had to work really hard because not only he needed a lot of money to improve living condition of the whole family, but to ensure something good for us in the future. He worked hard, super hard to gain the medium-level income that would support everyone for a few couple of years. As I am now, 20 years old, I really understand that work pressure can lead to conflicts, anger, etc. It's not avoidable.  \n\n\nI was told to be the most loved one before my second brother was born; everything I wanted, my family would buy immediately; what I needed, they would supply immediately with no questions asked. In short, they are doing everything to ensure that I wouldn't have to work like how they used to be after war, when nobody had anything or enough to live. Until now when I was scolded, dad still rant about how I was treated like a \"god-damn prince\", \"keep on dreaming\" and \"not knowing a shit about life\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, here's how most of the stuffs began to form.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was in grade 2, I know some random high school kids from my apartment building we moved to a year before. We hanged out like normal kids for the first few days then he invited me to a cafe bomb nearby to play some online Chinese FPS games. I believe that was when my passion to gaming-related was strengthened. I enjoyed that a lot. Then one day, these kids told me to steal my parent's money to go play and buy in-app currency cards. I was a young boy, I couldn't understand what was right or wrong since my family never educated me about it. Days after days until I was found out, dad raged and would beat me from the front door with a house broom, forced me to drag myself to the bed inside, facing down to get more beating. I then stopped playing with those kids, but I love games so I still remained playing games. Unfortunately, due to long exposure to those degenerates, I got all the bad habits (lying, stealing) from a very young age without understanding that it was wrong.  \n\n\nThings kept going after that, more and more beating and scolding were pointed toward me. I think it was around 2-4 times per week with increasing in frequency after some time.  Aside from all those beatings related to what I mentioned above, I found things in school hard to catch up because teachers then (until high school) never really explained thoroughly of the lectures, activities, etc. I did what people told me and went where they said like a brain-dead dog, I was bullied, etc. Back at home, parents looked at my result and scolded me for not focusing at studies, being \"stupid, no-brain, easy\" to be tricked and bullied. Then after every scolds, they always tried to comfort me. Nowadays when they do that, I find those comforts to be useless and, somewhat ironic, as if they think I would recover after a long, harsh scold by a soft comfort.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTime after time, I grew immune to scolds, and even tried to defile my parents, despite their efforts to reason with me with scolds, beats, etc. One time dad hit me in the toilet with a tablet, breaking it, resulting in me getting a nosebleed. I was around 12-14 that time, and unlike when I used to cry and beg for forgiveness, I stared at him with hate and cursed him inside my head. From that moment, I developed an instinct, as when dad is about to come home frustrated, or that he calls me in with a bad attitude, I know a storm is about to come.  \n\n\nTime went by, and the family's mood grew more and more negative. As I went to college (and made a grave mistake last year that forced me to start over at another university as a freshman) and returned home, everyday has been like in hell, with countless scolds and rants, sometimes beat, that could last for 3-6 hours, same thing over and over that tired me. For mom, she had to endure his scolds for nearly 7-10 hours because of money issues. He told me (and mom) that we \"are used to being lazy, so goddamn stupid that you couldn't even work and study properly; wasted a lot of money; always pick the easiest thing to do and afraid of hardship; would get a shit future if things progress like this, etc\". I, since coming back, never wanted to be at home, never wanted to appear to him and just wanted to be alone, minding my stuffs and try to improve myself. But he would always try to call me back and scold because \"he makes money and carries the burden of the whole family so he has the authority to scold\", with one difference is that he would spend so much time of others scolding and repeating the same thing over and over.  \n\n\nI know that I'm not a good son at all, even worse. But I never felt wanting to improve when parents keep bringing me down, calling me \"useless brat for avoiding things, and not trying hard like I used to\". I always, since young, feel insecure about my surroundings, no trust on others and can't control my emotion well. I never want to disappoint my dad, let alone not making him mad, but most of the time I feel like I'm forced to do this and that. I could never understand, though I do know, why I have to wake up early and sleep late; study hard and never give up; care for others because parents never give me an actual experience to make me understand. Sometimes they would compare me to other kids of being inferior, and that if worse cases happen, \"would join a gang, commit crimes and even kill your own family for money\" - this is typical in some Asian country - while inside my mind, I just want to commit suicide because I 'understand' that I'm a burden of this house and that dying will lose them a burden of the family.  \n\n\nAlright, that's enough of my venting and confession.

But a year and a half out the gate, I'm so proud to say that it does not hurt at all anymore, and hasn't for a while. And I'm not angry anymore either-- totally neutral.\n\nIn the beginning, it was excruciating because I was unwrapping myself from the lie that our relationship was based on some \"spiritual connection,\" that he was the only person who would ever \"get\" or \"love\" me. I stalked him on social media SO HARD, wondering how he could just up and leave for new women after all we had been through, after all the work I did, in spite of our \"connection,\" etc.\n\nA few months in, when I realized I was waiting for a phantom and that this guy wasn't my \"Twin Flame\" or whatever, I felt this incredible void that I attempted to fill with other crushes. During this time I became obsessed with two undergrads (I was finishing a PhD at the time). It wasn't good.\n\nThen, once I finished school (which was also driving me crazy) and moved to NYC to begin life anew 10 months ago (!), I began to heal more rapidly. Men were interested in me openly, which I used to keep filling the void...\n\nThis is when I started to get angry, and allowed myself to feel it. This board was KEY... thank you all so much.  And as I felt angry, I felt increasingly empowered and began to remember the sense of self that I had lost during the course of that relationship. \n\nI didn't look at his social media for 5 months and blocking him on everything was also SO KEY in helping me focus on my life without him... the life I now love and appreciate. And after about a year and change, I stopped caring completley.\n\nI've dated around in NYC and learned a lot about myself.  I'd be lying if I said i dated all nice guys post-Nex (although, to be fair, they were all better to me than him, lol). But most of these dudes were still dysfunctional... and I realized:\n\nThis void is what kept me in the Nex relationship, and is what drew me to unavailable men afterward. The void... low self-esteem, falsely believing I couldn't do better, not even knowing (Allegory of the Cave-style) that something better-- something GOOD, a REAL connection,  what I actually want and deserve-- is out there.\n\nI recently met someone who, while definitely not perfect, is wonderful. And for the first time in my life, I actually have the self-esteem to NOT jump in: to take it slow, see if it's right for me, and let it develop naturally all while focusing on what I deserve. I've detached.\n\nAnd this, my friends, is what I realized about the Nex relationship, and about my own void that put me there: I accepted a fantasy of a relationship because I didn't love myself enough to believe (or even conceive) of a relationship where I was cherished and appreciated on the levels that are now my baselines (physical, emotional, spiritua). \n\nIt was like ANY relationship was better than NO relationship. And it was this same false thinking that drew me to innapropriate men afterward, that kept me mired in obsession... this isn't to say that the Nex didn't groom me, because the relationship dynamic (as you all know from experience, Goddess bless) reinforced this latent low self-esteen with the mindfuck that was Love Bombing followed by Devaluing and Discard cycles. But at then end of the day, it has been empowering to continually realize that I (we) have CHOICE... and although it's scary at first to choose ourselves and trust that everything else will fall into place, it is SOOOO much better on the other side. I'm so fuxing proud of myself.\n\nAnd I forgive myself. 100%. None of this qas my fault. And I'm actually grateful for the experience with the Nex, because it taught me empathy (especially toward myself) and gave me an exact baramoter of what a relationship SHOULDN'T feel like.\n\nWishing you all the best of the best. Thank you for your support...  I'm here for you on your journeys, too.\n\nxxoxooxo", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

To him, the people around him are simply a means to an end that he is forced to deal with in order to get what he wants.

I have decided after 2+ years of working together that it\u2019s time to ask him to leave.\n\nDo I come up with some sort of lie/half truth that does not directly address my issues with him but rather makes it seem as if I am no longer able to provide a space for him to work for other reasons?\n\nOr do I try to explain to him how I feel about working with him, not in an accusatory or angry way but in an honest calm way.

It\u2019s been 2 years since we broke up and in that time I\u2019ve been working through the abuse with the help of my friends, but mostly by myself, as I haven\u2019t yet been able to find/afford a therapist who would suite me\n\nI\u2019m an (almost) psychologist and have also had training in therapy for three years so I\u2019ve been doing an okay job with working through the emotional and physical abuse whilst I wait to find a therapist, but the sexual abuse is something I\u2019ve been struggling with the most.\n\nLast night, I was putting on a PJ shirt I hadn\u2019t worn in a couple of months.

For some reason I was feeling like I had overcome an addiction or something. Then I started to correlate it to an actual drug addiction and did some research on it. Holy shit! I wasn't just a heart broken man trying to get over a lost love. Nope, I developed an chemical addiction and went though some really hard core withdrawals!!!! Think about it! There are brain chemicals that are released when we fall in love and the Narc is very good at making those chemicals flow freely. They're experts at it really. Turns out it wasn't love, I was addicted to the love chemicals running through my body and didn't even know it! This explains why deep down I hated her but it also felt so good having her in my life. It also explains why I struggled so badly after she left; I didn't know I was going through chemical withdrawals! I researched the stages of addiction and listed them below. Give it a read and compare this to your Narc experience. Knowledge is power and this may help you understand why we struggle with this so much. It this makes sense, it may actually change the game on your recovery. I wish you all the best.\n\n   \n\nStages of Addiction:\n\n* Initial use (Who is this person I just met and wow wow  wow!)\n* Abuse (engaging in the relationship regularly and enjoying the \u201chigh\u201d. OMG, this feels so good)\n* Tolerance (an indication that the brain has changed in response to continual use of the drug)\n* Dependence (the body or brain becomes dependent on having the substance to be able to function properly)\n* Addiction (11 signs and symptoms of addiction)\n   * Using more of the substance than the person originally planned\n   * Being unable to stop using the substance\n   * Experiencing relationship problems based on substance use\n   * Spending large amounts of time seeking or using the substance, or recovering from use\n   * Reducing participation in favorite activities in favor of substance use\n   * Being unable to keep up with daily responsibilities due to substance use\n   * Craving the substance\n   * Continuing to use the substance despite negative health effects\n   * Regularly using the substance in dangerous situations (while driving or operating machinery, etc.)\n   * Developing tolerance for the substance, as described above\n   * Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when use is stopped\n* Withdrawal (emotional instability, anxiety, depression, heartache, and pain)", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

No matter how much I did, I was always unsupportive and these other people were all so supportive - despite me objectively doing a lot more for my SO than they did.\n* They would use the big issues in their life to deny me any support for smaller issues. Literally telling me \"my problems are more important than yours\" when I would ask for support.\n* They would routinely throw my attempts at support back in my face (ex: \"I'm so sorry you got fired\" - \"that doesn't help me or solve anything\")\n* They would get annoyed if I was sad about something they \"had more right to be sad about\", like their dog dying (that I knew well).\n* They would hold on to hardships for what I feel to be an inappropriately long time.

They blamed their existing grief over their dead sibling on me because I'm not making them feel better about it.\n* When I would pull away due to their abusive behavior (above and way more), I would get chastised too. They felt as if I should be there for them despite their behavior towards me. \n\nI mean, there's way more but I'm rambling. I recognize that I'm not the most empathetic person, nor an I good at supporting people. But I still feel these behaviors were very inappropriate. I feel like my ex was childish, entitled, and generally extremely shit whenever they were experiencing hardship\n\nBasically\n\n1. Are these normal human behaviors? Like... Is all of this abusive or stem from it or not? I am having a hard time differentiating in these circumstances. Am i crazy?\n\n2. Are there any good resources to read up on the subject (of the abusive partner experiencing grief or hardship)? Articles, books, personal anecdotes - anything really. It was definitely a big source of fuel for my abusive relationship and I'd like to read about it", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I believed everything she said and dug myself into a financial hole to cover the both of us.

She even said to me that she waited until she could support herself to walk away. \n\nI supported her financially, holistically, for years. Tolerated endless torment- degrading me against my body, against my past before her, the career progressions I was taking and every day garbage. It was a waking nightmare. She was constantly trying to make me hate myself all the way until the very end.

What I\u2019m struggling with is where to start, I\u2019ve long said he\u2019s a narcissist but upon further reading he\u2019s showing sociopathic signs. Here\u2019s a copy &amp; paste from my notes of things I\u2019ve remembered. Sorry it\u2019s a very long post but I would really appreciate your opinion on wether he\u2019s a narcissist or sociopath so I can describe it to my counsellor x\n\nFrom notes: \nMet on a website that\u2019s specifically looking for casual sex, first meeting in a hotel 14/5/2011 said I couldn\u2019t meet at his house because he had his dad staying with him but it turned out it was the other way around, he was living with his dad!\nTold me he loved me within 2 weeks of meeting, swept me off my feet with romantic gestures and made me feel like a queen and his whole world. The sex was amazing too!\n\nApproximate dates:\n\nJanuary 2017\nThrew a glass of wine in my face because I woke him up singing with my headphones in. \n\nFebruary 2017\nAlso cut the wire to my headphones for the same reason. \n\nAugust 2011\nSaid we couldn\u2019t move in together if I brought the cats. So I rehomed them. \n\nJune 2011\nAt the start of the relationship as I had cheated on my ex and finished the relationship to be with him my son would not speak to me. He made a show of saying he couldn\u2019t be responsible for the breakdown of my relationship with my son &amp; said we should split up, I agreed but within 10 minutes he was crying saying he couldn\u2019t do it.  A couple of weeks later he told me he might have bowel cancer and that he had to go to hospital for a colonoscopy. I\u2019ve since realised that this is a procedure he has to get periodically to monitor his colitis. \n\n\nEarly 2015??\nSulked when I wouldn\u2019t sell my car so we could buy a shared one that he could use to visit his children so he didn\u2019t have to take the van. Moaned &amp; sulked so much I gave in. \n\nNovember 2015??\nLeft me to go to hospital in an ambulance on my own after an overdose &amp; wouldn\u2019t answer his phone when I was discharged in the early hours of the morning.  My brother had to come get me. \n\nSummer 2015\nAfter splitting up again, I can\u2019t remember the reason but threatened to tell my adult son that I\u2019d had a threesome. \n\nBetween 2014 &amp; 2016\nOn at least 6 occasions has tried to get me to give up my dogs, has said I don\u2019t look after them properly. Used the ultimatum it\u2019s him or the dogs, this is one of the few times I didn\u2019t allow him to get his way. \n\nFrom around 2014\nComplains the house get dirty because I leave the door wedged ajar for the dogs to get access to the garden when I\u2019m at work but repeatedly refuses to fit a dog flap. \n\nModelling early 2014 new job May 2015\nSeems to kick off when something special is happening for me, the day before I started a new job he started an argument &amp; finished the relationship. Also when I won a modelling competition he didn\u2019t even bother complimenting any of the photos. Was moody about it. \n\nMid 2015\nLaughed at table decorations I had made for our wedding, I asked him to help &amp; the one he made looked like a child had made it. \n\nAugust 2015\nCancelled said wedding 9 weeks before the day. \n\nEarly 2012\nTold me to change my outfit when we were going out for lunch with his family because it looked scruffy. \n\nFebruary? 2012\nBecause things were still raw with my son over the nature of how he &amp; I got together his name wasn\u2019t on the invite to my nephews wedding, he sulked about this and convinced me I shouldn\u2019t go if they weren\u2019t going to accept him.  After telling my sister &amp; nephew I wouldn\u2019t be going to the wedding there were lots of tears from us all. I couldn\u2019t bear to hurt my family so I changed my mind and said I would go. After telling him this he got angry because I \u201ccouldn\u2019t make up my mind\u201d. Silent treatment for rest of evening. Even on the morning of the wedding he left the house early and wouldn\u2019t give me a lift into town. \n\nSeptember 2012\nWhen on holiday in Ibiza we got into an argument because he wasn\u2019t happy that I had drank too much. He walked off and left me in a strange street at 1 or 2am ish I eventually managed to find my way back to the apartment about an hour later. \n\nAugust 2014\nWent off on one when my dog had to get emergency surgery to remove a nail from her stomach that she had swallowed. The pet insurance had lapsed so I had to put the bill, which was around \u00a31000, on to my credit card.  His opinion was I should have just got her put to sleep!  He told me he wouldn\u2019t be paying a penny towards it so I stopped smoking to enable me to pay it off. \n\nJuly 2014\nHumiliated me in front of his children, after we had fallen out I was trying to put on a brave face for them. He said to them while sitting eating dinner \u201clook at her miserable face\u201d and laughed. \n\nmid 2015 \nHe was stopped seeing his children because he upset one by jokingly putting hand wash in their mouth after they said a swear word. He had to go to court to get access which is limited to 3 hours every third Sunday. \n\nLate 2012\nSaw him once grab his oldest child by the throat when he answered him back. \n\nSeveral times over the years:\nTold me when his ex wife was moving her final things out the house she insisted on the police being there. He said it was absolutely ridiculous.  Has always had nothing but negative things to say about her. I\u2019ve met her only twice &amp; she was civil both times. \n\nFebruary 2012\nEarly on in living together I was late home from work because I was sitting in my car talking to my son on the phone. He accused me of going off to meet someone else. Later he had looked at my mobile and demanded to know who the people (men) I had blocked on Facebook were. \n\nAugust 2011\nConvinced me to delete my email account and create a new one and he would do the same. This meant I lost my Flicker account too so my photography hobby got put on hold. \n\nBetween 2014 to present \nOn many occasions has thrown things around in a fit of rage. Damaging or breaking items. The police have been called on 3 occasions. \n\nLate 2014\nSaid he was happier before he met me that his life has gone downhill since we met.  He never apologises to me after his rages. \n\n2/3/19\nHas admitted he\u2019s addicted to painkillers. Said I had to admit I have a drink problem. \n\n2/3/19\nAfter the final split I told him I would be taking the dogs into the bedroom with me to comfort me. He was shouting that no that wouldn\u2019t be happening, he said \u201ctry it, see what happens \u201c i became frightened of what would happen if I took the dogs upstairs so called the police just to make them aware that it might kick off, that I didn\u2019t want anyone to attend. The police said the have to attend in a domestic incident. They talked to us and suggested to him that he leave for the weekend to allow things to calm down but he refused. He agreed that he would stay calm. After they left he told me he\u2019d done something stupid, he said \u201cI\u2019ve slashed the mattress, I was just so angry about you wanting the dogs upstairs\u201d. When I looked he had indeed slashed the mattress &amp; bottom sheet. I still have the sheet &amp; a picture of the mattress.  I opened a bottle of wine and poured half a glass, when he saw I was drinking wine he said \u201cyou\u2019re not getting drunk\u201d then took the bottle and poured it down the sink. There was also a bottle of white wine in the fridge that he took and started to pour down the sink, when I tried to stop him he shoved me away. Later when I tried to go upstairs with the dogs he kicked off again, was shouting at the dogs to get down, one came into the bedroom with me and I tried to block him coming in the door he shoved the door open knocking me away and grabbed the dog by the collar and dragged her downstairs. I had called my friend and she called the police who called me and suggested I remove myself from the house immediately so I took the dogs and locked us in the car until the police arrived. The police came into the house with me so I could gather some overnight things to stay at my friends house. \n\n2014 to present \nAs soon as we bought the house the previously healthy sex life became nonexistent, he would shrug me off if I tried to initiate sex often leaving me in tears which he would then get angry about and say he\u2019d had enough of this that he wanted to split up. I would then get the silent treatment for 2 or 3 days then we would talk it over when he decided he was ready. I quickly learned it was easier to stop trying resulting in us having sex no more than twice a year for the last five years. Whenever I tried to talk to him about it he would try to blame me for him not wanting sex,  he said he didn\u2019t want to have sex with me if I\u2019d been drinking so I stopped drinking. Then it was because I was too fat so I joined SlimmingWorld and lost almost 4 stone but none of it made any difference. He then said it was because of his medication and that he would ask for it to be changed but that never happened. \n\nMid 2015\nAbout 4 years back my mental health was at rock bottom and I became paranoid, I was convinced he was having an affair and confronted him, he got angry and when I started crying he wouldn\u2019t comfort me. I asked to look at his phone but he refused. A few days later we were arguing about it again and he said that yes he was having an affair with a woman called Julie. I was actually very calm about it and asked how long it had been going on, he then backtracked and said he was only joking, that he wasn\u2019t really seeing anyone. \n\n\n\nHe makes me feel useless, like I\u2019m not good enough for him. He tries to confuse me when arguing and denies things he\u2019s said making me doubt myself. He doesn\u2019t like to be wrong and if I prove him wrong he denies he said whatever it is in the first place. He will say I\u2019m making it up, say I\u2019m just like his ex wife trying to control him. When we\u2019ve split up in the past he\u2019s told me that I will have to leave the house because I can\u2019t afford it on my own.  The last time we split up he said I\u2019d made his life a misery when I asked how he said \u201cyou think you\u2019re so perfect, little miss high &amp; mighty\u201d. \n\nHe has removed items I have brought into the house and thrown them away and denied ever seeing them. Things like books, pictures or ornaments, sometimes I would be doubting myself but other times I knew they had definitely been there and gone missing. He said I bring a load of crap into the house. He has got his own way in all the decor &amp; colour schemes we have, if he doesn\u2019t like something I want it does not get bought and even if I buy it with my own money, like I said it often disappears. \n\nWhile we were renovating the house I still paid my share of the bills but I took on the financial responsibility of paying for all food/grocery shopping. He only started contributing to half the groceries in March 2017 when we started SlimmingWorld together.  Even then the \u201chalf\u201d doesn\u2019t cover the monthly food bill. \n\nIf I had to take a day or 2 off work after we split up due to mental health (having to take diazepam from the doctor) he would get angry with me. \n\nDuring 2014 I had to take off about 3 months sick from work due to mental health and he wasn\u2019t happy about that, he said \u201cit\u2019s alright for you! You can take off whatever time you want and get paid for it, I can\u2019t, I just have to get on with it!\u201d  During that time he would often push me away when I was looking for comfort from a hug, it made me feel hopeless and I spiralled into a deeper depression. I still take medication for anxiety &amp; depression. I feel very jumpy around him it\u2019s like constantly walking on eggshells, I adjust my behaviour around him and don\u2019t feel like I can be completely myself. My dogs are frightened of him and as soon as he raises his voice they start shaking. Often if I fall asleep on the sofa, which he doesn\u2019t like me doing, he will come down stairs to wake me up but one of my dogs always starts barking at him like she\u2019s trying to protect me. He also took a picture of me lying asleep on the sofa drunk on a Saturday night and showed it to me saying look at the state of you. I asked him to delete it but I don\u2019t know if he did. \n\nNovember 2018\nWanted to split up again. Said he thinks he was just staying together because it was easier than financial difficulties of splitting up. Said he should never have married me (not for the first time).\n\nMay 2019\n\nTried to guilt trip me that he would have to live in a caravan\n\nPolice called again after I took the dogs in the bedroom. He tried to force the door and only stopped when I told him I was videoing it. That bent the door finishings. \n\nCried when told me he might not get a mortgage, told me if he had to he would sell the house. Self preservation.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

This cycle they carry on with... to play a person in the form AND manner they do... this is how they survive? This is what they thrive for? Such fucking sick, dirty people.\n\nI've been at my breaking point for months. Before him &amp; I hit a year, I had my speculations. Shady shit happening left AND right. I was the type of chick who was broken (been broken since childhood), but I had my shit together... my shit was falling apart when he came into my life... yet I kept my head high.\n\nHe broke me down man, fucking broke me. At heart, I know I'm better than this. So, why do I feel defeated? Just, why? I'm livid, beyond livid. \n\nOur relation-shit began mid 2018. I caught his eye at our job. I had been a worker there for 4 years, and 3 months... he was a brand new employee. \n\nHe was always staring at me, watching me... I'd see him out the corner of my eyes... fucking transactions up as he'd turn his head to follow my movements. Obviously, that amount of attention would flatter ANYBODY, especially a broken soul.\n\nNever in my life had I felt so wanted, or appreciated. His efforts began with pulling me aside to commend my work ethic, he assumed that I was in management. He'd compliment my walk, how I swayed my hips, held my head high, could do anything AND everything around the store. According to him, I was the most \"Beautiful Woman\" he had ever laid eyes upon. \n\nHis compliments made my heart flutter. Even though I had no intentions (at the time) to seek out a relationship, nor be in one, he pulled me in. Enter: The Lovebombing Phase.\n\nGifts would pour in, acknowledgment was at an all time high. He was intrigued with me, he put forth more effort than ANY other human had ever placed... I always swore I'd never fall for shit like this... especially since I grew up with estranged relatives whom are narcissist. Yet, he baited me, and lured me in.\n\nPrior to him, I had only slept with 2 dudes. First boyfriend being a narcissist himself. Second dude, he was inexperienced, shy, and it just didn't work. It had been 4 years since I slept with anybody. Advances other people gave, I'd turn down. Sex is something meaningful, at least to me... I felt dirty with the thought of giving myself to anybody just for the sake of \"Having sex\".\n\nI had lost my job, and after that, it was hook, line, and sinker. First meeting we had outside of working grounds, we had sex. Everytime he'd visit, it was always \"Sex\". He'd pretend to show interest and like all the things I initially liked... Now, I know it's a facade.\n\nI lost my home, had to move 2 hours away with family (The narcissists), so we became long distance. \n\nEvery few weeks/months, he'd promise to visit... but once it came down to the day before, something would happen. He either \"Has enough money to get here, but doesn't have enough to get back\", \"Lost his job\", or \"He does so much for everyone, and is mad cause I don't do as much as him\".\n\nFor one, he knows I'm agoraphobic, suffer from severe anxiety, am severely depressed, AND have C-PTSD. These were things he'd throw in my face consistently. He'd compare me to his \"Past friends (Who were female)\" that went through abuse as well, but they can leave the house... THEY aren't held back.... well, newsflash buddy, I'M NOT THEM!! \n\nLast week, he told me \"I'll visit this coming Wednesday\". Later that evening, he changed it to \"The following Wednesday\". \n\nYesterday afternoon, we fought. He was telling me he took up an offer to work \"7 days straight for 4 weeks to set up the fair\", didn't know when it'd start, he says. However, he was off yesterday (Wednesday), tomorrow (which is today), and the day after... 3 days! \n\nI mentioned that it would've been a good time to visit, he says \"I didn't know I'd be off 3 days till last night\".... 2 hours pass. Then, he tells me \"Boss just found work for tomorrow, a college football game\".... \n\nCollege football season begins in August... college is out for the summer... how many more lies is he gonna tell me? At this point, I'm done.\n\nHe hasn't texted back all day... I'm sick of it, I'm done with it, I'm hurting from it all... I don't even know what to say at this point... just sick of the bullshit.\n\n\nTL;DR: Met a dude at work, he lovebombed me, I fell for it. He used me for sex, I lost my home, we're now in an LDR. He keeps promising to visit me, yet lies and excuses himself from doing so. I'm beyond fed up, yet hurt by his lack of action.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don't really remember what she said since my memory of that night is very foggy, but i do remember that my dad had snapped. He poured alcohol down her throat because he was so mad at her causing my sister and I pain. I didn't see it, I just remember that my mom was screaming hysterically. They ended up getting in a fight after that, my mom was hitting my dad and shuving him into furniture. I called 911 but for some reason they couldn't hear me at the other end of the phone and our location cannot be tracked using said phone.

{"post_id": "cf3hsu", "created_utc": 1563513707, "title": "5 Signs You Are in an Abusive Marriage", "author": "LearnToSayNo", "self_text": " \n\n1. ***Physical Abuse***\n\nIn theory, in this country, no one can touch you as adults in any way (physically or sexually) without your permission. At the horrendous end of the spectrum of physical abuse are the stories we hear about beating, burning, rape, mutilation, sex slaves etc. and at the lesser end of the spectrum we hear about people using their physicality to bully and get their way. In a healthy marriage the couple respect each other\u2019s physical boundaries and sex is a mutually agreed upon part of intimacy. In between the healthy and extremely unhealthy we find what we put up with, what we ignore, what we can\u2019t ignore, and finally what we can\u2019t accept anymore. Usually physical abuse is easier for the victim to identify with the right questions. We need to provide a safe place for the person going through physical abuse to speak about what is happening, knowing there is a strong emotional component denying, rationalizing, shaming and blaming one\u2019s self. If you are in a physically abusive relationship, hire a therapist qualified to help you safely leave the relationship. \n\n \n\n2. ***Emotional Abuse***\n\nEmotional abuse again can be on a spectrum from overt emotional abuse \u201cYou fat pig, you stupid idiot.\u201d To more subtle signs of abuse \u201cAre you really going to wear that?\u201d \u201cStill haven\u2019t figured out how to cook yet have you,\u201d, \u201cNo one would ever have you if you left me,\u201d \u201cHaven\u2019t you learned anything\u201d?. Even with these more subtle comments we can still identify the emotional abuse happening if we give the victim examples. One client was stunned when I gave her several examples of emotional abuse which she had numbed herself into believing were normal. Other types of abuse are when you are set up and or controlled. When one person has an important event he/she needs to prepare for and the partner feeling threatened and insecure, creates drama to sabotage the others success, this is a form of emotional abuse. When one partner wants to learn something new and the other feeling threatened makes fun of the new information this is also abuse. Lying is a very destructive form of emotional abuse as well. Many forms of emotional abuse are more difficult for the victim to identify due to some accommodating behavior to accept the abuse as normal. Emotional abuse also unfortunately, is the hardest for the courts to identify, so the person often feels abused by the spouse and by the court. A lot more work has to be done with identifying emotional abuse.\u00a0 If you feel you have been a victim of emotional abuse, hire a therapist, read books, attend workshops, so you can get the tools you will need to stop being a victim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3.** ***Emotional Neglect***\n\nOur partners commit to be our cheerleaders, have our backs, encourage us, give us empathy and compassion, care about our thoughts, ideas, and opinions, engage in conversations on a regular basis and provide a safe emotional environment. When one partner withholds this emotional support to punish or just because, we need to identify this behavior. Regular conversations of support are a cornerstone of a healthy marriage and a part of the asset bank of a marriage. If these are not happening, hire a therapist to see if you can get back on track. As we all know when the foundation has cracks the building is at risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4.** ***Physical Neglect***\n\nThe word marriage means we are partners and we have committed to being the best partner we can be. When you start withholding physical affection, touches, a sexual relationship, physical comfort, and generally acting like a roommate or withholding to punish you are not acting in a healthy manner. If both partners agree this is what they want we don\u2019t have a victim. If one wants a physical relationship \u201cHouston we have a problem.\u201d Hire a couples\u2019 therapist to get back on track.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5.** ***Your body is breaking down***\n\nMy assessment is your body will start to break down when you are lying to yourself. Anxiety and depression are classic signs of something is not right. Physical symptoms may also begin to develop. One woman told me she developed a tumor (benign) in her throat when she was in an abusive relationship and couldn\u2019t speak or stand up for herself. Being in an abusive marriage, triggers all the bad juices in your body and you need to be vigilant and not rationalize the symptoms away. Healthy marriages produce better health for both partners so making yours healthy if possible with therapy is an investment in you!\n\nThere are volumes written on all aspects of abuse so if you feel you are at risks don\u2019t put your head in the sand. Hire people qualified to help you with any form of abuse in your marriage.\n\n\u201cA healthy relationship doesn\u2019t drag you down. It inspires you to be better.\u201d Mandy Hale\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis article was originally published on Divorceforce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n ***\u00a9 2019 Dr. Anne Brown, Author of  Backbone Power The Science of Saying No***\n\n#### New Release!!\u00a0\u201cBackbone Power The Science of Saying No updated and abridged Audiobook\u201d narrated by Dr. Anne Brown, the author herself.

I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the one that\u2019s being hurtful or if I\u2019m being emotionally manipulated. \n\nMy boyfriend is currently in another state. We\u2019re having a baby soon and he left with the pretext of trying to figure things out for us in a different city since we don\u2019t wanna live in our home state. \nIn the mean time, I\u2019m staying with my sister so I can work, save money, etc. \n\n\nTwo days ago he calls me at 4 am. I was asleep and awoke to the call. He instantly asks what I\u2019m doing. I say I was sleeping. He proceeds to ask who I\u2019m talking to so late. I am still half asleep but his concern seems very real and I fully awake and assure him I was sleeping and his call woke me up. He insists I was awake and he can tell by my voice even tho I sound groggy. He says he can\u2019t be sure with me, but whatever, to forget it and go back to sleep. I\u2019m confused but say ok, and he hangs up. I can\u2019t go back to sleep tho. What triggered this so randomly? Everything was fine. I text him asking why he called asking these things, if he was ok, and that (this isn\u2019t the first time he accuses me of doing things I\u2019m not) it is annoying to me for him to accuse so aggressively and that I acknowledge his concern but I can be approached differently. He responds by saying that with me he can never be too sure. I\u2019m a liar and sneaky and he has to deal with this about me and accept it. \n\n -I grew up with abusive parents and often had to lie to them in order to go out or avoid being physically beaten. He is alluding to his because he knows about my past.-\n\nI am annoyed by it but try to be comprehensive and insist that I am being honest with him and we can talk about it. \nHe says we seem to get nowhere by talking. I have betrayed him before and he should take my advice (twisting my words) and it\u2019s better if he keeps quiet and lives his life. \n\n-This betrayal he\u2019s referring to is me talking to my male friends. He is extremely jealous and doesn\u2019t let me have male friends. Insists I\u2019ve fucked them all and if I love him I shouldn\u2019t need other men in my life. - \n\nI\u2019m upset at this point and he says he wants to stop talking about it. I ask if we\u2019ll talk later or pretend it didn\u2019t happen. He says \u201clet\u2019s pretend this didn\u2019t happen, i love you, bye\u201d. \n\nLater that day he calls again and we end up in a petty argument because he needs my bank information for something. I don\u2019t have enough money for it and he\u2019s clearly angry about it. He begins to talk outright rudely to me and says \u201cof course, forget it, I wouldn\u2019t wanna fuck you over, this was all a test to see if you\u2019re actually going to help me.\u201d I am mad at this point and tell him to call when he\u2019s in a better mood and needs help. I say it pretty angrily but I don\u2019t insult him. He says \u201cfine, bye\u201d. And hangs up abruptly.  \n\nDon\u2019t hear from him all day. I text him. Ask if he\u2019s ok, how it\u2019s going. I call. No answer. Doesn\u2019t answer till next day. He\u2019s responding curtly. No love, just dryness. He finally makes time to talk to me and his demeanor has changed. He acts aloof. Doesn\u2019t express love and says he\u2019s fine. Has to focus on himself and for me to just worry about myself and the baby because he\u2019s not taking care of us. I can\u2019t believe this. Says he has to work on his own thing and ready himself for his prime years. \nHe says he won\u2019t be working on finding us a place anymore because he\u2019s going to travel. He met some friends and they invited him to travel. I\u2019m just WTF.  Tell him he can\u2019t change our plans just because. He says plans change. Then he proceeds to try to make it seem like the original plan was always for him to ditch me and for me to work to save money for the baby. He\u2019s warping everything we had agreed on and I try calling him out. He responds by asking \u201cwhat? Can\u2019t be a single mom?\u201d He\u2019s being condescending and trying to joke with me. I am starting to feel overwhelmed at this point and can only say \u201cI love you, this isn\u2019t what I want, I thought we were going to get married and move in.\u201d \n\nHe says he won\u2019t take my abuse, my emotional lashing out and put downs. Says he won\u2019t be another one of my victims. That how could I think I could\u2019ve easily wrapped him into my game. Says he doesn\u2019t deserve my abuse and how could I lash out at him when he hasn\u2019t even done anything to me.  I am very upset at this point. \n\n-I\u2019ve opened up about my past two relationships with him and they were both abusive ones in which I was raped and had money stolen from me. -\n\nI\u2019m upset and crying at this point. I am begging him to stop being like this, why is he lying to me about leaving (this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done this - he often times makes up hurtful things when he\u2019s mad at me). He says he isn\u2019t lying. I say I\u2019m scared and he says \u201cgood sometimes I have to scare you.\u201d I\u2019m crying at this point and asking him to be real with me. He finally says he\u2019s not going anywhere but he could and he could backstab me just like I did to him (again, alluding to me talking to male friends). He says he knows I wanna laugh, I\u2019m downright crying and I don\u2019t look like I wanna laugh (we\u2019re video chatting btw). He looks like he wants to laugh tho. He says I play the victim card so well but he doesn\u2019t fall for it. Says I need to be put in my place. Asks if I\u2019m still going to live with him. I am beat down at this point and I say yes. I apologize to him. I can\u2019t think of anything else to do. I just wanna feel ok. I ask if he\u2019s still angry at me and if everything between us is ok. \nHe says, in an annoyed tone, \u201ceverything is better than ok.\u201d He can see I\u2019m beat and still crying. He tells me to go to sleep, he\u2019ll call me tomorrow. \n\n\nI guess that was his payback for me not complying the other day? I feel so sad. I\u2019m left wondering if I\u2019m evil and if I am manipulating him. Am I? Did I do something wrong? I don\u2019t talk to any of my male friends anymore even though they\u2019ve tried reaching out. They all ask if I\u2019m ok and ask if everything is alright but I never respond back. I just delete the messages because if my boyfriend ever saw them I know he\u2019d get livid. I even deleted all my social media to not be contacted. I would never cheat on my boyfriend and even tho I used to talk to my guy friends I never fucked any of them nor would I ever. \nI\u2019m feeling incredibly sad and betrayed and I\u2019m scared because my due date is in a few months. \n\nPart of me is telling me to just stay with my sister and another part of me loves him and wants things to work.

I\u2019ve asked a couple of friends diagnosed with autism about this and they seem to be in agreement with me. I also was sort of offended on their behalf when I first heard this claim from my ex. \n\nI found out from a mutual friend that my ex, who was highly and intricately manipulative, gaslit and triangulated me, internally absolved himself from all of his behavior, and says that \u201che\u2019s finally come to terms with the fact that he\u2019s just a little autistic\u201d. To be clear, he is certainly not diagnosed with anything. The closest he\u2019s come to any sort of diagnosis was when he and I both took the autism inventory and scored not likely to be autistic. His narcissistic family is generally averse to psychological professionals (considering psychology a pseudo-science, which my ex never let me, with my B.S. in Psych, forget), and has decided that his older brother is autistic because he is highly insensitive and very smart (particularly with math). His older brother routinely uses wit and sarcasm to tear people down (I was one of them). I know this isn\u2019t mutually exclusive with high functioning autism, but I\u2019ve just never seen that behavior before in my other friends (they are all actually incredibly kind people who just happen to occasionally say insensitive things).  \n\nAll of that said, autism does definitely run in his extended family. He has cousins who are severely autistic and uncles with Aspergers. He just doesn\u2019t seem to have any of the typical symptoms of autism outside of empathy issues and theory of mind deficits.\n\nWould someone with autism even be capable of being manipulative to the extent of crazymaking? Is there ANY reason to believe that an autistic person would gaslight? I feel like those two things especially would prove that this is not just the insensitivity of an autistic person, but high levels of narcissism/exploitation and manipulation.

I apologize in advance that this is so long but I\u2019d appreciate if you guys would give it a read and let me know what you think. I\u2019m feeling gutted and depressed.\n\nA little background: we met in 2017 on Bumble when he was traveling through the city I live in. We kept in touch for a couple of months during which time he would say/do little romantic things, such as making plans to come and see me (he was living in Iraq) and reading to me over WhatsApp. He was reading All The Pretty Horses. After about 2.5 months, he came to visit me. He stayed at a hotel and we had two super lovely dates. He took me out to dinner and bought me some books (I remember thinking it was so thoughtful since I\u2019m a big reader). We had a kiss and that was it. \n\nWhen he got back to Iraq he was texting me daily and we were making plans to see each other again. He said we could meet in Istanbul, showed me some hotels, etc. Then suddenly the communication tapered off, the reading stopped. I chalked it up to distance between us and didn\u2019t think much of it. Of course I was very disappointed as I felt like this guy really got me, like he saw me and heard me and genuinely. I was confused as to what happened.\n\nFast-forward seven months and I get a long message from him on Facebook telling me that he\u2019s sorry he fell out of touch, was having a hard time, feeling depressed, drinking too much and stressed in general and that he hoped he didn\u2019t lose me as a friend. He\u2019s a humanitarian aid worker, so it seemed legit given the situation he was in that he could fall into those feelings. I told him he didn\u2019t lose me and he resumed the daily contact we had had before. \n\nHe made a plan to come and visit me for 8 days but kept pushing it back. It should have been beginning of October 2018 but it was actually end of November into December.  Fine, no big deal. I didn\u2019t think much of it because of his line of work. \n\nHe comes and stays with me for 8 days. It was wonderful, we had a lovely time in my city, he met a few of my friends (who all liked him a lot). We even flew to another city to have dinner; how romantic is that? The sex was mind-blowing and frequent, like three to four times per day. He seemed like a machine. Red flags I noticed but brushed off:\n\n1. He was frequently on his phone texting with his female boss at all hours of the day and night.\n\n2. He would do this thing that I\u2019ve never ever encountered before. Any time we would be getting out of a car, taxi or private, he would just walk off without looking back. He wouldn\u2019t look to see if I was out of the taxi, or if I had caught up with him, leaving me to scramble and run to catch up with him. \n\n3. After he left, he had to go to Beirut to wait for his visa. I sent him a message saying that I really liked him and I\u2019d like to date only him. He wrote back saying \u2018yes let\u2019s have this conversation but can it wait until after the weekend?\u2019 Which made no sense to me as he was in Beirut, not working. He was partying a lot, drinking and doing drugs with \u2018friends\u2019 that he never mentioned again. 5 days passed without having \u2018the conversation.\u2019 My stomach was in knots the whole time, something felt off. I decided to tell him that I wanted to date him and if he didn\u2019t want to try this and see where it goes, that\u2019s ok but I wanted to stop having contact. He immediately writes back and says that he does want a relationship (it was so long and telling me about his past traumas) but wanted to wait until he was \u2018back in Europe\u2019 so he could \u2018properly\u2019 be with me. My stomach was again in knots but I accepted it. At Christmas, after being with his parents in Switzerland (I was in the US with my family) he went back to Beirut for what seemed like non-stop partying. I was uncomfortable. He was doing a lot of drugs and drinking and hanging out with people he had never mentioned before. On New Years Day he sent me a photo of himself from a bed that was not the bed he had been staying in the whole time. He was clearly still off his tits on MDMA. I ignored it. My friends in the US were telling me that all this behavior (there was more than what I\u2019m writing) was squirrelly and they didn\u2019t like what was going on. I made excuses. \n\nHe came back for the three weeks in February and we had the most amazing vacation. It felt like when I first met my ex-husband, who I was mostly very happy with for 7 years. I was super in love and  said he was too. He met my friends, stayed at my apartment and we took a road trip around Europe and went to super-romantic Bergamo. We were both all-in. I didn\u2019t notice a lot of drinking.\n\nThe only red flags during that trip:\n\n1. He was frequently on his phone talking to female colleagues.\n\n2. I noticed that he would cross the street without warning, sometimes leaving me on the other side of the road. I asked him about it, and about how he walked away from cars without looking back. I told him I\u2019d never seen it before and that usually people look back and wait for the person/people they\u2019re with. He chuckled and asking jokingly if I was calling him a sociopath. \n\nWhen he went back to work in Iraq, he started to seem a little disengaged and I started feeling a bit anxious because he would hang out with all these female friends he has (he has like 10 'close' female friends). I've never had a partner with so many opposite-sex friends, I didn't know how to handle it and I probably came off very insecure, because I was.\n\nI told him that I was feeling anxious, so he invited me to Iraq. Bought me a ticket for my birthday. Set up a trip to federal Iraq, which involved me literally being smuggled into Iraq with no visa, mingling with ex-terrorists and Shia militias. I was blown away by the generosity and his knowledge of what I enjoy (I\u2019m a conflict photographer). \n\nI should mention that on March 4th, before I left for Iraq, he called me drunk for the first time ever. He was slurring his words and I was trying to talk to him because I was trying to deal with Turkish Airlines over the phone about my ticket, there was a problem with his credit card. it took me a long time, minutes, to realize that he was drunk.\n\nHe wasn't listening to me at all, he was just slurring speech at me and at one point he stopped talking and was silent. Then I said 'are you still there?\" and the said \"what? what? what the fuck? DId you just call me a piece of shit?\" I was stunned. I tried to tell him that I didn't actually say anything at all, nevermind call him a piece of shit. Then he said \"ok, maybe I was mistaken. but you DEFINITELY called me an alcoholic the other day.\" I ended up getting off the phone with him. The next day I got a very apologetic phone call. He said that he felt triggered because I asked him what he was up to, because his ex was so abusive and didn't trust him (news to me). He then begged me to still come to Iraq so he could prove that this was an aberration, and it would never happen again. He also said he was so happy to be in a healthy relationship where issues could be resolved practically and without drama. I agreed and got ready to leave for Iraq. \n\nin Iraq: The day before I was supposed to leave for Mosul, I found a pair of underwear in his room on the desk chair. It was folded, clean, with a pair of socks and a microfiber hair towel. I of course called him about it because my heart sank, and he told me they probably belonged to his friend Nick's fiance, because they stayed in his apartment while he was away with me in Europe, which I already knew about so I was satisfied with the answer. No big deal. He gets home a few hours later and I was sleeping. He got into bed and hugged me so tight was was like 'I was SO afraid to come home. My ex was abusive and she would have been screaming and throwing things at me! I was freaking out all day at work, so I have to take a Xanax. Yeah I was like, thinking through ALL of my one-night stands trying to figure out who they belong to.' \n\nso of course I pull away and I was like, wtf babe? He's like, no, before December. They were all drunken flings. no big deal.\n\nIt made me feel uneasy and like he was trying to get a reaction out of me. The fact that he sleeps around so much when he's single and drunk made me feel unsafe. I ignored that burning in my stomach that told me he was lying. I mean, I knew the underwear were Nick's fiance's, but he had a weird look on his face when he told me about the hookups.\n\nthis devolved into a conversation where he told me that I needed to know that he would never stop working abroad and we would always be long-distance. I thought about breaking up with him and I told him so, and then left for a meeting with a fixer. When I got back to the apartment he was crying saying he didn't want to lose me. It felt like a show, but I knew he was under a lot of pressure at work so I let it go.\n\nThen I was back home in Europe, and he was just being weird and distant sometimes, and even doing things like picking up his phone and texting people while I was talking to him on video skype on the computer. frequently going out and getting drunk, disappearing for hours on end. He would also frequently text me very sweet things, and he read to me over whatsapp. It was lovely and distracted me from the other behavior. I felt so loved, heard, seen and appreciated for the first time in so long, but at the same time, I had this buzz in my stomach telling me something was wrong. \n\nWhen I was in Iraq the first time, we planned a trip to Croatia with his roommate Annie, who seemed nice enough and didn't seem threatening. She seemed to genuinely like me. Before the second time I went to Iraq a the beginning of April, he told me that Annie asked him to ask me to not come for the third week of the trip, so they could have two solid weeks alone together. I was furious an hurt and spent the better part of a Saturday night arguing with him, crying and trying to illustrate to him why this was not ok to do, and not ok for Annie to ask him to do. I had to give examples like \"would you ever ask Annie to ask her partner not to come on an already paid-for and planned vacation?\" Like, I had to explain normal behavior to a grown man.\n\nSo he promised that he realized that it wasn't ok, and he would tell Annie that I was still going on the vacation. The next morning he called and said he had changed his mind and he actually did not want me to come. I told him that it was already paid for, and I was going regardless. I would stay somewhere else but I would not give up this vacation. So that was that.\n\nRight before the second time I went to Iraq, he told me that he actually wanted me to be with him in Croatia of course because we were starting our life together with him being out of Iraq (he was taking a six month sabbatical). Naturally I was super pleased to read that. He said he would 'fix' things with Annie.\n\nSo I arrive in Iraq and Annie, who is 36, acts like a total asshole to me. She also paraded around in her bra and underwear and told me several times that she found my partner to be gross and she would never want to sleep with him. It was so  weird. Shakespearean, almost. The lady doth protest too much. \nI also met all his female friends who were all gorgeous. Totally intimidating, because they were all quite young and I'm feeling insecure about my age and the way I look. \n\nthat week we went to the mountains on the border of Iran. We stayed in a resort, it was super beautiful. While we were there, two nights, He drank 6 beers and a 2-liter bottle of vodka. He was absolutely wasted. We had small arguments but it was pointless because he was drunk. At one point I told him that I had accidentally left his birthday present at home to which he replied \"my home in Iraq  or our home in Amsterdam?\" I felt relieved. I don't know why I didn't put that in the same category as \"stupid shit he says when he's drunk.\" I guess I just wanted to believe that he felt that way. I didn't say anything and left Iraq without further incident.\n\nSo I'm getting ready for a birthday trip to The Middle East with my friends  and the anxiety just will not let up. It was almost debilitating. I was constantly checking my phone to see what time it was. I was waiting for something but I didn't know what. Probably texts from my partner, because at that point, they had become like crack. My dopamine was flowing each time.\n\nOn the trip, I was totally absent. Ilse, my girlfriends said it was like I was physically present but not there. I so wanted to enjoy that time but I really didn't. I just wanted to go home. 6 days into the trip, my partner told me he was going into the mountains with his friends to get drunk and do drugs. It made me uncomfortable. We ended up having an argument. I packed up and drove the girls 5 hours to Jordan.\n\nI didn't hear from my partner all day while we were in Petra, which was unusual. When he finally messaged, he was distant and I asked him if he was ok. he said he was feeling bad and full of self-loathing. He also told me that he has no empathy or emotions. I didn't know how to respond. Later in the day, we arrived at the Bubble hotel and it was gorgeous. The girls were getting ready to go to a Bedouin tent for some traditional food or whatever, but I had to stay behind because I was on the phone with my partner. He tried to break up with me. I was so distraught that i couldn't stop crying, and then he was like, ok, ok, I'm sorry. Let's not break up. Then I felt relieved. Only the could I continue the trip.\n\nI knew that his birthday party and going away parties would be coming up and I was anxious about them. He's told me that the parties in Iraq get out of control and turn into drug-fueled sex parties. I didn't say a word. In the days following, I just asked him how the parties went and he was vague and just said they were ok.\n\nWhile all of the aforementioned stuff was happening, it was more hot and cold, push and pull behavior which was really painful. I made extra sure that I stayed consistent in my feelings and what I was saying because I knew he was starting to have a burn out from work. He also called me a few more times while drunk, one time doing nothing but yelling into the phone \"yeah so what, I went out, who cares.\" over and over and over while I sat on the other end of the line, speechless. All I had said to him was \"hello\" and he launched into it. \n\nAnother time he called me drunk saying that he drinks heavily in Iraq and when he drinks, he likes to fight with me. He also reminded me that he is dead inside and has no empathy. I hung up.\n\nAll except for that very first time he called drunk, my partner  blamed me for the calls and said that I knew better than to talk to him when he was drunk. It was my fault. He was full of self-loathing and maybe we should just break up. Same story each time. I was crushed each time.\n\nSo, fast-forward to Croatia. Everything seems normal in the airbnb with Annie, except that she ignores me, literally, until my partner arrived 5 hours later. Then everything was fine. a few days went by and it was just like very quiet and kind of awkward. One night, because My partner had been on his phone for an inordinate amount of time talking to his female friends for like three days, I asked him if we could take walk. I told him that I felt threatened by his bond with Annie and I was upset that he was spending so much time on his phone. He explained to me calmly that his female friends are like his sisters, like army buddies because they had been through so much together. Then he was like, your jealousy is really freaking me out and maybe this isn't going to work. Of course I panicked and just acquiesced to whatever he wanted. I did tell him though that Annie mad me uncomfortable because she was constantly sitting next to him, had to be right beside him all the time. He admitted that they had developed an unhealthy coping mechanism but I didn't have to worry. \n\nWe go back to the apartment and sit down on the L-shaped couch. I sat down on one side and David plopped down on the other side and promptly took out his phone. Then Annie comes over and sits right next to him and says \"hey D, it's almost like we're the couple! hahaha!\" \nI saw the panic on my partner\u2019s face and he pulled my arm to get me to sit next to him, but I pulled away and went to take a shower. I must have showered for 30 minutes. When I got out, Annie was in her room and my partner was in ours. He was reading. I walked in and he said \"hey babe, how was your shower?\" super nonchalant. I was like, are you kidding me? what just happened? And he was like what? nothing happened, it was just a joke! It didn't happen the way you think it did. I was like, are you saying that my reality doesn't exist? (I should mention at this point that he had told Annie about a month before that he thought that I was threatened by their emotional bond. I still don't know why he told me that.) So basically Annie knew how I felt, and continued to behave totally inappropriately, and made that remark that was obviously designed to hurt and make me insecure. I was gutted, my partner continued to dismiss my feelings and question why I was so upset over this 'joke.'\n\nI also need to mention that at this point, my period was like 10 weeks late. I was freaked out about it but figured it was fine because I never miss a pill. Ever. I take them with all my other meds in the morning like clockwork. Everyone assured me that it was probably all the stress, periods do that sometimes, disappear during stress.\n\nSo we're having sex in Croatia and I start to bleed, but like, really bleed a lot. And the blood was bright red. It also felt different than period blood. It felt thin and diluted. It was weird. My partner was like, yay you got your period! I said that it didn't feel right. Something felt off.\n\nI went home to Amsterdam and made an appointment with the doc who sent me to the gyno. The doctor tested my urine after i told her about the bleeding incident. It was positive. I had had a miscarriage.\n\nThe gyno did an ultrasound and there was still tissue in my uterus that needed to be expelled, I asked if it could wait until my partner was around and she said no because it could get infected. So I had to take one of those chemical abortion pills to expel the contents of my uterus. I was alone and my young son was at school. I called my partner who was on the road to Bosnia. He didn't pick up so I called Annie who argued with me about whether or not it was urgent enough for her to wake my partner up and interrupt her lunch. He was apparently sleeping in the car.\n\nHe called me back, I told him what happened and he seemed sympathetic. Then he said 'do you want me to come there now? (it;s a one-hour flight that only costs $100). I was like, do you want to come here? He said \"nobody wants to interrupt their vacation for something like this.\"\n\nwe talked for about another 45 minutes during which time he said he was feeling anxious and attacked, and said that I was yelling at him. I was really only crying. He said he had to go and continue the drive. 5 hours later, he sent me photos of all the fun things they did along the way. (he later apologized for being so insensitive).\n\nThe next day he called me in the morning. At this point, I was already wondering where my self-respect had gone and why I tolerated the behavior. Partner said that he hadn't yet bought a ticket (24 hours later) but if he did, he would come and take care of me but then we would have to have a talk about 'us' because he just can't take this kind of pressure. At this point, our whole summer is planned out through September and paid for. Thailand for the whole month of August. He's been saying to me this whole time how excited he is to start our life together. Telling me every day how much he loves me and how beautiful I am. Every. Single. Day. It started to feel a little disingenuous. So he's covertly threatening to break up with me. I panic and beg him not to. The cycle continues and I go back to Croatia as scheduled. \n\nHe continues to make remarks about all the things we will be doing this summer. Making plans. Saying he's excited to see my friends again. He bought concert tickets and we went to Belgium. The trip was a disaster. I was feeling a bit shit about the miscarriage and I laid on the bed and told him I wasn't feeling great (I still haven't talked to him about the miscarriage because he said he couldn't handle any more stress at this point, so I've kept it in) and I told him why and instead of comforting me, or even moving from where he stood, he looked confused and said that he had to call Annie in ten minutes. He was going to go to the lobby to do it. i started to cry and went into the bathroom and took yet another long shower to ruminate over what the fuck was going on. When I got out, he was in bed and said he was sorry that he misplaced his priorities and that he was just stressed. And had no empathy, and hated himself. Same story again.\n\nEarlier, On the drive to Belgium, I heard from my friend that his mother unexpectedly died in Australia and he couldn't get a flight out for another day. I told David and he seemed super sympathetic and offered to forgo the concerts to go home and comfort my friend. It was a sweet offer but my friend  already had company. So during the whole torturous evening that i just mentioned, he also says to me, to impress upon me that he truly had no empathy, \"when your friend called and said his mother died, I was just being polite to you. I really don't care at all about your friend or his mother, I was just worried about how it would impact you because that would impact me.\" I cried myself to sleep.\n\nAt this point he's back at my apartment in Amsterdam, my son is home and they seem to be getting along. Son took him to the playground because he was proud that Partner used to be a semi-professional player in Singapore and wanted to show off to his friends. Partner played soccer with all of them for like three days in a row. Things seem good. We're cooking together, watching movies, reading. Making all kinds of plans. Talking about getting me a job in the Middle East  to get me out of Amsterdam. I was excited. My photos from Iraq were getting attention from international papers. I felt good. Things were flowing. Then on Friday, he says he wants to break up. He hates Holland and doesn't want to live here. He doesn't even want to come back here in between our numerous trips. I cry and beg and plead. He relents. I agree that he doesn't have to come back here in between trips. We're back together. He leaves the next morning to see his parents in Zurich. I was supposed to leave for Zurich in a couple of days time, but I told him that I felt uncomfortable and insecure because of the break-up. He again begs me, literally, to come. He wants to rebuild my trust in him. He wants to show me a great week and show me that I can trust him and that he will never break up with me again. I arrive in Zurich, and through the week things are awkward, we hang out with his parents. He says we should try counseling because he doesn't want to lose what we have. He suggests that we become registered partners before he goes back to work in the fall. And if that works, a couple of years later we should get married. Not in an excited way, more like in a way to satisfy me.\n\nI was supposed to go back to Zurich for the third week of the trip, and then his parents would leave (they're moving back to Canada) and we would go meet my cousin in Italy. That was the plan. Then he asked me not to come so Annie can come and spend time with him and his family. I was like, what the fuck Partner, are you serious? But i let it go. I asked him to ask Annie to not stay for as long as she planned (7 days in a tiny apartment in an intimate family setting). He told me he would do that. So instead of coming in the morning of the 17th, she would arrive on the 19th late in the evening and leave earlier than planned. Only two days. I agree.\n\nI left Zurich with lots of I love yous, and promises from his parents to come and visit. They invited me to Courtenay, which is the town they're moving to in Canada.\n\nPartner basically disappears for two days, only sending short texts. One morning I talk to him and he's like, babe I have to go we're going for a hike and it's a two hour drive. I can hear his parents talking to someone in the background. It's the 17th. I let it go.\n\nOn the 19th, he starts messaging me again like he normally does. He cc's me on an email to set up the therapy appointment and also the email to the boxing trainer that he has set himself up with in Amsterdam. Things are going smoothly but I still feel anxious, like something isn't right. Then I see it. In my FB feed comes a photo of Partner and Annie together with Partner\u2019s parents on the 17th. He lied to me. I called him on the phone and further degraded myself by not getting upset about the lie, just begging him to talk about it in our therapy session the following week. Instead, he says \u2018this isn\u2019t working. I love you and I\u2019ll miss you. I\u2019m hanging up now.\u2019 I was absolutely destroyed. All of the plans we had. The things he had scheduled that very day. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. \n\n\nThe whole time, since he was in Bosnia, something had been bothering me. He keeps talking about the 'incredible and awesome' tour guide they had in Bosnia. He becomes friends with her on Facebook. She's like 25 years old. It was weird and made me uncomfortable. I didn't say anything.\n\nAlso, he seemed to only have one male friend. \n\nAnother strange thing is that during the last two weeks of our relationship he would talk to me with contempt and indignation. Constantly defensive. Acting as if being with me was some arduous labor he had to endure. \n\nHe would also stare at me a lot, it was as if he was staring through me. He would do it so often and for so long that I would get really uncomfortable. \n\nIn the last weeks, his sex drive went from overdrive to almost nothing. \n\nCan you guys give me some insight? Am I crazy here? I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not a picnic to be with 24/7 but this has really thrown me into a tailspin.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It has been hell.\n\nI have to live with them still, and we (my mother and I) have to take the abuse he gives us. Every single day, he blames us for something he went through (how the hell are all these things OUR fault to begin with), and yells some more about more things that I don't really pay attention to. But he likes to direct his anger to us because we are his safety punching bags. He's one of those MANY man-pussies who is afraid of getting a bad reputation out in his social gatherings (he's a oh-so gentlemanly, sweet, and intelligent CEO and knows a lot of important people BLEGH).\n\nJust now, he broke into my room with an umbrella and beat me after strangling me and pulling my hair right before throwing me onto the ground.

I even had trouble getting through college because of rumors created by these \"friends\" (I'm looking at you, Nelly). I got a good grade, but what's the use if people choose to villainize you? I need help and I have no one to help me. Even my mom just sides with my father now to spare herself from being yelled at some more.

I had to explain the reasons why I see it like that for the last few weeks. Shes done everything to convince me that it's a bad idea. She sends me every article there is about strengthening the relationship. And in most of these articles I see that it's a lost cause. \n\nIt's lost mostly due to lack of trust. I now know that any opening before a narc will be used in a nasty way in the worst moment. She proved that many times. Especially any emotional opening, or connected with my family will be attacked. So I don't share that. I mostly don't share anything relevant. I try to hide as much as I can. Meaning any new friends, experiences, books. It's impossible to go to therapy with someone you don't trust. And of course she won't accept anything non-symmetrical so if she shares her plans I need to share mine. Of course she sometimes forgets to share her plans, etc. You know the drill. The rules apply only to me. So what that she cheated on me. Now I should share my phone, exact schedule, and such. It's all so bizarre. \n\nBut even though I realize all that, it's still so freaking hard to move on. My family will criticize this, and probably will cut me off to some degree when the divorce is final due to religious reasons. Our common friends will mostly do the same, and they are influenced by her. The ones that see through her behavior are long gone from our circles. There are some new people that I try to protect for myself, but they don't care that much. \n\nI'm so drained. She's now seems quite confident that I will not leave her, I guess mostly due to my loss of confidence and lower energy levels.\n\nThere is just no closure with these monsters.

I respond to some posts here and there and thankfully this group has really confirmed I'm not crazy which is good.  \n\nThis is a very basic post, the same old rules don't apply, but I've had a change of heart for the better and I just want to share.  I'm not afraid anymore of the consequences of saying no or not doing everything asked of me.\n\nWe separated about a year ago.  I had enough and it got worse when I had enough.  Typical covert narc stuff, nothing physical just really heavy emotional abuse, guilt, shame, being used and so on, but I made it work for a long time.\n\nWe finally went through mediation signed a legal document which was great, hard but great.  Now my nex wants me to do things on their terms not the terms of the document.  I said no.  Well, that set of a firestorm and basically I'm being gaslighted into thinking that I don't know what the agreement was but I'm very clear on it and will not break it, as it's what we agreed to.\n\nSo, prior to this I was suffering with very conflicting thoughts after a month of NC, not about my nex but my life and the fact it's totally changed and I was being very hard on myself.  Like totally down in the dumps over the whole thing.  Then this happened this week and it really showed me I'm thankful for getting out because it reminded me of what I dealt with and ignored for so long and I'm free of that no matter the price emotionally or financially.   The behavior really shows the true colors and all the control and manipulation that my nex needs.  I can see it's like a drug to them and I cannot unsee the abuse now that my eyes are wide open to it.  They need to break all the rules and control things and hate any rules or contracts.  I'm the bad person for adhering to a legal contract in their eyes because I won't give anymore. \n\nI feel like I have yet unlocked another level and moving on in life.

At first hearing the story I did not understand why she was letting him stay. After seeing his dark side I know why. she was scared.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI start to catch on that this guy is just going to his car, drinking, because he does not have keys to her apartment. and he would reek like weed every time he returned. He would than come back and verbally harass the victim for stupid stuff, they would both disappear and come back. Him drunker every time, but he would still put on a face to people to try to fit in. And her always in tears.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI caught wind that this guy is abusive from someone that knows this girl. she pointed out the bruises to me (they were massive, I can't believe I did not see them) anyways she comes back in sunglasses, clearly has been crying but she regains herself and started to have fun swimming. this guy did not like her having fun apparently, were at the pool. My son is their in a chair (he's 5) and pool had only sun bathers. I call my wife to come get our son because this guy is doing this right in the open.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hear a yell from the distance ( profanity ) and its him screaming her name and storming toward the pool gates. he's out for blood. as he approaches the gate 3 women went behind a table and I stood in front of it. The gates pretty heavy and he has no key. He tried to blame her for \"making him drive drunk\" despite him irate that he could not find his keys, as crazy as that sounds. (still kinda think someone hid them) we offered to buy him an uber in an attempt to cool him down before he got to the only gate entrance. It pissed him off more.  He eventually Forced the gate open breaking the latch  and is now in a rush to get at the women behind the table. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWithout any hesitation I thought to myself if I get him into the pool. he's going to have a heck of a time getting out as intoxicated and high as he was. allowing everyone to get out of the gate that he is blocking.  Ive never shoved something or someone so hard in my life. In fact he landed in the middle of the pool between ladders. His phone sank to the bottom. Ive now got 100 % of his attention and anger on me. The women being abused is livid with me \"He's now going to kill me !\" She is yelling over and over distraught and crying, but the girls and other patrons take the opportunity get out before he does.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe gets out in a sprint yelling he was going to kill me heading straight for me. Im a big guy 300 lbs 6.3 and had a considerable advantage in hight on him. I stood blocking that gate as he is yelling at them over the fence every curse word so loud that neighbors are out on their balcony telling us to shutup. The girls took the opportunity to call the police, and im with him watching him pace until they show up. He gets so upset that he starts taking his phone and hitting himself as hard as he could in the face. I was relieved when I had seen 2 officers show up, he changed his demeanor instantly and put his hands in the air walking toward them. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where the story unfortunately falls flat making me think I should have handled things differently. I found out today that the police just drove him home after being fairly certain he would be arrested. The problem... she did not want to give her side of the story in fear of losing her child in an unrelated divorce. Now this guy is loose with the police effectively enabling his behavior, and I feel guilt as I may have put her (and her child, not his) in future jeopardy. I tried telling her that she needs to press charges, but im not sure she will. I Cant get it off my mind. Everyone won't stop telling me I did the right thing, but I cant stop thinking of the real victim here being her and how I only stopped just one of the many incidents that day.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Living with NE has me on edge, stressed 24/7 and shes a good reprieve from the daily grind. My NE joins in the pool and brings out some beers. I think it's important to note that NE and I have been best friends since we were in middle school, he is diagnosed NPD and I knew that going into a relationship with him - spending time together comes easily BUT i would say 7/10 times hanging out together turns to some sort of disagreement or him being a hurtful person in some way shape or form. All of that being said, he and I living together sometimes forces situations like these where he will include himself in my plans, but never the other way around. \n\nBack to it - K comes over and NE comes out to include himself in the fun. Everyone is getting along, fucking around and splashing about in the pool. Things begin to turn focus when NE starts being openly flirtatious with K. Shes pretty drunk by this point and isnt playing into any advances from him but for the sake of me and my feelings isnt being rude or aggressive towards him. I see what's happened and at first, I'll admit it hurts to watch. I was feeling jealousy swell in my stomach before I reminded myself that I shouldn't feel jealous, but rather, disrespected. So I took it in stride, floated around the pool a bit and interacted with K mostly. But it sat in my stomach. \n\nI had to drive K home in her car so I had NE follow me so I could get back home. Once in the car, he asked me \"what's your attitude tonight?\" I said, \"I dont have an attitude\". I knew where this was headed and the argument is played out, I dont want to constantly explain myself when it doesnt matter anyways? Were broken up now? He said \"this is exactly why we cant work it out. You get angry and dont talk about anything\". This is not true, I was the only one in our relationship to try to talk about things, but if he didnt want to talk or was done with the conversation, it would end... because hes in control of everything. I replied \" I just got to feeling a little insecure when you were flirting with K all night, I felt disrespected.\" There was a few seconds of silence until He said \"maybe if you werent such a bitch all the time, I'd want to flirt with you too\". \n\nAnd it sort of felt like I was slapped in the face? \nI asked him why he would say that and he said \"because its true.\" \n\nLol fair enough. I cried everyday for almost 3 months because of him, because he degrades me and makes me feel like I was un-wantable.  \n\nNarcs are such a silent killer. They quietly and subtly break you down without you even realizing it, until it's not quiet and subtle anymore... they're just tearing you down and making you feel like less of a person.. \n\nWhat kind of person listens to you say they've made you insecure and in return says something so heinous to make you question your worth and second guess if you're the problem? \n\nNot being in love with him is terrifying... because now all I see is how manipulative and abusive he is.

Months later when the completely unexpected fight broke out I was devastated - I had poured every ounce of my soul into being a better person to the point that even she admitted things had been going well in our relationship.

I keep going back to documentation of the relationship and making edits of things I remember that have happened. I may end up posting the whole thing at some point. Please excuse any typing mistakes.\n\nTS= the spouse\n\nWhat had sparked me to type this out was due to a few incidents that happened this year. It started this year with my grandmother dying. My mother was severely upset when this happened as were the rest of the family that was close to her. On one evening TS began to state that they didn\u2019t understand why my mother was so upset as my mother had previous issues with how she was raised by my grandmother. I told TS that it was still her mother regardless of what had happened previously. TS then began to berate the actions of my mother and stress that all my mother did was complain about my grandmother. This upset me and I told TS that I did not appreciate them talking that way about my mother. TS states that it\u2019s true though and that my mother shouldn\u2019t be grieving the way she is. I retorted back at TS that she could grieve how she wanted and that again I don\u2019t appreciate that TS was talking \u201ccrap,\u201d about my mother. TS states that they are not, but TS clearly was. I was in tears because of this as it was close to the day my grandmother had passed and was still highly emotional. The conversation ended with me going to the bedroom to get away. I begin to close myself off emotionally to TS slightly. As an edit, when the day had happened I was to take my child to a therapy session and asked TS to call and cancel the appointment. I did not want to be sitting in a waiting room crying. TS did call and told them that all I would be doing is crying in the waiting room. TS was upset I wanted to cancel the appointment.\n\nIn another month TS became upset when I had wanted to pay a bill that was in my name, I had been working on my credit and did not want this bill to reflect poorly. TS became upset about this and said that their credit was bad. I had asked if they had checked it recently and was told \u201cNo, I already know that it\u2019s bad.\u201d I told TS that they should check anyway, and it may not be as bad as they think. TS again said no. I said I had been working on mine. TS then retorts angrily that I should just go move in with my mom and fix my credit and that their credit was bad already and there was nothing they could do. I told TS we could attempt to work on it and TS again said no. I don\u2019t remember how the \u201cconversation\u201d ended. This had made me feel bad that I was working on getting my credit better. I don\u2019t have a lot of control over the finances of the home and haven\u2019t in awhile. TS has access to my bank account, but I don\u2019t have access to theirs. I have no idea how much money they have in there at anytime.\n\nClose to the end of Spring TS and I had a discussion. TS was talking about how they don\u2019t like their job and how they are going to quit. I try to be consoling and tell them I understand I\u2019ve been there before. I've worked a similar job in the past. TS tells me that I couldn\u2019t do their job and that I would quit. I tell TS I wouldn\u2019t, I\u2019ve never backed down from physical labor. The comment hurt though, as it felt as though TS was belittling me. From what I can tell that\u2019s what had started it into an argument. TS is yelling and I\u2019m speaking with a raised voice. TS states a few times, \u201cWhy are we even together?\u201d I don't respond to the comment. During this argument TS acknowledges that I\u2019ve closed myself off and am not as loving. TS accuses me of cheating, which I'm not. I ask TS if they want to know why I have been a bit distant and TS tells me they don\u2019t care. I end up blurting it out anyway. I don\u2019t remember how the argument ended. I begin cleaning everyday to blow off steam and keep my mind off of being hurt. Everything gets washed and cleaned by me everyday. \n\nWe end up going to a renaissance faire as a family. We dress up, which is something we had never done before. I was informed by my sister that the faire was still hiring. Given our situation I applied and got the job as a part-time gig for extra money on the day we went. I didn\u2019t work that day though and would start the next day. As we travel the faire TS then states that I\u2019m not watching our kid and becomes mad. He wasn\u2019t doing anything out of the ordinary and was clearly in view. TS goes next to him leaving me with the items we have in a wagon. I then proceed to get next to him to keep an eye on him. I usually am the one who is walking with him when we go out and keeping an eye on him. I wasn\u2019t sure what he was doing that would warrant him needing such close supervision that day. He's almost a teenager. He eventually is ready to go and TS agrees, though they are still upset. As we are about to exit my son and I are asked by TS if we are going to get our hands stamped to reenter. Our child is ready to go for the day and did not want to walk around anymore. This clearly upsets TS. We get to the car and are taking the extra parts of our costumes off to drive home. TS is fuming and speaking tersely. When we get in the car TS begins to yell that they thought we were going to go back in and that this whole day was supposed to be for their birthday. I am feeling upset because I was not aware that this was supposed to be for TS\u2019 birthday and was assuming it was just a family day. We had gone several weeks after TS' birthday had already passed. With TS yelling at me escalating my mood to being done with the day. I ask TS if they had eaten and TS says that haven\u2019t. I get some food out of the cooler and give it to them before we leave. I begin driving home and TS is still yelling slightly and eating. I focus on the road and do not say anything. TS eventually calms down but is still upset we left. TS apologizes saying they just needed to eat, but still says that the day was supposed to be for their birthday.\n\nI am now working everyday. I work my regular job through the week and work at the faire on the weekends. At the faire I work 10 hours a day and am outside the entire time near a hot stove. I love working out there. The people are great. One day during the week I did not cook. TS said nothing to this at first. I then go to the kitchen to make me a snack. When I sit down at the table, TS is sitting in the recliner, TS gets up and goes to the kitchen. They are moving things around in an aggressive manner. I ask TS if everything is ok. TS tells me it is; it\u2019s clearly not. I again ask if everything is ok. TS then says that they are mad that I didn\u2019t not make them anything to eat but I can make myself something. I get angry and tell TS that they can have my snack I made for me. We are both aggressive in this argument. TS again says, \u201cWhy are we even together?\u201d I again don't acknowledge the comment. I don\u2019t back down in the argument and argue as profusely as TS. It eventually ends with TS being angry and going to bed. I can\u2019t figure out in my head why I\u2019m getting yelled at for not cooking a meal even though I had worked that day too. TS had not cooked any meals for a couple of months or so and there was no agreement that I would cook everyday as TS is out of work at a reasonable time to assist ever so often. At this point I have closed myself off even more.\n\nThe day before Mother\u2019s Day I arrive home from working at the faire. It was a good but odd day. I change and walk back to the dining room. I begin to tell TS how my day was, I was hit on few times by guys and thought it was cute, so I relate this to TS. TS becomes upset saying that I did not ask them how their day was and that I just automatically started talking about my day, and that not one person close to them, their family, my family or I have not told them Happy Mother\u2019s Day. I explain that it\u2019s not till the next day and I\u2019m told that was not the point. They say that no one had even gotten them anything. I go to my child\u2019s room to grab a card I had gotten for TS to be presented to them on Mother\u2019s Day and that even though I had to work at the faire on mother\u2019s day I had planned something. I\u2019m told, \u201cYou just bought this.\u201d I tell TS that I had because I have not had the money to buy a card before and had used the tip money I had gotten that day to buy it. TS does not want to see the card. The argument ends with TS saying, \u201cWhy are we even together?\u201d and me meekly replying \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I\u2019m feeling completely broken. The next day I wake up early and cook breakfast. I present it to TS in bed and then leave for work that day.\n\nWhere I\u2019m at and other things\n\nAt that point I close myself off and stop showing outward affection to TS. Any affection is reactionary. I don\u2019t want to be hurt anymore. TS has noticed this and occasionally would ask a question that I would blow off with basic comments. TS is now to the point of off and on trying to love on me more than they ever have in this whole relationship. I am still reactionary. TS has not attempted to argue with me or belittle me since I\u2019ve closed myself off. I am done and I don\u2019t want to do this anymore. I can say that I do get enjoyment from talking with my close friends and am not in a major depressive mood. \n\nThe main reasons I haven\u2019t said anything is because, being a male, I fear losing my child in a custody battle and I don\u2019t want a large emotional argument with TS when the time comes. I fear they would do something crazy because of this talk I want to do. I also don\u2019t know how changing the living situation would work, as we had just signed a new lease on our apartment. I have been building a support system around me with a few close people who have seen this relationship for a while. I had been asked several times by these same people throughout the relationship why am I staying with TS. I never had a good answer and would always give a BS reason. I know if I have this discussion with TS it would seem to them as though it is coming out of nowhere, and that I\u2019m kicking them while they are down, but it\u2019s not. I don\u2019t want to attempt counseling with TS, I just want to be done with this. I am trying to find the courage to move along.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

One of my colleagues who is also a good friend informed me that he came into work on Tuesday and \"seemed to be looking for me\". Me and said friend are both cashiers in a large supermarket. I served my Nex's brother earlier on today and braced myself for the inevitable and lo and behold- I was right! \n\nIt is quite a peculiar feeling having the person you thought about 24/7 for months on end and tore your heart out over standing right in front of you attempting to initiate a conversation. He told me that \"he heard I was around\". (Well yeah, I do work there!). And was wondering how I was considering it was \"coming up to August\", (August will be one year since I had a termination that he forced me into) and then proceeded to ask \"and how are you?\". It took ***everything*** I had not to laugh! I don't know if I am more amused that he is so predictable or offended that he genuinely believes that I am still so naive as to buy into his bullshit. I didn't even respond to him asking me how I was. \n\nHe then asked me \"do you still hate me that much?\", I responded with \"75p please\", (he came in right out of his way to buy one bottle of water and ask me how I am as he is seemingly so concerned). I guess I am sharing this as proof to everyone who may be struggling to believe that it does get better, that it really does with time. I didn't miss him in the slightest and actually, the only thoughts that were crossing my mind during the entirety of the interaction was, Does he really think I am ***that*** stupid?! And What the ***hell*** did I ever see in him?!\n\nI am not even suprised that he had the nerve to come into my place of work and ask me how I am after everything he has done, typical Narc behaviour. I had been hoping that I was lucky enough not to recieve a hoover but it happened and I am very proud with how I handled it. \n\nI am actually glad this has happened as it has proven to me how far I have actually came in the last 13 months, I looked him in the eye and felt pretty much nothing. The trauma bond is officially broken and I now know with 100% certainty that he is a Narcissist and that none of it was my fault. \n\nSo anyone believing that it will never get better and the pain will never ease- it does, and one day you will look at your Nex straight in the eyes and feel absolutely nothing. And it feels ***AMAZING!***\n\nAlso his card declined for the water, lol.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

For as long as I can remember, she has had two versions of herself that I could never understand were the same person and still don't- the one who calls me her \"best friend\", loves me more than anything in the world, and protects me. And then there was the hateful, demonic, terrifying version of her.  \nI have tried everything over the past 18 years- ignoring her when she is angry, going along with whatever she says, even yelling back at her. But nothing works, and I'm at the point where I'm at the end of my rope when it comes to dealing with the pain.  \nAmong many things, she has called me on multiple occasion everything in the book (bitch, cow, and asshole are her favorites), saying she hates me/wishes she never had me, making fun of my father leaving me at six weeks old (\"cunt your dad doesn't want\", \"mistake your dad helped me make\"), and mocking me when I cry. Upon cooling down, she acts as if nothing ever happened, and if I say it hurts me she says I'm too sensitive or I'm overdramatic. This happens every time she's angry with me, occuring at least once or twice a week. These situations usually arise out of her thinking my hair looks messy, me taking up for my grandparents when she fights with them, or me accidentally saying something she didn't want me to say to other people or forgetting something. She has said these things to me for as long as I can remember, even as a small child. She typically does not get physical with me, but I remember her on occasion when I was younger slamming me against walls, smacking me, grabbing my arm- hard, and if I tried to curl up in a ball to avoid her she would kick me. When I try to leave the room, she screams at me to not leave and says I have to sit with her.  \nI don't understand; she's very nice and polite to other people, and people always tell me how charismatic she is. The only people she lashes out at as well are her parents. It kills me because I truly don't want to be angry with her or cut off ties with her when I go to college- she's a wonderful person when she's not angry, but that hurts me even more when she turns around and does these things. I feel like others have it much worse than me, so I feel like I am being dramatic if I do wonder if it's abuse. Anyone have advice on lessening the pain or dealing with this?

It went exactly as I knew it would.", "author": "cyclamatesaccharin", "self_text": "Context: Very traumatic discard about 6 weeks ago. Kicked me out of my flat before dawn after a twisted cycle of future faking and devaluation. Had to come back to my parents' (3 hours away) with what was left of my life in a suitcase. I sent somebody else to pick up my stuff. Still trauma bonded. \n\nYesterday, he came to my town with the lamest excuse ever. He brought me a broken-ass suitcase (seriously, the look on my face when I discovered that that was for me. He got so angry when I told him that that was not acceptable, lol)  with some crap I had been perfectly fine without (blankets?!). I agreed to see him because I had to hand him the keys and a written authorization so that he could go and deposit them back on my behalf. However, now I realise that I could have just mailed them and spared me the headache (hindsight is 20/20, but still), but I guess that, in a sense, it was good that it happened.\n\nI don't know if it was a proper hoover, because he did not ask for me to come back. Actually, he looked pretty smug about having discarded me. He said he had done it \"for me\", because he actually knows best (i.e. he thinks I don't really want to have kids. Paternalistic bullshit at its finest). \n\nI did the worst thing I could have done. I confronted him and ended up losing it. I told him that I'd rather he raped me, because at least I would have known how to deal with that (I've been there before... way too many times). I handed him the list of fucked up events that I had written for myself to remember because he asked for it so that he could \"work on it in therapy\". I told him to just say it out loud: that the real reason he had discarded me was that I was no longer a good supply. I told him that by going to therapy he's just getting a massage, since he's not talking about my feelings but his, and he's not only not being held accountable but also being fed lies about himself. He was in denial, sarcastic, making snide remarks and just treating me as if I was resentful or spiteful that he had discarded me. That's what he came for, after all: he wanted to see me beg for his love (again). But, even though he did see me cry, I didn't. \n\nYou know what made him cry? Hearing what my therapist says about him (that he's hopeless and I should run for the hills and never look back). I guess that having a skilled professional see through his bullshit was kind the poke in his narcissistic wound.\n\nNeedless to say, I didn't get the closure I desperately wanted. However, even though the whole ordeal was traumatic as fuck, I got a confirmation of the diagnosis, and the prognosis looks extremely grim. He's rotten to the core. The look on his face (you know the one)... he's just broken inside. He does know what he's doing, but he can't stop. I think of his next victim(s), and the kids he might have with them, and my heart aches so much for them. It's truly a tragedy.\n\nI just want the cognitive dissonance to end. Every time I think of him as a normal person, as the person I thought he was when we first met, it's like a knife twisting inside my chest. But, hey. It's all in my head (literally; trauma bonding is a hell of a drug). I can do this. We all can. \n\nMeanwhile, I had two job interviews last week -- and I had to choose: even while having to cope with all of the trauma, on top of my insecurities, nerves, and lack of self-esteem, I fucking aced them. Both places wanted me to work for them! This time I'm going to work with very little kids (teaching), which I've never done before. And I'm going to pour my heart and my soul into it. Because I'm the most loving, nurturing person this bastard has ever had the luck to come across. And finally, I have the opportunity to put it all to good use.\n\nAgain, if you've made it this far, thank you for reading. And remember: don't waste your time confronting these fuckheads. Focus on yourself. Get out in the sunshine. Stop pouring all of your energy into an empty shell. Remember that all of this has been done to you because you are fucking awesome; drill it into your head and never let anyone else make you forget it. \n\n Much love to you all.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

For example, i would talk almost daily with this friend of mine on the phone and i swear i don't know if she's a covert narcissist but i feel like they're always giving backhanded compliments/sarcastic remarks that just make me feel bad about myself later on but i kind of just laugh it off during that moment they say it and doesn't hit me until later nor do i get a chance to call them out for it. Maybe i'm being too sensitive but this one time I was trying to give advice to them because they stopped being friends with some people and i told them to try to keep busy and to try not to focus on them so much and focus on yourself (i guess this was shitty advice to say cus i could feel that after they were just passive agressive about their response and behavior). Then they started to say \"yes, i should just keep busy who cares i just lost two friends\" and then said \"wow psychology\" (because i'm a psychology major i felt that they were dissing me this way). and when i tried to apologize and said that they don't have to take my advice because i could clearly see why they were upset they denied it and went to go get water and the phone conversation ended there.\n\nAnother example would be when I offered to invite them someplace to eat and started describing some of the food items they had and then they were like \"wow you're so cultured\" but again in a very sarcastic tone. Maybe i'm being unreasonable but there were many other tiny instances like this but it's all adding up and making me very frustrated now that i don't know if this person will end up being a toxic friend in the end and should i keep my distance? The thing is that this friend also contacts me quite frequently to vent/talk about her personal issues so idk \n\nI also feel like since they're not the type to directly confront me if they have some sort of personal issue with me that this relationship i have with them feels kind of disingenuous because there would also be times where they also shower me with compliments and can nice and caring but i still feel apprehensive around them and on guard when their other side will come out.\n\nAm i being crazy for thinking that my friend is trying to insult me on purpose or do you think it was unintentional on their part?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I did not know who this man was that came to my house. He was totally different and distant. I said my piece, gave him a hug, and he said goodbye all robotic and monotone. His hands were shaking as he handed me the keys. I had never seen him shake to that degree. I asked him, \"what the F is wrong with your fingers?\" He said, \"I don't know.\"\n\nI was completely in love with this facade. Our relationship was perfect.

I have scars of where he would burn me with a lighter (a smiley) when he didn't get his way.. I tell people that I did them to myself because I don't want people to know that he hurt me that badly.

I remember Sir's body on mine as he would brutally rape me. I remember the nights that Sir would tie me up and rape me all night long. Never giving me a break, because as soon as he came, he would shove some kind of bottle into me and force it in and out of me while he had to 'recharge'. \n\nI remember the nights where he would take a riding crop (a type of whip for horses) and beat me until my back was bruised. He would whip me for hours, his penis down my throat to keep me from yelling.

Then a month later, he discarded me in a very dramatic way after I refused to cancel a trip with friends last minute for his birthday.\n\nI could have cancelled it, but I always felt like he was trying to isolate me our entire relationship and it seemed like a boundary I shouldn't drop. If he really loved me like he kept saying he did, he would understand and respect that- or at least find a compromise. Also- despite his pushing, I had not agreed to be his girlfriend again. I loved him, but I wasn't going to jump back in without a serious discussion and therapy. \n\nThen he discarded me in a very cruel and sudden way as punsishment, and it's been more permanent than any previous discard. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't know why this one hurts so much more than any of the ones before. I knew it was coming. Maybe because this time he actually means it? Maybe because in February he at least seemed to acknowledge on some level that he knew I cared about him?\n\nOver the past month since the discard, I've reached out to him a couple times in week moments. He's messaged me a few times too, so it wasn't out of nowhere, but he's not the one pushing this time. He tells me \"I hope you know you have hell to look forward to when you die\" and \"fuck you you fucking suck\" and \"this is harassment, I'm calling the cops\" when he texted me the day before and we had a normal conversation.\n\nI hate that he hates me. I feel like me caring about him makes me the crazy one, because I know he doesn't give a shit. And I really do still care about him. He says his problems were because of me, but I know they really weren't- he would scream at me things that didn't even make sense or happen, and say things like \"I have a more superior imagination than anyone you'll ever meet in your life, so you not texting me back for three hours is abusive.\"\n\nWhich I know is nuts. I dunno, if I didn't get a text back for a few hours when I wasn't sure what was going on one day, I might get  anxious about it, but I would be fine if we had a quick conversation about it later and I was reassured. I wouldn't scream insults at them, threaten a break up, and then give them the silent treatment for two weeks. \n\nI don't know, I guess I always felt like my motives made sense because I was fighting for communication, while he was frequently just instant emotional reactions and then fighting to punish me for them if they were negative.\n\nBut now I'm still stuck in the \"desperately wanting communication feeling.\" I want him to know that he is loved, that he is safe, that he is talented, and that everything is okay. I feel like if I knew he was dating someone else or had really moved on, I would have room to feel pissed at how he treated me and move on myself.\n\nBut he's not doing that, he's burying himself in work, in his apartment that's become a two bedroom trash pile due to his depression, and doubling down and deliberately feeding his feelings of hating me.\n\nAnd I can't stop thinking about it. He didn't treat his other exes this way, and he always said they never cared or listened to him like I did. Which I know could easily be a lie, but why me? Why am I the one he has to insist he hates and hopes rots in hell? Why can't he just leave knowing I cared about him? I wouldn't have put myself through the hospital stuff for any other reason.

I was trapped with a narcissist man for 8 years. \n\nFor years I struggled with my addiction of narcissistic men. Relationship after relationship I fell into the same trap, and would end up with another egotistical, self-loving and heartless man. \n\nSadly, I haven\u2019t had anyone to teach me how to handle these guys.

He expected me to constantly admire him, and to practically worship him, even when he was being pig-headed and arrogant. \n\nI remember so many times through the relationship wanting to physically hurt him, just so he could get a taste of the pain that he had caused me. \n\nAnd then, one day, I\u2019ve reached the tipping point of my exile. \n\nThat was the the day of our 8th anniversary. I clearly remember everything like it was yesterday. \n\nWe went to a dinner, mechanically. All the time he was bragging about his successes, like usual. I got used to it. \n\nThen we went home and he said he needs to finish some urgent work. I went to my bed. \n\nI woke up in the middle of the night, and sneaked to the living room. He was sitting at the computer. I recognized that he is on a dating site OkCupid. I went back to my bed without him noticing anything. \n\nIn the morning, I went to see the computer history and it was all erased. I tried to log in to OkCupid and succeeded. He was careless enough to use the same password as for our home computer. \n\nI started reading his Inbox and almost collapsed. He\u2019s been flirting with dozens of women. They were exchanging hot pictures, and he even scheduled dates with some of them. \n\nThat was the day I took my destiny into my own hands. I left him without ever mentioning what I\u2019ve found. \n\nI felt relief, but after couple of days I also became worried about the future.

I\u2019ve done research and it looks like it could be narcissistic abuse- but I\u2019d like to get some outside opinions.\nIt was 9 months long. \nSo in March he lost his job. He told me they fired him because they didn\u2019t have anyone to train him. He cried when he found out and id never seen him cry before. So he was jobless for a month. I redid his resume, helped him look, but he\u2019d turn things down because they didn\u2019t \u201cpay enough\u201d \u2014 mind you, he doesn\u2019t have a college education and hasn\u2019t held one single job down longer than 6 months.\nHe mentioned his buddy in another state had a job that paid really well (manual labor) and he may have to go there and work a little bit to make up money. I said we\u2019d talk about it when we get there if we get to that point, he agreed.\nSo time goes by, he doesn\u2019t take any offers.\nOut of the blue, this same buddy buys him a concert ticket. So he goes- he manages to find a ride as well. I told him it might not be a good idea since he doesn\u2019t really have any money to take care of himself while he\u2019s down there even though he has his way paid.\nBut he goes. He\u2019s drinking everyday. Says he doesn\u2019t have service which ends up being a lie (this is Jacksonville, FL we are talking about)\nAnd then I find out he\u2019s sharing the hotel room with his buddy and there\u2019s two girls staying there. He claims he had no idea. Throughout this whole relationship I always gave him the benefit of the doubt.\nThen things get weird.\nHe tells me not to worry about this one girl specifically. Yet she ends up being right next to him or in front of him in every single picture.\nThen he decided to stay another week without talking to me. He \u201capologized.\u201d\nHe promised to call me every night and keep me a part of it. He kept his promise for two days, then the communication stopped. Started becoming more and more cold. Then he started posting sketchy things... lots of drinking, being around girls.. the same girl still showing up, being so close to where bodies are touching every single time in every picture.\nOne day he goes the whole day without speaking to me (for no reason) and then sends me a Snapchat of him drinking and I didn\u2019t respond immediately because I didn\u2019t know what to say to him. Then he blew up at me and said \u201cok. Fine. Guess you\u2019re too busy.\u201d\nHe never apologized for that, or any of this, just made excuses and tried to throw it back on me. \nHe even told me I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\nHe broke up with me over a Snapchat message, saying we needed to take a step back. He deleted me, all of our pictures before we even broke up. All I asked is that we could talk but I was never given that opportunity. He told me he wanted to be that man for me but \u201cwasn\u2019t ready to address his problems/demons.\u201d So he decided to stay living in another state. By doing this he left behind his 1 year old son (not my child). So now the kid will have to grow up with an absent father. Later I find out he\u2019s dating the girl he told me not to worry about not even two weeks after being broken up, he was keeping rent money from his old roommate and lying to everyone about it, and now he\u2019s trying to buy a newer car??\nI never saw this coming. He gave me a promise ring and we were supposed to move in together this month. Even his parents said I deserve better.\nI will say.. and this is something I was scared to share before.. my self esteem is in recovery.\nHe used to make comments ALL the time about other women about like \u201cshe\u2019s got a fat a**\u201d or what he\u2019d like to do to them in front of me. I\u2019d addressed it once, he stopped for a while but then picked it back up and told me I was too sensitive. He told me I worry too much. He would give me the silent treatment \u2014 so much so I\u2019d cry and he\u2019d ignore me. He has a string of broken relationships. Bad credit because of his financial history. I also learned he was buying used women\u2019s underwear from the internet..\nBut when it was good, it was amazing. Flowers on my desk at work, sex was amazing, he sat with me through anxiety attacks.. said he wanted to marry me. I\u2019d never had a relationship this long or a connection like this before. He told me I love you very early on. \nNow To this. And I don\u2019t know who he is anymore. I don\u2019t get how he moved on so fast.. \nCan anyone help me make sense of this?

I knew he wasn't treating me how I deserved but he would always argue and say that he loved me and that I was the problem. There were so many red flags and after reading through posts in here, I can see why I was manipulated into staying with him and why I stayed so long. You don't realize all the crap they put you through sometimes until after you finally break it off.\n\n\\- One year into dating, he told me I would have \"one more chance\" to fix myself and get a better job. This happened multiple times obviously, as we stayed together for five years and he never broke it off. Just had this threat hanging over my head the entire time that he was going to leave me, so I was constantly anxious and worried that he was going to dump me because I wasn't good enough.\n\n\\- He tried to get me into his line of work (IT tech support) instead of my own job (vet assistant training to be vet tech). My parents were both veterinarians and I work for my mom at her animal hospital. Obviously I'm going to want to work with animals. BUT he was allergic to animals so I wasn't allowed to do what I wanted because it inconvenienced him when I had cat/dog fur on me.\n\n\\- We broke up multiple times during our relationship. Over very petty things. First time was after a friend's wedding and I wanted to go home, not to the after-party, because my feet hurt and it was late and I was tired. No, that was unreasonable. He drove us back home SO FAST that I was crying because I thought we would get into an accident. We got to his place and he demanded I take all my stuff and leave, because we were over. Stupid me begged and cried for him to not leave me. Another time I accidentally drove his car in the wrong gear for a few miles (I told him multiple times I did NOT want to drive his car but he forced me to). Then I got a very small tattoo to remember a kitten I had to have euthanized for heart failure that I had been very attached to. This was a HUGE fight. HUGE. I should have walked away, but I didn't. He always kept me feeling like I was being strung along, like I NEEDED him. But he would always act like he didn't need me. He would tell me to never talk to him again and block me on everything. I would try and try to contact  him, but he would ignore me. Then, after a few days, he would break contact and beg for me to talk to him. But I had to apologize, because everything was MY fault.\n\n\\- He was really shitty to his family, especially when they were doing well. If anything went well in their lives, he got grumpy and passive aggressive. I had to ask him multiple times to apologize to his mother because I couldn't believe the way he was speaking to her sometimes.\n\n\\- When we fought, he would give me the silent treatment. I would ask all the time \"What's wrong? What did I do? Just tell me what I did so we can talk about it!\" but he would ignore me or just act like he was fine, then BLOW UP at the end of the day right before bed. Then wanted to have sex because we were \"over it.\" \n\n\\- This was a constant issue - we would be in bed sleeping and then randomly in the middle of the night, he would want to have sex. I wouldn't, but he would pout and be REALLY REALLY REALLY pissy if I said no. So I would have to roll over and deal with it. Then (even though I clearly wasn't into it) he would complain in the morning that I just \"laid there and did nothing for him\" afterwards. This was probably the most hurtful thing he did to me. I couldn't even have control over my own body and what went into it some nights.\n\n\\- One Thanksgiving, we were at his sister's restaurant for dinner, and he was in a good mood, and looked at me all sweet, and said, \"I think you're 'the one.'\" This was before I realized what an ass-hat he was and I was all \"awww\" and \"oh that's so sweet.\" A couple of years later, I brought that comment up and he said, \"What? When did I say that?\"\n\n\\- I think around year 4 was when I really realized what an asshole I was dating. He started saying \"there's someone else waiting out there for me.\" I would get upset and he would act like what he said wasn't a big deal.\n\n\\- He was very controlling and opinionated about my hair and my clothing. I have the side of my head shaved and love to dye my hair fun colors (pink, purple, blue, etc.). This didn't really fit in with his view of the world. I also have several tattoos. He happened to hate tattoos and basically told me that while we were together, I couldn't get any more tattoos because they meant I was trashy and a whore. I love comfy, 'hippy' kind of clothing, and floral prints and cute things. According to him, floral prints made me look like a grandma. My comfy clothes made me look like a bum. You know what he wanted me to dress in? PENCIL SKIRTS AND HIGH HEELS. He would tell me that he was trying to fatten me up, (I was 5'6\" and around 115 lbs at the time) but then said if I got fat, he would leave me. Thanks bud.\n\n\\- He hated when I spent any time with my one male coworker. My coworker was admittedly my best friend at work, he understood my issues and listened to me and cared about me. I stupidly told my nex that my coworker had a crush on me, but you know what my nex did? He acted all high and mighty and said \"that guy is a loser, I'm not worried about him.\" \n\n(well... he should have been, cuz that guy and I are getting married next June haha!)\n\n\\- My nex literally thought he was like the best human being on the planet. He could do no wrong. He was so much smarter than everyone. So much better. Everyone else was an idiot, including me. But that was okay, he could deal with how stupid I was because he liked the sex. He especially looked down on waiters for some reason?? Like any issue with the food, he would blame on them, and then give them a shit tip. He FORCED me to give a waitress at my favorite restaurant a ONE DOLLAR TIP! This guy complained about fricking everything. Going out with him was an embarrassment and always stressed me out, because how would I know if he was going to make a scene or not?\n\n\\- When I FINALLY got the guts to leave him, he FLIPPED THE FRICK OUT. I broke up with him over the phone because I was literally too afraid to see him and thought that I would give in again and stay. So he was pissed about that. He actually told me that he had to think of a reason that he and I broke up and that I had to look like the bad guy because he couldn't just tell his family that we \"broke up.\" He said there had to be a reason. I told him that was a really shitty thing to do but he could do it if he wanted to, if that would help. He kept telling me over and over that I was a terrible person and that I was so shitty. Then GUESS WHAT!! After all this name calling, he begged for me to stay with him. I had to hold strong and tell him no probably a hundred times. Then he asked if we could be 'friends with benefits.' This asshole seriously was with me just for the sex, I really think so.\n\nTo anyone who read through this whole thing and shares any of these red flags, I hope you realize your situation sooner than I did and get OUT of it. I wish I hadn't even started dating this douche. I have so many insecurities and issues lingering from this crap relationship. But... like I mentioned, I'm in an amazing, perfect relationship with my literal soulmate and I'm getting married to him next year! Things DO get better!!!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

But nooo lol\n\nFirst she got upset at me saying that I was judging her character and that she thought we were friends and that she doesn\u2019t remember bullying me. I really didn\u2019t expect the conversation to go this way and I tried to be as nice as possible in order to get the answer I wanted. I wasn\u2019t judging shit because I made it clear that I thought the bullying was my fault and i wanted to know what I did (this is before I started emdr and realized no matter what, one deserves to be bullied) but essentially she was upset and told me that kids are assholes and she\u2019s not responsible for how she behaved as a kid and that she doesn\u2019t know what I think I\u2019m entitled to and all that.\n\nI tried to meet her half way and said that maybe she didn\u2019t mean it or maybe what she thought was having fun was bullying and that I don\u2019t hold anything against her. I made sure not to use the word bullying either I just specifically listed the main things they did to me and let her come to that conclusion on her own. I said in quote \u201ceveryone\u2019s different so even though there are no ill intentions some people may still be hurt by your actions\u201d.\n\nShe then responded a few texts later JUST like this \u201c\u201ceveryone\u2019s different so even though there are no ill intentions some people may still be hurt by your actions\u201d\u201d in response to me saying that she shouldnt take me confronting her as a personal attack. It was the most immature thing I\u2019ve seen in a while. This came from a 21 year old.\n\nI told her my social anxiety and ptsd developed around that event and as a result of it and she says she has no choice to be upset if someone is blaming her for their psychological damage. But I just saw it as telling her how she treated me and what the result of it was.\n\nTo me it seems like she hasn\u2019t really changed. Her kids are assholes bit was bullshit because I didn\u2019t bully anyone at that time.

She even read parts of my dairy out loud to my aunts and my sister, and beat me until my aunt had to physically force her to stop. I was so upset, I was literally sobbing and I said that she didnt love me because of how she was treating me. That made her even more upset so she physically threw me out of the house and said she was calling DFCS to pick me up since I wasn\u2019t happy at home. She didn\u2019t actually do it though. Her response to me writing about suicide was that if I did that I was going straight to hell. She didn\u2019t even try to see why I felt the way I did.\n\nThe next day my aunt forced me to apologize to her and I did. She never apologized back nor did she really accept my apology, but I know she feels bad for what she did. Our relationship was never truly the same afterwords.\n\nThis experience was very hard for me to deal with and it\u2019s made it almost impossible for me to open up to people and express myself. Please share any advice on how I can move past this or similar experiences", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Advice needed", "author": "effybeanz", "self_text": "Hi everyone, \n\nSo I've unfortunately been dealing with the effects of sexual trauma since I was a child. It was reinforced badly 10 years ago, and I spent the ages of 21-29 in the darkest places I've ever been. I went back to treatment in 2018 for my eating disorder and I've actually been doing relatively well, even with losing my mom earlier this year. \n\nUntil this week. The details are pretty mild I guess? But please don't read on if there's a chance it will trigger you. Also, apologies that it's kind of long, because I'm REALLY bad at being concise and succinct, especially when I'm this distressed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a sleep study done, and I think the technician I had was completely inappropriate.\n\nBasically, he was overly touch-y from the start. Before I had even changed into my PJs, he was touching my arm, hand, knee, while talking to me. When I did change, his hands were on my shoulders in a very familiar touching manner multiple times, he touched my knees while he was attaching the electrodes to my legs (I still feel sick thinking about his hands sliding over my shoulders and knees). He changed the location of one of the EKG electrodes multiple times and I was trying to move my breast/shirt myself but he was pretty much going in for himself and brushed my nipple in a way that made me want to run screaming. \n\nAt this point he thanked me and said \"A lot of women are so uptight about that\" , then he said he was done hooking me up, slapped my hip near my ass and said \"sexy!\".  He also, all night,  called me \"babe\" \"sweetie\" and other pet names that I never want anyone but my boyfriend calling me. \n\nI had to get up at one point and when I got back into the bed, some wires got messed up. He got angry with me and yanked me up by my arm, which messed me up pretty badly because angry men is my biggest trigger. \n\nI had mentioned to my boyfriend in a text before going to bed that the tech was being very touchy feeley and making me uncomfortable. \n\n I've had countless EKG's done in the history of my eating disorder, and NEVER have I been made to feel that uncomfortable- and they have about 3 times as many things to hook up on my chest than he did! The touching my legs, shoulders, the \"sexy\" remark- I keep going over it and saying, he was just being friendly. He was joking about the sexy thing because I was hooked up to wires and he'd taped my face to death. But it still made me feel like crying? \n\nMy therapist has made it very clear that even if his intentions WERE 100% pure and he had no idea what he was doing, the fact remains that my feelings about it are valid. He was aware I had a history of trauma as we discussed some of my sleep problems (PTSD nightmares and hallucinations). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI genuinely feel like this man was doing this as a power thing. He made me so uncomfortable from the start, he was alone in the room with me with the door closed the entire time he was hooking me up, he was clear that he hates his job. I don't think it was sexual in the typical sense, but in the sense that he had 100% control over the situation and knew it, and the more he pushed (the arm touching, then the shoulders, then the knees, etc) and I allowed, the more he did. Which is often what sexual predators get off on in the first place. \n\nI've already decided I'm cancelling my follow up to get my study results. I want nothing to do with that office after that, especially since I would have to go back to the exact location for the follow up appointment. I don't know who to call within the office to make a formal complaint, because their website is empty. They're affiliated with a local hospital, so maybe call patient rep there? I've also found the form to file a complaint through my state's dept of medicine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs reporting him being too dramatic? Am \\*I\\* being too dramatic? My boyfriend was over last night and I had to stop him multiple times during intimacy just to have him explicitly remind me that it was him touching me. My PTSD over the emotional and sexually abusive past I have hasn't been this bad in a long time.  But I'm also afraid I'm just blowing things out of proportion. Medical professionals do a lot worse to people, and maybe he really didn't mean to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then, his demeanor changed dramatically the next morning when more staff was there. So maybe he did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you got this far, and are able, I would love any advice. This may be cross posted, I've never joined any abuse or trauma subs before because I was doing so much better but this has me really messed up. I've already started using eating disordered behaviors again and I don't like where this is headed for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks again, and sorry again for the essay here.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I also apologize for any grammatical errors since I'm typing this on my phone.\n\nI was diagnosed with both depression and anxiety about five years ago. A psychologist I had been seeing said it potentially started as far back as the ages 6-8. \n\nMy childhood sucked: I lived in a rural town in the middle of nowhere, I was bullied by practically every kid two to three years above and below me in the k-12 school I attended, and my parents and extended family had an inordinate amount of expectations placed on me because I was a \"gifted child\" (a term I still hate to this day).\n\nI spent my whole life wishing I was normal. I wasn't asking for a lot, even just a couple friends would've been nice. \n\nNear the end of high school i started going out with my ex. She was pretty quiet but she seemed nice and I thought we hit it off. The first year was pretty good but as time wore on things progressively got uglier. \n\nShe became increasingly demanding of my time. I made a bunch of friends in university but I had to isolate myself from them as per her demands. I had to give up sports and even study less to make enough time to satisfy her craving for attention. She would blow up my phone if I forgot to call her and would hold it against me for days. \n\nShe would berate me. It wasn't a common occurrence at first. As time wore on it became more frequent up until it was part of her daily routine. Some of the highlights of this were: calling me worthless regularly, telling me I didn't do anything right regardless of what it was, questioning my manhood when I wouldn't argue with her, berating my family and telling me I'm awful because I have some of those traits, etc.\n\nShe tried to isolate me from my family as well. My family and I had a rocky relationship because of the pressure they put on me and she took full advantage of that fact to drive a wedge between us. Everything bad in my life, even things she caused, were the fault of my mother and father. \n\nThe worst form of emotional abuse was her false claims that I sexually assaulted her. Which she used against me as leverage for years. I did no such thing but she regretted losing her virginity so much that she said I sexually assaulted her to get rid of her guilt. She admitted this to me herself in an argument. \n\nThere were only two instances of physical abuse. Once she slapped me repeatedly in an argument, the other I was hit with a frying pan. \n\nThe transition from a normal relationship to abuse was so subtle I didn't realize I was in an abusive relationship until about three years in. It probably sounds like an excuse but my self image was already so damaged from my past that I had become dependent on her. Her abuse only worsened the problem and I was scared to death of leaving.\n\nI stayed up until almost six years. \n\nDuring the time I was with her I developed an eating disorder and gained 156lbs in just six years. I became extremely unhealthy and unattractive compared to what I formerly was and i accept that, I'm not in denial about it. \n\nI still hate myself despite having a good network of friends and family. I lie and pretend to be happy go lucky when I hate nearly every aspect of my life from the way i look, where i live, my career, etc. I don't want to worry anybody. \n\nEven after all of that I'm too depressed and apathetic to give a fuck about any of it. I'm not suicidal or self harming unless you count becoming morbidly obese. I'll repeatedly lose 40-60lbs only to gain it back because I stop caring.\n\nI know only I can change myself but I just don't care anymore.\n\nI'm tired and lonely.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

{"post_id": "cfzwej", "created_utc": 1563721283, "title": "Stay strong", "author": "FaintedGhost23", "self_text": "Hi everyone!\n\nThis is probably going to be my last post on this subreddit, and I just wanted to wish you all good luck with recovering from the abuse if you haven't yet. I'll write something here about my own recovery, maybe it'll motivate you. \n\nA bit more than half a year ago, I didn't know what to do. My ex-girlfriend had broken up with me a few weeks before that, and my mind, and body, weren't okay at all. Even during the 1,5 years LDR relationship, I lost kilogrammes every month, I barely went outside, didn't spend a lot of time with friends, family,... and didn't pay any attention to their advice. \n\nAfter the breakup, I was an ever bigger mess. I didn't see a future for myself anymore, didn't care about myself at all anymore (if I even did before that) and had suicidal thoughts. Luckily, those never came to effect further than sitting on the edge of a balcony, before returning back to my room. \n\nAfter those few weeks, I finally realised the relationship was toxic, and that I was a big mess, but that it could still be helped. I did my research on toxic relationships and finally found what I was going through: narcissistic abuse. After watching what seemed like 100 videos on the topic, I knew enough to talk to others about it. \n\nI'm a very big introvert, though. I have issues with talking to people I don't know, and didn't have anyone in my family I could talk about this with. Therapists were an option, but the one I went to during my relationship didn't help at all, and was basically a big waste of the money I couldn't afford to waste, so at that point I was a bit done with therapists. So as a sort of last resort, I went to Reddit, and I found this subreddit!\n\nThe amount of support, advice and friendship I've found on here has been amazing. Reading stories and talking with people going through the same things helped me in an indescribable way. Quick note about that: if you would want to talk about it, you can always let me know, I'm always here to help, though I'm not a professional. \n\nDuring the first few months, I still wasn't okay. I still had contact with my nex now and then. I couldn't let her go, and she liked nothing more than keeping me entangled. I even entertained the thought of getting back together! God, I even told her that, and she said she needed time to think about it. By now, she's been thinking about it for, what, 5 months or so? Either way, what I mean to say by this, is: don't wait for them. Don't even entertain the thought of getting back together, because all you'll get is more hurting, more abuse, and more issues. \n\nThis might be totally irrelevant, but a good song I listen to to remind me of the narc abuse is Lie by NF, or Dead Inside by Muse. Thought it might help, who knows?\n\nI think the reason most people stick with their narcs is because they think that, as long as they do what the narcs want, they will eventually change. And that's what I thought too. After the first few months together, my ex changed drastically, and I always thought that, as long as I did enough effort to make her happy, she'd change back to the old her, the girl I loved. That obviously never happened, so please, try not to think like that if you are. Narcs NEVER change, but you can. Your feelings for them, the issues, the hurting,... all of it can. And the key to that is yourself.\n\nSlowly, I started recovering. I gained about 10 kilogrammes, started going to gym, and found a teeny tiny bit of happiness. Not much, but it was a start! Of course I still had my sad and bad moments, where I could wish for nothing more than to be back with my nex, and sometimes, I couldn't deal with it any longer and texted her. Of course most conversations ended with her hurting me mentally, making me feel sorry for doing nothing wrong or worse. Even more, I was disappointed in myself. Disappointed that I gave in to my stupid wishes, that would only slow down my recovery.\n\nA big change in my recovery were the new friends I made and my girlfriend! I could always talk with them about what happened, and especially my girlfriend have taught me that I, and everyone, do deserve love, affection, respect, and especially wishes. We're allowed to have our needs and standards, it's the most normal thing in the world, and you should never, ever let them down. \n\nSo please, stay strong if you're not through this already. I believe in you. It might take some time, but you WILL get through it, one way or another. You have a future, one without this narc, a future that is much, much brighter than the one you could ever have with this person. \n\nThanks for all the support, and for reading this. And again, I'm only 18, but I'm always willing to try and help, so let me know if I can do anything! Stay strong! \n\n~Emiel", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

They\u2019d just think you\u2019re the crazy ex who is having a difficult time moving on. In any case, I had a relapse the other day and momentarily checked the ex-narc\u2019s Instagram - there it was, him parading the predicted new supply, who seems to be happy during the initial stages of flirting.

I thought about my intention again and again - I\u2019m not doing this because I want to get back together with the ex-narc, nor am I doing this for vengeful reasons (I\u2019m not a vindictive person, and my support system keeps reminding me of that as well). I\u2019m doing this to save this other soul from going through the hell I went through.\n\nSo I set up an anonymous email account and sent cryptic yet very leading emails about how he should be cautious and guarded when it comes to matters of the heart. He responded with a brief thank you and acknowledgement that he will. He even posted it on Twitter, stating that it was creepy, but appreciated the concern. He also has a Curious Cat account linked to his Twitter, where anyone can ask anonymous questions with the user\u2019s responses tweeted. I submitted a couple of probing questions there about his views on relationships that are one-sided and abusive, and his responses were of an empath\u2019s - he believes that healthy relationships should be about compromise and give-and-take. It appears he was also in a toxic dating arrangement in the past, so that gives me some hope that he\u2019ll recognize the red flags with this narc. I knew then that his heart was in the right place and at least he can be rational about these things. I feel a bit relieved that I was able to plant that seed and he was receptive about it, though understandably skeptical since everything was anonymous. I also knew that the ex-narc would be able to read the new supply\u2019s Curious Cat responses, and hopefully be alerted and threatened that this smart new supply is actually rational and aware about narcissism in potential relationships.\n\nAll things considered, I know I should stop doing these things to fully heal and move forward. I just felt a certain level of responsibility to warn this new supply. Do I continue tipping him off anonymously, in the hopes that he sees through the illusion and perhaps turn down the narc before he gets caught in the web of abuse? Or do I leave them be at this point (because right now, I feel better knowing I already did a little something instead of just idly standing by) and really move forward with my life without the ex-narc and the new supply invading my thoughts?

Apologies that this is going to be a bit of a ramble.\n\n\nI have never been lovebombed or truly exposed to narcissism to its full extent before. I was so flattered, fell head over heels and we have had the best whirlwind romance. I dedicated my everything to him; financially, emotionally, physically. But now I look back, there have been red flags popping up for a long time that I chose to ignore.\n\n\nI told him about my stepdad sexually abusing me when I was younger, a secret I have kept from everyone all my life, and he has never supported me - only used the information as a threat, telling me he'll tell my mother, and as a means of manipulation/blackmail. \n\n\nHe used to live in a town out of the city, so I used to drive him and spend time with him there as I knew he didn't like it, to make it better for him and help him get in and out of the city. I never asked for fuel money, and he never offered.\n\n\nHe's drained my financial resources by totally taking advantage of my giving nature; when we went out for drinks the other night I bought a round and then when it was his turn he just held out his hand for my bank card in front of my friends. We went to do a grocery shop for his house, he added cigarettes (I don't smoke) and then said he'd \"forgot\" his wallet so I had to pay. This kind of thing happens routinely and adds up. \n\n\nWhen we went on holiday to Bristol, I paid for fuel, the hotel, the parking and everything. He got drunk and went ballistic at me because my ex sent me a meme, which I didn't even reply to. He also snooped through my phone on other occasions looking for messages from my ex. \n\n\nWe also went on holiday to Manchester, I lost my bank card so was having to use cash. I took \u00a3250 spending money, which was spent in the first day. He paid for things the next day as it was a Sunday and I couldn't get to the bank (which he totalled up to be around \u00a3420 that I owed him, including the cost of the hotel, and which I paid him back for, though he later said I didn't). I then took out another \u00a3300 which he took to \"look after\". When I asked for some at one point he lost it, shouting that it was \"our money\". Apparently there was nothing left over from it the next day. He also went crazy at me one time for forgetting to lend him \u00a350. \n\n\nHe stayed at my house while looking for a job for about a month and a half, was rude to my housemates and turned them against me, didn't contribute a penny for food or anything. To be honest, I loved him so much and was happy to have him there to the extent I looked past it. He questioned where my loyalties lie when I told him he was making my housemates dislike us both by being loud and smoking in the house.\n\n\nOnce, while he was staying at my house, my card got declined from the financial burden of supporting us both in terms of food and drinks. I was crying and upset, he told me in that case he was going over to his friends house now. That should have been the first indication of how easily he'd leave me if there was nothing left to take from me and to be honest was one of the first times I snapped at him. He obviously used that against me. \n\n\nFriends, family and housemates have all independently commented on how rude he is to me; talking over me, shh-ing me and constantly needing to be the centre of attention in conversation. I brushed these comments off at the time, but the more I think back perhaps he never respected me, and only wanted me around for his own image. \n\n\nHe even basically anally raped me the other day, I realise now it's because I am a commodity to him and not a human with feelings that he actually cares about. I'm there as a supply. A resource. We had a good sex life, he wasn't sexually frustrated. There was no need.\n\n\nMy mum paid for his flight and hotels to come away to a family wedding, he got absolutely blind drunk and was offensive, threatening and rude to my family members. They forgave him after one night, but he did the same thing the next day, so they had to ask him to leave. I was mortified. He also emptied a cup of tea over my head while I was lying in bed and spat at me, 3 times. \n\n\nThese are large scale examples but this behaviour is present at all levels, down to day-to-day stuff that I wouldn't even remember or note enough to spell out here. \n\n\nWhen we first got together and I learned he was married but separated, I thought nothing of it. Everyone has a history and I liked him. But he has lied to me about his communication with her; telling me he phoned her for support (because I'd gone to Brighton with a friend) then when I got angry as that was inappropriate he told me that he'd only said that for a reaction and that he didn't actually call her, they'd spoken because she'd called him to discuss the Visa/passport/marriage situation but that he'd \"told her about me\" and she was \"happy for him\". Months later, I'm assuming he'd forgotten he told me this as he informed me that she had messaged him saying she'd learned he was seeing someone new, so I knew he'd lied about his previous communication with her. When I called him out on it, he denied he'd ever said that he told her about me.\n\n\nHe has also met up with her to discuss Visa/passport/divorce stuff recently, but lied about where he was meeting her. I called him afterwards to find out what had gone on and asked if he could go somewhere alone to chat as he was drunk with a friend. He told me \"no\" and basically to f*ck off as I was being \"rude\" by trying to speak to him while he was with a friend. I was so hurt that he couldn't spend 5 minutes after meeting his ex to apparently discuss important things around his ability to stay in the country to talk with me about it, as he happily spends time on the phone to friends when in my company. He has also deleted messages and WhatsApp conversations from his ex. He sent her drunk messages in front of me asking what she was up to, then the next day said it was because I'd told him to and I think he's convinced himself that's true. \n\n\nI know he cheated on his ex, and he gets annoyed with me when I have brought this up as a way of trying to get through to him what narcissism is, what it looks like and why that behaviour makes me nervous. But she was also a resource. Financially secure and their marriage kept him in the country as he didn't have a UK passport, she walked out but agreed to stay married for as long as he needed to be able to stay in his own right. But he said I was different, that our relationship was different.\n\n\nI was so chilled about things with his ex at first and understood that they would have things to discuss, but these little lies have been so damaging to my trust that now I'm uncomfortable with it all as I never know what's true and what isn't, and he just says \"I thought you were different\" when I react. I even comforted him once when he was feeling anxious that she was in their old flat in case she found out about me. The cognitive dissonance of not recognising my feelings on this situation (and pretty much all situations) is directly the product of his actions. He completely trivialises these lies as well and has no awareness of how damaging they have been. \n\n\nAnd I've slowly become increasingly resentful and bitter and have found myself getting angry at him, just not myself at all. There's only so much a person can take. I try and try to get through to him but he just makes out I'm crazy. He will happily blatantly flirt with other girls right in front of me and has used my emotional reactions to make all our issues my fault, despite not realising it's triggered by how he's treated me, taken advantage and used me. I am fun, cheerful, generous and chilled out. Does he not remember how I used to be? I'm the kind of person my friends come to for advice. And those qualities have all become increasingly dimmed, and he just says things like \"why are you so angry all the time?\" or \"you're not very nice to me\". After treating me like that, what does he expect? He'd probably laugh with his friends if he knew I'd posted on a support group. \n\n\nSo after putting up with this sort of treatment for months, I'll get down to how I've ended up being discarded. I went out with a friend the other night and told my ex that I would come meet him afterwards. He was messaging me telling me he missed me and loved me and wanted me there, I said I would go after the concert I was at with my friend. When I called him a few hours later, he told me not to bother going, that he wasn't going to tell me where he was so I couldn't find him, that he was with someone else now, and wouldn't be going back to his that evening, then hung up on me. I called back loads, but he declined my calls. I had to stay on my friends sofa. I didn't hear from him again until midday the next day, despite calling and messaging. I said he had some explaining to do, and he just told me to go and collect my things from his and that we were over. When I got there, he was so cold. He wouldn't touch me, or kiss me, or explain. He had grip bruise marks all up his arm, apparently from wrestling with his friend. He watched me pack all my things up, crying and begging. He felt nothing. I asked him \"is this really happening?\" and he responded \"I just want you to leave.\" He said he was sad, but he just looked bored. \n\n\nI walked to the train station, and sat outside on the phone to my friend sobbing. I didn't want to get on the train as it's underground and I couldn't bear to be alone, I needed to be on the phone to my friend. Then I saw him walking towards me, my heart leapt because I thought he was coming after me, to tell me he loved me and he was sorry and wanted me. But he made eye contact with me, shrugged at me then walked right on by into the train station. \n\n\nI have put up with so much, made so many excuses, defended him and done so much for him. How has this happened?\n\n\nGod, it hurts so much. I'm so confused. I loved him desperately. He's consumed my life, I always knew he was a narcissist but was willing to overlook it - we all have flaws, myself included. I thought I could get through to him and we could be the couple we used to be. But leopards never change their spots. I never thought he could so callously discard me like this. I'll miss him so terribly. Or the person I thought he was, at least. It's such a strange psychology that the person I loved doesn't exist and was a fa\u00e7ade for the true person I saw underneath at the point of discard. It's almost like being catfished. That's why he has so many friends, he can rotate and bounce around lots of people so nobody sees what's underneath. \n\n\nThe more I read here the more I see how his behaviour exactly follows the classic stages everyone describes of a relationship with a narcissist; idealisation, devaluation and discardation. I'm just in shock it's happened to me.\n\n\nHe's recently got a new job and got his new flat sorted with a new (female) housemate moving in (both things made possible by me). His friends all live nearby. I guess he just doesn't need me anymore. He's in a much better place than when I met him. \n\n\nI always used to comfort him and help him when he was feeling low in his old job, he messaged me once that someone had made a comment that he could do better and I helped build him up and support him. He used to comment on how positive I was, how my perspective helped him and how I made everything better. He's just drained all of that from me. I guess I should be grateful that I have a chance to share that with someone else who will deserve it and appreciate it all more. \n\n\nHe's boasted to me about how he's never been affected by breakups. Now I know why. And I know there'll be a next girl. And I'll be the ex that treated him badly. I can't fix him. I tried. I'm not sure I'd even be jealous; his relationships will always just be a resource to drain from until there's nothing left to take, and they'll be discarded just the same as I was. Whether it's a few months in or years, it'll always happen. I couldn't have done more for this man or loved him harder. I'm broken right now. But I will be okay.\n\n\nSorry for this rambling post. It's longer than I intended. Thanks for reading.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He said this to me as if it was something to be proud of...like he was bragging to me. I got the impression that his mom was praising him for all these \"masks\" he wore.

He was mysterious and cool, physically everything I desired and I was desperate to meet him. But he kept making excuses not to meet me, for months, close to a year, with no real explanation but always throwing crumbs my way here and there so I never forgot about him. This made me even more interested obviously.\nNow him not wanting to meet was a clear sign that he wasn\u2019t all that interested, so a \u201cnormal\u201d person would\u2019ve just straight up told \u201csorry I\u2019m not interested, move on\u201d, but he never did.\nI would text him once or twice a week and sometimes got a sweet reply, sometimes something rude and condescending, sometimes no reply at all. This got me hooked, it was like a slot machine, I\u2019d get so high when he was kind and so low when he wasn\u2019t.\nFast forward a few months and we finally meet, and lo ne behold he\u2019s everything I thought he\u2019d be, devastatingly sexy, cool and charismatic and I fell hook line and sinker.\nWe saw eachother a few times for drinks and sex but I eventually realised all the things he said about liking me and wanting me to be part of his life was bullshit because he\u2019d never keep his promises, even small ones like he\u2019d call me later that day. It really felt like he broke promises on purpose just to hurt me. But why? For what? I never did anything bad to him.\nWhy couldn\u2019t he just tell me it was just sex and that he didn\u2019t like me all that much?\nI eventually got to a point where it hurt too much and I stopped all contact for 10 months (the heartbreak nearly killed me and he never hoovered). After 6 months or so I started dating again and was getting slowly but surely better emotionally, however he was on my mind each day and I\u2019d wonder if I\u2019d just expected too much and was wrong about him. \nIn April this year I broke no contact and he seemed pleased to hear from me, but his interest diminished after a couple of days and I would never hear from him unless I text first. I didn\u2019t contact him for 2 weeks and then got a text (first ever hoover) asking if I wanted to meet so I did. We had a great time and had sex and he told me everything I wanted to hear, only to ghost me again. This time I called him out on his bs by calling him a narc a psychopath and a sadist, telling him I knew he hurt me on purpose (he denied this). We met once more after this but I believe it was just for him to take revenge because I\u2019d figured him out. He used me for money and a place to stay, had sex with me then  ghosted me again. When I asked him why he told me he was sick of my shit and blocked me. Why do people do this to others? I just wish he\u2019d told me from the start that he wasn\u2019t into me.

You are talking over other victims and effectively silencing them. Let me tell you a little bit of my story.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI grew up with a person who had been my very best friend for eighteen years. We did everything together; we went to camp as children and loved hanging out at his house, watching movies, playing, the whole kid thing. I have many great, happy memories with this guy, and I love looking back and smiling about them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there are serious dark spots in my memory, things I don't like thinking about. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou see, while he was wonderful a great deal of the time, he could turn cruel in seconds. He was extremely sarcastic with me and not in the charming, 'Haha, you got me!' kind of way. No, I felt stupid and degraded whenever he snapped at me. I felt like I couldn't do anything right, and started to keep my opinions and life to myself as time passed. I never shared secrets with him; he'd told so many of them to other people and saw nothing wrong with what he'd done.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I talked about something I liked and he didn't, instead of just telling me that it wasn't his thing, he'd tell me just how stupid it was and call it trash.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRead through that. Now in a healthy friendship, all of that couldn't possibly be seen as abusive, right? But it's not that simple. His tone was always very critical, I couldn't share a single disagreeing opinion without him flipping out and all but yelling at me about it. He'd tell everyone that I was doing something 'bad' for even voicing some phrase I didn't like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe claimed that I was making a personal attack on him whenever I disagreed with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd when I finally couldn't take more, I tried to set a boundary with him and he completely lost it with me. I had asked for a break in the friendship; I wanted some peace for myself for just a short time and then I'd come back once I had time to breathe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut instead of understanding my needs, he put himself before everyone else as usual and started to try and tear me apart. Accusing me of many things, making low blows to get his 'point' across. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA friend doesn't do that. A friend understands your needs as well as their own, and respects boundaries.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor eighteen years, I thought that this was alright. So when I finally opened up and said something, I got slammed by another friend for speaking out against what had happened to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was told that because they were in an abusive relationship, they 'knew what was abuse and what wasn't' and that mine wasn't abuse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust because they didn't see the monster I had to put up with behind closed doors, in subtle hints and actions. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo stop telling people their abuse isn't abuse just because you think you had it worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLife isn't a competition; we need to help one another, not tear each other apart.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I keep having dreams about him, some are nice and some are nightmares. I keep wondering how he is doing, if I am causing him any pain with this. I don't want him to feel abandoned. I jeep on remembering the good times, when he seemed sweet and genuine. I keep struggling with the thought of him being a narcissist. What if he is just bipolar with narcissistic traits? I keep reminding myself of all that happened, reading excerpts from books and blogs. I don't have him on my contacts or social media, but today, I gave in and went into my WhatsApp blocked contacts to see his new picture. Unblocking is just click button away.... I know nothing goo will follow if I unblock him, but this feeling is like torture and I cannot stand it.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I.e, they believe overweight women are easier to beat and cannot out run abuse therefore are easier to control to make children and be obedient.\n\nI get told to \"put on meat\", if I put on muscle they get mad and angry with my body not being what they want... I get told to \"eat a burger\" but when I eat a burger I am yelled at and scolded and judged and called fat or selfish.

Being roommates for a year any issues/problems/feelings I had and brought up were made minimal or didn't exist. \n\nLiterally, \"It's not a big deal.\" Is what she would tell me.\n\n\"This is really the first problem we've ever had.\"\n\nThen have me hug it out and thing nothing was ever wrong or that she understood. \n\nAnother mutual friend of ours KNEW how she was but just didn't tell me WHAT it was. Only gave a vague answer to me. \"Being roommates with a friend never works out.\" \n\nIt started off with I couldn't do, bring things/people into the house without permission. Yet she could do whatever. Different guys who would sleep over, use my towels, etc. She always called the apartment that we rented \"HER\" home. I couldn't just do whatever I wanted in \"HER\" house, but both of our names were on the lease. \n\nI had brought a stray kitten I had found going home. I had planned to keep it. During that timeframe she was going off on a year contract job and would not be present. The lease was soon to end and I had planned to not renew with her. That's just when it got worse. \n\n\"If you keep the cat it's going to be MY CAT.\"\n\nBut she didn't want to put in any of the work/money.\n\n\"You can't keep 2 cats in my house, I don't care if I'm gone. It's disgusting.\"\n\n\"Your trying to not renew? I don't have any family here to help me move. Your putting me in a bad spot.\" \n\nAny conversation I had was met with me thinking I was crazy in the end to ever put her through this \"stress\". \n\nI was able to find the stray kitten a good home, it broke my heart and I choose to renew until she returned from the contract work. \n\nWe were also coworkers. So now further down the line I suddenly had to do the contracted work as well. I had planned for my sister who was in college and working to stay in the apartment and watch my older cat. I would still handle my half of the rent, and my sister would pay for utilities. Another problem came. \n\n\"I want your sister to pay us rent.\" \n\nIt made absolutely no sense, nothing was coming out of this friends pocket but yet she insisted. That my sister should pay part of her rent. However even if I didn't have a cat and needed someone she'd still have to pay her portion of the rent. \n\n\"It'll teach your sister responsibility, you do too much for her.\" \n\nThis was the first thing I ever fought on and didn't budge, my sister was doing me a favor. Watching my cat and paying all the utilities. It was a lot of back n forth and emotional strain. It got so bad sometimes at work I'd have to walk off and cry to myself. Why does she act this way and towards me? The mutual friend between us would let me vent to her but then turn back around and tell the ex friend everything and later she would attack me about it. I don't trust the mutual friend with anything anymore. \n\nI started getting it at work as well. She once snapped her fingers at me like a dog repeatedly and told me to come here. I reacted badly to it, told her not to speak to me that way and finally complained about it. She was reprimanded lightly, a slap on the wrist. Once it was over she turned on me full swing.\n\n\"How could you tell them I talk to you like a dog?!\"\n\nYou do.\n\n\"You know these people are evaluating me and my performance as a leader?!\"\n\nYour horrible.\n\nShe made it out to make it seem like I was the problem entirely.\n\nA blessing slapped me in the face. She couldn't do the contracted work anymore. She had to go home. I didn't have to DEAL WITH HER. I didn't renew the lease as planned and my family had all my things moved out in a day. She tried to guilt trip me into just giving her things we split on instead of her paying the other half to get them. I ending up paying the whatever half and sold it closer to the market price so my money was made back. I didn't let her push me which I was proud of. \n\nWhen people saw me alone (ex friend was gone and mutual friend worked in a different area) they described to me the abuse they saw. Ask me was I okay... That's when it really broke my heart and knew I couldn't have just been imagining it. I feel like I've gone through some kind of emotional abuse. After settling apartment matters I block her on everything. Even the number. I want her to in no way contact me.\n\nEven with work. I spoke to my supervisor and everything was settled. Only he and the line leader were to have my number. My NEW phone number. If I had to work with her fine, but other than the work place I felt she has no business with me. The \"mutual friend\" said she wasn't taking sides, but she's quick to tell me I'm over sensitive and take things too personal. Basically invalidates anything. I just smile and wave for now until this contract is over... But when they talk about the ex friend openly I just think of the possibility of having to deal with her as soon as I get back sends me into some kind of spiral. A panic attack. I need time to be away from ALL the people who tolerated her behavior towards me. To get my mind together.

It's important because if you claim time off for this, you are protected from getting fired for it. It's something to look into if you feel you might need it.

His apartment were extremely messy, he's unhealthy and had not been doing anything new, or even much at all. He is still a hypocrite about most things. He still doesn't respect my boundaries at all (though now I do, so I will do that for him). He still casually gaslights and lies, and thinks I dont know. He dramatize things (this is especially a thing that have been interesting seeing now, as I felt back then that I always were the dramatic one, but now I can actually finally see how he takes one statement and then escalates it out of orbit). It makes every discussion want to pull my eyes out of my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing in a better place now within myself, I can look at all of this with a new set of eyes. All the guilt I felt in and after the relationship, for being too demanding and emotional, I understand now is because the circumstances was truly not a place for a good relationship to blossom. His negative qualities were not my fault, nor my doing. They are still there, with or without me, and they always will be until he deals with them. Absolutely no relationship, with me or somebody else will ever make them go away. I finally begin to understand that I really gave it all I got within a confined space for love and communication. I lost myself and became so sad, because no matter what I did, it was never enough to change it, and I truly believed it was because I was not good enough.\n\nSeeing this now, all this time after have been a real life changing experience. I would never enter a relationship with another person who does those things now. I did then because I did not think I was worth more, or allowed to ask for more. I know I am now. Being able to say no, without feeling like dying inside of feeling sorry for them, loneliness or any other shitty feeling, is such a relief. I broke the traumabond, to the point of having no hard feelings towards him and the things he have done. He is who he is.

I just need to get it off my chest.\n    I know this isn't probably a normal sort of post here, but I need some advice. However, I should give some   context before I get to my question. For three years, someone I once considered a friend manipulated me and used suicide as way to guilt me into doing things. This person also pursued me romantically, and any time I rejected their advances, they would use a lot of guilt tripping and again, suicide threats, to get their way. Its been three years since I broke things off with them, but even since then they've managed to get my phone number without my permission and have done things like follow me. I'm not diagnosed, but I'm pretty certain I have some form of PTSD from it. I would never claim to have a mental illness without knowing, but I would say its probable, just due to a lot of symptoms ive experienced, which include an actual auditory and visual hallucination, that I consider to be a flashback because of the nature of it. At the very least, I was heavily traumatized. So, cut to the present day, and I have this friend. She's my absolute best friend in the world, or at least, she is to me. But after I broke things off with the aforementioned person, we sort of drifted apart. Not because she sided with that person, or anything, but because our lives were so different. All three years during my friendship with that abuser, she was always pretty pessimistic. She put down my political views, and at one point accused me of identifying as bisexual just to be \"cool\". (I still identify as bisexual.) But I think the worst of it was her obsession with fitting in. She was always trying to get in with these \"popular kids\", and would frequently tell me things like \"its a good thing im friends with you, or who knows if youd even be friends with anyone\" or like, \"you must have no shame, you just dont care about what anyone thinks of you\". And that wasnt everyday, but it was enough that i just always felt like she must have thought I was just a weight on her whole social life. Now, its the present, and ive really sort of \"normaled\" out. I used to be really awkward and insecure, but i think over the years ive gotten a lot better at being confident in my own style and personality. For about two years we havent spoken at all, but now we're talking again, and she's totally different too. She actually kind of reminds me of how i was a few years ago. However, I have a really hard time being around her now. And this will sound so horrible, but I think a lot of it is the state of her mental health. She's really struggling with it, and of course it makes me worried, because I still care about her. But I also feel like I can't help at all. A lot of her struggle is with things like suicide and self harm. She even made an attempt a while back, which really put me into this dissasociative episode. I dont even think I cried at the time; i was just so completely out of it when I got to her house, I couldn't even cry. I might have, but I actually don't remember that night very well. I feel horrible that I can't seem to get around my fear for her, but I also wonder if it's worth putting myself through the emotional struggle just so I can be her friend again. It's not like she exactly treated me very well in the first place. But I care about her. I've known her for almost a decade. I just can't tell if she still thinks of me the same way she did all those years ago. So, am I being oversensitive? Should I be looking past my own emotional barriers in order to reach out to hers? Is it wrong of me to feel so detached when shes upset?\n\nTLDR: I was traumatized by someone who used suicide as a guilt tactic, and now a friend of mine I havent spoken to in years is struggling a lot. When she struggles, i feel like I can't help, even though I really want to, because I'm scared of what she might do. I feel selfish, but part of me feels justified because of how hard it is on me to talk about and deal with the subject of suicide. What should I do?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

If you have never been through this-it is absolute hell. Burning/tingling skin, waves of anger, sadness,anxiety, feeling suicidal and tears. Lots of tears. I\u2019m extremely diligent with my refills to make sure this never happens but this was essentially my doctors fault because he called in the wrong prescription. It was a mistake and he\u2019s usually amazing so I don\u2019t blame him. Everyone makes mistakes. Still, I\u2019m dealing with the consequences. I decided that I would go to work and tough through it but I\u2019ve been in a fog all day and wasn\u2019t able to get much done other than getting myself out of bed let the dogs out feed them and go to work. So the house was a mess. My narc is out of town so I figured it would be fine and I would have time to clean up when I got home.

Which is absolutely bullshit because I\u2019ve barely heard from him all week and he\u2019s been ignoring my texts.

But last night...ugh. \n\nHe travels for work and we hung out when he was home last weekend, but I said no sex because it had been 4 months since we'd last seen each other and I wanted to just enjoy his company. He was very respectful of that, because we've had issues before where he pushed and I didn't appreciate it, so I was actually really happy and we had a really nice, relaxing evening. \n\nHe was home again this weekend, and we had sex. It was amazing. Soo good. But afterwards... I mean first of all there's a huge heat wave and I know I for one was pretty sweaty lol. So we hugged our edges of the bed. But when I came down off my high and had cooled off, I rolled onto my side and just looked at him... And almost started crying. He doesn't cuddle. He refuses to kiss or make out, says it's not his thing. But I mean... In a normal relationship I would have had no problem getting close to him and kissing him, his chest, his arm, his lips, but no, \"we\" don't do that. We just had this amazing \"intimate\" experience and yet it just felt so completely, devastatingly hollow. \n\nWhenever I try to snuggle a bit after sex, he groans and complains and tells me to stop touching him. He says it like a child, in a fake whiny voice, and he LETS me do it. He claims to be \"just teasing\" but he's still mocking me, and he's still only \"letting\" me do it, it's not like he enjoys it or finds any need for it. And it just really got to me last night. Here we just had this mind blowing sex, and yet for the first time in over 4 years of this being the way things go and me just accepting it, I just felt completely empty and alone and sad. \n\nI went home last night, he left this morning to go back to his job site and he called me, spent at least 2 hours of the 5-hour drive talking to me, but I can't shake how I felt last night, reliving that one moment and how it made me feel, and I'm just so horribly sad. I will never understand these people, or this disorder, or why it hurts us so bad. I don't really know the point of my post other than maybe just to get it out and let it go? Idk. I just want to be healthy, and have a real relationship and in the moment I just feel so defeated and hopeless and also angry at myself for not only settling for an unavailable person, but letting myself feel real emotions for him, knowing it doesn't matter one bit to him.

So many others are suffering much worse than me.\u201d And I delete the post.  But the urge to talk and seek solace keeps nagging me.\n\nI want to talk.  I need to talk but I am starting to fear he will find my posts and get angry.  So much happens, so many little things, and I feel like I am either overreacting or in one fucked up relationship.  I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nI do know this, I have to share this because I triggered a memory of my past abuser in my mind.  I was away for a few days for work and came back to learn he had not been eating right while I was gone.  As in he hate the five pounds of beef I bought that was supposed to last us 2 weeks in 2 days.  By himself.\n\nToday he told me he was having problems \u201cdown there\u201d since I left.  It was painful to pee, he was getting painful erection that would last hours and he was constantly having to change his pants because he\u2019d just \u201cgo off\u201d over nothing.  He said it must have been all the chemicals in the beef and he needed to do something about the pain.  I told him he needed to see a doctor and stared at me.\n\nAn hour later he started making sexual jokes, moving dead bodies in his video game (Skyrim) into suggestive positions and point them out to me, and turned everything I said or did into a sexual innuendo.  For example, I had to build a hunting lodge in the game I was playing (silly town management in the ancient world) and said \u201cthey got the tents up\u201d and he made a comment I will not post here but you can probably guess.  When I did not laugh he called me a prude, sexually stunted and no fun.  Finally, he went to the bathroom and complained about how difficult it was to pee because of his \u201ctent\u201d.  When i again told him to see a doctor, he stopped.\n\nAnd, before you ask, no I did not realize he was trying to get me \u201cturned on\u201d or into bed until after he stopped talking to me for an hour after the bathroom thing.  I am both very naive and yet very blunt when it comes to my needs.  If you want sex, say \u201chey, let\u2019s have sex\u201d don\u2019t dance around the issue, and he knew this when we got married.   In fact it was one of the things he claimed he liked about me.\n\nBut this is the sort of thing, the innuendos and jokes and nasty comments were things my past abuser would do.  He\u2019d be horribly immature to the point of being gross until he\u2019d start crying about how I didn\u2019t love him because I never wanted to have sex.  So, we\u2019d have sex whether I was in the mood or not and he would complain about my performance.  My husband started doing that a year ago when stress was making it difficult for him to perform, yelling at me for not being ready or not having my eyes open or not having the pillows off the bed.  We stopped trying when he had an asthma attack before he even got \u201cexcited\u201d and almost punched a hole in the wall, and that was a year ago.  Now, for some reason, he wants it all the time but is being very immature about it.  And it scares me.\n\nBecause after the immaturity came the quiet rage.

They all reinforced the belief that I was the crazy one and he was struggling to live with me. \n\nMy psychiatrist was only interested in pushing pills.

He had another post stating that it was in fact official he would be leaving come September, and that's what I had saw when I looked at his account. However, in this specific province, he knows absolutely NO ONE. I have a very hard time comprehending that he is leaving this city and latching off his enabling, queen bee Narc of the family (his mother) and that he is even capable of living day-to-day life without her or his family. I say this because I know how dependent he is on her and how he falls into a deep, dark world of depression and insane lows hit every so often... When we were hanging out, he couldnt even keep his own apartment clean; I mean it was filthy, literally garbage and dirt everywhere, tons of empty water bottles and empty vaseline/lube containers in his bed, piles of dirty laundry in every corner (that I would help him clean)... Before I went NC, a part of me was even a bit worried about him leaving the province with no one besides his dog by his side. I just cant even begin to wrap my head around the fact that he really wont be here anymore either - I feel relaxed, at ease, optimistic, but then at the same time I truely cant see him actually leaving and then of course I still feel a little upset about it all that I wont be seeing him again, even though I have decided to go NC and I know in my heart that I cant be seeing him again regardless if hes here or not. Before the final discard and my choice of going NC, he tried to reassure me that we would still keep in contact and that he wanted to fly me out there to visit him every month or so... At the time, that did made me happy I'll admit... \n\nI guess my questions to you guys are... Has your Nex ever moved away and STILL tried to eventually Hoover? Have they even used this \"I'm moving\" tactic as a way to see you again before they left? Asking that especially because leading up to the discard, he had said to me \"I just want to have an amazing month with you before I leave, and you're ruining that. You could have a beautiful friendship with me, but you just choose to keep on bringing up stupid shit and acting like a maniac\". At this point, I know breaking NC and seeing him before he leaves would be pointless anyways. I'm feeling strong today and things are getting easier, but I still wonder about these things, and it feels great coming here and being able to voice thoughts, my feelings and asking for advice, venting and just asking questions about my situation without being judged for once... \n\nI think he really expects me to see him again before he leaves, or expects me to reach out and beg to see him and his dog like I have before.

But most frequently, in the context of a romantic relationship.\n\nRecently, I found out that my boyfriend has been lying to me and sexting other girls. Automatically, I think it is because I did something to make him do that.  \n\n\n&gt;**My thought process, for example;** You drove him away by being insecure, that's why he cheated, he sought out other girls because you're ugly, and you became even more ugly because you revealed your low self-esteem sometimes. You shouldn't have said that, you shouldn't have questioned his interest when he was pulling away it drove him away even more so.\n\n  \nI also struggle with feeling as if I need to prove myself worthy of love. That I am not intrinsically loveable. If I can be what someone wants, ***only then I am worthy***. If I can conform myself to their wishes, then I am worthy. But any time I slip up, any time I start to show my insecurities and my flaws I beat myself up even more.  \n\n\n&gt;**For example, with my boyfriend after our first date;** He told me he had stopped talking to other girls before we went on our first date (we talked over text/online for a few months before), but then I saw that right after we went on our date he was active on the dating app we met on. He lied. This started the feeling. Before that I was, of course, nervous to meet him. But when I saw that I was completely hurt. ***I wasn't good enough***. **I WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH**, this is the feeling that went over and over in my head.. and has permeated my life ever since we got together. At that point I stopped looking because it just hurt me too much. But then a few months later after we had talked about being EXCLUSIVE, my friend found him on a different dating app and he was active on it every day. I confronted him, calmly, and he lied about it. He kept lying to me, but maybe if I didn't confront him he wouldn't have lied? Maybe I pushed him to continue lying to me because I was insecure about what he was doing on the apps and questioned him.\n\n  \nAnd maybe he sensed that. Maybe he could tell that my self-worth was in the gutter. And maybe THAT made him unattracted to me, and in that case it is **MY FAULT**.  \n\n\n&gt;I have been trying my best to do some self reflection. ***I grew up in an abusive household*** where I was constantly made to feel at fault for everything. I was blamed for a lot. And my mother used to hit me and tell me I was worthless and she wished she had never had me... my lack of self-worth must come from my childhood. I always felt as if I had to prove myself to my mother but I just COULDN'T. **I was never good enough, and I never would be.** \"Why can't you be more like your sister?\" \"There's something wrong with you, you're not normal\" \"Nobody will ever love you because you don't love anyone\" \"You're pathetic\" \"You're just like your father - a loser\" \"You cause all the problems between me and your dad\" \"If we didn't have you I could be happy\" \"You're a pig and a slob\" I basically felt that unless I was ***exactly*** how she wanted me to be - I would never receive her love. I would never be good enough. I still feel this way in regards to her.  \n**\\*\\*** I also just realized that my mother also put my father down constantly, said he was a loser and worthless. Not only did she say I was just like him, but my father adored me! He didn't put me down like she did, and maybe subconsciously I formed the idea that only somebody who is \"worthless\" will love me. Anybody who is \"worthy\" will treat me badly.. like she did.\n\n  \nIf I really think about it.. the negative thoughts in my head sound like they could come ***directly from her***. \"It's your fault\" \"You're to blame\" \"If you hadn't done this, then he could be happy\" \"You're disgusting, ugly\" \"You'll never be good enough for him\" \"he's worthy, you're not\"  \n\n\nI have read a few books, and have attempted to stop the negative self-talk, but it is a constant. It's not just a voice in my head, it's an overarching feeling, something that I can't even necessarily quantify. It's just there, I exist within it. It's almost as if it's all I've ever known. And how can I begin to tackle something that feels bigger than me?

I just don\u2019t want to live angry anymore", "author": "srkate", "self_text": "I was a teenager when I met this boy, and he was the sweetest, funniest, smartest most charming boy I\u2019d ever met. He was outgoing and popular at school, pretty much everyone liked him. He had always labeled himself as a feminist. The only people who ever didn\u2019t really like him were some guys who thought he was annoying because he was so outgoing some people tended to be put off by it I guess. When we first started dating the relationship was amazing. And it all happened so slow I didn\u2019t even realize until one day I took a step out and saw how fucked up it had become. My therapist always compared me to a pile of marbles. She said it\u2019s like you\u2019re this huge pile, then every few days or weeks he just takes 1 marble away, like maybe telling me he doesn\u2019t like when I wear leggings, and you figure okay..it\u2019s only one marble I have a ton of them, but it keeps happening and eventually you don\u2019t have many marbles left and you want to stop it but now he has so much control that you can\u2019t stop it without knowing there will be repercussions. It started with light jealousy when I spoke to other boys without him around. Then it became fights about it. And then it came to my clothes, no leggings, no dresses, no shorts, no going to the beach bc of how revealing swimsuits are, no cutting or changing your hair in any way. No piercings. No going places without checking with him first. No time to myself. If I was working I had to text him at least once every three hours which I told him I can\u2019t do and he freaked so I snuck texts out to him during shifts and my coworkers probably thought I was a lazy piece of shit but I was just trying to make sure I didn\u2019t get screamed at and shoved for the next 3 hours after my shift. He demanded I let him look through my phone frequently. He didn\u2019t like my friends and didn\u2019t want me to see them. He didn\u2019t like how much time I spent with my mother. He didn\u2019t like the way my bedroom was decorated. Small meaningless things like where I put my nightstand became a big deal. I have bad anxiety and always have, and I take medicine to control it and see a therapist and he used this against me. Saying I was crazy. Twisting my words and everything comes down to I am crazy and can\u2019t make my own decisions because I have this mental illness. He had my location. My Snapchat password. My Instagram password. My iCloud password. He wanted my bank account info and I wouldn\u2019t give it to him and he got upset. When we broke up he kept saying \u201ctell me what I did wrong\u201d over and over and I gave him dozens of examples and he denied he was wrong. When I got up to leave he grabbed my arm hard, I yelled at him to let go and he just had this look and goes \u201cno you need to tell me what I did wrong you owe me that\u201d. I pulled my arm away and went inside. I was alone that night, and I heard my bedroom door open around midnight and he was standing at the end of my bed screaming saying I needed to tell him what he did wrong. It looked like he had something behind his back, but he definitely tried to intimidate me and make me think he was going to physically lash out often. I thought he had a knife. I told him to lay in bed with me because I thought he was going to stab me. I wanted to deescalate the situation. He held me all night and I just felt sick the entire time. He left early for work and I got in the shower and just cried and scrubbed at my skin like I was covered in spiders because I just couldn\u2019t help but feel like he was still on me. When I left for college I was finally in a safe space to end things. Out of state. So I did and he texted and called hundreds of times the next few months. When I didn\u2019t respond he reached out to my friends and told them about how I always blew them off to hang out with him. Which I did do. I only did it because if I ever spent time with them instead of him he would freak out. So I became a huge flake on all of them. I had nightmares of specific situations for awhile after the breakup. I still have some now, but they\u2019re not so specific, they\u2019re more just anything about him being upset, they\u2019re usually physically and sexual violent in manner. I wake up feeling sick. Now here I am and so much time has passed and I\u2019m still angry. And that\u2019s the worst part of it all because I\u2019m sure he\u2019s gone and moved on and is probably doing this o some other poor girl and doesn\u2019t think about me at all and I just am angry. I\u2019m not over it. As much as I want to be. Because if I was I wouldn\u2019t be so angry. I keep telling myself I am. Try the whole fake it till you make it thing but it\u2019s not working.

His two kids are about 10-12 years younger than me, one living on her own.

I don\u2019t trust people anymore and it\u2019s really hard to ever see myself trusting someone again without the thought in the back of my head doubting everything. \n\nIt\u2019s just really hard to see things getting better, every thought I have is negative.

I just did not feel comfortable using the standard N, so I used something else. I did not use this person's actual name, but I do realize that using what I did was a mistake. Sorry!\n\n(I'd like to start out by saying that I am not diagnosing my roommate L with NPD. I'm not a psychologist, and I don't feel comfortable calling him one. But, I will say that the parallels between how he treated me and how a narc treats their target is making me very uneasy. I tried posting this to a Nice Guy subreddit, but the post was deleted and I was told it would fit better here. After reading through the resources provided, I agree).\n\n.\n\nThis is a story most easily told broken down month by month. I apologize for the odd formatting ahead of time.  \n.  \nNovember 2018: I became very sick with blood clots in my lungs. They basically tore up my lungs. I had to move out of my parent's house, because they did not have time to take proper care of me. My friend offered that I move in with he and someone else I would learn has strong narc tendencies- L. I do so in December. L and I become very close in this time very quickly, since he is the one primarily taking care of me while I cannot take care of myself. All is well.  \n.  \nJanuary 2019: L begins acting strangely- he begins to tell me about how wonderful I am, how he's never met a girl quite like me. According to him I've broken down all his defenses, and I understand him like nobody does. L says that he's told me things he would never dream of telling anybody else, and he begins to buy me small gifts. Nothing extravagant yet, just stuff like a pack of fruit snacks or a gum he knows I like. Toward the end of the month I realized that L has a crush on me, and he begins hinting that he has a secret to tell me but can't, as it would ruin our friendship. I don't like him like that, but I choose to play dumb for fear of losing a friend.  \n.  \nFebruary 2019: L's love bombing continues to escalate, until one night in late February he finally confesses. Not wanting to make him upset, I let him down as gently but firmly as I know. L tells me that he's not mad, but he's not surprised. To quote, \"After all, you're really pretty, crazy talented, and amazing. Girls like you don't date fat ugly guys like me. Either way I've been alone for like... Six years. I'll survive\". This makes me very uncomfortable, but I don't comment on it. I assume it's all over and things will go back to normal.  \n.  \nMarch 2019: L, after backing down for a week or so, begins a new tactic- guilt. He begins what feels like a constant barrage of guilt trips. Every couple of days or so he sinks into a low mood, and when I ask him about it he tells me he's depressed from thinking about how he's going to die alone. He details how each of his exes has been a crazy psycho who abused him in some way or another, how he had hoped that by dating me he could have a good relationship, and sometimes how he felt so alone he wanted to die. He talked about how he wanted to move out because he couldn't bear being near me knowing I didn't return his feelings. Eventually I stopped asking him what had him down when he got in those moods, but that ended up being worse. He would get upset and claim that I didn't care about him because I wasn't there for him when he was depressed, and I believed him. I thought I was being selfish, so I played into his hand and began asking him what was wrong again. He also started buying me gifts once more, this time more extravagant like an expensive paint sealer that had to be ordered overseas and merch from one of my favourite game series. When I told him I was uncomfortable with the gifts he got defensive, saying he was only trying to express his gratitude for my friendship. I dropped the issue.  \n.  \nEarly April 2019: L and I have our first fight. At this point I was so, so sick of hearing him constantly badger me about dating him. When he was ruminating about how we would make such a power couple I snapped and told him to get the f\\*\\*k over me, that I was sick of hearing him whine to me and that hearing it made me feel like crap. I went upstairs into my room, and he followed me. I locked myself in and told him to leave me alone. He refused and sat outside my door for an hour, crying and telling me he was sorry. My anger diffuses with each personal horror he tells me- how his grandma is in the hospital, his mom's Lyme's disease is coming out of remission, his dad disowned him, etc. Eventually I forgive him, he swears he's over me.  \n.  \nMid-April- Early June 2019: This time frame is basically a blur- the breakneck pattern of \"You're amazing, I really appreciate you, you're so wonderful\" to \"You were never grateful for anything I did, even when I sat outside your door pouring my heart out to you\" to \"Are we friends? It wasn't me talking, it was -insert generic excuse about stress-\" really kicked into high gear and took a toll on me. He slowly escalated the abuse he hurled at me when he was in his middle phase, eventually getting to the point when he told me I deserved the emotional abuse my ex did because I was emotionally abusive, to telling me my dad should have hit me harder so I would respect other's emotions. When we were back to being friends I would tell him that the things he would say to me would hurt and took things too far, and he would either shug and not say anything or would say I was being too dramatic, after all he said he was sorry. When I would point out that he did not apologize ever he would say that he had, I just must not have remembered it, I was just trying to make him look like the a\\*\\*hole, or would accuse me of trying to start up another fight. Whenever I would tell him to leave me alone he would refuse, either messaging me long paragraphs hurling insults or, since we lived together, would physically block the exit of the room I was in and make me listen to what I had to say. Again, when confronted with this he would get upset- \"I didn't block you! You could have walked past/There was a door right there/I wasn't even standing in the way\". He starts spending more time in his room, and I let him. He slowly stops responding to my inquiries to hang out in his room, and I let it taper off. I wasn't about to beg him every day to please let me hang out with him. It hurt, still hurts, but I stick to it.  \n.  \nEarly June-July 2019: Things really go off the rails when I get a boyfriend. He goes ballistic, accusing me of using him \"like a fuckin Kleenex\" and saying I must not have ever cared about him. He sends message after message telling me he feels hurt and betrayed, that I was just as bad as all his exes. Meanwhile he sends my boyfriend a message congratulating him on us getting together, then mentions how he's been feeling crappy lately. My boyfriend tells L that they can talk at any time, to which L tells him no since he's \"not the girlfriend\" and refuses to answer any more messages. Meanwhile, L is still harassing me. Then... Silence. He refuses to talk to me at all. I'd ask him how his day was and he wouldn't even look in my direction. This goes on up until a week ago, when I asked him about where his cat was going since the apartment he was moving into didn't allow pets. He gives me an answer, then says he didn't think I wanted to talk to him. I tell him that I really don't want to talk to him, but this wasn't about us. It was about the cat. He sends me a pages-long message in response about how he knows that I've been demonizing him to all our friends (I'd been asking them for help on his to deal with his behaviour), how he's been nothing but friendly and cordial to me while I proved his point about how I do nothing but villianize others who I dislike, how I gave him the cold shoulder just because he dared have feelings for me at one point. He tells me that people do not believe me because \"People KNOW me, and they KNOW you're full of shit\" . He told me \"You treat people like garbage. You manipulate, and lie, and twist things so they're always in your favour. You say I said cruel things? No, I didn't. I told you I was hurt\". He then said some stuff about how all I brought was immense drama and animosity into his life. He finished it off with \"Goodbye ThrowawayMcAlterson, I really hope someday you grow as a person and realize that people leave you not because they're bad people, but because you treat them like trash\" and blocks me. L sends a message to my boyfriend saying he still wants to be friends with him, but he's going to block my boyfriend and that my boyfriend is free to believe whatever he wants. Since then he occasionally tosses backhanded 'nice' remarks my way, and when I tell him to fuck off he gets offended and says he can't say he didn't try being friendly to me.  \n.\n\nI thought he was just a nightmare case of Nice Guy. But like I said, after reading through the resources provided I realize he's got strong narc tendencies. The love bombing, the cycle of love-fade-throwaway, the gaslighting, the projecting... All red flags I feel like I should have recognized but didn't. I always thought narc abuse could only be done if you were dating. I think I was wrong. Reguardless, he's got his hooks in my head. And it hurts to see other people, namely my boyfriend, play friendly with him even knowing what he's done to me and all the incredibly messed up stuff he said to me. Does anyone else have that?

It was about a year ago and it was over xbox/ instagram (f17). So I was very desperate to fine someone to love because I was fresh out of another internet relationship. I met this guy through my ex and he was a good friend of my for the time being (m21). He finally confessed his feelings after a few weeks of playing games and caught me off guard. Since I was so desperate I agreed to date him. About a few months past (3-4) and we are doing great but we started doing sexual stuff but taking pictures was never something we did.  A few more months past and I start to get paranoid because I never liked my parents knowing that I dated online (my mom was against it) . We were constantly messaging so it was a little scary. We started saying I love you not long after, but it was also very hard for me to say it out loud without being caught by my parents so this also got on his nerves a bit. He started also constantly buying me games and micro transactions on my account. Maybe a month pasted and he began to get more intrusive. He would log into every account I had and would check interactions I had with my friends or random people I met in matches. I would send friendly message to friends saying \u2018babe\u2019 and \u2018I love you\u2019 He would become upset are threat to take drugs (he was addicted before and apparently threw them out while dating me) when he saw these. I apologized and thought nothing of it. This become too much for me with school and my parents and the stress of being caught that I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore and I ended the year relationship. This is where it all started. I know I could have just blocked him but I felt like I loved him so it was very difficult. He would harass me and he would constantly check my accounts (I felt bad if I changed the passwords). He would force me to call him every night and sleep on the phone with him. He would constantly hear me cry and beg him to let me leave the call and he would get hurt if I did this. I would constantly apologize. I started opening up to the people in my friend group. He got word of it and confronted me and forced me to apologize to everyone to the friend group and tell him that I lied. He would force me to sit on the phone with him when I did whatever and wanted pictures of my face pretty much everyday. He stressed me out every time I went out of the house or went to hang out with friends or family. He would call me when friends were over. I remember specifically on Halloween night I was hanging out with a few friends and I ignored my ex. My friends and I decided to watch a movie and within that movie I had a totally of 100+ phone calls and who knows how many text messages. I made my friends leave early to call him and make sure he wouldn\u2019t tell my parents about the relationship we had ( he had looked up and found my family members and some friends on Facebook and Instagram) and I was also afraid that he would threaten to fly to my house and tell my parents about the relationship. A few days after that I opened up to a friend and I finally had the courage to change my passwords and block him off of everything that I had.

We have a good thing going.\u201d I showed him the text message and he played it off as nothing. They will say anything to keep you around a moment longer. \n\nThe devaluing was brutal. If I wanted to talk about my feelings and how he had hurt me I was too sensitive. I was over reacting. I was told I acted like I had never been in a relationship before, that I was immature and pathetic for Always crying. I didn\u2019t know how to be an adult. If I called him out on a text I found on his phone to other women he would deny it. I told him exactly what I read and he would keep asking me \u201cwhere did you see that? I never said that. She didn\u2019t stay the night here.\u201d \u201cI just read the entire conversation on your phone while you were passed out on the couch.\u201d \u201cWhere does it say she stayed here? You\u2019re crazy.\u201d I would keep telling him it was on his phone and he would never admit to it. At all. To end it all he said \u201cyou\u2019re crazy. I\u2019ve heard all about you. I know all about what you do.\u201d Keep in mind this is 6 months into our relationship and he knows no one who knows me personally. This was a way to make me seem insane and him to seem innocent. The more I called him out on his BS the worse it all got. \n\nI call this the worse night. It\u2019s when I really realized how bad it had gotten. I came over on a Saturday in February. The following day I helped him pick up his son from school and I asked if we were still on for dinner the following night. He said yes. I told him I would be there before noon. He lives 45 minutes from me. \n\nNext day I text him and hear nothing. I leave the house, it\u2019s 12:30 by now. I tell him I\u2019m on my way. He says \u201cwhat? Already? Me and (his son) aren\u2019t even home.\u201d Interesting.... I told him that was okay and I would just wait in front of his house till he got there. He told me I always did this. I always just came over whenever I wanted and never waited to hear from him first. We had already agreed the day before. This was not a surprise visit. He was so concerned about me waiting in front of his house. I said \u201c you\u2019re with someone, I know you are. That\u2019s why you\u2019re so concerned about me waiting at your house for you. You know I\u2019ll see you\u2019re a liar.\u201d \u201c NO I\u2019M NOT WITH SOMEONE. You never listen and now you\u2019re going to be sitting in front of my house: kind of creepy.\u201d How is this creepy? To wait for someone at their house that you are supposed to be dating? The hell? He asked me again if I was going to be at his house waiting.\n\nI ended up waiting in the Walmart parking lot for him. I knew full well he was with someone he didn\u2019t want me to see. I sat there and cried. I was in an instant bad mood when I got to his house. We were helping his son practice writing some letters for school and I asked him when he wanted to go to dinner. He assumed I was paying for it, and I said I had never said that. He got so damn angry about that. He said \u201cusually when someone invites someone to dinner they pay.\u201d This was not our first dinner out. This fool bought me dinner one night of our whole relationship. I paid any other time. Not to mention put food on his damn table\nWhen he couldnt afford it. I told him I was paying for mine and he was on his own for him\nAnd his son. I told him I was tired of always paying. \n\nThat was it. He got up off the floor where his son was sitting and he yelled that he didn\u2019t know why I was even there. That I was in a shitty mood anyway and hadn\u2019t said two words to him. Maybe because of what happened earlier? Wasn\u2019t his fault, of course. According to him\nI was just a miserable person. This was my fault. I was crying at this point. He ignored me and got his son ready to go to dinner.  I told him he was an awful person. That he was always talking down to me. So he mocked me. I told him he was being condescending. He called me a child. I reluctantly joined them for dinner and he hit on the waitress in front of me. His friend showed up and he was making sexual comments about her with him as I sat across the table. He got great enjoyment watching me hurt. \n\nWhen we got back to his house he told me he was pretty much done with Me. He couldn\u2019t take my emotions and tears any longer.  I was a sobbing mess. He laughed at me. He said he was going to record me on his phone so I could see how pathetic I was being. I was so attached to him that I begged him not to do this. He was yelling at me on his front porch where his neighbor could hear. He called me obsessed. He said \u201cwho drives 45 minutes almost everyday to see someone? That\u2019s  crazy.\u201d I called him out on never appreciating what I have done for him and he said he never asked me for anything. That I always used that to make him feel guilty. This was the first discard. The next day I messaged him and called him. He screamed at me on the phone about all the things I had done wrong. I had smothered him and pushed him too far. I was too needy, clingy, and emotional. I told him I didn\u2019t want to lose him. That I didn\u2019t want him to hate me. He said he didn\u2019t hate me, and that I could fix this. I just needed to stop being so emotional. He pushed me to the state I was in. He made me into a lunatic. From February to March things were toxic as ever. Now I know it\u2019s because he had been seeing someone else behind my back and finally admitted to being with her at the end of February. His way of doing this was saying \u201cyou know I\u2019m seeing someone, right?\u201d I was devastated. He said he wanted to remain friends because i meant so much to him. Truth is, I was the only one helping him so he needed me around still.  Any time after that when  I saw him we got into a yelling match. I would ask him what was so different about her. Why he could easily commit to her and I was\nNever a for sure thing. He never had a good answer for me. \n\nOnce she found out I was still in the picture he discarded me in the most Brutally embarrassing way and I haven\u2019t heard from him since. That was 4 months ago. He now has moved in with her And seems to be living the dream. I keep hoping karma will step In and give him what he deserves but it hasn\u2019t done me a solid yet. \n\nHe totally destroyed my sense of self, and my self esteem. I was reduced to nothing by the time he left which is why I had become so pathetic. I was trying all I could to make him\nStay. It\u2019s been 4 months and I still feel lost and pathetic. He\u2019s moved on and seems just so happy. I\u2019m here miserable.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

At the horrendous end of the spectrum of physical abuse are the stories we hear about beating, burning, rape, mutilation, sex slaves etc. and at the lesser end of the spectrum we hear about people using their physicality to bully and get their way. In a healthy marriage the couple respect each other\u2019s physical boundaries and sex is a mutually agreed upon part of intimacy. In between the healthy and extremely unhealthy we find what we put up with, what we ignore, what we can\u2019t ignore, and finally what we can\u2019t accept anymore. Usually physical abuse is easier for the victim to identify with the right questions. We need to provide a safe place for the person going through physical abuse to speak about what is happening, knowing there is a strong emotional component denying, rationalizing, shaming and blaming one\u2019s self. If you are in a physically abusive relationship, hire a therapist qualified to help you safely leave the relationship. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***2. Emotional Abuse***\n\nEmotional abuse again can be on a spectrum from overt emotional abuse \u201cYou fat pig, you stupid idiot.\u201d To more subtle signs of abuse \u201cAre you really going to wear that?\u201d \u201cStill haven\u2019t figured out how to cook yet have you,\u201d, \u201cNo one would ever have you if you left me,\u201d \u201cHaven\u2019t you learned anything\u201d?. Even with these more subtle comments we can still identify the emotional abuse happening if we give the victim examples. One client was stunned when I gave her several examples of emotional abuse which she had numbed herself into believing were normal. Other types of abuse are when you are set up and or controlled. When one person has an important event he/she needs to prepare for and the partner feeling threatened and insecure, creates drama to sabotage the others success, this is a form of emotional abuse. When one partner wants to learn something new and the other feeling threatened makes fun of the new information this is also abuse. Lying is a very destructive form of emotional abuse as well. Many forms of emotional abuse are more difficult for the victim to identify due to some accommodating behavior to accept the abuse as normal. Emotional abuse also unfortunately, is the hardest for the courts to identify, so the person often feels abused by the spouse and by the court. A lot more work has to be done with identifying emotional abuse.  If you feel you have been a victim of emotional abuse, hire a therapist, read books, attend workshops, so you can get the tools you will need to stop being a victim.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***3. Emotional Neglect***\n\nOur partners commit to be our cheerleaders, have our backs, encourage us, give us empathy and compassion, care about our thoughts, ideas, and opinions, engage in conversations on a regular basis and provide a safe emotional environment. When one partner withholds this emotional support to punish or just because, we need to identify this behavior. Regular conversations of support are a cornerstone of a healthy marriage and a part of the asset bank of a marriage. If these are not happening, hire a therapist to see if you can get back on track. As we all know when the foundation has cracks the building is at risk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***4. Physical Neglect***\n\nThe word marriage means we are partners and we have committed to being the best partner we can be. When you start withholding physical affection, touches, a sexual relationship, physical comfort, and generally acting like a roommate or withholding to punish you are not acting in a healthy manner. If both partners agree this is what they want we don\u2019t have a victim. If one wants a physical relationship \u201cHouston we have a problem.\u201d Hire a couples\u2019 therapist to get back on track.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***5. Your body is breaking down***\n\nMy assessment is your body will start to break down when you are lying to yourself. Anxiety and depression are classic signs of something is not right. Physical symptoms may also begin to develop. One woman told me she developed a tumor (benign) in her throat when she was in an abusive relationship and couldn\u2019t speak or stand up for herself. Being in an abusive marriage, triggers all the bad juices in your body and you need to be vigilant and not rationalize the symptoms away. Healthy marriages produce better health for both partners so making yours healthy if possible with therapy is an investment in you!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are volumes written on all aspects of abuse so if you feel you are at risks don\u2019t put your head in the sand. Hire people qualified to help you with any form of abuse in your marriage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u201cA healthy relationship doesn\u2019t drag you down. It inspires you to be better.\u201d Mandy Hale\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis article was originally published on Divorceforce.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\u00a9 2019 Dr. Anne Brown, Author and Narrator of \"Backbone Power The Science of Saying No\" ebook &amp; audiobook available at Amazon and Backbone Power website.***", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Help on how to go through with it?", "author": "EternalAkatsuki", "self_text": "I\u2019ve posted here before at my narc partner and have been advised to end it. I\u2019ve just always found the thought so scary. I can\u2019t stand the thought of them with anyone else, I know I\u2019ll miss them, and I wonder what to do without them. Today hit the nail in the coffin for me. \n\nI\u2019m a recent college grad and I\u2019ve been looking into working, but the time my narc demands from me (all of it) has made me put off so many things in my life. My birthday was this week, so I went out on a trip for it for a couple of days. During that time my narc was oddly quiet, but when I got home I was guilted passively aggressively for not making time for them. Today, I mentioned finally getting a steady job to get money. They got mad I\u2019d mentioned it while they were concentrating on something and then acted passive and depressed. Later they told me that they\u2019re \u2018trying\u2019 to be okay with the idea of spending even less time with me and that they can\u2019t be passive and just say it doesn\u2019t bother them. The conversation and the tone of it made me feel so defeated. And I realized that the conversation was meant to make me feel that way. So I didn\u2019t do what I needed to do or felt at least guilty about doing it. Anything that\u2019s not focused on them gets turned into this. I can understand missing someone but is this how missing someone is meant to be?\n\nI still am questioning if I did something wrong or I\u2019m being inconsiderate or overreacting but I feel so drained and so tired. I need to know this is the right decision and If anyone has any words of advice or encouragement to break up with a narc, I would appreciate it.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I worry that I'm broken now and incapable of loving someone like I want to again. I've told one of the guys that is into me as much, but he seems to not care/not understand my inability to give freely of myself anymore. It's not fair to him. It's not fair to anyone.

He has substance abuse issues and will readily admit that he is an alcoholic. His sister is convinced their father has narcissistic personality disorder and while I see some traits in my partner I wonder if he\u2019s just acting out the way his father treated his mother rather than truly suffering from narcissistic personality disorder... idk, maybe I\u2019m too forgiving. \n\nAnyway here\u2019s the things that seem narcissistic to me:\n\nHe was hyper jealous from the beginning. Yet has asked for non-monogamy multiple times. He has cheated on every partner before me. Unclear whether he has cheated on me or not... says he has not but it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess. \nWhen we fight he calls me a bitch. Says things like \u201cyou\u2019re crazy\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re not a nice person\u201d \u201cI hate you\u201d \u201cfuck you\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re no fun\u201d etc. \nHe has a bad relationship with his mother/family and dislikes most people. \nHe is highly intelligent and very charming. \nHe withholds affection when I ask for it and refuses to reassure me within our relationship.\n\nBut there are things that don\u2019t add up to me\n\nHe can be extremely pleasant and kind. \nHe is great with our children. \nHe does have a couple long-term male friendships. \nHe is very generous and willing to admit his faults in a calmer environment. \nHe just seems like a genuinely good person at his core...\nHe is funny and goofy and upbeat. \n\nThe issues only seem to arise with substance abuse or in heated situations.\n\nWhen I read about narcissists they seem to have no redeeming qualities but he has many in my opinion.\n\nAny insight is welcome and appreciated.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Hope you enjoy.\n\nI\u2019ll try to keep this story short: 367 days ago I was discarded. Cruelly, mercilessly, spitefully.\n\nIt all went from 0 to 100 real quick\u2014one day we were talking about our day and saying we loved each other and then suddenly it was over. All the metaphors apply: right out of the blue, rug pulled out from under me, left hanging by a thread, etc. \n\nHe fucked his coworker while I was out of town, refused to let me into our shared apartment, put all my things in storage and told everyone I was abusive for reacting with shock. (*My post history has all the gory deets if you\u2019re in the mood for a horror movie*)\n\nBesides weeping uncontrollably on the phone during our last conversation, begging him to talk to me in person and then walking to the Golden Gate Bridge and seriously contemplating suicide for the first time in my life...I think I took it all in stride \ud83d\ude02\n\nI spent the first few weeks in a daze, listening to white noise, waking up a dozen times each night in a cold sweat, wearing Jackie O sunglasses so I could hide my tears in public, forcing myself to eat spoonfuls of peanut butter when I was too weak from hunger to walk...well, I\u2019m sure you all know the hell they drop you into post-discard. It took months to feel anything but agony, yet slowly the third degree burns heal and you can start to experience emotions other than pain and rage and sorrow. \n\nIt\u2019s been a year of hard work\u2014367 (give or take some drunken sleepovers) of falling asleep alone, managing my thoughts, sorting through the memories, reminiscing and regretting and remembering and reliving. \n\nThat last part is so important\u2014not about reliving the past but learning how to actually re-live: accepting that my old life was dead and burying it was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do but it was the only way I could heal. I realized I had to stop storing his skeleton in my closet. I deleted every trace of him from my life. I re-programmed my mind to remove his virus from my thoughts. I am by no means healed and still struggle with low self esteem brought on by his sadistic abandonment, but I learned how to live my life again. \n\nThat meant finding contentment in the small things, simple pleasures that brought me peace and respite from the chaos and torment of the last year. Closing my eyes when a good song came on, savoring the taste of delicious food (like dipping buttery toast into a runny egg \ud83d\ude0a\u2728) laughing deeply at something stupid, even getting the occasional road rage...these emotions, the gratitude and hope and even the anger, they helped me heal. I got to know myself again through these seemingly ordinary moments. I was so used to the extraordinary gestures, the extreme emotions, lovebombing and obsession and gaslighting that I forgot what it was like to just simply exist. \n\nNarcissists are not fully human and they can\u2019t experience the spectrum of emotion like we can. They can only live in extremes and that\u2019s poison to people like us, people who can empathize and accept and love. They are drowning and cling to us while they wait for some distant ship to pull them on board. When it inevitably shows up they will leave us alone in the water to slip beneath the waves. \n\nWell, I still fucked up today because I unblocked the new supply out of morbid curiosity. Between an intense mercury in retrograde and the one year discard mark I had been wondering what these two slimy little cockroaches were up to. And then I saw the post, the two of them clinking champagne glasses, and a \u201chappy 365 \u2764\ufe0f\u201d caption. \n\nI cried into my cold brew, and it felt good. \n\nBecause I knew that while it was all deeply, cosmically wrong\u2014I\u2019ve been alone while he gets all the sex and comfort and validation he wants\u2014it\u2019s all so right at the same time. \n\nThey\u2019re just two fools clinging to each other in the water. I\u2019m a castaway on my island but I\u2019ve learned how to survive on my own and with the help of family and friends who genuinely love me. At thirty I\u2019m finally learning how to be a functional adult\u2014metaphorically splitting coconuts open on sharp rocks and spearing fish and making fires under the stars and yeah, I\u2019m alone for the most part but when I\u2019m not I\u2019m having genuine moments of pure life. Just existing without the toxic mold of false affection and conditional obsession infecting my life, no longer holding my breath and waiting for the other shoe to drop. \n\nSure I still sometimes miss the fog of illusion\u2014the \u201clove\u201d we shared (that wasn\u2019t love) and the deep bond we had (more like trauma bond.) I can say with complete transparency that I don\u2019t love him anymore, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget him and that\u2019s okay because I\u2019m fully human and it\u2019s okay to feel things deeply. It\u2019s okay to hurt even as you\u2019re healing. \n\nThe Japanese have a pottery technique for broken vases, they mend the cracks with gold\u2014Kintsugi (\u91d1\u7d99\u304e, \"golden joinery\") *As a philosophy, it treats breakage and repair as part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise*\n\nMy scars will always be here, but they gleam now. \n\nIt\u2019s not a happy ending exactly but I\u2019m sleeping through the nights, no more waking up from nightmares, no more romanticizing the bones. \n\nHere\u2019s to a clean, fresh slate.

It is a country where hundreds of rape and molestation cases are reported everyday, a lot of them even involving children of ages below 10. In short, it's a very shitty place to live.\n\nI was molested by an auto rickshaw (tuk tuk) driver when I was 16. I was returning from a friend's birthday party and I took an auto rickshaw and there were people already sitting in the back so I had to sit in the front seat (there are very small seats on either side of the driver). The driver asked me questions like if I had a girlfriend and started talking about how he had no problem fucking a guy if he didn't find a girl to fuck, he said he enjoys fucking guys too. I tried to ignore him. Then he started touching me inappropriately and I ignored it too. I didn't do anything, he kept touching me everywhere for 20 mins and asked me if I wanted to fuck and I just tried to ignore him. That day I got home and surprisingly it was all normal for me, I didn't feel angry or sad or anything. I was 16, I knew what molestation was but my brain just didn't want to acknowledge anything and didn't show me any red flags. I forgot about the whole thing the next day and life was normal. I literally forgot that it ever happened.\n\nI never believed it could happen with me, I forgot everything like it was nothing. Recently, when the #metoo movement brought light to these issues, I had a flashback and re analysed what had happened. I felt very bad. I felt disappointed in myself as I was molested and I didn't do anything, I could have tried to fight back or reach out to other passengers for help. I found it very weird but to be honest, I remember I didn't feel trapped by him or helpless in any way, I could have simply asked him to stop the auto and I could have left as there were other passengers and he couldn't have denied. I feel really angry with myself for not leaving when I had the chance to stop myself from being molested.\n\nI realised that I lived thinking nothing like that happened with me ever. It's like my brain kept that memory quarantined somewhere. Now that I remembered what had happened, I don't find it right to tell people, or even think about it. I think that I lived 3 years without any memory of anything that happened that day. When I have lived like that, now I am only using it to gain sympathy and seek attention if I tell someone about it. I have lived for a long time with no thought of it, so why bring it up now?\n\nIt's not that someone I tell will think that I am trying to gain sympathy. I will probably never tell anyone the whole thing in detail (partly because no one will believe that I forgot I was molested and remembered 3 years later). When I tell them about just that day no one will think I am an attention seeker or anything, my friends will obviously support me.

She got angry and left.\n\nShe came and met me and told me about the nights events. I was pretty vocal about how I thought that he wasn\u2019t a great person. As soon as I started to show any disapproval of him she became angry with me.\n\nThere is a lot more history about her and her family I know but that would take days to write down and I think the relevant information is all here.\n\nI just want to help her. Any time the conversation ever turns serious about something not happy she changes it. Any time something annoys her she gets irrationally angry. If she\u2019s been drinking she has a tendency to be violent, not necessarily in an outright attacking kind of away but still violent. \n\nWhat can I say that isn\u2019t going to set her off?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Whether him telling me things about his past (in juxtaposition with our own relationship) is a form of triangulation and a way of introducing insecurity, idk...All I know is that I've heard so much about narcs following the same relationship patterns over and over and moving quickly in relationships, or at the very least trying to convince their partners that they DO want more at some point. His history is really making me question if it REALLY is just me that's the problem. \n\nAnyway, I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has any personal examples of narcs who deviated from the traditional pattern in some sense, but were still narcs.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Heres my story just a warning if you dont wanna read the description of what happened \n\nI was 20 and met a girl who drank a LOT. Before this weed was my drug of choice but when I met her I started binge drinking. I didnt know at the time I was an alcoholic. I ruined relationships. Anger issues that I learned to manage ten years before started popping up again. I was an ass hole, no doubt about it. And I pissed a lot of people off in that time.\n\n One group of people that I thought were my friends (I had known them since middle school, didnt really hang with them again until that the year this happened) happened to be some of the people I pissed off. I was obnoxious when I drank, and I was too dumb to even admit that. I thought I could trust them though. I didnt think they were capable of what they did to me.\n\nIt was like any other day. I was looking to get drunk as fuck and just have fun. I went over to my friends house and he had a bottle of liqour. (Ill make up names for this) it was johns house, John's girlfriend was there, along with our other friend Zak and his girlfriend, another friend Drew and this like 10 year old kid (john used to be hard into meth, the kids parents still were so he acted as a big brother to him). \n\nI arrived and John handed me a bottle of liquor and said to take a shot with every one at the house individually. I did, but only 1 or 2 other people took a shot with me. That should have been my first warning sign, but I had no reason not to trust these people. They were my friends, right?\n\nThat was about 5 shots in a row. I dont remember anything after that but im sure I drank a lot more. I blacked out. I woke up with a bloody nose. I literally fell onto my face HARD and busted up my face. There was a video of it.\n\nThen, I was told I was sexually assaulted. And it was recorded. And someone asked if I wanted to see. As if it was a joke, a funny prank. I couldn't bring myself to watch it. I wish I had sent it to the police, but 3 years later Im sure its long since been deleted.\n\nWhen I was unconscious, they put a condom on a beer bottle and raped me with it.\n\nIn the years since ive hung out with John and his girlfriend. Mostly when I was still smoking weed and drinking. Im sober from everything now and wonder why I ever even talked to them after what they did to me. He apologized. No one else did. Can an apology really make up for something so heinous?\n\nA mutual friend told me, \"yeah that night was so fucked up, they planned that shit before hand\"\n\nSo literally before I even arrived the plan was set in motion. I may have been a shitty person when I was in active addiction. But I didnt deserve that.\n\nIt's been 3 years now. It bothers me.

Also, I have a long history of trauma from sexual abuse as a child and sexual assaults as a teen/adult, and he is so amazing when it comes to any physical/sex stuff. He always asks for consent and is very receptive to anything I tell him to do or not do.  This is very important to me in a relationship. Overall, when we are together I feel like I\u2019m flying, like I\u2019m in heaven. I genuinely feel like he is \u201cthe one\u201d for me and I could see myself having children with him. There is another side of him though. For starters, nothing is ever his fault. He doesn\u2019t have much experience with dating, so I have to teach him some things (which I am totally okay with)! For example, we will go all work week without taking. I will voice how this bothers me and he turns it around on me, saying it\u2019s because of my anxious attachment style. Basically anytime I voice how I am hurt he says I am being too anxious, or how that\u2019s just how he is. We go a month without seeing each other and again, he just turns it on me and makes excuses upon excuses. We have taken breaks from talking twice before, so I know I can do it. Just for some reason this time is different because we have met each others parents and have seen eachother\u2019s childhood homes / hometowns (we met in college about 2 hours from our hometowns). It really seemed different this time. But doesn\u2019t it always seem like it\u2019s going to be different? The past 2 times we stopped talking I would go NC and he would call me crazy for not being able to stay friends on social media. I tried to explain that it just hurts too much to be reminded of him all the time and I need time apart, but he never understood and I felt very judged. Then a few months later, he would reach out and say how he realizes he doesn\u2019t want anyone else but me and he really wants to give us a chance and all this shit, and I ate it up every time. I have been with one NA before and successfully left him and have been NC for over a year now (although he still tries to reach out to my friends from time to time) and it feels great and I am completely over that relationship.

No sex, no alcohol, no abuse.  I do like him as a friend.  Right?\n\nWe had a nice time during the weekend.  He enjoyed meeting my cat.  We went out for food (which of course I bought because he has no job again - surprise?)  He helped me buy fans for the place because my A/C isn't working and he put them together.  He was the perfect gentleman in all regards - just like he used to be.\n\nAnd, just like he used to be, when we ate out, he had to let the waiter person know he \"worked in the back of the house for 25 years\" and so based on that \"complimented\" the food and server.  Then, of course, it was, \"do you know the joke of the day?\"  Then it was, \"Let me share a recipe that I think you all will enjoy, I went to another restaurant, xyz and they took as part of their future menu.\"  Etc.  Etc.  Just like always, showing off and ignoring me (not that I gave a damn, I know the need for attention and was really more viewing it as an observer of his narcissism, rather than caring how ignored I was).\n\nWhen he was getting ready to go back home, I had offered to buy his gas (of course).  So I rode with him in his car (which BTW, I gave him back when we were a couple because I didn't need it) to the gas station.  And he was so crazy, intense about the traffic and everything, he was back on \"high wire\".  He had to criticize my directions, \"I CAN'T turn left here, that is just not going to happen.  This street is far to busy, you should know that.\"  Then when I was filling up the gas, he observed that perhaps I wasn't doing something quickly enough and said, \"You know, I am just amazed.  You always seem so confused.  I just don't know how you make it through life.\"  HA HA.  Total gaslight behavior.  What an asshole.\n\nSo, he has gone home - an hour or more away.  And now I am getting texts, like, at least one a day.  \"Oh, let me share this piece of news with you, etc.\"  And I haven't had time to respond.  So tonight I get the love bomb hoover, \"I just want you to know how much I sincerely loved seeing you and meeting your cat.  It was so amazing to 'spend time around the campfire' watching movies with your adorable cat between us.  I just can't tell you how much it means.\"\n\nYep, the hoover on full swing.  And I recognize that I am such a soft person, I can actually feel sorry for him.  (BIG RED FLAG).  He doesn't have a job, and he misses me (right) and he doesn't have a dime to his name.  He is living rent free in the homeless place for veterans and living off of his former roommate.  I'm next.  I know that I am.\n\nYep, it was nice having him here.  Yes, we enjoyed ourselves.  Yes, fortunately I was on guard and am on guard to never love him again.  But now I have those nice red flags waving saying he is hoovering me back.  I didn't think he would in such an aggressive display.  And I know what I need to do and that is to go NC again.\n\nGod, I am so mad at myself.  I am too damn nice.

The person who committed the abuse is my closest cousin, who had been like a brother to me, and I don't know how to deal with this situation.\n\nSome context first: My family comes from Chiapas, a southern (and the poorest) state in Mexico, and the majority of them lives there. However, my dad, my sister and I (20yo) moved to a northern state some years ago. My mom did the same because she didn't want to be away from me and my sister (divorced parents) and lived there, in a different house, but same city, until last month. One year ago I went to study and live in Mexico City, so I don't see them regularly anymore. My cousin also lives and studies here.\n\nNow, when my sister talked about this, I didn't know what to do, I couldn't believe it and I felt like I was being broken in half. A part of me wanted to believe my sister, and the other wanted to believe my cousin, who obviously denied everything. But the thing is I am a survivor of abuse myself (nobody knows), so I decided to believe my sister and cut relationship with my cousin immediately.\n\nMy parents reacted in different ways: My dad believed my sister and, as far as I know, cut relationships with my cousin and I think all my mother's family too, but I'm not sure since we don't talk about it. On the other hand, my mom, though she said she believed my sister, seems to be on the side of my cousin, as the rest of his family (this includes my aunts, uncles, other cousins and my grandmother). Now, my mom and my sister have always had a complicated relationship since my sister is very rude and rebel while my mom is very sensitive and emotional, to the point she feels so unwanted and mistreated by my sister that she decided to go back to Chiapas with my grandmother a month ago... So now, she is in company of all the people close to my cousin.\n\nI guess that's enough for saying that I have a disfunctional family. \n\nNow, for an obvious reason that I now understand and some other way minor things, my sister has never liked my mother's family, so she doesn't even care about them, but the truth is that I love them and I do care about them. They have always been nothing buy nice to me. None of them have been bad to me ever, not even now that I cut relationship with my cousin, not even his parents or his brother. But they obviously keep in touch and hang with him whenever he goes to Chiapas to visit the family.\n\nI'd like to visit them too, specially now that my mom is back there because I know she feels bad for not being close to me and my sister. She has lived a rough life and I don't want to abandon her, but I don't want contact with my cousin either, and I just don't know how to keep in touch with my family without being around him (it would happen eventually), and I feel that, if I let him get close to me, I would be betraying my sister.\n\nIt's been hard to be away from my cousin because he has been there for me lots of times and he was a company to me, we used to play videogames online and hang out very often, but I guess that's the way it's gotta be, and I can deal with that. What I can't deal with is giving up half my family because of one person. I don't know what to do.\n\nI'm sorry if my English isn't correct in some parts, or if there's something ambiguous. I'll explain more details if you ask about them, because this story goes back to when I was a kid and I had to resume a lot. It would be nice to know if there's someone with a similar story.\n\nGood wishes for all.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

People stopped paying her way, her rides dried up, she became very limited in her actions.\n\nI began seeing a new woman, we're not intimate, but we spend time together and we post about our wholesome adventures on instagram. \n\nGuess who started following my companion's new instagram....\n\nFunny how that works out, my nex hated this woman with a fiery passion...and now she wants to follow her. \n\nI could respond and chase her off...but now we get into Sun Tzu's best quote.\n\n\"Never interfere when your enemy is destroying themselves.\"\n\nYou see, my nex is starting to creep back into my life whatever way she can. It means she didn't get what she wanted. They do this when they realize their supply they got post you...knows their shit. I've been told she has a black mark on her as a user and abuser...abrasive and not very nice. The smear campaign backfired because I didn't engage.\n\n\u201cThe supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.\u201d\n\nLet them destroy themselves and rebuild yourself. It's working wonders for me right now. I know she and I will meet on the field of battle soon...and she will be stupified by how horribly she failed to destroy me. I didn't even lift a finger to bring about her own failures.\n\nAnyway...buy a copy on Amazon. Apply Sun Tzu's teachings to your current struggle. Sun Tzu set me free and he's been dead for a few thousand years. \n\nWhen I secure the final victory, I'll light up the Cuban I've been saving.\n\nEdit: the final victory is not thinking of this woman again, and reaching a state where her actions no longer concern or affect me. Its a a long bloody war, you can see the war weary faces in the posts from everyone here. Some wars are short and sharp, some wars are of attrition.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Please don't judge me, I thought (and still think) it might have been my mind that is playing tricks on me.  I just felt so thankful to have discovered this sub. Although I don't have any friends who can support me I have started working on getting out of this relationship.\n\nSince then, in the last month, I sometimes feel almost as if I \"fell asleep\" again after my brief moment of awakening to what is going on. Then something happened again, but again I am not sure if I am dreaming or if it is true. The facts are simply that, facts. But the connection between the two facts is what makes my brain jump into loops and creating (?) explanations.\n\n\\- Last week we watched the movie \"American Psycho\" together. (Fact)\n\n(For anyone that doesn't know the movie, it's about a psychopath who goes on a murdering spree and gets away with it. There is a scene were the main character has a lock of hair from one of his female victims.)\n\n\\- Yesterday I noticed that I am missing a lock of hair. (Fact)\n\nat about the height of my temple, hidden under my mess of a head of hair there is a portion of hair missing. It is not a lot. But enough for me to stare at myself in shock, investigating and washing and brushing my hair repeatedly, trying to understand how it is possible that this has happened - I cut my own hair from time to time but I have never taken a scissor and cut any of my hair off at the root, as would appear to have happened.\n\nWhile these two facts are facts, the connection between these two facts is what I struggle with because it is based on conjecture; How do I know that I didn't accidentally do this to myself during the last time I was cutting my hair?\n\nBecause I don't really have anyone I can confide in or speak to, I (maybe this was stupid of me) just straight-up asked him if he had cut my hair while I was sleeping.\n\n\"What? No! Why would I do that?!\"\n\n\"I have no idea\" - and I really genuinely have no idea why anybody would do such a thing so I didn't really know what to say apart from the truth.\n\n\"Then why do you ask me?\"\n\nI explained because I am missing a lock of hair and it has been cut off in a straight line, from close to my scalp and I haven't been seeing anyone but him and myself; he then told me, to which I honestly cannot even argue,\n\n\"Why would I cut a tiny lock of hair from the side of your head? If I *were* to do that then I'd either shave your entire head or do it in a way that you don't notice.\"\n\nAnd in a way, he is right. Why would anybody do that ? I am so confused. The facts are just that, facts. But the connection between these facts, between watching the movie and missing a lock of hair is something I have no evidence for, just plain conjecture. I don't know if someone cut it from my head intentionally. I don't know if I cut it from my head, unintentionally. I don't know if my brain is making up weird things. I know that these hair are gone. But I don't know how.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - watched movie \"American Psycho\" with my Narc partner and yesterday I noticed I'm missing a lock of hair which appears to have been cut from my head. My brain is failing.\n\nEDIT - UPDATE :\n\n7/26 Last night he came over (but didn't stay) and right before he left my apartment; he said, in a joking manner, \"next time I come over I should bring some sleeping powder and put it in your drink to help you relax! XD \" immediately followed by the words \"No, I'm just joking. I would never do that.\" \n\nAt this point, the facts, reading your replies and assessing the situation I have decided to travel back to my home country. I have a holiday from work coming up at the beginning of August and I will use the time to travel back and see my family. Thank you for your support.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Before we had rights, women and children were the property of men. Men could do with us whatever they pleased, whenever they pleased. This included all forms of abuses: sexual, physical and emotional. Having no rights, we were groomed to be compliant, to obey, to serve, to not speak up, to not have a voice, and generally be an extension of the man. Both church and state enabled and didn\u2019t interfere with this paradigm.\n\nThere were start and stop efforts, but the abuse laws did not really gain \u201cteeth\u201d until around the middle to late \u00a020th century. Around this time, money was allocated to professionals and agencies to identify abuse, educate people about abuse, and begin to enforce the laws which made it illegal. It would be nice if once a law was passed, it would be obeyed, but as we can see almost a century later that is not the case. We still have large systems (e.g. Catholic Church and military) where they are allowed to \u201ctake care of their own\u201d and thus these systems just enable the abuse to continue.\n\n## Belief Systems\n\nSome of the belief systems that must be changed and challenged are:\n\n1. I own you. I can sexually, physically, and emotionally abuse you. I am the stronger sex so I can overpower you and I will.\n2. What I do in my home with my property is my business. This is a private matter and I don\u2019t have to discuss it with anyone.\n3. If I get into trouble for what I am doing it is not my fault. I will take it out on and blame you. (In Malaysia, if a man is arrested for a DUI, his wife may go to jail as well regardless of where she was at the time of the offense. Part of the paradigm that women are fighting.)\n4. There are still countries that do not have strong laws to protect women and children. This fact enables men\u2019s belief that \u201cI own you.\u201d It takes years to give laws \u201cteeth\u201d and change the belief system \u201cI own you\u201d.\n\n## The Challenges\n\nIf I have been able to control all the people around me, and I sense someone is going to take that control away, guess what I am going to do? If I am not ready to give up, I am going to *fight*!\n\nAgain take a look at the Catholic Church, a system which has maintained severe inconsistency in addressing this pervasive issue.\u00a0 It is a system which continues to \u201cfight\u201d to take care of its own, and in doing so enables them to commit abuse. \u00a0In this day and age no system should be above the law, and abuse should be tried by a judicial system. Why is this distinction important? This is the power of denial, enabling, and control that all those abused have to have the courage to confront.\n\nAnother challenge the abused will face is \u201call fingers pointing in their direction\u201d:\n\n1. Why now, why not then?\n2. Why didn\u2019t you fight back?\n3. Oh, look we found this in your life-you are not perfect, so we are not sure about you.\n4. You are not credible\n5. You don\u2019t look the way I think you should look\n6. Why did you continue to be there?\n\nThe doubting questioners continue. They represent the history of denying and enabling. They enable the paradigm of abuse was legal. They forget sexual and physical abuse are illegal now!\n\n## Codependency\n\nNow let\u2019s look at the phenomenon of codependency. \u00a0We are going to stick with our understanding of codependency as a system of distortions that exists on a continuum. Codependents learn personality traits that interfere with knowing one\u2019s self and others. The people pleasing aspect of codependency might drive the ignoring of who we are trying to please. The focus of wanting others approval may keep us from acknowledging there might be abusive behavior coming from the person whose approval we want.\n\nThe need for harmony might prevent us from realizing we may be enabling abusive behavior. Or any combination of the above.\u00a0 We don\u2019t have the tools to deal with abusive behavior, so this also drives us to avoid bringing it to consciousness. And we probably have a history of being abused or exploited so it feels familiar. We add these traits to our history of being property which taught us to be compliant, obey, no rights, no voice, serve, be the extension of the man and we are completely groomed and ready for sexual abuse.\n\n## #MeToo\n\nThe #MeToo movement has given the abused strength in numbers, solidarity, an energy to join, an awakening, and so much more. Having the right to say \u201cNo\u201d is not enough. As you can see from the history of denial and enabling, no one is going to thank you when you say, \u201cStop Now\u201d or \u201cWhat you did to me is wrong\u201d. The only thanks you might get is from another abused person who may borrow your courage to find her own.\n\nEvery step of the way, it is so important to remember the denial and enabling sludge you will be fighting (some may be from women stuck in the denial and enabling sludge). We are changing one of life\u2019s major paradigms: we are changing the ethos from\u00a0*\u201cI can do whatever I want to you\u201d* to *\u201cNo, you can\u2019t! It\u2019s my body and I have rights now!\u201d*\n\nThose who like the old paradigm may get vicious. Changing this paradigm is going to take generations. There are many who will go to their grave holding on to their right to abuse others. Once you are free from them, focus on educating and being with those who honor everyone\u2019s rights.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***\u201cWhenever one person stands up and says,\u2019 Wait a minute, this is wrong\u2019 it helps other people do the same.\u201d \\~Gloria Steinem***\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn Part Two we will give you tools to live in the new paradigm. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis article originally appeared at Recovery(dot)org\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u00a9 2019 Dr. Anne Brown, Author and Narrator of \"Backbone Power The Science of Saying No\" eBook &amp; audiobook available at Amazon and Backbone Power website.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Author's Bio*\n\nDr. Anne Brown PhD, RN CS, is a psychotherapist, author, speaker, coach living in Sausalito, California.

Women, along with children, were property of men. Men could abuse us with no consequences. We also discussed codependency and what it means as it relates to our discussion here. \u00a0We are going to stick with our understanding of codependency as a system of distortions that exists on a continuum. Codependents learn personality traits that interfere with knowing one\u2019s self and others. The people pleasing aspect of codependency might drive the ignoring of who we are trying to please.\n\nThe focus of wanting others approval may keep us from acknowledging there might be abusive behavior coming from the person whose approval we want. The need for harmony might prevent us from realizing we may be enabling abusive behavior. Or any combination of the above. We don\u2019t have the tools to deal with abusive behavior, so this also drives us to avoid bringing it to consciousness. And we probably have a history of being abused or exploited so it feels familiar. We add these traits to our history of being property which taught us to be compliant, obey, no rights, no voice, serve, be the extension of the man and we are completely groomed and ready for [sexual abuse](https://www.recovery.org/drug-treatment/inpatient-sexual-abuse/).\n\n## Consequences of These Two Paradigms!\n\n1. Compliance\n2. Service to Abusers\n3. No voice\n4. No Rights\n5. Endure Abuse\n6. Poor self-esteem\n7. Please others at all cost\n\nHow do we live once we are away from the abuse? The above coping skills for life are certainly not going to help us live a life of self-respect and dignity.\n\nWhen I get upset about the state of the world, the amount of injustices we are seeing, the extent of abuse, the bullying, people dying from addictions caused by greed, I go into my wave my magic wand world. I would like to have the power to:\n\n1. Eliminate all bullying-any time someone tried to bully they would receive an electric shock.\n2. Anyone who was about to be sexually (or physically) abused would be taught to Scream No and Slap the person hard across the face. The slap would be the universal signal for the troops/other women to come in and assist.\n3. Anytime someone was about to ingest a toxic substance it would turn into a delicious Kale salad.\n4. Anytime a child was about to be hurt- a guardian angel/hero would come into protect the child.\n5. Anytime someone was about to get money from stepping on another person\u2019s face/soul/being, the money would magically go back where it belonged.\n\nI could go on and on, but let\u2019s see what we can do to regain our dignity.\n\n## New Tools for Safe Situations\n\nI think we can do part of one of my dreams. We can all learn to yell loudly \u201c*Stop*\u201d if someone starts to touch us inappropriately without our permission in a crowded situation. If someone sexually touches you in a store, on a plane, on the sidewalk, at a party, at work, or anywhere you might not want to cause a scene, cause the scene and take care of yourself. Use \u201cStop, what are you doing?\u201d or \u201cHey, what was that?\u201d. Our compliant self will try to deny it is happening and not want to make a scene. Don\u2019t let your compliant self win!\n\nWe all need to train our bodies to react with a No Stop rather than shock and disbelief. So many women have said they just got quiet and were paralyzed rather than fight back. I know this only too well as I became paralyzed when someone stole my purse off my shoulder. I held on and was dragged for a bit across a snowy wet parking lot. This resulted in me having a very black eye. Fortunately, I had a friend standing there who could tell me what happened as I still have no memory of the incident. I chose amnesia and paralysis. We have years of \u201cdon\u2019t rock the boat\u201d which need to be changed to \u201cStop or No!\u201d\n\nSpeak up! Hopefully, adults in charge of young vulnerable women who are training to represent their country will make sure the young women are never left in the presence of a man who can take advantage of his power. Hopefully, these adults will listen when the young women speak up, believe them and take action. We need to teach our children, if it doesn\u2019t feel right, if something feels icky speak up and go to your parents, any adult who will listen and take action. Do not let some enabling adult be silent as a response or worse not believe you. Keep searching out an adult who will listen, believe you and take action.\n\nSpeak out! Part of the brainwashing of sexual predators is to threaten to harm you, your family or anyone \ud83d\udcf7you know. Speak up to someone who can make the situation safe for all of you. Speak up to someone who has the power to take you away from the abuser. As adults or parents, look for signs of trauma in your children. Ask questions: \u201cWhy is your hair wet? Why were you taking a shower with your coach?\u201d Hopefully, you will stop any abusive behavior before it starts, but speak up to someone who can safely take you from the situation.\n\nAsk for what you need! Obviously, coming from the Codependent/Women\u2019s discourse of compliance, this is a new concept. We need to start with how do I feel about this and what do I need? Many people feel they need to be perfect to make requests-Not true!\n\nMany people feel it is selfish to take care of yourself by asking for what you need-Not true! Because you were born and live in this country you ought to be able to ask for what you need to take care of yourself!\n\n## Moving Forward\n\nWe have just touched on a few tools for moving forward. These tools are simple but powerful. Once you practice with a friend to say \u201cStop/What are you doing?/Don\u2019t do that!,\u201d you will find all the messages coming up which have prevented you from saying \u201cStop.\u201d\n\nAfter you have done that for a while begin to practice making requests. Sit with a friend, in a group and ask for something e.g. a ride to market, can you get me a glass of water etc. Start with the easy requests. Your friend can say yes or no which should have no effect on your ability to continue to make requests. Keep doing the exercise until your body is modified to accept a yes, I can do that, or No I can\u2019t do that.\n\nThese two powerful exercises can help you retrain your body to stop being groomed to be compliant and move into \u201cNo that doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d And by the way here is what I need! The #MeToo movement teaches us we have the power to change the world as a group. Let\u2019s join together and do it!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n \n\nThis article originally appeared at Recovery(dot)org\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*\u00a9 2019 Dr. Anne Brown, Author and Narrator of \"Backbone Power The Science of Saying No\" eBook &amp; audiobook available at Amazon and Backbone Power website.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Author's Bio*\n\nDr. Anne Brown PhD, RN CS, is a psychotherapist, author, speaker, coach living in Sausalito, California.

Sorry for the text dump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a 20 years old college student, currently staying at my family's home for the summer. My parents divorced years ago because my father found out that my mother was cheating on him. My father was away a lot and my mother had many boyfriends. Growing up, I had to go with my mother whenever she would meet with the latest boyfriend she had. I was pretty young so I didn't understand what was going on. Eventually, I figured out what was transpiring and I threatened to tell my father when he returned. In retaliation, my mother began emotionally and physically abusing me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince she came from an south-east asian background, she began punishing me with the type of punishments that she herself experienced. However, I always thought that they were cruel in nature. I wasn't allowed to sleep and, instead, had to stand still and firm all night in her room, while she herself slept. I realized that she probably wouldn't know if I closed my eyes but she was a light sleeper and terrified me endlessly. I had to kneel on the kitchen floor, on top of rice, with my arms stretched out in a christ-like manner, with books hanging on to my arms with rope. I had to kneel in that position for at least five hours or her fancying. If I lowered them, she would add two more hours. Alternatively, she would grab my head and hurt me that way. She would bash my head against the wall or try to gouge my eyes with her manicured nails or rip my hair out. Those were the most common punishments. Whenever I was done being punished, she would ask me if I was going to tell my father. If I did anything indicating I would tell him, she would hurt me more. After a while, I learned to just shut up and keep quiet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis went on for years and whenever I had the guts to face her, I was shutdown by her. This behavior would grow and grow whenever I did something wrong, so I hated being at my house. If I did something wrong or upset her, she would punish me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeyond that, my mother developed a habit of just lazing about on the couch with her ipad. The only thing she would do is her shitty MLM business (can you guess which one it was?). She'd watch her sappy soap dramas and chat with men on her various dating websites. Meanwhile, I had to learn how to cook and clean and fend myself. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have had breakfast or dinner. Cleaning the entire house everyday was a 'chore' that I had to do, never her. Her duties were house arranging like putting up a picture or putting flowers. You know, things you only needed to do once. The saddest thing was that my mother honestly thought that every man she met loved her and would marry her and take her away to paradise. Then she would cry her eyes out when it was revealed that they were only using her for sex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor years, I learned to stay out of my parents way and keep my mouth shut. I didn't care for anything and stayed overtime at school, so I wouldn't have to go home. I did very well as a result, but never socialized with people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEventually, my father found out and they divorced. After many nights of yelling and fighting, my father earned custody and I was so happy. Because he was always away, we never really connected father to son. However, he took an interest in me and started coaching me on my academics. For the next couple of years, it was intensive study, something that I excelled in quite well. He wanted me to be a doctor so I would memorizing anatomy and the like throughout high school. Our dinners would be quizzes about medical terminology and concepts. I got into Stanford on medical scholarships and personal saved up money and he was so proud.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFlash forward to this summer. I return home to learn that my father allows my mother to live with our family because she wanted to see me and my siblings and be the mother she always wanted to be. I, foolishly, allowed it because I felt like she had changed. She seemed more compassionate so I never brought up the past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen, I learned that the way she saw things she was only disciplining me because I was so stubborn as a child. That made me snap and I yelled at her, calling her a 'lying whore', that I wanted to 'bash her head in with a hammer', that 'I wanted to discipline her within an inch of her life'. I don't know what came over me but all the resentment and anger I had as a child burst out and I had to be restrained by my father from her (she was crying that I was being ungrateful, that she had given birth to me, and that I was being stubborn).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI immediately demanded my father to kick her out of the house, but he refused. He said that he needed her here because she pays well. I got into an argument with him and he claimed that I was being ungrateful to him. After arguing some more, I've found that my father only cares that I become a doctor because he never got the chance to. He screwed up a lot of his prospective when he was younger and lives a low-end office job, which explains their monetary relationship. Regardless, I feel so betrayed, angry, and lost. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. My father refuses to bring up the issue and my mother won't leave the house. Furthermore, I feel such intensive anger and thirst for revenge against my mother. It brings out the worst in me but I feel so happy when I think of harming or killing her. Logically, I understand that I have anger issues on the topic that I should not act on(I'm usually a calm person in any other situation), but emotionally, I want revenge.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntldr; mother abused me into not telling my father about her infidelity. Learned to shut my mouth. Father finds out and divorces her. Years later, learn that she is being accepted back by my father and she denies that the abuse ever happened.

I need emotional support, immediate family will not support me.", "author": "Lilxpie", "self_text": "I don't really know where to begin, there's a whole lot of stuff that i've gone through, especially over the past few months when I decided to take a break from study after I graduated, it's just a big shit hole of a time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy dad and brother are both mentally unstable and I don't have anywhere else to go to live in, It's really affecting me mentally. The house is usually quiet and lonely. I don't talk to my brother or dad ever because of all these situations building up its just better for me mentally do to my own thing. My immediate family pretty much never talks to me now. (since my birthday last month) My brother and dad are obviously closer to each other. During my period of doing my own thing, they went out to have dinner without me a few times. I don't have the finances to move out, no job, little to none financial support. It pretty much makes me want to cry whenever I hear them walk around the house doing things or hear their voices.  I use to want them to change but now i've come to the conclusion that they're not going to change and I just need to remove myself from the house but I can't just up and leave. I have the freedom yet I feel trapped in the house where i'm meant to feel some form of support and safety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been through so many situations where my brother will constantly get angry at me because I won't let him use my things (shampoo, conditioner), or give him my money to use so he can buy drinks. Whenever he doesn't get what he wants he gets even more angry and i've learned over time to just walk away from it because I don't have the mental energy to deal with his behaviour anymore. My brother has bipolar, he acts out so much because my dad is not hard enough on restricting him. He buys him smokes, alcohol, lets him drink and smoke as much as he wants in easy access around the house. (He actually smokes outside thank god) and I don't think he's seen a health professional in a while. He doesn't have a job, I don't have a job, so i'm just stunned that he asks me for money and assumes that I'm going to give him money when we are both in the same position. Lately he's been disrespecting me and just ignoring me and continuing doing things when I tell him to stop. (I was recording a dance the other day, he opened the door and I asked if he could wait a few more minutes till i'm done, then he can come outside to smoke. He completely ignored me and just started smoking right around where I was recording. I hate the smell of the smoke, i've had problems in the past where my mum wouldn't respect the space and smoke inside and the smell would get to my room so it really brought back those memories and made me wonder why does my brother think he can get away with this bullshit) He's also been claiming food in the house all because I won't let him borrow my things or give him money, and he's not the one buying the groceries so he can't claim them as his. My brother use to get really upset if i've packed the dishes away wrong, put the laundry on the wrong setting, had my underwear drying in the bathroom because of period stuff (obviously freshly cleaned) so that has a lot to do with me just doing my own things that way he can do things his way and I can do things my way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith dad he's just emotionally unavailable, passive aggressive, sarcastic, will not take me seriously, ignores me, alcoholic. Whenever we've talked 90% of the time he turns it into an argument. Dad always has to be right otherwise i'll get lectured for half an hour on the same subject where I cannot run away. He's threatened to kick me out many times just because i've been upset and angry but never follows through with it. (He makes a lot of threats like that, where they don't hold out because he just forgets or doesn't care) When I try to bring up situations like my brother being upset at me to dad, he just tells me that we have to work things out as adults and talk to each other. Dad is literally being lazy because my brother won't be an adult about situations because he's mentally not ok at the moment. There was a situation that happened on my birthday last month where dad got angry at me while I was live streaming because I didn't come open the door for him immediately, but he never called or texted anybody to come let him in so he just took it out on me. He also wouldn't shut up and go away when I told him that I was talking to my friends on a live stream, I kept saying we can talk about this later, i'm live streaming right now and my friends can hear you, he kept going off. I wouldn't be as hurt usually, but on my 21st birthday... That's real low. He would always claim the situation wasn't as bad as it was, he has valid reasons to get upset at me on my birthday over something that wasn't my problem, be too tired to talk about the situation, then minutes later blasts hardbass music and drinks late at night. Related to finances, I sadly have to rely on him for finances until I magically find a job somehow... After my birthday incident I started avoiding my family, and working on my own cooking, dishes, laundry, ect. But I was relying on my birthday money just to live, buy products I needed, and spend time with friends. Usually dad would give me a little money every week, but because of this incident he went a whole month without giving me any money. I have to go up to him and ask for something. I know such a first world problem, go get a job you say... I've tried to get government money but I cannot for 2 reasons. Dad will not share his financial information when i've tried to give him forms to fill out. And Dad earns a lot of money, he earns over the threshold which means I cannot get money because the government assumes my dad will gladly financially support me. I've been trying to find my first job ever since my teens and its really sucked hard. Dad will tell me to go get a job but not offer any ways to help me for interviews, not offer to buy me appropriate clothes for interviews, not help me at all, just assume that I can just up and get a job with no experience. (this is why I use my own money to by myself things because dad won't invest in it)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause my dad never talks to me ever (and now my brother never talks to me ever) I'm just so stuck. There's no support in the house, I cannot stay here forever. I want to leave but I do not have the finances and I don't feel mentally prepared to leave. A few friends know about my situation for a while, One of my family members is aware that my brother hasn't been acting good but doesn't know much about dad stuff. (We haven't talked about it since a few months ago where more stuff has happened like my birthday incident) She's really been encouraging me to head straight into uni and I don't know if that's the best thing for me mentally at the moment.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I disagreed... My first mistake. \"oh so I can't do that but it's OK for you to slap me whenever I say something to you that you don't like?\" I had smacked him on the arm a month or so ago in a joking manner, a little harder than intended.

I'm 1/4 covered so I tug the blanket back over  me, he's somehow tucked it under him, so I yank a bit harder... My third mistake. \"F*ck you're f*cking ignorant sometimes\" \"I just needed to cover myself\" \"you're f*cking ignorant\" insert f-bombs on both ends and cut to me sleeping on the couch, in tears again. \n\nI felt it.

My partner is always concerned about presenting the best version of himself to the world that he can. He likes others to be envious of his life. With time that extended to me. Dressing different, losing weight, etc. In fact, I am not even allowed to eat things he deems junk food or unnecessary even on special occasions like holidays or birthdays. If he thinks I've gotten heavier than I previously was he calls me fat, chunky, a fat cat, anything he can to get his point across. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe isolated me from all my friends to the point I have no one to talk to. The few friends I have are over text. A few months ago he saw where I was texting male friends of mine I have had for years, and ever since then, he monitors my cell phone activity. I came home from work one day to him saying, \" Why did you text \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*?\" my answer that they were a good friend and I didn't want to not respond to them and be rude apparently wasn't a good reason. He then told me that he was smarter than I am and because of his profession he will know everything I do when I do it. I was terrified. I broke all of my devices ( Ipad, apple watch, etc) just so I could feel a little safer. He has also guilted me and kept me from seeing my family some as well. Lately, he has started getting in my face saying I hate him, I'm going to leave him, I cant wait to get away from him, and other things of the sort. I haven't given him any reason to say those things to me and the anger and malice he says it with are very hurtful. Many other things have happened that I just can't get together in my head right now \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n This past weekend my mother and her 13-year-old Shih Tzu came over because her air conditioner was broken and it was over 100 degrees outside. You would've thought someone had just shot him by the scene he created. He refused to talk to anyone, sulked upstairs, only came down for meals (which I have to make his plate and clean up after him) . We all know he doesn't care for dogs, but my mother's dog is old, well behaved, and stayed in the guest room with my disabled mother most of the day. At one point in one of his rare moments downstairs while my mother was upstairs he had one of his anger explosions. He began kicking things around the room, shouting and screaming that no one listens to him. Saying he was in charge of his own house, that I will listen to him or leave. At one point he did break up with me saying that all he wanted was someone to listen to him. I tried to stay calm and only told him not to point his finger in my face. When I went to go upstairs to wake my mother and gather my things he came and restrained me and told me to go sit down on the couch. When he finally got me over there he told me that it was all over the dog and that if the dog was not gone by the time he got home from work the next day, then it would not be good. I understand not liking animals, but that was just very extreme in my eyes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n   He won't go to counseling or talk to anybody. In fact, he claims I am his only friend or person he can talk to. I know I am not perfect in his relationship, but am I wrong in seeing a problem with his behavior? I heard my mother on the phone with my father telling him my partner was mean and sadistic and that made me think of all the things that happened over the years. If I were to leave, I don't even know how I would go about that. We've been together a long time, lie together, have plans. Through all of this, I don't know if its abuse or not. I guess I'm just wondering if any of this is alarming behavior or if im being crazy. If you have read all of this thank you. I needed to get it out of my head.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

For a long time I didn\u2019t see it that way, and still struggle to reconcile what happened to me with being an abuse survivor because I was madly in love with him. I didn\u2019t really understand what gay meant then (I went to a catholic school), just that when I saw him he made me happy and I wanted to make him happy. I was a bright student with disinterested parents, very little encouragement at home, and mum was a drinker. He took me under his wing, tutored me and made me feel very special. It is still hard for me to accept this for what it was: grooming. Many of the things he taught me with meant that I actually believed I could go to university and achieve (which I ultimately did). It is this that really fucks me up. It\u2019s like what I went through was the price of success. From the outside I look like a successful person, I run my own business, have paid off most of my house (I\u2019m 37 for the record) but I am not. I am broken inside. I have attempted suicide three times, had substance abuse problems, gambling addictions and self harm. The worst is that I can\u2019t have relationships with people. Sex is hard, I had a bad flashback with my last boyfriend and haven\u2019t been in a relationship since (that was 8 years ago) and I am scared of having penetrative sex. I am lonely, often afraid, and have dissociate myself from all of my other feelings so live in an emotional void. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I have had 20yrs of psychologists and really don\u2019t think there is much more they can do for me. And what makes me feel worse is that I still have love for the man who did this to me. I know that is totally contradictory (insane!) and living in that in-between reality of not trusting my own emotions also makes me hate him. The tug-of-war in my brain makes me want to throw myself down the stairs. I need to forgive him or prosecute him but I can\u2019t do either, so end up punishing myself in stead. How fucked up is that. Sometimes I wish I could just erase my brain like a computer and reboot. I just needed to vent this all. I hope I haven\u2019t caused anyone in a similar position distress, I know it\u2019s selfish to do this. Honestly, I don\u2019t see any other solution than building up enough money so that when I finally give in my family won\u2019t hate me so much coz at least their mortgage will be paid and I will have achieved something for them. I need new hope but my well is dry. I can\u2019t even cry about any of this, I am just empty inside. Sorry reddit for being such a downer.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He waits until I\u2019m ready. \n\nBut even so, even with how great he is, I\u2019m always worried he\u2019s lying to me about anything and everything. It\u2019s constant and it\u2019s exhausting. He hasn\u2019t shown any signs of being a narc but I almost feel like I don\u2019t trust myself enough to be a proper judge of it. After all I was fooled for 6 years. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m waiting for him to finally show me that he\u2019s just like my Nex and it feels bad. \n\nEven at work I just feel like everyone is being fake nice and no one likes me or cares about me. It\u2019s just all lies. I\u2019ve never been so depressed and anxious in my life.\n\nHow do you even begin with counseling or therapy? What kind of person specializes in stuff like this?

Everything starts simple. It was all so simple until our friendship became focused around problems and only problems. I always think it\u2019s so silly. Nothing ever happened between us but somehow it felt like we were almost to the point of being in a relationship. We never had a point where everything was OK and we could just genuinely enjoy life as friends. I always saw you as a nice guy who just needed some compassion and patience. Looking back makes me so angry at how I didn\u2019t leave. I kept thinking I could save you or help you. I guess that brings to light my own codependency issues but that doesn\u2019t shade away all the manipulation. I\u2019m gonna be honest, I don\u2019t know how you did it. I don\u2019t even want to know how you manipulated me so easily. Somehow you made me feel responsible for you and I would utterly destroy myself every single time something bad happened to you. Maybe I\u2019m just easily to manipulate. That\u2019s my own fault. I am so oblivious I just want to think everyone is good.

I have so many other people in my life but no other made me feel this shitty. You made me feel special in a way. I was afraid to leave, afraid to hurt you and afraid what you would do to yourself. The problem in my life is clear. It is you. Somehow you bring out the worst in me, but I am glad I\u2019ve learned some toxic traits that I have. Starting today I choose to improve myself and only improve. I refuse to look back. I am going to go offline and eventually cut you entirely out my life.

It gets you off when people give you attention. Everything in life requires balance and clearly you have no sense of balance. \n\n\nI can only change myself. I enjoy helping people. It\u2019s just how I am, but I refuse to let someone like you just use me over and over again. Call me delusional, I clearly have some serious issues myself.

Our relationship dynamics hadn\u2019t changed at all without the title, and I was blindly loyal to him. He didn\u2019t change anything during that time- he got worse. \n\nWhen I got into that new relationship, my nex lost it. Like mental breakdown lost it, Full self destruct mode in total disbelief I found someone new &amp; moved on \u201cso quickly\u201d (it had been 8 months of other women and verbal abuse, while promising me change to string me along). I continued talking to my nex during that relationship, and he alternated between love bombing, giving me all kinds of attention,  and verbally abusing me, reminding me that nothing he did could bother me- I had a bf after all- if I caught him doing something. I was honest with my nex about still being \u201cin love\u201d with him and eventually told him I\u2019d leave my bf if he\u2019d change. He did nothing to try to get me back or prove anything to me. When I\u2019d go no contact he would crawl back wanting to right his wrongs within a couple days, while still talking to other women. Wash rinse repeat.

He reminded me that any lies he told or things he did during that time didn\u2019t matter, because I\u2019d just had a whole boyfriend I was having sex with. He ultimately re-discarded me the week I was moving, telling me he had a third date with someone &amp; since  I was moving he wouldn\u2019t do distance anyway.

He accompanied me through that previous abusive relationship telling me how shitty my partner was. Getting close to me while I was in a relationship to just plant the seeds of doubt in me was the first Narcissistic move he did, I think. One point for him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBack to the password thing: While just messing around in his fb page (typing up those \"hahaha you've been hacked! xD\" statuses), I saw a notification pop up. I clicked the red 1 and see that it was alerting him that someone he had followed (or to be specific, marked as a close friend or \"starred\") had posted a status. Then shared a picture. I saw the name and it coincided with the name of an ex of his. Like all Narcs, he had his fair share of \"horrible exes\" who all allegedly cheated on him and broke his heart. Early into our relationship he spilled so much information about the nature of these \"relationships\" and I sympathized with him to an extent and gained a sense of dislike towards them, but one ex in particular stood out: the one who \"used him like a toy\": Jove. For days he'd share tidbits about his relationship with her, sometimes delving into more uncomfortable tidbits like how sexual they got or where he took her to dates. Understandably I got a bit jealous, but when I would communicate to him that these talks made me uncomfortable, he would go \"Why are you getting upset at me for something I did with her? You're blowing things out of proportion.\". In a sense...he was right, I thought at the time. I kept Jove in mind though since she was brought up so much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis person who he followed on FB in order to track her every move was in fact Jove, so as the bombardment of alerts kept coming by, I felt hurt. I did a dumb thing and began scouring his fb wall and messages to see if there was any interactions between the two that I didn't know about and found some messages they were having. One message stood out from nex to her that was sent merely days after him and I went exclusive: \"Here...I thought this fit us really well...\" with a link to the song \"Somebody That I Used To Know\" and a post after that saying \"I really miss us\" . I brought it up later to him and asked him why he was following her despite constantly telling me that she was a terrible person and that she hurt him so much, and this is where I beat myself up about it: He lied. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe told me probably the laziest excuse ever. \"Oh, I must have followed her by accident..I was trying to follow you but I accidentally clicked on her...and you're making a big deal out of this?\" What did I do? I felt a gut feeling! Something in me almost yelling out \"this is a bunch of bs\", but because he had \"saved\" me from my previous relationship and love bombed me so much, I was afraid of being alone. I needed him. I ate up the lie and thought I was overreacting. After that is a bit fuzzy. I could remember a later incident where he would comment on another ex's pictures every time she posted them and he said \"Man, I remember the stuff we used to do on that bed...\" when she posted a pic in her room. I was told it was an \"innocent comment\" and that again, I was making a big deal. I would've listed more things that happened early in the relationship, but the incidents and abuse I got a year or so later up until 2017 eclipses them so much. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI really hate this leftover feeling that I \"deserved\" the abuse I later got because of this. I ate up lie after lie and he kept pushing more and more boundaries for years until I ended up discarded and broken. Thankfully I'm doing much better now, but it's memories like these that really make me question whether or not this could have been avoided...had I been less needy and insecure. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I recall a bad memory with my nex that happened early on in the relationship. Said memory involves him still maintaining a line of communication with an ex to talk about how he misses their relationship and it's probably the earliest red flag and precursor to what was to come that I foolishly ignored. Years later I feel guilty about letting these red flags slide.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

They responded by saying \u201csorry you think that way\u201d blocking me, and slandering me to all our mutual friends. It feels like I made the right decision. Thank you all.\n\nHi everyone, I just wanted to start by apologizing \u2014 I know this board is intended for the abused, and not the abuser... But ever since my friend confronted me about this, it\u2019s been eating me up inside, and I need to change. I thought that this board may be able to still help. If there is a board specific to the former abusers in relationships, please let me know. Thank you so much. This story is way too long, but I just don\u2019t know what I should say \u2014 this is still kinda recent for me so it\u2019s hard to emotionally detach myself from it...\n\n____________________\nThis all is basically just venting and fluff, I don\u2019t really expect anyone to read it.\n\n\nTo give a little bit of background, I\u2019m a 19 year old girl who only really has online friends, the closest of which is the one I have hurt. He came into my life when I was ready to kill myself over university and showed me that it was okay to be happy again. He would always listen and be so kind, and I returned his affection twice over. It wasn\u2019t long before we began showering eachother in compliments and encouraging statements. We\u2019d play video games for hours and hours on end, talking into the night and loving every second of it. I had always tried my best to be supportive and always let him know that things will be okay, there\u2019s always a path out of the darkness, and that I\u2019ll always be there if they need me, and while this pledge was not formally returned, they certainly helped me as much as they could. If this was all, I\u2019m sure we would have kept being friends for a very long time, and maybe even turn our open playful flirting into a real relationship...\n\nThere are a couple spots, as memory serves, where we had any disagreements at all, and even then we\u2019d be fairly understanding. Their political opinions were strong and dehumanizing sometimes, so I would get very upset at them sometimes... I think this is where my abusive behavior must have started. There are a few situations I left out for some amount of brevity.\n\nAnother moment like this is when they sent me a dick picture because they were really excited and happy that they were capable of getting erections again... and I decided to run my mouth at them for that, too. Unconsciously \u2014 I had completely discounted their statement and began criticizing them because I was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d After this they started to call me out a bit... they assertively explained themselves and said how it \u201cwasn\u2019t even meant for me. It was meant for someone else. I just thought you\u2019d appreciate it, but I guess I was wrong.\u201d And later, when I asked to cancel an online meeting we had planned that night \u201cSo this is it then? You\u2019re just going to push me out of your life. Fine, I\u2019ve lived with an abusive ex long enough to know where this is going.\u201d And yet, despite me, my friend continued to talk to me after that.\n\nHowever, after this point, our conversations became a lot more sexual than I was comfortable with, which included my friend talking about how me cutting myself made them horny and that I should keep cutting myself and sending them pictures of it. Which I apprehensively went along with as best I could. Notably they also started misgendering me more (I\u2019m trans) after this point, which I suppose was their way of pushing me to change my ways, which I ignored. \n\nOur relationship continued normally for a long time after this, and one night of particularly wonderful intimacy, I confessed that I loved them. They responded very respectfully that they don\u2019t love me \u2014 because they can\u2019t love anyone due to memories of their abusive ex.\n\nAfter a long time had passed, and we had many discussions about how we don\u2019t have a romantic future, I thought it was going to be okay if I talked to other people or tried to make more friends. This disgusting thought ended up ruining our friendship. As I ended up making another online friend coincidentally a bit later while watching a stream, and we really hit it off. It wasn\u2019t long before we were flirting and were having lots of fun.\n\nMy twisted mind thought I was just sharing something that made me happy, but I was basically mocking my friend \u2014 showing them someone else I was having fun with without them. I apologized profusely, but once again, I had abused them \u2014 betrayed them. It barely took 3 days before my friend said enough was enough. And they finally told me \u201cThis is really unfair. This is a literal repeat of my ex. You are the one who shoved me away and didn\u2019t invite me to your new group. You were flirting with others and hid it from me. So just like my ex. I\u2019m done.\u201d And then, it wouldn\u2019t matter how much I said or begged for forgiveness, I already hurt them so much.\n\n\n__________________________\nFluff over.\n\nIt took this much to finally realize, none of their subtle reminders helped. I am not the good person I believe myself to be. I abused them without even noticing. So, I guess my question is: what can I do to become more aware of when I\u2019m being abusive. Who can I talk to for treatment, and how can I be forgiven for my sins and return to being the kind person I\u2019ve always dreamed of being?\n\nThank you so much, I hope you have a wonderful day.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I see some posts from mid 2000\u2019s when I was the happiest and luckiest wife and mother on the planet and had no clue this curse of hell existed. I imagine myself not knowing what was about to come. I met my NEx in 1998 and we\u2019ve been together ever since, he is 4 years you\u2019re but I look very young. We got married in 2005 and have three kids (5,9,11). He lied about money or other things sometimes but he was deeply devoted to me and the kids. He worshipped me and I him. People would comment what a perfect couple we were. I\u2019m a Martha Stewart type of housewife but I also love politics, speaks 5 languages, and people say I\u2019m a knockout. We had sex probably 4, 5 times a week. Great sex, loving and erotic sex. He worked a lot, got promoted each time faster than the other up until being President of the Company. So, 3ish years ago the trips got more and more and more and I started saying that he needed to slow down. The more I asked, the more he traveled. Long story short, in a matter of 4 months I was devalued and discarded (of course he made it look like I told him to get out but I\u2019m smarter than that.... he had a scape plan). I did not see it coming and I did not see what was about to come. The guy that worshipped me had disgust for me, the guy that would stop talking to his friend because he left his wife, would leave his wife and be horrible to her. He canceled his credit cards that had our bills on direct deposit and slowly my cable was cut, then Water, phone, electricity just to terrorize me. I went to see his family to beg for help and they kicked me out of their house like I was nothing and never spoke to me again. It\u2019s been years of hell and torture and he keeps on sabotaging our divorce so he won\u2019t lose control over me. He is mean and cruel and cold and ignores me. Gaslighting is his weapon of choice. So is the silent treatment.The worst part? I would give everything to have my family back and I fantasize about him getting treatment, but I know I\u2019m delusional. Forgive me, it was 20 years of bliss.

Hard-working and got good grades at school. Blossomed with their career in insurance. Bought a new car, went to a lot of concerts, and traveled for a lot of weddings. Constantly there for their friends and has 2 amazing dogs.\n\n\n2. Finished their graduate degree. Fun and bubbly, and considered the life of the party. Told they are fit and pretty.

Outgoing and has lots of friends.\n\nHow many have you have been humiliated in front of police officers and Neighbors after a domestic violence dispute, where you are still shaking in the mess, and your partner is acting like nothing happened? \n\nHow many of you went to court and watched your abuser lie on the stand?\n\nHow many of you reached your breaking point and posted on social media, only to be told that you were looking for attention?\n\nHow many of you fell for the promises that the abuse would stop happening?\n\nHow many of you we're not able to report actual incidents of assault, because you knew it would be more work, or another he said she said situation?\n\nHow many of you have been hit in the face with a paperweight, and now have breathing problems?\n\nHow many of you can relate that if you continue to progress, and try to do good for yourself, Society does not see you as a victim. Society does not protect you. People think you can take on more, because they don't see you as broken if you don't manifest you're abuse the way society says you should. \n\nHow many of you understand it's not easy to talk about?

I'm on the Autistic Spectrum (tone, body language and social cues are all things I just cannot read or understand) and I was badly bullied until I was 13, so when I finally made a decent number of friends, I was so proud of myself. My group consisted of 2 kind of sections that later became rivals, here on out called the Dads (don't ask) and the Questionable. \n\nOh and uh, minor tw for reference to suicide and self harm (everyone is fine now, it just...comes up.)\n\nThe Dads were the ones I'd been friends with the longest. We were the longest standing members of our little group and the symbol of this was the Main Group Chat. That chat saw 3 incarnations and we were part of all 3. The Questionable were mainly people we adopted from other groups. They had their main friends and then they had us. They were in the 3rd interaction of the Main Chat (we don't talk about what happened to versions 1 and 2, but in two words: meme spam.) When we were 16, most of the Dads left to go to different colleges and sixth forms while most of the Questionable, as well as myself and a few other Dad friends, stayed at my school's sixth form.\n\nThings were a little tense in the first year, but nothing really beyond the Questionable calling the Dads that left \"traitors\" in a way even I could tell was a joke. The summer before the final year of sixth form however, the group exploded. Two of the Dads \"purged\" one of the mini group chats that was specifically for coffee afternoons of everyone who hadn't shown up to one in the last 4 months (this was mostly the Questionable and few Dads who were just too busy.) Sides had to be drawn and that is when things got bad.\n\nI wanted to stay friends with everyone. So when the jokes about the Dads outside of school got a little more mean, I initially went along with it. I wouldn't join in, but I would listen and fake laugh at some of them. Then the \"jokes\" started to sound more like character assassination and talking behind backs. When I would get upset, they would laugh and say I needed to lighten up \"it's just a joke.\" The Questionables would talk about reality TV and all the drinking parties they wanted to go to, but when I brought up my Special Interests (hyper fixations that some people on the ASD Spectrum can develop) I would be ignored or they would make fun of the interest, no matter how upset I got. They would ask me awkward questions about my sexuality (bi) and then make comments about it. They'd make me talk about sex too, which is topic that makes me horribly uncomfortable because I get really weird about ANY physical human contact, but they would get so graphic and then call me a prude and make me question if I was actually asexual because \"normal people don't shut down when people talk about sex Ravenclaw.\"\n\nWhen I would hang out with the Dads after the Fallout, God help me if I posted anything on Snapchat. \"Why weren't we invited? After everything we do for you, you can't invite us to one thing?\" (We used to all have games nights, but they eventually turned into drinking nights, which made a lot of us peace out on that way before the Fallout.) It was guilt trip after guilt trip after petty revenge (not inviting me to parties in response, which frankly I was fine with because I hate drunk people and loud noises.)\n\nTwo of the boys in the Questionables would make fun of one of the Dads who was at my school every single day for MONTHS, no matter how annoyed or angry my friend got. When he reported them for bullying, they blew it up like he was just trying to get them in trouble. I tried to get them to stop but they pulled the joke thing and, again, because I know I can't read tone I would drive myself to the point of hysterics trying to figure out what a \"joke\" sounded like to them. The girls were no better. They laughed at all the \"jokes\" and would say horrible things about my friends in front of me until I snapped. They even planned to break up two members of the Dad group at a party for no other reason than \"to stir sh*t\" but couldn't because the girl cancelled coming at the last minute. The group made fun of the Dad they \"joked\" about constantly when they found out he'd attempted suicide (and failed thankfully) only they wouldn't make jokes to him. They'd make them to ME and drive me insane trying to make them stop. I was nearly driven to suicide by all this crap (granted they didn't know that part, but they knew I had a history of self harm, which I ended up relapsing into.)\n\nThe thing is, even though it's over now and I hopefully never have to see them again...it stuck. I'm paranoid every time I try to interact with people because I can't tell what \"jokes\" sound like anymore. I get scared when I post anything on social media in case they think I'm trying to start something. I'm so paranoid all the time and it kind of feels like it's my fault. I had that gut feeling the whole time that all of it was wrong, but I had the mindset of \"I worked so hard to get friends, I can't lose any of them now.\" I always thought \"abuse\" was only from family or a partner. Can friends emotionally abusive too? And if so, does all of this count as it, or was I just bullied?

I've had instances where they've yelled at me and thrown around/broken my things, even in front of other people, and they turn around and call me the unreasonable one and I'm getting so sick of it that living here feels so insufferable.\n\nPlease don't suggest that I just save up and move out. It's not that simple. My mother has actively harassed me for having a job and implied over and over that I was incapable, that I shouldn't keep it when other people could apply for it until I ended up quitting, and then berated me for quitting. I'm not allowed to travel anywhere too far without telling them where I'm going and they usually pressure me into letting them supervise me. Neither of them want me to move out, and have made jokes about me never ever leaving that border on them being completely serious. I'm financially and otherwise dependent on them and it's of their design. (NTM I am autistic and my mother has tried to take advantage of that and register herself as a carer and put me on disability benefits, and screamed at me for being rejected from them because she wanted to take the money and told me I'd messed up really badly and had ruined it by answering the questions wrong.)\n\nI have no privacy, not even in my own bedroom.

I had no real support system, and she used to just use me as a sob story to come out looking like a good parent.\n\nMy mother will constantly comment on my appearance, compare herself to me and brag about how she weighs less than me or looks thinner than me and that her clothes wouldn't fit me and is? proud of that ig? And always comments on how bad my skin/acne is, and used to hold me down so she could pick at my skin because it looked wrong. \n\nBoth of my parents have horrific anger issues and sometimes I'll talk to them and not have even done anything wrong and I'll be snapped at.

Recently a couple that are both in the cult were awaiting their 7th child (Birth control is not allowed within the group) only to mysteriously have a miscarriage after the husband was confronted by his wife about an affair he was having with her brothers girlfriend.

With that said, I am going to a private university that I received *almost* enough scholarship money to go (this will come into play later on).\n\nSo, this all began a very long time ago with my mom constantly accusing my dad of stealing her phone, car keys, cigarettes, medication (she is prescribed oxycodone), the list goes on. For a long time I didn't know who to believe because I was so young, I didn't know if my mom was making it up, actually believed it or if my dad really DID do it (which I don't think he ever actually did now). Due to this and other related issues, my mom and dad were always on-and-off and never lived together for more than a week or two at a time. My dad was an alcoholic, which may have been partially caused by my mother, and eventually led to Cirrhosis of the liver; death. This, for my mom, seemed like a breaking point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFollowing my dads death, my mom got much, much worse. I don't want to name any specific names but for the past 4 years she has blamed EVERY SINGLE inconvenience in her life on a former police commissioner where I live. Here are some of the claims she has made against him and a few other local 'officials' in my area:\n\n\\- Breaking into and \"sabotaging\" her car  \n\\- Breaking into and \"crawling\" in our house  \n\\- Listening to her phone calls  \n\\- Watching her through her TV (which I explained to her countless times does NOT have a webcam)  \n\\- Stealing her keys, phone, pills, the usual  \n\\- Having cars wait for her to leave her house to follow her  \n\\- Cars purposely driving slow to stall her from getting home (so they can crawl in the house obviously)\n\nOn top of this, she got into a very bad car accident a year and a half ago, which she claims was *them* trying to kill her.\n\nThere really is no limit to the things she will accuse this man of, she must think he has every connection and an endless supply of cash lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a while I didn't confront her about it because I just didn't want to hear her bitch even more than she does about useless, imaginary things. But once my dad passed, she had no one to abuse. Now that there was no one else to accuse for the things SHE DOES, she started accusing me and my sister. Ironically, it started with taking her keys, and her phone. Then it evolved into her pills and reading her text messages. Now, I'm not going to act like this doesn't get me pissed and I certainly do scream at her when she has pushed me enough. Nothing I say or do (or anyone for that matter) can get through to her. She is extremely bipolar to the point where she could call me her favorite child one minute and then threaten my life in the next. Probably the most heinous thing she has said to me was \"If I go to Albany and find out *all of this* was **you**, I will put a bullet between your eyes.\" Which I quickly laughed in her face and called her out on her insanity. I have tried to talk to her rationally about the situation but shes the most stubborn person I have ever met. I have less than a week to apply for my college loan and I need her (a parent) to cosign with me. Obviously my dad isn't an option and she refuses to cosign for me because of \"all the terrible things I've done to her\". Mind you, I have NEVER, not even once, taken her keys or cell phone or anything of that nature. If I'm being completely honest I couldn't care less about her as a human being, I just need her for this loan. I plan to cut all contact with her after college.

Most of the time it\u2019s just a low-level uneasiness-- I talk myself off the ledge and go on with my day. But a few times a year or so, I have full-on anxiety attacks that will last for about 24 hours or so. Usually they\u2019re triggered by an impending people-y event, but not always. They\u2019ll gradually ramp up over the course of the day, until I\u2019m virtually paralyzed in bed, heart racing, crying until I can\u2019t breathe. And then they just sort of abruptly pass.\n\nSince I've been with my narc, I\u2019ve had exactly two of these anxiety attacks. When the second one happened, it was the night before we were supposed to spend the weekend at the house of our mutual friends. I remember laying there in his arms crying, and he seemed so sympathetic. Stayed up with me until I fell asleep, asking if I wanted to talk about it. The next morning, I was having a rough time getting out of bed, so I slept in while he went to his softball practice. He got home at around 10 and made breakfast for us. When I came out to eat, he was still playing the supportive boyfriend role. Told me he\u2019d been worried about me the night before, and asked how I was feeling and if I still felt up to our weekend plans. By that point, the anxiety attack had passed, so I told him let\u2019s do it.\n\nWe went on to have a great weekend. He kept telling me over and over how much fun he was having, how proud he was of me, and how glad he was that I had decided to come. That Sunday night, we were pulling into his apartment complex. I was smiling from ear-to-ear, on a bit of a high, when he turned to me and said, \u201cI really resent the fact that I had to practically beg you to come out this weekend. I don\u2019t want to have to pull teeth every time we have social plans.\u201d My jaw dropped to the floor, and I just sat there dumbfounded. He continued, \u201cAnd I was really disappointed when I came home at 12 in the afternoon \\[it was NOT noon, it was 10 am\\], and you were still in bed. I was excited to get our day started, and all you wanted to do was sleep. I don\u2019t know if I can be with someone who wants to sleep the weekend away all the time.\u201d \n\nWhat. WHAT. I couldn\u2019t believe my ears. He\u2019d done a complete 180, acting so concerned all weekend, only to turn around and use my disorder against me. Shame me for it, even. Impress upon me how inconvenienced he was by the whole affair. Not only that, but he made it like I was some lazy, anti-social sloth. Like this was a regular occurrence, when, in reality, I could count on one hand how many times I\u2019d slept past 10 or said no to plans. In fact, sleeping late was something I\u2019d made it a point never to do with him, because I knew he was a morning person and would probably judge me if I did. And as difficult as social situations are for me to navigate, I\u2019d also made it a point to smile, smile, smile and go with the flow so he wouldn\u2019t feel like I was a Debbie Downer. Basically, I\u2019d tried so hard to sweep my anxiety under the rug and put on a brave face for his sake, and he took my one major moment of weakness and let it define me. Used it as ammo against me.\n\nSince then, the anxiety disorder thing has come up on occasion. Usually it\u2019ll be out of the blue, in the middle of some deep relationship talk about something else, and he\u2019ll say something along the lines of, \u201cYou have really bad anxiety, and that\u2019s something I worry about in this relationship.\u201d Note, he\u2019s not worried about me, he\u2019s worried about how it\u2019ll affect us (a.k.a. him). Not only that, but I\u2019m not sure what the point of bringing it up at all is. We\u2019ve established that I\u2019m an anxious person. I know it. He knows it. Nothing constructive can be accomplished by reminding me about it. Nothing constructive for me, at least\u2026He probably gets a kick out of poking at my weak spot and making sure I don\u2019t get too comfortable with the insane notion that he could ever just, I don\u2019t know, accept me for it. God forbid.\n\nAnyway, I think about that night a lot. It\u2019s had the effect of making me anxious about my anxiety. \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t you dare get anxious around him. FUCK, NOW I\u2019M ANXIOUS.\u201d I\u2019m just wondering if anyone has a similar experience to share.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Even though we got back together I started avoiding him like the plague because I honestly couldn't stand being around him. I think it's for this reason that I never even got close to the discard phase; he was using all of his narc manipulation to try to reel me back in. That's something I take a little pride in; he underestimated me when he pegged me for his victim. \n\nMeanwhile behind the scenes he was scamming and playing weird head games with his/our friends and all the worst junkies in town as he used his heroin hookup (\"the best deals!\") and \"poor me\" complex to get his supply of attention, since he lacked any charisma. Of course when I found out about this other life and broke up with him for real, he started erratically alternating between lovebombing/victimhood, blaming me for the state of his life, and trying to make me feel crazy.\n\nThere's so much more to the story, of course, but I only just discovered the narcissist criteria (surprise, he meets every single one) and this subreddit and a lot of things have clicked into place for me. I'm struggling tremendously with the fear of being taken advantage of, of not really being loved, of being lied to. I apologize constantly to my now-boyfriend for everything, despite his best efforts to build me up and tell me that I shouldn't be apologizing for anything to anybody.\n\nI think I'll stay in this sub for a while, I have a lot to read and think through while I rediscover myself again.

We went to therapy for a while over a year ago but he felt that the therapist didn't take his side so he stopped going. When I brought up going to a new therapist yesterday, he said he likes who he is and doesn't think he needs therapy. \n\nHis main issue with our marriage is that I don't 'want him like I used to' and he doesn't feel loved because the only way he feels love is through sexual contact. Sex once or twice a week, with occasional two week gaps is just not meeting his 'requirement' and when I'm not the one initiating it, he has no interest because it should be my idea, because I should 'not be able to keep my hands off him'. \n\nHe's pressured me into things I didn't like before, even went so far as convincing me that him having a girlfriend on the side was healthy because his appetite is just too much for one woman, but then he still cheated behind my back. Months later when he finally told me he cheated on me - he did so during sex. \n\nWe separated for a while, I dated someone else younger and more attractive (who had his own serious issues, so that ended), then I got back together with my husband after some serious hoovering on his part, he even went to a psychiatrist and was diagnosed bipolar and given mood stabilizers. He doesn't believe he's bipolar though, and talks about quitting his meds all the time. \n\nI feel like he may be starting the discard phase. He doesn't talk to me very much anymore, spends a lot of time on his phone. Started going to the gym again. When I left him the last time, he went on a smear campaign at our workplace. He drove by houses he thought I might be at, cornered my friends into conversations for hours. I think it would be easier if he were the one to leave this time. \n\nIs he a narc? Am I just overanalyzing like I usually do? Is it just a libido mismatch? I have a hard time believing those are valid options after the emotional, verbal, and physical abuse in the past. He blames all of that behavior on the antidepressants he was on at the time, though. He 'wasn't himself'.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I am still afraid that someone will find me. I just joined Reddit recently and found this subreddit, so here goes.\n\nI bought a plane ticket to the farthest place possible without leaving the country so that I (hopefully) will never have to see my family again. It's been over five years since then. My mother, brother, and sister were all abusive. My mother was a borderline personality who was the classic narcissistic parent. She highly favored my siblings and pushed me into the role of scapegoat. I have stab wounds and a flat spot on my head from where my brother slammed a bat into it. I have not slept a full night since I was a child because of nightmares, flashbacks, and I still wake up the instant my significant other goes to the bathroom at night because of fear. I was told that I was worthless, ugly, stupid, etc. every single day. My mother hated looking at me and would lash out if I accidentally caught her in a bad moment.  My sister was more of a victim, but chose to abuse me to keep from being abused. I understand her reasoning and don't fault her for it.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was about eleven and he continued to emotionally blackmail me until he disappeared when I was about sixteen. Basically, because I was the eldest, it was my full responsibility to raise and care for my siblings until we were all out of the house. He knew what my brother was like (no empathy, angry, enjoyed hurting others). He didn't want either of my siblings in foster care or jail and I understand his stance as well. Nonetheless, he made me feel more helpless, useless, and guilty than all of my other family combined. He manipulated me into a situation in which there was no escape for me. I took everything without a single protest or fight. Nobody loves a scapegoat and so my siblings didn't even like me, much less respect me. My father also made it impossible to seek medical treatment as it would have exposed my brother and mother's abuse. He wanted it all kept a secret and I did.\n\nMy mother was neglectful as well as abusive and so I worked at least two jobs since I was eleven in order to buy food for my siblings. I lied about my age to get work, tried to keep my siblings fed and clothed, and was beaten almost on a daily basis. It was hell. I never told anyone. I had five people in my family who physically abused me and three who sexually abused me. It was all a blur. I still don't understand exactly how everything escalated until it was just... normal. I have left out all but the mildest of details to try and demonstrate just how horrific a childhood can become.\n\nMy grandparents; however, were lovely, kind people. I did have aunts and uncles who cared about me. There was an aunt who once came into my room when I was doing homework and just stared at me for a while. She said \"poor darling, your own mother doesn't want you.\" It was in a different language and the connotation was much kinder than it seems. She tucked a hundred dollars in my hand and left me alone because we both knew she would do nothing for me. There was a mutual understanding in the family that my mother was the black sheep and her kids were her own problem. I knew that they knew something was wrong. Whenever my brother or mother found the money I squirreled away, they took it and it was never mentioned. I still managed to save over five thousand dollars so that one day, I could run away.\n\nThe day after my high school graduation, I left. I didn't think to change my phone number because I was young and stupid, but my aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents called and texted. I deleted most of the texts without reading them and finally took a call from an aunt who had tried to reach out to me the most. She begged me to come back and told me that I never had to see my mother or anyone else if I just came back. They would help they said. They would support me and I didn't have to be hurt or alone. I didn't go back and I never spoke to anyone else. She meant every word she said. My aunt and other family probably would have helped, probably would have kept those promises... but I just couldn't stand any of them. I couldn't look at any of them anymore. They hadn't done anything to me and had even helped me in the past, but I was so sick of family, I didn't hate them, but I hated the very idea of family. My grandmother had a weak heart and it is possible that my leaving did irreparable damage to her health. I left her too.\n\nSo here I am. Some of you may think I wrote this for validation of my choices. I can completely understand that. But this decision to cut them all off has stung like a dull paper cut ever since. I will not ever contact them. I hope that they will never look for me. I just want a third party to come in and truthfully tell me if I was the asshole for not giving the rest of my family a chance. For not, at the very least, keeping in contact with people who truly cared for my well-being and future. When I say my mother was the black sheep, I meant it. The rest of my family was fairly wealthy, decent, and could have done something for me. They loved me and I broke my grandparent's hearts (in their eyes, most likely) for acting exactly the way my mother did when she was my age. I also wanted to get this out of my head. Many people have dismissed my guilt, saying that I have nothing to feel guilty about, but sometimes it doesn't help to hear that as they never really take into account that I did purposefully decide to leave behind people who did love me.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

This doesn\u2019t happen often, but it does tend to happen a few times a month like clockwork. The most recent blow-up is as followed: His mother wanted us to come visit her on her shift, and bring her coffee and a sandwich. He agreed early in the day and sounded excited, and said we could bring his little sister and her friend. The day goes on and he needs to pick up her medication so I offered him a ride since I was going to the pharmacy anyway. He said no, and said he \u201chad a lot of stuff to do\u201d (smoke with his brother\u2019s girlfriend. I said okay, went to the store, and as I was driving back he called me sounding very angry. He said things like \u201che might as well just go by himself to get the coffee, he has all this shit he has to do, I should live in his shoes for a day,\u201d things like that. I say \u201cit\u2019s okay, I can go run those errands for you.\u201d He says \u201ccome get the Starbucks gift card and leave,\u201d then hung the phone up. \n\nI get the card, start heading to the store and he shoots me a text that just says \u201cyou\u2019re a straight ass.\u201d I reply with \u201cwhat is your problem?\u201d He then calls me then goes off about how he is sick of me, how I don\u2019t see all the shit he deals with, how he wishes I could spend a day in his shoes. He tends to resort to that philosophy in our arguments, live a day in his shoes, when I see his life and what goes on on a daily basis. \n\nA little backstory on him, when he was younger he was admitted in the mental hospital for BPD, anxiety and depression. I believe he still has these illnesses (can\u2019t be sure, he won\u2019t go to a psychiatrist) and self medicates with marijuana. The weed usually soothes him and makes him a fun, sweet, enjoyable person to be around. We took our first vacation together not long ago and it went perfectly, besides one little quell as we were driving home. It\u2019s hard to tell what will set him off. \n\nWe work at the same place, and tonight is a mandatory monthly meeting where all employees gather. He called me again when I was driving and told me to not go to the meeting. \n\nI am having a very stressful time right now, I\u2019m taking care of my house alone while my dad is disabled after a DWI car wreck and is living at my grandparents and very worried about my sick dog, all I ask of him is to spend the night at my house so I\u2019m not alone. This is also a stressful point for him. \n\nMore, unrelated things he does for reference is continuously canceling plans on me, saying he will do one thing but end up not doing it (ex: I will come over tonight, doesn\u2019t come over, says he\u2019ll come over in the morning, then makes me come pick him up instead.)\n\nHe recently got promoted at his job and has to quit smoking for the drug test. He said he would, didn\u2019t smoke for a day, then the night he said he was coming to spend the night he went and smoked instead. \n\nAnother argument that happened recently ended in him throwing his iPhone 7+ so hard that the front and back of it shattered, saying that I should\u2019ve stopped arguing. Honestly, at this point, I block out all of our arguments and forget what happens. I will usually just cry or have a panic attack and sit in his bathroom til I can calm down enough to drive home. \n\nOne time I went on a day trip to the mountains with my grandma, aunt and little cousin who I rarely get to see. He got so angry to the point where he said he was just going to drive his car into the woods and kill himself because I canceled our plans to chill at his house so I could visit my grandma. \n\nI love him. I love his family especially. They have taken me in, offered me a stable home to live in with two happily married parents, younger sister, and three dogs. I never had that when I was growing up, my father is a drug addict, rapist, and abuser so that was all I knew when I was little. I love the normalcy here but just don\u2019t know what to do about the outbreaks of anger from my boyfriend. It hasn't been all bad, he has helped me financially, buying ashes for my dog who was struck by a car unexpectedly, buying me a new phone when mine broke and just making me laugh. What should I do about this situation? I feel so stuck. I am happy 95% of the time with him, and my happiness would baiscally be nonexistent at my house alone besides my two dogs who bring me joy.\n\nTL;DR boyfriend tends to blow up with anger a few times a month. He takes his anger out on me and I am very lost as to what to do in the situation.\n\nEDIT: added spaces between paragraphs for an easier read", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I need to vent/hope someone can reassure me, or ...something. I'll try to make it short....\n\nSo I started talking to this guy in October 2018. We had a lot of common interests. I started liking him, but he had a lot of red flags and narc traits I ignored until the blow up at the end (we'll get there). He always kept saying let's be friends, he's not ready/work is too much right now, etc. The excuses. Fast forward, he finally said he loved me and I said back it to him. But it felt wrong. I had been feeling like something was wrong for at least a month up to that point. Well, I find out that the girl I asked him about (and got a lot of gaslighting and run-around about when I asked), turned out to have been with him since JANUARY. I had no idea!!! This hurt so badly because he and I were getting along great... I found this out in May.\n\nBeing the person I am, I didn't want to be a homewrecker. So I reached out to her. She quickly cut him off but she didn't block his number. That stood out to me as odd. Well, he came running back to me because she dropped him, and he love-bombed me in a way he never did before, saying he would treat me the way he wasn't able to before. In a way, he looked very insecure. We went on one date. I stupidly paid. Again. Just like I had brought him food and things to make him smile throughout this whole thing...but never got that back. Anyway..\n\nI don't remember how or what made this happen at the moment but he was able to go to her place and talk to her in person and begged her to take him back. He had apologized to me and did the same thing before that date, just not on the same level. She told him she didn't want him and that was that. She blocked him on social media, but not this number. He then told me he wanted nothing to do with either of us and he then discarded me. He had a book of mine so he dropped that off a week or so later, and he had this immense amount of hatred in his eyes and said \"he has to go\" and was being very impatient with his mannerisms. I felt a surge of anger run through me because he had said before the meeting that maybe we can talk - because I felt I needed some closure. I then said no, never mind, it's not worth it. And slammed the door in his face. (that felt great. after he used me all that time)\n\nWell the hoovering on me began. He'd sometimes \"like\" a pic of mine, but we never talked. I finally caved one day and made a joke on a post how \"this could have been us...\" He then said something like maybe someday.  I told him something like \"well for something to happen ,one has to try.\" (now I feel this was thrown in my face... you'll see) and said a few more things and basically said goodbye to him and blocked all of his stuff. This was on a Thursday.\n\nMonday comes around and I see she unblocked him. And now they're following each other again. And there's a pic of her looking all happy and dumb and I could tell that he had captured her again and taken her on a date, (I'm not dumb. I did the detective work the first time, I'll do it again) so I sent her a long slew of messages (when we had talked before, she was very cordial and I felt we could be friends, back when I first told her about it.) The messages I sent this time basically said that he had taken me out on a date just like he did to you, all because you dropped him; I showed her our texts and said he's doing the same thing to you, etc etc. I was livid. I told her this is the dumbest ish I've ever gotten into, you deserve each other. (I was shaking with anger) So I blocked her b/c instead of responding to me, she went to him.\n\nHe then called me a b\\*tch, told me to stop bringing my bullsh\\*t (excuse me sir, you used me for like 8 months and cheated on her then cried to us both and you want to tell me that IIIIIIIIIII am full of bullsh\\*t???) to him and \"his women\" (LOL freudian slip on the plural there.)\n\nI had a complete melt down. I then prayed and prayed, but I cried every single night after this because I thought of the good times with him, then of the times he just downright used me.\n\nFast forward to now, a month after all of this. I had been doing great, moving on, not thinking about him. Writing songs to get it out of my system... my poetic justice. For some reason I was feeling off today though... and though I had them both blocked, (I was trying to move on) I can see their stupid profile pictures. I saw today that hers had changed to a pic of them both, smiling, together. Funny cause he never did that before with her. I couldn't help myself and I told her again how he was only love-bombing her, only doing this because I dropped him this time, and that he and I had taken a pic exactly like that one, when he had taken me on that date. She blocked me without a response.\n\nWhen she ran back to him, it really really hurt me. It's like I wasted my time trying to tell her about it. I was really angry that she could take him back after all the we talked about. SHE was telling ME how bad he was. I think she did it only to make me back off. Either way, there were things she didn't like about him.\n\nThis time, I don't know what to think. I think I made myself look stupid and bothered by seeing that pic. Which I am, but she blocked me. She's so deep in denial, and for some reason THAT hurts me more. I feel foolish as if I took the bait, as if she wanted me to see that and me be hurt by it, but I think I'm just paranoid. I think what's really happening, as I tried to tell her, is that he's love-bombing her, and just like he did me and her, the \"jabs\" will start later, the put-downs, the controlling behavior he had (he told me not to sleep with anyone but oh look, he was cheating), the manipulating and gaslighting... it will all start again. But she can't see that and refuses to see the truth. This kills me. But I know it's not my burden to bear, I guess I just never got any closure.\n\nYes, the things he did/said to me hurt, (lots of common narc things) but I've moved on from that. But trying to lead the blind and deaf (her) is so hurtful when your intentions were never wrong. And then they refuse to see it and block you. One of my biggest fears when I get around bad people, narcs, like him, is that they'll go and do this to someone else. Well now I've witnessed it firsthand and was in the middle of it.\n\nSo now I'm having really terrible thoughts of how I want revenge on them both. I don't know why. Again, I think it's that I never got closure. And I want him to hurt but now he has her back. I just want to yell and scream like an idiot at them both. He's supposed to be suffering for cheating on her. And for using me and discarding me and telling me that I was only \"flesh\" to him. When I surely wasn't. This ISN'T FAIR. HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HAPPY. I'm not the one who is supposed to be suffering! I did nothing wrong!! I tried to warn her! I just loved him unconditionally? WHY ME????\n\nI just keep having pretty violent thoughts in my head toward them both and don't know how to control it. I'm also just thinking something is wrong with me for me to have repelled two people, the man being someone I truly cared about and loved unconditionally, and the woman, being someone I tried to help see through this and move on only to basically be spat on for trying to help her get away from his narc \\*ss.\n\nI'm broken and not sure how to fix myself at this point. It's very painful. Ok this was long. Oops", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I want to understand what had happened better. Equating this to abuse has always felt strange to me, but everyone who knew us or who I talk to about this has always told me that she was emotionally abusive/extremely manipulative. While I had only been hit by her out of anger a very few number of times, I do not want anyone to think that I\u2019m equating what had happened to serious physical abuse that I\u2019m sure some of you have experienced. I just need to start taking the steps of processing all of this. I\u2019ll be occasionally referring to her as M.\n\nI met M at a very weak and lonely time in my life. She showed me adoration and love and was deeply damaged from a broken home life fueled by alcoholism and abuse. Naturally, I wanted to do everything I could to help her and save her. I inadvertently pledged myself to her in a way. I did everything I could to keep her from harms way, trying to shield and comfort her from all distress and pain. \n\nThis was fine until she began using this to her advantage.  She\u2019d frequently tell me she wanted me all to herself, she didn\u2019t want anyone coming in the way between us... this led to her ultimately keeping me from all of my friends and family. If I wasn\u2019t giving her the time or attention she wanted every day, she\u2019d throw a fit- and I\u2019d always chase after her. In the middle of dinner with my family and she wanted to see me? She\u2019d park in front of my house and relentlessly text me, refusing to leave until I would see her. When my family would have her over for dinner, she would sit in silence, refusing to engage with my family, sometimes whispering things to me. God forbid I ever went out with the few  friends I was able to give any time or energy to... each and every time there\u2019d be a problem. She\u2019d call me leaving voicemails crying or yelling or sending me texts to make me feel guilty for being out. I always gave in, and it was never enough.\n\nI always tried to support her in whatever endeavor she took on. I genuinely tried to do everything I could to make her happy and not only was it not enough, but that support was never returned to me. As I said before, if I wanted to spend time with friends, go on a trip with the family, go to a party or when I thought about going to college, it was always met with intense emotional breakdowns, bombarding me with guilt and negativity around things that were supposed to be happy. \n\n\n*slightly nsfw warning*\nBeing raised Catholic there was always a very weird guilt associated with sex. It was something I\u2019ve always feared and had anxiety around in a way. As sexually maturing teenagers who had been dating for a while, we both had urges. She, being the first person I\u2019d had ever had sexual contact with, however taught me what she liked. She trained me to do what she wanted when she wanted and once she was satisfied, she wouldn\u2019t even touch me. She\u2019d often leave the room and continue doing something else like watch TV, if I ever asked for a gesture to be returned or the few times I ever brought up the possibility of sex it would be firmly dismissed. I bring this aspect up because it\u2019s something I still don\u2019t understand. It deeply affected me and I internalized these denials for years. Now that I am in a healthy relationship I find myself having an extremely difficult time initiating with my partner now, if she comes on to me it often sends me in a tizzy of anxiety which over time has been strenuous on our sex life. I don\u2019t know how to even come close to addressing this problem.\n\n\nWhen I finally did go to college M was a senior in HS. The following fall term she applied to the out of state school I was at and made a huge effort to make sure that her dorm room was the one connected next to mine. Her reason was that she wanted to know what I was doing all the time. If I was home, if I was leaving, if I had people there. Once this happened I had already had a term away from her and was making friends and growing into my own. One friend I made, I immediately fell in love with. We clicked like I\u2019ve never clicked with another person, so I avoided her like the plague. But once M had followed me to school and continued to try to control me, I began to truly resent her for once. This led to me, for once, breaking the rules and going to a party with some friends rather than staying in my room or her room. There, I got drunk and the friend I loved tried to seduce me. We made out but stopped before anything else had happened. I ran back to the dorm and the following months spiraled. I wanted to drop out of school and move back home so I did, of course M followed me back. I was in a guilt fueled depression like I had never experienced before and felt truly trapped. Much to my disgust in myself, I still never told M about what happened... I\u2019m still eaten alive with guilt and disappointment in myself.\n\n\nTowards, around the 3 year 8 month mark, I tried to break up with her twice. By this I mean I would firmly tell her that it\u2019s over- which of course was met with hysterical begging and hours of guilt trips for failing her/leaving. The next day she\u2019d show up at my house like nothing had happened- not talking about what happened at all. \n\n\nI know this all doesn\u2019t sound like much, but after nearly 4 years of non stop scenarios like these, there was a serious strain on my wellbeing. There are too many stories I could tell and examples I could give but this sums up the gist of it.\n\nMy friends, my family, my teachers in high school, multiple therapists all constantly warned me that this relationship was not only unhealthy, but manipulative and scary. I saw what they were talking about in a way, I\u2019d see that her behavior wasn\u2019t normal, but I felt in too deep. Regardless of it all I still cared about her undyingly. I had pledged myself to her, though I wasn\u2019t in love with her. This is where I run into trouble with the whole situation. I stayed with her. I chose to let these things happen, I never confronted her and very rarely told her how I felt or called out her behavior. I still had to protect her through all of it, which just further enabled her to continue. I can\u2019t be mad at her, even though I\u2019ve felt hatred towards her it doesn\u2019t feel right. \n\nI ended up breaking up with her. It was out of the blue just before our 4 year anniversary. I refused to give in and have hardly talked to her since. I feel an overwhelming amount of guilt, as in the times I\u2019ve talked to her she still doesn\u2019t understand what has happened. She reached out to me a few months ago and we agreed to be friends again, but after a few days of talking to her I just... felt too much and was too confused so I stopped talking to her and haven\u2019t talked to her since. \n\nAm I making something out of nothing? Am I just in still feeling kinda traumatized and hurt? I never really gave her closure and I feel a lot of guilt over that... I know I can\u2019t ask you all to tel me what to do but I still don\u2019t know what the right thing to do is. \n\nIf you\u2019ve read this far thank you for taking the time, I apologize for how scrambled this is...", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Every Christmas his family does this tradition that takes up most of the morning. Even though my ex is a *proud* atheist, he still participates, because it\u2019s family. The whole deal includes his family (MIL, FIL, SIL, and SIL\u2019s husband and kids) lining up in order of age and singing Silent Night in German, followed by a reading of the Bible and a very slow, tedious opening of the presents, also in age order, one present at a time, and the present was always passed around to each person before another could be opened. It\u2019s grueling, especially with younger children, who have zero patience when it comes to waiting for their gifts. \n\nThe first Christmas, we arrived, set our gifts down, and within minutes my Nex was like, \u201cSo, I guess you\u2019ll want to wait outside since you still don\u2019t want to be a part of it.\u201d And looking back I can see how wording it that way gave me only two choices: stay warm and participate, or, OP does not want to be a part of the family and would sooner wait in the cold. Maintaining boundaries always made me the asshole in that family. I made an excuse that I was expecting my parents to call me anyway, and went outside to call them.\n\n\nSo my \u201ctradition\u201d became waiting outside in the snow for an hour or two while they completed the ceremony. I would call my dad and stepmom, who live across the country from me, and sit in the cold and talk to them. My dad and I haven\u2019t always had the best relationship, but it\u2019s amazing now, so I would focus on the miracle of having such wonderful parents in my adult life (even though I was literally parentless for most of my childhood). I\u2019d think of positive and beautiful things about the moment, like the way the snow flurries came down so gently, or the smell of fireplaces burning in the neighborhood. I\u2019d try and appreciate just being alive and healthy.\n\nI\u2019d ask my dad to text me photos of their tree while we chatted, so I could be \u201cnext to one.\u201d I was not allowed to have a Christmas tree, because that would mean moving the living room around, and Nex liked to keep his vintage furniture in a very specific way. (In fact, when I moved into his house- he already owned it- *none* of my furniture was allowed in any other parts of the house other than my bedroom. We had separate bedrooms.) I made up for this by buying fake plant vines and twisting them up with some white twinkle lights around the fireplace, and that was our \u201ctree.\u201d My \u201ctree.\u201d He decided he liked the garland and kept it year round. It stopped feeling like a Christmas tree around March. \n\nWhen my dad asked me where Nex was, or why I was outside, I made it sound like it was my choice. Like I was giving them space for family time. I never told anyone that I was asked to wait outside, because then I\u2019d have to admit that *i agreed to it.* By the time I could come back in, I would be wrecked with guilt that I had \u201cshunned their family time,\u201d or that I was being a bratty, passive-aggressive asshole for not wanting to participate in my husband\u2019s childhood tradition. I felt awkward and uncomfortable anyway. My MIL would ask me what kinds of traditions I practiced as a child. But my childhood was very isolated and full of neglect, so we didn\u2019t really have any. I\u2019d hoped that her son and I could create some of our own. But the Christmas garland on the fireplace should have been a sign that would never happen. And it didn\u2019t. \n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been over two years since he discarded me, and I\u2019m just now realizing that this was a form of gaslighting, grooming, manipulation. I was his *wife.* I didn\u2019t deserve waiting outside in the snow on Christmas morning for *any* reason, goddammit! He never accepted me as new family. I was just the side piece to the rest of his life. \n\n\nNarcissistic abuse is so fucked, guys. It\u2019s an invisible slow cooker. It leaves no marks, no bruises, and often no disparaging words or insults to vent about later. It sneaks up on you, and before you know it, you feel worthless, small, powerless, and you believe all those feelings are your own fault for being a broken person. \n\n\n(Before you ask, yes I am in therapy, and I\u2019m really thriving. I\u2019m working hard on my recovery. I\u2019ve just been deep in these kind of subreddits for a few days, and suddenly I just wanted to get this off my chest. So thanks for reading.)\n\n\nEDIT 1: I\u2019m remembering it being pronounced \u201cVine-NOSH-tuba\u201d but I could be remembering this word wrong. I don\u2019t know. I was told to wait outside. Maybe it was \u201cWeihnachtstag?\u201d And Maybe it\u2019s Austrian, not German. \n\nEDIT 2: They *are* German-Austrian. That\u2019s right. I just forget the Austrian part, because of the fluent German he spoke around me. It\u2019s kind of comforting to know I\u2019ve gained enough distance to forget details like that.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It saddens me so much to think of how I could\u2019ve loved you and gave you everything. You took everything from me. Whether it was intentional right in front of my face or in a more metaphorical sense, I have nothing anymore. I didn\u2019t know I was two months pregnant and had a miscarriage which is one of the most difficult things I have ever been through. You supported me but now all of that feels so ugly. I knew I wasn\u2019t ready and was thankful but still so devastated. Now the whole thing is very confusing. When I finally had the perfect way to get away from you (with proof you had been calling your ex) you told me you prayed you had gotten me pregnant. That is...terrifying and disgusting. Hearing these things after I finally broke away from you and the love ended on my end everything hit me like a tsunami. I was disgusted by you. My stomach turns and my whole body gets hot when I think of you or see any reminder of you. I feel like I\u2019m rebuilding after a disaster, well I am but it feels devastating. I have come to terms with the fact that you are a narcissistic sociopath and we were in an abusive relationship. I never wanted to admit these things to myself as much as I thought them. I made excuse after excuse for you. I put myself on the line in every aspect for you. When you abused me you forced me to hide it. You forced ME to feel shameful about it. That\u2019s so fucked up. I still LOVED you! I am so angry with myself because I let you into more than one of my homes, my three safe places I loved the most. But even worse I let you into me. All of me and you ruined me. I feel like I will never trust anyone ever again. I feel like I will never be enough for another person because you tore me down so low. When you THOUGHT I cheated on you instead of evaluating the situation and talking to me and letting me PROVE with videos of me ugly sleeping with time stamps (not that I should even have to go to that extent!!), you basically told me I deserved to be sexually abused by you because I messed up and had to deal with the consequences. You told me I had to act like we were still dating so no one got suspicious but that you were going to use me for sex even if I didn\u2019t want it. You wanted to keep me prisoner in my own home where I have some of my favorite childhood memories. They are ruined and overrun by horrible traumatic memories of you. I don\u2019t feel safe or comfortable in my own home with my own family now. But that was after you talked aloud to me about how I\u2019m so lucky because you really just wanna kill me now and dump my body somewhere. I have never been more scared for my life than I have in the past 6 months repeatedly. You have fucked my head up more than anything or anyone. Whether it was all cap or just to make me scared of you, there\u2019s still half of me that believes you are capable of these things and you could\u2019ve and still want to do these things. I am terrified everywhere I go. How can you do that to someone. And hardly anyone knows about this. You\u2019re still walking free and skating by and you will continue to unfortunately because you are a master manipulator. You deserve to be in prison. You should\u2019ve stayed in jail. I can\u2019t tell you how much and how long panic circulated through my body when I found out you weren\u2019t there anymore. Genuine fear I couldn\u2019t control. That\u2019s not normal. My life is forever changed by you and I fight everyday to not let you still control my life even though we have no contact whatsoever. I just want my life back.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I don't remember exactly when this happened. I think I was around 8 or 9 but I can't forget about it.\n\nWhen I was younger, my mom would constantly bring us to her friends house(Cora).  They had been friends for decades, ever since they were in 3rd grade so my mom let me spend the night a lot to play with her children.  I was used to seeing other children constantly at their house because my mother's friend was a christian mother who had many friends from church.  Their children would often play with us or spend the night with us.  One day when my mom came to pick me up, her friend invited another friend to hang out with(I'll nickname her Mila).  My mom didn't just pick me up, she stayed a few hours to have a friendly conversation with Cora and Mila.  Mila brought her two boys with her, one was 2 years older than me and the other was 2 years younger than me, so we played some games while we waited.  I feel stupid at the time because I didn't see the obvious hints of a sexual game the older boy wanted to play.  I didn't have a lot of friends, so I didn't know a lot of games that kids would normally play.  I just kind of did what he said without question thinking it was a game I didn't know about.  He kept on talking about how it was a game that he wanted to play with only me and tried to leave his brother behind in the playroom while we went to another room.  \n\nI thought it was unfair at the time, but really wanted to play this game so I agreed with him.  His brother stopped trying to play and we went to the room.  I forgot the rules of the game and how he explained it, but I know that we had to both hide under the covers for some reason. We both hid next to each other under the covers and I was excited to learn about the game when I felt his hand rubbing my leg and going up further.  He grabbed at me and I just remember the confusion and panic as I kicked him really hard and didn't stop until he fell off the bed.\n\nHe got really pissed and gave me a glare as he ran off into the kitchen.  I remember vividly feeling guilty for kicking and hurting him so I tried to apologize but he just looked at me like I was crazy and the bad guy. We both ran off to our mothers and didn't say anything about it.\n\nI saw them sometimes at parties that Cora would throw and I would avoid them and sit next to my mother the whole time.  I'm now 18 and this is constantly in the back of my mind.  I feel guilty for remembering it because it wasn't that bad and he didn't actually hurt me compared to things that my family and friends have went through.  I kind of want to tell my mom or someone, but I don't want the victim label or for the older brother to get in trouble after all these years.  I don't even know if he still remembers it since we were so young.\n\nHe recently contacted me and is trying to be friendly, but I don't know what to do or how to respond.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

(For whatever reason, she assumed she couldn't get pregnant; there's no medical reason.) I described the situation last night to an old friend who had some serious mental health issues when we were in college, and he said she was a narcissist just like his dad. I started reading and everything suddenly made sense.\n\nI'm leaving out lot of pieces, and there are so many more awful things than what I'm describing - I can't believe what I've put up with...but many other people's stories sound the same: criticism of seemingly everything I do (down to cutting fruit the wrong way and flushing the toilet too often), zero apologies or acknowledgement of responsibility, using vulnerabilities I've exposed to criticize me later, manipulative arguments that left my head spinning, being told that anything she ever did wrong is my fault (e.g. when she got a parking ticket - I wasn't even around), obstructionist behavior that prevents us from getting house projects done and of course zero empathy/me being too sensitive. I really took it all in - worked harder to not get criticized, tried to read her mind (she hasn't been to a grocery store in 4 years) and do things her way - and it never helped. Even when I went out of my way to do something nice for her, she'd turn it around on me. It made me angry at everyone.\n\nShe constantly criticized how I ate (too fast, too much, too focused on it - she called it the single biggest issue in our relationship and used it as an excuse to withhold all affection, even hugs) and I guess I just said screw it and became the person she accused me of being - stopped working out, started eating crap, and put on 20 pounds. We had a night nanny for the first six months after our kid was born, a day nanny since two months, and lots of grandparent babysitting - and my wife still expected me to do every morning with our kid; now she expects to sleep in every Saturday and Sunday, wants the weekend mornings and evenings off, and refuses to organize any play dates for our kid. (Along with many other things, they give her anxiety...) If I convince her to come to the park with me and our kid, she complains that I am eating into her workout time. She talks about people she knows who are manipulative, have anger management issues, are bipolar and taking meds for it, but never sees how she might fit into this.\n\nI started seeing a therapist a long time ago and found us marriage therapist options. We're on our second, who I really regret ever allowing into my life. She got to see my wife's true abusive personality and for whatever reason decided to rationalize and validate this behavior in our sessions. Privately she would agree that my wife was an abuser (though for whatever reason she didn't diagnose narcissism) but she would spin everything around on me when the three of us were in the room. My wife of course loved her. I went through this chaos for four months and then I left it up to my wife to make the next appointment, which of course meant it would never happen :)\n\nEventually my therapist convinced me to pick the couples counseling back up because she thought my wife needed a therapy outlet, even a poor one. The couples counselor decided she would become my wife's therapist as well. The sessions became increasingly bizarre after that - I asked if we could get there on time; my wife is chronically late, and I hated rushing in the door five minutes after we were supposed to be there. My wife accused me of being a tyrant who was imposing my own unfair rules on her. The therapist asked me why being on time was so important to me.\n\nMy therapist called up the couples therapist and basically told her to stop trying to do individual and couples. So now my wife sees her, and we don't go to couples counseling. My therapist suggested I start Zoloft, and my doctor agreed; at least now I don't react to most of the nonsense and I'm not angry or sad. I've also started humorlessly setting boundaries - some of which, after her initial anger, she actually respected.\n\nThen a few weeks ago, she criticized me for using my phone to order shoes for our kid - who was 10 feet away from me in the living room (and obviously she uses her phone in front of our kid). All I did was sigh - it was the first time in a month that I had reacted to any of her nitpicking - and she started criticizing me for being mad and it turned into one of those head-spinning arguments. I walked out of the house and after 20 minutes she called me and asked me to come back. I came in and told her I was done being her punching bag, done with her abuse, and she needed to come to terms with her mental illness and get treatment. She started crying and asked if I wanted her to leave and take our kid with her. I said yes, I want you to leave, but you leave alone. She didn't leave.\n\nShe spent the whole day \"reeling\" as she described it and not talking to me, then went to see her therapist the next day. She came back and told me 1) she was hurt that I had not reflected during the day and come to apologize to her spontaneously; 2) that I needed to apologize to her for making her feel abandoned. I told her there were a whole bunch of things she needed to acknowledge that are bothering me. She refused. I said fine, you go first, you get 20 minutes, then I get 20 minutes. She said no. I told her fine, I'm apologizing and I'll take it on faith that tomorrow you'll listen to what I have to say. Still no. Obviously she still hasn't been willing to address anything I have to say. (One thing she has started saying is \"We are both responsible here. I agree that I bear some of the responsibility.\" I asked her to name one concrete thing that she's done wrong and feels bad about and she wouldn't do it. Seems like the therapist has convinced her she's partly at fault, but she lacks the capability to sincerely acknowledge it.)\n\nReading about narcissism was a revelation today, and I'm still trying to figure out my next steps...", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I always repressed it in my brain and remembered it like it was a story/folktale. Of course, I\u2019m very traumatized and I will get anxiety and feel dreadful of my life because of it. I have horrible dreams of him. I haven\u2019t talked to him for about 3 years, he showed up to one of my aunt\u2019s (mom\u2019s side) choir recital- uninvited and told me to give him hug- of course I yelled no and ran out and had a panic attack. This happened almost a year ago, I\u2019ve always been paranoid to see him in public or that he will follow/track/stalk me. I am not a perfect person, but I would say I\u2019m living a lot better than some people who have been in traumas similar. After not talking to him for a few years, it disconnected me from some family members in fear that he would show up to family gatherings and such. Tomorrow, my bf and I are supposed to see my Aunt (dad\u2019s side) and some other family members at a water park. Thinking of going alone made me anxious and gave me horrible flashbacks of different parts of my life where I have seen my father abuse other people in front of my eyes. I lived with my father\u2019s 2737748th European girlfriend and she had a daughter and son around my age (F12) at the time (F11 and M15). One late night, my father got angry over a stupid xbox controller that he thought was broken, slammed it on the ground into pieces, looked for his girlfriends kids, the girl was taking a bath, he broke the locked door knob to both bathroom doors to terrify the girl while she was laying naked in the tub. He held the controller and wacked her with the wire and left. This made the brother come out to tell him to stop yelling at her and leave her alone, which ended up horribly. My dad yelled and punched walls and pushed the son into the game room. As all of this is happening, I\u2019m following him around telling him he needs to stop and he needs to calm down and kept saying it\u2019s not their fault. He starts to choke the 15 year old boy out, I could see his face turn purple and his eyes red in less than 3 seconds- his head looked like it was going to burst and His toes were basically the only thing touching the floor. I vividly remember that to this day (I\u2019m 21 now). I remember him teaching his next european girlfriend how to drive because she never learned. He basically abused her while she was driving for her first time with me in the back seat. At that point I knew it was wrong and I actually punched him and hit him from the backseat and yelled STOP THAT\u2019S NOT OKAY SHE\u2019S DRIVING, DO NOT FUCKING HIT HER. And his reaction was silent, then later said I did a good job and that I deserve something nice and expensive (he was poor as shit- poor as in borrow-money-from-your-14-year-old-daughter poor). He thought I deserved fancy cowboy boots for defending his girlfriend from getting bashed in the head and almost causing us to crash. And lastly. A vision I remember so clearly. Probably the deepest one. When he was still with my mother. I have a half sister (different dads, same mom) from europe who I met when I was two. She protected me from a lot of the abuse. When I was maybe 5 my mom was working her ass off to get food on the table, and one night, my mom just couldn\u2019t do dinner and my 10 year old sister was left to make dinner for me. She made plain angel hair spaghetti. I remember being told to stay in my room until someone told me it was okay to come out. When dinner was ready, my sister and I sat at the table with out spaghetti and apple juice. As I\u2019m looking at her making jokes while there\u2019s screaming and yelling 10 feet away from us. I just hear high pitch screaming from my mom, and I look over. He was dragging her by the hair on her head into their bedroom. I could just see my mom\u2019s pain, immediately, my sister spit her apple juice into the spaghetti to make me laugh- which it did. The door was slammed shortly after. And I ended up pouring my whole glass of apple juice in mine just to be funny. But that image never left my mind. \n\nI just had flashbacks and ptsd about those vivid moments and it made me anxious to see part of the family I once was a part of. (The only toxic part of the family that I know of is my father\u2019s dad (deceased) my father\u2019s mom (71) and my father (50 and almost deceased). I cut out my grandma because she could not believe us when we said he abused us and she continues to be manipulated by her own son who keeps telling her we don\u2019t talk to him because he doesn\u2019t give us money.

I always repressed it in my brain and remembered it like it was a story/folktale. Of course, I\u2019m very traumatized and I will get anxiety and feel dreadful of my life because of it. I have horrible dreams of him. I haven\u2019t talked to him for about 3 years, he showed up to one of my aunt\u2019s (mom\u2019s side) choir recital- uninvited and told me to give him hug- of course I yelled no and ran out and had a panic attack. This happened almost a year ago, I\u2019ve always been paranoid to see him in public or that he will follow/track/stalk me. I am not a perfect person, but I would say I\u2019m living a lot better than some people who have been in traumas similar. After not talking to him for a few years, it disconnected me from some family members in fear that he would show up to family gatherings and such. Tomorrow, my bf and I are supposed to see my Aunt (dad\u2019s side) and some other family members at a water park. Thinking of going alone made me anxious and gave me horrible flashbacks of different parts of my life where I have seen my father abuse other people in front of my eyes. I lived with my father\u2019s 2737748th European girlfriend and she had a daughter and son around my age (F12) at the time (F11 and M15). One late night, my father got angry over a stupid xbox controller that he thought was broken, slammed it on the ground into pieces, looked for his girlfriends kids, the girl was taking a bath, he broke the locked door knob to both bathroom doors to terrify the girl while she was laying naked in the tub. He held the controller and wacked her with the wire and left. This made the brother come out to tell him to stop yelling at her and leave her alone, which ended up horribly. My dad yelled and punched walls and pushed the son into the game room. As all of this is happening, I\u2019m following him around telling him he needs to stop and he needs to calm down and kept saying it\u2019s not their fault. He starts to choke the 15 year old boy out, I could see his face turn purple and his eyes red in less than 3 seconds- his head looked like it was going to burst and His toes were basically the only thing touching the floor. I vividly remember that to this day (I\u2019m 21 now). I remember him teaching his next european girlfriend how to drive because she never learned. He basically abused her while she was driving for her first time with me in the back seat. At that point I knew it was wrong and I actually punched him and hit him from the backseat and yelled STOP THAT\u2019S NOT OKAY SHE\u2019S DRIVING, DO NOT FUCKING HIT HER. And his reaction was silent, then later said I did a good job and that I deserve something nice and expensive (he was poor as shit- poor as in borrow-money-from-your-14-year-old-daughter poor). He thought I deserved fancy cowboy boots for defending his girlfriend from getting bashed in the head and almost causing us to crash. And lastly. A vision I remember so clearly. Probably the deepest one. When he was still with my mother. I have a half sister (different dads, same mom) from europe who I met when I was two. She protected me from a lot of the abuse. When I was maybe 5 my mom was working her ass off to get food on the table, and one night, my mom just couldn\u2019t do dinner and my 10 year old sister was left to make dinner for me. She made plain angel hair spaghetti. I remember being told to stay in my room until someone told me it was okay to come out. When dinner was ready, my sister and I sat at the table with out spaghetti and apple juice. As I\u2019m looking at her making jokes while there\u2019s screaming and yelling 10 feet away from us. I just hear high pitch screaming from my mom, and I look over. He was dragging her by the hair on her head into their bedroom. I could just see my mom\u2019s pain, immediately, my sister spit her apple juice into the spaghetti to make me laugh- which it did. The door was slammed shortly after. And I ended up pouring my whole glass of apple juice in mine just to be funny. But that image never left my mind. \n\nI just had flashbacks and ptsd about those vivid moments and it made me anxious to see part of the family I once was a part of. (The only toxic part of the family that I know of is my father\u2019s dad (deceased) my father\u2019s mom (71) and my father (50 and almost deceased). I cut out my grandma because she could not believe us when we said he abused us and she continues to be manipulated by her own son who keeps telling her we don\u2019t talk to him because he doesn\u2019t give us money. (Which doesn\u2019t make sense because he never had money to begin with). \n\nI appreciate anyone who read this, please comment, I\u2019ve never shared this before, especially in writing. Thank you for reading some bit of my trauma.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I normally know how to navigate her and I guess it's my own complacency that made me assume I could take all her behaviours in stride, but here we are.  I don't really want to get into the details of our relationship because it's long and messy and we could have both behaved better, but before I was with her I'd reached a point where I was confident and self-assured and had my mental health under control.  Post relationship I was a wreck and I now have severe social anxiety and my self esteem is just flatlined.  Of course when you meet her she's the most engaging, charismatic and lovely, confident individual you'll ever possibly find...  I can't cut off from her because she looks after my kid.  And I really thought I'd gotten to a point where I could maintain minimum distance and stay unaffected by her if/when she attempts to wrangle something out of me, except my kid came to visit last week, which was great, then afterwards I asked her if he was doing alright; she said yeah and then told me there was something she needed to talk to me about... but that she wants to wait 'until I'm more stable and she isn't hormonal'.... Except my mental health has been on an uptick for the last few months and I haven't experienced any severe downs for a while, so as far as stability goes I'm doing pretty good.  Naturally this has triggered my anxiety and I didn't say anything for a couple of days, texted her back and asked her to talk to me because it isn't fair to say something like that and make me wait.  She said it's nothing to be anxious about but she doesn't want to have conversations that will make me uncomfortable because 'I can react badly when I'm told something I don't like and she doesn't want that on her conscience'.  I have absolutely zero clue what she means and I feel like she's doing this to have some power over me and she can drip feed me information at her leisure knowing I'm going to be worrying.  I asked if it was about my kid and she just said 'nope' and that she was tired and going to bed.  Now I've spent the past two days unable to think of anything else going to the worst possible places and getting pretty much panic attack level about every single possibility.   I haven't said anything else to her because I know it's pointless and I figure she'll enjoy knowing she's twisting me into knots.  And I feel absurd because I know I get to these points where I think oh yknow maybe this whole idea of her being a narc is something I invented to cope with and explain how messed up things were, and then I'm back here, losing my mind.  I hate feeling like I wish I'd never met her because there are things I don't regret that resulted from that relationship and I really value and don't want to lose them but I wonder who and where I'd be right now if I hadn't and didn't have to deal with someone who makes me feel like this.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

{"post_id": "ci6b4l", "created_utc": 1564164498, "title": "Seeking perspectives: Is this a boundary issue or sexual abuse?", "author": "ICanTellTheFuture", "self_text": "Hi all,   \n\n\nContext: I am currently an adult living in a different city than my parents and I have had a variety of therapists throughout my life. Most recently, the therapist I had (I had to stop seeing for a variety of reasons) helped me with immediate concerns (death of my best friend, coping with grief, etc). I have worked through a lot and come very far but I have been trying to process my childhood and in beginning with a new therapist, I'd like to organize my brain so I can go in with a plan - if I do not have a plan, at the very least I'd like to have the language to describe what happened in my household growing up. I have never really discussed the following with anybody so if I could get some perspectives on what to even call this, it would be immensely helpful to me in trying to organize my thoughts and emotionally process this.  \n\\-\n\nBackstory: The more I think of my parents, the less stable I feel. They were certainly emotionally abusive and neglectful (father drank more than he should have, mother was always emotionally unavailable). When I was young, my mother would physically abuse me using objects around the house (e.g. hitting me with belts when I was about 2-3 years old).  \n\n\nI have difficulty with trust... but I am currently in a stable relationship and even though my partner is amazing, I feel intense shame - particularly around sex, desire, being naked, etc. I think a part of it is simply growing up in a society wherein women are shamed for being sexual (plus, I am a lesbian so the notion that lesbianism is inherently perverted probably also plays into this). I have come to recognize that aside from shame I do also experience problems with boundaries. I have worked on it a lot, but I still feel the urge to ask invasive or inappropriate questions or I bring things up at entirely the wrong time.   \n\n\nAs I began deconstructing these things in my mind, I have reflected on the reality that my parents did not have good boundaries when I was growing up. They spoke to me like an adult and it was completely inappropriate. For example, my mother told me about her traumas (e.g. being r\\*ped repeatedly by a previous employer) when I was not mature enough and completely emotionally unprepared to hear anything like that. My father forced me to listen to him discuss emotionally cheating on my mother by explaining the crushes he had on other women. He would ask what I thought about \"dry periods\" in my parents sex life (\"Is not having sex for x amount of years weird?\").  My mother would regularly walk around naked. But, to be honest, that was probably one of the least weird things about my childhood. I never really thought of it as weird, but I do think of it as weird in combination with everything written here.  \n\\-  \n\n\nMy concerns: As I have thought about it more, there were explicitly inappropriate things my parents did and, because they do not have good boundaries, I'm unsure of how to conceptualize it in my mind. Please forgive me for describing things in a \"weird way\" or something. I have never outlined this to anyone before. \n\nFor all the \"processing\" I have done, I don't have many memories of being a child, if I'm honest. But, of what I do remember, I remember being spoken to like an adult, being very hypersexual myself, and other inappropriate things. When I was a child, I would touch myself compulsively. I didn't know what I was doing - I just knew it felt good and that if I got caught I would be yelled at. I don't know why I was doing this. I remember having knowledge about sex at an early age but I don't remember ever being \"taught\" about it. It seemed like I just knew. It frightens me a lot and I am quite honestly afraid that what I am remembering is not even the full story.   \n\n\nI digress.   \n\n\nAs I was growing up, I would regularly catch my father masturbating at night in our living room or on our balcony. When walking around at the mall or other public places, my father would see women and make inappropriate comments to me about their bodies. I vividly remember one time a female teacher I had as a child was walking by our place and my dad saw her (context: she had uh, rather large breasts) and he just started moaning. I was so disturbed and disgusted and ashamed and a variety of other feelings I can't even describe - all of them very negative. My father knew I was right beside him and I asked him to stop and he just kind of swatted me away. It sounded like he was watching p\\*rnography right beside me. I felt horrible.   \n\n\nAs I got older, and began exploring my own body, my mother shamed me intensely. By the time I was well into puberty I finally understood what masturbating was and that hormones affected my body in certain ways. But, my mother would burst into my room and basically attempt to catch me in the act of touching myself. When I was a teenager, I purchased sex toys and hid them in my bedroom. My mom would go through my things and signal to me that she had found them by leaving them visible, such as on my bed.   \n\n\nMy mother would burst into my room (really, at any hour of the day so it wasn't like I was loudly touching myself at 1pm on a Sunday or something!) and try to pull the blankets off of me and see what I was doing to myself. There were times this happened so fast that I didn't know what to do. She would know full well what I was doing but humiliated me anyway. She would pull the blankets off of me and leave me vulnerable and call me disgusting. Or, if she couldn't catch me in the act, she would ask me invasive questions about masturbating. She would ask me questions about my vagina or if I had \"broken my hymen yet\".   \n\n\nAs a teen I, like many other lesbians, went through a short period of trying to force myself to like men. The truth was, I was a naive teenager - about 15 or so - being taken advantage of by a man who was almost 20-years-old. I told my parents this. My mother was happy because she thought this meant I was straight (yes, she certainly IS homophobic). My father asked me a variety of extremely inappropriate questions including, \"did you make him c\\*m?\" or would ask me to describe in detail what I did to make this guys orgasm.   \n\\-\n\nConsequences: I have a hard time having boundaries and having a \"private life\". I feel like I need to tell my parents (and other individuals) intimate details about me or else, I don't know, something bad might happen. I feel embarrassed. I feel ashamed. I have a complicated relationship with sex and my body and also just keeping intimate details to myself. I'm working on it. But, when I see a therapist, I'd like to discuss this. \n\nIf anyone has ideas about to call this behaviour or what language I can use to talk about this, I would appreciate it immensely.

He had a huge problem with using all kinds of drugs whenever he could get his hands on them, and the day I met him he was tripping on acid crashing a halloween party I was at. He told me as soon as he saw me he swore to himself he would get with me (something I found incredibly romantic at the time but totally hoffirying looking back) and soon enough we had exchanged numbers and were texting day on end. I was super weary of him in the beginning because I enjoyed being single and he seemed way too intense with his feelings considering how little we knew eachother. But he always read me incredibly well and soon got me hanging out with his bad crowd, smoking pot and missing out on life as they were. My inside voice was screaming the whole time but somehow it was like being under a veil - and getting high all the time was definitely not helping with my unsettling feelings. He also was really careless with using protection when being intimate, and would often just say he trusts himself with holding back so we had \"nothing to worry about\". I managed to hold off for a year into dating without agreeing to officially be his girlfriend and I saw how that frustrated him. But he would do everything to make me happy and tell me all the time how madly in love with me he is and how he wishes I was his girlfriend that eventually I gave in. And that was when he officially stopped giving a shit. \n\nSee, up until then I held the keys to the castle, I was unobtainable; a confident and strong minded person who he saw as only a challenge. It was only a few weeks after our relationship became \"facebook official\" he went out on a trip with friends to another city and cheated on me. A few goddamn weeks. I saw pictures of the party on somebodys facebook page and noticed a girl sitting in his lap and freaked out. Thing is, by that time he had metchodically alienated me from all my real friends and family so that I felt like there was nobody to go for advice, nobody to stay with but him. Confronting him was a circus - he insisted I was out of my mind until days later I found the explicit texts with that girl on his phone and finally lost my mind.\n\nHe had torn everything from me and had the nerve to make me feel like a lunatic, so eventually I became one. I started throwing plates and furniture and beating him and he had zero emotion or any sign of regret on his face. He wasnt capable of empathizing with me no matter how many nights in a row I cried from dusk till dawn like somebody had died. I feel like he basked in my misery like a proper cartoon villain. The only thing he kept repeating to me with a monotone voice was that he didn't know why he did it. \n\nI tried to kick him out after being in his poisonous prescense just got too much and guess what he did? He went to another party and fucked another girl who was even uglier than the last one. If that wasn't the last blow to my self-confidence he also went and kissed his best friends girlfriend just to add a cherry on top. I heard everything the next day and his excuse was that he figured we had broken up since I kicked him out. \n\nI have no idea what madness posessed me to grab onto him with teeth and claws. Maybe because there was nobody left, my life was but a social exile's paradise and he was the closest thing to comfort. We tried living together for a year or so and in the end his cheating antics started to make feel just numb. That time he went and cheated on me with his ex, that village slut he used no protection with,  that old cougar he found while in civil service. I began feeling like I was living in a blur, time was going by fast and I was growing thinner and crying every day just from simply being alive. I didn't matter to him at all and he didn't have any words to comfort me. One day I realized it had been four years of this hell and I had to make a choice; I was to leave and never look back or just wither away and never know what was beyond life in a small bedroom where watching the sunrise was the hilight of my day. So I decided. \n\nMy mom came the next day, I packed essentials with me and lied to her and told my studies were finished and I needed to move back home. I'm not sure she believed me seeing the ghost I'd become but she did as I asked and took me back in. It took a summer of no contact and he managed to slither his way back in, first forcing me to let him have a talk with me and telling me that he realized how badly he messed up letting me go. I had already had time to be objective and start to realize all the toxicity around our relationship but I didn't know he was a narcissist. I got back with him for a year and then in the end left again in the same manner to live with my parents because I knew I couldn't live through round two. He tried calling me all summer again pretending to cry on the phone and telling me he was miserable but I got the last word by telling him to stop calling me and being pathetic. That was the biggest win I ever had in my life and I'm so proud that I finally got rid of him. \n\nLife was tough after that because I had to completely re-invent myself, get my weight back to normal and cope with my depression and feelings of guilt from getting myself into such a horrible prison of a relationship. I realized later how and why he was so succesful with manipulating me into being with him. He saw me as a vibrant and empathetic person who really wanted to help and understand him. I was an easy victim for sympathy but I wasn't so stupid to rush into a relationship so he started to tell me exactly what I wanted to hear while in the meantime manipulating me out of contact with my friends and family. He acted like the dream boyfriend before I committed into the relationship, and gaslighted me and tore my confidence apart by cheating on me with people who were so much worse just so I would look at them and think \"If he went to them something must've been wrong with me, I must not be good enough for him\" and tried my best to give him all of me to the very bone. In reality he was the worst match to me and he knew for sure that this was the only way to make me stay with him if he completely shattered me to pieces. Later on our relationship was just idling while he was out cheating on me to keep me at bay withering away. And when there was nothing more to give he let me go. I became useless to him, because what a narcissist wants and needs is constant care and attention, and the feeling that he is on top of everyone and everything. And when I became invisible he wasn't anymore concerned about me. \n\nSo to anyone reading this; if you're in a similar situation or have been in a similar situation - let go of that person. Don't check their socials, don't think about times together, delete all pictures with them, block their social media and don't blame yourself for being foolish or wasting your time. You were in a situation with a master manipulator and you're lucky if you even made it out, the only thing keeping you miserable is having any reminder of that person in your life. The sooner you cut all contact and let go of that past together and rather view it as another life that happened and now is the time to begin fresh you'll be able to see hiw great life can be. \n\nI wish you all nothing but love. Always remember to love yourself first. \n\nTL;DR\n\nI was in a relationship with a narcissist for five years and realized that narcissist use similar tactics to capture you and slowly deconstruct who you are. The faster you make a decision to leave and cut them off 100% out of your life the sooner you're able to heal and experience being happy again.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He was affectionate, the sex was great, we spent a ton of time together, I never felt like my presence was an imposition, and we very quickly became a part of each other\u2019s families.

I\u2019d be a fool to throw away what was essentially the best thing I\u2019d ever had.\n\nBut as time wears on, the pros column is getting shorter and shorter. We don\u2019t have kids, we\u2019re not married, we don\u2019t own a house together, and the things I cherished about the relationship are fading away, one-by-one\u2026It\u2019s gotten to the point where I have to engage in some serious mental gymnastics to conjure up a single justifiable basis for staying.

Lord knows by that point, he\u2019ll be saying it takes 3 years, and I\u2019ll just have to keep chasing that ever-shifting goal post for all of eternity, desperately waiting for him to put his stamp of validation on what we have.\n\nIf I\u2019m being \\*truly\\* honest with myself, the only reason I\u2019m still here is for that sweet, sweet dopamine hit he provides. When I\u2019m not in contact with him, I sit here obsessively browsing this sub, reading everything I can get my hands on about narcs, and by the end of the day, I\u2019m seething. But then I get even so much as a \u201cHey\u201d text from him and my anger dissipates almost instantaneously, I lose all my resolve, and I start racking my brain for those elusive pros again.

{"post_id": "ci9eiw", "created_utc": 1564179624, "title": "Help for an Abused Friend (child abuse)", "author": "spankedwalrus", "self_text": "One of my best friends (16F) tells me about the abuse she receives from her parents. Her parents are Indian immigrants, deeply rooted in a culture of abuse. The abuse includes verbal and emotional (degradation, constant yelling) as well as physical. The physical abuse is some of the worst I've ever heard of- she's been hit with hair straighteners in the face, pushed into a table, had her head smashed into a granite countertop, as well as constant slaps, kicks, and shoves nearly every two weeks. Perhaps the most creative they've gotten is verbally berating her until she cries and has an asthma attack, then holding back her inhaler until she's on the ground suffocating. They're awful, but careful- she's never had to be hospitalized for her injuries. Of course the natural response is to report them to either CPS or the police, but she'll have a tough time getting anywhere.\n\nNot only are her parents relatively wealthy ($200k combined income), educated government workers with a clean record, on the surface she doesn't show any of the \"normal\" signs of abuse. She has nice clothes, the new iPhone, is an excellent student (top of her class, taking every AP class, involved in everything), and she hasn't told any of her friends about the abuse except me because she's worried they'll see her as a victim. One of our mutual friends witnessed firsthand her dad almost hit her, so I know she isn't lying to me about this. She covers up her bruises when they do appear, and doesn't have any lasting scars. Although it's been going on as long as she's been alive, she's never told any teachers.\n\nHer older sister would be a detriment as well. Not only do her parents show blatant favoritism to her sister, they also have a hostile relationship filled with yelling and arguing. My friend is blamed for every argument the two of them get into, and often punished for it. In the event that there were an investigation, her sister would without question either downplay the abuse or pretend it doesn't exist. \n\nShe has no photos, no video, no witnesses except a friend who saw her dad *almost* hit her, and doesn't have anything to support her except the words coming out of her mouth. I couldn't even fault the police for ignoring her if she did come forward- with so little concrete evidence it'd be a sham of a criminal conviction. Of course they'd beat her if she ever did tell anyone.\n\nThe worst part is, because of the brainwashing she endured as a child, she's having trouble believing they're bad people. Growing up, she was told \"people will tell you not to trust us or listen to us but we're you're parents and we're all you've got\", \"we're your parents, we know what's best\", \"we do this because we love you\", etc. The way she explains it to me, Indian culture is highly focused on family being together forever, and abuse is dismissed as \"tough love\". She feels like she deserves it sometimes. The most heartbreaking sentence I think I've ever heard is \"the saddest thing is, despite everything they do to me, I still love them; I only want them to like me\".\n\nOf course, having grown up with amazing parents who I consider friends, my natural response is to wage war on them. I've suggested recording them- I've even offered to buy her pinhole cameras for secret recording. I've suggested defending herself and offered to give her a knife. My instinctual reaction would be to destroy them in whatever way possible- but the reality is it isn't that simple. Even if everything was successful and she were taken away from her parents- the options are an aunt and uncle in another state (also Indian, also probably have no qualms about hitting children), or the foster care system- which she says she's more scared of than her parents. She doesn't want to be removed from them, at least not yet. She just wants them to stop what they're doing and love her.\n\nThe other issue complicating things is college. She has stellar grades and is looking for a stellar career- astrophysics. She wants a P.hD., and is applying to only the best schools. With the cost of these schools, she needs her parents financial support in order to be able to go there. Which would be difficult if they were in prison where they belong. And herein lies the rub. \n\ntl;dr\nphysically abusive parents\nno evidence\nwants to stay with them\nneeds them to pay for expensive colleges\n\nAppreciate any suggestions, either to help her emotionally or tactically. I try my best to be her emotional support, but I'm going away to college in 2 weeks and she still has 2 years in high school. She's already attempted suicide once, and I talked her out of attempting it a second time. Arms are covered in self-harm scars. If she can make it to college okay then she's in the clear, but I'm seriously questioning her ability to make it to college alive.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I felt a lot of cognitive dissonance during this relationship, knowing thing's she did were not respectful or \"normal\", but excusing her. I am curious if anyone else experienced a relationship with an individual with the vulnerable/covert narcissist type? My ex always made herself out to be the victim, and seemed to depend on people feeling bad for her in order to feel okay. She was very insecure, and in turn seemed to want me to feel insecure along with her. She was demeaning in \"small\" ways in front of our friends and family and it was degrading. When we moved in together, we didn't have sex the first 2 months. I sincerely felt something was wrong with me, and tried everything I could to be \"enough\" for her. After many tears and begging to know why she did not want to be intimate with me, she said it was because she did not feel connected to me. It felt like such a slap to the face, as I had been trying to hard. Knowing that she regularly viewed porn, masturbated, talked about potential threesomes between us and her coworkers when she and I didn't have a healthy sex life, etc. made me feel so anxious and self-conscious. She completely stopped trying. I finally gathered the strength to end things, and she kicked it into high gear, trying and doing everything she could. We were on and off until I finally realized that she was not ever going to change and that I deserved more, and more self-respect. She used triangulation with a past ex and later her co-workers and others from her past. She seemed to get a thrill from my jealously, as I am not a naturally jealous person. I know we had good memories, but that does not excuse her behavior. I am hurt knowing that it was my first relationship out of the closet and it was so full of heartbreak and distrust. I will have one month of no contact on Sunday and I'm proud of myself. I am starting to see more and more things that were unhealthy in our time.

I would often get punished for very minimal and petty things and I was often forbidden from crying and I would get in trouble even if I shed a single tear. I think this made me lack in emotional development growing up because I had a whole childhood of suppressed emotions which has often led to me acting up even now until adulthood with bursts of yelling or self harm. I\u2019m in an abusive relationship right now, which really sucks since I just escaped a previously abusive relationship before this one. My boyfriend is very manipulative, lies about a lot, minimizes what he does to me, puts me down, he\u2019s just overall very emotionally abusive and has even been sexually abusive. I think due to this, he has become a huge trigger for me. He\u2019s starting to remind me of my mom\u2019s ex husband, who was my biggest abuser growing up and he was a pedophile towards me. I often think to myself about how my boyfriend\u2019s behavior mimics my abuser\u2019s. My boyfriend even does things with very aggressive body language and behavior then acts like I\u2019m unreasonable for getting upset about it or when I point it out. Example: When he doesn\u2019t get his way he\u2019ll stomp around and bulldoze his way through the area to act like he\u2019s avoiding me, he kicks my kid\u2019s toys around or sweeps them under the bed with his foot, he flails his hands around when he\u2019s mad at me with a loud scream-growl type of sound and has even done it hard enough to shake the entire car before, he clenches his teeth, and he often whisper yells at me so nobody can hear the way he talks to me because we live with his family. He always gaslights me and tries to make me feel like I\u2019m the problem and he never really admits when he\u2019s wrong unless it\u2019s on his own terms and after he makes everything blow out of proportion and severely upsets me. He often makes very rude remarks towards me and claims I\u2019m offended because I take it as bullying when he\u2019s not actually being a bully and being an asshole is just his personality and that he\u2019s not gonna change, basically making me feel irrational and dramatic. He says things to pick on me and trying causing mini arguments especially if I say something back especially to defend myself, then he\u2019ll turn it into a huge problem. When he does those things I always ask him to stop, leave me alone, I\u2019m done with the conversation, he\u2019s upsetting me, tell him I don\u2019t want to fight, yet he keeps pressing on and keeps going and always wants to upset me more. He\u2019s even followed me around or decided to throw out random threats or insults to keep fights going further and it just makes me feel like I\u2019m living with my mom again because she used to do that to me. Sometimes it feels like I\u2019m practically begging and pleading for him to stop but he never does. I naturally raise my voice (even when excited) when I\u2019m upset, it just gets louder and louder the more I have to argue or the more upset I am but it\u2019s not that I\u2019m intentionally trying to cause a scene and sometimes he breaks me down until I go into self destruct mode and just start self harming in front of him like hitting myself or pulling my hair because he just won\u2019t leave me alone and this doesn\u2019t happen very often, but it\u2019s only when things get to an EXTREMELY bad level and especially after me asking him to leave me alone. There were two times in the past where I did toss my phone away from me but not in his direction with an underhand throw, and another time when I kicked a trash can away from me because of getting this upset and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s comparable to me being abusive or a valid reaction to being treated this way. Am I abusive for raising my voice, the times I tossed things, or when I\u2019ve hit myself? I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s exactly the same as the whole \u201cmen asserting dominance by punching a wall\u201d scenario but I really don\u2019t want to be an abusive person and I struggle with this daily with feeling abused but being made to feel like I\u2019m the abuser", "subreddit": "abuse"}

The last year was torturous, but I was too scared to leave as I loved him. I felt guilty for him being angry so I put up with the criticism, blame and name-calling. \nIn 2017 I had a horrible accident. I was in hospital and rehab for months. Before my accident our relationship was really good the majority of time, but intimacy and an emotional connection was lacking. Any time I wanted to talk about our future or any possible commitment he would shut it down. It was my first serious relationship so everything was very new to me. He had been in a previous 7 year relationship, and when we got together he was very open about what was wrong with his ex. How she was demanding and pushy to get married and start a family and of how she only ever wanted sex to be romantic and all about her. He made out like he was so hard done by and so miserable in that relationship. I didn't realise they were all HUGE red flags until after we had ended. \n\nBack to my accident in 2017 which happened after we had been together over 5 years. He told me while I was in rehab that he was going to marry me. We told friends and family and spoke about where to have it. I had wanted a legal commitment, however because of his supposedly 'pushy' ex demanding it in his last relationship which is what he said ended them, I was scared to voice how much I wanted that. He also mentioned how couples counseling was the 'nail in the coffin' with them because she was complaining about him relentlessly and of how the bad things in the relationship she said were never her fault, only his. Another red flag.\n\nAfter my accident, things were ok until it was obvious that he was not dealing with the trauma of it and of how I was trying to cope with my changes. However I was getting professional support, and I went on medication per his 'demands' as I kept going 'crazy'. Working through it was very much a case of two steps forward, one step back. I was getting there slowly, and in many ways getting physically stronger. However his behaviour towards me was increasingly unpredictable and so emotionally and mentally I was struggling. That was intensified when he would refuse to get help, call me 'crazy' when I would get upset over things, and blame me for himself being unable to work or be the 'dungeon master' for a game of Dungeons and Dragons with his friends. \nI found out the passcode on his phone and sure enough when I looked through his messages to his friends, not proud of snooping but I was desperate, he said it was all my fault because I wasn't doing enough and he was doing everything and that he couldn't put up much longer with me going repeatedly 'crazy'. \n\nFebruary this year right before Valentines Day, I got upset because it was scary to get back on the road after 18 months of no driving, he yelled at me and said 'I just want to get to a point where I look at you and don't just see a burden'. Romantic huh? I still didn't want to lose him so I worked five times as hard to prove to him how much I loved him and that I wasn't a burden. It didn't last and he ended it after I supposedly went 'crazy'. In reality that 'crazy' was when I finally stood up for myself by confronting him as to why he kept refusing to talk about our relationship, him telling me to go away and not speak to him while in the home we shared, refusing to look at me or show me any affection. From going through his phone, not proud of that but his words and behaviour in the breakup didn't match, I saw that he has got his eye on someone else. He told two close female friends this right after saying how I was the 'craziest' of them all and of how we were both supporting each other through the breakup. He wasn't doing that for me, just continued to criticise, blame and get angry at me when I would give him a deadline of when he had to get out. When I showed any sense of control he did tell me that my accident didn't end the relationship, and that he has issues, but then he proceeded to tease me for wanting a legal commitment. \n\nThis new woman is a close friend of one of his closest female friends, and just his type. She is pale, quiet and intelligent just what he likes, what he liked about me and what he is most attracted to with her. She is the close friend of one of his best female friends, one that has been his go-to for complaining about how I wasn't helping myself and how he was trying his very best. The other women friends he told about this 'new' woman all encouraged him to go for it, but he said how he wanted to be single for a while to recover from the past 18 months with me. These women he told just kept telling him how incredible he has been to me, and of how he deserves happiness and should be so proud as I wouldn't have got to where I am now without his incredible support and all the sacrifices he made for me. His closest friends are all female and they have been taking his 'victim' bait hook, line and sinker. \n\nI was so infuriated to read about this 'new and improved' version of me as I just know that he will get his female friends to put in a good word for him, and share his 'sob' story with her. They don't know about the emotional abuse and wouldn't believe the 'crazy  girl' if I told them anyway. I know this new woman may not like him, but not long before he called me a burden he went to a party and complained to me afterwards how this hot, intelligent single woman was giving his twin brother all the signs that she was keen, but that the brother didn't go there. At the time he kept saying how oblivious his brother was with women, and I remember feeling uncomfortable how 'perfect' he was making this woman to sound. Unbeknownst to me this 'hot, single intelligent woman, was his friends close friend and by late May would be his new 'prize'.\n \nI like to believe in karma, and that he won't get love and happiness with the next woman. I cannot see how he deserves it because of the emotional abuse he has put me through. He referred to me as the 'love of his life' post breakup, and I know the ex before me got that label too. \n\nI am still trying to shake the 'crazy' and 'burden' label considering that I do know I will have health issues in the decades to come. Most of all it is  hard to shake because he tore me down so much that I don't know who I am anymore and it just keeps making me ask myself, who would ever want such 'damaged' goods as me? \n \nHow do I deal with this? I am just consumed by the thought of him finding happiness again with this new woman, and that it may have taken him nearly destroying someone else (me) to finally get his shit together so that he doesn't screw up a third time.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

This is going to give some back story to living in my parents house with a monster and asking for more or less affirmation that cutting my parents out of my life is the right thing to do.\n\nMy older brother, I\u2019ll call him monster since I have an awesome older brother too. Monster did a list of things to me that has left me with some mental scares including anxiety and reoccurring nightmares.\n\nTo begin, when I was 5-8 years old, whenever our parents asked for him to call me in for dinner he would literally drag me home. He was 6 years older and would sprint home dragging my legs through thorn bushes and over concrete. He would trick me to be near a staircase and push me down the stairs. He would hit my back just hard enough that it wouldn\u2019t bruise. He did the same to our other brother so I found those normal.\nBut when I was again 5-8 years old, he would wait for mom and dad to go to bed and he would sneak into my bedroom to play \u201ccard games\u201d. Which could have been anything from actual cards to Pok\u00e9mon  and if you lost you had to remove your clothes. He raped me god knows how many times even after our mom caught him. \nSo getting older into my 12-16 years of age he stopped raping me but didn\u2019t really stop hurting me. He choked me in front of my friend once for turning off his video game. He broke my bedroom door so it wouldn\u2019t fully close and thus could never be locked.\nThe monster would barge into the bathroom while I showered so I would have to break my parents room against locked bathroom doors. (Which we only had because the monster flooded the bathtub multiple times) he would come into my bedroom while I was changing. All my cries to mom and dad would be an eye roll and a he doesn\u2019t know better.\n\nThe monster is currently on legal disability and doesn\u2019t work. He can walk, talk and play video games and get into chat rooms with underaged girls but no he can\u2019t work. He has epilepsy and died for a minute in 2015. Poor monster. \n\nSo here is my predicament: earlier this year when I got married I told my parents that I refuse to be around him anymore. I mentally cannot handle the stress being around him brings me. He causes me so much anxiety and the thought of wanting a child terrifies me because what if he ever gets near them. \nMy mom defends him. When I confided in her at the age of 15 she called me a liar. She doesn\u2019t want the family torn apart. She reminds me that only bad people are mean to the mentally handicap especially their brother. She reminds me that therapy is for crazy people so she doesn\u2019t need it and if I go then I must be being hyperbolic.\nToday she called my decision to keep him away from me a \u201clittle falling out\u201d and when dads not listening she\u2019ll ask when I\u2019ll get over it.\n\nI flinch when my husband raises his arm too close to me. I don\u2019t sleep until exhaustion in fear of nightmares. I can\u2019t have people behind me because you don\u2019t know how they might hit me or something.\n\nI am moving in the next few months. I was going to cut my mother out of my life too. I wasn\u2019t going to give her my new address. Her positivity toward the monster and hostility toward me gives me fears that she may show up at my door with him in toe. \n\nThank you for any advice.

I have done a lot of work to become way more aware of when to spot it, but still have a lot of work to do on fixing what I subconsciously accept as okay behaviour, especially from men. It's like I expect them to hurt me. I know that might sound sexist but it is because the two main men I've had in my life boyfriend and father  let me down,  abused me and discarded me with no reason,  other than it suited them to get rid of me.  So I avoid men out of fear that they will treat me bad,  and I will either overreact and get very angry or else retreat into protective be quiet,  don't say a word mode,  which is my go to safe mode.  I know all the main emotional abuse patterns,  but when someone makes a comment I don't like,  I still wonder if I am overreacting,  because of my past.

I was thinking is this guy threatening me? I backed off from trying to get to know him,  and ended up just retreating, I can't believe I didn't leave then and there,  I never had a guy I didn't really know at all speak to me that way, I had no clue how to take it. It was very uncomfortable. It seems he felt I had taken control of the conversation and he wanted it back, and dealt with it in the worst way?

My boyfriend and this girl didn\u2019t know eachother but my ex did have a mutual friend that knew her. It bothered me very early on how much he would comment on her pictures and how often I would catch him looking at her selfies.\n\nWe would fight about her all the time, the entire 2 years we dated (the first time). He would swear up and down they didn\u2019t talk. Eventually we got into a massive fight, about her, and he dumped me.\n\nWe got back together after a year apart and I decided not to ask about any of the girls he dated while we were broken up. But, after a year of dating I learned that he did in fact quickly begin dating that girl for awhile after we broke\nUp the first time. Yes, I understand we weren\u2019t together so no, it isn\u2019t cheating. But, because he didn\u2019t know this girl, and would constantly talk to her online, then ended up being with her (which was my fear the entire time) makes me question if they had met or talked while we were together because obviously he was interested, and their relationship started very quickly after ours ended.\n\nI was extremely upset when I found out about this and reached out to the girl (calmly I will add) and simply asked how long they had been together because he had never been truthful with me. (I think he should have told me when we got back together the second time, regardless if I asked or not because he knew how much of an issue she was in our relationship.) \n\nShe responded really rudely and told me they were friends and he talked all kinds of shit about me with her and sent me a selfie of her flipping me off. She told me he told her my body was disgusting and he liked hers better. I asked him for more details but he refused to tell me anything and we haven\u2019t spoke since (going on three months).\n\nThis has all been very hard to process. I hated him for awhile, but now my hate has really shifted towards her. I\u2019m convinced she ruined my life. That if she had never come in the picture, we might have had our problems, but she wouldn\u2019t have torn us apart. \n\n\nI do realize that this isn\u2019t rational thinking and that there is a bit of cognitive dissonance going on here as well in my thought process, but it\u2019s very hard to not carry so much anger for this person. I think a lot of it is also jealousy because she is very pretty and has the job/life I want as well (literally the same thing I\u2019m going to school for which is annoying). \n\nI am so obsessed with this girl, and have been for years now! I would constantly check her Instagram when me and my ex dated, and now I still check to see if she\u2019s not on private just because I want to KNOW what she\u2019s doing. I sound so crazy but it\u2019s what this relationship MADE ME.\n\nI\u2019m angry she ruined my life and took him from me. They aren\u2019t even together now, and I still can\u2019t let it go. I really need help moving on, does anyone have any advice?\n\nIt was really embarrassing to open up about this and I really appreciate anyone that took the time to read, I am just struggling so much lately with this and I don\u2019t know how to show my brain that it wasn\u2019t just her that ruined my relationship, it was him too.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It took years. And now I'm out, looking back on the fog, the chaos, the time spent underwater. What scares me about how I got out is the role my external support system has played and is playing. I had people in my life lifting me up in tangible ways. Each day, friends and colleagues were showing me a reflection of myself that was so different from the one I was getting at home. So different it just couldn't add up, and it became a greater and more agonizing dissonance to grapple with over time--how can I be both this full, complex person that people look up to, appreciate, invest in, and love, while also being a pathetic, selfish, flawed person? How can I develop these close, meaningful relationships with others and then be devalued, ignored, screamed at, mistreated at home? \n\nIt took outside forces, outside support, to shine the light on how distorted it all was. And while I am so grateful for it, it scares me because I don't know that I would have had the strength to do it on my own. \n\nWhich leads me to be compelled to tell any of you on here who are doubting themselves, thinking that they might be the problem, etc., etc.:\n\n* You may be prone to self-doubt--it is something narcissists look for in a supply source--part of their work is already done for them with an open-minded, even possibly insecure partner. You need to trust yourself more. Trust what your gut is telling you about this situation. You are NOT crazy.\n* You need to stop listening to your narcissist. Stop letting them tell you \"what's REALLY going on\". You are NOT crazy. They will try their hardest to make you think you are, and are pretty skilled at it a lot of the time. They will find ways to bring in kernels of truth, prey on your weaknesses and insecurities--they know exactly how to keep you where they want you: subservient to them.  \n* You may not have the external supports you need right now (the narcissist in your life likely tried to drive others away) but know that you will have them in time.\n* Start building those supports. Spend time with other people, outside your life with the narcissist. Find positive people doing positive things. They are out there and they have a refreshing point of view that will help balance out the narcissist's emotional tire fire you're dealing with at home. Don't let the narcissist sabotage these efforts. \n* Believe in yourself. You are lovable and you will be loved again. The narcissist is putting a ton of energy into trying to make you think otherwise--think about that for a second.\n* Don't feel guilty for making the decision to leave. Most of the time you're trying to explain or empathize/sympathize with their misery and you've no doubt come up with a full profile of the reasons why this person has a hard life. Perhaps this is part of what is making you stay. Don't let that thinking keep you trapped: the narcissist is with you because you're pliable and meet his or her particular needs at this particular time. You can feel sorry for them all you want, but it's ultimately a one-way exercise. No matter what they claim in moments of panic, they won't ever, ever, *ever* love you the way you love them. \n\nMake a list of all the horrible things this person has said to you (and stop beating yourself up about the things you've said in retaliation--they drive you to actions you wouldn't otherwise commit, and they'll use it against you long after you've been asked to forgive the 1,000 far worse things they do to you on a regular basis), think of all the life you're missing out on while getting berated at home, and build yourself back up again.

As a result of her abuse, she was a massive cheerleader through my childhood (she went full speed ahead in the other direction by overly praising me) but at times would lash out and tell me I was emotionally bankrupt because I didn\u2019t understand her trauma. I was a child when she said this to me and as you can imagine, it hit me hard. She is in her 60s now and I\u2019m married with a child. We\u2019ve had so many ups and downs....more downs than ups since I met my husband and since I grew and ventured out to make real friends. I learned that there is nothing wrong with me beyond the usual human flaws.\n\nSo now her words sting less but I also fight back more. She now romanticizes the things that her parents and grandparents said to her. She used to tell me how her grandmother made comments about how ugly her hair was. She grew up hating the way she looked and hating her hair. While I was over her house today, she made a comment about my daughter\u2019s hair and I pushed back telling her there is nothing wrong with my daughter\u2019s hair.\n\nShe told me I was taking it too serious and that she didn\u2019t mean anything by it. That it was me with the problem and that she was asking a question and not accusing me of neglect. I told her she made a statement and that she didn\u2019t ask a question. She stood up and told me that her father said stuff like that all the time.\n\nI don\u2019t know if or how I can make her see that she\u2019s continuing this cycle of abuse. I\u2019m trying to deal with it by limiting communication and keeping it to \u201cbus stop\u201d conversations (e.g. \u201cnice weather today, isn\u2019t it?). But it just feels like she just pushes buttons, then gaslights me, and then turns it around like I\u2019m doing something to her.\n\nIt\u2019s so exhausting.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Clean up every night before I go to bed. Clean up any mess I see that I didn't make. I make them tea at night for their tablets , wash her nebuliser mask , rub her back , run here and there to get stuff , stop what I am doing to make a cup of tea for her , Dry her after the bath , Make my own dinner from stuff she buys me because I am a vegetarian and I give her my money every 2-3 to help.\n\nI don't work and I have been in a course for 2 years that just ended so the money I give her is from my student grant that I get given every 2-3 months which she knows what date I get it at and I don't know which is really annoying as she counts down the days. But before I started my course 2 years ago my Aunt Annie tried to convince my granny that I would get up to \u00a32000 every year and had her convinced of that, so not only was I nervous about starting tech/college, I now had to worry about payments with my granny. When I found out from a source that I don\u2019t get \u00a32000 every year I was afraid to tell my granny to incase she went mental at me. When  I did she was like \u201cBullshit, how did your aunt mary\u2019s daughter get that money?!\u201d and I had to explain it may be a different course? Different circumstances? And then I told her this is why I didn\u2019t wanna tell her as she would have taken my Aunt Annie\u2019s words as gospel and now she has convinced herself I am hiding the money from her.\n\nWhen she thought I was getting \u00a32000 every year she thought it was given at once \u2026 What I did find out was she wanted \u00a31000 of that money for herself.  So imagine my reaction when I myself found out I would be getting \u00a32000 over 3 payments over the year however the only thing  I could do was every 2-3 months that my money would come in around \u00a3735? I would tell her I only get \u00a3500 and give her \u00a3200-250 and then pocket my \u00a3250-300 and then the reminding \u00a3235 to give me a total of roughly maybe \u00a3500 that I needed fo myself, I didn\u2019t have a winters coat , my boyfriend who works at a shoe shop had to buy me shoes at the start of the year because mine was falling apart. I needed this money to actually be a 20 year old and have a life with going out for food, need clothes. Unlike my granny who has her kids young and got married young. I wanted to have a life.\n\nHowever to add if I missed a lot of days my money would go down but I always still gave her money \u00a3200-250 even if I ended up with only \u00a3400 out of my \u00a3735. However, in my house my granny expected me to take days off because I took a day off the other week because I was sick or I needed the day off to focus on work or whatever and now she needs me to take the day off to mind the house, good shopping, pick up my cousin. It\u2019s fine for me to take the days off as it is my degree but when someone asks you to take your day off for them it then opens up your eyes to \u2018you don\u2019t care about my education\u2019 and she didn\u2019t funny enough , she didn\u2019t know the name of my course or what it even was , she didn\u2019t know my teachers when though I tried to talk about them , she didn\u2019t know what campus I even went to but she was able to tell me when my grant would be in.\n\nAnyway sorry for the long intro but here is the actual story\n\nWhen I was younger my uncles would give house keep because they were working and never cleaned the house from what I can remember. But that when times were different then than they are now and every 2-3 months I have to get her \u00a3200-250 out of my grant to go toward the house which has now stopped as I am done my course and going into a different one where I won\u2019t get a grant but a loan.\n\nRight now I have my uncle staying with us that have been staying here since my grandfather went into hospital in May (he is okay now) \u2026but when my grandfather was in hospital I scrubbed the house , cleaned everything all by myself, my granny would wake me up at 6am to clean the house while she did nothing and then complained about how when she runs the hospital it gets done (me doing it not her) and when my grandfather runs the house it isn't the way hers is as I am the one cleaning when she is 'running the house' and it is my brother , me and my grandfather who clean the house when he 'runs' it . When he was at hospital and out of hospital I had to take days of tech/college to look after the house and even got interrupted doing my coursework which is 90% of my final grade , If I get interrupted while doing work it takes me ages to get back in the 'zone' only to be called again and again so many projects went unfinished or were delayed and I was told I could 'do them later' without any regard on the length or duration of the project.\n\n I mostly ended up getting to college/tech exhausted , sore and just drained and no help to my group  . My uncle comes and goes and pays no money, eats our food, causes fights with me and my brother, takes my grannies phone to go onto Facebook, leaves messes everywhere that I have to clean, takes drugs in our bathroom even though he denies it. A story for another time.\n\nAnyway, I have a feeling my granny is nicer to her actual kids that her grand-kids. I went to therapy not too long ago and my therapist even told me I was cinderella.There is more to talk about which I will one day but for now, I wanted to know is it ridiculous to ask someone to pay to live in a house that they clean up and look up after?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I'm currently going through the process of gathering up financial info to send to my lawyer as part of our separation agreement. We live in Ontario and were together for 6 years, so considered common law spouses. We both agreed verbally not to go after each other's assets (my pension and house, his company). I just want a legally binding document to protect myself.\n\nMy lawyer recommended a formal separation agreement, the document we had drafted would not hold up in court should it be contested -- he called it a 'kitchen table agreement'. A formal agreement would protect me in the future should he come back a couple of years from now demanding things.\n\nWhat are some of the experiences that people have had going through this process? Gathering up all the info the lawyer has requested has been very stressful. I feel very vulnerable handing over this information knowing that my ex and his lawyer will have access to it. I know I will have access to his but I honestly don't care or want to know it as I am not interested in any of it, I just want myself protected against him, yet again. I also don't trust any of the information he will provide. I'm afraid that the information may be used against me in some way. I'm not well off, but I'm not destitute and I don't have endless amounts of money to pay my lawyer should my ex want to push things.\n\nI've made the decision to not act out of fear and provide my lawyer with all my info as I trust him to protect me.

{"post_id": "cio2db", "created_utc": 1564267413, "title": "Covert Narcissist Ex Fiancee", "author": "Ctr9114", "self_text": "  Hey everyone. Sorry for this long post, but I felt the need to vent and this community has honestly helped me since I discovered it a week ago. My Narc ex Fiancee left me a month ago, we were supposed to be married in November. It was one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. It was completely unexpected, and I was totally blind sided by it. I am from the United States and she is from France. We had been dating for 2 years, and engaged for 1 year. We were going through the K1 Fiancee Visa process, and on the day of her interview at the embassy and even days before that she was still telling me how she was so excited to be back in the United States and that she loved me so much and couldn\u2019t wait to marry me. Well 2 days after the interview, she discarded me. She met a new group of friends while in Paris, and I am pretty sure a new guy. I started getting nervous a few days before the interview, because she was out with these new people, and she was telling me for like 30 minutes how they thought she was so amazing and beautiful and intelligent and all this great stuff and she was having so much fun. For the last two years in the United States she basically refused to make friends here, and anyone who introduced themselves to her she would barely even say hi and then look away. I think it was because she didn\u2019t have that superior feeling over them because they all had good jobs and careers, and her friends back in France were essentially no bodies with no real careers, while she had a MBA and masters degree, but despite that the only real work she had done was an apprenticeship with a director at her company. But still that\u2019s better than what her friends had done and she could make herself the center of attention and enforce her superiority over them because of that. But in the United States she was essentially a nobody and had no real way of expressing her superiority over my friends who were the same age as her but already way more successful and farther along in their careers than her. But my nervousness came from this. I didn\u2019t want her to not go hang out with friends, but after two years of her basically refusing to make friends, and always acting miserable when she was around my own friends, it put me on edge.\n\nMoving forward, her reason for leaving she said was because I was too depressed for her to return, and that she wanted me to figure my life out and get back on my feet before she could come back to me. I admit I was unhappy about my job. I was working for her parents family business. They set up a company here and I was running as an accounts manager. I was also mostly working out of the house we lived at, and had no more work friends to go out with as I was the only person working for their company here. All of my personal friends were usually too busy to go out as well due to traveling or studying for business school. So I sat in a house for 6 months like it was a prison. Despite that I was totally in love with my Ex-Fiancee. I thought she was perfect. She was incredibly intelligent, feminine, stylish, loved to cook and take care of me all the time. For the most part we had no issues, and agreed on most stuff. I thought she was my dream girl. \n\nAs mentioned, a month ago she finally discarded me, and I legitimately went into a deep depression and had to get therapy because in my mind everything was my fault and I wanted to change for her. I couldn\u2019t eat, I had breakdowns and received a continuous barrage of facetime calls and texts from her saying how everything was my fault and guilting me for the wedding being cancelled. 3 days after the discard, she admitted to me that she used my \u201cDepression\u201d as an excuse to stay in Paris with her new friends. Then immediately afterwards continued to blame me and say I was responsible and that I pushed her away from me because of my dependence on her, my jealousy, and my inability to speak openly with her. Then she began playing head games with me for the next 3 weeks. She would start saying how much she missed me, and really wanted to come back, then right after tell me how much fun she was having with her new friends in Paris and that she considered these people her family. (She came from a kind of dysfunctional family, and was never really entirely close with them). Then again a few days later she would tell me again how much she missed me, then immediately after, start talking about her friends and how awesome they were and she didn\u2019t think she wanted to come back. It was such an emotional rollercoaster and drained me emotionally and mentally. One morning she sent me a picture of her new \u201cfamily\u201d. She told me they did a photoshoot and that she was so happy with them. Looking back this was all to provoke me as she wanted me to break up with her so she could be the victim. However I didn\u2019t do that and I told her how happy I was for her that she was having fun and enjoying time with friends. 3 hours later she facetimed me and told me that we were officially done. I immediately went into no contact with her. A day later after no contact she messages me that she missed me. I ignored it and went out with my friends later that night. The next day was my birthday. She sent me a long text telling me happy birthday and how sorry she was for how things turned and that she loved me. I was getting the sense that she wanted to come back. And later that morning she called me. Only to tell me how she was mad at me for having fun the night before with my friends\u2026Her reasoning was that she thought it was weird that I was sad before the break up and immediately after the breakup I could suddenly go out with my friends for birthday drinks. I hung up the phone after she said that. Then she starts texting me again with how happy she was in France with her new friends, but she loved me and wanted to come back but didn\u2019t know what to do. I continued to ignore and go back into no contact. Finally a few hours later she called me again to bitch at me about talking to one of her best friends a few days prior. I talked to her best friend in order to explain why I had issues with speaking openly with her and why I had jealousy issues and that I wanted her to speak with her as sort of like a mediator for us. My NEX was very controlling and never let me do anything to help around the house. She would always demand I go sit down and relax when I tried to clean the kitchen or do the dishwasher, and physically block me from doing this. Not in a violent manner, but basically just repeatedly getting in front of me so I couldn\u2019t do the task. Any time I had even just a small critique of her she would get extremely passive aggressive and say I was wrong and that I needed to stop talking to her  like I knew what I was talking about. In regards to the jealousy. She was repeatedly keeping guys around who had no business being near our relationship. I never cared that she had a lot of guy friends, and no issues with her hanging out with or talking to guys when she went back to visit France. However I had an issue with one guy who was always texting her. I knew about their past history. They didn\u2019t date but my ex was crazy about him and wanted to date him. He ended up dating another girl instead but my ex continued to chase him for a year. Only when she decided to move to the USA to be with me did this guy suddenly start pursuing her. She even invited him to stay with us 2 months into our relationship. She would also always get super discreet when he texted her and she would never talk about him like she did with guys who she was actually good friends with. Also In the first month of our relationship she had her last sex friend visit us for two weeks. It didn\u2019t really bother me, but what I thought was weird was that she would tell me about specific times they had sex together while he was right next to me. I never wanted to be jealous and controlling of her, so instead of telling her that comments like that, or the fact she was continuing to leave a door open for a guy who was trying to get between our relationship was bothering me, I just chose to bottle it all up. Because deep down I knew she would be pissed and just say I was jealous. \n\nGoing back to the phone call. She bitched at me for 30 minutes saying I was an asshole for saying mean things about her to her friend. Then started demeaning me and saying that she didn\u2019t understand how I didn\u2019t kill myself already because I was so emotionally weak in her mind. She was also saying all of this in front of all her friends. She started laughing at one point when I heard her friend say something in the background, at that point I hung up because I knew that this was not actually a serious thing for her. She just wanted to have an audience in front of her to be able to humiliate me. She then called me 20 times, and texted me saying I was a coward and that if I didn\u2019t pick up, I would never get to talk to her again. \n\nThe next day, she gave a half ass apology for being mean on my birthday. But we tried to be friendly with each other. Only for her to facetime me with her friend next to her just to show her friend how depressed I looked. And then texts me an hour later saying how her friend couldn\u2019t believe how depressed, skinny and tired I looked. It was like she was trying to repeatedly remind me that I was depressed for her own personal satisfaction. \n\nIt was after that I realized the type of person she truly was, and I went back into no contact. I also had a huge feeling of relief and felt ready to move forward. \n\nShe began texting me again for the next 3 days trying to act sweet and innocent, and I continued to ignore her. One day she even asked me to send her the company credit card details so she could buy things for work. She didn\u2019t even work for the company nor does she have a job\u2026It continued to make me realize she truly didn\u2019t care for me, she just needed money because her parents cut her off and weren\u2019t speaking with her any more, and that it didn\u2019t matter if what she was asking may be illegal or at least get me in trouble with her parents. She finally realized that I didn\u2019t want anything to do with her anymore and that I was trying to take back control into my life. She demanded that I withdraw the K1 Visa petition so she could travel back to the United States. I told her I would do it as soon as she mailed the engagement ring back to me. She refused and said she didn\u2019t understand why I wouldn\u2019t withdraw the petition. I know she just wants to hold the ring hostage on me so I am forced to see her whenever she does return. She actually sent our immigration lawyer an email calling me a cunt. But after that last exchange I haven\u2019t had anymore contact with her. \n\nI am not going to lie. I still think about her a lot. Going from supposed to get married in 3 months, and having this person tell you how much they love you, and then a day later they just totally discard you sucks. It weighs on my mind with suddenness of it all and the fact that she has her new guy supplying her, despite her trying to assure me before that there was no attraction to him. But for the first time since everything started, I feel better about myself. I am going back out with friends whenever I can. I am looking for a new job, and likely will have an interview for my dream job soon. I feel like my life is going to be just fine.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I had company and was having a few drinks and alot of good conversation and laughs. I look at my phone and its him. My heart didn't sink or skip a beat like usual. Infact, I felt nothing of that caliber except being a bit annoyed actually, lol.

The conversation (if that's even what to call it) went like this...\n\nHim: Oh yah baby \n\n(I looked at this text &amp; thought wtf, didnt reply for another hour) Me: Can you not \n\nHim: No problem\n\nMe: Please dont text me anymore \n\nHim: New guy? \n\nMe: That's really none of your business. Take care\n\nHim: Suck me off fuck\n\nI know I shouldve never replied... But I just wanted him to know that I dont care about him anymore - I dont WANT him to THINK he could come back into my life because this time around, I really am trying to move on and find someone that I can be happy with. I cant help but wonder why he texted me what he did, like what was the point? He was clearly drunk, as he always is on the weekends. But telling me to suck him off after politely telling him to just leave me alone solidified so much I already knew... He is an asshole who has no respect for women or people in general. In terms of what happened, I guess my question is, did I handle this correctly? I tried to grey rock him by not answering any questions, not opening up... like I said, I know I shouldve ignored...

Also, my Dad isn\u2019t my biological father, though he has been around since we were 1 years old.\n\n\u2014\n\nHi Mum and Dad, I know it\u2019s been a while. It\u2019s taken me some time to really figure out what I want to say, and how I want to say it. I\u2019ve felt a lot of different emotions at different intensities over the last 8 months or so, and fought hard to manage them. Therapy has helped put a lot of it into perspective, and helped me have more of an understanding of me as a person, and why I am the way I am. If I\u2019m honest, I think its also taken me a long time to write this because I was trying to figure out the perfect way to word everything, but I don\u2019t think there is one. It is what it is. You did what you did. I can\u2019t re-write that. I guess I\u2019ll just go with what I want to say and see where that takes me.\n\nThe last time we spoke wasn\u2019t a positive experience for me. Although at the time I felt like our talk about everything went ok, that was only because it did in contrast to when Sister tried to have a difficult conversation. There were no raised voices and I wasn\u2019t told to leave like when she tried to talk to you about a previous upset.\n\nNeedless to say, the conversation was not pleasant. When I actually thought about what we discussed, I realised there was no acceptance of responsibility from either of you, only excuses, deflection, denial, blame, and lies.\n\nDuring our talk, something you said really upset me, Dad. Saying it was Younger Brother who pinned me against the wall by my throat. We both know that isn\u2019t true, and was a quick-thinking move on your part to protect Mum. I guess you panicked at the idea of Mum being held accountable for assaulting a child, and as a result Younger Brother became the scapegoat. It makes me really sad that you automatically pinned the blamed onto him like that, like Mum\u2019s protection mattered more than his.\n\nDad, throughout the talk you seemed more focused on your own terrible childhood experiences, how you yourself were raised, and how you only had your own experiences to go on in terms of how to parent. I appreciate parents make mistakes and it doesn\u2019t look easy, but going by your own experiences of being bullied and tormented by your brothers, you succeeded in recreating those experiences and making your own daughters feel that same environment you grew up in. Instead of having three older brothers, we grew up with a bullying father who had complete control over our happiness and stability. You highlighted a range of things you considered noteworthy that you had done for us: collected us from a friends house and was threatened, didn\u2019t get involved in neighbourhood crime or activities, came home from a hard days work and had to deal with children. I reminded you then and I\u2019ll remind you now: that is called being a parent. These actions are not noteworthy. You will not receive a reward. This is called being a parent. Speaking of parenting, at one point you said you would never dream of doing to your parents what we were doing to you. Instead of being open to listening to what I had to say, you threw blame and guilt our way for speaking out. You painted yourselves as the victims, deserving of sympathy and pity, and we should be ashamed of ourselves for what we had done to you. You made me feel like I had come into your home and made a fuss about nothing, even so much as to say that you leave the past in the past. It seems this \u201cleaving the past in the past\u201d is somewhat selective, being as you have both cut off a large number of family members due to past actions and old grievances.\n\nMum, something I know you found hard to understand when we last spoke was the favouritism. You thought I was being petty when mentioning Younger Brother was cooked different meals, and insisted we were all treat equally. I didn\u2019t really explain it further during our talk, so I can understand if the idea of favouritism didn\u2019t come across well and I hope I can explain it better here throughout this letter. It wasn\u2019t just that Younger Brother got separate meals when he didn\u2019t like what was being cooked while I got told to eat what I was given despite also not liking the meal, it was so much more than that. As I tried to explain when we spoke, if Younger Brother didn\u2019t want to play football with Dad, that was ok. Instead, we were made to be the goalie while Dad kicked the ball at us, flinching and hoping it didn\u2019t hit us. We weren\u2019t allowed to stay up and watch films because we had school the next day, but Younger Brother could despite going to the same school and being a few years younger. We weren\u2019t allowed our own PS2 because Younger Brother already had one even though he never let us play on it when he wasn\u2019t using it, along with his many other game consoles. If we wanted anything of his that he was getting rid of we had to buy things off him, but if we wanted to sell items of ours we had to first ask if he wanted them and give them to him for free. This caused a lot of resentment, because we learned that what Younger Brother wanted, he got. If he didn\u2019t want to do anything, he didn\u2019t have to do it. It was the complete opposite for us. Mum, for a long time in his youth, you would enable Younger Brother to treat you like a servant. Thankfully he grew out of this, but I can recall on many occasions where he would yell at you from his room to get him a drink or something to eat while he gamed, and you would do it without question and bring it to him.\n\nMy therapist asked me what I thought about gender roles growing up. It caught me off guard and I didn\u2019t really know how to answer, but told her when I was younger I wanted to be a boy. When she asked why, I explained that I hated being a girl because when girls grow up, they have to do everything. Boys don\u2019t have to do anything. When we explored why I had that impression growing up, I talked a lot about the above, and how throughout my childhood I saw you, Mum, do absolutely everything. Cooking, cleaning, ironing, tidying: I didn\u2019t like that I had to do that when I grew up and thought Younger Brother was pretty lucky to be a boy. Of course the older I got, I realised that wasn\u2019t how it really was, and in fact you both just favourited Younger Brother, and Dad didn\u2019t lift a finger to help. Realising the latter was an eye-opener, and the more I thought about it, the more I realised I have never seen Dad tidy. I have never seen Dad cook. I have never seen Dad help out after you\u2019ve had a stressful day, Mum. I have never heard Dad say, \u201csit down, I\u2019ll sort tea out\u201d after you walk through the door after a long day at work. Then I think more about that. What else haven\u2019t I seen or heard Dad do? It becomes more upsetting to realise the rest. I have never heard Dad give you a compliment. Tell you you\u2019re beautiful. Express genuine thanks or appreciation. I have never seen him comfort you while you\u2019re upset - in fact, Dad often sounds annoyed at you for being upset. What have I seen Dad do? I have heard Dad make jokes at your expense when he knows they hurt you, and encouraged us to to the same growing up. I have heard Dad tell you you\u2019re stupid and belittle you. I have heard Dad speak badly about people having a job in the same role his wife has been working in for most of her career. You told me yourself about Dad summoning you from your bed to make him a cup of tea while watching football, even though you have work in the early hours - telling me like it\u2019s some funny joke. That\u2019s all any of this is portrayed as - jokes. And like we were told growing up, if we get upset that just means we cant take a joke. Frankly Mum, I have never seen Dad respect you.\n\nI\u2019d like to just say if you\u2019ve found this message uncomfortable so far, you might want to brace yourselves. I\u2019m ready to talk, and that includes really uncomfortable topics.\n\nAs we spoke about before, growing up, a lot of inappropriate comments were made about our bodies. \u201cfat ass\u201d, \u201cyour ass is getting bigger\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019ve got big knockers\u201d, jokes about if we go running we\u2019ll get black eyes, if we hear people clapping and so on. I\u2019m sure you can recall making these jokes, Dad. You would also pull out the pockets of your jeans and ask if we wanted to see your elephant. You would sometimes do this in passing, or come into our room to make the joke. You would show us the topless page 3 girls in The Sun and ask if we wanted to be like them when we grew up, and how we could get a job doing that. I can\u2019t describe the nauseating feeling from the pit in my stomach when I realised all of these were sexual references, and were crossing significant boundaries between an adult and a child. This feeling intensified when I shared an experience with Sister about you coming into my room in your boxers and shirt one morning and a particular part of your body was exposed. I was staring, though I didn\u2019t know what at, and when you looked down and realised, you tucked yourself away and left. I\u2019m not saying this was anything untoward, but you can imagine my horror when Sister shared a similar encounter. Going back to how differently we were treated, none of this happened to Younger Brother. No comments were made about his body, no jokes about his development. He was never told \u201cyour dick looks big in those shorts\u201d. Maybe that makes you uncomfortable to read. Maybe you\u2019re sat there thinking, \u201cmy god, that\u2019s ridiculous, why would we say that to him?\u201d, but how is it any different than \u201cyour ass is getting bigger\u201d, or \u201cyou have big knockers\u201d? They\u2019re still horrendously inappropriate things to be saying\u2026 And then Sister mentioned the bedroom door, Dad. About how you would be watching and trying to make us jump, but it would often be when we were changing and she would catch you and close the door; and how sometimes the door would start off closed but then it would be open slightly and you would be there. On one occasion Sister called you a pervert and Mum got very angry with her for calling you such a word. When we spoke about this, Dad, like a lot of what we discussed, you said how you don\u2019t remember these instances; but acknowledged that you didn\u2019t realise we were growing up and would just barge into our room, but that changed when Sister put a lock on the door. You followed this conversation up with \u201cIt\u2019s like when you go to the swimming baths and you don\u2019t want to look but you can\u2019t help it\u201d. Honestly, I still cant believe you actually said that.\n\nLike I mentioned when I visited, on another occasion you flashed your bum at us, and Mum got very angry with you. Absolutely everything was framed as a joke, and in their own instances you could perhaps frame it as a very bad taste in jokes, but put it all together and this is the horrifying picture that comes into view. This is what we have been mentally battling. This is what we have taken so long to process. Upon learning a lot of things about ourselves, we also learned that sexual abuse doesn\u2019t have to be physical, it can in fact be non-physical. It can be sexual or suggestive comments, showing pornography, exposure of body parts and so on. It gives me such anxiety to type that with the thought of sending this to you, but I want you to know fully what we\u2019re having to deal with. This has been a very difficult journey. It\u2019s only when we looked back at our childhood and really analysed it as an adult that we realised there were a lot of things that should never have happened, but that in itself was still hard to comprehend. For context of how hard this has been, Sister has only recently finished therapy. It was also hard to acknowledge how Dads behaviour was never really addressed, and even when we tried to talk about it with you, Mum, we were shut down. Wether it was Sister standing up for herself and calling Dad a pervert, or me confiding in you that I felt uncomfortable when Dad would back me into a corner and put his face incredibly close to mine, you defended him without really listening to what we were saying.\n\nMum, during our talk you seemed confused as to how any of this could be abuse, and referenced Relative dragging Cousin up the stairs by their hair, and how we had food on the table and clothes on our backs. If you only think of abuse as laying hands on a child or partner, then I can see how \u201cabuse\u201d could be seen as an unnecessary word for what we were describing. But abuse is so much more than that. Abuse can be physical, yes; but also emotional, sexual, financial or coercive. A lot of what we experienced was emotional. The most confusing thing about abuse is that it\u2019s not a toxic environment all the time, and the abuser doesn\u2019t have to be this nasty, vicious person. They can appear to have a softer side, while still being coercive and controlling. There are often moments or long periods of time where nothing bad happens and happy memories are made, but abuse is still abuse, and the good doesn\u2019t absolve the bad.\n\nI attended some training on domestic abuse a while back, and they had some information on what they call the different \u201ccharacters\u201d of abuse. I was kind of surprised at how much of Dad I saw in there. I\u2019ll send you a copy of the characters so you can take a look if you want, but I think you\u2019ll agree that Dad comes under The Headworker, The Bully, King of the Castle and some of The Liar. I\u2019d be interested to know your thoughts.\n\n\u201cRule number one, I\u2019m always right. Rule number two, look at rule number one\u201d. While often said as a joke, it was very much enforced. We could never be right, or argue against something that was unfair. It was drilled into us that no matter what, we were wrong and we should never question authority. After all, \u201cyou\u2019re useless, what are you?\u201d. (If you look at the document of characters of abuse, this is actually a similar example of The Headworker!) This kind of thinking effected my confidence, and to this day I struggle with self-esteem and confidence on a regular basis. I constantly think I\u2019m not good enough and doubt my own knowledge and abilities at work, despite the fact that I am considered an incredibly hard worker. I find it hard accepting compliments or praise because I feel like its just someone being nice and just saying that for my sake. I hold back on my opinions or suggestions in case I\u2019m wrong or come off as sounding stupid. Even if I know I\u2019m right about something and voice it, the second someone else says I\u2019m wrong I immediately doubt myself. I\u2019m not used to challenging behaviour or speaking up for myself, because I was taught that my thoughts and opinions don\u2019t matter. Like my therapist pointed out, I lived in an environment where I had no voice. Those comments about \u201cgetting a podge on you\u201d and \u201cfat ass\u201d had more of impact on Sister than any of us realised, and she only recently through therapy discovered she had developed an unhealthy relationship with food. I\u2019m sure Sister wouldn\u2019t mind me saying, but did you know she would consciously choose not to snack or do things like butter her toast because she didn\u2019t want to gain weight? She\u2019d try to burn calories on the dance matt, and even after moving out she had such a low opinion of herself that she prioritised house work over eating because that\u2019s what she thought a good house wife did, and eventually stopped recognising hunger as hunger. She has since seen a dietitian because she weighed less than 7 stone and thought it was normal to always be hungry. I myself can recall times I\u2019d look in the mirror, see the \u201cpodge\u201d, and think about how I needed to cut down on eating out and needed to exercise more. These comments created negative opinions about our bodies despite the fact we have both always been a size 6 or an 8. We\u2019re not fat, and we never were. Maybe you were afraid of having overweight children because you\u2019d find that embarrassing or something, I don\u2019t know, but you have always been harshly judgemental towards others. Even at a young age, I can recall how you would describe other relatives in horrible ways. Whether it\u2019s referring to Uncle as \u201cFatty Uncle Name\u201d, to Aunty 1 as scruffy with her scruffy kids, or Aunty 2 as a witch, there has always been this negative view towards others in our family. Admittedly I heard this from mostly you, Dad, but Mum would join in. It makes me wonder at what point in your relationship that Dad first started insulting your family members, and at what point you let him continue doing it. Regardless, it seems to have largely effected how you view them as people, like it did with me growing up.\n\nLike we mentioned before, the teasing would often get out of hand and move on to torment. We weren\u2019t having fun anymore, and often weren\u2019t having fun to begin with, but you were, Dad, and I guess to you that\u2019s all that mattered. I specifically remember Sister swatting and yelling at you to leave her alone, and you kept goading her into being angry by actually telling her to get mad. When we spoke about this, you told her she used to bully me and you were giving her a taste of her own medicine, or some such excuse. What adult bullies a child to teach them a lesson? In honesty I think you wanted to feel like your brothers, and wanted to feel in control and in a position of power and authority like they had over you when you were young. That would also explain making us eat dog food or suck your toe if we wanted anything, and I\u2019m left wondering if your brothers made you do similar things during your own childhood. That doesn\u2019t make it right, of course; and once again, none of this happened to Younger Brother. Do you see the favouritism now, Mum?\n\nDad, you also made a comment about how I didn\u2019t realise how poor we were. I appreciate we may not have had money all the time, but I can\u2019t help but notice that I slept on torn up duvet covers on the floor for 6 months after moving back home when Relative died, in a house where the front room was nicely decorated with laminate flooring, a large tv mounted on the wall, and there were multiple games consoles and devices, laptops, and cameras. Whether you want to admit it or not, that was straight up neglect. When I brought up my sleeping arrangements and the tortoise being put in our room, you got rather defensive, Mum. You claimed you cleaned up the tortoise\u2019s faeces and compared it to when we would let the mice run around the room and asked what about their droppings? I understand the point you were trying to make, but there really isn\u2019t any defence for that situation to have ever occurred. An animal that is continuously defecating as it wonders about should not have been allowed to stay in a carpeted, shared bedroom where a teenager sleeps on the floor. It would have been much more sanitary if he were on laminate, wooden or vinyl flooring, all of which where available options. It wasn\u2019t a case of being poor, it was a case of not being made a priority when I should have been. The fact that I wanted to go live with Relative in the first place should have indicated how I was feeling at home. Children don\u2019t usually go live with other relatives, but I don\u2019t recall anyone sitting me down and asking why I wanted to live somewhere else or trying to address the issue at home.\n\nDad, when we were young I remember you making us lean over the bed when we were in trouble and whacking a belt repeatedly next to us. You would then tell us to not do what we had done again. I didn\u2019t see much of a problem with this at first if I\u2019m honest, I mean, you weren\u2019t actually hitting us, it was just to get us to behave. Then Husband asked how it was any different than someone grabbing their girlfriend and punching the wall next to their head. I didn\u2019t have an answer for that. Part of my journey through this was recognising the double-standards I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d had. I would hear of how a friend was being treated by their abusive partner and be immediately horrified, but when it came to my own treatment as a child, I really struggled to see it, but I see it now. I might have to go back and read about abuse and do a mental check list in my head, checking everything off that we experienced, but I see it.\n\nI know you can\u2019t go back in time and change the things that happened, and maybe I would feel differently if there was some acknowledgement and regret, but your focus wasn\u2019t on how sorry you were, that you could see what was wrong, or how you could make it up to us. Your literal response when I brought up the fear of how future grandchildren would be treated was about how it probably wouldn\u2019t happen because you cant get away with things like that anymore. That doesn\u2019t tell me you see any wrong-doing. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t make me feel safe leaving children in your care. The \u201cjokes\u201d would continue, because you don\u2019t see any real harm in them, and don\u2019t see any of it as any kind of abuse.\n\nEven after our talk, there were no messages of regret or showing love. I feel like the idea of giving us space while we sought therapy was used to push us to the back of your minds, even though I made it quite clear that you were free to message, we just might not reply straight away as we needed some time. Instead when you did repeatedly message, Mum, it was nonchalant about a discount code for the supermarket that you wanted to share, which was so bizarre and hurtful. The idea that a discount code was a more important message to send than one saying you love us, miss us, and hope we can sort this out. Even now when you\u2019ve messaged asking if we have decided on what we would like to do there is no love shown, it\u2019s more a feeling of \u201ccan this be over now?\u201d Frankly, I have never seen either of you make an effort to fix a relationship, so I don\u2019t know why I thought we would be different.\n\nTo be honest, frustratingly, I still don\u2019t know what I want. When I think about us having a relationship it\u2019s very difficult to imagine what that would look like. You are so absorbed with your own wants and needs that you overlook everyone else's. Whether its Younger Brother's \u201cbirthday meal\u201d where you invite your own friends and none of his; being unable to apologise for an offensive joke, instead buckling down and ordering Sister out of your house; taking Sister to the pet store to buy rats for her birthday that she had begged you for, only for Dad to drive her home empty handed because \u201cMum said you could have them, but I didn\u2019t\u201d, and make her try to beat you at unrealistic challenges to earn them, or Now Husbands Step-Dad having a god damn heart attack and Mum telling my workplace to let me finish my shift before telling me Husband was trying to contact me - these are not the actions of people who think about others. Even when talking to you about all of this, it seems your only real concerns were about yourselves, asking me \u201cWho else knows about what you\u2019re doing?\u201d, and \u201cWill you be taking this further?\u201d. I feel like you\u2019ve really taken to heart the mantra Dad would say of \u201cAlways look out for Number One\u201d.\n\nDespite your flaws, you\u2019re still my parents and I love you. It\u2019s been a mix of easy and hard times not having you in my life. I found my birthday really hard actually, which honestly was a surprise to me. The birthday cards didn\u2019t help, and if I\u2019m being honest felt like a token gesture. Especially the one from Younger Brother. Intentional or not, it hurt to read a card that said \u201cyou will always be my sister\u201d on the front when I haven't heard from him in so long. I half expected there to be a little note inside that went on to say something more, but it was just the usual to and from, just like your card. Following the pattern, there was no acknowledgement at all of what has happened. But like I said before, our childhood wasn\u2019t all bad, and you love us in your own ways. But there\u2019s no magic wand that will change the past, or make us un-know what we have learned. When you can\u2019t change the past, the next best thing would be to take responsibility and do what you can to fix the present; but that\u2019s not what you did. Instead, you got defensive and angry that we brought any of it up in the first place.\n\nI will say, despite the waiting list, therapy really does help. If its something you\u2019d be open to, I\u2019d highly recommend it.\n\nI\u2019m open to a response if you want to continue talking about this.\n\nI love you. I miss you. I wish you all the best.\n\nDaughter x\n\nTL;DR: A letter I plan on sending to my abusive parents detailing our abuse and our struggle through therapy and how all of this has effected me and my sister.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I immediately deleted it. A few hours later I\u2019m doing some investigating on Instagram (his new gf is an influencer with an open profile) and I see that they\u2019re together. It\u2019s a long distance relationship so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re together everyday.

I have an ex-fwb whom i saw for  almost a year. We met on tinder but a friendship developed along with  the hookup. One thing we really bonded over was our abusive exes. He  told me his ex would go through his phone while he's sleeping, hit and  scratch him, break up with him every few months to date someone else  then beg to get back together, and insult his body..etc etc. They were  together for 7 years, and broke up 2 years ago.\n\nThe  benefit part of our friendship ended about a month ago because i ended  up developing feelings. It ended amicably until i found out he actually  slept with his ex, and it caused me to spiral into my own past-trauma.  He said they've pretty much hooked up every few months, and did their  own thing in between since their breakup. He denied feeling attached to  her, insisted that it was just physical, but from my traumatized  perspective i knew it wasn't possible, and i was right. We are back on a  friendly basis, and he just told me that he's basically considering  getting back with her. He went through a big life-changing injury (which  led to him hooking up with his ex again because she visited at the  hospital) and she has since been trying to get back together, and he's  considering it. Saying it's hard when someone is being open and  vulnerable, and that in 2 years people could grow up (he always said she  was abusive because she was insecure).\n\nI've  brought up my concern before, and he keeps thinking i'm doing it  because i of my feelings for him. I do like him, but more than that i  really care about him as a person. He's so kind and has helped me so  much with healing from my abusive relationship and i value him as a  person. I'm terrified that he's going to go back to her and get trapped.  I know a big part is me projecting my own traumatic experiences, but he  has told me A LOT about what happened between them, and it's awful. I  know there's nothing i can do, all i can do is voice my concerns and be  there for him, but i'm scared for him. A part of me would be sad to lose  him to his ex, but honestly if he's happy with her and she DOESN'T hurt  him anymore, i'm happy for him. I really care for this guy and just  want him to be happy and healthy, whatever his decision.\n\n\\_\\_\n\nTL,DR (get to the point ):\n\ndo you think an abusive ex-gf can change after several  years?

Just discovered this sub. I think it really hit something in me, reading through it.\n\nA few years ago, I got out of an abusive friendship with a N 5 years older than me. It really screwed me up--constant double standards with boundaries (i.e. you're not allowed to have an account on \\[x\\] website, but I am / you have to be here for my problems constantly, but you're not allowed to be upset when I ghost you for a week otherwise you're codependent, etc etc) and some... odd sexual stuff. I was a minor, but they expected me to roleplay sexually with them through fictional characters, they sent me bra and underwear sets in the post as gifts, all that sort of stuff. When I cut contact, they had a full-on narc meltdown and kept trying to call me, contact me through mutual friends, telling me I was a toxic monster, saying I would never have friends again without them, etc. I know they still refer to me as *their* abuser, and that haunts me. I had to cut off so many friends who were still in contact with them. I know I didn't behave well, I fully take responsibility for that, but I was a literal child and they were an adult. DARVO, man. \n\nSince then, though, I've noticed that I've fallen back into the trap of acquiescing to narcissists. This year I shared a house at university with friends who I didn't realise were quite as narcissistic as they proved themselves to be. Three people with seemingly low empathy -- one of whom was physically violent towards me after they had a narc meltdown, but refused to take responsibility because \"I was having an out of body experience!!!! You can't blame me! I'm not safe to be around!!!\" -- and all who displayed textbook narc behaviours. I was constantly expected to be on their beck and call, to listen to everything they had to say. They didn't listen to anything the others would say to each other (I remember once one of them posted in a group chat, distressed that their parents were screaming at each other, and another just said 'anyway, I've been playing the Sims, look at my house'). They never listened to anything I was interested in. They didn't even bother with my birthday--which feels like such a minor thing, but I didn't even get a 'happy birthday' from the people I was *living with.* They only cared when it looked like I had cake left over, lmao.\n\nI've gotten out of this living situation, now, but now I'm genuinely afraid. I feel like I see narcs everywhere I go. I recognise the narc behaviours in people in my family, and in acquaintances. I don't know how I keep finding these people, or how I'm supposed to find people on the same emotional/empathetic layer that I'm on. I'm just so scared of getting hurt by these  kinds of people again. Emotionally or physically. What do I even do, in this situation?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

TL;DR How do we deal with insensitive or just well-meaning but uncomprehending friends (not flying monkeys.)?\n\nI searched for posts on this to get some understanding of why some of my friends aren't getting this. I wanted to vent, too. I forget that friends can't understand what they don't believe or comprehend but I try to remember that I don't need their validation (which I'm NOT used to NOT needing). \n\nAlso, when there isn't context, tone, emotions involved, over-talking, circular arguments that these friends don't hear, trying to explain just makes me sound super nit-picky and intolerant. I would get so overwhelmed and felt so uneasy and unsafe around my Nex that the fog would make it difficult to remember everything that was said, or screamed, at me and when I try to explain to someone, I can't emote the same evil energy that occurred. I can never remember the horrific things he said verbatim, and the small examples I can give, seem like I'm overreacting or justifiable or me taking it wrong because there's no way to explain it. \n\nFriends seem to want to argue with me. I'm discarded, traumatized, shaky after all these years and because they can't see broken bones or black eyes, they seem to think not only that it's me overreacting but that I had more control over what he did to me than I actually did. It's impossible, it seems, to explain to them the push-and-pull, the lovebombing and devaluing phases and threats and destruction that crippled me. Eventually he discarded me to add insult to injury (and leaving me homeless) and for some reason, I get push back from some friends. \n\nI don't have many friends left because they got tired of this dance. Those I have left seem to want to argue with me about being so distraught. \n\n I just texted with a friend who actually asked me, \"Well, was it all that bad? I mean, you never really complained.\" \n\n1. I complained all the time and apparently you didn't give a shit enough to listen. \n2. I spent Christmas night with you and your friend, for example, because he'd screamed at me until I had to flee the house. How could you wonder if it was \"all that bad\"?\n3. How is that being a good friend to make me feel worse by making me question whether I'm overreacting about someone dumping me? I wasn't even the person who left, he was, and now you're questioning whether I should be upset over his treatment of me? \n\nNot to mention the ridiculous amounts of this platitude from everyone, even if it's true, \"Well, just be glad this asshole is out of your life.\" HOW DOES THAT HELP ANYONE?? Not now, it won't. You loved this person with your heart and soul and he lied and abused you and you still can't wrap your head around how much you've been betrayed and discarded like trash yet. This statement also makes me CONTINUE to wonder--perpetuating what the Narc was asserting: that I was untrustworthy and crazy-- what is wrong with my judgment in trusting this person when I didn't even really know him.\n\nIn this sub, it is appropriate to say to be glad they are out of our lives because we need to hear that we will get better  when the Narcs are out of our lives because here, we're learning that this isn't some normal breakup. But when it comes from friends who just want you to get over this \"breakup\" cuz \"everyone goes through them,\" it's extremely frustrating. \n\nI need some of these remaining friends, but some just don't know what they're saying.

She had previously blocked me on everything.\n\nAlmost a month goes by since that last convo, and I noticed that she had unblocked me from Whatsapp and Insta.

I know, it's silly, but I think sometimes even though I have read a lot about narcissistic abuse, there is still a part of be that doubts if she really is a narc and it's all in my head. i guess not.\n\nSo stupidly, I send her a message asking why she had unblocked me, she said that she unblocked me because she was no longer mad at me, I asked her what about the awful things she said? About her not wanting me to be a part of her life. I thought she would apologize, but no, instead she said that she wasn't sure she wanted me to be a part of her life, and that she wanted to set boundaries, like not allowing me to talk about the father of her son (she always talked shit about him portraying him like this manipulative abuser, but suddenly she claims he is a nice person), I mean, she used to tell me that she liked me to tell her what I thought about the guy, but now I was a SOB for telling her he is an abuser.\n\nThen she said: ok those are my boundaries. I am dating someone and I don't want your drama.\n\nShe just dropped that bomb and I felt awful, it was a devastating feeling. But somehow I kept talking to her for the next couple of days.\n\nA couple of days later I was talking to her and she admitted that the awful things she had said were meant to hurt me, that she said those things in order to hurt me and that she didn't regret any of it, I asked her why did she do this and she said it is because she is vindictive (then I realized there are vindictive narcissists), and she knew exactly how to push my buttons and knew what to say in order to hurt me. She said all these things with a smirk on her face, with no shame, no regret.  I tried to her more info from her and there was a point when she basically admitted that she is the type of person that if her boyfriend makes her mad, she will go out and sleep with some guy in order to hurt her boyfriend because she is that vindictive.\n\nThis hurt a lot, but confirmed once again that she never respected my feelings and many things she said or did during our relationship were meant to hurt me.\n\nBut that's not where the story ends. She also said that she is now dating someone with whom she shares a spiritual connection that she has never had with anyone else in her life. That she is feeling things for him that she had never felt for anyone else before, that she is experiencing things for the first time in her life.\n\nTHat hurt a lot because she used to tell me that I was the first man who she felt she was really interested in, that I was the first person who made her contemplate more things beyond just sex. But on the other hand, she also used to say that her ex, the one she has a son with, was the love of her life and that she had never felt the things she felt with him with anyone else. Less than two months ago she was telling me she was madly in love with him that she still loved him.... but now there's a new guy she feels all of those things for???\n\nIf that wasn't enough, she said that she is happy with this new person because they have an open relationship, that they can go to swinger clubs together, that she loves switching partners, because she likes seeing her partner having sex with another person in front of her or vice-versa, and that was something I couldn't simply provide for her because I am not into those things.  I understand that there are people out there who like this and I respect that, but knowing that the woman I thought I loved is doing those things, really hurts. I mean a lot of people are traumatized by being cheating on, now imagine watching your significant other having sex with someone else in front of you. If that is something you are not into, I bet the thought is unbearable for you.\n\nNow I have to deal with the knowledge that she is out there doing those things and being used for sex.\n\nI feel devastated, and the problem is that there is only a friend in my life that I can tell these things to, because no one else understands how I could put myself in that situation, knowing that any contact with her will hurt me, and still contacting. My therapist said that everytime I talk to her, I end up hurt. And she's right.\n\nThe suicidal thoughts have come again, and even though they are not as strong as they were 9 months ago during the first discard, they are back. I realize I don't want to die, because what I really want is to be able to move on from this evil person and stop contacting her.\n\nShe said that she wants me to be happy, that she wants me to move on and find someone else, be happy with a woman who can love me the way I deserve to be loved. And let me tell you something that I've learned about her and maybe some of you can relate to your own abusers: when she says all those things, she is so composed, she doesn't look crazy, nor evil, she doesn't speak like a crazy person, she speaks like someone who genuinely cares for me, but then again there is the smirk on her face when she told me that she meant to hurt me when she said those things and she did not regret anything, that she knows my buttons and she likes to press them when she is mad at me because it makes her feel good to be vindictive.\n\nPlease help. I feel like it's all my fault for breaking NC once and again, but I feel like when she unblocked me, it was her hoover attempt, she didn't have to talk to me first, she knew that by unblocking me, i would talk to her, and then she would tell me she is dating someone else. Why did she do this? Couldn't she just date the other person and not unblock me? If she is so happy with this person, why couldn't she just keep me blocked?

Sorry for grammar issues. I'm extremely self-conscious about writing my thoughts down so please bear with me.\n\nA few years ago my mother got remarried to a very mentally abusive military man. At the time I was a very naiive child, and I'd known nothing but luxury and prosperity until that point in my life. Things changed very drastically when, for the first time in my life, we began living in a shitty flat in an even shittier town. He moved in shortly after we moved there and that's when our lives changed forever. I remember he never liked me. He never really liked anyone except my mom but he really didn't like me especially and I never really found out why. I'm not going to go into the things he did to my family unless I find the courage or support to do so, but needless to say things got very bad very quickly and stayed that way for a couple years. Eventually my mom mustered up the courage to form a risky plan to separate our family from him and very luckily she succeeded. Unfortunately by that point I'd already attempted suicide three times and was completely hollow by then. Now this is where my problem really begins, and this is what I'm trying to really write about.\n\nI spent so much time fearing life just as much as I feared death that I'd broken myself down to nothingness and I felt that way all through the rest of my High School years. I thought that once I graduated that things would get better and I could use the lessons in morality that I learned from my situation to further my growth into who I wanted to be. I've been out of High School a year now and I just can't acknowledge any real progress. I've been in and out of countless different Therapists offices and groups and mental institutions for a multitude of different reasons, but felt nothing conclusive or even helpful really. I've tried different coping skills and mindfulness exercises and even tried exploring new hobbies and locations around the world, but nothing entices me for more than a fleeting moment and I feel no lasting connection between anyone anymore. I have one very close friend and a small handfull of understanding family members but my constant barriers I have up means I never drop my guard for a minute. I'm always fantasizing about how people will betray me or how I'll betray myself and it's becoming maddening. Hell, the reason I write this here is because I just had a conversation with the ceiling about my darkest feelings and emotions that I would never dream about telling to a real person and I think I really need some advice. I'm sorry if I don't seem worthy of being on this sub or if I come off as pretentious but I still feel like nothing and I'm starting to doubt if that will ever change.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I feel like I walk on eggshells constantly around him. If I talk to him too much, not enough, or ask him a question he will go from 0-100 in a second. This includes asking him how his day was, where something is, or telling him some things about me and the kids day. He is now like this with all 4 children as well and will yell whenever they ask a question to him as well. We are all scared to even talk to him anymore. \n\nHe works full time and I work part time and do the majority of the house work and almost all of the raising of his and my kids. There are 4 kids and one with HFASD and SPD so its a lot day to day.  If I am ever overwhelmed or out of time and need help with a task he will yell and get extremely angry for asking him for help since he says he works more and doesn\u2019t have time or energy for the kids or the house. But if housework isn\u2019t done up to his standard or when he wants it done he makes it known to me that I need to step it up. (I have a chronic bile reflux issue from a botched gallbladder removal surgery so when it acts up I am extremely limited. )\n\nHe refuses to participate in most family activities, movie nights, taking them places like the park, playing outside with them or being emotionally there for any of them. (His two were abused by their mother and have on going issues because of it).  He states he is too tired or doesn\u2019t like those things so won\u2019t participate. We shrug and do them anyways without him. \n\nHe refused to participate in a Birthday party at our house for one of the kids bc it was too hot and he was tired. He slept through half of it and refused to help set up or clean up. I had to drag him out to sing happy birthday and asked him to spend some time with her to celebrate as a family all together which resulted in him screaming at me for nagging too much and throwing his food down on the kitchen floor and stomping off. In the middle of the party. \n\nIf I do not answer my phone the first time he will call over and over and text until I respond. Even if I let him know I am busy and will call back ASAP he will get angry and refuse to talk to me the rest of the day.  I am either at home or work and that\u2019s it. He knows that I get busy with the kids but he says I should drop what I am doing to talk to him when he wants to (lunch breaks at work) even if there\u2019s a sick or hurt kid or I am making them food. \n\nWhen he wants to go out somewhere, he will just walk out the door and leave all of us behind if we aren\u2019t ready to go the second he is. That includes if we aren\u2019t even given a heads up to get ready to go. (4 kids takes a few mins to get out of the house with no help).  For example, he wanted to go on a motorcycle ride after he came back from the store. I hadn\u2019t eaten that entire day so I told him I would shower and eat and be ready. I worked all day so needed to. I was only given a few minute warning about this so he said if I wasn\u2019t out of the shower and ready as soon as he got home (15 mins) he was leaving me home.  He also wanted to have some intimate time before going to bed. I told him sure just let me call my daughter to say goodnight since she was at her dads and crying for me. He didn\u2019t like that answer bc he wanted all of the night to be for him and not my child. He makes me choose between the kids and him and contantly puts me down for how I parent. I have stepped up and became a mom for his two kids bc I love them so much but I never get any appreciation just talked down to for spending so much time with them. \n\nWhen he gets angry at me he resorts to name calling and cussing even in front of the kids. He will follow me around the house until I talk even if I ask to cool off first and talk later away from the kids. Yesterday he turned off the whole house power, smoked inside the house with the kids there, and stole my medication bc I refused to talk at 330am when the kids were sleeping. He was screaming, name calling, broke up with me( we\u2019re engaged) , and left the house threatening to hook up with someone. I didn\u2019t engage him since I knew it was the rage talking.  I was trying to use the bathroom during this encounter and bc I locked the door he broke it down to get in there with me. \n\nHe constantly calls my autistic 5 year old son names and makes fun of him and yells at him for things out of his control. Then when I ask him to please stop and that it upsets me to hear that as well he turns angry and starts a fight bc I am upset. I am not allowed to discuss how I am feeling. He either gets mad, says I feel those things bc of how I treat him and blames me for how he talks to me and treats me.  If I didn\u2019t ask him things, discuss my feelings, or speak up for the kids sake he wouldn\u2019t have to scream at me. \n\nWhen angry he withholds money, my medications, sex, electricity, etc from me until he gets what he wants out of me. On vacation he threatened to call the cops bc I was at the air bnb he used his money to reserve, and took the car rental keys away from me even though my name was on it but he paid. He then refused to give me money to feed the kids and refused to leave the house and enjoy the vacation with us. This was my family\u2019s first time meeting him. \n\nWhen angry he is allowed to take time to cool off like lay down in the bedroom or go out with his friends. I am not allowed to though and if I try and leave he physically tries to stop me or breaks down the door of the room. \n\nI am not allowed to watch tv in our bedroom after a certain time, wake him up for any reason including for plans the next day, turn down the fans in our room, sleep in too many clothes, or use his money for anything for the house or kids.  If the kids need me too much and he doesn\u2019t get enough time with me I am punished by him not speaking to me for days. He will even block my phone number while at work. He refuses to spend money on things like braces for his kids but will drop money at the bar multiple times a week. I am not allowed to go out without him, go on a walk anywhere alone, work in certain places, etc but he goes out weekly with friends to bars. \n\nBut all of this behavior is because I am not a good enough girlfriend. I nag too much.  Ask him for help too much and spend too much time being a mother. If I didn\u2019t do these things he says he wouldn\u2019t have to yell at me and treat me this way.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

By the time my seventh .month of pregnancy came around my obgyn was extremely concerned as it had been over a month and I hadn't even gained a solid pound..I was so disappointed in myself for taking him back and giving him this much control over me and the developing baby. So I called him out to his dad and let him have a copy of the message so there was no more miscommunication. Not that he hasn't lied saying I'm crazy or whatever to everyone he has surrounded himself with.

But what bothers me is that I thought it would be clear for him to stay ignoring me again after calling him out to his father and my family. So what's his intentions? I will NOT give him any response. No attention is worse than negative attention. Could it just be to say he tried everything and get a poor him response from others? If that's the case, ok great I dont care... I was always trying to get him to be honest about the other women on the side... I had proof of more than two but he is so delusional what he says is true.

Do I set boundaries for NC via text back?", "author": "skogurt", "self_text": "Hi, first time posting. \n\nThis might get kinda long because writing is hard for me. (TL;DR at the end for ya)\n\nMy (soon to be ex) friend/roommate is in the process of moving out of our (there's 6 of us) house. Pretty much since she moved in, she hasn't hung out at the house very much despite being super excited to move in together last September (made lots of plans for \"family\" dinners and etc). She's progressively spent less and less time at the house, saying she doesn't feel at home. At first, I empathized because there were a few roommates we didn't know very well, and I was feeling it a bit too. It was only after she started coming home once or twice a week (almost never sleeping here) that I started to have a little less empathy and started to realize that the friend I've admired and been so close to might have narcissistic behaviors. \n\nI wanna list some of the things that have happened that I've been questioning over and over again and feeling crazy about: \n\n* After probably a month or two of us moving in, she started to get increasingly frustrated by some of our roommates not doing their share of housework. She would attribute this to their laziness, incompetence, forgetfulness. I did my share consistently. She praised me a lot for being tidy, helping out around the house, \"having my shit together\", etc. Eventually I started feeling frustrated by our roommates not helping too. We ruminated on that a lot and I started to feel resentful of them for not helping. I did not occur to me while Nfriend was around to *talk* to them and ask questions. (I did this recently and have gotten super close with my roommates since. And the dishes get done way more!)\n* (I wasn't there for this one, but my bf told me about it later). Nfriend got into a loud verbal argument with two of our roommates after sending a picture of the dirty dishes to our house group chat with a message talking about the \"blatant lack of accountability\" and how everyone \"owe\\[s\\] it to the house to speak up\". She called for a house meeting and assured us she wasn't \"being domineering or bitchy, just disappointed.\"\n* She paid rent 10 days late this month. We found out via an eviction notice that we were to pay the remaining rent plus the late fee within 3 days or leave. Nfriend wasn't there when we received it and her phone was lost so we couldn't contact her that night. We all go to bed super anxious and upset. Next day, Nfriend replies to my fb message that had pictures of the notice, saying she'd already told our property management company that she was going to pay it late, that she'd call again, she's sorry, and she'll sort it out. Sometime the next day she must've come home briefly and left a note on the fridge that said she sorted it out and sorry about that. About a week ago, she brought up the ordeal to remind me it wasn't her fault. \n* She has two cats (one is almost 2 years old, the other one is 15+).  Since she hasn't been home very often, the cats' litter boxes were filling up. I started cleaning them every couple days and sent Nfriend a fb message saying we'd noticed their litter boxes were really full for a long time and that I was really really okay with helping out for some compensation and that I'd prefer to talk about it in person later on. I honestly didn't mind because I love those kitties and they ended up getting really attached to me. She replied by telling me not to worry about it and went on to send me her work/life schedule and tell me about all the health and social problems that prevented her from feeding and cleaning up after her cats. She came home a couple days later and put $5 on the fridge with note that said \"cats\" for me. This and the rent thing happened this month. \n* She took her 2 year old cat to her new house about a week ago. She didn't tell us when she was going to take the cat and just shouted from across the house that she was going to leave with kitty. My bf rushed out and asked if I could say good bye and as I was having my moment, she came into my room and saw that I was crying and said, \"It's not traumatic, damn. I'm not like dead or anything.\" \n\nBeyond these events, it seems like one day she just randomly decided to stop showering me in the same affection she used to and started to be annoyed with me. I feel uneasy around her. She interprets a lot of what I say or my body language as a personal attack on her, even when I've deliberately had a neutral demeanor to try to avoid just that. She will often act offended (rolling her eyes, leaving the room abruptly) but verbally reassure me she isn't offended when I apologize for accidentally offending her. She told me our friendship has this dynamic because I'm a poor communicator. She seems to have a habit of needing to single people out to confront them about any tiny perceived transgression against her. I can't ever seem to say the right thing and so I think I'm going to try to cut contact with her. I've already been feeling a lot happier and more open since making this decision. \n\nThe only problem now is that she decided to message me this apology today while I was at work:\n\n\"I love you. I'm sorry for being insensitive and immature in the way I've handled things. I appreciate you communicating and have remorse regarding our current stance. I haven't known how to talk at all but I should've tried harder and with more intent. Peace and blessings. See you soon.\"\n\nI've been around and even helped her type messages like that to other people that were trying to create some space in their relationship. I was always really confused about the reasons why they would avoid Nfriend so much. Nfriend also always seemed confused by it.\n\nIdeally for me, I would just cut contact with no explanation for a while until I simmer down some more. I'm debating whether it would be a better idea to try to let her know I need space via messenger rather than wait until I see her in person (I have no idea when that'll be, but her stuff has to be completely out of the house in 4 days). \n\n**TL;DR:** Basically I thought my Nfriend was the most eloquent, personable, sensitive, empathetic, genuine person before we moved in together. Nfriend starts being Nfriend (I think? I don't want to be too sure) and I want to cut contact. We don't talk for a couple days and she sends me an apology via text. I feel really weird about it and don't know if I should try to ask for some space right now or wait until I see her in person.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Me and my mother always argued, and when I was \u201cgetting out of hand\u201d she would hold me down face first on the floor and sit on top of me until I calmed down. This happened multiple times a week. I would often get punished for being angry, sad or just too emotional. Sometimes she would refuse to let me go to friends birthday parties, and she said it was because I didn\u2019t know how to behave and it would be embarrassing to let me out of the house like this. This of course ended up with me getting angry, and her holding me down. \nI was so sure that I had an amazing childhood, but truth is; I was never properly allowed to feel anything else than happiness. When I was sad, I was told I was being dramatic. When I was called dramatic, I threw a tantrum because I felt misunderstood. This again lead to punishment. I can\u2019t really remember my dad being violent, but I was always terrified when he got angry. Maybe it was his body language, or something I\u2019ve repressed, but I was really scared of him. When my mom was out of town, he would punch walls and stomp around when he was mad at me. I hid in my room, and he removed the door to my bedroom so I couldn\u2019t hide. Then my mom came home, I would tell her, and she would always say that I have to learn. They act like this to show me how not to act, and it\u2019s because they love me. This made a lot of sense to me, but it never helped. I couldn\u2019t control my emotions, but I got punished for them every time. I got diagnosed with severe clinical depression and anxiety when I was 12, and got into therapy. My mother helped me for a while, but she got enough. She told me that my feelings were a burden, and that she couldn\u2019t breathe when I was around. She couldn\u2019t stand to even look at me. I never talked about my parents in therapy, and didn\u2019t really understand what the therapist could help me with. I never opened up to her, so I never got the help I needed. I think I threw tantrums on purpose sometimes, when I was really sad. I felt like I deserved what I got, and I hated myself. My low self-esteem got even lower, and I barely ate. I was naturally skinny, because I was a 5\u201911 thirteen year old girl, but I felt fat. I told my mom, who said it wouldn\u2019t hurt to lose a few kilos. So I lost 15. I was severely underweight, but my mom praised me for the self control I showed with food. I\u2019m 20 now and she still makes comments about the time I was thirteen, skinny and beautiful. I eat normally now, but I haven\u2019t felt comfortable in my own skin since I was 11. \nI know this isn\u2019t a very dramatic story, I know people have it a lot worse. But at the same time, I\u2019m sure parents aren\u2019t supposed to hold their child down to the floor while the child is screaming their lungs out, crying and telling them to let go. While I\u2019m writing this, I feel so guilty. I still don\u2019t know if I agree with her ways or not. I know I would never discipline a child like that. I\u2019m sorry that this got so long, but if anyone read it all: thank you. I just needed to get it out there. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m admitting to myself that my problems could be partly their fault.\n\nMy question to those of you who read everything: is this emotional abuse, or not? Is this normal?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

She had a karaoke meet up earlier for which I dropped her off. When picking her up she smiled to other her friends then sat in the car and said that she just started feeling a very strong wisdom tooth pain. While sitting in the car she started playing a drama queen and how the pain is so terrible it makes her want to die. When we came home I got out of the car and went straight upstairs without saying a word. She cried \"see, you don't even care if I am in pain!\" I messaged her a few minutes later and told her rinse her mouth with salt and water, chew on some mint and take an ibuprofen if it still hurts too much. Meanwhile I stirred her some salt water and found some ibuprofen. Then it seemed like the drama ended.\n\nLater in the day after 2 hours she continued, \"oh the pain hasn't stopped in 2 hours, it is soooo strong!!! We need to go to ER!!! We need to find a dentist and remove it immediately now!\" I said it's midnight there is no dentist and we don't need ER. Then I said I had wisdom tooth pain before, it usually lasts for 2 days and then stops. I asked her to take Ibuprofen (which she didn't take earlier), found an ice bag to hold, then drove to the nearest supermarket and bought some ice cubes to chew. All without saying too many words. She still kept crying and searching for doctors and making a dramatic scene. I told her to wait for 30 minutes for ibuprofen to work and then decide and left her in the bedroom. She still cried that it's not helping but I just ignored, and instead started writing this post outside. She seems to have stopped crying and the \"life-threatening\" wisdom tooth pain is not as painful anymore. And I keep ignoring her. She now said she will skip work tomorrow.\n\nIn short, I am dealing with a child. A child's teeth fall out and regrow and nobody goes to ER for that. I had my own two wisdom teeth bother me for one year before I finally removed them, so I know the pain and exactly how much it hurts. I mean almost everyone goes through it and nobody has died yet. So why so much drama? And this happens for every pain - we already went to ER twice before because of \"life-threatening\" pain and each time the doctor said everything is normal and they couldn't find anything. She then complained to me that the doctors in the US are not thorough enough and in her home country they would definitely run more tests. Each time the ER visit cost was slightly under $1k after insurance. She also complains immensely about her period every month and she wants to die every month. For that I sit quietly because with all respect to all the ladies I really don't know how much a period hurts.\n\nMy biggest problem with this is that it's very dangerous to not know the truly threatening pain. I am very worried that one day one of the pains will be real and I will overlook it. Like, can she even try to just reasonably evaluate the level of pain and what will and what won't make her die? I can't take her to ER every time she wants to, I feel embarrassed and inappropriate sitting there watching people come in with heart attacks and pregnancies and shortages of breath, meanwhile with her \"dying\" from wisdom tooth ache, yet I still go and sit and support her. I am seriously concerned that I cannot tell what really is happening.\n\nBtw, it took me 30 minutes to write this post and she is still lying in the bedroom quietly like all the pain is gone browsing through her phone.

She showed me a lot of love, and that's probably why it took me so long to acknowledge she still may have been emotionally abusive to my brother and I.\n\nOur dad died when I was 2, and my brother 4.\nA car accident.\nI still remember the weird hurting feeling of my brother and I secretly witnessing her cry endlessly and our expectation of our father to come back home and support her.\nBut that's the only memory I have from that period.\nMy brother and I, hiding in the stairwell, seeing her lying on the table crying for hours.\n\nThen, I grew up, and in my mind it was not a trauma to me that I had lost my dad, it was a trauma for her because she lost her husband and father of her two very young children.\n\nMy mum did tons of fun activities with us when you where kids, she threw parties, baked a lot, took us to the movies and themed parks and was really good at giving us the childhood any kid ought to have.\n\nBut as long as I can remember, there was always, maybe like one or two times a week, those moments where she had meltdown. She would take a tiny little thing we had done wrong - it was mainly about not cleaning our room or the dishes - and started yelling, crying, collapsing, and telling us how life was already crual to her since her mum did not love her enough (she suffered a lot from that and was not healed when my dad died) and she was a widow living a terribly unfair and painful life and now we were just adding to the pain and we were misloving and mistreating her. She made us guilty for little actions I believe any children do, since, you know, we were children, looking for boundaries. We were never mean or even particularly messy, we were just children.\n\nI remember those moments and the silent it made me fall into. I believe I started internalize a lot of my negative emotions ever since.\nShe would even let notes with many, many reproaches every where in our apartment and our room. Once I counted them and there were like 50 little post-its with reproaches. Not insult, not humiliation, just her writing us how bad children we were to her because she was already in a lot of pain.\n\nShe shared with us all the pain she was going through. She told us every little details of how people (like EVERYBODY), was mean and unfair to her. She could not stop talking about her co-workers and a lot of her friends got away from her because she wouldn't realize she was talking alone for hours about things no one could understand. She told me how her sister was terrible to her and that made me cry. I was 7 and still remember crying for my mother for hours because she had just told me her sister had let her down to go to a party without her because she was ashamed of her.\n\nHer sister died of cancer 8 years ago and I was very close to her and my mother would send me endless mails out of jealousy because I was spending time with my dying aunt and how she wishes she was sick to death to so that I would care for her the same way.\nShe would even compare herself expecting attention from me to a dog waiting for a sugar. \n\nShe always shares all her feelings and she does not care about mine.\n\nWhen I was 12 I was bullied at school because I was fat and ugly and she let me go back there knowing what was happening.\nI did not have a father to tell me I was beautiful and worth of man love and that period of my teen hood is still an unhealed trauma that impacts my social life painfully.\n\nI started smoking pot at 17 and never stopped smoking weed before going to sleep ever since.\nI had no self esteem and when I lost a lot of weight I slept with like 50 guys in 3 or 4 years. They were coming at my place and my mum did not care. \nI was feeling deeply depressed like forever but did not know it was not how life was supposed to be, since no one taught me that. \n\nThere was also a boundaries and intimacy issues with her, she red my secret diaries and even once used it to shame me because I was talking about masturbation in it. \n\nI remember having thought \"you are not my mum anymore\" the day she did that. \n\nSo, little by little, I walked away from her. And she had kept guilting me for it. And never even asked me if there was something SHE HAD DONE that would explain that.

I\u2019ve been with my guy for almost 4 years now. Our relationship has not been the best. Lots of ups and downs, but I love him very much. I noticed certain things early on, but I ignored them because at the time, I was so desperate for romantic love and he came along and he was perfect in every way. I wish I knew what I know now, though. \n\nOur relationship has been a lot of fighting. Mainly over how he has treats me, and speaks to me on many occasions. He was nasty and would tell me how I was \u201cthe devil\u201d and how I am this angry ball of hate and needed help. At first, I was like \u201cI am not like that, stop\u201d but eventually, he had me believing him. I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but he would get a reaction out of me and then use said reaction to prove his point. It worked like a charm. I started to go to weekly counseling sessions to get a \u201ccontrol\u201d on my anger. I did that for a year every week. I was convinced something was wrong with me, until my counselor straight out told me there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with me. I had some past trauma that she helped me work through, but for the anger part, she said I didn\u2019t seem angry. I seemed a bit hurt over what has been done to me in the past, but she thought I seemed pretty adjusted in life. After a year, we decided it was time to stop sessions. Needless to say, he did not like that. He said that she probably \u201cgot her degree at some 2nd rate community college and didn\u2019t know what she was talking about.\u201d I felt so defeated. It\u2019s like, you pushed me to do this and now it isn\u2019t satisfying enough. Idk. \n\nJump to 2 more years of daily phone calls to tell me I ruined his life. He tells me I\u2019m asexual because we\u2019ve stop sleeping together because I have no energy and I\u2019m not attracted to him as much anymore because everything I do, it\u2019s never good enough. He always finds something wrong with me and I actually believed every word. I started to hate myself in every way. I saw myself as this angry person, with lots of hate in my heart. I would feel guilty af to lash back at him and defend myself because I would too say mean things TO HIM. sometimes, I\u2019d bring myself to try to end the relationship and a week later, I\u2019m crying because I feel like I\u2019m being this horrible person and he\u2019s right and then I beg him to take me back and I love him and blah blah blah. He\u2019ll take me back, but then try\u2019s to make me realize I was the cause of this failure of a relationship. He told me I brought tons of stress on him and I ruin everything. He would tell me my friends and family hate me because I\u2019m this hateful person. He tells me that I\u2019m so mean to my family and that\u2019s why they hate me. I only really have two close friends. He would tell me they were \u201cbitches\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d and he hated them so much. I\u2019d then try to explain that it\u2019s because they see me cry over you a lot and have heard you over the phone and don\u2019t like the way you treat me. Anything he does for me, he holds over my head. But he really doesn\u2019t do much. I bring it up and he goes off the handle saying \u201coh ok, make me out to be the bad guy\u201d and then turns around on me and at the end, I\u2019m feeling like I did something wrong and hate myself. It\u2019s a never ending cycle. \n\nI learned about NPD and narcissistic abuse about a year ago. It started to make a lot of sense. At first, I didn\u2019t want to believe someone who loved me and wanted the best for me would purposely want to hurt me like that. I always knew about manipulative people, but this was very specific. I didn\u2019t want to accept that the man I loved did this to me. But it made so much more sense. It actually made me more aware and I started to pay attention. I would noticed certain things and it was shocking at first. I started to call him out on it. Ooooh, that\u2019s caused ww3 now. He didn\u2019t like that at all. At first he acted like I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about. You see, he is a doctor, and he knows all about that. In the past he would put down my education, but now it seems like he uses that even more now. He made me feel stupid for even suggestions something \u201cyou have no clue about\u201d. I dropped it for a while after that. I didn\u2019t want to come off like I was just talking out of my ass, but I still noticed shit. Over and over and didn\u2019t like it. I started to help me stand up to him, but the more I did, the worse it got. He would threaten to call the cops on me for domestic abuse. He would tell me he didn\u2019t love me anymore and I was ugly. When I would say \u201cstop, you are gaslighting me,\u201d he would fly off the handle and tell me it was I who was the narcissist. Eventually, I believed it because I started lashing out in anger. I started being more mean and cold towards him. I would say mean and nasty things to him and sometimes it felt good. It was relieving to me at times. Then I would feel guilty and cry and beg him to forgive me. He\u2019s made me feel like perhaps I\u2019m the narcissist and I\u2019m projecting. Idk what to believe anymore. I only started to treat him the way he treated me. There are things he has said to me that cut like a knife, but I wouldn\u2019t dare say to him because I know it\u2019s horrible to talk to anyone let alone your significant other like that. But lately, I\u2019ve been cold and mean. I\u2019ve been saying things that I know I shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve been ignoring him, talking to him like he doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. He has me believing I\u2019m the narcissist, because I see all the signs in me. Part of me feels it\u2019s because it\u2019s common for abuse victims to take on what they been though. I feel as if I\u2019m the one discarding him now, and I feel horrible. I don\u2019t want to be that person. I don\u2019t want to be a narcissist. I don\u2019t want to be someone who hurts others. I don\u2019t want to be the victim. I\u2019m asking you guys if you feel I am the narcissist. I need therapy regardless, but if I am a narcissist, I want to get the specific help I need because I don\u2019t want to hurt people and maybe I\u2019d be able to save the relationship, because I love him and I want us to go back to how we used to be. If it was I who was the narc, then I want to get the help i need. Please help.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

During our time together, I didn't understand that what he was doing was abusive, but the more distance I create emotionally, the more I see it. Only in the last week was I able to understand he is a narc. (Sidenote: patting myself on the back for that growth!)\n\nHe still tries to contact me once in a blue moon, every time asking for things. He has it set up so that he gets to control our contact to this day (eg. His GST cheques are still deposited into my bank account, student loan paperwork gets mailed to my apartment) and knows I am too soft to just refuse to help him out. A few days ago, he contacted me about a piece of furniture he left in my apartment when he moved out. Of course, I agreed to let him take it. Of course, he asked for more things from my house after that. \n\nBy this point, I knew that if I let him take these things too, I would never see the end of the list, never be free from him trying to cone to my house. I told him it had all been donated when he left (which is only partially untrue. Why would I keep all of these large items I couldn't use?). He got angry with me and said I should have told him I was doing this, even though when he left, I told him to take everything he wanted and let him come back twice more for more things. \n\nThis got me in fight or flight mode and very defensive. I decided not to play this game any longer, said he couldn't have anything, including the original item we had preciously agreed on. Blocked his number and tried to move on with my life.\n\nYesterday, I get a call from my roommate. My nex had contacted him as well, trying to get my roommate to call him. By this point, I hadn't told him or anyone else for that matter about the interaction we had had. I came home from work to fill my roommate in, to find a letter in my mailbox from my nex calling me a liar. This means he was at my home and looking into my windows while I wasn't there. \n\nI am not scared of him. I don't think at all that my safety is on the line, but that is still really unsettling. I feel like I am being watched now. I put up some heavy curtains on all of my windows and covered the small peep hole in my front door to keep him from watching me. \n\nI messaged a friend of mine after this to get it out of my system and get some perspective. My nex was also contacting her, as they had known each other a long time and outside of our relationship. (Shoutout to this girl, she was showing me bits and pieces of the convo and she had my back in ways I never experienced my entire life). I found out from my roommate, a third friend of mine had heard from him also. He is trying to involve people around me and get people talking to me so I can't just walk away and not think about him anymore.\n\nI am strongly considering calling the police, even if it is just to have it in record that he is acting like this in case something does happen again in the future. The last thing I want to do is create more drama or play into his game. Honestly, I just want it all to be over. How am I supposed to handle this? I am already looking for a new place to live so he won't be able to walk up to my front door, but in some ways that doesn't feel like enough.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She got super quiet and didn\u2019t say a word. I was like oh, here we go. The double standard thing again, that\u2019s a new one. I knew what was coming. \n\nShe wanted to leave the concert so we did and she absolutely lost her mind when we got outside, screaming at me at the top of her lungs in the parking lot for saying another girl was good looking. I\u2019m not kidding, this was a full blown meltdown. \n\nWe got back to the hotel and it only got worse. I was pissed and screaming back now because I did that a lot and as you can imagine, it doesn\u2019t go over well. I ended up telling her she was a \u201cfucking psycho\u201d.

It's awful, but not for me.", "author": "ThrowAwayHere6", "self_text": "Today is our two year anniversary... today... Yesterday, she went on a date with some dude that cut our grass once. Her facebook profile already is listed under \"single,\" and she is already seeing new people, a week after the shit hit the fan and we agreed on divorce. We were going to wait until we got the house sold to start filing papers, but after seeing how much she tried for this dude, I realize how fucked I actually am every second that I stay married to this chick. Its toxic. Healthy people don't do that, and it confirms a lot of suspicions. \n\nI am responsible for literally everything happening in my life. I'm not at fault for some of it, but I am responsible for dealing with it. Seeing how much effort she put into the four hour hook up with this guy (which was \"totally not a date\" according to her. Dear, you have an make up on inches thick, hoops, and your boobs are yanked up to your chin.) Kind of wished she would have put even a piece of that effort into actually helping foster a healthy marriage, but I did have a realization yesterday while reading \"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck.\" I thought I would share.\n\nIt was never about me. \n\nThe days preceding the request for a divorce were rough. My therapist and I are really digging in and working on some internal stuff. I'm bettering myself. I am learning to enjoy my own company. I am learning to not base my own self worth on what other people think or how much attention I get. I'm not special, and neither are you. Everyone has problems, and yes, some are more cumbersome than others. We are all responsible how we deal with those problems though.\n\nMy STBX wife is dealing with it by chain smoking, hooking up, kissing girls, going on dates, and getting shit faced regularly. It's hard to accept, but the truth is, that's not really all that much different from how the marriage was before. I was just another means of validation for her world view. She hates herself, and needs constant attention to hide the pain of being called ugly as a child and being pressured too much by her parents to be exceptional. And now I see things a lot more clearly than before. I'm not right; I'm just less wrong. It actually makes a ton of sense why she would act this way. \n\nI was constantly thinking, \"How is it so easy for her to just pick up and start fucking around? Maybe I am the one who has the problem. Maybe I am the one who is hanging on to something that is trying to leave me in the dust.\" The problem was my perspective. Do you see how many I's are in there? I was treating this like I was the center of this story. Essentially I was playing into a victim mentally, when in reality, I have chosen to be in this situation one way or another. \n\nI kept wondering how someone can mean so much to her that she is willing to leave me behind, but again, I was focusing on me too much, which is a tricky balance when you are learning to accept yourself for who you are. Its easy to get blinders. If you take a step back you realize this: I didn't mean all that much to her, and I am being replaced by someone else who doesn't mean to much for her. The minute she realized I wasn't going to put up with either masking her self loathing for her with constant attention or confirming her view that she is awful, she leaves. If she can't grow and change. If she can't realize her own worth and put her ego aside, if she can't stop being the victim of every bad thing she perceives, if she can't stop trying to mask her pain with pleasure instead of healing it with happiness, she is going to stay just as miserable and self hating and shallow. In fact, she will probably get worse. I don't blame her for that, but I am not responsible or at fault for her choosing those things, no matter how awful it gets for her. I blame her for a lot, but I also am responsible for realizing that I made my own mistakes. I fucked up a lot. I said things wrong. I did things wrong. I compromised when I should have stood my ground and vice versa. \n\nThe fact is, I did my best, and even though up until now I felt the overwhelming fear that she is going to destroy her life if she doesn't change her perspective on shit, I don't give a fuck. I can't/dont want to control people. I'm not responsible for them. Fuck that. I'm responsible for me and responsible for finding my own happiness. And if I lose everything at the hands of a woman that I thought really had my best interests in mind, I am responsible for figuring out how to weave happiness out of thin air. That's on me, and I can/will do it. I will, and I'm going to fuck it up along the way. It's going to hurt, and I'm sure there are going to be many more sleepless nights to come, nights filled with tears and confusion as I learn to set healthier values. But for now, know this:\n\nYou have chosen everything in your life up until now in one way or another, and if you are in dire straights, you have the power to chose something else, something better, something brighter.

This is something to note. He has some valid points regarding her, but I believe his methods of \"teaching\" is rather harsh.\n\nLet me back up a bit. Last year was the start of my college career, and I went to school hours away from home. I hated it. The school was depressing, my class was composed of partiers, I was losing weight, and generally missed being home. There's a college within driving distance from my school that I am transferring to and has the program I want, but my father isn't too happy about this. Why? Because my friend lives in town currently. He feels I'm going to be constantly distracted and end up failing out because of her. I know that isn't the case and she knows that isn't the case either, but I have no way of proving anything to him until the semester starts in late August. \n\nIn the past, I made a lot of dumb mistakes, specifically in high school. I would always go out with friends and neglect other responsibilities, I skipped out on a college visit to prom-pose to a friend at a zoo, etc. Basically, I did stuff I wasn't supposed to do. I understand that now. I see why my father wouldn't be happy with this. But he still believes I'm completely incapable of change. Here are some instances of my relationship with my father: \n\n* He believes I'm a compulsive liar \n\nI've lied to my father before. Who hasn't lied to their parents before? Everyone has, and if you say you haven't, you are lying. But I didn't lie to him out of disrespect or to cover some nefarious scheme of mine like he believes. I'd lie because the man has a very scary, very intimidating temper. So maybe it was out of selfishness to save my own ass, but if something slightly upsets this guy, he explodes. He's never physical with his anger, but in blind rage, he will berate you, curse you out, and make you feel like a worthless person. That's why I've felt no other option was available aside from lying in the past, because I'd rather lie to him than to deal with the explosive aftermath. \n\nTo him, I'm a pussy for lying and he has no problem letting me know that. \"You're too much of a bitch, a fucking pussy to face me and to face the truth!\" \n\n* He believes I have no ambition in life, and only wish to take the easy way out\n\nMy major is screenwriting. As ambitious/pipe-dreamy of a career as that seems, I want to write for television or movies in the future. Nothing is going to stop me. I don't care how hard it is, I will work just as hard to make this dream a reality. But my dad thinks I picked this major because the classes are easy, and he constantly tells me \"you're going to get nowhere with that degree, you might as well hang it up at the McDonald's you'll be working at\". I'm glad that my father says this on the occasion because it does keep me grounded in reality, but then there's times where I hear \"you are a terrible writer. You'll amount to nothing in the writing world. All the professors telling you that you're great are sugarcoating you to get more money out of you. Your writing is awful.\" \n\n* He believes I'm a failure\n\n\"You're transferring to some bullshit liberal arts school where you're gonna drop out the first semester, you bum! I guarantee it!\" \n\n* He makes up stories about me and believes them to be true\n\nMy dad will say things like \"he is only doing 'x' because of 'y'\" and stuff like that isn't true! And when I tell him it's not true and that he is believing something false about me, he'll say \"of course it's true! Stop lying to me!\" I hate when people assume things about you that aren't true and never let up about it. \n\nAll of these things have made me feel worthless, and I've been depressed for a while because of it. He's brought me down to my core and I feel I've lost a lot of self-confidence I've struggled so hard to achieve. If I cry, I'm only trying to gain sympathy from others. I'm only victimizing myself and that everything is on me and not him. If I'm not able to listen to him screaming and cursing at me face-to-face, I'm not a man and I'm just a pussy. \n\nThe reason I'm asking if this is emotional abuse is because I was under the impression that family is supposed to be a loving support system. Even if parents don't necessarily agree with their child's life choices, they accept, support, and encourage them regardless. But all of this shit my father is throwing at me is making me only want to retreat into my shell more and not face the real world because it's getting to the point where I'm hearing all of this so much that I may be believing it myself. And doing that will only perpetuate the problem further. So I don't know what the hell to do, how to deal with this situation. Am I being abused?!

{"post_id": "cjdtm6", "created_utc": 1564418774, "title": "Is this really emotional abuse?", "author": "secretagentsilence", "self_text": "So a bit of backstory, before I begin.\nI love my mom. I really do. I\u2019m 16 years old, and since I was very young, we\u2019ve had a very turbulent relationship still. I clearly remember one episode, where I must\u2019ve been around 6-8 years old and I accidentally broke something. My mom blew up, told me that it was my fault she didnt know how to control herself, that she felt like beating me, and lastly she told me she wanted me to move out the house. Another time I was drawing and went outside the paper and it got on the floor. She went and grabbed my backpack and told me to pack it, because i was no longer welcome in the house. I must\u2019ve been around 8 years old too, when that happened. The threat of wanting to smack me and kick me out the house continued as I grew up. I really took this to heart, and it really scarred me to be honest.. A year ago, she wanted to kick me out the house for falling asleep during the day and instead staying up later at night. Since I love my mom, and even though all of this is quite messy, she\u2019s a very good listener and gives great advice so I would always talk to her if i felt down.  So I figured that communication would solve this whole thing, and I told her that I was really hurt by what she had said, and it made me feel unwanted and I told her that if she really wanted to send me away to some orphanage (like she said she would,) I would like her to just do it instead. Obviously she said she didnt want to, and that she was very sorry and she would stop immediately. For a brief moment I was very relieved and our relationship seemed to be healing.\n\nBut she did it again. This time I had spent so many nights awake thinking of it, i finally worked up the courage to tell her, that i would move out as soon as i could. This made her absolutely furious, but we eventually talked it out and came to the same conclusion as we did last time. Since then she\u2019s never said it.\n\n\nSo, to the story:\nFast forward, like 9 months, my parents get divorced. This REALLY hit me in a way i thought it wouldnt. I simply just didnt think it would ever happen to me. My mon told me at first, and told me not to say anything to my dad. This had me furious, cause it was disrespectful to my dad, but it also meant that i couldnt tell him the actual reason why i was crying, therefore meaning i wasnt able to be sad in my own home. But they both sat me and my sister (8F) down and we talked it out. Also telling me that my mom has already managed to find a new boyfriend who is way older than her.\n\nMy mom recently asked if i wanted to meet her new BF because my littlesister had asked to meet him. I told her i wasnt ready at all. I can tell she got upset, and started questioning me why i wasnt ready. I told her i just wasn\u2019t interested in meeting him anytime soon. \nNow, i asked my mom if she could drop something off on her way home from work cause i was staying at my boyfriends house. I\u2019ve been staying over a lot lately cause i hate being home, but so has my mom. So agreed. When she came, she called and asked \u201cCan both of us come?\u201d meaning that she DID bring her boyfriend. This was like 4 days after me telling her i wasnt ready. I freaked out completely and I really did feel obligated to say yes, cause I didnt want to upset her and eventually making her mad by saying no. So they both came. Her new BF didnt even look at me. Didnt speak to me, never even greeted me. He went straight to talking to my boyfriend. I told my mom i thought that was really weird. But to be fair, it wasnt terrible meeting him but I certainly didnt enjoy it.\n\nTwo days later, i needed a ride to go to see my boyfriend perform sports. I asked my mom, and she told me \u201cSure, [new boyfriend] can take us\u201d \ni was hesitant to say yes, because it was a 45 min drive, and i didnt want to be forced to talking to him, but i figured that if my mom was there i wouldnt have to, and i really wanted to see my boyfriend perform. When the fay comes, i see him pull up with my mom and she walks out of the car. I ask my dad if she isn\u2019t going, and he says \u201chmm, i don\u2019t know.\u201d So thinking that she is going too, i just walk down to new BF\u2019s car and ask my mom why she\u2019s going. She told me that  she wasnt going and i responded with \u201cyou didn\u2019t say that.\u201d And she then just said \u201ci did tell you!\u201d i kept saying that she definitely hadn\u2019t told me (because if she did, i would\u2019ve never agreed)\nThis was all in front of her new bf. \nI eventually started crying and i said \u201cCool, then im not going, because this isnt what you told me.\u201d She got furious and told me this wasnt okay, and i was acting up and being naughty. Heres the dialogue i stuck most to\n\nME: I told you i wasnt ready to do this, and this isnt okay\n\nHER: You were fine with meeting him the other day? I cant figure out what you want me to do\n\nME: i wasn\u2019t really able to say no, and I did tell you i wasnt ready, please let me go to my room\n\nHER: You were fully able to say no, and if you had, then I would\u2019ve not have brought him\n\nME: Our past experiences really doesnt suggest that you would\u2019ve been okay with that\n\nHER: Well, ask your dad where he was last thursday!\n\nME: I really don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t care about anything both of you do\n\nHER, to my dad: Well then, where were you?!\n\nDAD: I went on a date, with another woman.\n\nME, to my mom: What will you gain from that? What do you get out of him saying that? Do you want to shine a bad light on him? \n\nAnd i don\u2019t exactly remember her response.\n\nWe were both screaming at this point, and my blood was boiling. I was furious.\n\nShe takes of her glasses and says; I can tell you want to hit me, so do it! Cause im such a bad mom, and I know you hate me. After me saying that i don\u2019t want to hit her she tries to hug me. And i back the fuck away, cause i really wasnt having that.\nI don\u2019t exactly remember how, cause some of it is blurry to me but i somehow end up saying that all these threats she\u2019s been making taught me to never put a hand on anyone, and i told her how scary it was for me when she would say it. She asks me if it\u2019s her new BF\u2019s fault, that im angry, and i told her it\u2019s noone but her fault. She asked me if i wanted her to move out, or more specifically if i was excited about her moving out and I told her that I was the one who wanted to move out. Keep in mind, that this whole time my dad is standing silently and backing my mom up whenever she tells him to. \n\nMy mom and I both calm down and i tell her that i need space. And that i need a lot of it. I tell her all the things i\u2019ve thought while laying awake at night. I tell her that I want to move out. After her wanting to kick me out for ao long, i finally give her \u2018the pleasure\u2019 of me wanting to do it on my own. I told her that i didnt want a relationship with her, but after talking about it we agreed to try not talking for a week, and see if it wouls help.\n\nI know i need to see a therapist, cause i cant handle this on my own. For months ive layed awake at night wondering what my future is gonna be, feeling neglected and unwanted. I just really wish that i could fast forward to the day im old enough to move out and get a place on my own. I\u2019m not sure i\u2019d want to me in contact with my parents once i do that. \n\nThank you for reading.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Something about the way he was acting I must've intuitively known wasn't normal and it drove me to try to figure it out. I might've heard it somewhere, who knows. When the gut-wrenchingly cold and heartless discard came, I spent most of my free time researching it more and boom! He hit every single point on the scale. I happened upon this sub once he discarded me and it's been a life-saver.  I can't imagine how I'd feel about myself had I been discarded without your support and hearing your eerily similar stories. \n\nThese are some of the things I would've actually believed had I not been able to logically talk myself out of believing his lies:\n\n* I once asked if he treated his ex the horrible way he'd scream at me. He said, \"No way. She was a princess. I had to be perfect for her all the time and I was.\" Bullshit. I reached out to her finally when he discarded me and she told me the only reason she responded (she wanted to have NOTHING to do with anything about him) was because of how much she understood what I was going through and truly felt for me. Yeah, this dude was perfect to her? It was all her? Uh-huh. He knew I was jealous of their prior relationship, because he triangulated her with me, and implying that I deserved this treatment because I wasn't worth better. Fuck you, dude. I know it was lies now. Thank God. \n* He told me that I was responsible for the break up for the things I said...after he broke up with me. If I hadn't been reading this sub, I would've been thinking I really was nuts. He would've had me deeply regretting everything I ever did and questioning my own recent reality to figure out how I'd screwed everything up. I caught the gaslight as he said it and only felt the futility of trying to ever talk to him again; and to let the crazy bastard go if he'll try that kind of shit. I was only reaffirmed of his crazy and not of mine. \n* Reading my journal and all the horrible things he did and said to me, without this sub, I would've been taking my thousands of apologies for his bad behavior as weakness and failings. He sure did. But instead, I see it as being manipulated into feeling bad for being a nice person who actually cared for him. His fault, not mine. I'm glad that I can be proud of being a nice person; and not become jaded and hateful for something he did to me. \n* His discard was so brutal and set on trying to convince me that I was nothing to him, we were never a couple, I only rented a room from him, and the whole relationship was made up in MY head. It has been throbbing in my heart ever since. The stories here remind me that, of course, they're going to say that. It may be true overall but I'm reminded here that they are great actors and it's not my fault for not seeing it sooner, not my fault for believing him the hundreds of times he vowed his undying love for me, the \"first time he'd ever knew what love was.\" I'm not going to beat myself up for not seeing through that shit. Without support, I'd feel like the biggest fool and question my own ability to navigate through any future relationship if I was that blind. Again, him. Not me. Thank God.\n\nThis is an awesome space and thank you for all of your stories, though I'm sorry you've had to feel this, too. I don't feel so alone like I would've.

However, he dropped his act a few weeks later and began calling me stupid, attention-seeker, prude and naive.\n\nWhen I told him my problems again (like me parents indirectly calling me a whore) he said that I was exagerating/being too dramatic and acting like a superstar.\n\n\u2022He only met me when it was convenient for him. Wouldn't send me home no matter how late it was. In fact, there was a point of time where the train services have already ceased. I couldn't take the train home, so I had to take the taxi home. And though I took the taxi home, I had a balance of one dollar, the cab driver was angry at me, but let it go because he had no choice.\n\n\u2022 He told me that I was so poor that I couldn't even pay for a cab late at night. He told me to get a full time job so I can give him a new phone.\n\n\u2022 Always made me buy coffee for him from starbucks (With my own money).

My own parents were verbally and emotionally abusive. So I had nowhere to run to but him because he was so kind to me ( at the beginning). I thought I did something wrong and it was my fault when his personality took a 180\u00b0 degree turn.

I realized why I never held anger towards the fact that I was excluded at school and yelled at by my classmates and why my friends turned their backs on me, if I am inherently shameful, isn\u2019t that a natural consequence? People say \u201cyou are okay\u201d \u201cyou are good enough\u201d well what if that\u2019s a fucking lie? If someone is inherently shameful and cringey they shouldn\u2019t delude themselves or else they will get backhanded by the reality of who they are like I was. That is why I am not even mad at them if not them shaming me it would\u2019ve been another\u2019s group of people to do it. Which is why even today when I try to be myself I get similar reactions to when I was last authentic in elementary, even people who say they accept me act weird when I\u2019m authentic. I can\u2019t be mad at who I am it is just who I am, but I can\u2019t lie to myself and say \u201cI\u2019m okay\u201d only to be shamed again.\n\nI tried to take on the belief that \u201cmaybe they were wrong and I\u2019m not cringey, shameful, deserving of ostracism and hatred\u201d but if that\u2019s true then why did bystanders allow the \u201cbullying\u201d , why did the teacher allow it and like the \u201cbullies\u201d more than me? Why did \u201cbullies\u201d who were apparently committing wrong acts daily of making fun of me have friends while I didn\u2019t? Why Were others defended whenever mean behaviour happened in the classroom while I wasn\u2019t? People knew I was being shamed, everyone knew but no one cared, because I must\u2019ve deserved it therefore it wasn\u2019t worthy of attention or I am not worthy of respect right? I couldn\u2019t imagine that everyone in my class including the teacher just had some conspiracy against me that \u201cbullying is inherently wrong unless it happens to Authentic2017\u201d. What I went through must not have been bullying then, wouldn\u2019t you ostracize, pick on and insult someone who was a bad person? They tried to be nice to me sometimes and tell me why others didn\u2019t like me, but I couldn\u2019t keep them from hating me because it wasn\u2019t what I did it was who I WAS. I must\u2019ve done something to deserve it, I must be inherently bad. So ya maybe the actions were bully actions but if I deserved it so what? Cruelty isn\u2019t inherently wrong. Wouldn\u2019t you treat a serial killer or rapist or a robber with cruelty if they deserved it? What about parents who punish their kid? Is the kid justifying in being upset if they deserved the treatment? No, well neither am I. So ya, if people know the real me they will see the same badness that by \u201cbullies\u201d saw and they\u2019ll leave me aswell like my old friends did. I don\u2019t even see my \u201cbullies\u201d and bullies, to me they were people that taught me of my bad attributes that I should\u2019ve known about and hidden prior, because if not them someone else would've shown me.\n\nSo ya the whole, be yourself thing doesn\u2019t make sense to me because if there is proof that the person is flawed why\u2019s would they continue to reveal their personality that got them shamed?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm going to live with my dad soon (mainly because he has better behavior towards me), please dont judge me yet. \n\nJust hear me out:\n\nMy Mother is a nice person but when shes angry she completely changes she got a bit better but not really.\n\n\nWhenever my mother is Angry she really tries so hard to bully me. She calls me names like how im a dirty whore and stuff like that, she says very racist stuff about my paternal side of family. She also wishes that I would just get murdered and tells me I am worthless and deserve to die and such.\n\n(this only happens when shes angry) \nWhenever she used to have problems she always found a way to make it seem like it was all my fault and being just young I believed it. She made me believe my fathers side of the family are terrible people and that their genes are \"trash\" and thats why Im trash. She banned me for seeing them for a few years. She used to just stand there and wish horrible things upon me and used to tell me how I am worthless and I should just take my life. She used to go on and on about how shes gonna make me pay because Im the reason for her problems. She used to scream at me very aggresively and tried to beat me as well but luckily my family members would step in. She was overall very aggresive when angry and really broke my self esteem for a while.\n\nAnother thing she did was  make me stand outside of the hallway of our apartement complex in my sleepwear/pajamas\nshe wouldnt even let me in to use the bathroom. Every hour she would check on me by opening the door a bit and instead of letting me in she just screamed nasty things or just made me cry. And all of this while our neighbours passed by in the hallway. It was very humiliating. She tried kicking me out but I was only 10 at that time and she told me not to tell my teacher because otherwise she would lie to the police and tell them im a criminal and I would get deported.\n\n\nThe only reason why she didnt use physical violence on me as a child was because my dad protected me, but he left.  Like she deadass would get her hand ready run towards me and just before it escelated to more then one hit my dad stepped in and dragged her away.\n\nAs I was younger it was only words when she was angry but as I grew older she became more aggresive. \n\nShe started threatening that she would Murder me, Choke me in my sleep, kick me out or just cut off my hair to humiliate me. She started trying to use physical violence on me. That didnt last long tho.\n\n\nI was a skinny and small 11-13 year old.\n\nAt first it was her hands she would just like smack me in the face or my hands. Twice she hit me with a purse with a big metal logo and metal detaills. Then she Hit me with a cooking spoon out of wood.\n\nSoon she Hit me with the sharp side of a knife threatening to stab me and my dad- luckily stepping in.\n\nShe once held me in an MMA style choke and I barely even escaped she really used force and I injured her hand while escaping so she would let go. It was only a small scratch but she just went off and told me about how disrespectful I am.\n\nThe only reason she doesnt beat me anymore when Angry is because I am taller and stronger than her and I run really fast, fast enough to get into another room and lock the door till I am safe.\n\nbut if she could she would most definetly because she always threatens me till this day.\n\nMy mom Is actually a nice woman despite all of this she has done a lot of nice things but I just couldn't live with her anymore.\n\nI wanted to go live with my dad.\nMy father has never laid. hand on me nor will he ever. The only person he fights and used to fight with is my mom. He was always the nice parent you see in movies but due to his issues with my mom he couldnt live with me for 8 years.\n\nHe has a gambling addiction which is actually always controlled until he sees my mom and has a fight.\n\nWell while he was away I made sure to tell my father everything my mom had ever done to me. He was not happy about it at all. He came back and he was really nice to me but he has been getting into fights with my mom recently.\n\n\nAnd he has choked her once and kicked her once on two different occasions. He also threatened her a few times. \n\n\nI feel bad for my mom but I still am gonna live with my dad because he doesnt abuse me ( I lived with him alone before so he isnt danger for me)\n\nAnd I kinda feel guilty about it. The things he did to my mom are the same things she did to me all those years when she was angry. I just dont know what to do.\n\nWhen asked about it he says that my mother emotionally abused him. He was never mean or violent towards me my dad was a nice father maybe he wasnt always there but he tried tho. \n\nI can't live with my mom, but is it bad if I go live with my dad? I feel guilty because he hurted my mom but she hurted me all those years so I dont know if Im a bad person because I want to live with my dad who became physical towards my mom. \n\n\nAm i a bad person for moving in with my dad?\n\nEdit: Does anyone maybe have any advice for me Im only a freshman in highschool and I just want a normal life with normal parents.

I left him two years ago and I moved on rather quickly due to fact that a man I met gave the courage to finally leave my ex; I am still with that man today. \n\nMy ex and I were only a year apart in age. We dated throughout high school into my freshman year of college. He was affectionate at times, but I know now that most of that affection was to make up for the things he did to me; that was his way of apologizing for laying his hands on me, or calling me names and putting me down. He do one of those acts and then give me a hug, or a kiss and apologize a thousand times. \n\nMy current boyfriend is nothing like him personality wise. There is a six year age difference between the two of us (I'm 21, he's about to be 27). \n\nMy boyfriend has never laid a hand on me or insulted me. He's kind and he's understanding and he's done a lot to help with my PTSD from the last relationship. For example, he raised his voice one time and I shut down and started having a panic attack because I thought the next thing coming was him hurting me. I've had to lay boundaries for certain things and he understands; if he gets angry, he usually steps out so his frustration doesn't start causing me to have flashbacks. \n\nHe's not as affectionate though. I mean, he'll show affection in other ways such as paying for something for me, or surprising me with breakfast, or maybe the occasional gift, but there's no physical affection; the only time there is, is when we have sex.\n\nHe works in construction and of course, there's our age difference so it may happen once a week to a week and a half. I have a high libido so that causes some personal problems, but I crave that affection. \n\nMy therapist says I crave it because I need proof that he still cares for me; he says it stems from my mother walking out as well and my fear of being alone. \n\nI've brought it up with my boyfriend and he says that his dad is the same way. They're affectionate in other ways, but the physical affection is a different aspect; though he'll give me a hug when I'm having a rough day. \n\nThe problem is though is that it's caused this internal debate that tears me apart.

If it did not and the issues are related to other things at least I was able to just talk about it.\n\nI am a male, 25 and I did not think about it too much until about a year ago it just hit me and I can't stop thinking about it.\nSo aged between 7-9 is when it occurred, my cousin (a male) who was around 13-14 years old visited my town as usual for the school holidays and we often ended up playing and sleeping over at my grans house. What I remember is One day in the afternoon he brought me into his room closed the curtains and door then he said we would get into the bed to take a nap so I did I thought it was cool getting to chill with my cousin as I was the youngest of all of us by a few years. While in bed he made it like a cool game that I must not tell anyone it was naughty type of vibe so I was keen to do so and he pulled down his pants and kept telling me to kiss the his penis and I then did around 4-5 times and he did the same to me. I don't know how long we were there for I remember one of the adults calling for us and then I can't remember anything after that. I don't recall him doing it again on other occasions I have heard that kids repress memories so I can't be certain. I remember enjoying the experience and thinking it was so cool and looking back I can't believe I enjoyed such a terrible thing and I feel guilty that I did now. \n\nAt this age I had no concept of straight, gay or sex or anything like that, following that event I tried to do the same with 2 of my other male friends who were the same age as me as it was so cool and fun with my cousin. The first friend I tried to convince him it was fun and would be awesome and eventually we came right I kissed his penis and he did mine. The second friend however was different with him I remember being fully erect and laying on my back and got on top of me also on his back, we never had sex he kind of just got on top of me and that's that. I don't know where I learned that from but I don't recal seeing any example of it anywhere. My brother was sleeping in the next room and somehow found out about it he must have been spying on us and proceeded to blackmail me for the next few years.\n\nI feel like those events kick started a very unhealthy addiction to trying to see naked women and eventually a porn addiction. All this started from around 10-11 up till this current day, I am actively trying to beat the porn addiction. \n\nSo now you know what happened I will go over how I felt throughout my whole teen years up till now. \n\nI always remember being extremely unconfident in myself everyone around me always seemed to be better than me in every way from socialising to athletic skills and school work. I just hated being me in every way or form. Their parents let them go out and do cool things mine never let me go anywhere I always had to have my brother around cause my parents feared I would get peer pressured etc. My brother could go and do anything he wanted but I could never.\nPresent day my confidence is a bit better but it's still shot.\n\nSharing my feelings then and now is hard, I never was and am able to talk to my parents about my feelings whne my cousin came out as gay and my brother heard he broke down and told my parents about how my cousin molested my brother and when my dad asked me I just said he didn't do anything to me. I just don't share any feelings with them at all. I had a girlfriend for 2 years when I was around 17-19  and I never told them about it and I opened up to her the most I really loved her but I still kept a lot of stuff back, even doing sexual acts I always held something back. Whenever I have ever tried to talk about my feelings I mumble and ramble, my rhythm of breathing goes  wild it becomes a complete mess.  I generally have problems socializing I would not say I am a well spokem person by any means.\n\nDepression, according to an online depression test I am very depressed I scored 22/27.\nI always feel like I don't deserve to be happy, to have a wife, to be successful in something. I have changed careers 3 times now and every time I was making progress I would drop it and start a new one from scratch. Feels like I am self sabotaging to avoid success. The career I have landed in I do enjoy it (graphic design) but for as long as I can remember I have always struggled to get out of bed and do something with my life, I instead  choose to sleep the day away, procrastinate and browse YouTube to just kill time and avoid doing the only work I actually get satisfaction from.  A lot of things in life seem so unimportant to me no matter how hard I try, setting goals chasing dreams it all just never sinks into my heart and truly takes hold of me, instead in my mind I somehow always distill everything to be pointless and unimportant. Twice  I have thought about suicide and both time I was saying to myself that I am useless, worthless I don't contribute anything to the world I am just a parasite and burden to my parents why waste everyone's time. Fortunately I never went through with it.\n\nSorry for a long read, would appreciate your thoughts or if anyone has gone through or felt similar or even wnat to just share your own story.

I have many memories where my father would come back home with a foul mood and he try to find something small thing in the house to fuss about and all of a sudden he would start yelling and throwing stuff around making a big mess and forcee me, my sister, or mother clean it up. I would be getting teased and bullied in school and it effected my preformance and when my dad talked to me about I told him I was being bullied but he would tell me I was just making excuses and that it was my fault because i didnt pray or read my bible enough. My preformance got worst and every time i made a bad grade he would whip me tell me i was ruining my future and threaten to kick me out the house. He laughed at me everytime i expressed in interest in something like martial arts, or how I walked, or when i was stressed/angry about something and would get mad at me when I didnt find my situation as amusing as he did. So I ask was my father abusive or at least toxic or is it all in my head?

I'd say something he didn't like and he'd stop talking. That's it. Sometimes he'd even slowly walk up the stairs and go lay in bed. He wouldn't look at me. One time he put on headphones and started gaming. After me talking to him for 15 minutes he lifted up his headphones and said \"I didn't hear anything you said.\" He would focus on one sentence, no matter what nuance I added. And in the end I'd be forced to take back the specific sentence so everything would be fine again. I was constantly scared of saying one thing to him that would shut him up again, so I just didn't say my opinion that much to him. I started asking his opinion first and adaption to that.\n\nWhen he was in that mood I'd get scared. Of course I would. What if one day he just stopped talking, and not for minutes but for hours, or for days? What if I'd say one thing and he'd just... never talk to me anymore? I felt like every time he'd stop talking he'd love me less. So a few times I told him this.\n\nHe'd get angry at me for it. He'd accuse me of thinking that he didn't love me. He'd make it about him and make me feel even worse about the situation. Not only was the original argument suddenly not that big a deal but I had made it worse by bringing up my fears. It'd break me. I'd literally be on my knees next to the bed, trying to make him look at me. It'd be like he was the one scared of me.\n\nOne time instead of going after him to the bedroom and giving in to providing him that attention, I went to sit outside to think. When I walked back inside 20 minutes later he'd called my mom, telling her I'd ran away and scaring the shit out of her. Come to think of it, that was a way of keeping me inside after that.\n\nIf he said something I didn't like, he'd just become very flirty all of the sudden, touching and kissing me until I said \"fine\".\n\nIt always felt like I was the one fucking things up, doing things wrong, saying insensitive things. It was always my fault, no matter what. I thought this was just how it was.\n\nWhen we broke up he said the one thing he missed most about me was the sex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNowadays - a few months after breaking up with him - I'm dating another guy. He saw me go through the last few months of the relationship and was there for me as a friend. He was the outside perspective I needed to break up with my ex. There was one time where one of these arguments happened and I was right next to my current boyfriend shaking, trying to apologize for what I said, dragging myself through the mud for this guy. He couldn't believe his eyes.\n\nThere was a long time in the beginning of our new relationship that's I'd be absolutely terrified by the thought of losing him. And it took a long time but I told him. *He then said he was scared of losing me too*. Of course, he said. If you love someone, of course the thought of losing that would scare you. Jaw dropping stuff.\n\nWhenever I say something \"wrong\", that being something he doesn't agree with, he doesn't punish me for it. He doesn't make it about himself. Even if I physically do something wrong (one time his pc wouldn't start up because me jamming the power button), he doesn't put me down, he doesn't yell at me, he doesn't call me names. He just reacts like a normal person, I guess.\n\nHowever I still go into defense mode. I go into \"begging on my knees\"-mode. Making it a bigger issue than it is. It's getting better but every time I'm so hard on myself. I get angry at myself, I want to run and hide from him and the pain and fear makes it so that *I don't talk.* \n\nI'm on my way to getting better and he's told me he would love being there to see it happen. And I trust him. I'm never scared he'll love me less for my mistakes. I love him a lot and he loves me more than my ex ever did.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, rant over.

This vacation was necessary for me to find enough reason within myself to keep trying. Sometimes you just need a break, in order to break the knots of negativity you\u2019ve subconsciously been roped into from force of habit, lack of hope, and a lack of faith in yourself. \nI found renewed reasons to try, my mom has been the biggest inspiration. In the past few weeks, I\u2019ve felt like a child all over again, a child attached to the hem of her skirts. I had let reason fail me, I gave into things that made me angry and lose sight of my future, of what really mattered. I lost sight of what I\u2019d be walking away with (if this continued...) and what I\u2019d be losing a few years down the line. I didn\u2019t want those regrets, I wanted to win and yet I kept fighting it thinking my noise would eventually overpower his.\nI woke up last night feeling chilly. I turned off the fan, I sat down and thought about what I could do to better my situation. Where did I need to focus? How could I fix and better my situation? I was letting the noise affect me in a way that it completely took over and unseated my priorities. I\u2019m a sensitive person and emotional by nature. \nI had to block out the noise and the distraction that was causing me to slip up. I figured that it is not an easy feat but it could be managed to a degree, as long as I am smart about it and not highly reactive. And as long as I kept my focus and my eye on the game... I could create my own happy space and little bubble where I could focus on my career and personal goals. But I slipped up way more times than I have tried to succeed. Thus, I felt like a loser. I felt like a victim no one could understand. I kinda felt stuck because I was so passionate and put too much heart and effort into making things better. I tried to prove that I was worth loving, that I was a good partner. \n\u201cLife is not fair. Get over it,\u201d they said. \u201cDo you think I can\u2019t get a better girl than you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been with tons of girls and they\u2019re all beautiful women,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat makes you think you\u2019re special?\u201d \u201cI can just as soon get a girl way better looking than you, and smarter too. An entrepreneur just like me. You are a worker, a slave. You\u2019re ungrateful, that\u2019s what you are\u201d - that was how he spoke to me. He was extremely insecure and any mention of his behavior brought on a tirade of disrespect and how he must dump me immediately, he went on and on about how everyone he knew hated me, how he didn\u2019t have time to waste... and how he wished to focus on his business. i was silenced each time I tried to communicate with him.\nIn the beginning, I fought to be heard but he ignored what I had to say and kept talking over me, it escalated into a projection where he\u2019d find fault with me when instead it was his behavior, and lack of understanding which I wanted to address. He wasn\u2019t someone who appreciated empathy and emotion, he was culturally predisposed to the idea of any emotional sensitivity as being equivalent to weakness. He felt it\u2019s weak to display any kind of emotion and instead, a sign of strength to trample on others. He made it appear as though I was the wrong person for having an issue, or reason to complain. He never took any responsibility for his actions even when I brought it up sensibly. He viewed every attempt as a personal attack on him and fought hard to project the problem back on me. In fact, he ignored all the consequences and instead blamed me for everything, including the problem itself even though it didn\u2019t make sense at all. There was no use talking to him. \nI was brought up to trust that my emotions are a good indicator of my well being and mental health. One needs to be spiritually and emotionally healthy to be in a relationship. Most of the \u201cself-love\u201d crap people preach about relationships is a crutch for narcissists to continue selfishness and abuse. I\u2019m saying so because he used it to an extent where his self love transitioned into psychologically abusive and disrespectful behavior towards his partner, me. \nI\u2019ve always been confident in my own abilities but I let someone mess me up by the way they talked to me. I let their trash talk get to me. I tried to ignore the negative and then ignored it some more, and I found myself getting bullied and then I fought back. I lost precious time and energy in the process by fighting a man who used his mouth the way he used his asshole to desecrate the emotional healthiness of a relationship. He kept cheating on me emotionally too and did very little to make me feel good about myself. There was very little empathy and respect for my choices, options and what I liked. It was all about him. But to get out I need to stop letting him make me feel like that regardless of how he treats me.\nThe mouth is like an asshole, and whatever spews from it defines an individuals\u2019 insecurities way more than they try to break down your own perception of yourself. He tried to speak his words into existence, to make it a reality. I gained so many pounds, I stopped taking care of my health, I dressed down obscurely before leaving the apartment cuz he insisted that I never dress up or look good. Slowly, I was unable to attend events with friends because of how he wanted me to spend all my time home with him at home. He refused to move to St Pete with me when I spend every day driving 4 hours to my job and back home. I had a 10 hour workday and he worked from home. He basically put a stopper on my potential, and he held me back. I eventually couldn\u2019t handle the stress of working for a startup and eventually I quit. It was something I regretted. He didn\u2019t want to move when I insisted that it was essential for me. He wasn\u2019t a team player and saw me as competition. Something about me unsettled him. \nI felt isolated from my friends, he was putting me on curfew and judged my friends and anything I did with them in a very controlling way. He accused me of sleeping with my friends and having secret lovers. He still says I never appreciate him enough. With so many negatives, I do find it hard to appreciate him in a way that makes a difference to him. After all, how could I? \nI wanted to be wooed and romanced, taken care of from time to time in a relationship. However anything good that he did, he did it out of a sense of wanting to control me, not out of love. He says he cares a lot but his actions prove otherwise. If at all he\u2019s shown any empathy, it\u2019s short lived or right before sex. \nI realized that it\u2019s important to succeed, I must keep trying, and that there is no other way...it\u2019s important to keep my eye on what matters instead of listening to the noise. And he is all but noise.\n\n#ignorethenoise", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

stupid teen victim or they're really abusive\nMy family's situation is a bit complicated my family is a Muslim I am an atheist but obviously didn't really tell anyone\nIn Islam the age gap really doesn't matter to most which I disagree with the my mom's around 47 and my dad 73 it was an arranged wedding and Mom really dislikes him he abuses her on a daily basis emotionally as far as I know he didn't abuse her Physically when I was a kid I used to get hit by shoes, stick and one time when I was 4 or something around it locked in the basement and dad wanting to hit me with a thin metal mom used yo hit me with shoes , stick and pulling my hair my dad used to call me all kind of names and body shaming me since I can remember when I got older dad stopped really hitting me but I absolutely feared him mom began to only hit me if I do wrong like say something bad without really realizing cause I was a kid and dad swears a lot or if I get bad grades or forget a book or an exam Eventually when I was around 13( or 12 since my birthday is at the 10th month) my grades would drop or my mom would make me study extra which made doing the writing part of homework lasts until 12 a clock at night and more which was really painful making it hard to go through classes without feeling like my body is being hit by pricks at 14 my grades dropped  from 100 and 90s to 80s  90s sometimes 70s which was a big deal for mom since she was ashamed from me getting anything below 95 which led into a lot of shouting a lot of threats about taking away the internet since I have no friends in real life my only friends were really just online  or saying she will never talk to me any more she would hit me for refusing to study in the spring holiday ( we don't really get any homework in them so it all was just extra) And whenever I refuse to or get low marks she would hit herself or pull her hair saying what did she do to deserve a child like me then kinda attack me and chases me but my aunt normally stops her take her away then come to tell me it's my fault and I am hurting mom and need to apologize which I often end up doing one time I actually pulled through not begging her to forgive me and mom came hugged me and \"apologized \" To only end up saying she shouldn't cause it is my fault anyway in the spring holiday a problem happened between her and my step sister who's from the first wife we in general have a good relationship with them if anything mom treats her better than me and always puts her above me and to be honest I loved my sister and looked up to her a lot anyway a fight happens for first time my mom hits her she calls her brother her and mom kinda make up it didn't really seem that way to me seeing her anyway her brother came and attacked my mom physically and almost chocked her in front of me which was pretty scary for me to see anyway problem happened cops didn't do anything about it Just made my brother pay for the door he broke my sister got out of the house and my brother was kicked out for a day then just allowed on second floor and gets out using the backdoor and after it my grades were just 80s and 70s I had no motivation at all to study but tried my best out of fear from mom from then we got in a lot of fights about me not studying enough being lazy for wanting to sleep a lot and for feeling tired no matter how much I slept which I will admit I started sleeping an hour or two at the afternoon and sleeping at 10 or 9 a clock at night unless I had a lot of hw and I would say it was a lot on top of feeling tired I was feeling a lot of pain in my neck and back plus my entire body hurt in general  so fast forward to 15 this year's spring my grades were only 80 and 70s got into more fights she wouldn't talk to me whenever I tried to say to her how I am feeling lonely depressed stressed and that she doesn't care about anything but my grades and felt like she treated me like a doll with tears in my eyes she would completely ignore it and saying that I think she has a problems like my dad usually calls her insane and all I personally think she has problems of wanting me to be successful and pushing me to my limits cause of dad thinking I can only have a good life if I was a doctor and saying I am \" Smart \" And that's why she has faith I can do it with her help at spring holiday I didn't agree to study the extra cause another incident happened which was my brother abusing his wife( who's my aunt I know I hate it too and my aunt also hates it but her mom made her do it by saying she will never get married) which ended with a huge fight and mom said I study the extra or she will stop me from continuing school and make me do all the house work and clean it all( it's a pretty big house and no one actually cleans it fully since there are a lot of unused rooms with just furniture) I was just crying cause Not continuing school takes any chance I could have in leaving my dad ended up coming and giving mom shit for doing this and told me he loves me and all and that I am free to do whatever and mom won't force me anymore after it mom came and told me I am nothing without her and I will fail and cried saying I destroyed her life she did tend to say I am nothing without her a lot but the destroying part was first time I didn't know what to do and started cutting to see if it would help and it did  the next day I asked my online friends how to hide scars or get an excuse or something like that thinking they won't know I am cutting but deep down I knew they would and wanted them to know to be honest then I would have my grandma my aunt everyday fight saying how she made her life bad then another second both saying I am nothing without my mom and I should go beg her to forgive me and since I share room with my grandma I always hear her wishing to die I felt so depressed I ended up cutting more and whenever I get a not so good mark ot a teacher saying she expected more or something around that I just think they're right and I can't do good on my own mom would ask about my grades and they were 80s and 70s and she says that she's right and I can't do it and will get myself down to hell and will end up going back to her then I took 55 on a lesson that we won't ever study for the next years at all and when she knew about it she hit me and shouted at me saying how I am bad and I am nothing and that she will go back to teaching me and watching me herself cause I am taking my life down to hell funny enough in the next exams I got even lower grades with her than on my own and when a parents meeting happened everyone normally comes sits through the meeting then go to the principal and take their kids  ask teachers about them extra mom just left after signing that she's in and I spent 3 hours with only one other student and teachers not studying or anything just stuck waiting until it's officially time to get out and when I asked her why she said she felt too ashamed to let anyone see her then finals came I got better marks but still not good and I actually wanted them to be good and studied so hard and actually put care into it for mom to shout at me saying I didn't study enough and everyone gives all praise for good grades to mom and any decent or bad ones to be me wasting mom's work and I thought I won't have any arguments in holiday after this but she just shouts at me for things I didn't do or for having different opinion and would get so dam mad if I accidentally raise my voice a little when she's shouting so dam loud and would tell me to not talk at all and aunt and granny wants me to apologize to her even when she admits that mom started it saying she is stressed and has the right to let her stress on me and even if she hits me I should kiss her hands and say I love her just cause she's my mom and my aunt started saying I am bad cause my dad's blood or his side of the family's blood is in me so I am bound to be a bad person \nI just really hates how many

Back then, Cool! had an in-app webpage thing where you could connect with people in your area. \n\nMy username attracted interesting people, my abuser  (we\u2019ll call him Bryce) being one of them. He contacted me first, and I engaged in conversation with him a lot. I told him I was 18, but once we met it was obvious I wasn\u2019t and I told him the truth. He said he didn\u2019t care though, he said I acted mature for my age. He was 36 at the time. When we met, we agreed to meet one evening in a little sort of park area in my neighborhood. It was a private corner behind some tennis courts, so no one was really going to bother us. We sat in the grass and talked, he put his arm around me, and eventually before I had to go back home he got me back into one of the hidden corners of the park and pulled my pants down. I let him do it. I didnt fight back. \n\nAfter that, we still talked through Cool! and through various encrypted apps. As it progressed, he would be picking me up after school, taking me to his apartment, we would get high or drunk and have sex. Then he would take me home right when I asked him to. He was always good about getting me home on time, except for a few circumstances. That lasted for about a year. He didn\u2019t have a job, and he had pit bulls he refused to get rid of, so he got kicked out of his apartments and packed his stuff and went home to Oregon for a while. \n\nHe eventually came back to New Mexico and lived with friends, but ended up going back and forth between New Mexico and Oregon. His ex got ahold of one of his dogs at this point, and he had to give one up to the pound. He only had one left that he took with him wherever he went. I loved that dog. We were sneaking around then, since he didn\u2019t live without roommates. Usually all we did was just get rooms at various cheap motels because that\u2019s what I was, for whatever reason, comfortable with. \n\nAfter the second or third time he had to go back to Oregon, we stopped going to motels and he would just take me out by the lake or into the desert and pull off where there wasn\u2019t really anybody and we\u2019d have sex in the back of his car. One time, his car got stuck in a ditch along a desert highway, and it was too close to my curfew. I was in a dress, but I decided to just hitch hike and hope someone would come along and take me home. Thankfully, a mountain biker came around and went to get his truck. He brought me home, and I was safe. I realize how much more dangerous that could\u2019ve been, but I got lucky to live in a place highly populated by religious peoples. \n\nBryce and I fought over the fact that I ditched him there, but it wasn\u2019t anything new really. We fought a lot and it wasn\u2019t the first time. I slapped him a few times and he got extremely angry with me but he never hit me back. It was scary though. His angry face scared me. He would go weeks at a time without talking to me, just ghosting me and then all of a sudden popping back up with a \u201chi\u201d text. I was always stupid enough to reply to his texts right away, but I knew if I didn\u2019t he would just get angry with me. \n\nIn summer a few years after we met, I hung out with a new friend group, and they made me actually happy. I had met someone there that actually treated me decently. I officially broke up with Bryce in early August, even though for months leading up to that I made it very clear I was uninterested, I no longer wanted sex so everything done was nonconsensual. From there, things just got worse.\n\nHe threatened me, would create fake phone numbers just to text me horrible things, faked a suicide on the phone with me, and guilt tripped and manipulated me. I changed my number at least three times, and eventually gave up and got a new phone completely, but he still got it through someone we knew mutually and texted me. I gave up, and kept him unblocked only because it was easier than blocking six numbers a day. It was minimal contact actually, maybe once every few months after awhile, and he continued to manipulate me when he did contact me. \n\nA few weeks ago, he called me in tears telling me he\u2019s going to show me why I should\u2019ve cared about him, etc etc, saying he\u2019s going to kill himself and it\u2019s my fault. I told him I didn\u2019t believe him, and he wasn\u2019t going to find any sympathy from me because he was constantly pulling guilt trips like this, saying he was going to kill himself. I blocked him and he hasn\u2019t tried to contact me since. It shook me up though, and I decided I should just come clean to authorities about the entire thing sooner rather than later. \n\nThe whole thing since I initially reported him has given me extreme anxiety and stress, I can\u2019t sleep, I\u2019m terrified of everyone\u2019s judgement, I\u2019m tired of living in fear of him going through with his threats against me every day. On top of that stress, authorities have failed to keep in contact with me regarding the case and it seems to have been dropped altogether. I\u2019m afraid to reopen it because when I tried they yelled at me and made me cry. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nWhat Made Me Come to This Sub.\n\nI\u2019m afraid still of him coming to my house and harming me or my family, I know he has access to guns and I know he\u2019s addicted to drugs and isn\u2019t afraid of losing what little he has. I\u2019m afraid of going out in my town in fear of running into him. \n\nAt night, I keep myself up for hours on end thinking about everything he did to me. I wait for taps on my window or banging on my front door, for my dogs to go crazy. I give myself panic attacks just trying to do everyday things. \n\nIf I make plans with anyone, or even for myself alone, I have to make a strict itinerary and back up plans and I try to always make a way for me to get out of the situation should I need to. I end up writing, and rewriting, itineraries a thousand times before the trip straight down to the socks I plan on wearing each day. Even if I\u2019m going across the country, I get nervous about going to the airport in case he stalked me and somehow knows I\u2019m going to be there at 5:38 AM to catch a flight to so and so to land at 12:19 PM. \n\nIt\u2019s just hard for me to do everyday things. Even driving through town if I pass the motel he had sex with me in when I was blacked out and unconscious, or down roads he took me to do explicit things, I have to go home and cry. \n\nI\u2019m tired of feeling like this, like I\u2019m just a fool who fucked myself over to begin with anyway. I\u2019m tired of being afraid, of dragging down the people around me because I can\u2019t get a grip. I can\u2019t wait until I can afford to start seeing a professional to actually pick all this apart..\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nTL;DR.\n\nWhen I was young and dumb, I met a much older man on social media who manipulated me for a handful of years. When I finally put my foot down, he threatened me for months. I relive a lot of the memories and I\u2019m constantly afraid of him. It affects me heavily in things as little as trying to go across town or sleeping at night.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

But he loved accusing me of being jealous and insecure out of the blue when I did nothing.", "author": "CloudyMoonsRivers", "self_text": "What\u2019s really strange is my Nex (50m) was not jealous about me. Ever. I don\u2019t play those games so there was no reason for him to get jealous actually. I\u2019m (50f) a tall girl at 6 feet (or 2 meters) and long dark hair, so I have presence from that, he never mentioned men looking or noticing me. Never. Even if I suspected a man was eyeing me, he didn\u2019t say anything.\n\nFrom the beginning, he used to talk about how great his exes were, all the women he\u2019d had sex with (lots) sometimes details like, \u2018on the first date she wanted to have sex in her car, I didn\u2019t want to so I settled for her giving me a blowjob\u2019. All kinds of rude and crude comments. I don\u2019t talk that way so I just listened. One time I showed irritation with all that bullshit talk, he accused me of being insecure and not being able to handle he had a life before me and screaming with a disgusting vile tone. So after that, I didn\u2019t say anything about that talk again. Just tolerated it without reaction.\n\nWhenever we went out he would make comments about women, their clothes, looks, etc, whatever came to his mind he blurted out, he would actively look around the room, watch women walk by, crank his neck, as if I wasn\u2019t there. Early on I calmly asked curiously why he was staring at a table of 3 women for the last 10 minutes at an outside bar. He blew the fuck up in front of other people at the bar. Started ranting right then and there about how insecure and jealous I was and he shouldn\u2019t have to put up with it. He stomped off to the parking lot still yelling, drove to his house for an hour in silence. I learned at that moment to show no reaction to any of these above behaviors. \n\nThe last time we went to a bar before discard, we walked in and he said with that vile tone \u201cthere\u2019s quite a few chicks here, you\u2019ve got competition\u201d. I said nothing, I pretended I didn\u2019t hear it, I wasn\u2019t going to feed him supply. WTF. There were a lot of men there too, and a bunch of them were standing not far from where we sat. I suspect they were noticing me because we didn\u2019t stay long even though it was a good band. Other than those 2 isolated times I mentioned here, I didn\u2019t react to his stupid talk and double standards about the opposite sex. Maybe that\u2019s why he accused me frequently of being so insecure or jealous?\n\nSo back to my question; my Nex-Douche wasn\u2019t jealous about other men. He didn\u2019t make comments or reference about men looking at me, he could care less, or maybe it made HIM feel good if men were looking at me. But he sure went nuts when I asked those two times, and many other times he\u2019d tell me I was insecure and jealous when I did nothing. It\u2019s like he loved thrashing me with those 2 words (insecure / jealous) with this horrible cutting tone. Jealousy is the only trait he didn\u2019t have in an otherwise full textbook narcissist. I read on here about jealous Narcs, but mine wasn\u2019t in the slightest, he could have cared less what other men were doing in my presence.

I am going to appologize upfront if this is poorly orgonized, but my relationship with my wife has been going on for about 8 years now and there is just a lot going on. \n\nI will start to say that my wife and i have been married for 7 years and we have been together for 8. We had a short dating period and then also a short engagement because i was moving away for work and we had decided it was good to keep it going. To be honest there were some warning signs of our incompatibility but at the time i figured it was impossible for a person to be \"perfect\" so i accepted those as her Quarks.\n\nI was raised by two loving parents who would do anything for eachother. So whenever my wife was feeling sad I always wanted to do whatever I could to cheer her up. This happened alot during our first year of marriage because she was pregnant and we had moved to an area she was not familiar with at all. She left her friends and her job for me, so her sadness was understandable and justified.\n\n The first time I realized I lost all control in the relationship was when we were talking about our 5 year plan that we had talked about. We initially decided we would get pregnant and she would finish her college and then we would have another. By the time the 2nd kid was in pre-school she should be done with school and able to get a job. However being away from her home and her job she was urning for something of her own, when i tried to remind her about our plan she snapped and yelled at me accusing me of trying to control her whole life.  So naturally i let her persue her needs, because i wanted her to be happy.\n\nI won't bore everybody with every detail of every encounter, but i'm going to hit some of the big ponts.\n\n\\- I cannot have any friends of my own; If a person cannot present any meaningful networking opportunities they are not allowed to be my friend. I'm not allowed to have any friends that cannot \"get us somewhere\". She forces me to hang out with guys i have nothing in common with because those people are people of power and i should get to know them. I obviously screw up her \"plans\" because i'm a nerd and the people she forces me to talk to arn't and therefore we aren't super friends. I was hanging out with one of the guys i Semi get along with once and i met one of his colleages who is also a nerd and he and i hit it off. When i told my wife about it she asked what we talked about...when i told her \"nerd stuff\" she scoffed, rolled her eyes and said \"typical\".\n\n\\- Her misfortune is all my fault; We have moved a few times for my job. The most recent place we both decided would be a good place to go. however after she quit a job she didn't like she again was having a difficult time to find a new job. This is all because we are in this bad location \"because of me\". she omits the fact that we discussed our next location together and agreed upon this location. \n\n\\- She deals in absolutes; my wife speaks about things in ultimatims to both myself and our daughter. \"If you dont finish your fucking cheeze you won't get a birthday party this year\" or \"if you don't get a promotion or we move, i'm leaving you\" or \"if you leave me or cheat on me i'll cut your balls off\".....This hurts my daughter most of all because a 6 year old girl does not understand that this yelling parent doesn't REALLY mean that they will throw out all of her toys if she doesn't give someone a good bye hug. \n\n\\- My memory \"is never correct\"; I'm not going to lie my memory isn't perfect some times. when things are less than important i have a tentancy not to remember it. She then uses this in any argument saying my memory is not reliable and i'm just simply wrong. \n\nI'm going to stop here with the examples. Because I would write a book....I will wrap up with this; I cannot lose my daughter. She is my whole world, I'm scared that while my wife is emotionally abusive at times, she will twist things and everything to get full custody just to get back at me, when infact she hates being a mother because it keeps her from having a \"real job\". It breaks my heart to see my daughter cry because my wife is yelling at her for a tiny problem. I want to stand up to her but i know every time i do she snaps back with 10x the fury, and i don't want to be in a position that could result in her walking out the door with my daughter.\n\nThank you for reading this far, I probably need to find some professional help, but she has flat out refused couple's counceling and she keeps a tight watch on my schedule so I likely cannot see someone for an hour without my wife assuming i'm cheating on her or something.....and on top of that she has no concept of money so we spend all of our extra money on things she wants so i have very little for myself.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I have never been unfaithful in any sense to him or anyone else. \n\nI'll add my original post here if anyone wants to read it, but up above summarizes it fairly well. I guess I'm just looking for some help on how to move forward. I'm thinking of leaving him but I'm afraid, and I do still love him and would rather just fix this. Some people did question his mental health, and yes he is in therapy and has depression. I just don't think that's enough reason for his behavior. \n\n\"First time posting, so bare with me lol. I have been with my current boyfriend for a few months and it's been going really well. We both love each other and for the most part have a happy relationship. \n\nHowever, there have been a few incidents where we struggle. He has, on a few occasions made negative comments about my appearance (usually my makeup, outfit, or hair), or something about my character. For example, he repeatedly tells me how ugly my favourite pair of shoes are, or that I'm weak, a pussy, etc. As isolated incidents, I don't care too much. I can get over it or blame it on it being a bad joke. It's not really a big deal. \n\nSome of his comments though, get in the way of my life. I can't wear anything slightly revealing or any dresses without him saying that it's to show off to the guys at work. The dresses being an issue because I might sit with my legs open to show myself off to customers or my boss (I wouldn't).\n\n I also have danced my whole life, and recently started taking classes again after a big injury. It was a big deal for me and I was very proud of getting back into it after such a set back. Anyway, he was very upset and wouldn't talk to me because he didnt want me going. His reasoning was  because I previously mentioned that proper clothing meant no bra/underwear under tights and a leotard. Now, ballet for me (and the vast majority of people) is nothing even remotely sexual. Yes, you wear tight clothes but it's for a functional purpose. Just like gymnastics, figure skating, swimming, etc. I have done it since I was a toddler so it's very natural for me to jump into that kind of uniform. I never thought anything of it until he nearly left me over it. He just thinks people are eyeing me or somehow it's going to lead me to be unfaithful. I offered to dress more modestly in class, but that didn't seem to help. \n\nSo, now I'm not allowed to take classes and half of my wardrobe is unwearable. I feel like he's trapped me in a box because I feel so limited in what I can do/wear without him making me feel poorly about myself, or him having a meltdown. \n\nOn numerous occasions I have brought this up in as polite a way as I can, only for me to end consoling him because he's the one that gets upset in the end. He feels guilty about it for a short time, and goes on and on about how terrible a person he is, and how we should break up because I deserve better. As I type this at work he's texting me about what a trash person he is. I try to be as sympathetic as I can, I know he struggles with depression and was cheated on in the past. Because of that I understand where he's coming from. I just can't help but feel it's borderline manipulative. I sometimes hate how I end up feeling like I have somehow done something wrong when he is the one insulting me or restricting my activities. \n\nI hope that all makes some sense. I'm not super concerned about who is right and who is wrong, I just have no idea how to move forward in a healthy way, so any advice is appreciated. Not talking about my feelings is unhealthy but I don't like bringing them up because of how upset it makes him. To be clear, I have never even thought about cheating on him, let alone done anything. And I don't want to break up over something I didn't do. \n\nI hope that all makes sense, and thank you for reading. \n\nTl;dr - my boyfriend makes hurtful comments about me that at times, diminish my self esteem and put restrictions on what hobbies I can do. When I bring it up, he feels like a bad person and threatens to leave me, I end up consoling him, and we make no progress.\"", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He would hit me, and i would apologize to him for \"making him do it\".

Guess what? ***It somehow flipped on me***, and I APOLOGIZED FOR INVADING HIS PRIVACY. \n\n***I was not allowed to hang out with friends/family***. If I did, he would call repeatedly until I answered and harass me to the point I had to leave to go home because I was so upset.

If I questioned it, or brought that up.... all hell would break loose. \n\nHe eventually ***blocked me on all social media*** because I kept tagging him in pictures/posts. Another reason he blocked me was because a guy would like my status. He didn't want to see a guy like my status. Even if it was my own brother. That was a reoccurring argument that went on for years, he did not get over it.\n\n***The accusations***. He accused me of doing him wrong all the time.

He knew I had nobody else to run to, he knew what to say to make me come back everytime. He knew my weaknesses and used them against me. I made too many excuses for his behavior because of LOVE. How he treated me was not love, he didn't love me, he wanted someone to toy with, someone to use... after 4 YEARS, I found the strength to stand up for myself, eventually he got tired of it and found another girl to prey on...

We\u2019ve been LDR for most of the time, but since I decided to move to his town, our relationship progressively deteriorated.\n\nHe\u2019s always been a peculiar person, with a very unique character and habits. But I always thought our relationship would be stronger than any problem, so I ignored some of the weirder signs and kept going.   \n I would describe myself as a very empathic, sensitive, and sometimes overemotional person. I suffer from anxiety since I was a teenager and had bouts of low self-esteem.\n\nSince our problems began, I stumbled upon the definition of covert narcissist, and I\u2019m starting to wonder if my SO fits the description. I must say that after everything that happened between us, I already decided to break up with him, but still have to tell him.\n\nSo, these are some of the \u201csigns\u201d\u2026 or maybe not? I doubt my own perception every time, and I don\u2019t want to be the \u201ccrazy\u201d one, but I do have a lot of doubts.\n\n1. He\u2019s always been very closed up (emotionally) and secretive. He wouldn\u2019t tell me a lot of things about his past, his relationship with his dysfunctional family, even the most silly and daily stuff. He always claimed that it was his way of being. He improved a little bit on this, now he tells me the menial stuff and some more important stuff, but still keeps the biggest stuff secret.\n\n2. He likes to \u201cprovoke\u201d me telling me things he knows upset me or something about stuff I find sensitive or important (eg: I\u2019m very openly anti-racism and anti-sexism, and he enjoyed telling racist and sexist stuff with a straight face), making me up all riled up and then not telling me openly that it was a joke. He thinks it\u2019s funny, I agree to disagree.\n\n3. He\u2019s extremely passive about everything and anything. To the point that I usually take care of organizing, managing every daily thing (including meals, dates, vacations) up to every little detail. When it comes to vacations, I used to be the one planning every single thing, but he sometimes got upset if something was not as he expected it (but without putting any effort into the planning)\n\n4. He could be terribly emotionally detached. We would often fight, and he would stonewall me, giving me the silent treatment, and no matter how much I pleaded him to talk to me, he wouldn\u2019t do it. So I sometimes ended up crying out of frustration (feeling also guilty), and he would just\u2026 stare at me, with a blank expression on his face, like he felt nothing at seeing me cry. I always felt bad for my emotional reaction and regretted it every time.\n\n5. He would have these \u201cmoods\u201d, where he would become somber and seemingly upset (but calm), with no reason. I would ask him why he would act so cold all of a sudden, but he never ever explained. These moods lasted hours, with me worrying like mad because I was afraid I was the cause of it (even though he always told me it wasn\u2019t me). Then, after a while, his mood would switch again to a nice, kind one. I never got him to explain why he would act like that, and he would deny his mood switches.\n\n6. He never admits he\u2019s wrong, nor apologize. In 5 years, he apologized only two times: once because he acted like an asshole, I called him out on that, and then begged him to apologize because I couldn\u2019t pretend that thing didn\u2019t happen. The other time it was when he finally understood he was losing me, and we could break up\u2026 but he did it so begrudgingly.\n\n7. Since our last fight, he accused me of everything I wanted to tell him: he told me I was selfish for not going with his plan of buying a house with his money (I don\u2019t have enough, and asked him to wait until I got more savings), he told me I didn\u2019t want to understand him and I wouldn\u2019t change my way of living (after I moved from my hometown to his town, leaving my family and friends behind).  \n Oh, it\u2019s also never his fault. If I try to call him out on something, he backtracks and uses the \u201cwhat about you, then?\u201d argument.\n\n8. He showed little empathy for my problems, claiming that he already has a lot on his plate, and blatantly telling me he doesn\u2019t give a damn about mine. I understand he has big issues with his family, but why would he refuse to support me, even for a little while?\n\n9. He is very much bent on \u201cwinning\u201d, whether it\u2019s a game or a fight. He wouldn\u2019t approach a discussion with the intention of seeking compromise, but rather to prove that he\u2019s the most logical and rational one, and therefore his argument \u201cwins\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re just emotionally incompatible, or if there is something else. He comes from an emotionally abusive family, and I think there\u2019s partly the reason why he acts like that.  \n I used to feel so guilty about him until recently, because he used the family card as an excuse for his poor behavior and to convince me to go with his plan of buying a house I\u2019m not ready to buy.\n\nPlease, help me shed some light. I keep telling myself that maybe I\u2019m the asshole, but I can\u2019t help but suffer. I\u2019ve been suffering for months now, and I want to see this clearly.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I guess my lesson I learned today is that we have to move to parallel parenting where we only have necessary communication regarding important child-related information and that's it. I hate that I have to deal with him for the next 18 years. \\*\\*sob\\*\\*", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I stayed some days at his place but it all went to shit. I slept in the couch because I wasnt comfortable sleeping next to my ex, after what had happend with the friend I trusted. The next night I slept in the bed with my ex, he knew not to touch me in my sleep, yet I woke up with him fingerfucking me. \nThe next day he apologized. Said he knew how awful that must have made me feel and how terrible he felt. I believed him.\nThe next night I woke up to him masturbating next to me while rubbing my ass.\nI went home after that. \n\nWhy is he so horny for me right then? Why didnt he want me when i was awake and could give consent? Why would he recreate the assault, not one but twice? Is it only hot when I dont want it? Is it only hot when its abusive? What the fuck?

I looked up the personality traits of one and almost everything applied to him.  He wouldn't wanna be bothered w me if we weren't getting along, would flat out press the ignore button when i called.  He would never admit he ever did a thing wrong, in fact said everything in the relationship that was an issue was my fault.  He even told me my dog is gonna die soon. I was sitting on the floor petting my dog and he goes \"how old is your dog?\" I said \"almost 13.\" He said \"dogs only live to be like 15 so he's done soon.\" I said \"wait what,\" he goes \"honey he is done soon.\" I said \"why would you say that?\" He goes \"honey he is done soon.\" And i just kept being like \"wtf\" and he would just repeat it. Then i kicked him out of my house for saying it and he goes \"i told you the truth and it hit you like a shit ton of bricks.\" Then later on the car ride home he started calling me telling me he loves me and still never accepting the blame for it just simply stating that it came out wrong. It didn't. He meant exactly that.  Then i was upset w him so he almost completely ignored me the next two days because HE needed time and couldn't believe I yelled at him.  The relationship was full of highs and lows of him either saying snide remarks to me or ignoring me cause he could..to going into a lovey dovey phase. Fast forward to the breakup. I was annoyed by him so i didnt talk to him for one day, just so i could clear my head.  He wasn't reaching out to me either, so it's not like i was ignoring him. I reach out to him the next day( this past sunday) and he tells me his feelings are gone (just days ago told me i mean the world to him and hes so crazy about me). Told me he is over me. Told me everything is all my fault and i always argue w him(he starts many of these so called arguments) and told me he is over it and has moved on (in one day.) I spent the weekend crying thinking it may be over and then sunday finding out none of what he felt was real anyways. I cried my eyes out at work on monday to the point where my manager offered me a personal day today. I took it. Figured its better than crying at work. But I am not crying today, just am angry someone could pretend to love me.  He also claimed i pressured him into saying those things, i never did, he said them from the beginning before i ever did.  I feel totally gaslighted.  Its a mixture of sadness and anger. I know i cant really stay sad over him cause clearly the \"sweet\" guy who said all those caring things was just his persona. Now havent spoken to him since Sunday. I feel so damn stupid.  He never even cared about my orgasm..only his. He never cared if he made me cry or if he hurt me. But if I hurt him or wounded his ego..this is what it turns into. And then to be blamed for everything, like I was the problem. He would go from telling me how beautiful I am and that he's falling for me..to acting like i dont matter in a day's time. He even said to me \"I've never done anything wrong to you!\" And lashed out on me when I told him he is verbally abusive.  He goes\" you will NEVER tell me that again.\" I feel like i need therapy now...i have no clue how to feel or what just even happened to me.

Can someone help me break the cognitive dissonance I have right now", "author": "pointbroke321", "self_text": "I posted yesterday about how he started his rage cycle again. He had been fine for a few days, so of course I was lulled into a false sense of security yet again. After so many years, you would think I would be passed that now, but no. The stupid hope that maybe, just maybe it would last this time was there.\n\nYesterday, he woke up in one of his moods. I am not paying him enough attention and if I don't change that, he will find someone that will... again. I don't know, maybe I am being selfish and unreasonable because he wants to hang out at night, but that turns into coerced sex which makes me feel degraded. I am also so tried as I get up with the kids, work, take care of everything and, in addition, I feel so depressed because of his antics that I just want to be left alone. Ffs, I am so depressed right now, I don't even want to spend time with my kids, which is awful. But when you are told you are a piece of shit mom over and over, you just don't want to.\n\nI laid down a boundary which I am going to enact if he cheats and humiliates me again. I will go to a shelter with the kids. Last time he did it, he made me lose my mind and his behavior was damaging my little ones. The abuse that comes along with triangulation is the worst. He had his positive supply from the piece of trashy shit he cheated with and got all his negative supply from abusing me, playing me, making me feel so worthless and having me snap and engage by shouting back.\n\nHe said if I take the kids, he will have me arrested for kidnapping (I know, he can't). Then he said he will take the kids out of state and I will never see them again.\n\nFull day of his bullshit. He called me crazy, evil, the devil, the abuser, how I am the narc. I stood up to him and said I see right through him. I see what he is doing. I see that breaking me down is how he builds himself up. How he gets absolute pleasure in abusing me. How I am finally standing up for myself. I told him his gaslighting isn't working and I won't fall for it.\n\nBut I have.\n\nWhat made it worse was his covert narc mother spoke to him. She revels in causing drama.  She told him some Bs I apparently said. She knows when he is like this it Stokes the flames. Fuck knows why she just can't leave the hell alone. It feels like they all take pleasure in his abuse, unless of course it turns on them, then he is the most toxic person in the world. She also loves to blame me for him abusing me and tell me if I would just X, Y, Z he would be okay.\n\nSo today it is carrying on. He is being an assinine asshole. Putting me down, calling me abusive. The cognitive dissonance I assured myself wouldn't kick in, kicked in. I am now in the \"what if I am the abuser\" mode.\n\nHe also said he is standing up to me and my abuse. I am so passive it makes no sense. I don't know why he even thinks or says that. He causes all the problems with his rages and then says he does it to stand up to me because I am abusive toward him. Really, I don't think I am. I reflect about what I did and can see so little other than getting sucked into JADE and his DARVO.\n\nAt this point, I have no self esteem left. I am so depressed. I have extreme dissociation. I feel like I live in a tiny area of my brain. I don't feel like I exist in any capacity other than to be a whipping post.\n\nOf course, he also says I just play victim, that I never mention his side or what I did wrong. But his side is always so fake and false, like he pretends to be passive old me who just gets rages at for no reason when it truly is the other way around. He is a seething ball of rage, hate and vindication. I am generally easy going and laid back. Why is he turning this on me?\n\n\nAm I just misrepresented my part? He told all his fms how abused he and the kids are by me. Maybe I am just such a narc I don't see it. But I don't rage for no reason. I don't construct ego injuries based on nothing. I tell my truth about what he has done to me.\n\nI am sorry, I am in fog and confusion. Any thing to help untangle this, even if it is to confirm what he says about me, would be appreciated. Because if it is me and I am the issue, I truly want to change. I don't want to be that person that I see he is to me, or maybe perceive. I don't know, I feel so incredibly fucked up mentally right now.\n\nBy the way, leaving is not currently an option. I am working on in. The shelter is an extreme measure I will only use if it gets to the point it was before because other people are much more in need than I am. Right now, he isn't violent (he has been in the past), and I feel like a shelter is better for a person who is in immediate danger.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

{"post_id": "cjyz1c", "created_utc": 1564524578, "title": "Any experience with this type of narcissist?", "author": "dmg1111", "self_text": "One reason I am realizing that it took me until last week to realize my wife is a narcissist is that she is quite open about how pathetic she thinks she is. Her father is a narcissist himself and he completely destroyed her self-esteem - one story she brings up is how he dropped her off at college and told her she wasn't smart enough to go there, and people would know soon enough - which he said because he wanted to make sure she wouldn't be blindsided by her inevitable failure.\n\nAnybody who met her out in the world would be shocked to find out she's a narcissist. She's disorganized, very high anxiety, chronically late, lacks the confidence to change jobs, can't cope with even mild conflict and obsesses about having potentially inconvenienced people. She tells people about how great I am with our kid and how do I most of the work around the house. Her mom told her that she basically doesn't have to do anything (i.e. I intuit or overhear things and take care of them) and she agreed.\n\nThe narcissism is reserved for just a handful of people - me, my mom, her mom, sometimes her dad, and periodically a few of her long-term friends (I hesitate to call them 'closest'). Our home life is a disaster - never-ending nit-picking and criticism from her, hypocritical rule-making, no empathy, a refusal to apologize or acknowledge any failings, contradiction and negation of seemingly innocuous things I say and an obsession with my eating habits. She expects me to do all kinds of things for her 100% of the time - she refuses to buy groceries, she wants to sleep in every morning rather than taking care of our child, she refuses to set up playdates (she's afraid of the park and stressed out by kids playing, in addition to wanting me to do everything for her), she expected me to wash all of our milk bottles, when we go to somebody's house she expects me to do child care while she talks to adults - and she never once willingly gave me a day off. She has even complained that I go to work too often. She gets angry at me when I get sick and when I once sprained my ankle (I tripped on the stairs while she was yelling at me), she was so angry at me for not being able to walk for 10 days. One common trope is for her to say something mean (e.g. \"we talked about this and we agreed, and you're still not doing it right\") in a cruel tone and then insist that she's \"not mad, just giving me information\" and I have no right to be hurt. I asked her to speak to me nicely and she said that would be \"inauthentic\". (I can obviously go on and on and on here...) I have never seen much evidence of the nice side of her manipulative personality.\n\nHer mother is extremely cheap and has lots of anxiety around waste (e.g. saves aluminum foil, reuses paper towels), which I think mutes my wife's sense of entitlement in other aspects of her life. She doesn't seem to have any expectations of unearned material items as far as I can tell aside from periodic complaints about not having a master bathroom. She would rather use her narcissism to complain about me buying coffee or flushing the toilet too often (she stopped flushing for #1) or using two squares of paper towel instead of one.\n\nI got us into couples counseling - she obviously didn't lift a finger, and she can't even get ready on time. The 2nd therapist we saw had some moments of clarity - she agreed with me privately, and she told my wife that she has no empathy, that as a mother she can't expect to just lose track of time, that the way she speaks is \"jarring\", and that she can't expect me to respond positively to the mean things she says (e.g. when she complained for the umpteenth time that I had turned her into a bad environmentalist because I didn't sort thin-film plastics the way she wanted.) But the therapist also felt so sorry for my wife because of the trauma inflicted by her father that she never really followed up beyond her original observation in each case. The tone of the sessions eventually turned into the therapist telling me that I was the one who had to change! Obviously my wife loved her, and they started doing individual work together. I had to have my therapist tell the couples therapist that she couldn't do both, and so now (thankfully) I never have to see that couples therapist again.\n\nAt any rate, I am still processing the realization that she's a narcissist, and trying to figure out what's next.

When he sat down for dinner he often didn't eat much, presumably because he'd been snacking all day.\n\nI, on the other hand, was on a low carb / no sugar / strict diet, mostly due to a metabolic condition I was managing. I generally didn't eat most kinds of snacks and certainly nothing like him. \n\nWhen I sat down after working all day, and having not eaten anything since breakfast, I'd be hungry compared to him. As a result of that, he'd often tell me I ate a lot.\n\nWhat cracked me up the most is days he'd say that in response to me eating literally only lettuce and spinach leaves. No dressing. Few toppings. Mostly just a little salt... In reply I'd tell him he was misunderstanding, as a person has to eat a lot of lettuce leaves to fill up - And that the total calories were like a couple hundred.\n\nHe did the same I recall with eating only plain steamed veggies. Again, he'd say I eat a lot. Same type of reply from my end: This is veggies and very little calories.\n\nHe'd claim to be concerned and worried. Emphatically. That I needed to see the doctor. That my metabolic condition must really be 'off'...\n\nThen. No big surprise. Shortly after dinner, he'd eat more snacks or snack cakes; periodically throughout the night... If anything: I'd eat celery with salt (which as you guessed, looked like 'a lot' to him).\n\nStarting to think about lack of object constancy here as part of the N mindset. I think aside from taking jabs, it's possible that his N mind couldn't see context... Eating a pack of Little Debbies is a small item (though an unhealthy and calorie/fat dense one).

Her mother - was not. My father - my mother's husband - was a total explosion hazard while he was here. Now he's gone off to retire, and my mother's parents are both dead. My mother says her parents weren't really that great a match. He was an anesthesiologist, she has a farm girl. He supposedly married her to pay his tuition. My mother was supposedly run out the entire country when my mother pointed out the obvious: he had a side wife complete with side kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell in my family's case, there was no side lay to my knowledge. But everything else was there, I realized yesterday that my mother wanted to marry trash because she was trying to reenact her childhood and become her own mom, complete with all the futile and self-defeating aspects that suggests. She did not want someone to get along with herself and the kid. She and he were both looking for the same thing: a fight. I don't know what happened to my father when he was a kid, but to put it in a mild and family-friendly manner, he says he got hit.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut the consequences to others of someone's conduct are more about them than about the other person, meaning it's more than half indiscriminate and unconditional. So by hitting me, my father created a situation in which people were indiscriminately and unconditionally hit. My mother's reenactment failed because it went too far and went on too long. Both of them abused me, and I battered both of them, because it seemed like self defense. There are several possible reasons why this happened in my case and not in her parent's family's case. They include the 2003 Iraq War, and that she involuntarily committed me, the outpatient commitment from which only made things fit everyone's definition of worse. The first time I physically abused my father, he made an ultimatum during an argument. I Asperger's hand-flapped a chair onto his forehead in response. We then fled war together, and in the foreign country my father exploded. So I drew a knife on him and my mother got some of that because of the simple fact she was standing next to him. She involuntarily committed me four times, and during one of the times, the hospital injected a drug that made me recite the Martha Mitchell Effect article, and so they injected a muscle cramp drug. I started suffering from migraines while the Clozapine and the explosive anger raged through my weakened form.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is one thing she may have accomplished this way: she may have reenacted the disaster, but this time without the infidelity. If this was her goal, then she succeeded.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell I don't and did not consent. I hereby condemn the reenactment of our parents' mistakes. Removing one mistake from your parent's lives isn't enough, you must remove all of them; women, don't become your moms and marry your fathers, men, don't become your dads and eff your moms. Don't be a mofo. Be kind to your kids and be careful not to make ultimatums at them.

I need to write this down.

Different jobs, different guys, different dick pics, same old shit. \n\nI always forgave. \n\nShe always did it again.\n\nI think this final time, I had been already looking for a way out. \n\nI had been terribly unhappy for years.\n\nShamefully, I wanted her to do it again so I would have a chance to leave. Shamefully, I was checking up on her.\n\nThe evidence was not *as strong* as before. No dick pics this time (or yet) just her telling a guy at her new job how attractive he was, and how she was \u201cbasically single\u201d because of my long hours etc. Really flirting and giving him strong signals that she was interested.\n\nWell, that\u2019s all I saw. \n\nWhat clinched it was when I found that she had used my credit card to buy software to COMPLETELY erase iPhone records. No trust. No respect. How could I be so stupid? \n\nI deserve better.\n\nYes, I was paranoid, and I was always checking after the first few times this kind of thing happened. Looking for a reason to justify how hurt I was when the first time 7 years ago I casually saw her phone flash up with \u201cWhen are we going to fuck then?\u201d \n\nLooking for the undeniable \u201cproof\u201d of her treating me like shit on her shoe. \n\nGod knows why I felt I needed it.\n\nI kept forgiving. \n\nI don\u2019t know why. \n\nBut this time I managed to express how little respect she seemed to have for me.

I could do what I wanted to do. I could be where I wanted and hang around with who I wanted. I was feeling confident again.\n\nBut I still didn\u2019t leave.\n\nI\u2019m the majority breadwinner, and even though I had planned to go, I told myself I couldn\u2019t do that to her. I wanted her to find somewhere she could afford. We have two dogs we both adore. It was too hard to leave her.\n\nAnd slowly we crept back into an \u201caffectionate relationship\u201d.\n\nJust a couple of weeks ago she was pushing to share rooms and lives again. \n\nShe had changed. \n\nShe was being better. \n\nI took her on a couple of \u201cdates\u201d. She saw my friends again. \n\nThey put up with her frostiness. \n\nThe control came back so slowly that it was like boiling a frog from the cold - they don\u2019t notice they are in trouble until it is too late.\n\nBut something had **never** been right. \n\nShe was always explosive, and always texting me/ringing me whenever I wasn\u2019t around. \n\nChecking up on me. \n\nTelling me she didn\u2019t like certain friends and openly criticising my family. \n\nSweet as pie to everyone\u2019s faces of course (save for the odd cutting joke at my expense, or embarrassing barked command).\n\nI looked after her. Paid the bills, cooked the meals, walked the dogs. \n\nShe changed career and took a 10k+ pay cut. I supported that financially. \n\nBut I wasn\u2019t allowed to ask if it was a good idea or to discuss it. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t worth a horrible scolding if I upset her.  \n\nI didn\u2019t want her to spend time with me and the friends that she didn\u2019t like, where she might do something to deliberately embarrass me. \n\nThat became \u201cyou never want to spend time with me\u201d. \n\nBut we spent all of our lives together.\n\nShe told me that the reason that she constantly checked up on me was because of my Bipolar disorder and my previous drug abuse.\n\nOnly she could look after me she said. \n\nAnd she had, I think. She had \u201csupported\u201d me, but always ready to demean or be derogatory about it.\n\nEvery time I went out - \u201cyour friends don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like living with the aftermath, so I\u2019m checking that you are safe and where you are\u201d every ten minutes. \u201cI didn\u2019t care about her\u201d if I left it fifteen to respond. Even if I was at work I\u2019d be \u201cignoring her\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m a successful businessman, now that I\u2019m recovering - but she \u201cdoesn\u2019t like work you\u201d, \u201cyou are fake around them\u201d and \u201cthey don\u2019t know what you are like\u201d. She doesn\u2019t respect my biggest achievements.\n\nShe often threatened to come to my work and tell me off if I questioned her even slightly. She knows that would fuck things up for me.\n\nBut everything was me. \n\nEverything was me being aggressive when I was reacting to unacceptable behaviour or even if I was just disagreeing.\n\nShe started doing that again. \n\nThreatening to embarrass me over perceived slights. \n\nI just fell back into accepting it and accepting the blame.\n\nThere was a red line though...\n\nOn Friday, I had a work night out with my staff. \n\nNo partners, just a payday shoot the shit. \n\nI had said I would be back at 9pm. I was too scared to say any later. I knew I wanted to stay with my employees and bond, have fun. But I\u2019d go home early as I often did  to save the grief. \n\nSo at 7 she\u2019s asking constantly if I\u2019m going to do what I say, asking where I am and who I\u2019m with. The usual.\n\nDutch courage makes me want to stay out. Tell her to leave me alone. Ignore the threats of her coming to collect me to embarrass me.\n\nI think a good way to resolve it is to ask her to come down. She could prove she is the changed person. Share this part of me. See I\u2019m not all bad.\n\nShe does come. She storms in the bar. \n\nIn front of my staff she pulls away from my hand. \n\nStands aggressively. Calls me out.\n\nIntentionally trying to humiliate me.\n\nIn front of my staff and workmates.\n\nI storm off of course. So she apologised to them - \u201cYou just don\u2019t know what he is like to me\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the most unacceptable behaviour I\u2019ve ever been subjected to or seen. I can\u2019t forgive it.\n\n\nSo that\u2019s enough now. \n\nI\u2019m leaving. \n\nI\u2019ve told her.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this to her\u201d she says. \n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to live without me\u201d\n\n\n\nSo right now I\u2019m drinking heavily.\n\nI\u2019m currently led in my friends spare bed and I don\u2019t know how to tell her where I am. \n\nOr if I should tell her.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been imagining it. \n\nShe makes me feel like I am.\n\nLike I\u2019m being \u201cunreasonable\u201d and crazy again.\n\nBut I\u2019m better than this. \n\nI know I\u2019m **ready** to start again and to live my life for me.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nBut what do I do next?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I never thought there was any place to vent or to be understood. Well... here's my story I guess. \n\nI had talked to him in college, right after i got in. I made the first move. We had hit it off and we were FWB for about 6 months. We argued a lot. I was too strong willed. He was too unwilling to compromise. I fell, he didn't.  We separated for like 3 years. No contact. Nothing. \n\nThen he was \"deleting old messages on facebook\" (really though, who actually does that?) And he came across a message that I had sent 6 months prior asking if he wanted to meet up. He said sure and off we went. Things were pretty good for a bit. Then when it came to arguing, he'd have to be right. I wasn't allowed to be. I started apologizing for not seeing his point. I started alienating myself to be with him. He was all I could see in my world.\n\nHe kept saying that for me to ever be a wife to him I needed to clean (but wasn't allowed to touch his things), that I needed to help remodel HIS house, of which I had no rights to (but I wasn't allowed to do anything), that I had to cook and make his life simple and easy (when he would literally start arguements over anything).\n\nHe always told me, from the start of our relationship that he wanted me to be pleasured. That he wanted me to sleep with other men. For most women they would jump on it, but I am extremely loyal. I don't stray. But I'd say no, 2 weeks, 3, later he'd ask again. And again. Finally I said yes. It was the worst thing in my life. I felt dirty. He was so excited. He was happy I could do that \"for me\". Even if he never says it, it was for him. He used to tell me that it would help my depression. Help my mental state. All it did was hurt me. \n\nThen we were ready to break up. He had said he needed some time alone at his house, so I went to my moms. I wanted to talk things out with him and there was my, at the time, best friend who was female. I snapped. I hit him. Im not going to lie about it or make myself out to see great. I was hurt. Demolished. because just weeks before he had said how he found her attractive and how he'd fuck her if he got a chance. He left me. And I begged. Literally begged, hands and knees for him not to leave me. This was a year and a half into the relationship.\n\nHe started seeing her and I would tell him how she's going to fuck him over because she was having sex with other people on the side. He came back eventually. I didn't trust him around my friends anymore. So I isolated more. But it was always a time-frame of when I'd be okay again. 6 months. 6 months to build trust back while he continued to be on tindr, albeit at my request since he had said he wanted a poly relationship. \n\nThen he started asking me if I'd get pregnant with another man's child for him. Yes. You read that correctly. He wanted another mans child because he had/has PTSD from his ex who told seth her kid was his for 4 years. He wouldn't let it go. He would always bring it up. \n\nFinally 3 years into the relationship, I took my gun, fully intent on killing myself. My best friend, one that he called \"toxic\" to me, and played like that was his best friend any other time, answered his phone. I went to his house and cried. Just lost every bit of myself. My friend took my gun and kept it. Mind you, the Narc was in the house with me when I took my gun, in the next room. He heard the drawer. He knew my gun was in there. He'll tell you he didn't. He says to this day, my attempt was fake. It was to hurt him. It wasn't real. That I'm childish.\n\nI left 6 months later. He started seeing someone after 2 weeks. He expected me to beg. To cry and want him back. But every time he told me I was stupid, that I wasn't \"worth his time\", that I'm a \"horrible human being\" or that I'm \"not capable of being a decent person\" it made me love him less. \n\nEDIT: removed names", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

No matter what my sister or I say to her, it's met with vile comments.\n\nI've contimplated cutting her out for a long time. The help guides I read and the help.ive talked to suggested it. It was a toxic relationship. As of today I officially decided to cut the cord and step away from that relationship. I just simple sent her this via text:\n\nHey Mom, \nIt\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve talked. I\u2019m not texting you to chew you out or attack you. To be honest, this text is more of a final note between us. \nI\u2019ve come to a point in my life where I\u2019m ready to move on. I\u2019m ready to stop being angry and I\u2019m ready to start building a new life for myself. In order to do this, I need to cut a cord. \nSince this all began, it\u2019s been a struggle to cope. I\u2019ve been trying to hold on to the idea that things could get better for us, but I\u2019ve had to come to the realization it can\u2019t. I\u2019ve been so angry at you and have wanted to hold this grudge but frankly, what good is it doing? I\u2019m exhausted from this suffocating feeling. During my lowest points, I\u2019ve come to some realizations about myself and I have this journey to thank for it. I\u2019ve learned how to become a stronger person. I\u2019ve learned to get up when I\u2019ve been kicked down. I\u2019ve learned who I want to be and who I don\u2019t. I learned what love and family really means. I\u2019ve learned that being emotional is ok and it\u2019s healthy to express those feelings that you\u2019ve tried to burry inside. Most importantly, I learned who I am. \nIt\u2019s time for me to stop letting the hurt and anger control me. It\u2019s time for me to stop putting myself in situations that will never allow me the ability to get healthy. \nI\u2019ve gone back and forth on this but sometimes the best thing to do is let go. \nI want to wish you all the best in the future. Perhaps we might see each other again in the distant future. \n\n\nI just wanted to say something for closure. I blocked her number so she couldn't get ahold of me. \nWe haven't had a relationship in years. I'd hear from her every few months and when we saw each other she'd be at my throat about something. \nI felt relieved. A weight lifted off my shoulders...until my sister started telling me I did the wrong thing. \nShe started drilling into me how I can't cut out family and Im just \"hurting her\". It was the complete opposite of what we talked about a day prior. She was having a breakdown be of horrible things my mom said and was thinking about cutting out my mom as well. \n\nI feel so conflicted. Did I do the right thing?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I don\u2019t want to tell anyone despite the majority of my friends knowing, I\u2019ve always been the bane of her existence. Especially after my father died. People say that she might be depressed or messed up but it is no excuse. She acts like I\u2019m the bad guy when I try not to be constantly. I\u2019m so terrified of even having her around friends. I\u2019m 17 and she treats me like a child. She has anger issues and seems to get off on the idea of me upset. I\u2019ve been kicked out several times in my lifetime over simple stuff, we have gotten into physical fights over the stupidest things. Over a cellphone, Fake news topics, my friends, and even things like medicine. She easily blows up and constantly screams at me while calling me names. I feel selfish for even posting something like this but I need to know I\u2019m not overreacting. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019m starting to put myself down over what she thinks is wrong with me. Our most recent fight was about the fake news and in this entire fight she told me I wasn\u2019t wanted. I remember how she screamed in my face and I hauled ass out the door with my little sister. I wasn\u2019t planning on going back but I had to. I packed everything for us including blankets since I didn\u2019t know where we would be sleeping. We walked around a mile before my friends picked me up. My mother didn\u2019t speak to me for two weeks while I resided at my grandparents. I\u2019m scared of what I\u2019ll do when they are gone. I\u2019m 17 but it\u2019s still terrifying to come to somebody who tells you that you are a waste of space and you are nothing of interest. Yeah, I love her sometimes but I\u2019m always reminded of bad memories when I\u2019m with her. Most of the time I\u2019m too scared to talk around her from the fear of yelling. All I do now is apologize and even that annoys her. I do want to fix this because I can\u2019t take it anymore. Just today she called me dumb over a simple thing like clogging the toilet. She screamed at me for bringing home a mouse which I would\u2019ve fed to my pet but it was too big. She\u2019s been freaking out on me and I\u2019m contemplating giving the thing away just to avoid the screaming. We\u2019ve only had a couple of physical fights which weren\u2019t more than a shove but the words still sting. I\u2019m sorry if this isn\u2019t exactly appropriate for this area.

My mom is emotionally abusive, it took a long time for me to figure out that the way she treated me wasn't normal, but I still feel helpless. We fight all the time, not just normal fights. They can blow up and become these huge cycles of just toxicity, triggered by something minor. My mom is 98% of the time the one who starts a fight and then it spirals out of control from one topic then another and then she digs into the past etc etc, it's so bad I can't even remember it all at the end, I'm just tired and helpless. When I was in elementary school we fought too. She bothered me about my weight and told me I was fat but never tried to help guide me or tell me what to do, especially since I was too young to understand how to fix it. She would put me down when we fought, shattered my self esteem and made me hate myself. She blamed me for a lot of her failed relationships when I was younger, saying I was a devil child, even though I barely knew right from wrong at such a young age I can barely even remember that far back. She even blamed me after her and my younger brothers father separated,(when I was 6 years old) told me I was the reason they started having issues. Basically saying I'm the reason my little brother only sees his dad once or twice a year. I can't tell her anything personal whatsoever because if I do she takes that information and then uses it against me when we fight and makes me feel terrible about myself. When I was in grade 10 and found out I was bisexual I kept it from my mom, for obvious reasons. One night we were fighting and she yelled \"are you gay!?\" Out of nowhere, I said no, she asked again, I said no, \"well I saw shit in your computer\" she said. Turns out she went through my computer and found some messages between my friends. I was trying not to cry and I yelled at her that I was Bi and there was a difference. She then did a 180\u00b0 and was like \"you can tell me things, why didn't you tell me\" blah blah and proceeded to hug me and comfort me while I bawled my eyes out. Then less than a week later during a fight she called me a \"bisexual whore\"... Great right. My mom is also physical with me if fights get bad. Like she doesn't leave marks or anything but she'll punch me in the shoulder or slap me in the face, she's thrown things at me too, and on occasion kicked me. she although did leave a small circular scar on my arm from years ago when she grabbed my arm and squeezed so hard that her nail just dug into my skin. We fight to this day. I'm not saying I'm the perfect kid or anything, I'm almost 17 now and yeah I'm a jerk to her a lot, but that's because I have no respect for her anymore. I am overweight at this point, I never lost it, I really have started trying now but it's extremely difficult because I'd rather do nothing and lay in bed and sleep my problems away because I don't want to deal with her honestly.  But I really am trying to lose that weight and I'm trying to have more confidence in myself. But things with my mom are still terrible. I have zero self esteem now, and dealing with her on a daily basis is draining and I don't know how to fix this, I can't confront her because it'll start a huge fight like you wouldn't believe. I can't even try and get help for my mental problems I have now because I'd have to tell her about it and that alone terrifies me. I'm sorry this is so long. If anyone has advice that'd be great. If anyone has questions I'll be sure to answer them. It felt kinda good getting this off my chest.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

The initial argument was about the engagement ring he gave me.   \n\n\nHe never proposed, just gave it to me on my birthday saying do whatever you want with it, I don't care if you sell it (the rest of that story is long and fucked up and I wrote it somewhere else on reddit). I understood it as a birthday gift and not an engagement ring anymore, since he never gave me a birthday gift and had said he didn't want to propose to me anymore.  \n\n\nI should have let him go and not talked to him again after that. I'm only partially glad I continued to talk to him. The past several months he has always seemed to know where I am. If I was going to the store, I had to tell him what stores and why and what I was going to get there. I had to call him and show him via video where I was just in case I was lying. If I wasn't with him at his place, I had to be on video call with him for hours upon hours a day. He knew things about people I couldn't remember if I told him or not. He suddenly became completely okay with some guys he use to hate and suddenly hated people in my life I barely talked about. I wasn't allowed to hangout with anyone anymore. I wasn't allowed to go drinking. All my friends were bad in some way or another. He didn't even like that I was going to an outreach program and made me stop going in the middle of May.  \n\n\nAlmost a week ago now, I found out when I had gone to therapy months ago, he had gone through my computer and taken all of my passwords and was reading all of my messages and everything else and had been for months. Hence how he knew what I was doing. I think he also did something to the phone he bought me. So he basically knew where I was and what I was doing, even when we were broken up for almost a month during the spring.  \n\n\nA few days ago, when the massive fight happened, he kept triggering and provoking me about the ring and how horrible I was to not like it and what a greedy disgusting fuck I am for wanting an expensive engagement ring (he says the ring cost 150\u20ac but it looks like it was 40\u20ac, there is no diamonds, just chips of glass and prongs). I reminded him again that he threw the ring at me a month before he even gave it to me (who throws engagement rings at the person they are going to propose to?). I had said it looked like a nice ring but wasn't an engagement ring. He BLEW up. I said some tacky things, I'll admit. I said he could've saved for a ring instead of buying an expensive TV and his weed etc. and I had just given him 80\u20ac a few weeks before he even gave me the ring. I said he was probably fucked out of his mind on all of my meds I left there (I take adhd meds) and other drugs I knew he had there (he has a bunch of drugs there and I knew he was on something). He called me every name in the book. A lying cheating whore (because I had gotten with someone when we were broken up and he found out through messages). I deserved to die alone. My looks are fading. I'm nothing but an addict. I'll be alone and childless forever. He said I don't deserve to have the phone he bought me and spent all this money on for me.  \n\n\nWithin 5 minutes, he called the phone providers and turned off my phone. I am an immigrant. I do not speak the language well and I do not know what resources I have and I have no family here. He left me no way for the government to contact me, my doctors, my therapist, my outreach and my friends in other countries. I have literally zero friends here and the people I do know have all sided with him. I have no way to get help.  \n\n\nI contacted the only person I knew how to contact by messenger, which is the guy I was seeing when we were broken up for a short period of time. He's a really good guy. He came and picked me up, helped me understand how to get a phone in this country and I used up all of my savings to get a phone. The only good I can see is he no longer has my number and can't call me.  \n\n\nI haven't contacted him in a few days. I've been trying to get into contact with the government, doctors, my therapist and outreach people to give them my phone number and update them telling them I've basically been abused, stalked and emotionally blackmailed and had to change my number.  \n\n\nThis morning he sent me a message itemizing every single thing of mine he had taken and put in boxes, including my meds (I was wrong saying he stole them). He said this was all my fault and he spent all this money on me and my phone and food and my addictions (I don't know why he keeps calling me an addict?). He refuses to pay for me anymore so I need to send him 75\u20ac so he can ship the box to me.   \n\n\nThe only solace I have is looking at my bank account. I saw that in the past 2 years we were together, I gave him 500\u20ac of my own money, I have paid for his gas and groceries numerous times, I spent upwards of 2000+ on bus tickets and taxis to get to his place and to mine. I have given him my card more times than I can count that he knows my pin number by heart and I have never used his card once.  \n\n\nI feel so awful. My whole body hurts. I keep trying to stay strong but keep having suicidal thoughts and just want to give up. I just don't want to try anymore. If I'm this awful of a person, why bother.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We have a 6 year old, 3 year old and 3 month old . I\u2019m 30 , he is 29.  He has been in and out of jail for the past 2 years due to petty crime which he commits whilst being high on ice (meth) and heroin (he smokes both of these ) . I had no idea about his heroin addiction or drug use until after our now 3 year old son was born.  I don\u2019t know how I was so blinded by everything, maybe working full time, and taking care of 2 small children stopped me from noticing his habits.  Once I found out about his addiction our life spiralled  out of control. He was gambling all of our money , cheating with junkies , not coming home for days on end. He became abusive to me both physically and mentally. I moved with the kids to a new house with my mum, he continued to go on binges and go missing. I don\u2019t know why I decided to give him a second chance , he moved back in.  He always blames me for all of our problems . I\u2019m being to bossy , he should not have to listen to me because he is a grown man. He says I\u2019m the reason he is in jail??? He accuses me of cheating, stealing \u201chis money\u201d , he says he does not trust me. So why does he stay? I\u2019ve asked him to leave numerous times as this is too much for me. He is currently in jail , he gets out after 9months this coming Monday. I\u2019m a nervous wreck. I don\u2019t want my kids to deal with this mental abuse any longer, he was so kind to me the whole 9 months he was inside now the abuse has started again seeings he comes out in less then a week. I want to leave, but I feel like am I over reacting , maybe that\u2019s the way he has made me feel over all these years ?....the two older  kids love their father   very much as I do not mention how much of a bad person he is to me and tell them to love their father .  but I know they see it when we argue. I don\u2019t want my kids to turn out like him. No empathy, or concern for how others feel. He says he loves his children . But is that possible for a narcissist?

It was intense, it started when I wasn\u2019t even 18. It was a very difficult time for me. It seemed good but he slowly started blaming me for more and more things. I was dealing with a lot of difficult personal issues (my cheating father, my mother's cancer) and he would make me feel bad for them. He also cheated on me, made no efforts to hide it, but would still gaslight me? Occasionally beat me. Kept breaking up with me but nothing would change. Then blamed me for the fact that we never really break up. Sometimes he would be really supportive and there for me, but sometimes he was really mean and would get pissed off when things got to me. Looking back i wished he would have really broken up with me and let me go because I was too needy and weak to ever stand up for myself and do it.\n\nWe slowly drifted apart over the last couple of years and despite everything I really do not feel resentful or wish him anything bad. But I left with a real paranoia of being hurt and manipulated. I read into everything - negatively - and **I have no bearings on real affection anymore**. And trust, I have real issues with trusting people now and it really brings me down because I\u2019m so scared of being treated like shit. I\u2019ve become even more protective of myself. This has stopped me in engaging in anything meaningful until now.\n\nI've been friends with this guy for a long long time and started getting more affectionate recently but he was still in his relationship which has only just ended and this has been difficult for me, especially because he\u2019s occasionally been sneaky about it.

I don't want to sound like I'm being self centered  (I was accused of that in her rant) but I struggle to empathize with her when she fly's of the handle like she did the other day. \n\nI also suffer form anxiety, (she knows about this). As so try and avoid, by physically removing myself from, confrontational situations. So the following exchange happened, and I'll try and be brief. \n\nI was staying with my parents. An argument was forming about my wedding (my parents, while offering to stump up a large sum of money, were questioning every decision I've made so far to the point where, because I picked a small venue for the ceremony, there are more of there friends attending than mine). I said i was willing to pay for one of my best friends, who lives in Australia (i'm uk) and has falling on some hard times, to fly out for the wedding. \n\nMy parents did not like this. I said I wouldn't use 'there money' to do this.... My dad said if i was using 'my' money for that why did they have to put so much in? Followed quickly by 'How much are OH parents putting in'....they also did not like that answer. Que me trying to justify why my friend is import important enough to have at my wedding...my mother then decides to say that my best friend is scamming me to get a holiday to the UK.... (i'm very upset by this) also my dad is claiming he doesn't want some 'stranger' at the wedding.... somewhere in this conversation, my mother walks out of the room saying i'm being very rude.....\n\nI often am rude, and loud and use bad language...now on this occasion, I was actually holding it together. However that really broke me....so I tired to leave the house. I could feel this was only going one way and that was towards me having a panic attack. \n\nNow this is where it gets relay bad....so my mother then starts screaming, about well everything....that i'm a terrible daughter...how dare i leave when she has cancer....lots of screaming of i'm dying over and over...that i never call, that i didn't even send her flowers\n\n( This is true I didn't. However she is very fussy about flowers and I was actually taking with me a plant she had been given that she didn't like....so ye i don't buy her flowers!)\n\n Why didn't i visit more...i see more of my OH family than of them....why haven't they sent her a card...why does everyone else come before them...I was supposed to see them for Sunday lunch but 'chose' to work instead.\n\n (The lunch was actually something they had arranged with another friend and I was added later)\n\n Why didn't i care she was dying... What if they needed the money for her treatment...I'm only working part time so what if they needed to borrow money from me (at this my dad did point out that they would never have to do that as they have some properties they could sell...they are quite well off and i don't think have ever relay forgiven me for not 'making it'.) There was quite a lot about my OH who they like, but why doesn't he come and visit....I've clearly made him think they are terrible people....what are you going to tell him... I don't even bring a bottle of wine when i come and visit and this is relay disrespectful. Every time i do come and visit its for another reason...I clear don't care about them and are cold towards them and take them for granted.  \n\nI sort of loose track after that because, well I had a panic attack. to which her response was...i see your doing your fainting thing now. \n\nNow obviously I couldn't actually leave at this point. I was only just about functional to drive the next day.\n\nEventually when she had stopped....she insisted we talk. Now this was my opportunity to remind her, that yes I have a mental health condition. I was trying to leave to stop a panic attack. She then went on to say that she forgets that i'm not as strong as her...that's why she worry's that people will take advantage of me. That she doesn't know why i'm not a strong personalty like her. That I'm welcome to come and stay at the house to relax. That i don't need to bring my OH if he's busy. That she just wants me to be happy . \n\nMy dad also reiterates this the next day by quoting that ' you are only as happy as your unhappiest child'. \n\nBut this is not the first time she has completely lost her shit. The last time it happened it was much worse and she was physically violent. She explains that that was also because of the circumstances she was under, my brother had died. \n\nThe time before that my brother was in hospital. She only pored water on me and kicked me out of where we were staying. \n\n Other than these times where she just completely losses it, she is probably a normal mother. She has opinions on my hair, clothing and other parts of my life of course. But she wants to take me out shopping, will happily buy me things. Will happily buy things for my other best friend (who i have known since childhood) and her daughter. So my folks aren't mean. \n\nI will say that I know i get preoccupied with my own life. I'm not doing anything deliberately to hurt them and I though I was calling enough and checking up on her and her treatment... I probably should have done more and I feel terrible about that. I'm scaling back my wedding plans so its not as expensive and i'm hoping that will help with some of there worry. But my dad is insisting on giving me the money anyway as 'its not about the money'. (??) \n\nBUT the question in my mind is....is this what emotional abuses looks likes? Is it something else? Dose she also have some sort of emotional disorder? Is this just stress? \n\nUsing me as a punching bag because of her stress is how it feels....but is that fare? \n\nHelp me figure this out.....I want a good relationship with my parents. I want to see them more if it will help her...but i'm not sure a bunch of flowers could possible fix this....", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I knew he was just projecting his insecurities on me and my gut told me this was a major red flag. Good thing I had the presence of mind to collect hard evidence of these correspondences just in case.\n\nAnyway, what bothers me now is that he\u2019s playing the victim card to his flying monkeys and totally flipping the script. I have a feeling he\u2019s leaving out the parts in the narrative where I brought up our issues constructively, or how I handled certain things in our relationship in a respectful manner. I feel like he will highlight our arguments based on a projection of his own insecurities - he\u2019ll be framing the story to make him look like the one who was in agony, when in fact I was being abused in his vicious cycle of narcissism. A part of me wants to expose him with all the hard evidence I have amassed over the year we were together. But then again, if he\u2019s playing the victim and launching a smear campaign (hopefully not), I would just fit his accusation of being the crazy ex or \u201cmean\u201d person, which I think he is already painting me as to his new \u201cfriends.\u201d I\u2019m bothered by this and I feel compelled to do something about it - clear my name, defend myself, show proof that he\u2019s the abusive one - but all the advice of support resources and therapists say otherwise. I would appreciate your thoughts on this as well. How do I react and what can I do to address how I\u2019m feeling? Thanks in advance.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I told her again, how absolutely stupid I feel, so duped.  I am a smart woman, I had a brilliant and successful career (before I moved across the country to be with him), and I find myself to be an emotionally intelligent being.  So learning just how deep the lying has gone, how I was abused, his wife, family, colleagues, friends.  \n\nSo, in therapy yesterday, saying just how absolutely stupid I feel, she shared this saying with me.  \"The virtuous are not schooled in deceit.\"  \n\nI think it's a great saying for all of the people who haven't been a victim of this kind of person before, and who don't look to harm or deceive others.

{"post_id": "ckds2l", "created_utc": 1564604093, "title": "A cycle of not knowing or accepting", "author": "Gitfiddle24", "self_text": "VERY LONG POST\n\nHi,\n\nI'm going to list some instances and am wondering if anyone thinks there is a probability that I was abused or if anyone has experienced similar things. I have no memory of anything happening but after being in therapy for over a year and a half and thinking of this on a daily basis for the past 4 or so years I'm starting to feel tired.\n\nInstance 1: when I was a child, no older than six, I remember my cousin and me were kissing in an innocent manner -- quick peck on the cheek or lips. But one time I tried to shove my tongue in her mouth and make it sexual. I dont remember ever learning this from anything, but that seemed to be a natural impulse at the time. I'm a bit confused where I would have learned this from.\n\nInstance 2: when I was in the second grade I remember trying to coerce my toddler cousin into kissing me (she didn't) and having pretty intense sexual feelings toward her, all while having an erection at the moment. It's strange because it seemed as if I wasn't fully aware of what I was doing. It was just happening. \n\nInstance 3: there was a large period of time in elementary school where I felt intense shame and hatred after masturbating to the point where I would cut myself.\n\nInstance 4: when I was thirteen I remember being in a pool with the same little cousin and trying to grab her butt, again it seemed as if I had no awareness of what I was doing, as if something just took over. I never took anything further because she was asking me to stop and I felt gross for doing so. \n\nInstance 5: I ate psilocybin mushrooms when I was 16, had a terrible experience, experienced an ego death and at the height of the ego death my voice was telling me that something did happen to me and at that moment I was crying really hard. I remember during the trip trying to deny those thoughts but they continually came back and stronger until it finally came out. \n\nMore recently within the past year I've had a lot of intense dreams of being raped, not only rape but other forced sexual acts. \n\nThere are many more instances of odd sexual behavior as a child to my early teens and a very long history of intense guilt, shame, and anger.\n\nAs for my cousin, she has grown up normally as far as I can tell. I feel DISGUSTING thinking about my past actions, and I really want to talk to her about them so if there is anything going on internally she can be helped. \n\nAlso: my brother had a long history of drug abuse but got sober after admitting he was molested by our older cousin (at one point we lived in the house, but not with the abuser) \n\nI wasn't sure where to put this post, so please redirect me if it does not belong.\n\nIf anyone wants to know more, please PM me. All viewpoints are/will be considered.\n\nI thank anyone who has read this with every bit of me. \n\nUn'abbraccio forte!", "subreddit": "abuse"}

After struggling for so long, I've gotten to a point where I can feel myself moving on and memories between me and him have lost a lot of their power over me. He feels like a surreal dream and when I think about him, I have a difficult time imagining that I was ever with him, because it feels that distant. I also feel like I've gained a lot of my sense of self back, which took a long time, and I didn't think it would ever happen. But it did and I'm grateful that it's becoming stronger each day.\n\nYet, there are still issues I still struggle with that I have a difficult time getting past. Like comparing myself to the other women, along with the guilt from the situations that were caused because of him when triangulating me with them. I'm not sure how to reconcile those thoughts in my mind and to stop hurting from them. The comparing is one thing, but the guilt affects me so much more. There are two specific women that he triangulated me with that were hurt in the process and I felt like such a pawn, because he played on my feelings for him and got me involved. The first one was such a messy situation. While trying to be with me, he was also using her, and I didn't know. And then the other woman and I got into contact, while still being stuck in a complicated and weird situation with him, thereby causing hurt feelings between me and her over him. I should have cut ties with him at that point, but I didn't. He always found a way to get back into my life and I let him in.\n\nAs for the second one, he left me for her. I found out about her because he was acting distant and I did some digging.  I messaged her and told her what was going on, that he was with me and I had a feeling something was happening. Told her about who he was and what he does. She told me she had only been seeing him for like a week and thanked me for the message, but then said she needed to hear his side. Well she did, and then blocked me. She then proceeded to move in with him after 2 weeks of knowing him. I went NC for months, constantly ignoring and avoiding any contact he tried. When he left me, I was so broken and hurt, yet I tried to stay away whenever he would try to come back in my life despite being with her. He used different numbers and different ways to contact me, till I finally broke. I was in a really low point and I wanted that hit from him, so I responded. He cheated on her with me (never anything physical, just talking) and all I could think about was what a shitty, horrible person I was. She didn't deserve this and I never wanted to hurt her, ever. I was so fucking addicted to him and after having been with him for such a long time and him isolating me, he became what I saw as my lifeline when in reality, he was the weight dragging me down and drowning me. It fucked with my mind because not only did I have this intense emotional tie to him, but I also broke my own moral code for him. I had become the other woman. \n\nHe was trying to leave her and wanted her to move out, so the day he broke up with her, she also found out about me (he set it up and created a chaotic mess like he did other times) and she was hurt. I never thought I'd ever become the other woman, but I did and I can't let that guilt go.  Every day that I was talking to him, all I could feel is a deep sadness and guilt because of what was happening, yet I wanted to talk to him and wanted his comfort and wanted all his sweet lies. And man, he has a silver tongue and always knew what to say. \n\nWhen she found out, she messaged me on instagram after unblocking me. We talked over instagram video chat while he was there in the room (never saw her face, just heard her voice) and of course she was very upset and hurt. Honestly, all of it was a blur and I couldn't do anything but hate myself for allowing myself to be in this situation and be a reason another person got hurt. She attacked me a few times, yelled at him, told me how could I do that as a woman, and then proceeded to demand that I send her messages between me and him as proof. I never did, because after that happened, I blocked her and him. After talking to a couple friends, they told me they thought I shouldn't send screenshots because it only drags me further into the drama and that she has more than enough proof because of the messages and pics I sent her way back when I found out about her as the other woman when he left me. \n\nI still wonder sometimes if I should have sent her screenshots of the messages between me and him. And I still feel so guilty about the situation. I wonder sometimes if I should unblock her and properly apologize and explain to her what happened. She has since moved on with her life and I don't want to just pop up out of the blue. And it's dumb, but a part of me wants to get to know her so I can see her as a real human being, instead of the pedestal I put her on just because she was someone my ex left me for. For some reason, every girl that my nex has triangulated and cheated on me with immediately gets put on a pedestal and I view them as better than me just because my mind sees it as a reason for why my nex did what he did to me. \n\nAnd then that leads to one final thing that I'm struggling with that's connected to the comparing. All the other women he's been with have just moved on. Granted, they all weren't with him very long. Only a month to a few months at the most. So maybe that makes it easier to let it go and move forward. He was with me in an official relationship for a year and a half and then we had a weird thing for another year and a half. So three years in total dealing with his bullshit and more than enough time to get myself ridiculously addicted. I feel envious of how easy it was for them to just get over it, get into other relationships, do other things with their life, while I  still struggle with trying to regain my sense of self and getting my life back. Of course everything I'm seeing is on social media, so I don't know the real truths behind the pictures. I also care too much about what they think about me, like whether they view me as a pathetic, weak-willed individual or a horrible person. I also wonder if they've ever compared their selves to me like I have to them. \n\nHave any of you been the other woman? If so, did you have guilt and how did you deal with it? \n\nDo any of you struggle with envy of seeing the other people your narcs have been with move on so easily? \n\nHow do you handle your comparing?
