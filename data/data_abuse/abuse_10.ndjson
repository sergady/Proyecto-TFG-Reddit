BIG CHANGE after this incident- loving, flowers, seemingly real kindness.. trapped in this cycle and don't know if I'm paranoid and seeing \"love bomb\" instead of real effort to be nice?? \n\n\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been together for 2.5 years, and I'm having a panic at work today after reading everything on this sub. Things started intense, amazing, and very quickly dissolved. The first time he blew up was about 6 months in, when I asked for more foreplay. I was shamed, told I was simultaneously crazy (because there WAS foreplay, why am I saying there isn't??) and demanding (because there isn't foreplay but THERE DOESN'T NEED TO BE so how dare I pester him). \n\nShortly after this blowup he started withholding sex and physical affection, replacing cuddles with incessant tickling, poking, and putting things up close in my face. \n\nThis went on for a while until I started to get aggravated, and we had a long period of fighting. I thought it was about the lack of sex so we fought a lot about that, he told me I was too fat, I'd let myself go, too skinny, too flirty at parties, then bemoaned the fact that everyone used to look at me when I walked in and why wasn't I flirty and fun anymore. \n\nThe fighting escalated, and he started stonewalling me. Literally pretending I didn't exist for hours. One night we'd been drinking, and he stopped in the middle of a sentence and just stared at the TV. He proceeded to ignore me for the next hour, until I was hysterical. I was so confused, and so angry. I hit him in a desperate attempt to make him acknowledge I was even there. That started the 'you're abusive' line of dismissing me. \n\nTwo months later, he strangled me on five separate occasions. Two he says he did because I was hysterical and he couldn't risk me hitting him again. I am, after all, abusive. The rest he says he can't remember, but remembers exactly what I did wrong those nights that would have warranted him doing it, if he had. \n\nThis year, he beat me up. He punched me in the face repeatedly after I got frustrated with him promising to be intimate after a date night and instead turning on the TV. My eye was swollen shut for days. \n\nNow, he says he's working on it. Regrets everything, please stay to work this out. But he hasn't met more than twice with the domestic abuse program people, and everything just seems... Superficial. The last week was like heaven, he was so attentive and kind and lovey with me, and now this week.. back to poking. I'm so scared it just goes back downhill from here. This is the cycle, isn't it? I can't see it clearly and I don't know why, it's all right there. \n\nUgh. Help.\n\nEdit: I came home so sad and aggravated.. just burst into tears when I got in the door. I told him I 100% believe it's going to happen again, and that I'm horrified I've been just plugging along on the assumption that I'm going to be beaten again someday. He just told me he isn't going to hit me and he's trying to build my trust again... I didn't have the guts to say I'm still seeing the other abuse, the poking, the dismissing, the constant little \"joking\" put downs. I feel like I'm taking everything too seriously, like I'm traumatized and seeing abuse where it isn't. He's being so kind. Am I insane?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I bought my roof rack and single j-hook (to carry the kayak) last summer, 2018. Not a cheap purchase. $1k total. The j-hook was $150 for ONE. CNex purchased his roof rack this summer, and we were together when we decided to purchase a single j-hook each. Both $150 a piece. He paid for his, and I paid for my own. This would be my second hook so that I could carry two kayaks, and he didn't feel the need to get a second since we agree we could simply pop mine off my rack and put it onto his. You should also know, the man is very frugal. Very. So for him to purchase the j-hook, was a stretch for him (no judgment).\n\nFast forward....\n\nHis covert narcissistic behavior got out of control with the emotional abuse; and sexual aggression started coming into play, so I finally ended it 4 weeks ago. I was kind when I ended it. Very. I didn't blame him for anything, there's no point. He wouldn't be able to see his part, and couldn't, no matter how hard I tried to get him to see how poorly he treated me, nothing worked. I simply ended it over the phone with saying \"I am not a good fit for you anymore.\" He didn't disagree, in fact, he didn't say anything to that at all. It ended with us both saying goodbye mutually, He followed up with four apology texts stating he simply cannot meet my needs. After reviewing the apologies with my therapist, as well as the relationship itself, she is the one who brought to my attention that he was completely a covert narcissist and very manipulative. Ugh.\n\nThe following day I went to his house and removed some large important belongings (kayaks, paddles, pfd's, chairs) from his garage. I did have the code and I did call to tell him I was going to be there. I even text him to let him know I was there and that I was NOT going into the house, as I didn't think it was an appropriate boundary to cross at that point. I never heard from him, as he LOVED, and I mean LOVED to give the silent treatment. He also had horrible avoidant behavior (coward).\n\nAfter I text him to let him know I was at the house and listed everything I was taking that belonged to me (I even listed quantities), I proceeded to set a finial boundary for myself by asking him to please keep the items that I left in the house (cheap air mattresses, cheap small tent and a few misc cooking utensils). I asked him to please keep any gifts I had given him, and that I wanted NOTHING back, especially the items I had listed (camping gear that was cheap). I also, very kindly, let him know that I left his belongings in the garage as well. And then I blocked him EVERYWHERE. I had intentionally asked him NOT to give me back anything, and I was very specific with listing out those items. He didn't respect my boundary (as usual), and that evening hovered me.\n\nA week later I went into my storage unit to get my garbage bin for the garbagemen, and I look down and found that he had left those items I specifically did NOT want back. He disrespected my boundary. But that's not all. He was so covert / strange about it. Here's how:\n\nHe purchases a brand new plastic bin placing those items inside. He took the time to package everything up nicely in ziplock bags. He also GIFTED me a coffee grinder that was his ensuring it was perfectly cleaned out, looking like new, and had that packaged up in a plastic bag as well. Strange.\n\nThen! He returned a sound-bar for his TV I had given him. I had upgraded mine, and decided to give him my old one, because he needed it. Thing about that is, he totally FORGOT to bring back the subwoofer that went with it. I had just given it to him, and the last I saw it, the two were sitting on the floor next to each other. The subwoofer was not a tiny thing. I was annoyed with all of this and simply threw EVERYTHING away. I did NOT want it. Not even the coffee grinder. I have ZERO need for it.\n\nOne week later, something was nagging at me regarding the storage unit. I kept looking in there to see if I was blind and didn't see the subwoofer. I also looked again for a note. Nothing. But then I noticed he had done something diabolical. He had taken his j-hook off his car and given it to me placing it neatly next to my second one. It was hidden in fact.\n\nI reacted in disbelief. Sickness. Why? Why would he do that? It was SO expensive. He needs it. I already have two and cannot fit a third. But why? Why would he forget the subwoofer (and hasn't returned it) and give me something I do not need. Why? I cannot make sense of it.\n\nOne week later, after my discovery. I got hovered again, and I think I know why. I happen to look out and see his car and would you believe he went out and bought another j-hook and put it on his rack? Why you guys, why? Why hoover? Why do this? What was he thinking? Why does he want to hurt me like this? Why would he do something so senseless?\n\nI have NOT given him a response. I'm not even itching too. It's sad to me that people can treat others so mean.\n\nI just don't get it.\n\nThank you!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was friends with him for nearly five years and I loved him. \n\nIn the end, he hated my family, my job, my profession, my education, and my identity.

Everything was always someone else's fault (usually mine), and she worked me to death. I almost lost my marriage and did lose many friends over her simply taking over my life. I only got paid to work 8 hours a day - but she would text me at all hours of the day...4am, midnight, whenever she had a problem I needed to solve. If I wasn't in communication with her - I still felt a sense of dread and anxiety all day. If I took time for myself/my family and didn't answer her text...my stomach would hurt with pangs of guilt until I finally gave in and just worked without pay to make her happy. It was a rough situation because I'm a hard worker, a problem-solver, and a people-pleaser. So it was super easy for her to guilt me into doing what she wanted at all hours of the day and sticking around for years just to be thrown under the bus and treated like garbage daily. \n\n6 months ago - I finally got out. I have a new job now and it's amazing - my new boss is the exact opposite of my former boss. Whatever the opposite of a narcissist is...that's him. And I've spent the last 6 months basically retraining my brain. I was previously in long-term relationship with and lived with a narcissist...and I compare my exit of that job and entering my new job to my breakup with the narcissist and then getting into a relationship with my now husband (who is also the opposite of a narcissist). It's like...I didn't know what to do with myself when I was being treated well. Feeling guilty for being treated well almost...like my mind just kept going back to what it was like in my old job. I would constantly think \"I wish my old boss could see me with my new boss - having a blast and not being treated like shit\" which is exactly what I would think when I was out with my new man after the narc left me. But the fact is - all of my focus was still on my old boss and what she was thinking/feeling or how she would react to me being in a better place now. \n\nSo, just like I had to rid by brain of the constant thought about \"what is he thinking/feeling/saying/doing right now\"....I had to do the same with my boss. I go to therapy regularly and this is something I've worked on with my therapist. After months - I finally got to the point where I wasn't thinking of her almost daily. So of course, I get an email from her last week. \n\nShe wants me to \"help\" with the largest annual event the org has. It's a limited duration (event is 16th of Nov) but she is \"desperate\" and \"can't do it without me\". She offered me LOTS of money - on an hourly basis to help prep for the event and the day of. I'm struggling with what to do here. Everyone in my life is like \"no no no no no no\" like....don't put yourself back in your old shoes. But of course, I need the money....and I know there's an end date. \n\nAdvice needed - is it worth the (tons of) extra money to go back for a 1.5 month long part-time stint with my old narc boss?

After months of waiting for this issue to be resolved, I had finally become suspicious enough to demand that I come with him to see for myself the various things he was doing/people he was talking to to correct the problem.

I have had about a month or two to reflect on everything and still feel the hurt honestly. I hope she isn't reading this because I need to get my side out there unfiltered. Also thank you for taking any time to read this and I hope everyone else is doing okay on this sub. I am sprry if any of you went through anything because it takes a lot of healing but everyone will come out stronger and smarter eventually. I promise.\n\nI do not want to accuse my ex of emotional abuse  but the more research I do, the more I hurt and realize what was happening in the relationship. I want nothing more than for both of us to move on and learn from the relationship no matter the lesson the other took. I learned I need someone there for us and who would never give up no matter the circumstance. I can't say what she learned; that is for her to say and decide on.\n\nSo now to the hurtful part. The part I hate to type because I loved you so much and still will never hate you. You hurt me in many ways through the relationship and especially after. I have not been perfect but I apologized and had no intention of ever hurting you. That is the difference and why i post this here. You never apologized once throughout the relationship for a fact. I feel like you also intentionally tried to hurt me through many incidents. The worst part is that I still blame myself for EVERYTHING because you conditioned me to be this way for months.\n\nI wanted honesty more than anything. Instead, you kept lying about how you felt. That hurt more than anything you else you could do. I know your heart wasn't in it. It wasn't this but the issues that arose when I kept asking. You got resentful and I got frustrated. I needed straight answers to resolve my inner conflict but you kept lying. Because of this I naturally kept asking. It was because I cared about you. I did not want you in a relationship that you didn't want. I didn't want to be in a relationship you didn't want either.\n\nSo with all the lies and conflicts, you started to just give up and hurt me. You made everything my fault for months. I have many memories of being concerned for you and how I felt and getting immensely hurt because of it. \n\nOnce your brother with anger issues got angry with you due to something. I came up to support you and make sure he didn't harm you. You then turned around and tried, with all the force you had, to push me down the stairs because of your anger towards him. I was hurt and left you alone for a little. Then, when you calmed down, I asked why. In the end, you didn't own up to the mistake. Never said sorry. You made me feel bad for not being there for you afterwards. \n\nAnother night, I had made one of the hardest transitions in my life and simply asked if you missed me due to not seeing each other for a few days. You said that it wasn't necesarily true you did. I was immensly hurt so I questioned more on your true feelings. Instead, you lost your temper and left me abandoned for a few days. You punched a door and didn't talk to me for days. You then blamed it on me texting you an emotional text that was interpreted poorly. Once again, never said sorry and blamed it on me.\n\nAnother day, I asked you how you felt because I felt like something was off. I did this multiple times throughout the summer because something felt wrong with us. I needed to know how you felt. You said stop asking or I will break up with you. So I tried to quell my emotions for you even though I am a very emotional person. I compromised myself for you when you would never do the same.\n\nYour actions always speak louder than your words. You could tell me a hundred times that you loved me as your soulmate. I wanted to believe you but your actions nor attitude never backed it up once. That is why I kept asking. I am sorry that I didn't believe you but I kept changing to make us work when you didn't want to grow or learn.\n\nI have many more examples but the three above were enough to hurt me immensely. The worst wasn't in the relationship but when it ended. You became very hurtful and intentional about what you said.\n\nThe times I hurt you were never intentional and I said and still mean it when I say I am sorry. I am sorry for once saying I couldn't live without you and that I would probably hurt myself if things ended. That was not a threat at all but just how I felt I guess when I got out of my depression to meet you. We talked about it and I promised I wouldn't do that. It also never came up again. I am sorry because this is the one moment that I still feel bad about 100% without any doubt. I felt estatic and that life wasn't the same for the best. I am glad you took the option to break up with me because it was a hard decision no matter what. \n\nI almost made that same decision. I loved you and never wanted to give up but I became emotionally starved most days. Some days, you made me believe that you cared and loved me. That was when you cared and wanted to grow. The other times (the final months), you kept making me feel just not loved and only loved me when it was requiered to you. \n\nIn the end, we didn't work out. I was going to let the pain and everything fall away with the breakup but you never let go. You had your side but wouldn't accept nor let me tell mine ever. You became very angry and resentful when I did start telling others how I felt.\n\nYou made posts on the same subreddit I was posting to so I could see it. You called me an abusive pussy and that I emotionally abused you. That term never entered my head about you or I before you said that. I felt horrible because of what you said. I never posted anything negative about you in my posts. I said that I moved on from us and you took that too far personally. \n\nYou then made more posts attacking who I am as a person and that I wasn't the things I wanted to be. You attacked my musical side which you knew means the world to me. \n\nYou made a new reddit account to comment on my posts without me knowning it was you. You made me feel horrible because I thought it was somebody else telling me. You then posted more stuff and left out mahor details just to paint me as a horrible person and get sympathy from others. \n\nThe last thing I wrote to you was, \"from the bottom of my heart, have a wonderful life please and grow from this.\" You never mentioned this. In all your posts you made me seem like the relationship meant nothing to me. You left out what really happened and it hurt immensely.\n\nI am still sorry if I hurt you in any way. But you have to accept that my life is moving on and that you did horrible things to me that cannot be undone. \n\nI never did anything intentional nor abusive towards you. You said as someone else that, \"it was just how she took it.\" Emotional abuse is intentional and extremely serious. Thats why I have issues accussing you of that. Yeah you follow a lot of abusive patterns but considering how much you telling others that I did that, I don't want to say you did yet. I still need time to ruminate on that one. That's why I wrote all of this.\n\nI am legitemately scared to post this because I don't know how it will feel with more time. I have thought a lot about what happened. I just want to be better for the next person. I gave you my everything though and sorry for the mistakes and hurt. It was never intentional. \n\nThank you for reading and commenting at all!

(sexual triggers/rape) (Rant/vent)", "author": "StreetRaven", "self_text": "I'm pretty sure I married a narc. Again. No diagnosis, just my observations.  The first one was textbook. This one, maybe just some tendencies, but enough to drive me both up the wall and into a shell at the same time.       \n\nA couple/three years ago he took advantage of me while asleep, more than once, and lied about it afterwards when I tried to call out the bullshit.  I've been trying really hard to not just end myself for most of these last few months. We still live together, and have one child together. Had we not had her, I'd have left long ago. I know, it's terrible to stay for the kids, yadda yadda, but I really have no other option right now. I've been less than employable, therapy hasn't helped. I live in a shitty area of the country where everyone is uppity and I'm a fucking idiot. \n\nThe other day, I was not feeling well, and he knew it.  He asked if there was anything he could do, and of course there isn't because silent migraines (or whatever they are) are just a waiting game. I was laying down trying to avoid too much stimulation. He wanted to lay with me.  Whatever, I just want to rest. He puts a hand in my pelvic area. I do nothing because I'm just trying to rest and he wasn't doing anything inappropriate such as stroking or whatever. Just sat his hand there. I continue trying to rest.  Readjust my body at some point, and his hand ends up on my ass. I asked him what he was doing with his hand, he's like \"what do you mean?\" \n\n\"Your hand, on my ass.\" \n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because I'm saying something about it\"\n\n(now, this is the part he disagrees with) \"What is your problem? Jesus.\"\n\nI lay there for a bit, trying to process what to do next. I decide I don't way to lay in there anymore, and get up and storm out.  As I'm shutting the door, he says \"Whatever!\" in a real sassy tone. I go to my computer chair, curl up into an upright sitting ball, and cry and try to stay calm enough to not melt down.\n\nHe gets pissy, decides now is a good time to do laundry. Refuses to get a bank card out of my purse because he's a child, I don't know, and demands that I get it for him. I keep asking why he now has a problem with doing something he's successfully done a hundred times before. He says he's not gonna do that anymore. \"I'm not gonna do a lot of things anymore.\" I continue to refuse to get it for him.  If he wants the laundry done so badly, he's gonna have to suck it up.  He also proclaims on the way out that he's probably gonna stay out for a while. I know this is a lie, and do not respond. I tend to shut down when people try to get attention from me like that. \n\nLo and behold, he's back quite soon, in a much more submissive mood asking what he did wrong. I went back to bed to try and sleep, maybe if he does stay out longer I can actually get some decent rest. I pretend to be asleep, maybe he will go away and let me sleep. He asks me once if I'd tell him what he did wrong.  He asks if I'm just pretending to be asleep.  He proceeds to touch my in several places, in very sexual ways. I'm trying to brush it off, still pretending to sleep. I finally \"wake up\" and ask him what he wants. I'm almost positive that had I not \"woken up\" he'd have kept going and probably raped me, again, just like he did before, years ago. \n\nI'm getting shakey just writing about this, but I need to get it out. \n\nI sat with him for a small bit to talk about it, and he absolutely refuses to admit that I got pissy directly after he touched my ass, that he only asked me what my problem was after I got up and stormed away. Is absolutely trying to gaslight me. I know what happened, and I wrote it all down as soon as he left the house. He says he really should start carrying around a tape recorder. I only said \"Do it.\"\n\nI think I just answered my own question.  It's hard to recover when you're still in the depths. \n\nI wanted to believe we could at least raise our daughter in a somewhat normal way. But this is never going to change, and it's only going to end up destroying or ending me. I'm afraid to get a job because he's done things to my other children from another marriage. Nothing sexual (that I'm aware of) but he has done things and tried to cover them up by making them promise not to tell me. All while I was away at work. I don't have money to move out, and I'm also afraid of him sabotaging any efforts I make if he knows about them.  I don't have a way to make money from home without him knowing. I don't know what to do. The car I have available to me is a total POS, but could probably be relied upon if need be.  \n\nHe's not on reddit at all, as far as I know, so I'm not really afraid of him finding this. And, well, if he does, guess I'm moving out sooner than I thought. \n\nOn top of that, I talked (couple weeks ago at this point) to a guy I used to work with who is not trying to hook up or anything, just wants to actually be platonic. It's a new concept to me, I've never been \"friend-zoned\" by a guy before. I hate the term, but it's the most appropriate. I reminded him on what happened to me a few years ago. We talked about it a bit, whatever. A day or so later, he mentions that he has great honest conversations with his friends, just making small talk. I asked what about, and apparently the conversation was about her waking up to an orgasm and rolling over and having sex. And apparently this was an okay and good thing for her. Great for her I guess? If she's alright with it, then that's her choice. I just don't want to hear about it. Being able to read a room is a rare skill, I guess. \n\nBut he can't figure out why I might have an issue with this.  So I've been avoiding talking to him because I just don't wanna go into a silent migraine panic attack fit again.\n\nSorry so long. I just wanted to get this out. It's been eating at me. Thanks for listening. I don't know who to trust for anything, and I'm feeling very alone and quite depressed.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I (25M) was with my GF (25F) and we were driving back from her brother's house after letting his dog out and spending some time with the pup. On the drive home, we wanted to plan what to have for dinner. We decided on some steaks and potatoes, but not what kind of potatoes - mashed or baked. I asked her what she preferred and she said she didn't care, so I said let's have baked.\n\nShe got upset with me and said that earlier in the day she said she wanted mashed potatoes, I guess unhappy that I didn't remember that important detail. And after that, she stayed upset with me for a while.\n\nI know, it's only \\*POTATOES\\* of all things, but it really rubbed me the wrong way and led me to some not-so-nice thoughts about myself and my self-worth.

He didn't seem to care about my feelings too much. Side note: I have bipolar disorder, PTSD, and severe anxiety. So I already struggle alot. I felt abandoned. I went on a cruise, got drunk, and slept with someone. I felt terrible. When he found out he was obviously livid. I promised it would never happen again and it hasn't. But since then he's used it as an excuse to treat me like shit, making me think he hid his true self from me from the get go. He lied about going to work, quit his job, used my car to do who knows what for months that I didn't know he was unemployed. He had us evicted and was taking my rent money and spending it on who knows what. Then I found out he had been sexting other people the entire time he was unemployed and supposedly looking for a job. He would lie about anything and everything. I even took a charge for him after I'm pretty sure he set me up for it with his lawyer. He claimed he had no clue when we went to court that it would be pinned on me. Apparently I was supposed to just be a character witness.  Anyways, All of this was my fault. I blamed myself for a long time bc of what I did. But now I'm not allowed to have any problem ever. I'm crazy for having doubts. I'm crazy for being mad if he does something I don't like. I overreact to everything. Anytime I confront him with an issue it's a fight and he insists I apologize. If I dont, he tells me to fuck off. That he's wasted his time with me. I blame everything on my mental illness. I have no sense of personal responsibility apparently, even though he's the one that gets angry anytime he does something wrong. It is never his fault. And if it is, it's not a big deal. I need to stop overreacting. He lies about the smallest things and then gets mad when I find out and confront him. He is really wearing me down. I took alot of the blame for so long but I can't anymore. I'm losing my mind. He tells me that I make him miserable with my constant depression and my doubt. I beat myself up for too long over my mistake and let him walk all over me by putting up with his constant shit for a year. I don't know what to believe anymore. Am I paranoid or am I not? He says that isn't who he is anymore but I don't feel like I ever knew him at all. He has completely destroyed my self esteem, my sense of security, and my hopes. I love him and I want to make it work. But he's sucking the life out of me. My mom killed herself when I was 16 and he often tells me I'll end up like her anytime I'm depressed. He says my mental illness is no excuse but then uses it against me when it's to his advantage. Please help me understand what I'm doing wrong. I have literally changed my entire life for him. I got on meds for him. I took a charge for him. I don't do anything good for me anymore. I honestly hate myself bc he's made me feel like I'm incapable of being loved the way I want to be. I just sit there and try to talk to him only to be ignored. I have to repeat everything and when he doesn't listen and I confront him I'm just a bitch. IDK what to do anymore.

I was so over him and truly was not sad over the breakup, but when he started to display so much anger after learning about my new relationship I resorted back to my old ways of thinking... That he is just so hurt and heartbroken and doesn't know how to express those emotions so he's using anger and threats and hurtful words. I started to feel so heartbroken FOR him. I felt like I was feeling his heartbreak in my own chest. Every time I would think about how I did this to him I would break down.

I felt so bad and regretful of ever leaving him and moving on. He confessed all his love for me and everything he would have done for me and how he would have fought for me forever and that I just left him. I of course would cater to his every whim and try my hardest to make him feel better, only for him to go back to his manipulation and threats. I found myself really victimizing him and placing all the blame on myself. \n\nMy loved ones have been helping me understand the amount of abuse I went through and that these thoughts are just from him manipulating me, but it's all so confusing and emotionally taxing. I don't know what to feel. Should I be angry I was abused for 3 years? Should I be happy I'm out of that? Should I be sad he's hurting? Should I feel guilty for being the bad guy?

They (our IRL friends happened to all be boys) had all the proof in the world, and they all knew me for years.

I thought I was crazy even with all this concrete evidence. I asked people from high school if they remembered how I was treated, and every single one of them said they did, even though she denied any abuse ever happening.\n\nThey made excuses for her and protected her (even some of the ones who were there and acknowledge she abused me in highschool). I tried so hard to stay friends with them, and I tried to make plans to hang out. Any outings that involved her took priority, even if she spontaneously asked them on a day they were supposed to meet up with me. She would be invited to things first, and only if she wasn't ~~invited~~ able to come\\* was I allowed to be considered. Even though they had their own separate chats/servers they were active in, she would spam and talk in all of our shared discord, facebook, and messenger groups/chats until I slowly left each one, and then unsurprisingly she would stop being active in the ones I left (they also failed to see how this was her trying to make me feel bad). She would ask them to take photos of her face, and they would post them on their freaking snapchats every time they went out together. They were sensitive about how she would feel if I was invited to the same thing as her, but couldn't return the favor for me.\n\nOne day I stopped reaching out to them, and we never hung out or played games online together again. I wasn't competing - I was okay sharing our friends. I just wanted to still have friends. She \"won\" and all our mutual IRL friends chose her over me.\n\nShe's not even clever about how mistreats people. It's blatant and obvious without even pushing or digging. You don't need to read between the lines to see the manipulation. I'm not intuitive, or particularly adept at recognizing narcissistic people. I was weak, shy, and scared that I would lose all my friends if I stopped being her best friend. I knew this would happen. I knew she was shitty. I knew she would turn all our friends against me, and that they would all \"report\" on me to her. I was stuck either having a shitty friend or no friend at all. They don't have that excuse - they have extensive support and other circles of friends. They're not stuck like I was. They just think she's fun, and either refuse to or are unable to see what a monster she is. Several of them do have crushes on her, so I guess that explains it. Somehow, they just... are completely blind to her faults.\n\nI put up walls and I'm shy, so I can't make friends easily.

I was one of these individuals. I was extremely selfish, strong-willed, assertive, controlling, and downright harsh in conflict if I didn\u2019t get my way. This type of behavior stemmed into my love relationship, my family relationship, to my colleagues in the office, and to my friends. \n\nIn literally every aspect of my life, every disagreement, every decision to be made that would impact others, I was always right.

If someone else was going through something, I had the solution and I pushed them constantly to follow through with that advice.

I will tell you, I don\u2019t believe change is possible until you hit rock bottom. Someone like me needs to be at an ultimate low for the first step at even the possibility of a potential change. For me, this happened this past spring in 2019. I thought everything was fine. I had a good job where I was on track to make a well into the 6 figures for a salary, a masters degree and several professional certifications, a loving set of parents, I lived in an upscale condo overlooking the intracoastal and a beach, a vast group of \u201cfriends\u201d, and I was engaged to the most beautiful, caring, most compassionate woman I have ever met. Yes, she was a smokin\u2019 hot Blonde lol, but she was much more than that. She was also successful in her career, she supported my dreams and ambitions, she was the light of any room she walked in to. You could just tell there was something special about her within 5 minutes of meeting her. I had every possibly blessing you could imagine, right? I did! But there was more than met the eye. My entire life was a lie. I was so dark inside and full of the highest level of insecurity, but no one could know. I thought I did well at masking everything and thought I had complete control over my life, but I was so wrong. \n\nThe start of my journey is what will call \u201cthe drain\u201d. I\u2019m not sure of the exact day this started, but the \u201cplug\u201d of my life was pulled, and my life started spiraling out of control. This process took many years, and it was a very very slow process. Over the course of many years, I slowly lost friends. One by one, they started vanishing. I blamed it on the fact that our lives were going separate ways, or we simply had different interests. I also started to become the black sheep of my family. I could tell they thought of me differently and looked at me differently. I didn\u2019t think anything of it. I\u2019m getting older and growing up, right? That\u2019s part of it, right? I had a high paying job at an investment bank and was banking tons of money towards my future. I eventually met my fianc\u00e9 and I did everything to get her, and I did. I like to fish, so we\u2019ll call her the \u201cbest catch\u201d imaginable. She was that IGFA record-breaking Marlin. It took about a year before she started to notice some very alarming flaws in me. She would bring them up in a way that any angel would and she confronted me nicely with her concerns. I lashed back and immediately made sure she knew I thought she was just being crazy, and that I was the best thing since sliced bread. She didn\u2019t buy it bc she\u2019s smarter than that\u2026..and because I wasn\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t know that yet. \n\nLet\u2019s skip ahead a year. At this point, I have a new job. Commission only. I left a high-paying job because I thought I deserved more and I didn\u2019t feel like I was respected at my old firm. It was their fault, not mine, of course. Things were still going well at this point. I started noticing real problems with my family. Not my problem. I don\u2019t need them.   \n One more year. I had yet to land a commission check and I was blowing through my savings like a broken ATM machine in a hurricane. It\u2019s ok. I\u2019m great with finances. The best actually, right? I\u2019m having constant conflict with my girlfriend (before proposal), but it was allllllll her fault. \n\nNext year. I still haven\u2019t closed a deal. I\u2019m running out of money. My stress is at an all-time high, but no one can know that I\u2019m struggling so hard inside. I take my stresses out on my now fianc\u00e9, my family, and the few friends I had left, which I could count on one hand. \n\n2019: This is when it started. The \u201cwater\u201d of my life was drying up and was almost completely down the drain. I STILL have not closed a deal up to this point. I was literally close to broke. My family hates me, and then my fianc\u00e9 has had enough. She throws in the towel. I thought she was crazy. I resented her so bad and made sure she knew what kind of mistake she was making. I did everything in my power to make her believe I was better without her. In reality, I was heartbroken. I started to realize I have literally lost everything. I STILL could not let the world see that. \n\nLet\u2019s call this next part of my life \u201cRock Bottom\u201d. I was low as low could be. I had nothing and absolutely zero control of my life. That\u2019s what it happened. Realization hit. I realized I couldn\u2019t get out on my own. I should have mentioned this before, but I was a \u201cChristian\u201d, meaning I was raised in a Christian home, attended a high-end, affluent Christian school throughout grade school, and \u201cprayed\u201d on occasion. Sure, I believed in God, but I my relationship with him was close to nothing. I quickly realized that the downward spiral of my life was something God allowed, because he knew he had something better for me. Once I realized I was alone and finished, it was either give up my life completely and live in misery forever, or turn my life over to God. For the first time in my life, I cried out to God. Just like you see it in the movies. I literally cried and yelled and begged. Once I regained composure, I sincerely apologized to God and asked for forgiveness for the person who I had become. I told him my life is not my own, and I want nothing to do with it. I want no control. I want to turn over everything to him. Literally everything. I prayed for strength, trust, and patience, and then vowed to never try to run my life again or make a major life decision without praying and asking God for guidance first. \n\nLet\u2019s call this next part of my life the \u201cThe Starting Line\u201d. At this point of my life, I was still as miserable as it gets. In my mind, I still had nothing. Little did I know, I still had a support system. This support was from people I\u2019ve hurt! My mom, my dad, my now ex-fiance, and most importantly, my God. Even with all of this, there was no light at the end of the tunnel. \n\nLet\u2019s skip ahead. At this point the \u201crace\u201d of transformation was off. I had surpassed the 1st step of realization, and At this point, I had many different avenues of \u201cLife conditioning\u201d towards improving. I was seeing a professional counselor, I was reading self-improvement books, I was reading relationship books on how to treat a spouse and family. I started making daily goals and literally wear a rubber band on my wrist (I still wear it as I type this) which I pull way back and let go as a \u201cpunishment\u201d, or a reminder when I fall short of my plan and goals. I reached out to as many people in my life and actually gave a real and sincere apology, as well as an admittance to the person I was, and shared my goal of who I wanted to become. For someone who struggles with the highest level of insecurity you could imagine, this was as hard as it gets. They said they forgave me, but of course, they were skeptical. All of these steps were helping, but the absolute highest level of relief came from daily progress towards mending my relationship with God, and continuing to let him control literally every aspect of my life. Was all of this easy at this point? Absolutely not. My ex-fiance and my family clearly doubt my intentions and questions the legitimacy of this \u201ctransformation\u201d. I really can\u2019t blame them. I mean, look who I was just a few short months ago? Despite the feeling of doubt, I prayed about it and asked for patience. Through my readings and through my prayer, I could feel God continue to tell me, \u201clet me continue to work in you, and I will work in them towards restoring the relationships I broke\u201d. \n\nFast-forward, I\u2019ve been running this race of transformation for awhile. I have still continued my daily conditioning of the variety of avenues, but this is the point when I realized something amazing. What I thought was the worst part of my life, was actually the opposite. I had never seen a more clear path in my life, and it was all because God was the caption of my ship of life. The \u201crock bottom\u201d fall was actually the best thing that had ever happened to me. I literally would feel God speaking to me. I would have doubt or have a question on if I\u2019m doing something right, and BOOM, the next day a reading would address my exact issue. I would feel like I need more help an BOOM, the pastor of my church would preach a message that was written DIRECTLY for me. I asked for more guidance and BOOM, that same pastor decides to literally stop the normal process of a 70,000 member church and start an 8-week \u201cfreedom\u201d class because he felt people needed transformation and healing in their life. All of this can be directed towards one focal point of change in my life: truly turning my life over to God and letting him direct every one of my paths. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk about where I am now. In my present day, I still have not closed a deal. I\u2019m close, but still nothing. I still am almost dead broke. My fianc\u00e9 is still my ex-fiance. I live at my parents house at 31 years old.  I still have little to no real friends. However, I feel better than ever. My relationship with God is as high as it has ever been. I literally look forward to every little bit of time I get to spend in church and literally cry every time the band does worship songs. My parents and my ex-fiance are still supportive. Sure, I slip up and I question God and I still get to very low points, but that\u2019s part of the growth and I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. I feel different. I actually feel compassion and want to show others kindness. Through my readings, I realized where I made several shortfalls in my reflection of love and even apologies to my fianc\u00e9 and my family. The daily conditioning is actually starting to become easier and more normal and it actually feels good!\n\nIf you\u2019ve read this much of my transformation story, I hate to let you know that there is no real ending. There will be no part titled \u201cthe finish line\u201d. The truth is, I\u2019ve realized that no one will ever be perfect because we aren\u2019t God. I will never be finished improving and conditioning myself towards being better. However, one thing I do know is that I\u2019m never going back to that old life. It was the old me and I want nothing to do with it. This is my new life and I am excited to see what the future brings. \n\nLet me tell you that the person I was in October 2018 would never even think about writing something like this. However, I realized my transformation journey not only changed my life, but can change others too. If you are still reading this, I want you to know there is hope. If you have been abused by someone like who I was, I\u2019d like to be the first to apologize on behalf of everyone who was like me. This might be the first apology you\u2019ve received like this, but I hope you can maintain the ability to forgive and eventually move on and restore the relationship with that person IF and ONLY IF you see God working in them. What can you do to help at this point? Never stop praying. My fianc\u00e9 prayed for me every day and I owe her my life. That person in your life can NOT change on their own, but if God gets ahold of them and their life is no longer their own, he WILL change them and you WILL see a true defining difference within them. DON\u2019T GIVE UP! Trust God, and he will fulfill your desires for change in that person. If you ARE the person I was, I hope by you being on this site means you your \u201clife water\u201d is empty and you hit rock bottom! FOLLOW MY PATH! Don\u2019t give up. Your life is NOT over and it is only getting started. Give up your life to God and watch him work. He will do more within you than you could ever imagine. Will it be easy? Absolutely NOT, but wake up each day and start it with a prayer and pray constantly throughout the day, and I PROMISE you will feel a refreshed beyond your deepest imagination. \n\nIn summary, transformation is possible. Someone like me will never be perfect, but when there\u2019s acknowledgement for the need for change and a will to give your life to God, there is a path towards success. Please use my transformation as an example. I truly hope I can use my journey to better others, in an effort to first show thanks to God for saving me, and to those who have made the decision to not give up on me and are willing to continue to let me mend the relationships with them that I\u2019ve destroyed. If you need encouragement, advice, guidance, or just have general questions about my journey or your own, please reach out to me! I\u2019m here. I WANT to help. You CAN do this! I will pray for you and look forward to witnessing God work in others as he did in me.\n\nThank you everyone!", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

But they have a son so no chance of no contact. \nIt is a long and crazy story but... I became pregnant and that's the first moment she tried to hoover, even started sending me messages telling me I shouldn't be mad or angry- they want to be together. Now... my bf doesn't really know he was with a narcissist, he is the type of guy who sees the good in everyone but that hoover (last year) almost worked. I was married to an N in the past and know full well what she is\nWell low and behold she was dating another man at the same time and it came out. My theory was and still is she was jealous and just wanted to destroy our relationship. Didn't matter I was pregnant. She wanted and did cause a lot of pain. \nFast forward through all the crap I needed to do to move past this myself... and in the meantime she also gets pregnant and married this poor soul... and less than 2 months after her baby was born she tried to hoover again?! Even going so far as to say that her new husband knows that my bf is the love of her life and also trying to smear me by saying I'm a terrible person (I told her off... she will never forget that and I have no regrets). All this after a year of nothing... well she was pregnant, maybe she took a break? \nAnyway... point of the post is. He can't go no contact, obviously because she has custody of his son. She lives in Europe and we... don't. So he can only talk to his son on Skype. And she uses these interactions to manipulate him and eventually she will try to hoover him again. He rejected her this last time but of course we know this is a never ending cycle of abuse. \nHe is starting to learn about narcissism now. One of his core beliefs is that all people are good, and I think he is having a hard time letting that go. \nIn the meantime our family is at stake too. I knew what he is going through as I have been down the narc train before but I only have so much patience and I have our child's future to consider as well.

We are now divorced. Domestic violence has no impact on parenting time, so I have to parent our daughter with him and see him/communicate with him regularly. I reported him for domestic violence and he was convicted but now his 18 month sentence is over. All in all, our daughter who is 3, is happy, bright, loving and kind. But it's me where I need some help. I wanted to reach out to you all. Here's my journal entry tonight. TIA for any advice or words of encouragement...\n\nJournal entry, October 2, 2019\n\nI don\u2019t know how to co-parent my child with the man who strangled me when I was 9 months pregnant. The man who broke the dining room chair, or the man who smashed my laptop against the brick fireplace when he got angry one night. The man who would get upset when I questioned him, or when I tried to talk about why we weren\u2019t doing well and then would blame me for trying to talk to him about these things. The man who screamed at me while I was cornered in the bathroom, pregnant, scared and crying. This was also the same man that apologized in between all of these rageful moments, telling me he knew it was his fault, he didn\u2019t know why he was like this, etc. I believed him but then it would just start all over again like some sick manipulative game. I stayed in it for a total of 18 months, and the worst of it was when I became pregnant when it felt \u201ctoo late\u201d to back out then.\n\nI don\u2019t really know how to be a parent (I really do wish there were a manual). Every day, some new hard lesson arises. When my daughter wakes up in the morning, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m going to get cranky toddler who pushes me away and asks for space, or sweet toddler who wants to snuggle but I try to remain boundaries, set limits and maintain a sense of calm through it all. Sometimes I lose it and I yell but I never hit. When I yell, I say I\u2019m sorry, or take a visibly deep breath in front of her, or tell her \u201cMommy needs to take a break to calm down\u201d. I always come back and repair with her. And I always talk to her about what had just happened, and we talk about what we should do next time. It always ends up with an \u201cI\u2019m sorry because \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\u201d from each of us, and a hug.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to heal from the trauma from my abusive relationship--my short-lived marriage with a man whom I thought immediately was \u201cthe one\u201d; who was charming, attractive, and who often made me feel safe. A man who promised me everything. A big, large, strong man who, when he held me, made me feel like the most protected human on the planet. When things were good, they were incredible. But when things were bad, they were worse than I think hell could be. It felt so confusing to be riding a rollercoaster from week to week or sometimes, from day to day. I\u2019d never experienced this before, so, why not give it a shot. It couldn\u2019t be that bad. It\u2019s just his own childhood trauma haunting him, but he would never hurt me, right? He will heal. Right? I would often call his mother and seek out help because he didn\u2019t know how to help himself and I didn\u2019t know how to help him. Because several times, I would find him with a knife to his wrist, or a door kicked down, or my car beat up inside because he got mad. I started to think it was all my fault. He made me believe--he told me--that I was an abuser, too. I started to believe him. I questioned myself and my \u201cgood-ness\u201d. I started to argue back, and once, I had slapped him so hard in the face because I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I\u2019ve never slapped anyone. I\u2019ve never harmed a living thing before in my life. I called the cops because I was scared and needed help, and then I was handcuffed and forced to leave my 12 week old baby for a night and a day in jail.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to stop the images from popping up in my mind these days. I am brought back for a split-second to a moment in time where there was awful rage from my ex. Perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019ve had to see him for exchanges with our child now that his probation is over.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to date, or sustain the relationship I am in with a kind, supportive, understanding, and emotionally healthy man I met when my daughter was 1.5 years old. Relationships are supposed to be a trust-filled bond, where you are each supposed to put energy into it. I don\u2019t have any energy. I take care of my daughter on my \u201coff days\u201d, which are mostly wonderful but also trying, and then I work on the other days. One day a week, my daughter is with her dad all day and I do get some time to myself. During that time, I clean my house and try to find time for self-care but I\u2019m so tired or worn out emotionally, that I end up not doing it. I just don\u2019t know how or if I can do it right now. And I also don\u2019t want to necessarily let go fully of the man I\u2019ve been seeing for over a year.\n\nI see a wonderful therapist who has gotten me through the last three years. I\u2019ve started to heal, learned to set and hold boundaries with my ex. But I still get messages from my ex at least once a week blaming me for something, or criticising me for something. I know I do not have to respond, so I do not. But I cannot escape it. How do I escape it? I\u2019m boundaried now. I\u2019m strong. But am I this strong? Is it always going to be this way? I am forced to communicate with him and see him for exchanges. His probation is over (I reported him to the police for DV in 2017 but his sentence is over), so I know have to figure out how to do all of this. I have to figure out how to see his face whilst feeling disgusted by him, how to sound calm in front of our daughter when I\u2019m rageful inside, how to sit during parent-teacher conferences while needing \\[more than anything in the world\\] a planet between us. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to do it all.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He once again brought up something I didn\u2019t do that he couldn\u2019t forgive me for (he thought I\u2019d flirted with a friend of his at a bar 2 weeks ago...I certainly did not).  We were sitting on his couch and I said \u201cseriously?? Are u bringing this up again??\u201d And he proceeded to go over the whole scenario again.  And he would not relent. I think he expected me to apologize and I would do no such thing. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong!! \nI said \u201cso you\u2019re  more interested in being right than saving this relationship?\u201d And he looked me square in the eyes and said \u201cyes\u201d.  I took a deep breath and said \u201cWOW\u201d.\n\nI got up from the couch, put my jacket on and he said \u201cthere\u2019s your purse\u201d and pointed at it. I said \u201cI see it\u201d. I grabbed it and turned to him and said, \u201c I love u but it\u2019s never enough for u\u201d and walked out and caught an Uber home. \n\nThat was six days ago. I have not heard a peep from him. \n\nWe had so many plans for the future. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d discard me so easily for something I didn\u2019t do. I\u2019m devastated and miss him terribly. I have such temptation to text him. But I know that all I miss is an illusion . \n\nI\u2019m pretty certain he\u2019s a narcissist bc he\u2019s called himself one. He even said \u201cfriends have called me a narcissist\u201d. I\u2019d never known one prior to him and  I don\u2019t honestly know what to think. Doesn\u2019t he miss me..?! Why won\u2019t he fucking apologize?? We were amazing and so happy together. I can\u2019t believe how it all fell apart overnight. One night. \n\nI\u2019ve never had someone refuse to fight for me before. And the fact is I would STILL take him back if only he\u2019d apologize. And all I can think about is texting him. I want to \u201cmake it all better\u201d and make all of it go away like it never happened. I just can\u2019t stop crying. \n\nHugs needed please.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was not a partner, I was not a boyfriend, and I was not a husband. I was simply a stepping stone. When I asked for her hand in marriage it was just another moment for her to feed her ego and add to her image. I was used for rep, for \u201clooks\u201d I was a puppet. She had me in the \u201cyou say jump, I say how high?\u201d  Mind set. Like a trained dog. I knew what I was and wasn\u2019t allowed to say. She knows that I have a deep fear of my loved ones being angry or upset with me stemming from childhood problems. She prayed on that, she used it against me. Broke me down and made me feel like I was treating her wrong. When I found evidence of her talking to other guys on her phone all she would say is \u201cwhy would you go through my stuff that\u2019s not like you\u201d once again her way of telling me my \u201cplace\u201d reinforcing the ideas of what you can and can\u2019t do, without out right saying it. Guilt tripping me when I caught her red handed. She forced me to cut off my sister, she even found problems with my friends and other family members. \u201cThey don\u2019t treat you right\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re abusing you\u201d she made me feel like all I had was her, like I was the black sheep in my family and all I had was her. She prayed on me, I was groomed and used. And when it all finally came to an end, she was the \u201cvictim\u201d she played it so well to the point that I felt guilty for walking away for my own well being and safety. If I would\u2019ve continued life with her I do not know if I would\u2019ve made it to 21. I was at my lowest, I had hit rock bottom towards the end of our relationship. Like an addict I hit rock bottom. She sensed me growing weak and eventually asked for a \u201cbreak\u201d cutting me off. Feeling more like a punishment than a break. When I came to her broken and needing her the most she simply told me in a mean growl \u201cget your shit together\u201d I gave 110% and I am still the \u201ccrazy\u201d one, I\u2019m still the one who needed to get it together or do more. I gave every bit of energy that I had to her, and it still was not enough. Some days when we\u2019d see each other her first words would be some kind of mean dig at something I didn\u2019t do or something I didn\u2019t say. She neglected me, and anytime I would explain my hurt she would simply reply \u201cI\u2019m hurting too\u201d my feelings never mattered. Hers was always in the spotlight, nights I would stay on the phone hours and hours to talk her through her guilt or her anxiety. Days I went into work with no sleep under my belt because we spent the night fighting finding absolutely no middle ground. When we finally cut things off she quickly got involved with an ex, an ex that I found evidence of her talking to behind my back. She is what she is, an abuser. A predator. She eats men alive, and I was just another shitty days work in her world. I realize that, but that doesn\u2019t numb the pain I have to face while she gets her freedom.

(He also anally raped me when I was 10 and sexually assaulted me throughout the years. I told my family back in March) so we had to move out. Since I was around 10, my family grew more and more toxic. Screaming because the norm and still kinda is. We have an apartment now but it's still getting ready. I would have probably been suicidally depressed if we moved out of my school district. So we were looking for affordable housing and couldn't get I to any. By luck we were able to secure this apartment (if everything goes right). Ny mom always says we could have been in a place if it wasn't for me wanting to continue to go to school there. She says it's my fault and it's becoming too much very quickly. I cant stand her. My dad has been supporting us since my mom cant work most days. (Fibromyalgia) My mom and dad REALLY dont work out. My dad full on screams because he is easily aggravated. My life has been a shitshow and my one bestfriend is the only one I can confide all this in. (Except the rape part, I didn't tell her yet) My mom ALWAYS plays the victim and its putting me in a toxic situation. I cant stand her. She makes me wish I never told anyone because ever since then, she tells the places were trying to get help with that the victims are being treated wrongfully and how it is sooo wrong that I got raped and we can find help sooner. I really am struggling rn. I have an attitude because of everything. When I'm at school, my teachers are noticing how beaten down I look.

How did your narcissist charm you?\n\nMy Story:\nI met my Narcissist through my good friend and Roommate.  He was the Godfather to her 2 sons and her Ex-Husband's BFF.  So there was times when her and I would drop off the boys or when her ex would pick them up. My now Husband would be there and he'd always flirt with me.  We went on a few dates before making it exclusive. He was always the perfect gentleman, He brought me flowers and open doors for me.  It was about 3 or 4 weeks after making it exclusive when my roommate recruited him into helping us clean the garage.  It was a big mess of junk and boxes, couldn't put a car in there if we'd tried. We decided to bite the bullet and get it done when there was a bad smell in there we couldn't find.  \nThis was the day that would seal the deal for me, The day  I would fall for my narcissist. \n\nSo we had gotten a lot of the cleaning done to the point we could put a car in there but we hadn't found the smell yet.  I was Sweeping under a desk that had 4 shelfs stacked on it.  Something was caught underneath it.  I bent down to get whatever it was. Coming back out I hit my head on the desk making it shake.  The next thing i know that mystery smell fell off the topself and landed on my head.  It was a cup that once contained Chocolate milk half of it left to sour But the cup had been over flowing the other half being full of Maggots (That was hard to type that word still makes me want to gag so I usually say Fly babies)  Now My thick hair was to the middle of my back an old Spiral perm still Curling half of it.  I'm going to say a Million because thats what it felt like Fly babies were stuck in my hair.  I was in pretty much shock.  My Friend said my face looked like Carrie's from the movie after the blood was dumped on her.  Anyways My Narcissist helped me to the bathroom and hand washed my hair and for the next hour picked fly babies out of it.

That was almost 12 years ago.

I didn't react well but I didn't do anything to deserve the vindictive behavior that followed.  I had moved my whole life to a new state to start a family with him and our third partner, his husband (we were poly), so it devastated me to lose my home, my family and my hopes for the future.  While he had his new supply and his husband, I had no one to help me shoulder the trauma of the situation.  I posted about what happened on Facebook.  I didn't cuss him out or go on a rant, but I did explain exactly what he had done to me and how I didn't know where I was going to live, etc.  Well, he did not like being exposed at all and became even more vindictive towards me.\n\nAfter I moved into my own place, I became very depressed, especially since I had shattered my toe at my job and could not work.  I was confined to my apartment with nothing to do but ruminate.  After a few months, though, I got a great new full time job and my toe finally healed enough for me to get around.  I started to feel more confident and less depressed.  I had heard that my nex lost his job and I thought maybe it would be a good time to set aside our differences and talk again.  I thought that maybe since I had turned a corner emotionally, maybe he had too but was too proud to reach out to me.\n\nWell, it turned out that all this time, he had been holding a grudge against me because he thought I stole some magic mushroom spores he had hidden away.  I heard from our mutual friend that after all those months, he was upset with me over that, but I had never even seen the spores.\n\nWe had a short text exchange in which I told him that I was a little bummed to hear that he thinks I stole from him and that I understood if he wasn't ready to talk to me, I just didn't want it to be because of something I didn't even do.  He said he believed me, but that something had been in the back of his mind for awhile.\n\nHe said that around the time I moved out, he had gotten a package in the mail with no return address; inside was a length of bamboo with a crack in it.  He said a week after that, he got fired from his job and since then he's been failing at a lot of things in his life.  Even his new supply is out of the picture.  Then he told me that he can't help thinking that some friend of mine saw my post on FB and decided to put a curse on him on my behalf by...  sending him a piece of cracked bamboo, I guess.  Yes, it was weird that there was no return address, but there's nothing inherently sinister about bamboo; if someone gave that to me as a gift, I'd be like \"Cool, where did this come from?\"\n\nBut basically, it was MY fault that he lost his job and his life was falling to shit.  I wrote that FB post, which got him cursed, and that's why he's failing at life.  I asked \"You don't really believe that, do you?\"  \"I do and I don't,\" was his reply.\n\nI couldn't believe it.  Here I was thinking that maybe he had mellowed out about everything and might even want to reach out to me, when instead, he had been clinging to all these untrue excuses to justify hating me.  I felt so stupid.  But it was also telling that he still can't take responsibility for his own actions and their consequences.  It's always someone else's fault.  The new supply he once found so much more appealing than me is a hippy who believes in reiki healing and chakras and all that crap, so I felt like saying \"Shouldn't the hippy's healing cosmic energy protect you from curses?\"  What I should have said was \"If there's any supernatural explanation for what's happening to you, maybe it's KARMA.\"\n\nThis all helped put things in perspective.  There I was miserable and crippled, made even worse by the thought of him just going on with life with his new supply while I cried.  It turned out he was doing far worse than I was.  I now have this great job and nice apartment, I'm making good money, getting out of debt, meeting great guys to spend time with, making new friends, working out and looking good.  I KNOW that this is eating at him.  And being exposed is what really pissed him off.  I was upset because I was losing everything I had changed my life for, while he was upset because I made him look bad on Facebook.\n\nAside from the realization that he will always blame me for his troubles, I realized that my revenge on him came naturally, without me trying.  I didn't improve my life just to spite him.  I had no choice but to move on and better myself.  Meanwhile he has no self introspection and will always be envious and jealous of other peoples' lives.  I know that knowing I'm doing well, or at least better than he is, fills him with anger.\n\nI told him if he ever wanted to talk about things, I'd be glad to listen, but did not seem interested at all in seeing me again anytime soon.\n\nI can't tell you how good it feels to walk into my new job with money in my pocket and cute guys texting me, knowing that at this moment, my nex is unemployed, sitting at home, desperately looking for new supply.

He was my first everything. I broke up with him 4 months ago because I found out he was trying to cheat on me with my friend's friend.\n\nI started sleeping with this guy (we'll call him X) about 3 months ago, I made it clear I just wanted to keep it casual because I won't be in a place to be in a relationship for a very long time.  We've been talking every day recently, and he's said some things that have triggered me however they aren't bad things to have said. For example, I was trying to talk to him about why he is so pessimistic about life and after talking about it for a little bit, X changed the topic to something completely unrelated.\n\nLogically, I understand he probably didn't feel comfortable delving deeper into his emotions and as someone he's just casually seeing, it's not my concern to try to work on that with him. However, it triggered memories of how my ex would stonewall me and never talk to me about his feelings. I have one particularly traumatic memory of when my ex was so angry over me not wanting to watch the same thing on Netflix that he turned over in bed and completely blanked me. I get more and more frantic as he became unresponsive because I was desperately trying to make it ok and I started crying, he tells me to stop crying because he needs sleep before work tomorrow and that he's tired of my shit. He tries to break up with me the next morning as I fall to the floor bawling my eyes out begging him not to leave and trying to make sense of how something as small as not wanting to watch the same show escalated to this.\n\nLater X and I were talking about tactics that narcs use to reel victims in and I mentioned how they have a sob story which is hard not to fall for. He responded along the lines of a lot of women don't fall for it because they have 'massive dick energy' and don't take anyone's shit. I know he didn't mean it as a dig but it triggered me as well. I've really struggled with feeling like I was dumb for falling for my ex's sob stories again and again, that I wasn't strong because I cried and begged for him so much throughout the relationship and that by staying I was somewhat complicit in the abuse carrying on. I wondered / still wonder whether there was something inherently weak in me that he saw that he knew he could exploit? I've learnt that narcs love empathetic people and I definitely relate to being an empath but still the question of being a weak/strong woman haunts me.\n\nX also mentioned something about having threesomes and offered to invite people in with us if I wanted him to ask them. Within the first 3 months of our relationship, my ex kept trying to ask me for a threesome and tried to change my views on polygamy, X's offering that just brought my mind back to a place where I felt like I was being exploited again.\n\nThese are all very minute instances and really X has done nothing wrong, but I didn't realise how even the tiniest things can set off my flashbacks and trigger depressive mood swings. I've been crying on and off the past few days remembering all the shit that my ex did to me and as a result, I'm finding it hard not to be distrustful of X. Both my dad and my ex are narcs so I've never had a positive experience with a man who's been close to me, X is the closest any man has been to me since my ex and I'm scared. I don't want him to be my boyfriend but even as essentially a FWB, I'm scared he's going to hurt me. He knows about my past with my Nex but the worry is still there.\n\nHas anyone else had weird experiences with flashbacks and dealing with trauma post-breakup with a nex?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I usually ate at my boyfriends house because the food there was clean and I stayed there as much as possible because that\u2019s where I felt safest and welcomed. My dad eventually forbade me from eating there, saying that I need to stop mooching off my BFs mom. So I did what he told me and stopped eating there. I didn\u2019t eat any more at home than I did before the rule. The food was still infested. I came home late  one night to find huge slugs in the kitchen. Without any slug trail I wondered. \u201cHow did they even get here?\u201d I walk around to the other side of the kitchen. I\u2019m starving I haven\u2019t eaten all day maybe I can at least get a chocolate milk. I start pouring the chocolate syrup into my glass of milk and reach for a spoon. As soon as I start stirring all the ants that had drowned in the chocolate syrup start floating to the top. Hundreds of them. I think I\u2019m going to throw up.

Donna suddenly shudders \u201cOh my god, I feel sorry for u/chickachickadamndamn!\u201d She gets up from the table and storms out of the restaurant. I start laughing hysterically. I don\u2019t know why. I can\u2019t control it. Why am I reacting like this? My laugh dies down and all I can say is I love Donna. She eventually comes back and we finish eating before we head home.

She called me to tell me she missed me, that her ex was arguing with her again, and that she missed our sex and intimacy. \n\nAfter that she pulled away, and whenever I\u2019d bring up the topic of our phone call, she\u2019d claim I was using her words against her and told me to stop rushing her. She said she felt something for me, and that\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t be seeing me while her ex was in the picture. \n\nAt this point I felt like she was keeping me on a hook, but I kept quiet to avoid conflict. Then the other night I invited her out with me and some friends. She asked where (now I know it was because she was going out with her ex and didn\u2019t want to run into me). She said she didn\u2019t want to go, but told me to go have fun, and that we could hang another time (first nice thing she said to me in awhile). I got drunk and invited her a couple more times before she said she was with her boyfriend, and he\u2019d kick my ass if she went. \n\nI didn\u2019t take that well, and exploded on her, telling her that he did nothing but treat her like shit, and that telling me someone would beat my ass just didn\u2019t sit well. This is the first ever time I had the balls to stand up for myself. I eventually told her I was arguing with her not because of that specific night, but because she had no problems using me for a year and I finally had to stand up for myself after being led on. \n\nTo put things into perspective: over the summer she love bombed me hard, all the while saying she wanted to stay single and would have sex with other men and women. She would get mad at me when I asked her why she would say she loved me while spending weeks on end in other people\u2019s hotel rooms. She would keep me hooked by saying she wanted us to be together after awhile. It turns out she was talking to her ex at the same time, and got mad at me again when I confronted her about it. She said it didn\u2019t change a thing about us and it \u201churt her feelings\u201d that I talked to her about it. Well that was obviously not the case, and she posted about how he was her number one days after coming home and cutting me out. \n\nThis is why I exploded. I felt disrespected and taken for granted. We argued into the next day and she tried to put words in my mouth and gaslight me. She said I was psycho for inviting her out so much in one night, and psycho for acting \u201cweird\u201d when she didn\u2019t do what I wanted, or when she would say \u201cmaybe\u201d to hanging out. She would never give me a straight answer, and I said something about it one time and she held onto it. The gaslighting came when she brought up a woman she was sleeping with in Hawaii, saying how I acted betrayed when in reality, I told her I was excited to hear about that story and said it was \u201chot.\u201d She saw I wasn\u2019t biting, and said our fight was stupid and went silent. \n\nNow I realize I sound crazy in this post but I wanted to explain every detail to confirm it and learn my lesson in case she\u2019s actually not a narc. Her actions made me like this. She would constantly throw me breadcrumbs, make me think there was hope and pull it out from under me as soon as her ex started behaving again. She admits to having a fear of being alone and had no trouble using me.\n\nI called her out for leading me on every time he misbehaved and she would tell me I took everything she said \u201ctoo seriously,\u201d and that I should stop manipulating her and leave her life if I couldn\u2019t respect our friendship. \n\nI replied of course I took the words of affection seriously. She said she meant it until she realized I was \u201cpsycho.\u201d I almost feel like she\u2019s using that word to make me feel like the crazy one and to take the responsibility off her back. \n\nI\u2019ll admit I started the last fight, but it was a product of built up negative energy that I was holding in. I told her that, but she didn\u2019t seem to understand and we decided to take space. She told me that I was doing this to myself, and that if she was hurting me that bad I should walk away. I personally feel crazy, but I was never like this before her. \n\nTLDR; I feel crazy after my ex (NEX?) discarded and mistreated me multiple times. I started an argument with her after letting my anger build. Now I\u2019m questioning whether or not I\u2019m the crazy one after she called me psycho for acting as if I was rushing her into things after she led me on with a phone call telling me she missed me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I left my nEx a week ago, and every day I realize more things that he lied about or manipulated me with or used to hurt and abuse me because he knew exactly how to. But at the same time, I look back on some stuff and just realize how ridiculous and pathetic it was. I think most of us probably have had some of those WTF moments with the narc in our lives. Statements they made that either at the time or looking back just made you think, \"Wait... what?! Are you serious right now?!\" \n\n\nI think it could be helpful to me and maybe to others to share some of those WTF moments. I found that ridicule was always the fastest way to make my nEx lose it, bc he was just so *sensitive.* I think having a little laugh at the narcs could help some of us decompress and remind ourselves they are not all-powerful super-beings who can succeed at manipulating everything. They can be (and often are) whiny and childish and ridiculous.\n\n\nI'd love to hear your war stories!

He sent me a text that said, \"There is absolutely no abuse going on...\" lol, really?!? He's just going to *tell* me?! At first I was angry about it, and that was the only msg I responded to out of the 20 or so messages. So I wrote back a few days later and said, \"You don't speak for me and *you* don't get to determine whether *you* abused me or not.\" His response was that he saw someone I knew post something on social media about believing abuse victims, and he \"thought he should have a chance to share his point of view.\" *That* made me actually laugh out loud. All I could think of was \"you're so vain...\" That he assumed that random post was about him OR thought that was a solid and convincing cover, on *top* of trying to just flat-out tell me there \"was no abuse\" like that was a normal thing to do... it said pretty much all it needed to, and I'm still getting a kick out of that ridiculous backpedal.\n\nYour turn!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

For the first 9 months he was Prince Charming. Attentive, had me on a pedestal, funny, helpful, interested in my life and hobbies, wanting to spend so much time with me. But There were definitely caution lights that I looked over. For example, he was a heavy drinker but I overlooked it because he never got black out drunk and lost control. He also had a crazy ex that still kept contacting him but he said he never responded to her, she just kept contacting him over and over again.\n\nThen I lost my job.\n\nI started seeing more bad behavior. He flirted with other women in front of me and my friends. He started bullying other people in front of me. When I confronted him on these issues, he took no fault and accused me of being jealous. My friends started to not like him.  I was seriously questioning the relationship. At the same time all of this was going on, he found a lump in my breast and encouraged me to go get it checked out. I was only 36 so I figured it was nothing. \n\nThen I got diagnosed with early stage breast cancer....\n\nAnd that\u2019s when the power shifted. I remember being so scared to involve him in any of my doctors appointments. I think I knew deep down that I couldn\u2019t trust him. In fact, the night that I got diagnosed, his crazy ex (who he claimed he never responded to) called him twice while we were lying in bed! But I was so scared of being abandoned when l had cancer. It was my deepest fear. He didn\u2019t leave at first. Stayed with me through my chemo and radiation treatments . I think he wanted to be seen as a hero that stood by my side. But the abuse got worse. He was constantly criticizing me. Bullying me. Putting me down subtly. During one fight, he told me he\u2019d kick my face in. But it never got physical. Others noticed. Even people who barely new us.  I begin to realize that he was a high functioning alcoholic. My chemo was a light treatment that didn\u2019t make me very sick so I could still work and function. But I would come home after work and sleep. And he continued going to bars. His life was not interrupted. \n\nAfter my treatment was over, I started fighting with him over his behavior. I was tired of his drinking. He denied having a problem. he even goaded me by drinking more to \u201ctest my reaction\u201d to show me that I could not control him. I was tired of the put downs and sarcasm. The constant \u201cjokes\u201d. I was tired that he continued to put going out to bars ahead of spending time with me. I was angry when he\u2019d use any excuse to bail on plans that he had with me and twist things around so that it was my fault. We were fighting constantly and he kept threatening that he was at the end of his rope with me. He was never wrong and rarely apologized. I still saw emails from the crazy ex, which he claimed that he never responded to. He pointed the finger at me saying that I was causing 95% of the fights and I needed to get a grip on my depression. He gave me an ultimatum, telling me that I needed to go to therapy or he was through. So I started searching for a therapist. I asked him to go to couples counseling so we could work on repairing the relationship together. At first he seemed open to it, but then he said he wouldn\u2019t go, that he didn\u2019t need therapy, only I did.\n\n\nMeanwhile, my self esteem was at an all time low. I lost most of my hair. My treatment threw me into menopause at age 37. I was very depressed over these things. I confided in him numerous times.\n\nThe discard happened a few weeks ago. We had yet another fight over something trivial, and he pinned it on me.  I broke down in tears on the phone, telling him that cancer had destroyed my self esteem.\n\nHe dumped me the next day in a cold and callous manner. I cried and begged for him not to leave. He said he\u2019s already dated someone who\u2019s depressed before and it didn\u2019t work (the crazy ex) he can\u2019t do it again. I asked him to go to therapy again. He told me that \u201che\u2019d go to therapy this week with me just to tell the therapist why he was breaking up with me\u201d. I ran out of his car devastated. \n\nI have gone NC but haven\u2019t heard a word from him since. It was even my birthday last week. Not a peep.  I am beyond shocked. How could someone who claimed to love me treat me like this?\n\nDo you think he has a new supply/woman? I am convinced he does. Otherwise, I think he\u2019d be in contact.\n\nHowever, I now see him for what he truly is. Part of me is relieved. I think I clung onto him because I was scared of being alone while dealing with cancer. But I can\u2019t believe he could discard me like a piece of trash after all that we\u2019ve been through. It makes no sense.\n\nI\u2019m also forcing myself to looking forward to dating again. I\u2019m excited to meet a man who isn\u2019t an abusive alcoholic.

I have trouble with everyday things like mental illness and home life but when I was at the age of 15, it was horrible.\n\nI was in middle school when I had met my ex and she was very kind and nice to me. She would invite me to anime conventions and take me places as best friends would but eventually became very clingy. I didn't have a problem with this at first as I was very naive. She would ask me to sleep at her place and I would agree as I simply saw it was a kind, friendly gesture. It soon became apparent that she wanted more than I had ever thought would come out of our friendship and it made me a bit uncomfortable at first. She would start to cuddle me at sleepovers and I would often have to sleep elsewhere because I didn't initially see her that way. Eventually she told me she had started liking a girl at school and I was relieve because I didn't think it was me. After telling me about it, we didn't speak much more about it and we had another sleep over or two before she confessed she liked me. I felt awkward and didn't know what else to do so I said I liked her too.\n\nfor context, I thought of myself as more ace/aro back when I was younger as there had only ever been on other person I truly ever liked and had dated a girl in the past but found it to be uncomfortable. Weeks went by and she became increasingly more touchy and clingy while I still thought it was a phase she would get over. Though when she used an alt account and tricked me into asking her out, it became apparent that is wasn't something small. \n\nNow I was easily manipulated when I was younger and can see that already the relationship was starting off bad but when I was 15, I didn't pay much mind to it as I thought every relationship involved having a clingy partner.\n\nAfter a few weeks (two to be exact), she pressured me into having sex with her and told me how nice it was and that I was doing good. I thought we were a bit young but went along with it so I could make her feel happy, even though afterwards it made me feel horrible. Then it started happening again and again. She would pressure me and I would give in and if I ever told her no, she would ignore me and argue with me. This started happening more and more as the months went on, her telling me it was okay and that I was hers.\n\nDuring all of this, she would argue and fight with me about the smallest things and when I didn't see her way, she would threaten to hurt herself and say I didn't love her. I was confused and frustrated by the end of each fight, but thought I had no one else but her and that I owed her everything, even my life.\n\nAfter months of being with her, she was slowly starting to isolate me from our friends, talking badly behind their backs and even telling me how awful they were, even though they were wonderful and treated me well. She hated when anyone else hugged me or when I gave them my attention and we would often fight about that too. Eventually the fights got so bad that they started happening at school and in front of everyone. I always felt embarrassed and she would make it my fault each and every time. This is when the physical abuse started happening. \n\nShe would sexually abuse me and make me feel trapped. She told me if I ever told anyone, she would get into serious trouble and as a 15 year old, I didn't want that shame of knowing I had been taken advantage of, so I stayed silent. She started to choke me and often times if I didn't do what she asked, would choke me into saying yes. Now a days I'm a more sexually active person but this wasn't love or sex, this was manipulation and abuse of power. \n\nI was always in fear of what she was going to say and how she would hurt me next and after 11 months of sexual, mental, and physical torment and abuse, I had enough. \n\nWe had another fight on my 16th birthday and she had been for a while telling myself she was the one for me but eventually the argument escalated to the point of which she told me \"Why don't you just break up with me then?!\" over text. At this point I had probably been crying of hours and after seeing the opportunity, I took it. I told her that if she really felt that way then I was breaking up with her. I could tell she was taken back and wanted to protest but I soon blocked her for that night, knowing I was probably going to feel regret, in which I did. \n\nI felt so empty without her, as if I was broken and half the person I used to be when I was with her. She made e an object and made sure I wasn't going to leave without feeling empty. The next few weeks were hectic as we tried to be friends but fought constantly and got on each others nerves. \n\nAfter a few weeks I ended up breaking down and telling my friends what had happened in our relationship and how abusive she was to me, but she retaliated by telling our friends I abused her and neglected her and that she had never bad mouth any of them. She tried her hardest but failed at being the innocent person everyone thought she was. She only had a few of our friends after that but not many. She always told me that I had no right telling my business to my friends or anyone but I think to some extent, that's wrong. \n\nThere's so much more she did but I would probably end up writing a whole book instead of a post about it. \n\nI'm slowly learning that I didn't deserve how I was treated and I don't wish for anyone to be treated like how I was. I've learned from this and want people to know that even if you feel like you still need a toxic person in your life or if you still want that toxic person that you deserve so much better. You deserve a person who treats you well and makes you happy and feel healthy. As of now, I've been with a guy who for over a year now and I definitely know now I deserve to be happy. He makes me the happiest I could ever be and I can safely say he makes me feel safe and makes me strive to be the best boyfriend I could ever be, even though it can be hard sometimes lol.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I agreed to come home and help him after we spent a weekend together as a family.  He seduced me with the promise of a new start for our family- and I stupidly believed him.  he asked me to move back in, and he helped me to move in.\n\nHe also needed to travel for work, so for 4 of the last 8 weeks, I have been taking care of the kids on my own, in his house.  He came at me really aggressively in divorce, and after being a SAHM for 8 years, he demanded full custody and child support.  I had no attorney, so I went into our first mediation and crafted a plan that worked well for all parties.  in it, I kept the kids at the house with him (he is not physically abusive, but I realize now he is insanely psychologically abusive)- I knew I needed to find work, and I knew as a divorced kid that moving out of one's home (the boys were born at home), is one of the biggest disruptors to their sense of safety and wellbeing.\n\nanyway, back to now.  last week he comes home- aggressive, muttering, saying nothing kind or helpful but complaining much, and loudly.  while he was away, the house went from being infested, hoarder house to the clean, playful, warm and inviting family home that the boys and I thrive in.  this seemed to inflame him.  he became verbally abusive, isolating me while the kids were getting a bath.  I still am in shock- this was a Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde situation.  I told him he was scaring me, and he told me to \"be scared.\"  Then he told me he was putting me out.\n\nI have confirmed that this is financial abuse.  I am writing bc the evil, cruel, narc actually did file an eviction notice.  the thing is, a) he invited me here on the premise that my work taking care of the house and the kids was my \"rent\", and that we would be spending the holidays together as a family, and would regroup on the living situation after the new year.  He was well aware that my role here was as a mother/caregiver- and that of course, includes cleaning, especially in a house that has pests and a rodent.  He moved my things in- where does he expect me to put it, if I don't \"touch his stuff.\"  Now, he also knows that my earnings, which aren't a whole lot, were set to go to the boys extracurriculars.  so this whole nasty act is poised to knock the wind out of our entire family for the holidays- and as narcissist supreme, he can be the one to \"help\" the kids feel better when he inevitably takes them shopping for toys, etc... essentially pushing me out of their lives.  this is beyond cruel.\n\nthe one thing I may have going for me is that I technically don't live here- I never changed my address.  I have keys to the house, which he gave to me, but I have no room, and I have a text from him insisting compliance (aka \"stop telling me I have a rat problem\") wherein he refers to me as a \"guest in his home, period\" on the same day he filed an evicition notice... so what can I do?  We all know narcs are liars, and eventually they have to show themselves.  not only do I need advice for how to dispute this, I need to know how best to drive him to show himself in court, to discredit this vile filing and leave me in peace to care for my kids.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

A week or 2 in I got an email. Describing himself and really he gave a good description of a narc, like how tiring it is to always have to pretend to people, to be pretending he is something he is not just to please people around him. He is a monster. So the second email which I didn\u2019t respond to was the I miss you tactic. As I didn\u2019t reply to emails he stopped trying. He has left 4 voice messages and tonight another one came through. I have not listened to any of them... there is fear in me that some are rageful and possibly even threatening on my life, the other horror would be him begging for me back or threatening suicide , he does every trick there is and I\u2019ve fallen for all of them before but not anymore.

I've been suffering from a severe bout of depression and I'm concerned that my family inadvertently caused me a lot of hardship. Please share your thoughts:\n\n* When I was younger, one of my parents (I don't want to identify which) would call me and my sibling (Don't want to identify the gender) \"son of a bitch\" when they were upset with us. They'd also tend to call us names like \"parasite\" and \"weirdo\" if they were especially provoked. However, they always regretted it after, felt sincere remorse and apologized. They only used such names when sufficiently incensed.\n* I had to beg this same parent to be able to do things like have sleepovers with friends. They always tried to prevent me from doing so for ridiculous reasons and I barely ever got to have one.\n* This same problem emerged when I tried to work part-time in High School. Excuses and justifications were made and I had to beg for the chance.\n* My parents were ill-informed when it came to entertainment and barely bought me or my sibling any games until we were a bit older. What upsets me regarding this is that I can't relate to others as easily as I would have been able to, had they allowed my reasonable request for a game every so often from when I was young.\n* I was recently diagnosed with adult ADHD and although it's impossible to always know of its existence, I had significant difficulties focusing in school, yet my parents would either blame me or offer encouragement without professional solutions.\n* I had to beg to receive medical attention when I caught a bad cause of pneumonia once. Even though I coughed up blood, one of my parents believes I never had it.\n\nI still wonder what this behavior qualifies as since my parents did show care and concern usually. It's just that many have suggested to me that some of their behaviors were destructive inadvertently.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I'm a woman who married a man if that matters. We were excited to start our lives together and things were good as we were building our lives together.\n\nLater down the line things went way downhill for me. He became controlling. He wanted me to spend less time with my family because his perception of them was they were bad people. He didn't like them because as they would give advice, he thought they were telling us how to live our lives. He stopped coming with me to see them except for Thanksgiving and Christmas. But of course he wanted me to spend time with his family. His family is great and I became close with his family particularly his mom. His mom is a control freak though.\n\nHe thought I was overspending so we agreed to put my direct deposit into his account. He told me I would get $80 a week. Some weeks he wouldn't give me the \"allowance.\" 2 years later I got my direct deposit back and left him.\n\nThe worst part though is he would have sex with me in the middle of the night while I was sleeping. I had slept through sex completely and I know more than once because I was a little sore in the morning. Twice I woke up to him inside me. \n\nHe was pretty good about when I told him to stop he wouldn't do it again. However, you should not have to be told to not have sex with someone while they are asleep. He said I was sleep talking so he thought I was awake and I have consent once before so he thought today extended to present day.\n\nHe has a lot of good qualities but I felt trapped. I would try to walk away to do something upstairs and he would hold me to hug me and kiss me. He would do it in a loving way but he's heavy handed and doesn't know how to tone down his strength. so I was trapped in his arms not wanting to be there and getting affection from someone I no longer loved. \n\nIn my mind we became roommates until I left. Or communication broke down. I wasn't telling him much of anything because I found out after counseling I was living with an abuser and that it's not okay with me. I was scared and didn't want to talk to him much. He would play videogames until he wanted to see me, not when I got home from work or wanted to actually receive love it affection. Of course me not saying anything to him gave him the message everything was fine.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I've done plenty of mistakes in my marriage too. But I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety while we were together and had been to counseling and been discharged a couple of times for non compliance. I've even spent time in a psych ward for wanting to kill myself. He had that much control. I handed my power over to him willingly and some not willingly.

I did it all .. the emotional pain never stopped but there were nights everything was good, cooked and went to bed together. In night I start crying again he shoved the medication I got \u201csleeping pills\u201d down my throat and poured water down my mouth over and over again while holding my nose .The months before this I was repeatedly getting kicked out and when I would beg and come back he would take me in and things would be okay.

I thought it was all my fault and I was insane ..  \n\nOne day, I had enough. One night at a motel, I knew all of my belongings were still in the ...house . How could he forbid me to come inside when my clothes,shoes,toothbrush..everything was home? I have work... I have no clothes for work ... i wanted to get out I felt homeless. I beg one last time... I get back and go through hell one last time.

I gave in, I told him okay thinking we are in public and it\u2019s okay. I wanted to hear what he will actually say because he began to act like this caring apologetic person for the first time in 3 years. The talk was not about closure, he told me where I was hanging out and who I was hanging out with my new friends... he knew and told me he has friends looking out for him(can anyone tell me what this means if he \u201c has friends looking out\u201d? His friends are stalking me or he has paid someone to?? Or it\u2019s actually him just stalking me ??) \n\n\nHe tells me we are getting to an uber back to his place . He grabs my arm and tells me not to try anything. I am distressed and in shock I just froze. I began to just listen ... I didn\u2019t run. I couldn\u2019t run.. I don\u2019t know why if I just ran it would have been okay.. the whole uber ride he is convincing the uber driver his love for me . He tells her \u201c love makes us do crazy things..right ?? Haha\u201d he tells me this over again... how much he loves me hugging me .. then we get to his place, he takes me bag and phone when I tried to leave . He offers me another drink... he held me down on the bed in the bedroom.. telling me not to leave and raped me . I was struggling to leave all night until I just fell asleep.. the next morning he literally bathed me . I felt like a baby being showered . He told me to brush my teeth it\u2019s like he wanted to make sure I was clean. He then told me we would have brunch outside and take me out before he leaves to work. I felt I had to agree just to be able to leave his presence . We talked about all the plans he had for me that he was going to propose and bought plane tickets for us somewhere and this comedy show.. that now he has no one to go with. That I ruined all this . Anyways when he left for work he hugged me and I just waved and left he kept asking if I will see him again and talk to him again... \n\nI went to the hospital and ended up charging him after he found out there was a guy interested in me and helping me and I was staying at his place with roommates for safety, he walked past my job again with his new supply very slowly.

{"post_id": "dd9pc9", "created_utc": 1570206502, "title": "I need advice on a messy situation", "author": "Tiamsthrowaway", "self_text": "\nHi, everyone. So as the title says, the situation I\u2018m in sucks absolute ass. I once posted on this subreddit with a different account, but deleted the post quickly. I\u2019m sorry if I sound kind of unemotional in all this, but I mostly accepted all of this - except for this situation I guess? I\u2018ll try to keep it short \ud83e\udd7a: (edit: it isn\u2018t short... sorry)\n\nI\u2018ve been sexually and physically abused by my father since I\u2018ve been 3 years old. He mostly molested me in my sleep, when I got older. I really thought he had stopped when I was 14 but I stayed at my parents home for a week in the holidays and it happened again at 21 years of age. And I fled the next day, acting normally. I went to holidays right after and I didn\u2019t want this shit to ruin everything. I was actually okay though, I thought this would\u2018ve fucked me up - but it didn\u2018t. I was pretty much kind of hardened up by this. I should mention that I barely remember anything from my childhood. Sadly he hasn\u2018t been the only one doing this kind of abuse, which makes this whole \u201estoryline\u201c absolutely unbelieveable. \n\nNow you see, when I was 15 I told my mom about this, but she didn\u2019t believe me. I usually came home on the weekends - but ever since that shit happened again - I don\u2018t. I mostly just came home to see my friends. So one weekend I came back home, and I thought, well, I can just lock this door and nothing will happen!   Luckily, nothing did! But the rest of the family immediately noticed and kept hounding and asking me about it - and I couldn\u2019t really say anything? \n\nThe \u201ereason\u201c being - My father got diagnosed with cancer one week before he felt the need to molest me again. And my brother also just got engaged. This sounds like the dumbest telenovela ever. Everything at once.  \n\nSo after the hounding about the locked door, I went out with my mom to go to a city that\u2019s 1 hour away, and she started telling me about how my father has to start chemotherapy (i knew beforehand because my two older brothers told me) and I couldn\u2018t really act surprised or show much emotion. So we entered the train, and she asked me why I locked the door that night and I actually spit it out, right in the train. I started saying \u201eRemember that thing I told you about when I was 15?\u201c and she almost immediately caught on. So to keep it short (... again): I told her, we cried, I went home, and I cried even more, and everyone wanted to know what the fuck was up with me, including my mom. I can\u2019t blame her so much though, her whole world has been torn apart...A whole bunch of stress.\n\nSo I don\u2018t come home anymore. Having finally talked about this with them, the situation kind of became so much real-er and I can\u2019t really bear to see him again. Especially if he\u2019s super sick. My mom is kind of acting up, she wants me to come home every week and I keep having to say no, keep having to explain everything to her, etc. My brothers fiancee visits very often, and is wondering where I am. My father is currently almost dying in chemotherapy. \n\nMy brother texted me this today: \u201eHey, when are you coming home? Are you stupid? You do know that dad is really sick! Come visit him\u201c\n\nMy mom and I don\u2018t know what to do. She told me my brothers probably won\u2019t believe me. I\u2019m mostly hurting over the others rather than myself. I don\u2018t want my brother to bring his fresh fiancee into a family with a pedophilic, incestuous father. I feel like its my responsibility to tell them, to protect her, and possibly their future children. I feel bad for \u201eripping apart\u201c the family, in a way. My brothers think I don\u2018t care for them and that I\u2018m probably a heartless monster for never visiting my father if he\u2018s almost dying.\n\nI do understand that I have to come out with the truth soon but the whole timing in this is absolutely horrid. My mom suggests to wait 6 weeks till he comes back from the therapy, so that she can \u201eask\u201c him about it. But that\u2018s way too long? They wont stop asking. I keep telling them that I can\u2018t say anything at the moment and that they should ask mom - but she also desperately wants me home, so I\u2018m super stuck in this. I can\u2018t say anything at the moment, but when do I do that? When can I do that? This is all so, so, so difficult.\n\nI want to mention that I go to therapy, and finally started a good apprenticeship I really enjoy after being in a really depressed and traumatized hole for years. I also have the best people around me! I\u2019ve never been as stable as I am now, which I\u2018m really happy about! I tirelessly work on being happy, which is super hard but I\u2018m doing really well. I don\u2018t want to lose my apprenticeship or ... well... my mind at all costs. I\u2018ve been noticing that I\u2018m starting to remember details I surpressed, such as recently: I\u2018ve been beat up every day. I\u2018m really glad I repressed all of this, but I\u2018m kind of scared that something might open this pandoras box... It\u2018s repressed for a reason...\n\nI really hope this was kind if understandable... I\u2018d really be thankful if anyone has got anything to say or comment on this because I\u2018m ultra lost...\n\nTL;DR: My father who recently molested me again, is in chemotherapy, my brothers don\u2019t know about this, my mother believes me now, the eldest just got a fiancee and is introducing her to everyone in our very traditional family and I can\u2018t come home anymore. They ask me why I\u2018m not coming to visit him, and why im not coming to see the fiancee. This sucks.\n\n\nThank you so much for reading", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}
{"post_id": "dd9sz9", "created_utc": 1570206964, "title": "Possible covert narcissist. Struggling", "author": "throwthebananaz", "self_text": "So I have slowly been realizing that perhaps I was involved with a covert narcissist. We met at work a little over a year ago. He quickly started messaging me, constantly complimenting me and talking me up. At the beginning he always wanted to see me, and wanted to progress very quickly sexually. \n\n\nAs I got to know him a bit more, I realized he was very private and didn\u2019t like sharing many details of his life. Deep emotional conversations were almost nonexistent. He only had one close-ish male friend, who I later found out recently didn\u2019t talk to him for 18 months over an argument about my possible nex being a \u201cselfish asshole.\u201d That friend\u2019s wife has also called him a narcissist. I also eventually found out he has three female friends he considers to be \u201cclose\u201d and they are all exes. I was never introduced to any of them because introducing me to them would mean he \u201ctrusted and valued me as much as he trusted and valued them.\u201d \n\n\nAfter the first few months, all of the effort seemed to go away. He was hot and cold and the ups from hearing from him and him wanting to spend time with me were great, but the downs where I wouldn\u2019t hear from him and he ignored me were very low. I never felt completely comfortable around him and always felt like something was \u201coff.\u201d When he got upset he never expressed it to me. He would just go silent and I\u2019d have to pull it out of him after hearing nothing for days.\n\n\nA few months later, I noticed him paying a lot of attention to another young co-worker. Noticed them eating alone a lot, whenever they got to work in the same area he\u2019d always comment on how he had \u201cgreat help\u201d or  that he was \u201ca lucky man.\u201d There were also times when I was with him where he\u2019d be messaging her. I asked him about it and if something was going on. He denied it. I still had a weird feeling in my gut about it but I took his denial as truth. I still continued to be suspicious, and he eventually asked for a break because apparently I was upset with him about every aspect of who he was (his words). \n\n\nA few weeks later we were back to talking and his attention and compliments were back. It was great. But again, I noticed another woman who he paid a lot of attention to. He always claimed she was just a friend. As attention slowly dwindled I started getting paranoid yet again. He started with subtle insults and passive-aggressiveness during this time too. Telling me I made myself look like an idiot, or that someone else \u201cretarded\u201d could do a task that he didn\u2019t want to do, like someone in my work position. When I called him out on not giving me the attention or affection I deserved, he passively aggressively said it was getting worse and worse and it rarely ever gets better.  He never wished me a happy birthday or acknowledged it. He never really did anything special for me. If we had plans and he finished what he was doing early, he\u2019d tell me he was going then, expecting me to be able to drop everything and meet him. Plans were always last minute. We always went where he wanted and watched what he wanted. \n\n\nAll I wanted was to get his affection back. Trauma bond as I guess you\u2019d call it. Anyway, it all blew up when I found out he lied to me about going on a week long vacation with a female friend. He claims she\u2019s and ex, proof showed that this woman thought they were together. I called him out on it, and he denied it, flipped it on me, told me he had never said he was going alone or that she was only there part of the time (even though she did), projected. Then I got dropped hard.\n\n\nI have been struggling. I still want his attention and it still hurts to think that I likely meant very little to him. I don\u2019t know if he is a narcissist or not, but I\u2019m also having a hard time healing. I did go NC for 3 weeks (or as best I could working with him and seeing him almost every day) but broke it last night and texted but still haven\u2019t gotten a response. It all hurts so bad.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Now flash back to present. I\u2019ve been speaking up about what she\u2019s done, seeing as it is unfair that she gets to be innocent and keep using men till they have nothing. She is going to seriously hurt someone. The point of all this is, they will do ANYTHING they will say ANYTHING if it protects their image. She went as far as falsely accusing me of sexual assault. They do not care about you, your feelings, or your freedom. None of that matters when it comes down to people knowing who they really are, they will go to any length to keep you from opening your mouth. If she was a child during the abuse I was too, where was my sympathy? She knew what she was doing she knew, she knew then, and she knows now. She\u2019s almost 19 now and she is a woman.

My divorce was finalized mid-September. I was doing well until exactly a week post-final judgment, my nex-husband called to create a shitstorm with me. I did really well gray-rocking him but it's just a reminder that I'll like have to deal with him off and on for the next 18-yrs (we share two minor children). He is 1,000-miles away and defaulted on the divorce so the courts awarded me full custody with zero time-sharing and yeah, he essentially fucked himself in the final judgment (HAHA jokes on him! He thought he was making my life hell by having to pay a lawyer all this money to assist me but in reality .. because he ghosted the process, he lost out in terms of control especially as it relates to the kids.)\n\nAnyway ... I digress...\n\nwhen he called that day, he, of course, kept using the terms \"we\" and \"us\". Referring to his girlfriend. The woman he cheated on me, left me and used my money to finance their initial love bombing relationship. My question is ... this won't last will it?\n\nI know better than to harp on this question but I just have to remind myself of the depth of this human being I know as my ex-husband. I was so blindsided and trauma attached for 8-years with him. But in my opinion he fell even further from what society would deem 'normal' or 'acceptable' adult. He is mid-30s now, no current job nor work history to obtain a decent job, he decided after we split to get a GIANT (and I mean GIANT) tattoo in the middle of his forehead. 0_0 And yeah ..from what I know he's selling dope out of this woman's apartment. She works at the local gas station, single mom of two kids (From what I know, she doesn't has full custody) and yeah .. I'm like, when is the other shoe going to drop? I know I'm not supposed to dwell on when the next relationship will falter; however, I still hear his voice and HER voice telling me \"how different their relationship is in comparison to me and my ex relationship\" and of course him reiterating how \"amazing of a woman she is and isn't crazy or stalkerish or controlling\" like me. *sigh*\n\nI guess I'm just overwhelmed by trying to pick the pieces back up from everything I believed in that turned into a lie and then trying to be a single mom without wanting to break down and cry EVERY NIGHT. I'm internally still bitter and I suppose hoping their relationship would dissolve soon or the mask would fall off so she would see what I tried telling her the first time she ever spoke to me -- which was .. he is going to ruin your life.\n\nI know that this is who he is. He will manipulate, control and take advantage of people for his own survival. He doesn't love her like he didn't love me. I think I'm still processing the illusion of the entire relationship; my truth vs his games/manipulation/abuse. \n\nI guess I'm back to ... can and will he change? Will he miraculously be this great guy for her? Even if he doesn't work and does illegal things, maybe he found a woman he can see as his equal and she'll let him be this narcissistic, controlling, his way or the highway person? Ah! I'm falling down a rabbit hole of doubt .. I just needed a reminder that he isn't going to somehow be more respectful of a relationship, another woman or genuinely love her in a way that would wow me and lead me to truly believe I was the problem. I have to reinforce that truth. He was not good for me and to me. He used me, abused me, took from me and controlled me. There was not respect or equality or even reciprocity .. there was an asset and a resource there for him. And same applies to him now ... I believe it's working in his favor until he gets bored, annoyed or both -- by then he'll be set to move on to his next person. \n\nUGH. Thank you all for letting me vent &lt;3 I'm working on getting to where I need to be in life, in my mind and in my heart. It's been hard. I can't afford counseling so this is truly a personal battle I'm working so hard daily to overcome.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We are in our mid twenties, she has been one of my best friends for over a decade. We had a falling out about 3 years ago and recently got back in contact and became close again. We are even neighbors now. I feel stressed out because I feel like I am walking on egg shells around her. She has been inviting me to hang out with this new friend group she has, I\u2019m afraid of saying the wrong thing and screwing things up for her. I took a trip with them and it all went fine. Today she introduced me to a new friend of hers and we got drinks and my friend of over a decade (A) wanted to take a picture of us with the drinks. And the new friend (B) said she didn\u2019t want it posted bc of whatever reason and then I think I made some remark about how A loves to take pictures and show pictures of her friends off to people. And I mentioned how when I met this guy she liked she sent him a picture of me (which she did) I was trying to honestly make a joke, or make light of how she always likes to take pics  but I guess it didn\u2019t turn out good. Once I left, B told A she felt uncomfortable and to delete the pic because I guess she was afraid A would show the pic off. A then texted me and said how it was inappropriate for me to bring that picture thing up etc and I asked her to call me or if we could talk in person instead of text. She then called me and we talked. She said she wants me back in her life and to stay in her life but that I need to make sure I am only saying positive and good things about her. I apologized and said I didn\u2019t mean to cause any trouble with you and B today and didn\u2019t think about it at the time, but now I see where you are coming from and I am sorry and will try to be more careful about what I say next time and said I would even reach out to B and clear anything up. She then proceeded to talk about the past and how she doesn\u2019t want it repeating itself. I messed up something with one of her sugar daddies 3 years ago. I admit I was in the wrong. She has a habit of compulsively lying to people to make herself look a certain way. Back then I ended up telling the sugar daddies friend and he told the sugar daddy and it fucked it up, and basically she blamed me for ruining her life etc. I felt bad for years bc I know I was in the wrong . Even tho she was lying she was still my friend and I shouldn\u2019t have done her like that. I would never do that now that I have matured. The reason why I ended up spilling it back then was bc I held up all the anger of her basically treating me like a side kick and telling me how to act around certain people. I just never felt good enough. However i know it was on me for spilling the lies. So I understand why she was upset today thinking maybe I had purposely said that to ruin something / wanting to clear that up. She said she wants to bring me around her new friends but I need to only say nice and positive things. I just feel like an idiot, always saying the wrong thing and feeling like shit right now. I am moving by her and now I\u2019m wondering if that was the wrong choice. I guess I can still distance myself and maybe decline invites to hang w her and her friends bc idk if I may say something wrong again.  I feel bad about the past and now I fucked up again by bringing up the picture thing.  I don\u2019t think she will ever trust me again after the sugar daddy thing \ud83d\ude1e which I understand she has a right to be upset but I also feel like shit when she brings up the past and my past mistakes.

My first abusive relationship was mental/emotional/physical abuse. And it was from the time I was 15 yo up until I finally left at 20. During those years he pushed me so far into the ground that I weighed 90 lbs when I left (I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d normal weight 120lbs). He would tell me I was worthless, no one else would ever love me, I was stupid, a slut and whore (even though I lost my virginity to him and never slept with anyone else). He also told me I\u2019m such a piece of shit that that\u2019s why my parents didn\u2019t even want me or love me (my grandmother raised me bc my parents were both hardcore heroin addicts). The first time he ever physically hit me was when I spilled juice on the table while we were mid argument. He told me to clean it up and I said something with an attitude (not sure what) and he slapped me so hard across the face that my earring flew out of my ear. I was shocked obviously. Mind you, one of his friends was standing right there and did and said nothing. One time we had been drinking and I passed out in bed. I woke up to him having sex with me (anal and he knew I didn\u2019t like that bc it hurt). When I started to wake up he laid there and stopped moving like nothing was happening. I was scared so I never said anything about it after that. Another time I wanted to go to a party. Which I was not allowed to do, he controlled everything. I was fed up and told him I\u2019m going anyway. He followed me up the street until we were behind a business that was up the street. He threw me down on the concrete and grabbed me by my throat and said \u201cmy dad is in jail for trying to kill his girlfriend and you\u2019re going to be next\u201d. I\u2019ve never actually feared for my life like that before. When I finally got away, I ran into a nearby diner and called my sister who I told that I got into a fight with another girl. Of course I went back and this continued. Funny how him cheating is what finally got me fed up enough to leave. That\u2019s only a fraction of what I dealt with. My childhood trauma included molestation by my own uncle and being raised by a grandmother who\u2019s bipolar and mentally abused me. My second romantic relationship was very similar and the first and lasted 3 years. Now I\u2019m currently 2 years into this relationship and it seems like he doesn\u2019t get the extent of what I\u2019ve gone through and what that kind of trauma can do to someone. He\u2019s told me to \u201cget over it\u201d when he\u2019s been mad. In fights he\u2019s also told me I\u2019m dumb and a bitch. One thing sticks in my head and I can\u2019t get it out. He said \u201cyou didn\u2019t learn from your past, you crumbled from it.\u201d He can be a good guy. I think he looks at it like I just had a bad relationship and should move on. But I\u2019ve been traumatized and I need help for him to get that. Any advice for me or him would be appreciated.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I am an international student and do not have the option of taking a semester off. I really want to ask my dad to co-sign the student loan but worry it will undermine everything. I am battling resentment, as he raised two non-bio sons in a comfortable home, and I am working two jobs, one of which is in the sex industry, trying to make my education work. He keeps saying how cautious he is being, and I feel I have to hide so much of my stress in order to make him comfortable.\n\nI am wondering if it would be inappropriate or detrimental to ask him to co-sign my student loan.

Please help me.", "author": "AbusiveConfessions", "self_text": "Hello,\n\nI want to start with saying I don't want any pity.\nAnd that if this isn't an appropriate place to post this I apologize. I don't know what the right thing to say as to what I want to get out of this post. I've been confronted with some harsh realities and I've always striven to be a good person. I realize that right now I am not a good person, so I suppose that I just want to own up to what I've done, that seems to be a good first step. \n\n My wife left me on Monday telling me I am abusive. At first I was shocked because I didn't see it. But as I've been confronted with the things I have done I realized it. \n\nA little backstory. I am 22 and she is 21, we got married just this year. We got together when we were 19. She also has MS and is disabled. That plays a huge role in this. \n\nThings started off perfect between us, this was my first real relationship in my adult life and I didn't know this would happen. There was a point about six months into our relationship that caused me trauma, I won't get into the details of that because I'm not looking for pity, but that served as a point of change in my mind, I was still only 19 when this occured and at first I felt I could handle it but as time went on that trauma got worse for me. This caused me, I believe in hindsight, to become extremely paranoid, which I believe may have been one of the catalysts for what started this. \n\nI have always been really bad with managing my money. And it got to a point where once we had started living together I had her manage both our funds, which was foolish because we had moved in together early into our relationship, and it was a lot of responsibility onto her early on in our relationship in hindsight. But I would be given a \"allowance\" for lack of a better term, and I would spend that, and then more, which would fuck up her budget she made and because I gave her the responsibility of taking care of the money, I'd get upset with her when we had cut short elsewhere. \n\nI did not do this intentionally, because just typing this up sounds extremely fucked up. I don't fucking know what's wrong with me or why I did this. It was always an accumulation of small purchases on credit cards like snacks from convenience stores and such. And I'd do some sort of mental gymnastics that made me believe she was the cause. I don't know what's wrong with me or why the fuck I did this. \n\nI was emotionally and psychologically abusive as well. Whenever we would get in a really bad fight I would self harm or threaten suicide. In those moments, I don't know why I did that. A lot of the time I \"see Red\" when confronted with criticism and I don't know why. And for me instead of anger that turned into self depreciation. And k. The worst of those times I would feel like because I had hurt her, I should repent for that by chasing myself physical pain. I have cut and burned myself as punishment to myself for hurting her feelings. And this is my genuine thought process. It has never been to win an argument or to try to get her to do something, but I totally understand why that is still extremely fucked up and abusive behavior. And it is the same with the suicide threats, whenever she'd threaten to break up, I would fall into despair in my mind. In my head, in those moments, I feel like nothing else matters except the relationship and if the relationship dies then I want to die. I would literally shut down and fall onto my knees in the fetal position and say I wanted to die... Then the fight would de-escalate, and I'd feel better, no longer suicidal. I don't know why I have these cataclysmic mindsets and all or none thought processes. I've started therapy in the last few days and I'm hoping I can get to the bottom of that. \n\nNow I mentioned that she has MS. She is wheelchair bound but can walk around the house. And I, for most of our relationship, worked in a hospital doing security, it was hard work, 12 hour shifts, flipping between nights and days. Her becoming wheelchair bound happened like a week after I got this job and me being available half the time made it very difficult to truly comprehensive the magnitude of the responsibility that had just befallen me as a caregiver, at 20 years old. But we thought we could handle it. \n\nAgain, I do not want pity, but I have recently realized that I have some mental health problems, ADHD, Depression, and what I strongly suspect is PTSD (I intend to get answers on that this week) all of which have been unaddressed until pretty much this week, except the ADHD which was a few months ago. But when she initially ended up disabled, I felt, what I guess is a male need to be the \"strong one\" so I always pushed my mental health problems aside, I ignored a lot of my own needs for her but in turn, I didn't realize that she was the one suffering from that, not me. She wanted me to get counseling for so long and I didn't until recently but it's too late. \nI'm on a tangent right now I apologize. So with all this in mind, as well as shift work, this caused me to have a lot of issues meeting my responsibilities to take care of myself, like going to the grocery store, but that also affected her when I would mope in depressive episodes and I was malnourishing not just myself but her because I was wallowing. I wasn't starving hs intentionally and I did it to me too. This is really fucked. \n\nFinally, in the last few weeks, physical abuse came into play. The first time, we were arguing about buying something at the grocery store as we were in the parking lot I was pushing her wheelchair around the corner and because I was angry she fell out of her chair. It was a complete accident on my part but she hurt her foot from it and got a big cut. I was immediately fucking horrified with myself for hurting her. I tried to help her up but she started to scream at me and hit me and people were watching so I panicked and said let's go before the cops come and we drove off... I am still fucking horrified that I am capable of doing this. I genuinely love her. Why he fuck couldn't I have just taken a deep breath and moved slower? \n\nThe second time was a week later and she had grabbed my shirt when we were arguing, because I was having a tendency to have massive anxiety attacks when confronted in the past few months and literally just shutting down and dissociating until she stopped arguing with me and walked away. She didn't want me to this time so she grabbed me as I was having an \"episode\" and I accidentally knocked her over in that struggle and she hit her head. And that is kind of the end of the marriage because of that and the wheelchair thing. Shortly after she left me, and as we have been talking lately she has told me all these things I have done to her. I never fucking realized I've done these things, and looking at screenshots of old nasty messages I've sent her made me horrified because I genuinely don't even remember saying them but the absolutely brutal things I've said shocked me. \n\nI think the first step is admitting you have a problem. Which at first I was reluctant to do, and that ruined the second chance I was so lucky to have in the first place and didn't really deserve. I will answer any questions and clarify anything you need me to. \n\nNow since this has happened though I have had a lot of self realizations and what I did, good intentioned, was try to tell her all these things. I confessed to what I did and through therapy I think I know a lot of the things wrong with me and a lot of the traumas from my past that may cause me to act the way I do. I Genuinely did not intend for that to seem like I was trying to justify or excuse my behavior. I am trying my best to confront who I am head on and face the consequences of why I've done, and part of that is trying to heal. So I explained these things to her with my intention being to show her I had found some causes and therefore would be better prepared to be better in the future. I sucked at letting go. We were supposed to just spend a few weeks apart and reassess the relationship but I couldn't let go and I kept trying to talk her into letting me come home. I was so emotionally codependent that I never stopped to think about how she felt and all I knew was the fact that I couldn't sleep without her by my side so I kept begging to come back I guess. I couldn't help myself. \n\nI don't want to get back together with my wife, I have clearly traumatized her and she feels I have ruined her life completely and manipulated and abused her for the past year and a half. I do not deny it. I do not want pity, but everywhere I look I only see resources for the victims of abuse, which of course makes perfect sense. But I am an abuser. And I wear that title with utmost fucking shame. I want to change who I am. I want to be able to get better and to be able to trust myself to not hurt the people I love. I genuinely loved my wife and I ruined it. Me. And I did horrible things and I don't know if it's possible to repent for those things I did but I desperately want to. I will continue therapy and deal with my anger and depression but I just feel like I am a monster. \n\nI guess what I want to know is, can I be fixed ever, or should I never date again? Because I won't do it if there is no changing this cycle, my guilt is genuine and I fucking hate that I did this to her so much. I never want to be this monster again.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I was her second affair (that I'm aware of), which started in her 13th month of marriage. She has, by her own admission, never been faithful to anyone.   \n\n\n Shortly after we ended our affair which lasted just short of a year and swearing to always be in each others lives as best friends, I experienced the discard around the time my father looked as though he would die shortly (he didn't and is still with us. But apparently this is a textbook time to discard). Shortly after this, I would become the third man (that I know of) to leave the platform because of her (the first being her first affair, the second being another man who experienced discard but was more platonic as far as I'm aware) At the time of my discard, her behaviour and other evidence pointed to the likelihood of a new supply. If it's on the same platform, which appears to be her favourite hunting ground, he will no doubt suffer the same fate if he hasn't already, and be replaced in the same fashion.   \n\n\n The people she does this to are all sworn to secrecy, made to feel like they are alone and unable to speak out and if they do, no one will care. They all end up leaving the platform. In some cases losing a channel they've worked hard to build for years. Meanwhile she continues to have her channel which she uses as a conveyor belt of narcissistic supply, her misdeeds covered up by herself and an entourage. Only the supply suffers, she is never accountable for anything.   \n\n\n A plan has been forming in my head. To set up social media accounts called \"HerTwitchName Accountable\" on which I would outline her behavior, along with photographs of she and I clearly together romantically (nothing explicit), screenshots of her talking to me about her previous affairs. Explaining that this is a resource specifically for people who have been affected by her behaviour.   \n\n\n It having her name in it, anyone searching for her should stumble across it. I don't target anyone, I don't have any contact with her, i dont actively go to people that watch her channel and say \"hey come look at this\", so no one can say it's harrassment. It just exists as somewhere people can come at the time of discard to know that they will be believed, taken seriously and that they aren't alone. That this has already happened, that they aren't isolated from the other people that this has happened to. They can add their voice to mine and I'll add mine to theirs. I'd include an explanation of what narcissism is, resources for healing in the hope that less people suffer the way that I have, lose less, get on the path to healing faster. It also makes it that bit more difficult for her to proceed in the fashion that she has until now. Perhaps her husband finds it and can get out sooner and with a more favourable settlement and before there are any children linking them.   \n\n\n I'd love to get thoughts on this. On one hand it seems like a great idea, and a noble pursuit. I always felt like there was a certain Weinsteiness to it all. Obviously it IS consensual, I'm referring more to how the people are separated, feel they won't be believed and fear backlash. On the other I'm concerned that I'm just talking myself into, and rationalizing an unhealthy action because I want to hit back and take revenge for the harm she'd caused me.

I was with my ex for ten years, we were engaged to be married and her parents are still as close to me as my own. I don't know when she started to be abusive towards me. \n\nShe had always had a problem respecting my boundaries, particularly with regards to her being physically intimate with others. She would cross any lines I set and then be upset that I was hurt by her actions, like it was my responsibility to just get over the things she did, even when she knew it wasn't okay. She would also constantly gaslight me about whether or not I had made my boundaries clear, and then threaten to break up with me when I had trouble trusting her afterwards. She definitely cheated more than once, even left me via text for some guy she met at a party, and began using my amazon account to watch movies with him. Note, I would not have minded her just using it, but I feel that it's crossing a line to use it for dates.\n\nI also always had to be incredibly careful with my words around her, I mean obviously everyone should try to not be an asshole but if anything I said could be interpreted as criticism that's how she'd take it. This of course lead to an explosion of anger and she'd shut herself off from me completely. Then she would accuse me of being manipulative for choosing my words so they could not be misinterpreted, and yell at me for flinching when she started to get angry at me. \n\nThere was also a lot of criticism, particularly in the bedroom. We were long distance for a long time, and so I will admit that I was not always the best at what I was trying to do. A few months before she dumped me she complained that she hadn't had an orgasm in a long time, yet she had refused to let me do any of the things I knew would actually give her one. She often refused intimacy like that, using it as a tool to control me, promising that if I let her do something that she would end up feeling more comfortable around me and want to be intimate. This culminated in a massive grief burst when she crossed a major boundary of mine and 'rewarded' me with sex. I felt so used and horrible, and she again began to yell at me about how that made her feel.

She later dumped me over text stating that we were tearing each other apart and that I could never get better while in a relationship with her.

I\u2019m not very sold on any of this being abuse and am pretty sure I\u2019m too sensitive and maybe creating some sort of narrative to justify being hurt? Don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t always see things clearly, like most of us.\n\nThis is about an ex. We just broke up but we still live together. I\u2019m beyond frustrated because we are exactly the same as before\u2014I wait on him and he goes out and acts irresponsibly. I was succeeding in separating myself from him for awhile but then he came down with a nasty cold and was barely taking care of himself so I slipped back into routine.\n\nI dated him for almost a year and he was mostly a nice guy until he (willingly) stopped working. He\u2019s got a side to him that is sweet, understanding, and perceptive but after he (on his own accord) quit his job and went broke  (for the second time) with only me to support him he\u2019s been understandably depressed, angry, and completely unaware of his own actions. \n\nI just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like walking on eggshells around him. If I was upset about something he\u2019d said to me or a way he treated me, he\u2019d tell me my emotions are too intense and I\u2019m too sensitive and maybe we need to break up and that I need to get my shit together. He would always say, \u201cYou\u2019re making me feel bad\u201d when I\u2019d cry and not even acknowledge that he\u2019d hurt me or attempt to understand when I would explain. He would tire out and say let\u2019s discuss it later and then he\u2019d proceed to leave me for a couple days and then pretend like nothing happened. On a couple occasions he\u2019s actually forgotten I was upset at all. He always feels like whatever he said or did that upset me is just me being sensitive because \u201cit\u2019s not like he\u2019s a horrible person\u201d. I literally have to explain to him that it has nothing to do with that, and all to do with how I would like to be treated and how I reacted to his statement.\n\nOne time, he got a $25 parking ticket and I picked it up and brought it inside with us. He was upset about the ticket and proceeded to yell at me and tell me I\u2019m wasting my time. When I explained I just wanted to throw it away properly, he continued to berate me for picking the ticket up (calling me stupid, told me I\u2019m stupid for \u201cpicking a fight with him\u201d when all I did was ask him not to talk to me like that, tell me I\u2019m wasting both of our time, etc...) until he stormed out. He came back later and I didn\u2019t even get an apology until I brought it up.\n\nWhen we were dating, I\u2019d say one wrong thing or be too verbally affectionate and suddenly it was like he\u2019d revoke my right to his affection and push me away verbally, physically, in every manner. \n\nEveryone needs space, I respect that. What this was, though, was me making the wrong type of joke (when he more or less relentlessly joked about me being incompetent 24/7) or just pointing out the wrong thing (\u201cdon\u2019t gulp down half a bottle of robitussin on an empty stomach\u201d has recently earned me a \u201cstop being annoying\u201d and we\u2019re not dating anymore) and him shutting me out without any sort of explanation.\n\nThe relationship started out with him putting me on a pedestal (you\u2019re so smart, I\u2019m reaching here, I don\u2019t deserve you) and slowly he started to tell me I\u2019m incompetent. He would tell me that I couldn\u2019t succeed in my prospective career but turn around and encourage me for exams. He would tell me I wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain my dream of owning land and animals because I\u2019m either \u201cshooting too low\u201d or, when he used to have the same dream as me it would be \u201cnot committed enough\u201d. When I\u2019d tell him I\u2019d clean the room (something he\u2019s done exactly twice), he\u2019d say, \u201cNo, you always say that and never do\u201d when I almost always do and he never does. And when I do clean it he would tell me it isn\u2019t good enough. He constantly made fun of my interests to the point that I wondered why he even kept me around.\n\nI could literally do nothing wrong and he\u2019d find a way to tell me I\u2019m being too much. One time I woke up and he asked me if I wanted to go to the gym and all I did was sigh before answering or getting up and he angrily said, \u201cNever mind. I don\u2019t want to deal with your shit.\u201d One time he broke up with me solely because I had been \u201cannoying him all morning\u201d. All I had done was talk to him, and he had been talking back! He rarely focuses on anything except his phone, so I thought I might as well take the rare opportunity of him responding to me as a chance to make conversation. My mistake. He had never communicated that I was being annoying.\n\nHe constantly told me he preferred thicker women. He told me I had no boobs, which is his favorite part of a woman (\u201cI would have sex with the ugliest goblin if it had nice titties.\u201d) He would constantly brag about how good he was in bed and when I would say it was ok (no foreplay, for example) he\u2019d say it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t find my body attractive. He would show me women he would want to have sex with. He would tell me that he had tons of girls who wanted to be with him but it\u2019d be too easy so he wanted me. When I joked that I wasn\u2019t sure they could take doing his laundry for him he told me he could find a girl to do his laundry in a heartbeat. He made me feel replaceable.\n\nThe worst part is when we broke up and I told him all this he was horrified and genuinely apologized, but told me he really had no recollection of behaving so horribly towards me. I recounted a time when I asked if he\u2019d go to the aquarium on a date with me and he yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking five year old. Why would you want me to go? So I can be on my phone bored? You\u2019re like a little kid. I don\u2019t want to go to the aquarium.\u201d I\u2019m a Biology major. I love the aquarium. Anyways, he has no recollection. He doesn\u2019t remember saying that at all, although he\u2019s willing to own up to it. \n\nMore recently, post breakup he really excitedly asked if I wanted to see this movie with him and I agreed. Later, I asked when he wanted to go and he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to see that fucking shit again.\u201d Confused because he literally just invited me, I asked about it and he said, \u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t spoil it in case you wanted to watch it.\u201d Today, it turns out he DOES want to see it after I ask him about it since I heard him on the phone telling someone he wants to see it again. He told me he doesn\u2019t remember saying that and it\u2019s very odd because he recalls being excited to see it again. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what to make of all this. I can tell he\u2019s not a malicious guy and none of this is intentional. We actually broke up because he was unhappy with our dynamic because it makes him feel like shit to treat me poorly I guess? It was too much on top of his increasing depression... He mentioned he doesn\u2019t know why I would allow him to treat me like this. \n\n I\u2019m just very confused. I feel like I make it sound worse than it is. I can\u2019t seem to figure out if he\u2019s as horrible as all these actions would say he is or as nice as he sometimes is (which, if I had to be honest, is not even that nice.) I feel very guilty because recently I find myself behaving the way he does towards me, picking up his language and called him \u201cstupid\u201d or \u201ca child\u201d. I don\u2019t like who I\u2019m becoming.\n\nSorry for the long post. This is more of a vent than anything.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Happened when I was 12-13.", "author": "undergroundblueberet", "self_text": "Hello.\n\nI had to create a whole different reddit account just to ask this question, because what I have to ask is so sensitive that my brother can't know what I ask this question or that I even follow this subreddit.\n\nSo I am a 22 single male from Texas. In the last two years, an event happened that made me consider be a foster parent in the near future. By near future I mean after I graduate college and start working. I am on my last semester in college, by the way. Anyways, I am considering being a single foster parent--and I have researched it, Texas allows it-- and began doing some more research to know what I will be signing up to. I stumbled upon a book from 2009 titled \"Success as a foster parent: everything you need to know about Foster Care,\" by the National Foster Parent Association. In the book, it talks about the application and it says in the case study, the social worker will ask if I have experienced or witnessed trauma or abuse in my life. The book also says \"they are referring to child abuse... or domestic violence.\" So that got me thinking about my own past, and I am at a crossroads about my own history. I have found myself revising my life events over some things that happened in my life.\n\nSo it happened while I was a middle schooler, I was 12-13 years old.  Money was running out in my house and each day we had less and less to eat. At the same time, I was bullied at school, and they got away because the teachers were on their side. So I came home, but my parents were very stressed. I remember that I used to be yelled at by my father. The reasons were because I listened to rock, I talked back, or I did things that were not normal (I remember that one time I got yelled at because I made a giant ball of paper because i wanted to see how big could I made it). When I began to listen to rock because other kids also listened to it and I wanted to fit in, I got called \"bizarre.\" \n\nOne day my dad was pissed at me for something that I don't remember, so I closed my fists and my dad got up walked to me and told me to punch him if I could. I was crying, and I did not wanted to punch him and I didn't but he kept telling me to do it. \n\nI also remember that one day my dad was so angry that he threatened with breaking my arms.\n\nI also remember that my dad would drop by my room to see what I was up to. He once found my journal and attempted to read it, but I took it away from him. He claimed that he had the right to read what I had written on it. \n\nI remember that I had to listen to my favorite music hidden from them, so I would not get into trouble.\n\nWhen I told my parents about the bullying and that I had no friends, they told me that they were going to support me. But then when we were discussing about something, my father told me \"that's why you don't have any friends.\" I was not able to trust them with anything for several years.\n\nHe also threatened to come by the school to check up what was I doing. I felt stressed when he said this. \n\nI also remember that he said that he was going to take my brother and I out from school.\n\nWe would get into discussions in which I was insulted, and I talked back, and I was ridiculed.\n\nI remember that my relief from all of this were videogames in the PC, which were highly restricted and frowned upon by my parents. So I had to play them in secrecy as well.\n\nI remember that when I had the opportunity to start high school in a different city away from my parents, I took it because I was tired of the bullying and this treatment, and I wanted to start over.\n\nI am starting to forget some events that happened during this period. I don't think that is good. With this new info about the case study, I don't know if I should call it emotional abuse or not. Sometimes I feel like I'm taking things out of proportion, and that it was not really abuse, but just angry parents. However, I also remember that in that time the feeling that I felt the most was not love for my parents. It was fear and resentment. I feared them in those times, I resented them whenever they left me alone. In those times I felt small and alone. I was alone and had no one.\n\nSo here is my crossroads. I could call it abuse and tell the social worker in the future that yes, I did experiemented abuse by my father, but if they come to live with me in the far future, they would take my foster child away from me because they would know my story. And I don't want to do them harm. They are not the same parents as they were 10-9 years ago. They have changed.\n\nOn the other hand I could deny that this ever happened, and that I did not experienced this. Which I would not be harming them, but I feel like that is betraying myself. I would be in denial about my feelings, and I would be a traitor to myself. I would be living a lie.\n\nAnd then there is the question: was it even emotional abuse to begin with?\n\nThank you.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Then other times I feel that this is just his abuse from his parents coming through and even if its going to be like this forever I made a commitment to stick with him, its not his fault, he doesn't mean it, and is trying to get better.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's the worse part.  I think this time he can tell I have finally given up and he really is trying to change but I resent all his progress and wish he would have done it 3 years ago.

Now that I'm finally safe, I'll sum up what happened. Sorry this is so long. I can't come up with a decent tldr.\n\n1.5 years of overlooking every red flag in the book. I feel so stupid for it now. \"Borrowing\" money. Conveniently forgetting his wallet at home on every date, when going to the supermarket, going to fill his car with gas, every time money was needed. Getting cornered and screamed at for the most random, tiniest things at times I could never anticipate had me on eggshells all the time. I had to start seeing a psychiatrist and start taking anxiety meds because he had me so anxious I was having near constant panic attacks, which he lived to lord over me and called me \"crazy\" and \"mentally ill\" or \"bipolar\" after that. I kept hoping he'd get better, I did start fighting back during our arguments and would break up with him, but every time he'd convince me he'd change and to not actually break up. I made the huge mistake of letting him move into my house, but not making an agreement for rent payment. Not a dime towards the house the entire time he lived there. Oh, and did I mention the dead bedroom? He had no interest in sex. That is, unless I'd taken medication that made me so sleepy I couldn't refuse, or was blackout drunk--he only got turned on by rapey situations. Otherwise, not interested. He was, however, addicted to porn.\n\nEventually I couldn't stand to even sleep in the same bed as him. I mean, the mattress was already giving me horrible back problems. But combined with his loud snoring, plus he'd wake up, fondle me, then yell at ME for waking him up because I MOVED the tiniest bit, I never got any sleep. I moved into the other room and bought a tiny mattress to sleep on the floor. Best sleep in months. He hated it, of course. Things began to go really badly. I could feel something wasn't right. \n\nMy feelings were soon confirmed. I got an anonymous email from one of his co-workers. All of his co-workers knew he masturbates, loudly, most mornings in the doctors' restroom. He obviously thinks no one can hear him, but a group of people often gather outside to listen and laugh. This is when I knew for sure he was porn addicted.\n\nI soon found out he was also hunting for young girls on Tinder. This was the second time in our relationship he'd been in Tinder. I was furious.i confronted him and he lied right to my face. This is when I knew I had to figure out how to get this man out of my house. I knew he'd never go willingly. I looked into state laws, and landlord/tenant laws were on his side--even though he had no lease and never paid a cent, because he'd changed it to his permanent address, I'd have to legally evict him. It would be costly and take a long time, and I'd have to endure his abuse in the meantime. If I left, I'd have to pay for my own accommodation and who knows what damage he'd inflict on my home? My only idea was to sell my house. I'd been meaning to move closer to my family anyway, and it gave the perfect excuse to force him out, and a good reason to get police involved if needed to remove him once the keys are handed over to the realtor. I gave him a month's notice and officially broke up with him. He was very angry, but tried hovering right up until the last minute. My sister came out help me pack, and he dilly dallied on moving out literally until a few hours before her plane landed (he is afraid of my sister for some reason?). He tried to keep me on the line for a bit...I did not go no contact yet as I was worried he might retaliate and come ruin the outside of my house while it was being shown to buyers...but eventually he had to explain to his family (he has no friends) about the breakup. He told them despite being together 1.5 years we were never really together, we were \"just friends\", he always knew I was \"bipolar\" and I was \"crazy\", everything I said about him being a cheat and liar and using me for money is a lie (of course) and he's the real victim in all this. However he recently decided to tell me off and break up with ME and block me on everything. As a friend of mine said, the trash took itself out. Meanwhile he's already back on Tinder and Plenty of Fish looking for 20-somethings, while I'm thinking I'll never be able to be in a relationship again. There are so many details I left out above, but it's already so long I don't want to make it any worse.\n\nI've made a new home in a new town and I'm okay physically, but I'm so messed up. I feel like I can't trust anyone anymore. Loud sounds, especially yelling, scare the crap out of me. I can't stand being cornered. I hate being in a car with someone else for fear I'll get yelled at for my driving. I don't ever want to share a bed again. I'm not sure I could ever have sex again without crying (this is the worst one). I hear his voice pointing out what I'm doing wrong all the time, or making those horrible passive-aggressive mean remarks that hurt so much. He's gone but his voice is still here and I hate it!\n\nI've been in relationships with other narcissists and I'm kicking myself for allowing this one from happening, you'd think I could have spotted this one from a mile away. And of all of the narcs I've been with, this guy was the worst of all of them. I've learned a very hard lesson. \ud83d\ude22", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I believe he was having sex with old bar flies and pretending they were his friends. He\u2019d get drunk and admit he slept with all of these women.\n\n- He\u2019d humiliate me at work and act like we weren\u2019t together. People at work assumed he wasn\u2019t my significant other.

He\u2019d eat dinner without me or disappear randomly. \n\n- He\u2019d go randomly silent and refuse to answer texts or interact. He\u2019d decide that I wasn\u2019t his girlfriend suddenly and start texting women when he wasn\u2019t amused by me for more than 5 minutes. \n\n- He would make fun of me after making me cry. \n\n- He would push me over the edge and call me crazy once I couldn\u2019t hold in my frustration any more... he\u2019d ignore me and insult me until I\u2019d blow up and then he\u2019d call me unstable.\n\n- He would make nasty comments about my body and then ask me why I couldn\u2019t get naked in front of him anymore... \n\n- He made promises he never intended to keep. \n\n- When the shower stopped working in his place that we shared, he refused to get it fixed and refused to let me have it fixed, forcing me to shower at work. \n\n- He got a DUI and took it out on me. He became angry and hostile while also expecting me to take care of the paperwork and phone calls...\n\n- After he got a DUI, I had to drive him to work and all he\u2019d do is insult my driving. He\u2019d always crack a beer in my car and drink on the way home from work.\n\nThings I Did:\n\n- I threw his phone down the hallway after days of silent treatment and insults. \n\n- I poured a beer on him once. \n\n- I threw his sneakers at him and told him to leave at one point.

He was unemployed and I supported both of us and payed rent and bills while he did nothing. \n\n- I hit the volume button on his radio once in the car because he turned up the music to ignore something I was saying.... He\u2019d always do it. I managed to smash his little car stereo into the compartment it was installed in. \n\nIn three years I did all of those things above and they were spaced far apart in our three years.

Started my current job 9 years ago. It was incredibly easy to spot the overt narcissistic boss as he is a massive bully. This I can cope with and deflect with ease, but the other one I'm really shocked and disturbed by. You see I had a relationship with the second guy who I now see exactly for what he is. Yes I was stupid to have the relationship with my boss in the first place I know but he seemed to really get me and was charming and kind and he just somehow managed to grow on me and get right inside my head. For a short time I did believe he was the one. I then started to wake up and notice that he was very quietly controlling me during the relationship and even though he never showed any threatening side I just became uncomfortable and exhausted. I was lucky enough to end the relationship with him amicably, or so I thought. Here's the thing, even though I managed to leave the relationship , I'm still stuck in work with both of these employers. I actually thought we were still friends and getting along fine for a long time but I'm now completely awake and aware now that the whole time I've believed this he has actually been sabotaging me. Neither one of the employers encourage friendships between the other girls, I think I can understand why now! They cause the women to fall out with each other by telling each of them to be careful because that girl has said bad things about you. They always employ single mothers who really need the work and they definitely feed off the drama between any of the women in the work place. The covert narcissist has been doing a fine and upstanding act of making me feel sorry for him because he has so many responsibilities and he has to sort out the drama between all the employees, what he's actually been doing is offloading a shit load of work onto me. I believe he's doing this to punish me for leaving him although I can't prove anything. Theres so many other tactics I've spotted now that I'm awake which would take forever to go through so I won't but how the hell do I deal with this shit until I find another job? I'm already gone grey rock and have even considered just going from work and taking my chances but I really don't have enough money saved for that. Also, I feel extremely bad for the other girls that are suffering now and the future girls that will inevitably be employed and put through the same process. Should I try to warn people or just go?

My parents are my caretakers and I will be moving but this month hopefully but still will need assistance from them for groceries and managing my finances. \n\nSince I was about 14, one of my parents has made me somewhat uncomfortable to spend too much time with them even though they never did or said anything to me that was out of line. My parents don't get along so I've always felt the need to try to fill the gap - provide extra attention to them. I hug them everyday and tell them I love them. \n\nOver the past year one of my parents has basically (I feel gross saying this) showered me with compliments on my appearance which I chalked up to them just wanting to boost my self esteem, as I have always had body image issues. But this year I felt uncomfortable hugging them because they gave me a wet kiss on the cheek and stroked my waist which I did not like. I dismissed it as me being oversensitive and I made up excuses for them. \n\nLast week though they did something that disturbed me and I cannot dismiss. I went to give them a hug goodnight like I always do, almost like a compulsion because I feel guilty if I don't. Well, I gave them a quick hug, and when I pulled away they pulled me back in and kissed me on my ear/cheek area with their tongue. \n\nI don't feel in any position to leave them because like I said I depend on them due to my disability. I know I need to see a therapist but I'm already on a waiting list and they said it will take months until I can see them. So this is where I vent about this stuff in the meantime.

I came to read about narcissist because my partner accidentally told me a few characteristics about herself that match the criteria and she herself told me that her psychologist told her she had some narcississt tendencies (but since I know she hides a lot of her personality, habits and behaviour from the therapist it is only natural that she only sees tendencies).\n\nThe problem is that, while unknowingly, I have commited some acts that fit into the narcissist criteria. Like, I always do it under the assumotion that I am doing it in response to thing she has done before (like going out partying and not telling her because she is highly judging about those kind of activities; or kissing a couple other girls at a party after she told me we were done and blocked me a few days back), but that is exactly what narcs do.

{"post_id": "derfmq", "created_utc": 1570489736, "title": "Still putting the pieces together, Part II", "author": "Starr_14", "self_text": "Last time I made a thread about looking back and putting the pieces together, I sorted through ancient memories of when my Nex would triangulate me by dangling information about his exes over my head. It was a pretty wild ride uncovering the true meanings of his words and how stupid I was to fall for his shitty attempts at covering it up. Now my mind decided to break out the big trauma file again and piece together yet another instance of me being naive and not doing enough. Plus, it brought up something I've noticed narcissists in general do, and I hope I'm not alone in falling victim to this. Anyway, story time:\n\nMy nex was Mormon and for two years he left on a missionary trip while I was left behind to wait for him. Long story short, he strung me along and began growing colder during that time until his weekly emails stopped all together. That detail aside, his return was pretty stressful but we managed to keep our now-psudeo relationship alive; he said he was willing to pretend to act like my boyfriend and fed me bread crumbs of hope that he would eventually love me again and make shit go back to normal if I stuck it out with him, to which I foolishly did. \n\nA few months post-return, we were on a call together just having some fun until he suddenly excused himself and ditched me to take a call, claiming that this number calling him has been doing that non stop for minutes now and that the area code of that number was from the area he did his missionary trip in. It took him well over an hour to get back to me and I got curious as to who he was talking to on the phone; reason for being curious was because he wasn't the type to really be answering phone calls or using his phone in general, really. He initially claims that it was just a convert to the church that he helped convert and I was cool with that but felt odd from his short answer. I paid no mind and went on about my day. That day turned to days and during a conversation, again, his phone goes off a lot and it's a repeat of that other time. Only this time he paused and then muttered under his breath \"Oh, its [Person] again.\"\n\n\"[Person]? who?\" I asked. I was getting some negative feelings born from years back when he would casually mention his exes in an attempt to make me jealous. He just replies \"[Person].\" As if I would know who she was, then went silent to speak to her on phone. \n\nTime passed again and we got into a convo where Nex expressed how irked he was that my friend and I (he is Male but openly a good friend to me and the friend who helped me begin looking into Nex in a more critical way; basically he began opening my eyes by highlighting Nex's behavior and showing me that it was toxic. This friend eventually began sticking close to me, hanging out more with me etc in order to not let me fall into Nex's manipulations) talked to each other in a kind way. That day him and I exchanged hearts jokingly after memeing around and Nex clearly had to go and tell me he hated that because he felt \"territorial\" over me. It felt off because with any girl he mentions in a slightly suggestive way, I would get a bit jealous but he would always turn it around in a way where he makes me feel like I'm being unreasonable. So at that point I retorted with \"Can say a similar thing about [Person]\"\n\nHe quips back quickly \"OP please no. [Person's] just a convert, but not to me.\"\n\nI was confused.  The hell was that supposed to mean? I asked him that he meant, and here is where today I realized I fell for shit again. I asked \"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"What part?\" Asking as if I asked what a specific part meant rather than what I actually asked (clarification of the entire response)\n\n\"The \"not to me\" part.\" \n\nOh the deflection he gave me. \"I baptized [Person] into the church. She was influenced to talk to us and from there she learned the gospel and was baptized.\" \n\nThat was not the \"but not to me\" part at all. I asked for clarification but he clarified what a convert meant, basically. He avoided the question and immediately changed the topic. At that point in time I was 5 years into the relationship,  so I had already learned not to really pry further into things in the fear of causing a fight or displeasure, especially since he kept implying that my good behavior was what determines whether or not the relationship would even survive, so I had to suck it up and stay on his good side. \n\nI realize now that when it came to this girl, he never gave me straight answers or just plain made me feel irrational for feeling jealous whenever he would name drop her and talk about how excited she was to always call and speak to him. I realize that there's still so much to unpack. I wonder what other lies I've fallen for. \n\nDoes any of your Nexes give you incomplete replies to questions towards their behavior or what they claim? I'd like to know if what I feel is legit. \n\nTL;DR: My brain randomly one day pieces together another instance of where I was deceived, revealing a behavioral pattern I think all narcs have.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My boundaries were so strong, a good thing in my eyes at least, that when she acted out I did not stay around for the abuse. This greatly upset her. I spent some time soul searching and knew in my heart it couldn't continue because nothing had really changed. When I let her know that I could not continue to see her, she went off on me. She told me that I was \"manipulative and full of anger.\" 2 things I always thought about her. She told me that I was blind to the way I treated her which to me was always how narcissists were in regards to they treat people.

I started noticing\u00a0attraction to males I never thought anything of it (it will come to bite me later) and I did okay in school I was known to have mental break downs from my bad social skills and with the guidance counselor was more of a door mat I never was handled with any professionalism, I got my act together before high school and I trudged though, in 2015 we moved up north to be closer with family and my depression began to worsen, there was a note in my file\u00a0 and I quote \u201c(school name and guidance counselor has given a recommendation to visit a local dr for a mental wellness check as he is struggling in school and after a one on one we see signs that lead to our recommendation, parent argued and refused\u201d tbh I struggled hard in high school and graduated with the skin of my ass, and this is where life turns I graduated and I was forced and my parents said I had a choice (I didn\u2019t) and the only time I got to go to a collage was for a media arts school and without the help of my old school or my parents I failed I dropped out with in 2 months\u00a0 in all of this I had somonis that I trusted to much and I was abused online and when I broke it off I disconnected\u00a0from reality to cope going day to day\u00a0 \n\nI was at this point suffering with clinical depression and a few others and I left my old job of 2 years to a office supply store where I had a gm that saw me as a punching bag (story for a different time) and my mom she told me to quit, get in trouble, I wasn\u2019t worth it, she wanted a discount on stuff she bought regularly, and between the both I began to lose it October 23 2018 I attempted suicide and I stopped as something told me so I flushed the razor so she wouldn\u2019t find it and I talked to my dr the next day and I broke down in his office I told him everything from the abuse on two end the lack of help I failed to get as it was on me to pay not my insurance 300$ per session to get mental help from therapy and this was held over my head but with my dr he had some weight he tossed\u00a0around he got me into a hospital about 50 minutes from me where I was stabilized in three days and I felt normal for the first time. While I was healing, I found out some things my mom on Facebook bragged about how she saved my life praise god (the chruch she goes to is a cult) broke any form of privacy, broke what people call the boundry of my room, so on the way home I she blasted was called the message on xm radio I remained quiet. I saw the intence change in my room she got rid of most of my items as she said it would be a hazard, she digged though my text messages instant messages and other things, I told her to leave my room alone my drs said to leave my room alone as it would upset the situation, I got home saw it and I just layed down wanting to cry as I was already at breaking point. She comes in playing what can be described as a Arabic christen prayer and she stares at me and she then snaps\u00a0 at me telling me how she hates what I become she takes my medication and flushes it and throws a bible at me tells me that is my medication (she is a pharmacist) the next day she hands me the invoices I had saved in my email, them the full 2k deductible and the overage 4k as my insurance ran out so I make due I dump my savings as I find out my she drained my checking and maxed out my credit card and what I had saved about 1.3k had all gone to paying what I had and this was like this for a few more months and I managed to get a job at a local super market and all the money I made was to pay off the debts I had massive ones, and she uses my discount and I mean uses it to the point of abuse and I get called in almost every day and gotten written up because my discount is used while on the clock (it\u2019s a write up office if your discount is used while on the clock as you could be using with the customers) and my mom was happy about it and I mean happy so I used most of my time at he park away from her to get time alone as she takes any form of me trying to reach out for help as some way to gas light me and use guilty trip me and this was common almost weekly arguments saying I am this that and the other and I did everything for you and it pull me down\u00a0 \n\nMoving out: I get enough and I get a hold of someone that let me rent I wanted to try it, it was great but one thing she told my family to not help me move at all. It was hard as I had to move all my stuff myself bed tv desk furniture ect.\u00a0And for a while this was great, I had space and I felt like I could breathe\u00a0then my depression and kicked in but I could manage it felt like the right move but it did not last as long as it felt.  \n\nThen at the end of the month she goes to my roommate tells him a lot convinces him and then me to move out with that my mom was happy I wasn\u2019t she got me back guilt tripped me all over pushed me hard all over. Then\u00a0I turned into her doormat she used every chance to criticize me enter my room and go through everything and she uses cleaning as an excuse I had to lock what I can even my pc as she is known to install spyware to \u201cWatch what I do for my own good\u201d then it was parental controls on the internet then it\u2019s then if I mess up its no outside world for me  \n\nAnd I am used for gas money and the money to pay the mechanic when she breaks it\u00a0 \n\nI feel trapped  \n\nI haven't been able save as it gets used on her things\u00a0 \n\nAnd I am lost working a job mindlessly \n\nAnd I am posting this as a current victim that feels with no way out and at risk of being reprimanded for it\u00a0\u00a0", "subreddit": "abuse"}

(Story time TRIGGER WARNING, GRAPHIC.)", "author": "ironcladdreamer", "self_text": "So this is a story I've been long waiting to share. Tonight seemed perfect seeing as the PTSD is shit and every detail is on a constant replay. It's fucked up in 1000 diffrent ways and detailed as all hell so a trigger warning in necessary. \n\nThis story took place a year and three months ago. \nPre story details: I was 17 when I originally met my AE. (abusive ex.)\nWe met on Whisper and me being as over trusting like any Seventeen about to be eighteen year old with daddy issues, I trusted him. He was 27. NO ONE in my family liked him, but I did so I didn't care. \n\nSo fast forward to 18, right after my graduation. He had gotten physical with me before, but nothing I couldn't handle. I'm 6'2 and grew up with a couple brothers that tought me how to fight. He lost his job as a construction worker and insisted we move to Oklahoma City with his oldest sister. (OS for short.) I told him no and went to walk out the door. He yelled at me, calling me a whore and telling me he hated me. I left. I went back to his apartment a day later to get the rest of my stuff. He slipped a couple date rape drugs in my drink. (I had a yet I cup full of Poweraid the kind you mix with water.) And I remember the world grtting blurry and going black. I woke up 7ish hours later in MY car, all my stuff in the back crossing a big ass metal bridge over water with a \"Welcome to _ State.\" Sign over head. It was probably around 2 A.M. I blacked back out and woke up at his sister's house. OS seemed sweet at first, and I did love AE so I tried to make it work. Until I found out that OS was doing hardcore meth. I don't think she was ever on this plain of existance. A few days went by amd AE had been doing meth too. I hadn't been around him, I was sleeping off whatever he was constantly keeping in my system. When I figured it out I stopped drinking anything he gave me and got my own drinks. (Usuallt tap water, hard to fuck with that.) Then it came out he was doing meth and I flipped my shit. I was screaming and cussing. I'm positive I said some things that would make a god do a double take. He started accusing me of cheating with the next door neighbor. (I didn't I had been sleeping most if the time, or on my phone.)  Its important to note the house was filthy. Like they had mutant roaches and fleas. So it didn't actually matter if you showered or not because you were filthy the second you stepped out of the shower. So the accusations went from me cheating to me doing meth. (Again I hadn't been.) He kept saying my eyes were the size of dinner plates and I was sneeking around. (Again lies.) So when I was pissing and he was yelling at me I told him I hadn't done anything and he hit me. He gave me my first bloodly nose. So there i am, on the bathroom floor, covered in my own piss and blood. I was apsolutely shocked. I didn't know what to do. But he did! He kept hitting me. Chipping my teeth, brusing me, fracturing the entirety of my radius. (A crack down the whole thing, doctor said I was 3 cm away from it snapping completely.) He goes and gets OS. She's holding me down. (I can't use my left arm to do anything without crying and I'm left hand dominant.) And he grabs a needle. I'm kicking, screaming, fighting, everything. He sits his 350 lbs self on my legs, and shoves the needle in my arm. It was dull as all hell. Suddenly I couldn't breathe, I was foaming as the mouth and my whole life was flashing before my eyes. He did it again. I felt the pain In my arm. And again. 30 CC of meth all together. mixed with 20 CC of his blood because he decided to throw that shit in there. (I only know Becuase later OS's son was telling me about it. He was a sweet kid.) I blacked out. And suprisingly I came to. I was laying on the couch and AE was holding me. Saying \"please come back to me, I need you, I love you please OP come back.\" He went to kiss me and I socked him in the face only to scream probably as loud as i could because my arm was apsolutely fucked. \"OP you're back! Don't you ever leave me again!\" I couldn't say anything. It was nice to feel wanted but I hated this man. With all of me. A few days passed and I had been sleeping more than usual. I noticed track marks on my skin and I didn't know what to do. I felt like I couldn't move most of the time, like everything was moving in slow motion and my brain wasn't working. On this particular day, I was unlucky enough to be awake, dosed off my dick on heroin. Yeah. Of all things he could have been giving he, heroin. How I didn't die, i dont know but anyways. I saw 5 men walk in. I can't remember faces or names or the conversation they had with AE but I learned what they had been doing. And in slow motion I watched as these men raped me. I couldn't move, I couldn't speak, and I couldn't feel anything but seeinf their faces, their dicks, the god awful amount of cum. I'm suprised I can even be around men now honestly. Atleast 20 people walked though the door that day. That I remember seeing. \nThat same day when I was coming off the high. AE and OS blamed ME for being prosituted out. The conversation was loosely \"if you were my baby girl lile you use to be those men wouldn't be using you like the whore you've become.\" I spit in his face. A bold choice, but the wrong one. He held me down, beat me, choked me. I remember him kneeling over me choking me just repeatedly saying \"bye, no one will miss you. Bye no one will find your body!\" With a sick fucking grin on his face. I blacked out and came too. He let up. I remember praying to God to just make it stop. Then OS pressed a hot heat gun (like you use to heat up the screen on a phone to melt the glue to replace the screen.) And pressed it against my face, my arm, my leg, and my boobs. Strangely enough being as sober as I was I remember just staring at her. A blank face. She didn't like that so she hit me. She grabbed my face and told me if I fucked up her life or her son's she'd kill me. I spit on her too. Again bold choice but the wrong one. She knocked at 2 of my back teeth and broke another. And I think maybe 3 days later AE had gotten me in the car. He was calling me a whore and telling me I was shitty. He was driving around, hitting me in the face. I felt it all this time. He told me \"im going to throw your body in a rock quary and no body will miss you.\"  I didn't care. I was ready. But there were bigger plans in-store for me with the man upstairs because I'm still here. He hit me with my phone and busted my eyebrow open. Temporarily blinded me, and finally drove back to OS's house. Then he said something I'll never forget. \"Were going to walk inside and I'm going to take my bonesaw ans cut your head off.\" And the only thing i had said in months. \"Bet.\" We walked inside, I got on my knees, put my hands behind my back, and he couldn't do it. He picked me up and was holding me. Telling me he was sorry and he loved me. I called him a pussy. He held me tighter. He held me though the night. The next day was July 5th. They got news the house was going to be raided. So he took OS's son, and OS and left. He left me there and said \"if you're here when I come back we'll leave, I swear.\" And he kissed me like he was never going to see me again. \nHe was right. Shortly after he left. I hooked up my laptop I had kept hidden in my luggage to the TV. (My screen was shattered.) And told my Granny everything. My computer was the only thing I had left he took my phones and sold my Xbox. \n\nSomehow by devine intervention she got the cops to come to the house and I left with the clothes on my back and a small backpack of things that mattered. I.e. my wallet a stuffed animal, my laptop and a notebook I ended up orignally writing this is along with half a dozen suicide notes. \n\nI ended up going home and am now happily married to a wonderful man who treats me like the Queen I am. with a son on the way. \n\nThough out the list of injuries I had had I was told due to the mass amount of drugs pushed though my system I wouldn't be able to bare children. (It was 10 CCs of something every day.) In the hospital they found meth, heroin, xannax, bath salts, like 4 diffrent kinds of daterape drugs and a few other things in my system alone with 7 broken ribs, my arm basically snapped, my nose so broken it wasn't attached to my face, my cheek bones shattered, my hips cracked in 2 diffrent places and several muscles bleeding under the skin. \n\nThis was alot and I apologize for it but I needed to get it out.

I didn't report it at the time, but now its coming to bite me in the ass. I need a loan and can't get one because of what she did to my credit. I'm in a precarious position, so my boyfriend insisted I reach out to my estranged father for advice, and hopefully financial help. In his words, \"everyone gets help from their parents\". I haven't spoken to my dad in about 12 years, but I did it. Financial fraud is why he divorced my mom.\n\nThings were going well at first. We talked about our relationship and after several exchanges, I asked if he would be willing to cosign on a loan for school, given the circumstances. He told me there \"was a time\" when he would have done anything for me, but not now. That he must protect \"his family\" financially, and from my PTSD. This man raised two non-bio sons under his roof while I was living with my drug addict mother. His reasoning hurts as much as \"no\" did. Not getting a loan means I will have to pay for school out of my merger savings. I am supposed to be moving in the next month, and I will have no financial safety net when I do.\n\nThe boyfriend who urged me to contact him also broke up with me this weekend. He accused me of using my dad for money, and said he \"just doesn't like me anymore\". A huge part of our breakup was due to my job as a stripper, something I did to rectify my precarious situation, and a job I am in the process of leaving. I was given a grant by my school's emergency fund last year and I don't know that they will be willing to help me again. I feel like floor keeps buckling under me.

She (F27) was in a relationship for four years before we got together, and we were friends who flirted a lot during her relationship.

I would always end up telling her I couldn\u2019t be her friends when we were so obviously attracted to each other. We would stop talking for months but we would always be drawn back to each other, like magnets.

Finally, her girlfriend broke up with her (for completely different reasons) and we got together shortly after. \n\nI had never been this happy. It was passionate, wonderful, we were so in sync, always together, laughing all the time, making passionate love, making plans for the future. It was all I had been hoping for four years. Finally! I thought it was the real deal. A week before she broke up with me, she sent me a text I\u2019ll always remember. She was on holiday and we hadn\u2019t seen each other for a week. She told me she missed me so much and she was longing to smell my perfume again.\n\nThen out of the blue, the discard. She would stop texting me as often, she would dismiss my attempt to see each other, she was distant, cold. \n\nShe broke up with me shortly after, explaining she was not ready for a relationship. She cried and apologized, asked if we could be friends and I said no. However I did tell her that we could wait a few months and see if we could be together again when she would feel more ready.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year now, and she never came back. \n\nAnd this hurts more than anything else in my life. I have overcome depression and high anxiety, but the fact that my Nex never came back to me, even though we always had an on/off relationship hurts so much.\n\nIt took years for us to be together and when we were, it lasted six months and then she discarded me like nothing happened, only to never come back after. Four years leading up to a relationship, then nothing, all over.\n\nNow, I know that NC is the best thing that could happen to me. I\u2019m not questioning that.

We\u2019re not following each other on social media and she has no way to know what I have become and it just hurts to think she has moved on.\n\n**TLDR; on/off relationship for years before actually dating each other for six months because she was already with someone else when we met. When we finally got together, it was passionate, we were very happy, making plans for the future. then out of the blue she discarded me, told me she was not ready for a relationship and never came back after the BU. It\u2019s been a year NC and I am hurt to see that she never came back even though we had a strong bond (we parted on good terms).

Then he started picking me apart, finding stuff that was wrong with me. So I tried to fix myself, but it was never good enough. No matter how hard I tried it was never enough and it\u2019s so frustrating.

I know I am the only one who can change it but it is so incredibly hard.\n\nFor the most part, the last week has been good. Good in the sense that we have spent time a lot of time together and he hasn't been a complete jerk. One day he asked me to go to the courthouse to pay his child support for him because he couldn't make it in time and if he didn't pay it that day, he would end up arrested and all this stuff. He was like you wouldn't want that would you? So of course, I help him out. The next day, he called me 3 times at work asking me to leave so I can help him out with his daughter. And got upset when I couldn't leave right away. He is always asking me to do little things for him, and I don't ever hesitate because I am too afraid to see what happens if I say no. I ask for as much as a text back, and I am needy/clingy, just asking for too much.\n\nYesterday, I didn't hear from him at all. This was after we spent the last 7 days together. To see each other and talk every day to nothing is confusing and upsetting. I go above and beyond for him then he basically disappears for no good reason. I don't know if I will hear from him today and if I do, he will ask why I called/texted him so many times. And I probably went overboard with 3 calls throughout the day and a few texts but I was worried too since he went to the hospital the other day. He will have some excuse and make me to be the bad guy in all of it. I hate that my mind goes into overdrive when he does stuff like that and I assume the worst.\n\nI am so sad today. Luckily, I have an appointment with my therapist this afternoon. I struggle to leave because I get breadcrumbs from him that I make out to be bigger then they are.

No kids, we\u2019re both in our mid 20s and no shared assets but we still have some of each other\u2019s belongings that are worth significant value. I initially wasn\u2019t even going to attempt getting mine back - I figured she either sold it or threw it away and wasnt going to bother but my attorney told me it\u2019s worth a try and that if she\u2019s asking me to return her something of hers, I have a right to ask as well. She told me today that she reached out to my nex about a month ago asking if she has it and never got a reply and that it might be worth a try to text her and see if I can get a reply. We\u2019ve been NC for the most part for over a year and it\u2019s saved my sanity so I was hesitant but for some reason today I just said \u201cfuck it\u201d and did it, I have nothing to lose by asking. \n\nThe resulting conversation we had over text was hilarious and my nex tried so hard to get a reaction out of me. It was a short conversation and she texted me about 4 times but I pretty much went grey rock and responded as neutrally as possible through all of this, not even reacting to her little jabs and attempts to get me angry and just telling her my attorney would contact her. She said she has my things so I\u2019m basically ending the conversation at this point because now I can tell my attorney and we can get things sorted. \n\nBut her last text was priceless. \n\nHer final reply: \n\n\u201c**Well didn\u2019t I marry a petty woman.**\n\n**You aren\u2019t holding my things hostage.**\n\n**Stop talking to me and go focus on your new girlfriend lol.**\u201d\n\nHUH?

I don\u2019t have a girlfriend, I\u2019m not even dating at the moment and this is the second time she has made a comment about my imaginary \u201cnew girlfriend\u201d (she said it to me about a year ago too when she was under the hilarious impression that I was now dating my best friend). I\u2019m pretty sure she still checks my social media despite me having her blocked everywhere. But even so, where the hell is she getting this info from, why does she think she knows my life and most importantly why does it bother her enough that she\u2019s said this to me TWICE? And how am I the petty one? She has given me absolutely no reason to trust her. Rhetorical question, I don\u2019t expect her to understand common sense anymore. \n\nSo I just replied: \u201cI\u2019ll tell my attorney you have it and she\u2019ll contact you, thanks for the laugh \ud83d\ude02\u201d and blocked her again so I can go back to NC because I have no interest in going back and forth. I didn\u2019t even want to have to contact her in the first place and I\u2019m surprised I even did it. The thought of even speaking to her terrifies me and sends me into a panic attack because her temper is insane and I can\u2019t face that anymore, it\u2019s too triggering and I was shaking and scared throughout that whole conversation. I\u2019m sure my reply fed right into her belief that I\u2019m petty but I honestly don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t need to explain or defend myself to her anymore and I have nothing to prove. If that\u2019s how she views me, nothing I say is going to change her mind. And I\u2019m sure as hell not gonna get mad and go back and forth with her, so I might as well be a smartass and get a good laugh out of it. Now that I see right through her, seeing her embarrass herself and jump to ridiculous conclusions about my life is the funniest damn thing. \n\nI had no idea she still cared so much but I wasn\u2019t gonna correct her. It\u2019s none of her business. But if she wants to believe a lie that she put into her own head and let it eat her alive, I\u2019m not gonna stop her.

Logically I know that everyone has issues and no relationship is perfect. But who stays with someone who just keeps cheating and cheating and cheating? This is my responsibility at this point, and I feel very weak and drained. After 3 years of being cheated on in every vile and traumatizing way you could imagine, I did it myself. I told him about it to be spiteful. I had never done anything like that in my entire life before, and I am not proud of it. I don\u2019t think that makes it okay. However, ever since then, he has only been doing the same thing he\u2019s always done except now if I have a problem with it, I am a slut. Now it\u2019s because I did it to him, despite knowing damn well it has nothing to do with me. He is 12 years older than me and still I\u2019m the one who has to completely hold his hand through any normal adult things. He\u2019s borrowed thousands of dollars from me, completely invalidates my feelings and my personhood whenever he gets a chance. \nObviously the logical answer is to leave. I am fairly smart, I am kind and a calm sensitive person by nature. I got in this and stayed for the first while because it was easier to me than being with someone who I felt I didn\u2019t deserve. I settled because I had low expectations of myself and also because the behavior is so shocking, still, to me that it has become more \u201creal\u201d than anything else. When I\u2019m alone for a few days but not broken up, I feel free and relieved. I dread seeing him again. I then contort myself to be submissive and pleasing to him despite all of the disrespect and unfulfillment. \n\nIt\u2019s only escalating. He sees sex workers when I\u2019m out of town for work. He hits on women in front of me. It\u2019s been 4 years and my own family doesn\u2019t know about him because I\u2019m so ashamed. I might seem together to the outside world but I\u2019m living this secret double life of stress and drama. I know the response is \u201cjust leave\u201d.  I don\u2019t know what my life looks like anymore without this in it. I feel very guilty for letting it go on so long. I feel desperate, but defeated. I spent my paycheck buying things for his new apartment this weekend, only to see him setting up a date with another woman on his phone. I threw things, I screamed, he called me a whore. I left and walked home in the rain at 3 am. He held work I had there hostage, told me he would make it hard for me and destroy it. I had to push back my deadline for my client because of this. This is because I caught HIM setting up with another woman. It\u2019s been less than 24 hours and I can feel myself already losing conviction.\n\nPart of the shame is now knowing that I haven\u2019t been perfect either, despite also knowing damn well that he would be the same whether or not I did what I did. I feel like I deserve this as long as I have this knowledge and don\u2019t make a change. I feel too gross to even discuss this to a therapist. I feel subhuman and alone.\n\nHe is a grown 42 year old man and yet I feel intense guilt and self loathing at the thought of \u201cabandoning\u201d him. I have an unhealthy level of empathy knowing his traumatic life story and feeling validated myself selfishly by helping (being used by) someone. I see the hurt little boy in him in all his actions, but I know that\u2019s not my problem. I don\u2019t know what it will take to break this cycle, but I feel like my whole life is on hold until then.  And all I hear in my head is that if I stay, I better just shut up and accept my choices. There\u2019s my public life, the tip of the iceberg visible, then this giant abscess below the surface. I am only 31 but feel exhausted and old. At least I never agreed to move in together, because I always knew. I\u2019ve never fully trusted him. It\u2019s really wild how your tolerance for abuse can be so much higher than you\u2019d like to think or claim before having experienced it. I was always \u201cI would never stay\u201d holier than thou, but never ever would I judge someone now. I am grateful I have resources to take care of myself and am not reliant on him for anything besides psychological torture.\n\nThanks in advance just for looking at this.

However, I'm seeking outside input as to whether she is a narcissist, and if so, what I can do to find peace and stability. I am so emotionally invested in this relationship that I lack clarity, and I need help identifying what is going on. Thank you in advance for your time in reading what I'm about to post, and any thoughts, suggestions, or other comments you might have.\n\nInstead of posting a list of issues with the relationship, I'm going to post a story. This is a typical \"bad night.\" After these \"bad nights\" she does not want to talk about it and it gets buried, without being resolved. I have suggested couples therapy and she refuses. I have attempted to leave the relationship when things get bad, and she gets emotional and pleads for me to stay. I feel trapped. When things are going well, I manage. However, I always feel uneasy, that her next meltdown can happen at any time. I sometimes convince myself that things are better, but the pattern never changes. Below is such an incident. Thank you for reading.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe came into my room this evening, upset. She became tearful as she told me that she is terrified her acne is coming back and that she used to be bullied for it, and she is afraid of dealing with it again. She wanted to go back on antibiotics, which she has taken previously for recurrence of her acne as an adult. I told her she could get a prescription from her primary care. She mentioned that she was on Accutane and did not want to have to go back on it. I mentioned I was on Accutane too. She immediately became upset with me and accused me of trying to one up her, of making the conversation about me. I said I was trying to show empathy for what she had gone through. I continued to reassure her that we'd deal with the acne and it wouldn't be the way it was when she was a teenager. She continued being upset about my comment, and said that it was like when she had talked to others about her acne and they would compare their mild cases to hers, not knowing how awful hers was when she was younger. I thought she was being unfair to herself and letting other people's experiences diminish what she had gone through. I tried to think of an example of how it's best to focus on your own experience, since what others have gone through can be better or worse but shouldn't take away from it. I brought up how she has a friend our age getting cancer treatment, and tried to communicate that someone can always trump our own experiences with something \"worse,\" but that doesn't take away from what we have been through.\n\nAs I was trying to explain that, she become immediately incensed and started shouting at me. She accused me of trying to invalidate her experience by saying that her friend with cancer was dealing with more. That was not my intended point at all, but I could not explain it without being shouted down repeatedly. In spite of that, she kept demanding I explain why I said that but would interrupt every explanation. I grew frustrated, told to explain myself and apologize but not given a chance to without shouts or snide comments insulting me for daring to bring up her friend. I admitted that my train of thought was stupid, that despite what I was trying to convey it would more immediately be interpreted as me trying to shoot down her concerns by comparing them to someone else's situation. I repeated that was not my intent, that I was sorry for not thinking through how she may interpret what I said. She accused me of making excuses and demanded I apologize for \"saying that \\[she\\] can't complain because she doesn't have cancer,\" even though that is not what I said and certainly not what I was thinking. I grew frustrated in turn and told her that I felt slapped down for trying to be supportive. I said that she often does this, and asks for my support but often rejects it and in turn belittles my attempt. I asked her why she acts that way, why she assumes the worst or is disrespectful. I asked why she woke me up this morning with a text asking why I had \"parked like an asshole\" and was being a \"fucking smart ass\" when I told her I didn't realize that my parking was an issue, since we were parked on the street and nobody was behind her (she had said that she had to back over the curb because the street is \"not straight\"). She did not acknowledge my question and remained angry at my earlier comment, demanding I apologize \"for real\" and that I had \"fucked up.\" She kept yelling at me, so I walked away.\n\nShe told me that I am a bad person and closed the door behind me. Calling me a bad person in that context made me lose what little cool I had left. I in turn shouted back, saying I was tired of being disrespected and called names or insulted when I was trying in good faith to be helpful. She said how dare I compare her to someone with cancer, and I walked away. I felt guilty for reacting with anger instead of walking away sooner, so I walked up to the closed door and attempted to explain myself and apologize again. She called me a \"coward\" and claimed that I couldn't even \"apologize to her face,\" although she had locked the door at that earlier moment, preventing that. I went around the side and tried to apologize face to face. I once again explained what I meant, accepting full responsibility for the example I gave and how it is my fault because it is easy to understand that she would interpret it the way she did. She called the apology \"bullshit\" and asked that I further explain my thought process for what I said. I tried to explain it calmly, and was interrupted 2 sentences in with a comment about \"You compared me to someone with cancer!\" I asked if she wanted me to explain myself, as she had requested, or would keep interrupting me. She asked that I resume and said she would not comment again until I had finished. One sentence later, she interrupted with, \"But not as bad as cancer, right?\" I lost patience at this point, told her there was no point in trying to apologize to someone who wants to fixate and be angry, and started to walk away. She accused me of being abusive, and I asked why. She said I had been \"gaslighting\" her and \"trying to break the door down,\" which I asked her to explain. She said, \"See? You're abusive!\" instead of answering my question. She then said, **\"Just fucking kill yourself\"** followed by, \"I'm canceling our upcoming trip to Europe.\" I was shocked and repulsed and walked away.\n\nI returned a moment later and asked that she not cancel our trip. She said that our relationship was over and asked me to leave. As I was walking away, she again stated, **\"Please just kill yourself.\"** She then texted me proof that she had canceled the trip, called me a bad person for my earlier comment, and once again demanded an apology. I gave up trying to explain anything, simply said she was right to be upset and it was my fault, and apologized. I then went to bed in a separate bedroom, closing the doors to my room. She came through several minutes later, accusing me of \"locking her out of her own house.\" I was confused, since I normally latch this bedroom door at night to keep our pets out. She left and I latched the door again. When she returned, she kicked the door open, breaking the latch, repeating her accusations that I had tried to lock her out. We went to her bedroom door together and it was simply jammed from her slamming it earlier. I tried to open it gently, but she kicked it open in anger and called me a \"pussy.\" I then returned to bed. She woke me up later by throwing open the side door, and threw one of the cats inside, promptly slamming the door shut after. I assume the cat was annoying her and keeping her from sleeping, as he likes to do to us.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I didn't realize until much later that he displayed almost all the traits of narcissism and that the highs and lows we were going through fit the idealization and devalue stages. During our affair we had gotten 'close' , as in I opened up to him and told him my secrets and insecurities. Through that I had actually revealed to him about a traumatic past I had and he involved his wife to help me get in to see my therapist (the wait times for other places were months so I accepted the help). In my sessions with my therapist I have spoken about the Nguy and the affair, and we helped century the unhealthy bits and help me move on a break off the affair. \n\nI recently found out by the Nguy telling me that his wife had contacted my therapist to ask her to do counseling work for her workplace and I honestly felt a little surprised and betrayed. I just thought about how my therapist knows all about the affair and now toxic things had been, as well that the wife has no clue the affair even went on. Part of me wants to find a different therapist because I personally find it weird that I talk to her now about a coworker and her husband, and she keeps that secret from her and will still work with her. Part of me also wonders if I'm over reacting and shouldn't be bothered by this. \n\nAnyone ever have a similar experience or thoughts? \n\nSide note, my therapist did admit to me she had been contacted by the wife to do work for her company, and that she did feel awkward during their meeting considering everything she knows. The concern came from she felt like the wife was trying to avoid asking about me but was obviously curious about my therapy, and had spoke about seeking counseling for her and the Nguy to which my therapist refered her to someone else.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Or like, where he doesn't rape, instead he seduces her and gets her horny through massaging or whatever, until she's horny enough that she wants sex.\n\nWhat does this have to do with abuse? Well I know for a fact that my parents are narcissistic abusers. That plus they are more old fashioned (my dad is 1st generation taiwanese, mom is 3rd gen japanese), and more ingrained in their culture, which is not really a good thing. It's the kind of culture where the father of the family is always right, you must always obey your parents, respect them, etc etc. I know that my father's parents were abused, and my father grew up severely poor, oftentimes going hungry. Also, my dad stole money as a kid from his mom, and she gave him an ultimatum: either he stops stealing or she cuts his hand off with a butcher knife. My mom used to guilt trip me with how much money she was paying for my music lessons, school, clothes, food, a roof over your head, etc. She and my dad also used to threaten to throw me out on the street a lot when I was in middleschool/highschool. It makes me wonder how much of it is narcissistic abuse, asian culture, or maybe a mixture of the two.\n\nSo it makes me wonder if my sexual tastes are influenced because of my family and upbringing. I do know that I can't help what I like, I never had a choice in picking. I'm going to absolutely keep it to myself masturbating to porn, and not forcing my tastes on other innocent people. The last thing this world needs is another abusive psychopath. I probably am at least part narcisstic, or at least some degree of it. I doubt others when they tell me they love me. I don't want to spend time with a girlfriend, instead I would rather play videogames (maybe this is normal idk). I overgive a lot then expect and get mad when others don't give back (which I feel is controlling behavior). I don't feel safe around other people.\n\nI didn't have a choice in the kind of person I became, a lot of that was decided by environment and upbringing. But I can at least make sure that I don't hurt others with any abusive tendencies I picked up from my parents. Even though I want to cry out for help, I know that probably no one cares, and that help doesn't exist for people like me. I'm pretty sure the rest of my life will be filled with pain and suffering as it has been for the last 3 decades, with probably no way out. I'm so tired of being invalidated, threatened, blamed, put down and living in perpetual fear and torment.\n\nI expect people to not care about my post, or to either hate it, blame me, criticize, invalidate, and basically be malicious towards me. Also, I live with my dad at the age of 32, because I can't hold a job for more than 2 months because interacting with people is a terrifying, draining and heartattack inducing experience.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

To summarize my fucking childhood, here are some key facts/events that happened to me;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Both of my parents are drug addicts, lost me at 10 months, more apt to call them \"strangers who enter/exit my life often\"\n2. Was raised my paternal grandparents who were EXTREMELY emotionally and then physically abusive, got kicked out @ 15\n3. Went to other gparents, also emotionally abusive.\n4. Left household as soon as I could for college, on my own now\n\nSO I'm 20 years old and I have a lot going on in my life, but I feel so unsatisfied. My life is really good rn, I just feel like I'm missing something. I attend college for social work, I'm taking care of my health, I have a couple of really good friends (although I feel like I'm not the best friends or I'm not as close to them as I should be).\n\nDecided to remodel my interior design as a way to make my home more personal and comfy to myself. Removed a lot of stuff from my diet, so I'm eating better and I have invested in a fully stocked kitchen (equipment and food lol) to make whatever I want as I experiment with recipes.\n\nI have 2 pet rabbits (who are free roam and like cats tbh) I take pretty good care of. I got them both neutered and take them to the vet annually. I have a wide range of hobbies which include; cooking, photography, PS4 (sometimes switch) gaming, car mods, music,  and reading. I want to get more involved in camping/outdoor activity, traveling of course, maybe go to the gym more often (will I though lol). I also want to get more involved in my community, I just don't know the first couple steps.\n\nI know part of my problem is that I have problems with commitment, relationships, or setting realistic goals. Sometimes I just feel overwhelmed with all the responsibilities I have (which isn't more than anyone else). More often than not I'll just abandon commitments because I don't have the motivation or energy to go through with it. More prominent examples are my classes, certain shifts at my job, or even friendships. I have so many unopened messages from snap that I have been avoiding because I just feel worse the longer I ignore it.\n\nHow do I get over my problems with making commitments? Or maintaining relationships? I know I'm feeling unsatisfied, I just don't know what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you read my post up till know, kudos to you.

We entered into a relationship when I was his subordinate, eventually he moved to a different location and I was promoted to a new role.. I endured 4 years of lying, gas lighting, abandonment and a whole other list of emotional abuse. My friends and family hated him, but I was under his spell 110%. I pushed my friends away, would drop anything or anyone to spend time with him and defended his shitty behavior.  I was told that he was in the middle of a separation when we started seeing each other, I knew things were complicated because they had a child together and I hung on his every word. I met his daughter, and we looked at houses and apartments together, we bonded over the craziest similar interests. He was my dream man, and so I put up with things not making sense, his stories were always believable.   Everything came to a head when I ended up pregnant, and confessed that he was still married, and very much WITH her still. I could not believe I had been so blind. He then proceeded to tell me that if I had said child, he was going to have to kill himself because if his wife found out, he would loose everything and he could not handle that. He accused me of cheating saying that there was no way it was his (he had actually hidden a vasectomy from me so he was \"certain\". All the while telling me he couldn't wait to start a family with me). I pulled away at this point. It was my turning point so to speak. \n\nI had spent a year trying to fix all the problems he created in my life. I literally describe it as PTSD (not to be insensitive to those who have traumatic PTSD) but really, I see habits from his \"abuse\" in my life still to this day. Therapy, meditation and surrounding myself by great people has helped tremendously. I was doing really well. I had met someone else, and I was undoing all the damage.\n\n It was almost a year since I went NC and I found out that I was going to be working at the same location as him again. I was scared shitless. I had no choice though, so I prepped as best as I could and told myself I was strong. And to start I did fine. I told him I didn't hate him but I did not think I could ever forgive what he did to me. He was still with his wife and seemed to be doing well himself. But over time, things changed. He went back to being that charmer that I first met and thought I was in love with 5 years ago, then it escalated more.  He started crying the blues about how sorry he was and how I was the one that got away. He never stopped thinking about me and his marriage is loveless, and sexless and on and on. Then he started inquiring about the guy I was seeing. Almost immediately after I filled him in on my man, he got relentlessly clingy.  He cried, he needs me, he wants me, I turn him on more than anyone. He slips in off comments about my boyfriend, trys to coerce me into sending him nudes, asks if he can touch me at work. The whole nine yards. \n\nFast forward a couple of months, he tells me his wife discovered a message from me on his phone (it was nothing bad, in fact it was work related) and she asks why he is still talking to me. He apparently spills and tells her that it has nothing to do with her, but he is in love with me still. And now they really are splitting up \ud83d\ude12(please note, I have been told similar stories to this before, most of which were fabricated to make me believe something he was selling)\n\nMy problem is- for some fucking reason I have a REALLY hard time saying no to him. I cant set boundaries. I dont want his attention, I dont want him in my life, but due to work circumstances (that I am working on changing as I fear it is my only option) its not possible right now. I have an odd attraction to him. I dont WANT him, but I am attracted to his persona, his stories, his banter and he keeps trying to hook me. I am happy in my relationship and I feel like he is planting these little seeds of doubt. He keeps telling me that it would be different this time, that he knows he fucked up. That he gets that I dont trust him and if I give him a chance he will show me. I am obviously not even considering it, but whenever I turn down an advance or request, he sulks. And for some reason I feel guilty! \n\nI have a feeling that I am subconsciously hungry for the attention that I always wanted from him when we were together. But this whole mess is starting to affect my mental health again. \n\nHow can I set the boundaries I need without causing work conflict or walking around feeling like I \"owe\" him something?\n\nAnyone else ever experience this feeling by a returning NEX?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Thank GOD I at least don't have to worry about any violence, because then he'd no longer be able to rationalize away his behavior or convince himself that he's the real victim in all of this.  *Nothing has been more freeing and helpful to me than identifying him as abusive.*  He pulls the most stereotypical bullshit out to deal with every scenario and I have just had. it. with. him.\n\nI'm in this bizzarro-world position of being able to call out abuser excuse-making, blame-shifting, goalpost-moving, and black-and-white thinking in actual real time.  His preferred form of abuse? Routinely coming home blind-drunk and berating me for hours in the middle of the night for being a terrible person while I silently cried because I had learned that trying to defend myself only made things worse.  I hid under a sheet once, not to escape his tirade, but because *it was the only way I could continue to endure it.* What made me such a terrible person?  Oh, only crippling depression.\n\nThat went on for years.  It was indisputably abusive.  He admits that he \"regrets it\" and \"yes, if I could do it all over again, I would have done things differently.\"  Tonight he complained that I keep acting like he's done nothing about it when he already spent a whole night apologizing!\n\nAbusers. Just. Do. Not. Understand. Reality.\n\nIt doesn't matter how clearly I spell things out to him, how many times I say \"it's not about having feelings, the problem is how you express them,\" how many times I try to communicate that just because you want to be helpful doesn't mean that you are actually helping.  It just goes in one ear and out the other with a bitter, world-weary laugh.  He's tried everything! He doesn't know how to talk to me! I'm a massive hypocrite and slacker!  He has to do everything around here! Oh, so you're saying that I'm not amazing?  Guess that means you're demanding that I admit to being the world's worst person!  This conversation just hit a spot that I can't figure out how to twist on you so I'm going to suddenly become all sad and tired and overwhelmed because I don't even know what you want from me.\n\nTrust me, ladies and gentlemen, you won't be able to change your abuser.  There's just too much cognitive distortion going on for any criticism to be actually internalized.  Mine is a self-avowed good guy, who's into feminism and against exploitation and goes out of his way to help people and do the right thing.  All that just means that my claims about his abusive tendencies couldn't possibly be true and if they were, it was just because he wasn't his usual self.  He won't do that specific thing again.  What do you mean that all of the evidence should have rocked his world and made him question everything he's thought about himself?  And, ugh, why does everyone keep worrying if he's on the verge of becoming violent, it's so insulting.\n\nI'm currently in a prime position to do that thing we all dream about, safely call out not only our abusers' actions but also the underlying mindset enabling them.  And I'm doing it too! Confronting him, pointing out how negative interactions could have gone positively, and pointing out the exaggerated stupidity of his passive-aggressiveness. (\"So you're saying...\" she sighed deeply, glasses off and rubbing the bridge of her nose, \"that even though you're already hand-washing the bottles every day, you're not going to wash the new toddler spoons and I will have to wash them separately, all because you're unhappy that they aren't microwave and dishwasher safe?  Seriously?\")  None of it is registering.  Nada. Zip. Zilch. Nothing.\n\nYou can't change someone else.  If they're sufficiently committed to misinterpreting everything, I think you can't convince them to want to change either.\n\n(Like, seriously.  I asked him what he was doing to address the fact that he's capable of being abusive and he deliberately zings me with \"well, I'm trying to leave an unhealthy relationship\" in a tone which clearly indicates that he finds me the toxic one.  Fast forward twenty minutes and he's trying to guilt me about telling him two weeks ago that he's going to have to move out in less than a year.

In short we started dating around this time of the year. She was in what appeared to be an abusive relationship with an over-controlling ex. She had enabled location tracking for him to watch where she was going. I urged her to break up with him after some time. The first night we spent together was where the Love bombing started. She would shower me with food, gifts, and either affection or attention.  \n\n\nEvery morning I woke up to 1-3 texts I had missed 5-7am (she works for the post office). At first I thought, \"this is just a fragile person who needs love\" but looking back I understand this is how an abusive narcissist plays their victim. Fast forward a month and we went out for her birthday. She was stealing abandoned drinks from nearby tables and trying to pull me into the restrooms for god-knows-what. I was upset and reprimanded her, but it fell on deaf ears. New Year's Eve rolls around and she slaps me in the middle of a party.\n\nI was stunned and left the party completely shaken by this sudden change. She ended up sleeping with someone that night, then started sleeping with the same person behind my back. Towards the end of January 2019, during unprotected intercourse she told me she had been cheating on me. I was heartbroken and she threatened to cut herself as I tried to walk out the door.\n\nI reached out to reddit to ask if I was going through abuse and unanimously the community agreed and warned me to keep far away. However the story doesn't end here unfortunately. What followed was more love bombing but in the form of \"No Caller ID\" spamming. She was calling me despite having blocked her number.\n\nEventually I started to have night sweats and a constant nausea that followed me daily. She would call only to insult me or my family, or talk about her new boyfriend. I was in so much pain. Eventually I started to become enraged and decided to harass her back and confront her actions. It turned into her sharing my anger with her friends and receiving their ire as well.\n\nMy intention was to scare her off by becoming undesirable and monstrous. It worked to a degree but at the cost of my sanity and self-respect. She decided to inform me last time I bumped into her at a party that she was back with the \"abusive\" ex I mentioned earlier. I hope this story gives some comfort to others going through abuse right now or in their past. This year has been fraught with so much pain and suffering, but it inspired me to create more than I ever had before.\n\nI'm happy to say that as a musician and artist I've gained the courage to finally perform at my first show doing only original work. I've collaborated with so many wonderful musicians, and started drawing as much as I can. There's a happy ending if you can make it out of the hole.

I just have to start out by saying that I've been reading stuff here for a few months, and have gotten a lot of support from what everyone has been sharing. Especially the comment sections with advice and support have been fantastic. I think it's part of why I managed to work up the courage and self respect o end things with my narc. But... I failed and didn't go NC with him. And that's where my cry for help begins here.\n\nI feel like I'm going crazy, and I need help. I fear he might find and recognize this, but I don't know what to do anymore, so I'll take the chance. \n\nI managed to break up with him two months ago. Two years of gaslighting, manipulation, and cheating. However... Like I said, I did not go NC with him... I know I should have. But I felt bad about ending things, I still loved and cared for him, and even though I've refused to get back together after, I still stuck around because I felt bad if I were to just vanish from his life. \n\nAfter that there's been multiple fights where he gets mad at me for not wanting to get back together. I've been called names, he very openly on social media started flirting with his other supplies (who all were the cause of numerous fights throughout our relationship) - then got mad at me when he later told me how much he loved me, wanted to get back together with me and how much better he would be this time around, and I reminded him of that flirting. I was told I was exaggerating, seeing things that weren't there, that he was just talking to friends and that I was insanely jealous and paranoid. \n\nNow, it's gotten to a new level, and this is where I'm starting to question my sanity. A week ago he suddenly claimed he couldn't receive my messages. I tried calling all of his numbers and was sent straight to voicemail. I also tried texting him and snapchatting him, without any results. I saw he opened my snaps, but no replies. This went on for an entire day. The next day he said that he could take a hint, told me to stop fucking with him (he claimed that Snapchat said I was typing and then deleting messages, even though I saved them in our chat). Magically, when I said my final goodbye and told him I would block him everywhere, it worked again. He told me that I had been blocking him everywhere and that nothing I had sent him had gotten through, and that he figured I had ghosted him. Which I've repeatedly said I would never do, cause I think ghosting is incredibly mean. I can tell someone \"hey this isn't working out and I'm leaving, goodbye\" (like I did in my final goodbye to him), and then leave. But I don't want to ghost anyone. He knows this very well. I screamed and cried and felt like I was back at square 1. And he was incredibly calm, almost smug. \n\nBecause of his calmness I got a hunch this was just a power play for him, to provoke a reaction from me, and get me riled up. Ever since I broke up, I've managed to not get like that, which has been annoying him like crazy. I've been called a cold and heartless bitch numerous times. \n\nLater that night, when I had calmed down and I guess he felt like he was losing control again I suddenly got a bunch of really awful messages on Snapchat. Calling me a whore, a cunt, just really awful things. I called, and he claimed he didn't know what I was talking about. He then claimed he was hacked. Yet, the most paranoid guy I know, was completely calm about it. Wasn't eager to find out who had hacked him or anything. I tried bringing it up again the next day, but still he didn't seem to care that he had apparently been hacked on Snapchat, Skype, his email, Discord and Twitter (all the places he claimed he didn't hear from me at all). Didn't seem to bother him whatsoever. \n\nAnother few days went by, we had a few talks and I thought things were calming down again. Things have been great for the past two days and I thought \"hey, maybe we'll actually work this out somehow\". Then out of nowhere, he said that he would leave me alone, said goodbye and blocked me on Twitter. I asked what was going on. Nothing. I tried calling. Nothing. I texted him on Snapchat and text. Nothing. Eventually he started saying the same things again. That I should stop jerking him around by sending stuff on Snapchat and then deleting it. I haven't done that. I started saving the chat in Snapchat, taking screens and sending it on regular text, texted him on Discord, called a few more times. He hangs up on me half the time, other times it just goes to voicemail eventually. \n\nI even got a bit annoyed by the whole thing and asked him if he had amnesia, since we throughout the week have been discussing again how I would never ghost someone, and that I found it a bit weird how he immediately went to that conclusion, instead of thinking maybe something has happened if it's true that he suddenly stops hearing from me. He has repeatedly told me he checks in on me frequently because he's worried. When I've pointed out that I find it a bit random how he only does that when I'm at parties or social gatherings around other guys, and not elsewhere, he gets mad and tells me I'm not appreciative, that I'm paranoid or that what I'm saying is simply not true. \n\nThe last update on this now is that he's typing to me on Snapchat, without sending my anything. Just so that I'll get the notification. Last one was 7 minutes ago. I don't know what to do, and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I need help. \n\nHas anyone else dealt with the same thing? I feel like I'm going crazy here. I don't want to think a person can be this manipulative. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt. I don't want to think he can be this insane. And I'm afraid that's where I fail myself. But I feel like I'm being made a fool out of, and I genuinely feel like I'm going crazy and that he's trying to make me paranoid by thinking we're both being hacked or something.

You already did.\nThat's why I was afraid to leave. You put me down more and more everyday, but too subtle to notice. You made me feel smaller and smaller everyday, barely too subtle to noticed.\n\nI notice!\nIt took me 12 years, but I notice.\nI'm going to pick up more shifts, I'm going to save up money.\nAnd I'm going to leave.\nI won't take up too much space when I sing and dance and laugh. I will make it and I will be okay.\nI'll learn to love myself. I'll learn what I like and what I want. I'll learn that other people don't pity me and they actually want to be in my company. And when I finally do, you won't be able to take that away again, cause I'll be strong then. \n\n2020 is gonna be mine. It's going to be a long road, but I was once a person who loved life and I'll find her again. You didn't kill her yet. You'll see.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

My singular priority is her wellbeing and safety. \n\nLong story short, she got really drunk and went home and a guy she knew came over. Her roommate came back to the house to find them together, and sensing red flags took her aside to check in. Don't know what was said or her state.  I didn't pry for details, but the guy ended up staying on the couch while my girlfriend went to bed. He later entered her room and raped her.\n\nFirst, I feel completely awful for her. I cannot believe this happened, and I listened to her and despite shaking with rage internally at her attacker kept a cool composure. I will continue this for her.\n\nSecond, while I will support her regardless, last time I left town about 3 months ago something similar happened. She got drunk, and ended up at her house with a guy I don't know. She let him crash on the couch since he was pretty drunk, and while I trusted her we nevertheless had a lengthy and healthy talk about boundaries. We decided we would check in with each other more if that situation arose, set some mutual boundaries, and continued on happily. \n\nWell, that situation arose again and this time while there is absolutely no causality between her decision to drink and hang out with someone she knew (fuck victim blaming forever, ok?), something completely awful happened to her. I don't know if I can get past this. I also feel awful that me being away somehow led to this. I feel angry at him for victimizing her. I feel the creep of doubt, and the questions about her decisions when she's drinking - as well as the amount she drinks - but I push that away. That's all bullshit right now. But her betrayal of this trust we established now has something far more horrific that comes with it, something that will likely affect her for years. \n\nUltimately I'm just lost, hurt, angry, remorseful and trying to support someone who I love to the best of my abilities.\n\nTl;Dr: Set boundaries with girlfriend months ago, she broke them and something unimaginably awful happened to her.

I don't know how to start this post because it's hard for me to open up especially about traumatic  relationships. So I had an ex-boyfriend, we've been in a relationship for four years. He was my first. Our relationship went smooth at first but it went downhill last year. (I am now single for 8 months now). Seriously, I really don't know what the hell happened between us. He constantly neglect me from everything. Attention, sex, communication, time, you name it. He used to put me in silent treatment. He never felt accountable for the times he wronged me. He sometimes apologized when I caught him lying, but he was never sincere. He cancelled plans without telling me. I just kept on waiting and waiting for an explanation on what just happened but I nwver received any of that. My sexual needs was always neglected, it doesn't matter to him as long as he cum already and it's DONE. He just disappears and cut communication with me, left me wondering what I did wrong. Months and months passed by, our relationship went like this until I really got fed up. I broke up with him. It's really hard to get over it until now  especially when I have a self-destructive behavior. Currently, I always get flashbacks and zoning out experience. It's hard to concentrate. I cry myself to sleep most of the time and wake up feeling empty. Sometimes, I want him back. He was the love of my life and badly want to work things out with him back then. Right now, I remain NO CONTACT with him. I hope I'll get over this. I just want to share my experience here cause I don't want to do it personally, even to my friends.

I've known about NPD a long time, my previous ex was an overt Narcissist.  When I met my now ex, I did my best to make sure he wasn't a narcissist.  In most ways, he was a caring partner for a long time.  \n\n\nBut both of his parents are Narcissists.  Father is overtly so, and a sociopath to boot.  Mother is more covert, but it's a pretty thin veneer and to me it was noticeable pretty soon after I met her.  For the early part of our relationship, ex had some contact with his father and little with his mother and sisters.  Then it went the other way, he went NC with his father and his mother and sisters moved to where we lived and they spent more time together.\n\nSo many of his closer friends have been narcissists, and I didn't want to spend much time with them.\n\nBoth of his parents have been on disability for much of their lives.  Ex had an injury 2 years into our relationship that caused health problems and he got fired from his job.  He went back to college and worked part time, which was manageable.  Then 6 years in he had a major health problem and from that point forward he's been purportedly disabled enough he couldn't work.  He did work for a few months and during that time had an affair with a coworker and majorly gaslighted me about it.\n\n9 years in he filed for Social Security disability but it's never been approved. I \"loaned\" him basic support expanses and provided all the extras.  \n\n\nDuring most of this time he was a loving if limited capability partner.  He was usually supportive and not critical.  But I do feel that he could have done some work.  His mother in particular, though, would always tell him he shouldn't take \"just a job\", it had to be something where he could \"follow his passion\" &lt;eye roll&gt;.  He was often in a lot of pain and irritable, but it didn't feel personal me.\n\nAbout 4 years ago he started hanging out with some particularly pathological narcissists.  He started picking fights and belittling and gaslighting me.  3 years ago he moved out (after living together 18 years).  We maintained a relationship, which was much better when he wasn't around so much, but he pretty much kept it a secret from his family and friends.\n\nHe has several diagnoses including brain injuries, mental illnesses, and \"pervasive personality disorder\".\n\nTo me, he doesn't meet narcissistic diagnostic criteria, but he's like a perpetual flying monkey with all these family members and friends, and he adopts their behavior when he hangs out with them.  So his family and friends generally don't like me and I'm always a handy scapegoat.  I've generally just ignored it, because I know that game, and I have my own life and friends.   \n\n\nI'm just wondering if others have experienced anything like this.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Stepdad says his actions are not defendible but he thought he and I were in a relationship and that's what made it okay, that my mom was cold towards him and since I was super happy with life, because I was a CHILD and didn't have anything to worry about, that I must have wanted it.

I met her and fell for her pretty quickly...she was witty, playful, passionate, curious and had a rare sensitivity and self-reliance that was really attractive. We had a physical and interpersonal chemistry that was incredibly exciting, conversations that lasted for hours, constant texting back and forth, amazing sex, everything. She was like no one I've ever met and I felt as safe and as seen by her as anyone has.\n\nThis petered out over about two and a half months, and gradually she became more avoidant, then cold, then outright hostile and mean-tempered. We had a falling out over a petty argument and didn't speak for five months.\n\nEventually she reached out to me one night apologizing, drunk, saying that she missed me. I had every reason to be angry with her but I had missed her terribly and was very hungry for her acceptance. We didn't talk very deeply about the tensions that drove us apart the first time - we essentially just picked up where we left off. Again, stimulating conversations, affirmations, warmth, reassurances. She's highly emotionally intelligent and communicative, very sweet, very available, and also really encouraged me to be the best version of myself.\n\nAgain, this lasted for about eight weeks before she gradually grows cold, haughty and dismissive. Again, she's baiting me into arguments over grievances that seem to be conjured out of thin air. Again, she seems to be constantly testing me, demanding that I show proof of my understanding, ultimately insisting that I don't care for her and that I see her as an object.\n\nI should also mention that even in the best of times, she was a very competitive and dominating personality with a big ego and I often felt a lot of pressure to please her, to minimize elements of myself that she might find unsavory and to recite a script of things that I thought she wanted to hear. The performative aspect intensified the more she withdrew and if anything, seemed to confirm her suspicions that I wasn't authentic and didn't really care about her.\n\nI haven't seen her in the flesh in almost a year but I'm still pretty devastated. In our arguments, I allowed myself to be gaslit into accepting her version of events because I felt so small and humiliated from constantly trying to get back in her good graces. I ultimately ended things but I felt deeply confused and shattered for a long time afterwards and engaged in a variety of self-punishing behaviors - including reaching out to her again, first to go on an angry tirade and then to proffer a hysterical and self-flagellating apology, neither of which she had much patience for.\n\nMy therapist has been great throughout this whole process, and is one of the few voices who have assured me that I wasn't stupid or mistaken for loving her as much as I did. I've been reading about Trauma Bonding at my shrink's urging, and it's been tearing me up. Although I can understand intellectually that this relationship followed this exact script - in which the Narcissist love-bombs you, and then turns on you once they feel secure of your attachment - I'm having a lot of trouble reconciling this Narcissist archetype with the playful and compassionate woman I was initially attracted to. I know in my heart that she's not an inherently malevolent person, but she definitely has some emotional damage/traumas of her own and has been super cruel when she wants to be. Even now I'm haunted by her having said \"You obviously don't care about me at all\" after a beautiful phase of mutual confidence, trust, telling me how appreciated I was, etc.\n\nI'm pretty torn up, guys. I feel like a huge loser for not moving on faster. At this point I've been grieving the relationship longer than the relationship itself actually lasted. She's become, in a way, the avatar of all my depressive spells - as if she's laid eggs in my brain and manifests to personify all of my self-loathing and inner turmoil. Sometimes I even have nightmares about her belittling me. It feels like I can't outrun this deep regret, that I won't be able to feel the same kind of excitement about other women, that I had something approximating beautiful love but I sabotaged it, and that it was only ever an illusion anyway. If anyone has any thoughts, suggestions for coping strategies, or would like to share some similar experiences, I'd really appreciate it. I'm feeling very hurt and lost right now and if we could get some other voices contributing to the conversation that'd be cool.\n\ntl;dr Had a classic Trauma/Betrayal Bond relationship that I'm having trouble healing from.

N/Ex wife and I were together for 15 years, three children together. She had three affairs while we were married, after forcing me to agree to a polyamorous relationship, the last ending our relationship (my choice) and resulting in her current marriage. She never acknowledged that her dating caused me any trauma or sadness. We\u2019ve done therapy, during the marriage and after (specialized in home therapy for our 12yo).  It\u2019s been three years since we split up and she got remarried. Her wife is young (17 years younger than I am) and we have trouble connecting on any level. She is also a narc who is verbally abusing my children and N/ex and per N/ex\u2019s report has been physical. \nOver the summer I had to enroll our 12 year old in a month long mental health day program because he had been acting out aggressively, only at their home, and N/stepmonster threatened to call the police on him. Following the day hospital we were referred for the in home family based program, where a team of therapists come to the home six hours a week. The sad thing about all of this is that the kids want a relationship with her and routinely come home after time spent at N/ex\u2019s home devastated because neither acknowledged them while they were there. I can\u2019t go to the court and have custody changed because \u201cit\u2019s not enough\u201d to terminate and the kids still wish to have a relationship. \nFast forward to this past Sunday. N/ex and I had 2 cats and a dog when we were together and when I kicked her out she left all of them in my care. One of our cats was recently diagnosed with inoperable cancer and were are just doing palliative care at this point. I had asked her to keep the cat while I went on a family vacation for a week because I didn\u2019t want her to be alone. She agreed and also agreed to check in on the other cats while we were gone. The day that I returned I received a text that the cat was doing poorly and hadn\u2019t been eating or drinking for the last few days.  She withheld this information from me until I was driving home. She also stated that she didn\u2019t wish to return the cat to me as \u201cshe was happy here and she wouldn\u2019t get the care that she needed at my home\u201d because I have other pets. She also said that she didn\u2019t believe that the cat  had much time left.  When I returned home was a mess. She had neglected to fill the water fountain for the cat 15yo male, dying cats brother, so he had no water for an undetermined amount of time. He is gated in the kitchen because he has urinary trac issues and has a tendency to pee in inappropriate places. He cannot go without water as he is a great risk of getting sick and requiring thousands of dollars of vet intervention. So know I am distraught believing that I am losing both 15yo cats, that I\u2019ve had since they were about 5 weeks old. So I text N/ex and tell her that the cat was without water for an undetermined amount of time and SURPRISE is was my fault!  She said that I had only asked her to check on him/them once during the week and clearly it wasn\u2019t her fault that he ran out of water. Now, I had her over the week before I went on vacation to show her how to fill and care for the fountain. During this discussion she spent her time mocking my housekeeping skills. I should have known them that I couldn\u2019t trust her to take care of the cats but it was the day before I was leaving and I never thought that she would neglect a cat that she had helped me save.  Again I was wrong, her inability to care for anything besides herself astounds me. When I texted her about the cat not having water she told me it was my fault because she 1. Wasn\u2019t getting paid (not true) and 2. She had gone on the day I had requested. She didn\u2019t even ask how he was until the next day. I spent the evening completely devastated because I was going to lose both cats. Thankfully, he is doing well and is passing urine without issue. It has been a stressful week worrying about him. I went to N/ex\u2019s home to pick up the other cat and surprisingly she allowed me to take her and she is also holding her own!  I then realized that N/ex totally lied to me to upset me. Sigh. She is not doing fantastically but I thought that I\u2019d be taking her to the vet to put her to sleep.  \n\nI want so much to go no contact but that is impossible with three kids with special needs, sports, and life.

I'm a 35 yo woman. When I was a child my father terrorized me, my mom and my grandmother through violence, threats and intimidation. He was in and out of prison for violent acts and drug offenses. When my mom tried to leave him he would use me as leverage, I was often kidnapped and dropped off with strangers far away from home (who knows what happened to me during these times).  He held guns up to my grandmother's head in front of me.\n\nFast forward 1990: my father marries his AA counselor, they have 2 boys (my half-brothers). My father is technically sober but is in no way in recovery. He is still the narcissistic, cruel bully he was when he was using. I was court ordered to spend weekends with him. The anxiety and fear I felt about going to his house destroyed my childhood. I suffered from severe OCD and anxiety and was suicidal by the age of 11. I was vocal about how I felt about going to his home but my mom still sent me off into the lion's den week after week. When I was at my father's house I was completely shut down and operating in survivor mode. I hardly spoke, didn't eat or sleep and started self-harming.  I lived with crippling anxiety, fear and isolation for years. I was never seen.\n\nFast forward 2007-2009: my father relapses, this time with methamphetamine.  He is actively involved in black market weapons deals and selling drugs, and then decides to change career paths and become a pimp... my father starts a relationship with a prostitute that works for him. One night he walks in on his new girlfriend (the prostitute) having sex with a John. My father ends up killing the John. He immediately enlists me and my brother's to help him cover up his crime (to hide weapons for him, help with an alibi etc) I refuse and my brother's both willingly help him, potentially implicating themselves as accomplices in the crime. He takes a plea and is sentenced to 10 years in prison.\n\nFast forward 2019: My grandmother dies in January and mom dies of an alcohol overdose 2 weeks later. My father is released from prison in July. I have had no contact with him during his incarceration, however the rest of my family has continued to offer him support throughout his sentence. I received criticism and judgement all along the way for not being supportive of him while he is incarcerated. (My grandmother even asked me to contribute financially to his defense while I was working full-time to put myself through college)\n\nMy brother gets engaged, but decides to hold off on the wedding until my father is released from prison. The wedding date is set for September 21 2019.  I RSVP that I will be attending with my boyfriend. The anxiety begins to mount about a month out knowing that my father will be at the wedding. I request to at least not be seated at a table with him and my request is denied, but I feel like maybe I'll be able to show up and just ignore him. The day of the wedding my boyfriend and I pull into the parking lot and I have (what I think was) a massive panic attack. (I've never had one before). I begin hyperventilating, pouring sweat and trembling. There is no way I can walk into that wedding venue. I have never felt anything like what I experienced in that parking lot, and I suffered the rest of the day because of the guilt of not being able to show up.\n\nSo I don't go to the wedding. I reach out to my brother and sister-in-law explaining what happened in a very honest and vulnerable way. I tell them both how much I wanted to be there but that I just couldn't do it. I tell them I hope that we can move forward and that me missing the wedding wont negate all of the other ways I have shown up for them. Instead of understanding I am met with cruelty. My brother calls me pathetic and selfish, tells me I need to \"stop acting like a victim\"  that he's \"sick of the poor me shit and my issues with dad and the family\" to \"get over it\" that it's \"not all about me\" and to \"figure my shit out and grow up\". My family continues to support and rally behind my abusive, violent, narcissistic father over me. Its unbelievably hurtful. I have received such little support from my family even after the death of my mother earlier this year which, in part due to the nature of her death (overdose) has made the grief unbelievably complicated and traumatic. I don't expect my family to understand how I feel about my father because they didn't share the early childhood trauma with me, but I do hope to not be called names and to be treated with an ounce of compassion and basic decency. I guess I'm crazy for wanting that.\n\nI don't know how to approach my brother about his behavior towards me. I know his feelings are hurt that I wasn't at his wedding. Do I  attempt to try to mend a relationship with him so I can have contact with my niece? Do I do go for no contact and see if he'll eventually reach out?  It's hard for me to set strong boundaries with my family because I feel so lonely after the death of my mother and grandmother. I have a network of support outside of my family, but I don't want to cut ties with my family completely. I know I can't change my brother's behavior, or the behavior of the rest of my family, but I also feel the need to express to him how hurt I am by his name calling and insensitivity but I don't know how. I so desperately want the trauma I experienced at the hands of my father to be validated. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

We have an age gap, she's 26, I'm 49. When we started our relationship, she didn't want kids, and we seemed very well matched. From the beginning of our relationship she would make small demands, nothing outrageous, like asking if I would dye my hair. Then she demanded I not speak to my ex-wife, even though we have kids together. She wanted me to unfollow my ex on all social media. Then when i would not, she would break-up with me because I was not putting her first or respecting her. I would give in to certain degrees and we would get back together. This cycle would continue every few months and the demands got bigger. We would breakup, and I would cave in to her demands. Leave the job that I love so I can support her and our future, not talk to my coworkers because their advise was flawed and they are supposed degenerates, ect. Then she decided that she needed a child. And I caved. Her most outrageous demand was that I change my last name because she didn't want to share a name with my ex-wife. During our relationship we broke up and reconciled at least eleven times. During some of the last break ups she would do things that she knew would wound me, and tell me she was justified in doing so.

I was in a weird headspace because I got out of a traumatic relationship and my heart was broke.

However, I had seen red flags and at the time, I didn\u2019t have the best boundaries and I really didn\u2019t even know about boundaries and my lack of them. I have always wanted to believe the best in people. Like that there is good in everyone sometimes it\u2019s just forgotten or not fostered. I suppressed my observations and thought wow, he\u2019s a geek but at least he is a hard working man. I thought he was obsessed with me like he acted like the first year... but now I know it was just because he was wasted. I needed someone to love me in a way I didn\u2019t allow before. I was done with the \u201cbad boy\u201d the bad boys were bad news and thought he was responsible and going to protect me. Then we broke up after a year of weirdness.  I was done and I was happy to be on my own, independent and in my own house, with my own career, my own car, my own friendships. He was increasingly controlling and increasingly possessive. I didn\u2019t think he was evil. I thought, complicated, Rigid, cheap, and very materialistic but I didn\u2019t think violent or damaging.  Then two weeks later I find out, I\u2019m pregnant. \u201c are you kidding me?\u201d  I think wow this is a sign from God... I\u2019m not sure what this is but I wasn\u2019t going to abort the child. We slowly got back together, I moved in.. that\u2019s when he got crazy. I guess I just don\u2019t know how I married someone who never loved me from the beginning. I pretended we were perfect. I was terrified to let anyone know how much he actually hated me. I was ashamed he treated me so poorly after I was fighting for our child who was high risk and had such a high risk for still birth. I fought for my sons life using my gut that led me to know he needed me to protect him everyone wanted me to be happy, they seen me burned. I put on happy faces because I didn\u2019t want to disappoint people and it\u2019s so awkward to tell. I also thought it I praised him when he did nice things in front of people, maybe he would try to be nicer. He hates me. I still love him.

I think he didn\u2019t get the Love I wish I could give him. I still pray for him but know he would Kill me if he could at this point. I\u2019m sad for him.

We have very similar personalities and it was very obvious that I was his favorite child. I didn't have as close of a relationship with my mother, and our relationship through the years was very turbulent until recently. My relationship with my mom is pretty good right now, though I'm terrified of it getting back to where it was. \n\nBut things with my dad are worse than ever. As he's getting older, he's getting grumpier and less patient. He hates his job, and complains about every thing that doesn't go his way. He vents and lets out his frustrations on us, and will frequently get snappy when we voice a different opinion. I can never tell him how it makes me feel because he instantly turns it on me, or says how hes just gonna not talk to anyone anymore, just shut up forever. It's not just me that he does this to, but since we are still somewhat close I have to be around it a lot. My sister and mother have also expressed being upset by him often, and when we try to sit down to talk to him about it, he feels we are \"ganging up on him.\"\n\nMy dad used to be a very empathetic, loving, caring person. But the anger towards his job, my brother, traffic, his relationship with my mother, and the dogs, gets put out on mainly me. I'm sick of being his sponge. And if I'm not paying good enough attention to his complaints he gets angry at me, again guilt tripping me, and telling me that \"I pay more attention to my phone so he should just shut up.\"\n\nMy mother is better in terms of not letting out her frustrations on us, but she usually just bottles things up until she explodes, which can be very scary. I have triggering memories of her screaming at me as a child when I did something wrong, of crying until I felt like I was gonna throw up. And how I never meant to hurt my mother, but she didn't understand that, so it must've been my fault. My mother never paid me as much attention as my brother and sister, we have very different personalities so for a long time she didn't really know how to get to know me. She treated me like a child well into my teens, and other times would get very mad for seemingly no reason. She herself was physically and verbally abused as a child, and she tried really hard not to be like that, but it's very obvious that some of her behaviors are from her childhood abuse. And bringing that up with her has bad consequences. \n\nMy mother and my father both have EXTREMELY bad road rage. Not to the point of running someone off the road, or getting out of their car to fight, but they yell and get very angry whenever someone is a jackass in traffic. Which is all. The. Time. And even though I know they're not getting mad at me I still find myself getting scared as if they were yelling at me. It's so bad that I can't hear someone say the words \"God damnit\" without straight up crying. \n\nI (20 ftm) am a very sensitive person, and have been struggling with anxiety, adhd, and depression since my teen years, and my parents love to hold this over me. About how hard it is for them to deal with me, and whenever I'm having a hard time they ask me if I \"want to get better.\" Like I'm not trying hard enough. When my anxiety started in my early teens, my parents seemed like they would be supportive and understanding, took me to therapy, were ready to help me. But whenever I was upset they would get angry. And soon I came to associate my feelings with being a burden. And soon after that, just my existence as a burden. I feel I should be grateful it's not worse than it is, that they mostly accept me for who I am and are there for me every once in a while. \n\nI feel like I have to tiptoe around my parents. I have to constantly act how they want, act like everything is okay. I have to listen to my dad and agree with everything he says, be attentive, be grateful, don't ask for much. I have to do the chores before my mom sees them piling up so she doesnt scream at me like she did when things were bad. I also have a bad trigger to the sounds of dishes clinking, because of how my mom would angrily do the dishes and then scream at me for not helping enough. It's been a couple years since then but I am still terrified of when she is mad at me. \n\nMy parents have never been physically abusive save for spanking me a couple times in my early childhood. Somewhat recently my dad threw a handful of ice at me in anger, which was very scary. And my dad constantly calls me annoying, loud, and hard to be around (because of my adhd, but then that's just an \"excuse\").\n\nI'm tired of being the punching bag. I want to be able to have a relationship with my parents and not have to tiptoe around everything. My parents are good people, and I can't help but feel guilty even thinking of them as abusive. They like to remind me how much better I have it than others, and how I \"forget the good things they do, and focus on the bad.\" I don't think I do, because I'm very grateful to everything they do right, I'm just done putting up with the wrong. Just because theyre fine sometimes doesn't mean they aren't also abusive others. I'm just so tired of hating myself because of them.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

For the first few years I think I was stuck in this young new mom- new wife mentality and I completely disregarded the signs that he didn\u2019t have the same heart as I do. But we had always had this weird magnetic bond between us, hence the fact that I\u2019ve been with him this long. I never really diagnosed it but the last 6 years or so have been nothing short of hard and miserable. \n\nI could give you story after story of the abuse he\u2019s put me through, mainly mental.

English is not my first language. \n\nTriggerwarning: suicide, violence, abuse, rape, drugs and addiction\n\nI am a 25 year old male. My childhood was not the best. I it was governed by the abscence, beating, mental abuse and gaslighting through them. I struggled with mental issues since i can rember. At the age of 6 i entered school, the bullying (even through teachers) and beating by other schoolkids left deep scars. I fell into depression at the age of \\~8 i had sucidial thoughts . Somehow i manged to survive these 4 years.\n\nAt the age of 12 i was raped in a camp by another boy. My depression got worse, to the point i was commited to hospital, i was unable to walk without severe pain. They found nothing so it was psychosmatic; and they sent me to a therapist. The years went by and i started to cut myself. I do not know how i managed to go on for this time.   \n Every morning i struggled to leave my bed, and if i had the energy to do i had to force myself not to end it. 2009 was my first year in a psychiatric hospital, i commited myself. Until now i have spent more then 3 \u00bd years in psychiatirc hospitals and rehab.  \n  At the age of 18 i started to smoke weed, this was the slow beginning of my addiction. 2013 i tryed to kill myself fort he first time. 2015 was the year i started to smoke pot regularly. At the end oft he year 2015 i got a prescribtion for oxycodone for migraine (no other med has shown tow help). This was the breaking point of my addiction. I started to use regularly everything i liked to try. I was looking for the things i was missing and tried to satisfy it with drugs.   \n Mid 2016 i was on a party drugged myself almost out of it. I was raped by a transwoman, i was unable to give any consent.   \n 2017 i tried again to kill myself. Beginning this year in march i went to rehab and i am currently still in it. I am sober fort he longest time in years. I feel the feelings and needs i supressed / satisfied with their help. I am diagnosed with a less severe form of BPS, polytoxicomania (addiction to multiple drugs), depression, ptsd and avoiding anxciety disorder.\n\nWhy this wall of text? Now we comes the part where i need your adivce. \n\nI met a woman pre rehab. She is a survior of abuse too. She has BPS and is still in the process of dealing with the selfhurt. We started to phone regularly and kind of connected. But sometimes i feel like she is not honest and tells storys (that she says happend the day we phone or few days ago) that sound pretty made up.   \n I realy like her, but i dont want to hurt her or me. I am afraid to fall in love, expierence to be left again. I am afraid of beeing close to a woman. I still feel dirty and unwanted. I have severe problems with my self-esteam. She got more flirty over the last 2 weeks. Last weekend she invited herself over to my appartment when i am finished rehab (will happen next week). She says she finds me atrractive, especialy my big heart and empathy. She said clearly that she wants to go down. I have no idea how to proceed.   \n   \n \n\nI feel overwhelmed with how close she wants to be, on the same note i am afraid of beeing close but i crave closenes.   \n Do you have any tips for me?\n\nEdit: I have thought about what I am concretely afraid about. It is being manipulated into an emotional abusive relationship. She knows that I am sexually frustrated due to me always blocking myself. And know I am afraid that she will use this to coerse me into things I don't want.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Is it really emotional abuse if it's a pattern during fights? She can be dismissive and not super respectful otherwise but fights are where the ugly came out. She's even tried to be better I think.

Something about the way he said it made me feel uncomfortable but i apologized for bothering him and asked him to just call me later on.\n\nI went home, went to bed and still no call from him.

Because of her job, he moved across the country several years ago. (Just like me, she was groomed to be married to a narcissist. So, even though she's great and he's a total deadbeat... she is in his trap and has not seen through it.)  \n\n\nHe still has our kids for maybe a month or month-and-a-half per year (during school breaks and holidays). Our kids are now 18 and 15. They both have high IQs and are emotionally sound... and have been through just the 'right' amount of abuse to make them true empaths.  \n\n\nMy kids could not see him more differently... and there's good reason. My son is my nex's 'golden child' and my daughter is his 'scapegoat.'   \n\n\nIn my son's eyes, his dad is great. Maybe he's made some mistakes here and there... but most of the bad things that have happened to him have been bad fortune or because certain people have been out to get him. My son and my nex have all the same interests (all 3 of us have very geeky interests), so they spend all of their time that they're together playing video games, seeing Marvel movies, going to concerts...  \n\n\nMy daughter, 15, realized independently that her dad is a narcissist and came to talk to me about it this past year. She loves her dad, but she also hates him. When they're together, my nex complains that my daughter doesn't want to spend enough time with him. When she points out that she isn't geeky, and isn't interested in doing geeky things, he pouts. Or yells at her and tells her she's not appreciative because the concert tickets he bought (to a concert she doesn't want to see, but he and her brother do) cost $$$. If he pouts or yells at her, she either hides more or tells him that he's being unreasonable (and will even suggest activities they could do together that \\*she'd\\* like). If she hides more, it gets worse. If she calls him out on his behavior, her step-mom (a flying monkey) comes and yells at her, too. They tell her that she's unappreciative of all the money they spend on her (for plane tickets, for concert tickets, for clothes, for child support...) and that she has a 'bad attitude.' They tell her she's being a bratty teenager. He'll tell her that she reminds him of me...  \n\n\nAnd, the thing is, she's 15. She can be a bratty teenager. But right now it's the main excuse he uses as to why he's the victim. He's always the victim.  \n\n\nI want to protect both of them.   \n\n\nI want my son to see that 1.) his dad is a liar, 2.) his dad treats him and his sister very differently (he will take his dad's side over his sister's side 90% of the time)... I want these things not just because it would be easier on me (it would), but because... if my son ever has a girlfriend or anything that takes his attention from my ex... my ex is going to break his heart. (Even though they live half the country away from each other, they text all day long, frequently talk on the phone, and also play cooperative video games together.) My son is actually a very innocent flying monkey/golden child in all of this. I don't want him to go through what I went through when he learns the truth of his dad. (If he ever does. And I pray he does because my nex is so manipulative of him even from across the country.)  \n\n\nAnd my daughter... well, my nex is breaking her heart over and over again. Because she feels unloved.

It stopped when my mom met my step dad and we moved in with him, i was about 10. Basically that is all the memories i had about my childhood, there is some good memories too but not a lot.\n\nAs a teenager, i abused a lot of alcohol and some drugs(i died one time), and avoided all the family meetings i could, and they happened at least once a week until 5 years ago, when my grandparents died(they owned the house where everyone lived and where the meetings would occur). My mom always told me that i was being an asshole because i was the only one that would not go, i kinda of agreed with her because most of my family is really nice, and i would not go more because it always made me feel uncomfortable to be around them, and angry sometimes. \n\nSo when i was about eighteen i moved out of my home cause of a fight i had with my step dad. Until this point my life was basically shit, i never  connected with almost anyone, i had one girlfriend that was killed when someone stole her dads car, so i was really in a dark place most of my life, after that i didn't dated again for some time, I did all that party stuff, get fucked up a lot, slept with some girls, but there was never more to it. \n\nThe thing is after i moved out i didn't talked to my family almost never, i visited my mom sometimes. That when things started to change, i found a job i really like, i  didn't stop drinking, but i got it under control, i have made really good friends, that i still keep in touch regularly, i met a girl and we lived together for some time, she won a scholarship on another country and had to move out, but that was not a problem for me, i was actually really happy for her because she wanted it for a long time, we don't keep in touch anymore, but i always wish everything turns out the way she wants to. First time i was really happy, i mean completely happy, there were bad days, but there will always be, for everyone. i lived like that for some years. \n\nThen things went bad, i had a job that needs some specific tools(expensive), and they were stolen, twice. so i had no money, no job, i sold everything in the apartment to pay the bills, so i didn't have to go and ask for help to my family, i was sleeping at the floor for two months, than i had to move back to my mom house, until i could save some money(my mom is living in the house that all my family lived, just her and my uncle. Then all came back the drinking the anger, and we have been arguments for the 2 months i am living here. So yesterday we started discussing a lot, she says that i always had been given anything that i wanted(that isn't a lie), and that she doesn't get it why i am so distant from all my family and why I am in a bad mood all the time, and that my life has been a cake walk. so i told her about my cousin and what happened, and she just looks at me and say \" everybody knows it happened, that's a normal thing, it happens,  this  happened before in this family, get over yourself\". \n\nSo I have been here for two months, and i saved the money i needed, bought the tools i need, made a financial plan to never get in this situation again.  But i still have a lot of resentment for my family specially after my mom told those things to me, so i thinking that i am moving out next week, and i will never speak to my family again, being around them makes me feel bad, now more than ever, and really angry, this is not healthy, they are not bad people, but i think they have problems that i cant solve, even if i tried. And that makes me sad, like, to never talk to them again, and that i will always be the a\\*\\*\\*ole of the family, specially because if i asked for financial help, or them to do something for me, they probably would do it. But i cant live like this anymore, i cant be happy around them. What are you're thoughts on this ?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I have always stuck up for myself. I have never had problems setting strict boundaries at work and in relationships. Ah, until my Narc appeared in my life. I met her walking into a grocery store. She smiled at me, I smiled back --- but then the instant I followed her through the electric doors? **Whammo**. The most intense physical response I have ever experienced upon encountering another human being, even in bed at the height of sexual passion, and this woman was several feet away.\n\nI was in a long-term relationship, but things had gotten stale. So I felt absolutely compelled to get this beautiful woman's number. And I could see when she gave it to me that she had experienced a similar jolt --- which only reinforced my sense that two soul mates had suddenly found each other in this difficult, chaotic world.\n\nYou know what happened next. Extraordinary love bombing, one that lasted years, far longer than what seems average. But then ever so gradually the devaluation began, so subtly that I didn't even notice it at first.  And then, when the constant volatility, the criticisms, the inability to talk out issues, the refusal to accept blame for anything big or small all became standard --- amid some brief periods of re-idealization --- I was in too deep to escape before all the agonizing pain that ensued. \n\nWhy? Why did I persist in believing that the mask was real, that the loving gorgeous woman in the grocery store was authentic? It was because she alone had cast away from me that vague but dreadful sense of **emptiness** that had always been with me amid all my successes in business and with people.  That nagging chronic feeling of disconnection from the self, that queasy restlessness in quiet moments that makes relaxing hard, that is so distracting that it becomes impossible to concentrate for long or even to enjoy a film without its recurrence. (I know now through my therapy that this sense of malaise is a product of the emotional abandonment I endured throughout my childhood, even from infancy, and it is as old as I am. It has never not been with me).\n\nWell my Narc erased this emptiness for me. Just driving to her place --- even when she was treating me abysmally --- gave me a sense of vitality. (\"Maybe she'll be in a good mood, maybe she'll be glad to see me.\" Even the doubt was stimulating!) And I'm ashamed to say how many years it took me before I understood why this feeling was present. \n\n*It was present because whenever I was near her, regardless of her mood or cruelty, I felt complete. She was my shadow-self, she was my wound, she represented the prospect of wholeness to me. She took away at least for a moment or two or three that life-long emptiness that had never stopped dogging me. She was my grand illusion.*\n\nIt comes down to this: I saw her as my salvation, even when she was at her most abusive. Until at last I didn't.\n\nAnd that's the good news I wish to bring to all today. With therapy and time and support and loving friends and places like this sub, I escaped this awful heart-lock I was put in, both at the beginning of my life and now toward its latter stages. There is a wonderful life to be lived when healing at its most basic, fundamental level is genuinely sought. The universe will meet you more than halfway --- I am living proof of it. \n\nBlessings to everyone.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I haven't exactly been in a lot of healthy romantic (actually, out of the three relationships I've been in, *none* of them have been healthy). But after a year or so without being in a relationship, I thought I was ready again. I think I was too trusting of him and what he wanted to do. I met him at an LGBT+ youth group I go to and he seemed sorta charming. Actually, no he didn't. He seemed very focused on himself and I knew that right away. He asked to meet up outside of the group and I agreed. I don't have many friends (especially not IRL) and I wanted some.\n\nWe met up at a bookstore and he admitted that he had a crush on me. I was... hesitant. I didn't know him- it had barely been a week since we had met. I told him I'll think about it. He gave me a necklace as a gift at the end of our meeting and I felt sort of... giddy, I guess. The idea of someone having a crush on me seemed refreshing after so long. \n\nHe invited me on a date, so we could get to know each other. Again, I was hesitant. In the two relationships I had had before that, I had known the person for at least a few months before even considering romantic attraction. This was very sudden for me. Yet, I went and it was okay.\n\nWe talked online. That's where things got weird. He was insisted that we could roleplay NSFW things. He eventually convinced me to write an NSFW story for him and I was super uncomfortable while doing that. I didn't tell him that, though, especially not when he said he... that he got off to it. I felt like it would be rude to say that it was not arousing to me at all.\n\nWithin the next few weeks, he would pressure me to talk about sexual stuff with him and when I finally spoke up and said I wasn't comfortable with it, he said he wasn't to blame for being a \"typical teenage male\". I didn't have the courage to say that you should not let your *erection* led you through conversations. When I had a sleepover at his house, he pressured me into kissing him (my first kiss). I was really, really uncomfortable and later that night, in the guest room at midnight, I cried myself to sleep.\n\nI tried to make it seem like it was okay. He seemed happy and I wanted to make him happy, so I tried to continue. He kissed me multiple times. On another meeting at his house, he had me lay down so he could lick and kiss my cheek/ear. It made me feel really, really bad. I eventually told my mom about kissing and how I didn't want to and she *called* him on his phone, telling him he needed to respect my boundaries.\n\nHe continued to not, even after telling my mom how sorry he was and that he would \"never do it again\". He continued to press me for sexual things, including asking me what my kinks were and if I prefer to top or bottom. It made me very, very uncomfortable.\n\nI'm broken up with him now, but it still makes me panic and cringe when I think about it. Along with all the things he did sexually, he also told me that he would \"finacally support the both of us\" if I chose to do what I've wanted to do for a job since I was in second grade: Be a librarian. He would tell me I sounded horrible and should stop trying when I attempted to sing and play ukulele for him. He also consistently tried to convert me to his religion after I shared with him that I didn't particularly belong to one religion or another.\n\nSo like... I know he was shitty, but would the above qualify as sexual abuse and/on assault? I honestly... don't know?? Thank you for anything you have to say.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

We were friends first. I thought he was very sweet and seemed to have his shit together. Without going through the whole back story, to cut a long story short I was struck like lightening to the fact that he was a covert narcissist and I was absolutely destroyed for months after. Would you believe we were only together for a month before it blew up and I woke up to him, yet it took months and months to recover. I was an anxious mess the whole time and as you might expect, it was so subtle I couldn't place why. He would often make subtle digs that were supposed to be compliments and would always talk about how fantastic he was and how no one gave him enough of a chance to see how talented and skilled he was (in his career). I went no contact for a long time but I didn't block him. I started to heal and he moved on to another woman and I was dating someone else. I felt more comfortable with boundaries so we got back in contact and went back to being friends which was fine to begin with. \n\nI could be here forever to give examples of his behavior, but fast forward to now: He landed his dream job, he broke up with his partner and he has been visiting me a lot more. He's had a lot of his own stress personally but has enjoyed the new job.  I've been super vulnerable and  I've been dealing with a lot of stress related to extended family. So we have both supported each other with our stresses. It didn't occur to me until recently that I've been hooked in yet again. Only because he's been upping the anti, talking about moving in together to have a better rental. He's been staying over a lot when he's not working (he lives in a different town for work). I've enjoyed the company and the whole time I've kept the knowledge that he's nacissistic to myself as it's pointless to tell him and it would only come across as an insult. So I guess I've had to have an emotional awareness and boundary. This issue is....I've allowed him in and I even offered him a key to make it easier for when he visits. I feel physically a bit sick now as I've let my guard down and whilst we have not been intimate we have been affectionate (hugs).

He complained so much about me wearing makeup to work that I stopped yet he still accuses me of trying to impress other men every time I put even a small amount on. He criticizes everything I wear and everything I do.

It\u2019s been hard, having an nfather has at times driven me nuts and made me develop daddy issues.\nMy boyfriend is nice and chill but at times I can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s also a narcissist in his own way. \nHe\u2019s very sweet when he wants to but I sometimes he can be a handful. For instance, we\u2019ve never added each other on social media (stupid I know), when I first travelled to see him at the new city he started living and working in he had a hysterical moment on the phone when I was in the airport because he didn\u2019t want his work colleagues to see me or meet me. He\u2019s always said he was against talking about himself completely and he is pretty much an introverted person who is mostly quiet. At times he can be pretty demanding in terms of attention, he has a lot of doubts and worries and needs almost constant reassurance. I\u2019ll tell you this, we are all insecure but after a while we always somehow land on our feet and survive somehow, he just keeps being doubtful and pretty negative. It can be emotionally draining somewhat and even his business partner thinks he has a negative outlook on things overall. \nHe insisted to meet my parents, and when I asked him about his parents he was hesitant. He eventually introduced them to me without telling them that I was coming (he\u2019s that type of person lol) but I was still disappointed in him because he talked about meeting our respective parents and in the end I had to chase him about it. \nWe\u2019ve been together for a year now and it has been great overall, I feel and like the vibe but lately I\u2019m starting to wonder if he\u2019s not a narcissist or if I\u2019m just deeply worried I\u2019ll end up with a younger version of my father. \nWe haven\u2019t meet each other\u2019s friends at the moment, I will give him credit and say that he has told intimate friends of his about me. He\u2019s also a very good cook and likes to do things for me from time to time. \nUltimately, he decides something unless I insist lol he\u2019s very orderly in his own way and sometimes I do find stuff in my house put back the way he would do it or if I want to go somewhere, like the beach, and he\u2019s not fully convinced he\u2019ll somewhat manage to change the plan. \nHe does spend a consistent proportion of his time looking at what the world we are in and has a catastrophic outlook on it. He\u2019s not totally wrong but it\u2019s stuff that you alone cannot change either, so ultimately not useful. He also spends a lot of time analysing himself, like he\u2019ll ask me if I find him more anti-social or shy. \nHe\u2019s also very new age. An example is him not eating red meat at all because he feels like his immune system is overworked and that his ears burn. But if he\u2019s sick he\u2019ll refuse any form of logical explanation (got a cold? You didn\u2019t wear enough clothes in the cold, but for him it\u2019s because you ate a certain food that affected the immune system). \nPlease bear with me, I really do love him and have a great time with him overall. I guess I\u2019m just afraid I\u2019ll end up with nfather 2.0. \nI apologise in advance if this is super long and twisted.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My son is 11 almost 12 and my daughter is 10. Their father is a narcissist sociopath with antisocial personality disorder. Our divorce was official 12/21/18 I filed a motion for sole/sole after dining out he was being charged with 3 more accounts of assault in the 4th. He is currently on probation for an assault in the 4th and a gun charge. He keeps going to jail and getting out. I have an order of protection against him; this is the third renewal. I think that about sums up the information.... my son is following on his fathers footsteps.. I see lore and more narcopath behaviors and it\u2019s getting bad. My daughter has emotional issues and struggles at the moment. She is recovering from admitting she was raped by the son of their dads girlfriend. In a nut shell my kids are toxic and don\u2019t know how to behave or interact in a healthy manner as siblings at all. We are going to counseling and therapy and the school is helping as much as they can too. My boyfriend recently moved in due to the VA denying a home he was trying to buy. The plan is that we will buy a house next fall. Our relationship is so healthy and normal... almost two and a half years we have been together. Slowly grow together. He has seen my entire divorce and motion to modify and know my kids very well and we all have blended so beautifully. He shared with me last night was the first time he dreaded coming home due to the way my kids treat me. They are beyond disrespectful. He and I both agree my kids well-being is top priority and he is willing to help me in any way. Being a positive male influence and show them how a woman should be treated and things like that. He discussed he might find an apartment to lease until my kids are old enough to move out. I find this so not okay... he simply doesn\u2019t like the fact they won\u2019t stop fighting and arguing. They are so rude. We all(my family and his includes) know my kids have seen hell and been through way too much. Time will heal them and being finally free from the constant abuse of their father is what is in the plate now but their dysfunction is costing us a positive person.... what parenting tips for angry kids do you have? They literally have no respect at all for me. ZERO... and they can\u2019t be grounded all the time.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We moved really quickly in our relationship, talking about marriage and kids within 6 months. We decided to try for kids sooner rather than later because she has health issues that would soon make it (nearly)impossible for her to have kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy first big red flag was after a big fight with her, a friend suggested I tell her we give ourselves some space(not a break, just not spending every night together for a little bit). I took my friends advice, and told her we should have some healthy space for a little bit, and then I get a text from her telling my my firearm was still at her house and she was going to kill herself with it. I turned around and went to talk her down and get my gun back. We talked and she said she wouldn't actually kill herself, she just needed to get me to talk to her because according to her my friend was just trying to split us apart. I overlooked this, even though in hindsight I should've ended things there and then.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that things were happy and dandy, and we were back to planning moving in together and trying for kids. I had a couple close friends and family express concern about her behavior that they could see(manipulation, putting me down, belittling) but I brushed them off and made excuses(like the fact that she was recoving from her abusive mother) and said things would get better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe started isolating me, guilting me for going out with friends when she was home alone, pitting me against the friends who expressed concern about her behavior. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this year, I felt so lonely hardly seeing friends that when my new job had a few back to back work dinners I was ecstatic to go by myself to be social with people. But me going to both of these dinners resulted in fights, and guilt trips for me being out. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI slowly started getting out more, despite the guilt she would make me feel after. Reconnecting with friends was like a breath of fresh air, but it came with more frequent and intense fights at home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe would try to keep me from going, and if I refused we would fight. She would tell me I don't care about her or our relationship, and that I was causing these fights by refusing to stay home. It got to the point that I would go close myself in the bathroom to get away from her and try to think clearly, but she started forcing her way in to make sure I knew that by going out I was choosing to hurt her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt didn't get physical until one night I was going out on my birthday despite her protests(after having a nice dinner with her out for a few hours) and she grabbed my arm to pull me back so I would listen to her. I told her not to touch me, she let go but she still followed me out to the car and blocked me from closing the car door until I told her I would consider staying home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this and researching about emotional abuse, and talking to the friends who warned me about her early on, I decided enough was enough and told her we needed to break up. Mind you at this point we are not married, but do have a toddler together.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe expressed concern that she could be abusive since she knew what that was like from her mother abusing her. She said she would work on stopping those behaviors and go to therapy, and so far she has been committed to doing so(it's been a few weeks)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo keep or son's day normal I agreed to move into our spare room, especially since we have another 10 months on our lease.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also agreed to not take anything off the table, but that I didn't see a future for us beyond coparents.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few days ago we got on the topic of sex, and one thing lead to another as they say. I felt like a connection sparked, and maybe there could be a future with her, but just yesterday I felt my depression come on stronger than ever, and I felt like it was because I felt like we were starting to get back together. When I think about spending the rest of my life with her, it leaves me with a feeling of being stuck and sad.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd now I'm just feeling confused. Part of me feels like I should give it my all to rebuild the relationship, and part of me says that her progress is too little too late. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts or advice would be appreciated,  and I can fill in any holes I left out in the comments, I didn't want to make the post too long.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I then also read about narcs reaching out and trying to \"hoover\" us back.\n\nThen how am I different from that if one day I decide I am so fed up with everything that I just leave with little to no explanation and then stay NC forever. I am doing exactly the same actions - suddenly leaving and then pretending the narc in my life never existed. Sure the small difference could be that I am not planning to search for a new supply right away, I am perfectly fine to just be alone for a while healing my wounds and rebuilding myself on my own. \n\nBut from each other's perspective, our actions are exactly the same. We can justify it as much as we want about leaving the abuser and feeling abused and whatnot. But so can the narc, who is used to constant attention and when the attention is not given from the supply that is readying to leave or doesn't want to play that game anymore, can perceive it as the abuse. In other words, gray rock technique is technically an abusive, borderline manipulative tactic. It's not that much different from silent treatment. \n\nWhen I look at myself, I am being manipulative, by not doing what my heart usually tells me to do - to help and always support. By being aware of my actions, by employing these techniques, I am technically manipulating my narc to behave the way I want them to behave. I am not that much different in the end.\n\nAll I know for sure is that I hate this about myself, I want to stop living these lies, hence I am so desperate to leave and never look back. Who knows if that's what narcs have in their heads as well when they leave, when the lack of attention is truly a display of living a lie and manipulation.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

(crossposted to /r/twoxchromosomes)", "author": "XXplain", "self_text": " \n\nThe relationship I'm in is great in so many ways, but it's also terrible in certain ways. It's not like anything I've ever dealt with before. I'm 31, he's 47. I can't tell if this is a communication or resolvable control issue, or if this is abusive.\n\nI've mostly been in a few polyamorous and open relationships before and also a few monogamous relationships before. I'm more familiar with the mindset of poly, but I consider myself to be pretty good at monogamy. Sometimes I can't tell if something is a standard monogamous expectation, or if it's as controlling as it feels to me. Whenever one of these issues arises, it turns into an argument that feels impossible to resolve. I've been told by my strictly monogamous sister that this relationship is too controlling. I've been told by my close, poly for about two years friend that it is unhealthy and abusive and full of red flags. He tells me any normal monogamous relationships would have these expectations and is blown away that I would question them.\n\nHe gets upset if I take too long to text or call him back, even if I'm at work, saying, you have an office job now, you aren't dealing with customers face to face, you should be able to respond quickly. He knows that my ex used to work at the yoga studio I go to (I'm the one who introduced my ex to the studio), and every time I come home from the studio more than 15 minutes after the class ends he acts suspicious. He wants us to be best friends and do everything together and hang out with each others friends together, and I think doesn't understand why I would want to hang out with them alone ever. He demanded to have my reddit username so that he could follow me, know me better, but didn't find anything positive to say about any of it, and shamed me for \\*very jokingly\\* propositioning someone 4 years ago. When we fight, it's not easily resolved, it's horrible, it scares my previously abused dog.\n\nI really can't tell if this is just something where my social skills learning curve (my counselor and I wondered if I might be on the spectrum, and I definitely was under socialized when I was growing up) along with my having less experience in monogamous relationships is contributing to communication difficulties, in addition to him coming of age before poly and open relationships were as popular as they are now, and that if we can learn to communicate and compromise better we can resolve this... or if I'm stuck in a controlling, possibly abusive relationship.\n\nWhere is the line? How do I know what my boundaries are and how do I set them? How do I address this? I love this man. We have had amazing adventures together. We have so many of the same goals and beliefs. We can have so much fun and love and sweetness together. I feel like every time we argue we have a little brick layer added between us and we're creating this wall and losing our sweetness and closeness. I want to try to have things be good, but I really can't tell if we are just hitting bumps, or if this is flat out wrong.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Telling  events in order has never been my strong suit. Tl;dr at the bottom. \n\nFor the last year, give or take, I've been seeing this guy on and off. I've posted about it here and there in the comments, but never really made a post I don't believe. \n\nSo, I met the guy I've been on and off with for over a year, he's 39 and I'm 23 (yep I know, already should have been a bit more cautious) and at first, things were great. He only had a couple insecurities and we didn't have sex for the first 2 months of the relationship because of this. \n\nHe introduced me to psychedelics and unfortunately I've developed a minor substance abuse with weed, being sober feels impossible so I'm always stoned now. He is huge into the other worlds, flat earthers, speaks in metaphors, huge stoner, and basically sets up his life using moving references. He's often compared himself to V from V for Vendetta (one of my new favorites, honestly)\n\nAnyway. Things start small. Little bits of doubt in trust because of the significant age gap and he constantly remarks about my physical attractiveness. I was always horrendously bullied and outcasted, only recent kind of blooming into a young woman and more earning the \"punk rock/hippie\" so basically an aesthetic, I'm realizing. \n\nLater things started getting worse. It turned into everyday, I was cheating, lying, screwing people all over town, you name it. I was nothing more than a stupid whore in his eyes and he made sure I knew. \n\nI'm a bit of a hardheaded person and sometimes follow my heart more than my brain and agreed to just basically living with him. That's when everything got worse. Any time I went to go see my grandmother or go for a drive to listen to music and decompress, all roughly lasted an hour or 2, I don't have a lot of energy due to my depression and that's all I can manage before dragging. \n\nWhen I'd go see gram, sometimes we would get food together or she would give me 20 bucks for gas when I was in between jobs. She's a saint, she really is I adore her more than I can say. I lost my mom when I was 15 so I make it a point to spend time with my grandmother (she just turned 72 on the 7th!) And when I would return I would be berated for hours about being with someone else or not being where I said I was (even though I was) to the point I stopped going to see my gram. \n\nWhen I'd come back from drives, apparently was sleeping with other people since it only takes an hour to do a \"run\" and I have lost all motivation to go do that now. \n\nOne time I got up earlier than him and thought \"he makes me coffee before I go to work in the morning, I'll return the favor\" and made some yummy pancakes i recently found I love playing with, and then I went to grab coffee since I prefer ice. He later took my car to get cigarettes and when he came back he was furious. We argued for over 8 hours because I had a substance on my hoodie I couldn't explain. He was dead set it was cum, from one of my many imaginary bachelors I message, and was further angry I couldn't see the substance as that, since it was chalky like paint in my opinion. Around the 8 hour mark he crouched down next to me with a smile and said \"I knew it was pancake batter half way through, we were so deep in the argument I couldn't just stop it.\" And wandered off. \n\nThe stress was so bad I had a miscarriage in this relationship for a pregnancy I didn't know about (my first pregnancy on top of it.) And I was so far in denial i convinced myself in drank too much ginger ale and that's why the bleeding wouldn't stop. I chalked the pain and emotions I felt to exhaustion, starvation, and dehydration (I stopped taking care of myself and still struggle. Ive lost all motivation) all he did was scream at me and continue to badger me until he came to my bed and forced me to accept what it was that I had gone through, just to turn his back on me the following hour and continue to put me down.\n\nHe just says \"I'm an emotional creature what can I say?\" And the only thing I can say in proud of is that I never lashed back. Never said anything out of anger. Never tried to hurt him or put him down. I always ended up on the floor begging and pleading foe the verbal, emotional, and mental abuse to stop. He'd always yell at me I'm \"too sensitive\" \n\nI no longer know what's real or what to feel. If I feel anything its wrong. If I respond calmly, he's furious and digs deeper and tries to pull all the cards, if I respond out of pain and just keep asking him \"why are you doing this? What did I do? I'm sorry.\" And just cry he yells at me. If I don't respond I \"never cared\" \"used him\" \"cheated on him\" and \"I'm selfish\" because I have no energy to even leave the bed room. I've been bed ridden for 3 days. I can't get up out of pure emotional exhaustion.  \n\n\nI learned the other day my cat has cancer and won't be making it much longer. He knows how much I adore her and how close we are. She's my best girl and I'm devastated. He said I could stay until she passes so she can pass comfortably and when the time comes to make the decision he'd be there.. \n\nI've lost all of my friends and most of my relationship with my grandmother because of this relationship. I'm so tired and scared and I feel so empty and angry all the time now. I just want to curl up and not wake up, just so long as I don't have to face any of this anymore. \n\nThere are SO many more things that have happened, but the days just blend together. \n\nAnytime I feel anything, I question if those feelings are real. \"Am I really sad? Or am I putting on an act? What if I'm not actually sad and I just want to control him?\" \"Do I have a right to be upset?\" \"Do I deserve to be upset?\" \"Is this all my fault?\"  \n\nI can't trust myself anymore. I'm so scared of everything being wrong.  I don't want to make anyone angry ever. I really just want the world to be kind and I let these behaviors carry out so long because my life has been hard, I know things can affect others and some choose to become cold to protect themselves. I could understand why he felt the need to be so mean all the time, but I think in constantly trying to understand, I lost the remainder of myself. \n\nDating sounds horrifying. I don't trust anyone anymore. I seem to constantly find myself in horrible relationships like this because I can always find a reason to why their behavior is a certain way and I try to comfort and be as patient as I'd appreciate if, for whatever reason, I took my anger to an external level that causes projection. \n\nI'm already seeing a therapist, but she's only available every couple of weeks, is there maybe something I can do in the mean time to fix myself? I'm recognizing I'm probably going to quietly move my stuff out when he goes to his dads and then move my cats... its just hard because my girl that is going to pass, is miserable at my grams because the other two cats there bully her and she gets trapped in my room. I figured I'd I just endured the attacks from him long enough for her maybe that's the least I could do... but I don't know if it's an option anymore and I'm so scared to handle her on my own. I don't know what to do  \n\nIf you made it this far and could actually keep up, all I can say is thank you foe taking the time. It means a lot to me. I feel really lonely and can only find comfort recently from my subreddits since he doesn't know how to use reddit.\n\n\nTl;dr: have been seeing a man on/off for a year, excessive verbal attacks have taken their toll, I'm stuck and I don't know how to make life better for my cat or me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don't want to upset anyone, so I wanted to add a warning just in case. It's also *very* long. \n\n\nI've been out about 3.5 weeks. I feel better than I have in years. I still journal a lot. I have a lot to process. I write about situations I see through a different lens now, or how something done or said gaslit me, or I jot down memories to remind myself how awful he was. I am also lucky enough to have his last 2 big blow-ups recorded on audio (including the following exchange), so that is a huge help for any time I start to think that maybe I'm the crazy one. \n\n\nThis is just a personal story. Someone else's post here today made me think about the night I left, so I wrote it all down in my journal with my thoughts about it. And after writing it down and reading over it, and remembering how weak I was in this \"relationship\" and all the crap I didn't bring up and all the screaming I endured silently for fear of attack or punishment, I have to say I am DAMN proud of myself for how this went down! I was strong, I held on like a bad-ass, and I finally stopped falling for the gaslighting and lies. And by his reactions to a lot of it, he was completely blindsided and obviously wasn't as smart as he thought he was. \n\n\nI wanted to share the best bits here. I want to share it because I'm super proud of myself. Idk if it will help someone else or not, but at the very least I hope it reminds everyone how strong we all are, either for getting away or staying away. And to remind everyone how weak the narcs really are... it does not take much to outdo them. Don't build them up in your mind, that's what they want. They are nothing but weakness in disguise! \n\n\nIf you feel like reading it, here are the good parts ( ... indicates places I've cut stuff out):\n\n\n... He starts screaming at my daughter for being \"rude\" even though I was sitting right there for the whole exchange. So I calmly called him out on it. I interrupted him and said, \"Why are you screaming at her?\" First, he tried to tell me it was fine and it was a misunderstanding and he wasn't mad and so there was no reason for me to get angry. I responded, \"Then why are you still shouting at her, and now at me?\" That made him angrier, and he said she answered him with \"a tone.\" (For someone who denied us any feelings or reactions based on his own \"tone\" and called us crazy and paranoid, he sure loved to accuse us of \"tone.\")\u00a0 ... \"There was no tone,\" I shot back, \"She purposely responded quietly and calmly to not give you any reason to go off on her, and yet here you are doing it anyway.\" He tried to change the subject and started yelling at me for \"accusing him\" of being this horrible guy (spoiler: he was). ... My response was, \"Okay. But you still haven't told me why you were screaming at my daughter.\" He tried \"tone\" again, and I calmly said, \"Except I was right here. There was no tone. So it must be something else. Which is....?\" Now he was losing it bc this wasn't going as he planned. He said, \"You didn't see the nasty look she gave me!\" He thought he had me again. I dodged it with, \"You didn't say anything about a look before. You said it was totally cool and a misunderstanding. So which is it? Why wouldn't you just say she gave you a look in the first place? It sounds like you're making it up now.\" (obv he was.) Apparently this was it for him, after a few questions he completely lost his mind. He started shouting, \"When?! When?!\" (Or maybe \"win?\" I really don't know.) Just shouting it over and over. And I was saying, \"What? What are you talking about?\" Any time I started to say something he shouted \"When!\" again. He literally devolved into nonsense when he was confronted with his bullshit. He kept shouting it as he went to hide in the bedroom.\u00a0...\n\n\n... At this point someone in my support system called to see what was going on and make sure we were okay and confirm we were leaving, and I told them that he had left and I didn't know when he would be back. ... When he came back I happened to still be on the phone with this person. So instead of coming back in and screaming and threatening me like he always did (he loved to threaten to kick me out... but that wasn't going to work this time), he saw I was on the phone and immediately switched to 'good guy who doesn't understand what's happening' mode. He calmly said, \"Okay, let's just go in the room away from the kids and talk about this like adults. We can work this out, I don't know why you're making such a big deal about it.\" (Lol.) I get off the phone and tell him, \"Nope, I don't have anything else to say to you. I'm leaving.\" ...\n\n\n... As I'm bringing the last of my stuff out of the room, he stopped me in the bedroom doorway. ... He held the keys out again and I grabbed them but he kept hold of them. He started one of the speeches he loved to give after yelling at me for hours, all about what a nice guy he was because, for instance, he *could* be hitting me but he was able to restrain himself. So he launched into this one and said, \"You know, I almost threw these in the woods earlier. You're lucky I didn't because you wouldn't be going anywhere. It took a lot of restraint for me to not do that...\" But during this ridiculous 'I'm awesome for not being an even worse asshole' speech, he let go of the keys. I interrupted him and as I walked away, I said as condescendingly as I could (this is my favorite part), \"Congratulations. I'm very proud of you.\" THAT made him lose it again. I thought it was great. One of those moments where the right thing comes to you at the right moment and you actually get to say it!\u00a0He started screaming about how he didn't NEED congratulations from me or anyone else, he was just \"letting me know\" that he almost did that (he didn't, so...?). I tuned him out while I finished gathering my bags of stuff. ... END.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

To gain some perspective, I was the guinea pig child in a failing marriage where they decided to have another child to \"fix \" things . Then my parents divorced when i was eight.  they split when I was nine. My three year old brother and I were mostly with my biological father who either pawned us off on family members who never treated us well, was beating me around, or locked us out of the house all day while he had lady company.\n\nAnyways, this went on for a while, parents tried to patch things up and get a new apartment but things didn't work out. Beatings for me got worse as my brother learned to manipulate. Then we were pawned off to family members when my mother left and my biological father could afford rent anymore. We went to school in Stockton for about a year and a half , getting visits and phonecalls from our parents. Our father would bring food and occasionally beat me for talking back.\n\nMy mother found a boyfriend who felt sorry enough for us to help out and get us an apartment. I had so much resentment pent up towards our mother, who decided she still had authority over me after abandoning me. I wasn't having any of it and went into a rage most of my teen years.\n\nShe had enough and decided to send my brother and I across country with my stepdad. We were going from California to Virginia in an old, beaten up van with no air conditioning in the middle of July. We were taking my aunt who was expected to die any day of health complications to Virginia to see her family before she died. I have no clue why we didn't take a vehicle with air conditioning. This whole trip was a shit show.\n\nMe, my brother, my cousin who was my brothers age, and my other cousin who was like 23, and my father were all loaded into this old sketchy old Van. \n\nThe first two days were just as you would expect. Hot, muggy, miserable . Ugh it was more humid the lower south we went, we took the lowest possible route due to my aunt's heart condition .\n\nI remember looking back and seeing my cousin and little brother wiyh braindead looks on their faces. Steam coming off of them, why did they have to sit in the back with all the blankets and luggage?! I was so angry, I gave them the water I brought and ended up passing out from heat exhaustion myself. \n\nWe then stopped at a taco Bell. My biological father bought us some taco bell and I woke up having ice dumped on my face. My brother was arguing with our father about how he didn't have enough to eat. We were all hot and angry, but my biological father went fucking ape shit. Shouting at my brother about how he was a little fat pig and how ungrateful he was. \n\nThat's fucked up to tell a young boy who's self esteem was already low as it was. So I said \"Don't call your son fat. That's bullying, what kind of shit is this? This is why we don't live with you anymore. \" And that's when he smacked the shit out of me and snatched the one taco I was given out of my hands  \"well now since you want to have a big mouth, you aren't eating \" \n\nThe rest of the trip, 2 days went on and I wasn't fed. We were all too afraid of my biological father to do anything. On the third day, we finally stopped at a motel 6. My older cousin went out to grab us a pizza and saw my biological father sitting by himself in a McDonald's eating. \n\nThat's when my older cousin decided he'd drive the rest of the way. I finally got to eat, we finally got to Virginia. But the shit show wasn't over. We got there and nobody knew that my brother and I were coming, so we ended up sleeping on the floor with some blankets, food was tight because that side of the family is super poor as it was. I missed seeing my uncles and aunts. \n\nOne of these uncles had a girlfriend who's daughter was a complete nightmare. She cut the ears off of her cat with a pair of scissors and was very agressive with my brother. She was fucking SEVEN. Anyways, there was an instance where she held scissors up to my face . I was having none of it, snatched the scissors and told her mother. Who was angry AT ME! BECAUSE OF HOW I REACTED ! \n\nI said \"yo, your daughter pointed these fucking scissors at my face\" hell yeah I was panicked, she could have taken one of my eyes out ! Guess what though? I didn't get to eat dinner that night because of saying \"the f word\"  later that night I was laying on my belly texting my boyfriend at the time for comfort , laying next to a bed because it wasn't mine, I didn't feel comfortable getting on it. My aunt's all in the house come into the room I'm in and start talking. Literally about me.\n\nNow, they don't see me because I'm laying on the floor behind the bed. So they're talking hella shit.\"she doesn't give a fuck, nobody raised her. Her father's a prick what do you expect\" all that nonsense.\n\nI'm crying at this point so I get up, forgetting they didn't know i was there, and as I'm about to get out of the room and they're shouting at me for being and Eve's dropper, the house is still for a moment. I hear cries from my little cousin. My aunt with medical issues is siezing on the living room floor and paramedics are on their way. \n\nCould that night get any worse ? She was my favorite aunt who had comforted me and my brother through this bullshit. Now she's dying ? \n \nTwo mornings later, she comes back  fresh as a daisy. It was another long, depressing month before my mother could afford plane tickets for us to come home because the day that we arrived , he left because of some unknown reason. He tried to get my brother and I to come with us but I pretty much said \"fuck you, you starved and beat me I'm never getting in the car with your ass again\"  anyways yeah . Low food, lots of resentment from family, it was SHIT. I lost 25 lbs those two months and returned to my parents from a 8 hour flight, skin and bones . Just me and my brother. \n\nIt was so bad, that my parents decided to take us straight to Golden corral from the airport . \n\nI STILL avoid my father. This was like 6 years ago now.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I was always lied to and was told that I was the liar. When I would disagree I would get yelled at and told how useless I was and possibly even physically hurt (rarely, but I still remember the fear of it every time I stood up for myself).\n\nHowever, this isn't my problem.\nMy problem lies with something that was there by my side through all of this and someone that is the world to me: my sister. \n\nShe is older then me and she is loved more by my family (even though I try harder to get attention through school and art from my family then she does). \n\nHowever, she seemed to always be there when I have issues about my family or school. \nWe would usually talk about our problems and issues and would always try and be there for each other even when we ourselves were hurting. This made me grow very attached to her and makes everything that follows so much more difficult.\n\nIn the past few years it's gotten different.\n\nShe likes to joke a lot, but every day she ridicules me in some way (ugly, dumb, mean, you name it. I've heard it before.) She always says this with a straight face and occasionally laughs at me afterwards. I usually laugh along but it hurts more then she realizes. \n\nWhen I try to talk to her about it she ignores the issues and tries to verify all the things she called me. She says that I really am all the things that bother me.\nThis is where our conversation usually ends.\n\nAdditionally, she is very controlling and gets angry when things aren't done her way. She basically controls my household and everyone has to do what she says. \nNow, due to this, when I disagree with her or something she's done she gets really angry and usually gives me the silent treatment. \nThis means that I always have to apologize even though my opinion is valid. Now, she never apologizes to me even if I was affected more then her. \n\nHowever, when I try and stand my ground and not apologize she always gets her friends involved and tells them such bad things about me.\nThis then makes the friends hate me and makes me feel very lonely and isolated.\n Additonally, she always tells me how rude I am even though I try to be kind to others. She will always call me rude with her friends who then expect me to be rude. \nIn turn, I become quite vile in order to fit her agenda. This makes me really hate myself and feel worthless due to me not being able to control who I am.\n\nAdditionally, usually when I'm nice she likes to twist my words and act like I'm putting on a fake smile for others. When I tell her I'm not she just says \"uuuummmmhhhhmmmmm\". \n\nIts gotten to a point that she also does this in front of my friends (who are the complete opposite of her friends) sometimes. This then makes everything between me and them awkward and stops the conversation.\n\n\n\nNow, with that out of the way, is this abuse?\nI dont think it is, but I still want validation (thanks anxiety).\n\nAnd even if it is, I still love my sister. I dont want to leave her because I have no one else to talk to about my personal life and she's everything to me.\n\n\n\nAny advice?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

It was convenient and once I realized he didn\u2019t want an us, we just stayed companions and took care of our own lives.\n\nEnter tall, handsome, quiet, humble, country boy! Man of my dreams, wanted everything I wanted in life, had similar views on all subjects, said things that made me feel like he was the luckiest man on earth to be with me. I was happier than I\u2019d ever been, thought it was destiny.\n\nHe was down on his luck, just got laid off from his job very quickly convinced me to let him move in. Why not? This was destiny, right? Borrowing money was only the beginning. He got a job and convinced me, two weeks later, to co-sign on a truck, because his credit was crap due to his leaving his wife with nothing but the clothes on his back due to her mistreatment .\n\nTurned out his credit wasn\u2019t even good enough for me to co-sign, I had to get it in my name. Instead of the vehicle with a $250/month payment, which was what I was told before we went, he got a very nice truck for $500/month. Because even without credit or money to pay for it, he deserved a nice vehicle  Slightly concerned at this point, but he wouldn\u2019t screw me over, right? Side note: he eventually totaled the truck while driving drunk and had a $30,000 claim against my insurance.\n\nThen came the children. I am an educator so had the summers off, mind you, I have a house with a big yard and a teen still at home so it wasn\u2019t like I had nothing to do, but surely having the kids, 6 &amp; 8, stay with us all summer wouldn\u2019t be an issue, right?\n\nI dove into parenting, wife-ing, and being an all around perfect partner. As I continued to be manipulated to get credit cards for him and spend all of my savings to cover our lives, while he got on his feet. As he excused his small checks, took days off because he deserved it, and eventually took full custody of the kids, all the while saying \u201cif it\u2019s too much, let me know\u201d due to my countless efforts to let him know \u201cfull-time parenting \u201c wasn\u2019t what I wanted.\n\nNOW HE HAS ME RIGHT WHERE HE WANTS ME! He knows I will go above and beyond for his children and I felt I had no choice but to ignore the \u201cred flags\u201d for their sake. The love bombing stopped, the communication, about wants, needs, expectations, stopped. The devaluing began and the manipulation and deceit became painfully obvious.\n\nI discovered things about his past that were \u201cdeal breakers\u201d, caught him in lies, was told by him that he doesn\u2019t care about anyone but himself, among other shocking revelations. I had to file bankruptcy to get us out of the financial bind we were in, was broke, questioning my sanity, my self-worth, my every reaction. I was duped and was realizing it with great angst.\n\nWe finally separated 8 months ago. The agreed upon terms being we would be working to rebuild our relationship and my belief and his contentions, that the relationship was real for us both. 8 months of hovering, discards, stalking, devaluing, exploitation, lies, and manipulation. Luckily I\u2019ve done my research and fully understand and can predict his actions now.

On any given day I might be in a variety of mindsets and moods. \n\nI'll wake up one day happy and empowered.  I'm not going to let shit get to me today.\n\nThen the next day I'll obsess over loads of different unresolved shit from our past.  It might be when she said once that her new \"attempted\" supply was being nice to her and I wasn't, and that's why she was going to him.  When all I have ever wanted to do was love her unconditionally and support her in every way.\n\nShe chased for a new boyfriend but apparently me wanting to talk about it was me \"not being nice\".  I mean, FFS.\n\nOr maybe I'll think back to when she lied about something and I voiced my opinion about it and she got angry and gave me the silent treatment for 2 days.  Until I apologised for upsetting her.  FFS.\n\nSome days I'll obsess over a single incident and it will hurt me all over again and send me into a panic attack.  As I write this I'm feeling my heart race.\n\nThis relationship is fucked up and I read something on Quora today which really just smacked me in the face.  \n\nIt was about trauma bonds and every single point related to my experience too.  \n\nIt was something along the lines of \"You feel ashamed of yourself that you're actually continuing with the relationship even though in your heart you know that it's toxic and completely empty\"\n\nI thought to myself, what the hell am I doing?  Get a fucking grip.  I know this is wrong yet I continue?!\n\nThis is my 2nd time in this relationship.\n\nFirst time around I experienced absolutely everything that you would read about in the narcissist textbooks. I found those textbooks because of a google search some 3/4 years ago.  \n\nA little while into our relationship, after the honeymoon period, a pattern started emerging.  Normal family life shit, it didn't matter what I said. Whatever my take on a situation she would challenge it either directly or indirectly, or passive agressively.  It might be so subtle at times.  I would try and explain my views using logic and reason and if it wasn't convenient to her to accept my reasoning, she would refute it or just derail the conversation somehow.\n\nAll these terms like word salad, deflection, projection, blame shifting.  I didn't know that these were consistent characteristics of cluster b personalities.  But every single one related to my experiences during every conflict we had.  To a pathological level.  There was no resolution.\n\nThe exhaustion from discussing even the most straight forward of situations became too much to cope with.\n\nEvery single conversation that remotely resembled a conflict ended up with her going up stairs angry at me.  In hindsight I now realise that she had decided that she was going to go upstairs angry within the first second of our conversation.\n\nMe floundering around, pleading with her for clarity of her feelings and coming across as desperately searching for resoltion....I think it actually amused her.\n\nAnyway, I ended up searching on the internet why my GF was being completely impossible to resolve issues with and why I was ending up being emotionally battered for having a different opinion.\n\nThis is how I ended up here.\n\nTo cut a long story short she attempted to leave me for her new supply but it backfired and he didn't want her.  It was more an obsession on her part but her pre-occupation with him was intense.  She tried to be his emotional support to get his love, while completely ignoring my emotional needs.\n\nI have no clarity on what did or didn't happen with him because nothing was ever explained to me.  But fact is, she was obsessed with him and gaslighted me so much I went to a bad place.  She emotionally excluded me from her life and it hurt so bad.  I split up because it got too much.\n\nWe even went to counselling but she gaslighted the fucking counsellor into believing the whole emotional affair was fiction.  Then after maybe 20 hours of stressful discussions she confessed that she lied to the counsellor because she was trying to \"protect the family\". \n\nSuddenly she was a victim and I had to go with this narrative or be an arsehole.\n\nEverything was a head fuck.  I didn't know what was going on.  Her story kept changing.  The story was so important to me.  Each detail mattered so much yet I never got the answers I deserved.   The uncertaintly threw my mind into dissaray and she seemed to revel in it.\n\nEven after all these discussions I still don't know what really went on and it kills me.\n\nThat was chapter one and it was a crazy time of my life.\n\nWe were living together during all this so I found a new place and told her that we were over.  But then I went back on it and told her that maybe we could work on our relationship, even though we were living apart.\n\nWhat was I thinking!?\n\nLove is such a pain in the arse.  When you see the person you love 'suffering' it can be too much to cope with.  She is an eternal victim and I just got swept up in it. \n\nNow I know that this is how covert narcissists operate.  They play the victim.\n\nEven though it was me who made the decision to break up with her it was an absolute nightmare co-parenting with her. Everytime I saw her I got the butterflies and she would touch my arm and display confusing body language to make me think she regreted stuff and that she might actually care.\n\nShe kept pictures of us on display in her new flat as if to say that she had not given up on us, yet she didn't tell me anything about how she felt about us.  We were apart emotionally and physically yet our precious family moments still took centre stage on her mantlepiece.\n\nI spent hours wondering what was on her mind, but engaging in discussion felt impossible.\n\nI bought a holiday and invited her.  With the children.  She didn't object.  Nor did she object to us sharing a bed.  One night during the holiday I turned to hold her in my arms.  The electricity was so intense.  I put my arms around her and she took my arms and wrapped them around her.\n\nWhen we came back from the trip we were in a relationship again.\n\nNot once did we discuss our relationship starting again.  It just was.  We didn't talk about it.  I would love to have talked about our feelings and got us back on a good path again.  But I did not want to put her under pressure to enter discussions which I knew were challenging for her.\n\nShe was lovely and affectionate for 1 day.  I felt special.\n\nThat was the end of her making an effort I guess you could say.\n\nNow after 6 months I'm really starting to get it.\n\nI read on Quora about someone's relationship with a narcissist that lasted 17 years and then they realised after all that time that they were just supply.  Nothing more.\n\nThat's all I am.  \n\nYes, I'm back with her.  But what does that actually mean?  She's still emotionally distant.  I daren't challenge her on anything still.  Even little things.  I'm so aware of her ways that I'm now compliant.  I feel potential emotional difficulties for her even before they transpire as if I am walking on egg shells.  I know these egg shells so well now.  We don't discuss emotional matters.  I wouldn't go there.  I feel like a stranger to her even though we spend our limited time together playing games and hanging out.  But everything is just surface level at best.  She's more concerned with the activity on her facebook than she is with me.  I feel that she's living a double life.\n\nI don't trust her.  I doubt everything.  Her behaviour is odd.  She is so vacant on text.\n\nI tell her something about my day/life and she just responds with \"That's great babe!\".  But nothing else.  Yet we will converse for hours about the specifics of her life in great detail.\n\nIt's obvious that she is just totally the centre of everything and I have absolutely no value to her except for supply, but I know that the supply I offer her is stale to her, yet she keeps me hanging.  I wonder why she does.\n\nI know so much about this subject now that I just know that this is just a con job.\n\nI'm 40.  Imagine living this existence till I'm 50.\n\nNO FUCKING WAY!\n\nI'm done.  I don't know quite how I'm going to do it but I'm done. \n\nI don't know how I can go NC when I will be co-parenting with her.  She has ties to my mum and brothers.\n\nI don't know how things can work.\n\nBut this is slowly destroying me and I want my life back.  I love her but I realise now that I love me more and my love for her is toxic love based on a trauma bond.  She is a covert narcissist and I need out.\n\nI keep putting it off.  Maybe after haloween, maybe after Christmas.  But I need to do it now.  Because I'm now feeling like a hypocrite for feeling this way about her and not breaking it off.\n\nThis time it's for real.  I need to work out the best strategy for going LC so I can get my life back whilst minimising the impact on my kids.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The relationship had all of the hallmarks of narcissistic abuse - emotional abuse, cheating, gaslighting, triangular psychological torture, verbal abuse - eventually leading up to physical abuse. Of course, also telling me I have borderline personality disorder, that I\u2019m abusive  ... on and on. \n\nUnsurprisingly they didn\u2019t take me breaking up with them well and I ended up having to get a restraining order. It was an excruciating four hour hearing with about three of that being my testimony/cross. I haven\u2019t been sleeping or eating either because of the stalking, the hearing prep, or other effects from this relationship and end. Reliving everything was traumatizing. They and their attorney were unsurprisingly accusing me of being jaded for being dumped, being vindictive, being mentally ill. I guess they didn\u2019t realize I had 1,000s of pages of evidence, including recordings and proof they had been showing up to my house. \n\nI was awarded the order, with the judge being overwhelmingly supportive of my testimony. The judge did not find my ex credible at all. \n\nIt was a relief to hear that from a judge. I felt less delusional. \n\nBut - I found out this week he filed an appeal. The thought of another four hour hearing has drained the little emotional energy I had left. Also this week - my narcissistic mom (I know) called the cops on me because I didn\u2019t text her back within two hours. In short, I was awakened my someone knocking at my door and trying the handle - just like my ex. And then two cops - again, not the best thing for me given the circumstances. \n\nFor needed context - In the middle of our relationship I found out about an affair. It was more than an affair, though, and essentially a double life. We each thought we were in a serious, committed relationship with him. She had no idea about me, but I knew of her. I always questioned his relationship with her, but he gaslit me and made me feel horrible about me questions and arguments. (She was in another country). \nI found out because he lied about a trip and I found letters in our apartment, etc. He begged for me take him back. We went to couples\u2019 therapy. He promised to stop talking to her. (No surprise, but it didn\u2019t go anything like that). \n\nSo I guess I\u2019m just here because I\u2019m so drained and need to put all of this somewhere - because I also found out he\u2019s dating the woman he had the double life with. I expected it, honestly, but it still hurts. He spent so much time after the affair telling her and me why he chose me, how I validated all of the core things about him that she didn\u2019t, that she was abusive, that he was unhappy with her. Again, I understand it\u2019s more manipulation and he\u2019s telling her those same things about me now. But after all of the gaslighting, this revelation has caused my insecurities and self doubt to come flooding back in. I feel dumb for not being able to listen to the rational parts of me. I\u2019m so hurt. I did tell him in previous fights that would hurt me more than anything, so maybe it\u2019s calculated. But I feel very worthless right now because of everything going  on and that was the tipping point. \n\nTLDR; I\u2019m emotionally at rock bottom because my ex is dating the woman he cheated on me with while appealing the restraining order I have against him. I\u2019m wrestling with my emotions winning out over my rationality.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He gets way too annoying and aggressive sometimes (and I\u2019m sure that if I treated him better he would\u2019ve been much better).  I felt regret so often, I even posted on reddit two years ago asking for help and advice on how to stop this. But I couldn\u2019t.  \nI\u2019m in college now and I don\u2019t see him anymore.\nBut last night mom told me that he recalled one time long ago when he bought \u201cfat free\u201d milk instead full fat and I hit him and yelled at him. I couldn\u2019t remember this at first. But it hurt him so much that he remembered it merely by looking at the fat free bottle. That\u2019s just one of many- and It hurt him bad. It\u2019s very painful to think about.\nIt wasn\u2019t all like that, sometimes I would be really kind to him and we would spend good times together, but hard times were very common. \n\nThen I remembered something else that never usually crosses my mind. When I was in middle school I also used to physically and psychologically abuse my cousin. It was severe. She told her mom back then and I denied... I denied to her mom and to my mom. I think my cousin also wasn\u2019t treated nicely by her brothers. Now she seems so insecure, and is struggling socially.

I feel guilty, but I blocked his number, told my parents, and I\u2019m about to call some of my friends. Please help me stay with my decision.

I went along with it, I didn't fight it, but I was 5, you know?

They're missing that I've only interacted with him once as an adult, and he was an asshole in that instance, just like he was an asshole when we were younger before we stopped being friends and I moved onto better people.    \n\n\nMaybe this has something to do with me feeling unheard and misunderstood, huh?

It\u2019s awful. \n\nLong story short, manipulative and verbally/physically abusive ex who ruined my life, self esteem, and everything time and time again, got a plea deal over a month ago because I helped him. He promised to be better. We own a house (soon to be mine). Then after court his family and him stormed the house and had a moving truck and all that. I came home unexpectedly to see it happening. They wanted to record me??? Pulling out a phone and everything. He wouldn\u2019t speak to me. His family was so shitty. I just got out of court that morning from watching him accept a plea deal from the one time I called the police after he hurt me. I had pictures from the night and also from a year ago. Proof of physical on top of verbal abuse. Many times (it\u2019s never just one time). \n\nHe had every person we shared in common block me before I even knew what was happening and cut me off. I had no idea what was happening. I was near suicidal, confused, terrified, broken. If you can imagine. I had already went through 7 weeks of hell after the arrest and thought that everything was going to be okay.  He was convincing me to stay with him. Then that happened. \n\nAnyway, aside from everything that\u2019s happened since court, which has included isolation, me begging, him not once mentioning how he hurt me, telling me how \u201cwe\u201d were toxic and bad and he had no choice. After I saved his job as a firefighter/paramedic. (Because he has to hide behind that identity and show the world how kind and giving he is) He wouldn\u2019t have kept that job with a domestic charge.. but I helped him. Stupidly. \n\nNow, I\u2019m starting to have thoughts about this. A part of me has been trying to make sense how all these people could cut me off after he assaulted me. And the only answer I am thinking of is that he told everyone that it didn\u2019t happen. That I was unstable, I hurt myself, I got him in trouble. Knowing the kind of guy he is? He really would do anything to save his own ass. My heart is breaking right now realizing this possibility. He probably told everyone that I got him into trouble and that he didn\u2019t actually harm me, that I did it to myself, or that it was an accident. \n\nI did not do it to myself. It was not an accident. \n\nIt is killing me right now thinking of this. It explains why not once has he discussed the abuse since before court. No apology. No accountability. Just countless emails about how this is how it had to be and he had no choice, how we are bad together, how unstable we each are. Nothing about what happened. All he does is send me shitty emails concerned about getting off the mortgage. I\u2019m doing everything I can with no help from him and he only cares about getting rid of any ties from me as soon as possible. It\u2019s painful. \n\nIt\u2019s the only thing that makes sense to me. And it makes me so sad and disappointed. Like I\u2019ve been discredited. I don\u2019t get to be the victim he does. Idk.

He would open doors for me, insist on paying for everything, shower me with gifts and compliments. We dated for 3 months before we slept together and by the time we did, I was already in love with him. I felt we had built a good solid ground for a relationship.\n\nIn hindsight, there were red flags in these initial few months which I should have noticed. He threatened to end things after discovering I was wearing jewellery purchased for me by my previous boyfriend. He ignored me for a week on finding out that I had dated someone who also had also dated his sister. He then sent flowers to my work apologising. He also completely ignored me for another week, telling me that an elderly friend had passed away and it had upset him (he hadn\u2019t seen this friend for 4 years and only knew him for 2 months whilst travelling).

Not in the punishment way but in the \u2018I am not interested in talking to you way\u2019.\n\nHe\u2019d do weird things like watch ahead on a series we might be watching and then lie about it (even though I knew for sure that he had). Or he\u2019d buy himself takeaway and eat it quick before I came home from work and then burn it in the fireplace and make out he hadn\u2019t eaten anything all day.\n\nI would express how unhappy I was feeling and that I really needed some compromise from him nand some appreciation/love. He could never understand and always turned it around on me to say I was nagging.\n\nI would say \u2018do you even love me anymore?\u2019 to which he would respond \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be with you if I didn\u2019t\u2019.\n\nMy family would come up to visit (my mum came for his 50th) and he\u2019d arrange to work so he didn\u2019t have to come.  He was always reluctant to meet my family and generally didn\u2019t make the effort.\n\nHe\u2019d run me down constantly. He\u2019d tell me my hair was too long, that I was unfit (I\u2019m a 7st dancer), that my job wasn\u2019t as good as his (I\u2019m also a qualified accountant).\n\nHe\u2019d tell me that I would never leave him. That if we split up it would be him ending things.  He told me I\u2019d regret it if I did. He told me he wanted to live in Cornwall and be a stay at home dad and if I didn\u2019t want those things he\u2019d find someone else who did. \n\nHe started going to family events and friends parties/BBQs and leaving me at home. He said he spent too much time with me and that he wanted some time out. I\u2019d cry and I\u2019d cry, saying I just didn\u2019t understand, but he\u2019d never let me come. I didn\u2019t see his friends for 2 years.\n\nIn my gut, I knew I needed to leave this relationship. But somehow, I just couldn\u2019t. I decided to move out and move back in with my parents. I hoped that he would get a transfer back home soon and that we would be able to work on things.\n\nWe did long distance for a year before he came back. During this time I re-integrated with my family and friends and became happier again.  The relationship was always carried by me instigating calls/visits the whole time. \n\nWhen he moved back he moved in with his dad a couple of miles down the road.  After a couple of months, I told him I couldn\u2019t carry on with the relationship as it was. I said I needed him to show me he cared about me, be involved with my family and to include me with his friends. \n\nHe agreed and said his usual \u2018I love you otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be here\u2019 but never apologised and said I needed to stop nagging at him too. \n\nThings improved for a year and were relatively good.  We looked at buying a house together and I really felt that we were integrating into each other\u2019s lives.  In hindsight, I wonder if the only reason things felt better was because I had my parents on call so I could cope with any negativity.\n\nWe took a vacation a couple of months ago and this was the final straw. After spending a solid week together, I realised he was really bad for me.  He ran me down constantly, commented on the other woman all the time and ignored me. I suddenly realised that he was literally sucking my soul out.\n\nWhen we got back I stopped asking to see him, I wanted to figure out my next move. He made a few half attempts at seeing me and making me happy, but nothing significant.  He always wanted me to instigate a visit and would rarely outrightly ask to see me.\n\nIn the end, I told him I couldn\u2019t carry on abruptly over text in the middle of an argument. He said \u2018OK\u2019 and that was it. A few days later I felt panic sweep in and messaged to say I was sorry. He didn\u2019t want to know and told me we both needed to move on.\n\nI cannot even begin to explain the devastation I felt in the next month. I felt as though my life had no purpose, that I was ugly, worthless, unloved.  I even checked myself into A&amp;E in order to stop myself from committing suicide.  I should just point out that I am normally a healthy individual, with no history of mental health or depression.\n\nAfter 4 weeks, I turned up at his house in a mess. He told me he had met someone at work and that it was over.  He told me it was because we were too different and because my nagging made me feel bad about himself.\n\nI NEVER thought he would meet someone else that soon. He was always so loud about never mixing work with personal. He\u2019d also shown no change in behaviour in the last few months to indicate he may have been considering someone else.  I also honestly believed he had no idea that I was going to end things when I did.\n\nI asked my family/friends if they consider me to be a nag.  They all assure me I am the least naggy person they know, and that I am so easy going I am more the other way.\n\nThese last few months have been horrendous for me. I know this guy was not nice to me, and I know it is probably a good thing that it is over.  However I just keep remembering the good things, the occasional nice things he would say, and wondering whether it was all just my fault. I feel like I am not strong enough to be on my own.\n\nThe confident 23 year old I once was has been replaced by an anxiety-ridden frail 28 year old.  My friends and family are shocked at the state I am in.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Early on things with him were perfect, amazing, exciting, incredible even..The view from the pedastool he put me on was like nothing I felt before. I could do no wrong. I was perfect, his soul mate. \n\nIt began, so slowly at first, like I was imagining it. I began to ignore the little red flags that sometimes came up and so it began. Where he once raised me up, he began to shoot me down. I started making excuses for his behavior. He said or implied it was my fault, I was ashamed by it. Maybe he was right. After all, the good was so good, so maybe the bad wasn\u2019t all that bad.. was it.? Did I do something to deserve it?? Was it my fault??\n\nWhenever anyone asked if everything was ok, I just excused his behavior by telling them he was tired...or stressed...or had a tight deadline...or didn\u2019t feel well...or was still \u2018adjusting\u2019 ...or, or, or...I always made an excuse even when they could see through my disguise. But the pattern was set. \n\nThe little red flags grew and grew and have since become huge red banners with flashing lights and yet I continued to make excuses, because I loved him with every fiber of my being. Then it was not just every now and then, but almost every single day and I still made excuses because I still loved him. The silent treatments designed to keep me in line were the worst punishment, even worse than the violent rages, he would pretend I ceased to exist, sometimes days, sometimes weeks on end. The feeling of abandonment, like bad withdrawals from the drug he became for me.\n\nHe had the ability to make me feel so good, yet so bad. The intermittent rewards for when I behaved, made it feel worthwhile, and feel even worse when it was taken away, anything was better than nothing. Like a vacuum he sucked and sucked all the good parts of me and left a void to be replaced with his negative beliefs of me.\n\nThe mocking, berating, and degradation started, little things at first, \"can't you take a joke\" or \"I didn't do anything\", \"it's your issue not mine\".. whilst he was never physically violent with me, he still terrifies me. The marks he left were never visible, but real nonetheless, but they were only felt in my heart and my soul. Rarely let to heal, the scars reopened over and over for any small fight or challenge.\n\nHis words were mostly riddles, lies and half truths and but his rages were real nonetheless, until I said I believed him and he was right, let him have what he wanted. He was always right and always got what he wanted. It was easier to agree, even when I knew he was wrong. It was easier that way, easier than dealing with the punishment of saying no to him.\n\nOnce when he went to far he even said \u201csorry\u201d. \"Once\" even this was never a word in his vocabulary, So many apologies that were needed, deserved but never spoken of. I continued to make excuses because I loved him with every fiber of my being. The shame I feel. \n\nEven when it became harder to find excuses that might be believed, I still did it, I thought noone would understood how if I made a fuss, how unbearable it would become for me. How if I told the truth, I looked weak and stupid for allowing it. So I took the easy way.\n\nI lied and smiled and pretended to be be happy. The sad part is very few people saw any of this, they see the wonderful guy, the one I saw in the beginning too, then later the one I only caught glimpses of when it served him to be sweet to me. They didn't get to see the dark side of him like I did. His demons and I became roommates and best friends and then even enemies.\n\nI thought noone would understand if I told them how miserable he could make me and how I dreaded going home because I never knew which version of him would be waiting for me. I knew no one would understand how I prayed every day to get it \u201cright\u201d so he would love me again like before. I can't explain why I needed that from him.\n\nThe eggshells crumbled under my feet over and over till they were dust and my feet were broken, bleeding and raw. Only to be replaced time and again with new ones.\n\nI thought no one could ever understand why I was embarrassed and ashamed, why I couldn't admit I had misled the people who loved me the most, and why I had to keep making excuses and keep his abuse and treatment of me quiet. I had to protect him somehow, protect myself from my own shame of staying and putting up with it.\n\nBetween the gasps for air he'd either tell he loved me or he would tell me over again with his words and actions, that no one would ever love me because I was never enough, that I could do nothing right. \n\nThe very reasons he first told me he loved me became the very reasons he hated me too. I couldn't be better than him, do better than him, be smarter or funnier than him, or ever be right, so he tried his hardest to bring me down. His demons battle within him and with him to make me less than he is himself, so he could feel better about himself and his own shortcomings. \n\nA battle someone with actual emotions could never win because he is incapable of such feelings and of any empathy. Any empathy he shows is faked. My empathy was a trait he saw in me from the start. I feel everything. He used it against me..\n\nIn a rare moment many years ago he told me once he felt he didn't deserve me, that I could never love him for who he is, and that I'd leave him one-day. No matter how many times I told him over and over I loved him and that I never wanted to leave. \n\nThe times in between he could be sweet and loving, feeding me morsels, just enough small breadcrumbs to keep me hooked on him like a drug. He could do wonderful things, but there was always a price to pay. There was always a price, nothing he does is free. \n\nHe would do anything for anyone.....anyone but me that is.. I told him over and over I loved him, I promised him that no matter what I would always love him so I kept making excuses. I begged him to stop hurting me, to just stop. But he never did and yet still I loved him.\n\nI still thought I could fix him, fix his broken parts and help keep his demons at bay. If I showed him I loved him more, it wasnt enough, and instead of fixing him he broke me more and more. I've put myself back together so many times, I've lost count, numb from it all. \n\nIt was never going to be enough. I felt so empty, drained, but somehow always found more to give him. The more I tried to hide it, the more comfortable he became abusing me, knowing I would never leave him unless it was on his terms.\n\nIt was when I finally started hating myself that I knew I had to be the one to make it stop. \n\nSo I stopped making excuses. \n\nI stopped believing I was the awful names he called me. \n\nI stopped believing that I couldn\u2019t live without him. \n\nI stopped believing I was worthless. \n\nI stopped believing I was the problem. \n\nI stopped believing I was unlovable. \n\nI stopped believing the empty promises, all the forgotten apologies. \n\nI stopped believing I could \u201cfix\u201d him, he likes living in the misery of his brokenness.\n\nI stopped believing that if only I could just try harder, everything would be fine. It wasn't going to be.\n\nAnd when it all became too much and I understood who and what he really was, a covert narcissist. I knew he would destroy me, but only if I let him. It became like a fight for survival (mine not his) \n\nI realized I was worth so much more than he could ever give me. I was more than enough and stronger than he realised. I was stronger than I realised too. \n\nTo him, I will never be enough. No one will be...eventually he will find your faults and use them against you.\n\nIn his mind He has defeated me, I am no longer worthy. But he knows I see him for who he really is..a liar, a coward, a cheater, devoid of common decency. I tried giving a little less, asking for a little more. It was never going to work. I became the problem, enabling this endless cycle of crazy.\n\nI read up on everything to do with NPD and found to my absolute relief that this wasn't all my fault.\n\nHis every action ticks every box for narcissism. He is broken, was broken long before I came along, and will remain the same long after I'm gone, he doesn't want to be fixed. He enjoys being miserable, playing the victim to anyone will play his games. He doesn't know what he is, that it has a name, but he already knows he's broken, that he is flawed. \n\nHe tries to give the illusion he is better, hates me because he can longer hide the truth form me..I see who he really is now. \n\nHe's pushed and pulled me so many times, made it so I thought I could never leave, I thought he needed me, he did in his own way, at the same time daring me to go and then reeling me back when I pulled away too much, too far. \n\nTime after time I've fallen prey, believed he needed me, so I stayed despite the pain. But now I can finally see his pattern. Lovebomb, devalue, discard. The endless cycle we've lived in for years. \n\nSo I started to stand up for myself, I started making an effort for myself, with my appearance, telling him I don't like how he speaks to me, that I don't like how he treats me. He didn't like it one bit. \n\nHe knows I see him differently now, he knows I see under his mask, he cannot hide who he is from me. That scares him the most. Noone gets to see that side, the ugly truth...I've seen him for who he is, in his glory and his horror. \n\nI knew early on something wasn't right, but thought my love could fix him. He really doesn't like himself, but pretends to be better than he is, he can't admit it to anyone, who he pretends to be is not the real him. The real him is something else altogether unrecognizable.\n\nHis lies and hidden truths have become too much. His excuses. His blaming, making everything my fault, never his. \n\nHis hypocrisy is not something I can ignore anymore. His standards for me, far above the ones he him self abides. His betrayals are too much. He knows what they are, I don't need to say. But he's gone too far this time and he knows it. The denials. The games he plays are never fun, except for him. They hurt me in ways you cannot imagine, unless you have lived it.\u00a0\n\nHe is not the victim, which he plays to others. I have done him no wrong.\u00a0 I am not the crazy one, although I have been tested to within every limit of my sanity.. What others choose to believe of my version, of what I say is the truth has little or no concern to me if they believe otherwise. Many of you have been witness to bits and pieces of his abuse of me over the years and remained silent. \n\nThose that matter know the truth and know who I am. That's what matters to me. I know the truth and will not be silenced by my fears. I tell no lies anymore. I will no longer protect and enable him, it's time I stood up for me.\n\nThe last time when he said he wanted to leave, in an angry cowardly text message, Where he could not even tell to my face; in person. I lost the last bit of respect I had for him. I no longer like the person he is or the person he is trying to make me become in the process.. \n\nHe continues to pursue another, mirroring all her qualities, lovebombed and praised her, she now sits on the pedastool which was once mine. She in indebted to him, for all his good deeds and actions. She sees the sweet caring man that I was saw too. She is yet to see his true colours.\n\nI am finally at peace with my decision to let him go. I know that I deserve so much better. He is no good for me. This time I want him to go for good. My good not his..\n\nI used to write him long letters outlining all the issues and my feelings, not this time...if I do I won't send it. I'll keep it. He doesn't really care so I won't bother, I'd rather he be left wondering, not know how I truly feel. I've given him, enough of me. I no longer need his validation for closure.\n\nHe would only read the bits he wanted and invalidate everything in it, justifying why I deserved it, or how it was my fault. Because he does no wrong, is never wrong, and doesn't have to justify his actions, to the likes of me, like he expects me to do for him.\n\nHe's moving on already, has his sights set on someone else already, actually has for a long time, this was before our chapter had ended...thats what cowards do. He kept me as his backup plan. His spare.. She played a part in this. However innocent she claims to be, she's not. She knew it was more than friendship he was after, and did little to discourage him, took advantage of his 'kind' offers to help, not knowing they had strings attached. Believing his lies, that his wife was ok doing all the things he did, knowing deep down....No wife would be ok. \n\nI'll probably be thankful to her one day, because it gave me the final shove I needed to see why I need to let go this time for good. Without her, I would be stayed, cause it was easier than facing the truth.\n\nIt's ok to end a relationship you're no longer invested in. Life gets I the way, people grow apart, but it's not ok to pursue someone else while making false promises of better things to me, knowing it was just prolonging our demise. \n\nHonesty is always the best policy.\n\nI hope she knows what's in store, she won't see it coming. I didn't. I pity her as much as I pity him, perhaps more. He's older and more experienced in his dark twisted ways. \n\nRegret is not for the faint hearted, I leave with my own regrets ...firstly that I stayed far to long, enduring his torture and secondly that I should have left much much sooner. But such is life Ive gained vast insights of what I don't want in my next relationship..\n\nI don't regret loving him, this experience has made me who I am. It won't define me though. I am a better person for I know I am capable of such infinite love, something he will never be capable of or know.\n\nI am not bitter or out for any revenge on him or her. . The best revenge I will have is that I will move on and be happy, he will repeat his past mistakes over and over and may one day regret his decisions more than I ever will. \n\nI leave with the clearest of consciences, that I could not have done or given any more to him. In this case a loss is not always a loss. I gain so much more in leaving than I lose. I lose someone that doesn't care about me. \n\nI've lost others that mean so much to me and survived, so I will get past this eventually.\n\nWhilst it hurts so bad and even though I still love him, I don't like the person he is, I really need to love all of me more and finally let him go, so I can be free of his torment. The feeling of being alone while your in relationship is devastating. He's never really had my back. \n\nIt's time to repair myself, and i eventually hope to find someone who will treat me like I actually matter, who will take my broken bits and love me back together again, not try to keep me broken. Until then, I will use this time to lick my wounds.\n\nIt will take all my strength to move forward, without looking back, but I know If I deserve anything, its to be free from his chains and finally be happy again. \n\nHe has shown his true colours, which in his case are neither beautiful nor like a rainbow. \n\nIts time for me to chase my own rainbows and love and be loved again.\u2665\ufe0f", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}
{"post_id": "dgvn1o", "created_utc": 1570889491, "title": "Just trying to understand all of this", "author": "throwaway10661184", "self_text": "I'd like to preface all of this by saying that most of the time, my wife is incredibly thoughtful and considerate. However, there have been a few incidents lately that have made me wonder if I've just quietly conditioned myself to accept some things that I shouldn't.  \n\n\nShe suffers from severe anxiety, which has made it difficult to function in a lot of ways. She has trouble sleeping sometimes because she's plagued by negative thoughts, which makes it difficult for her to maintain a consistent and healthy sleep schedule. It also means she had trouble getting or keeping a job. I've more or less made my peace with that, as I make enough for us to get by. She does not want to pursue therapy or medication for it because of bad experiences she's had with both in the past. I've lightly encouraged her to get help, but I haven't pushed it for those reasons.\n\nWhen her anxiety gets bad it can cause her to lash out. Usually she lashes out at me. She'll later tell me that she wasn't mad at ME, but it doesn't feel that way in the moment. Her outbursts rarely involve any direct insults or name-calling (she has occasionally asked, \"Are you retarded?\", at something I've said), but instead just expressing extreme frustration and impatience towards me. For some reason, many of them occur in the kitchen and she'll start yelling about how I'm not doing this fast enough, or I didn't do that right, just generally being aggressive and pushy over every single thing. It's gotten that I'm anxious about cooking anything myself, for fear of her reaction if/when I screw something up.\n\nA recent example (one of the aforementioned incidents) occurred immediately after we finished making dinner. She was on her way to sit down when I guess she bumped into something (I want looking at that moment) and spilled the entire meal all over herself, some of the furniture and the rug. This sucks, of course, and she was naturally upset. I put my food down and rushed to help her get cleaned up. Every thing I did was too slow or wrong yet again. I took a paper towel and tried to wipe off some of the food she spilled on her leg. The amount of food meant it would take at least a few wipes, but as soon as I finished the first, she got on me, demanding to know what would compel me to get food on her foot (I was going in a downward motion, and like I said, I wasn't done). Eventually, I couldn't take it anymore and I did something I rarely do: I raised my voice and told her to shut up. She couldn't believe I would do that, especially when she was crying, and it didn't matter what she'd been saying to me. We later made up, and I apologized for snapping, and she \"jokingly\" said she wasn't sorry for yelling at me. That part really stuck with me. On other occasions, I could see how maybe I had screwed up in this way or that, but I really was just trying to help this time. I didn't do anything fucking wrong until I couldn't take her temper anymore. She's gone on before about how guilty it makes her feel to treat me this way sometimes, and how she can't stop herself because of her anxiety, but that doesn't square with how cavalier she was about it this time.\n\nBeyond the outbursts, I'm starting to realize how much I've become isolated from the rest of the world since I've been with her. I had a close group of friends when we first met. For the first few months of our relationship, she would complain about them here and there. Within 6 months or so, she wanted to move out of state, saying that if we didn't move we'd break up. So I went with her. We briefly returned to the home state before finalizing the move, and I wanted to hang out with my friends. She insisted on me setting a time limit, even though it was likely to be the last time I would see them for a long time. I stayed out later than I said, and this started a big argument.\n\nSince we've moved in together, I can count the number of times I've hung out with another person without her present on one hand. Recently, I got up the courage to tell her I wanted to hang out with some people from work that I've grown to like, and she became suspicious, insinuating that I was going to cheat on her (one of them is a woman, and we weren't going to be alone).\n\nThere's a similar dynamic at play here as with the outbursts. She doesn't directly insult me then, but I feel diminished and belittled all the same. She doesn't outright tell me I can't have friends (in fact she encourages me to on occasion), but the emotional minefield I have to navigate in practice to do so has made it easier to not even bother. This kind of indirect nature makes me question whether or not she's actually done anything to influence me, or if there's something off on my end.\n\nThere's something else that I should mention. Several months ago, her enraged outbursts were becoming so frequent, intense and sustained over the course of a week or so that I began to have suicidal thoughts. I just couldn't understand why someone who tells me they love me every day would make me feel like this, and I had just allowed it to happen. I dreaded coming home from work. It seemed like everything little thing I could do was wrong.\n\nI really don't know if any of this constitutes emotional abuse, or if I'm just particularly sensitive to the kinda of fights and trials couples go through. To be honest, this is the first major relationship I've been in. It wasn't hers, and she helped make me feel comfortable navigating this new territory. I wonder if maybe my naivety is what convinced me to accept certain things, like this is just part of being an adult now and I have to deal with it.\n\nI'm sorry this is so long and rambling. I just want some kind of outside perspective on all of this.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I love my parents but sometimes I remember things they\u2019ve done and it hurts so bad, but I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s just normal stuff and I\u2019m over sensitive.\nMy parents do not have a good marriage. My dad is severely depressed and has narcissistic tendencies, so he never apologizes or wants to seek out help and blames others. My mom has a really short temper and is the kind of person who refuses to take blame for the things she\u2019s done or apologize for it. My older sister has some paranoia and anxiety and has a habit of blaming me or attacking me every time she is stressed.\nBasically my parents have been playing games with each other my whole life. I occasionally wake up to them fighting or screaming at each other. When I was 12 my mom was trying to get a divorce because of something my dad did that I never found out, but she didn\u2019t go through with it. That was the worst time of my life. My dad\u2019s mom had died and he was severely depressed, and my mom and him would go into other rooms and scream at each other while my sister and I waited outside.\nMy mom used to hit me occasionally. It was never anything serious, but the time I most remember was when I was in my freshman year. I have an anxiety disorder but up until recently I used to get really bad anxiety attacks where I would freak out and cry and wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe or speak. One time I had one because I got a C- on my first essay of the year. In a panic I threw it out. When my mom found me crying and I told her what happened she hit me on the face pretty hard. I also have a vague memory of her hitting me with a vacuum cleaner when I was younger but honestly I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s real. There are other times but I was really young and don\u2019t remember.\nMy mom is always criticizing me. I have social anxiety disorder and she yells at me a lot for not making eye contact or talking loud enough. She also frequently tells me how my dad ruined her life, and then tells me I\u2019m a lot like my dad.\nMy dad raised me to never trust anyone and was emotionally unavailable for most of my childhood. He tells my family a lot about how we\u2019re poor (we\u2019re really not) to the point where apparently when I was younger I stopped eating because I thought we couldn\u2019t afford it. He guilts my sister a lot about her tuition being expensive.\nThere\u2019s more but I feel like this has already become too long. I\u2019m such a broken person and my therapist tells me my parents made their love conditional, which really resonated with em. But honestly so many people have it worse. I just don\u2019t know and it\u2019s tearing me apart to think I might be making my parents to be worse than they are.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

{"post_id": "dgy7ut", "created_utc": 1570901693, "title": "Is this abuse?", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "How do I even begin?\n\nThis might be long and it might not be, but I've tried to write this a few time and it's all been pretty long. So who knows?\n\nWell, let's start off with a brief summary.\n\nI didn't have the best childhood.\n\nI was constantly ridiculed by my family about tedious things (like my curly hair). Additionally, I was constantly yelled at and blamed for everything. I was always lied to and was told that I was the liar. When I would disagree I would get yelled at and told how useless I was and possibly even physically hurt (rarely, but I still remember the fear of it every time I stood up for myself).\n\nHowever, this isn't my problem. My problem lies with something that was there by my side through all of this and someone that is the world to me: my sister.\n\nShe is older then me and she is loved more by my family (even though I try harder to get attention through school and art from my family then she does).\n\nHowever, she seemed to always be there when I have issues about my family or school. We would usually talk about our problems and issues and would always try and be there for each other even when we ourselves were hurting. This made me grow very attached to her and makes everything that follows so much more difficult.\n\nIn the past few years it's gotten different.\n\nMy sister isnt always the best. When she's angry or upset then she isnt pleasant to be around. In the past she would usually just physically hurt me when she was angry, and I would just go along because I didn't want to make her more angry.\n\nHowever, recently it's gotten less physical and more emotional.\n\nShe likes to joke a lot, but every day she ridicules me in some way (ugly, dumb, mean, you name it. I've heard it before.) She always says this with a straight face and occasionally laughs at me afterwards. I usually laugh along but it hurts more then she realizes. She knows that this makes me feel insecure, but she does it anyway.\n\nWhen I try to talk to her about it she ignores the issues and tries to verify all the things she called me. She says that I really am all the things that bother me and make me anxious to think about. However, this is where our conversation usually ends because I don't want to make her angry.\n\nAdditionally, she is very controlling and gets angry when things aren't done her way. She basically controls my household and everyone has to do what she says. Now, due to this, when I disagree with her or something she's done she gets really angry and usually gives me the silent treatment. This means that I always have to apologize even though my opinion is valid. Now, she never apologizes to me even if I was affected more then her.\n\nHowever, when I try and stand my ground and not apologize she always gets her friends involved and tells them such bad things about me. This then makes the friends hate me and makes me feel very lonely and isolated. Additonally, she always tells me how rude I am even though I try to be kind to others. She will always call me rude with her friends who then expect me to be rude. In turn, I become quite vile in order to fit her agenda. This makes me really hate myself and feel worthless due to me not being able to control who I am.\n\nUsually when I'm nice she likes to twist my words and act like I'm putting on a fake smile for others. When I tell her I'm not she just says \"uuuummmmhhhhmmmmm\".\n\nIts gotten to a point that she also does this in front of my friends (who are the complete opposite of her friends) sometimes. This then makes everything between me and them awkward and stops the conversation.\n\nNow, that's about it. However, I kinda want time put it into context with a story. \n\nLast year I was on a social media app. Now, this app was mainly about messaging people from different countries and learning a new language. This meant that talking to someone you don't know was common.\n\nNow, I used this app a lot and I talk about it with my sister. I told her all of these amazing stories about the people that I talked to on the app. She didn't seem to care at the time and joked that I was actually making friends.\n\nHowever, one day I got a message by another person I don't know. We talked for a bit, but our conversation went dry and we stopped talking.\n\nAbout a month later they messaged me again and we started chatting. They seemed rather nice but they didn't understand their language that well. I was kinda confused at this but I ignored the red flags.\n\nWell, after awhile they got creepy. The person did a complete switch in the middle of the conversation. They told me my full name and repeatedly told me how I was going to die and how ugly and stupid I was. I was shaking and I'm pretty sure I had the worse panic attack that I've ever had.\n\nWell, my flight or fight response kicked in and I left the conversation and asked my sister what I needed to do while I was crying and shaking. \n\n***She laughed.*** \n\nShe said that she was the person and was just laughing at me. \n\nI tried to laugh to but that laugh gave way to sobbing uncontrollably.\n\nI was so angry and sad that I had to leave. However, she just followed me and mocked me for not realizing that it was her. \n\nIn the end, I apologized to her for being so emotional and dumb. She reluctantly accepted my apology and occasionally brings up the story to show how dumb I am.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, is this abuse? I don't think it is, since most siblings seem to be this way.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I explained to her I snapped because of the love bombing, leading me on, discarding me and hoovering me four times within the year, on top telling me she loved me while sleeping with other men. She also triangulated me, and would keep swinging between me and her ex. I told her it\u2019s not fair to lead me on every time the ex misbehaves. \n\nTo be fair we were \u201csingle\u201d at the time she told me she loved me, but it still felt gross to hear it when she was sleeping around. She called me crazy and unfair for being concerned about it, and trying to \u201cruin\u201d her nights out because I was uncomfortable with what she was doing.

Eventually she started calling me psycho because she didn\u2019t act \u201chow I wanted.\u201d I told her I was just feeling disrespected and she couldn\u2019t handle it, she asked for space and now we\u2019re not talking. \n\nI don\u2019t think she was expecting me to go through with it, because I\u2019ve ALWAYS been obsessed with her.

I just hate how she treated me. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve ruined future possibilities for love because I\u2019ll be looking for that \u201cintensity\u201d with someone, where that intensity is generated through gaslighting and mistreatment.

I dwell on it less as time passes.  I don't forget about it, but it isn't always at the front of my mind.  \n\n\nThe relationship lasted five years, although we broke up so many times during those five years that I wonder what the real \"number\" is-the amount of time we were actually \"together.\"  I saw most of my friends go from single life, to relationships, to marriage, and now kids...and here I am, alone, no husband or kids, having wasted so much time trying to make my life work with him.  Still, I would much rather be where I am now than divorced, possibly struggling over custody-which is where I would have been if I hadn't finally ended it for good.  \n\n\nEveryone seems to think I'm \"all better\" now, and almost no one talks about him unless I bring him up (which I rarely do).  They all disliked him during the relationship and were so frustrated with me for not leaving sooner.  They're educated, sophisticated, loving people, but they'd never been in a relationship like this one.  They don't understand how I can still love him and miss him, even though I know he hurt me.  I can't say abused me, because he was never as awful or controlling as most of the abusers people experience.    \n\n\nI grew up in an incredibly loving home.  I still have an incredibly loving family.  I hve close, deep, and wonderful friendships.  I'm well-educated, well-employed, and independent.  I work in a career that means a lot to me and that allows me to help kids who are the victim of abuse.  I know I am so lucky to have all of this, and I'm so lucky that I got out.  \n\n\nI always told myself I wouldn't stay for a second if a man ever hit me.  I never learned about emotional abuse.  I never learned the warning signs, and it took a long time to admit to myself that it was emotional abuse, and even longer to figure out that I couldn't change him.  No matter what I did.  \n\n\nWhen I doubt whether it was emotional abuse, or tell myself it wasn't that bad, I think back to the countless stories that pop right up and remind me that it **was** emotional abuse and it **was** that bad.  One of the best: he told me (more than once) that he didn't believe in apologizing and would get angry at me when I asked for one because the only purpose it served was for me to make him feel guilty.  The only possible reason I could want an apology was because I wanted him to feel bad. And \"poof,\" I was the bad guy because I wanted him to feel bad, and whatever he had done to prompt the request for the apology was quickly forgotten.  \n\n\nI'm two years out, and I'm sitting in the house he was supposed to move into with me, still crying about him.  But I'm out.  And no matter how long it takes to find a healthy relationship,  I know it's worth being out to give myself that chance.  I stay strong.  \n\n\nIf you're thinking about getting out, know that you are strong and you can.  Know that it won't be easy and you won't feel better right away; that it might take months, or years, or you may never really feel \"better.\"  But know that you're **worth it**.  You don't deserve to feel this way anymore.  You don't have to feel that awful, nagging feeling at the bottom of your stomach when you're around him anymore.  I can't promise that you'll find someone else or that you'll end up in a healthy relationship, but I can promise you'll feel better even on your own than you feel with him.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

And on Friday things really went down...\n\nT: \\*walks into his room holding my bottle he had stolen for the past couple month\\* \n\nme: \\*walks into his room\\* hey thats my bottle\n\nT: \\*drops the bottle full of juice on the ground\\* \\*yells\\* LOOK WHAT YOU DID\n\nwhen I saw the look on his face I ran out of the room but didn't get so far when punched me in the face and punched me onto the wall. I headed to the door and when I was halfway out he closed it on my leg and hand and pressed against the door while I was screaming my lungs out in pain (side not he had screws sticking out of the door so they were impaling me) when he finally released I fell back onto the corner of the wall outside his room. When tanner opened the door he grabbed me punched me again and then threw me on my table, my head hitting the corner and just left me there. My mom came to see what was going on and saw me with my face shoved into a table (my legs were paralyzed for some reason so I couldn't move) and my brother started to tell her how I WAS the on attacking him. Mom walked into my room and started yelling at me so loud all I heard was ringing. She yelled at me to get up and I could do was cry so she kept yelling. When Ronnie came in (we share a room) he started mocking me for \"overreacting\" and started watching super loud videos while my mom was just screaming and all of that made me almost faint. after that I couldn't feel my legs for the rest of the day. At that point it kinda slipped that Tanner had been beating me up once or twice a week at school and people started asking about it until our nurse asked me about it and I told her everything...After countless stories about Tanner the nurse decided it was time to call child services (she didn't advise me so I was confused) I got back home and my mom was asking Ronnie if he was the one who called child services and when she saw me she was furious.\n\nM: your the one who called child services right? I know it was you! whats wrong with you! \n\nMe: the nurse probably called...and hey where are they?\n\nM: I sent them back cause your just overreacting \n\nI was furious but all I could do was cry she said and I quote: you dont know what real abuse is, there are people who punched in the face until they bleed and dont complain about it Tanner is just playing!\n\nMe:  AND THATS WRONG, JUST BECAUSE MY BONES ARENT BROKEN DOSENT MEAN IT ISNT ABUSE I WAS HURT AND AM HURT IN HAVE BEEN FOR SO LONG\n\nafter that incident my Tanner was furious but couldn't do anything since he knew that if he did child services would take action so he lied to my dad and grandpa and told them stories about how I called CS because I was abusing him and instigating, SD believed him but jiddo did not, he saw the look in my brother's eyes he knew it was a sham so he took my side and defended me...\n\nRonnie took this whole situation as his advantage. He started sucking to Tanner whenever he got the chance and Tanner loved it so they kinda became a team. So whenever Ronnie was angry at me, jealous or just annoyed he would order Tanner to \"beat me up\" and in delight he did....every...single...time. Jiddo confronted Tanner upfront and eversincme the physical abuse stopped but the emotional abuse peaked\n\nAfter that I developed  an even more intense anxiety disorder, ill let you know about any updates.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It was going okay until I remembered that I had to give her my school photos I received from school on Friday,So I gave them to her and walked away to continue cleaning my room. After about three minutes she yells at me to come back to the kitchen, there she was holding my photos and was yelling at me why I wore just a plain sweatshirt to picture day I was confused why she was mad so I say why is that a big issue. Well apparently wearing a sweatshirt makes me look dirty and ugly and I needed to get retakes as soon as I could I calmly told her that retakes where a week ago so we couldn\u2019t get new photos, after hearing that she gets really fn mad and grabs my arms and started punching me, now that got me pissed off because for years she used to hit me and bruise me while verbally talking me down.\nSo when she started hitting me I kept on pushing not to hit me or I will call the police  well she continued to hit me and even smacked me on the side of the head so I ran back into my room and closed the door behind me. But she came in close behind me, so once we where in my room she was verbally attacking me telling me that I can\u2019t live here anymore and to pack my bags (and all of this over a school photo). At this point I was done with her bs so I did  start packing my bags I took my Xbox and it\u2019s accessories into my red suitcase and then started to put in my laptop ,the hallway door was open so she peeked in and saw that I was packing my gaming laptop. She really really hated that I play video games she blames everything that is bad in life to video games so she comes in and starts to shout \u201cHAND OVER THAT NOW!\u201d. In my head I\u2019m thinking she is going to break my laptop  because over the years she had broken three of my Xbox-es out of anger,so I refuse to give it to her so she tried pulling me and hitting me away from the computer, I was so furious I was like a time bomb so when she full on started to try to throw me to the ground I involuntarily do a shove and she falls like I just knocked her out it seemed very fake she falls into my closet door breaking it slightly then she runs off. At this point I was crying and just wanted to leave and after I heard her on the phone talking about me I was so furious, she was telling my grandparents that she was just talking to me about the photos and I randomly shoved her into my closet.After hearing that I had just deprived to I called 911 the dispatcher called my local sheriff and he drove over to my apartment. When he arrived I was crying on my bed while my mom went out to speak to him (my apartment walls are very thin so I could here every word they where saying).My mother acts like it\u2019s the jolly-est day and was telling the same story to the officers that she did my grandparents that she barely hit me and I full on shoved her in the closet so they offered to take me to juvy and without speaking to me.so when they finally talked to me they told me if I lay a finer on my mother again i would go to jail. And after that whole thing my mother came in to talk me down and blame it on my on the \u201cpush\u201d and takes my items that I packed. And now I have to have a therapist not her.

I won't bore you with all the gory details, but since getting out early this year, I have lived alone and tried to get on with my life. However, every now and then, the side effects of my experience with him raise their ugly head. I've had anxiety attacks and insomnia and am definitely not the same happy-go-lucky person I was when I met him.\nHis hallmark appears to be leaching onto women who he uses for career experience and social advancement. When I met him, I had a promising career ahead of me which he happily broke down within a few short years.\nI discovered tonight that the pattern is still in full play and he's moved onto a girl who by the looks of things has an accomplished career. The strange thing was how I reacted when I found out this information: I have no issue with the girl, no issue with him (I mean, fuck that guy, right?), and I certainly didn't burst into tears and cry myself into a frenzy. Instead,  even though my head is fine, my stomach is in complete knots and I feel like I'm going to be sick.\nAgain, I'm not upset he's moved on, my life is fine and I'm happy alone, but I've been in physical knots all evening.\nMy question is, after you left your own narc relationship, did any of you have any after effects, and if so, how long did they last? Did they go away with time, or did they need therapy and conscious effort to subside?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don\u2019t know how this could have happened, did he change his privacy settings? Get a hold of my new number somehow (I changed my phone number )?no way there is no way he knows my new number \n\nAnyways I don\u2019t know why he did this, something in me tells me he just wants to show off his new life (he once said when I broke NC one time over the year \u201c do you even know what my life is like ??\u201d Trying to brag..) he told me to stay way and how he loves his new supply and that I\u2019m insane and sociopathic ...

I had no idea why she was upset cause I literally took one step into the house and already somehow messed something up. I kept asking what I did wrong for her to say, \u201cyou know what.\u201d Than we have to leave for a meeting which I was being forced to sit in.

I\u2019m overwhelmed at this point, and I literally don\u2019t know what to say. It felt like \n\nI forgot how to talk cause of how stressed out I am and how freaked out I\u2019m feeling. Than she smacked me in the arm, snapping me out of it by freaking me out more. I start crying to be let out of car. She tells me when after the meeting, we\u2019ll go home and pack up to leave. I start begging to pull over the car and I\u2019ll call someone to pick me up. I start sobbing to let me graduate and stay with my friends. My phone fell out of my pocket when trying to get away from her, making her reach over to try and grab it from me. I grab back for it cause I don\u2019t want her to take away my only thing of security in case things got worse.

She starts to tell me how I\u2019m ruining her life, how I\u2019m the problem go everything. How she wants to kill herself because she believes of how fucking miserable I\u2019ve made her. Whenever I try to talk, she screams at me to shut up and how she was close to beating the shit out of me.\n\nAfter what felt like forever, we get to the parking lot for the meeting. She tells me to get my shit together before leaving the car. I had to shit through a 2 hour meeting pretending everything was okay. After it, she acted like nothing happened. She forced me to go clothes shopping to get me new stuff.  I appreciate the new sweaters but it was just fucking strange how she does this thing. Whenever we get into a fight, the ending results go like this:\n1) She freaks out at me for defending myself and leaves the argument, telling me to fuck myself.\n2) She acts like nothing happened and tries to be like \u201coh we\u2019re going to have fun\u201d by either getting me things or taking me to the movies or something.\n3) I run which results in a silent treatment when I come back. After around 6 hours, she starts the fight again by coming into my room and yelling at me. Than tells me I started the fight.\n\nI didn\u2019t tell anyone about that fight cause I was scared. This is my first time talking about it.\n\n\nThe reasoning for me venting is because we got into another fight today. Reason for this fight? I forgot to talk to my grandpa about helping pay the rent cause I\u2019m sick and my memory is fuzzy.\n\nShe starts screaming at me for it. I\u2019m confused because I forgot to talk to him about it and even than, I thought he already about it. I told her I\u2019ll call him back and talk to him about it. It turns into her connecting this to everything wrong with me and how I\u2019m a massive screw up. Eventually she screams at me to get the fuck out of her room, resulting me to run out and going into the room. I start to set up on how to talk to him about the rent, not sure what to say exactly cause my memory fails me when stressed and especially when I\u2019m sick. I awkwardly go back into my mom\u2019s room, asking if the amount of money was correct or not so I don\u2019t give him the wrong information. She flips her shit for me not remembering. \n\nI end up going outside in the freezing cold to call him, not feeling comfortable talking on the phone being in the house. He tells me over the phone that he was just planning on sending the rent money to help us at the end of month. I go back to the house, I clean, take a shower, and go back to my room. I start setting up to for some art to try to calm myself down when she barges back into my room.\n\nShe starts screaming at me about getting my shit together. Back to the typical questions of \u201cwhy are you such a asshole\u201d and such. This time she\u2019s insulting and mocking me more. Calling me a pathetic spoiled brat. Telling me how I\u2019m not going to make it anywhere in life. How I\u2019m just like all of her shitty ex boyfriends cause I treat her like shit. How maybe if she left me on the streets, I would learn something. I start telling her I\u2019ll step up, I won\u2019t mess up again. I\u2019ll try to get a job (I\u2019ve been trying to months but struggling to get hired) and how I\u2019ll get over my driving anxiety. She tells me I\u2019m not going to do it and how I\u2019m just making excuses. Eventually she starts threatening to ban me from everything. Art, internet, friends, everything. Threatening to break everything in my room and telling me to shut up and that sorry means nothing. At this point, the argument is just repeating itself. Just adding more things that\u2019s wrong with me if anything. \n\nAt one point, I fuck up. I say something that makes her snap. She starts screeching, slamming my door, screaming at me to fuck myself.\n\nNow I\u2019m sitting in my room, scared and unsure what to do.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

During that time she did act generally manipulative towards everyone, but it was a little different with me since we were so close. She lied constantly. Her problems usually trumped mine so we talked about hers, mainly, instead. She blamed me for things I had little responsibility for, so that she didnt have to assume responsibility. She tried to isolate me from everybody else so that she was the only one there for me; after, I was afraid that she would leave me so I seldom let her know my real feelings and instead acted like wht she did/said was fine because I feared her reaction. She implied/threatened that she would hurt herself if I left, so I was too afraid to leave. She guilt tripped often. She was cold or completely ignored me and used the silent treatment (instead of sharing what was wrong), to show me she was upset or to \"punish\" me in a way. She was demeaning at times and \"jokingly\" called me names. \n\n\nTheres a lot that lies in between but I guess that's basically the gist: just a lot of lying, subtle threats and blaming, trying and succeeding at isolating me from everyone else, withholding affection, stuff like that. But honestly aside from that, she really was such a good friend.\n\nAs I type it out, I feel like i'm just blowing it out of proportion and that it's just typical girl/best friend drama and i'm just being dramatic (Duh. I cant even be abused by my friend, my peer, right?) My husband, when I asked him about it, says he would constitute it as emotional abuse but I think I'm just blowing things way out of proportion and that it was just a normal best friend thing, probably. I'm just upset that I still have such an emotional reaction to her/things that trigger or remind me of her (ie: having panic attacks, feeling like i'm back in the situation, increase anxiety, trust issues, whatever).\n\nSo I guess I answered my own question of whether or not she was abusive or not. But I guess the question in the title still could be applicable as I still dont know the difference.\n\nSorry this was mostly just a jumbled, rambling mess.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

At this point, there's too much to go over, and my posts from the past only scratch the tip of this abusive iceberg. But, I will say that my therapist (who I've only been seeing for about 3 months) told me during our last session that my relationship is the worst case of abusive control she's ever encountered.\n\nAnyway, in the past few weeks I have finally been taking a stand for myself. She keeps trying to get me to completely abandon my family, move out, quit my jobs, abandon my passions, and surrender to what she calls her \"total control.\" She says she wants full control over everything in my life (just not my thoughts, she said that would be crazy to police thoughts\u2014she just wants to police *all* of my actions). \n\nUnfortunately for her, I have been pushing back more than ever, refusing to quit things and drop everything for her when it jeopardizes my other projects.\n\nEach day now, we spend 5-6 hours (if not more) arguing back and forth on this issue. I think it's absolutely ridiculous that she would even ask for \"total control\" of my life, but she counters that it's necessary to protect herself from my \"bad decisions.\" I usually stick to my guns for a while until she eventually breaks down and starts crying (a rarity for her) ,and despite all that I know about how unhealthy things are, I feel my heart break when she cries and I am overcome by a sudden urge to make her feel better through any means possible\u2014including offering her that total control she craves. Of course, I quickly go back on this as the argument continues, leading to her feelings of betrayal.\n\nNow I'm in a bit of a big problem. For the past two days, I've been feeling like something's different\u2014like we're finally gonna break up for good and go NC. But tonight I suggested what I thought was a crazy proposition, and she actually agreed to it. This is gonna get a bit weird. Since we haven't had any form of physical intimacy beyond hugging and pecks on the cheek in the past 6 months (there was one instance a few months ago, but last night she revealed to me that it was just a \"pity f\\*ck\"), I told her I could give her total control if she agreed to reengage in physical intimacy with me (I thought it was crazy when I suggested it, because at this point I really feel the relationship is dead dead dead and after being rejected and scorned by her so many times I honestly don't feel the same way about her anymore (though I haven't made that clear yet\u2014I still care about her deeply)). She suddenly became overjoyed. She agreed that if I prove to her that I've surrendered total control to her over the next few months, she'll begin that physical relationship once again...in a few more months. I don't want things to last a few more months.\n\nSo basically I'm at this point where I feel bad telling her no, that she can't have this psychotic \"total control\" over what I read, where I go, how long I'm allowed to stay somewhere, what I'm allowed to do, who I'm allowed to talk to, and what my hobbies are\u2014among other things. I've been living this life for practically all of 2019 and it's so suffocating.\n\nI just know she's kinda happy and full of hope right now and I would absolutely hate to burst that bubble just after the decent conclusion to today...\n\nBut there's no way I can give her \"total control\" of my life right?\n\nHow am I supposed to defend my right (not hers) to have control over my life?\n\nAny advice from anyone would be so much appreciated right now. I really feel like I'm in such a bad place. Thank you all for taking the time to read.\n\nP.S + TW: Lately she's also been spitting, clawing, and scratching/punching me much more often than usual. I come home every night with fresh scratches on my arms and torso and saliva in my hair.

I have not specifically talked about this abuse to this extent online but I just had to because I badly need advice and I go crazy because I scratch my skin and scream hard alone in the room at 4 AM every time I remember those moments because no one around me believes that a mother can do something like that to her own daughter. These thoughts hit me hard when I am awake at night, I cry and cuss and I wish I could tear my skin apart and I curl into a ball trying to stop those memories flooding my mind. The abuse started exactly from year 2001 and continued on till 2010 and she continued showing few perverted signs on the year 2012 despite my accusation that I am aware of what she was doing and I want her to keep her filthy hands off me.\n\nShe lies and denies everything completely and downright makes own version of her stories. She is a huge manipulator and blames saying some friends put that idea on me and I was hallucinating. Mind you I have never tried drugs or smoked on my entire life. Her stories never match though but she comes up with wild ideas and fantasies extremely fast and a pathological liar. She is the kind of woman who genuinely believes God exist solely to protect her and will send some guardian angels on white horses to save her every time she gets caught in a situation where no one supports her ideas and opinions and acts extremely out of her age as she bursts out crying and tries to win by making people feel emotionally bad and guilty. My father and brother------I hate them both equally now because they side up with her and turned a blind eye towards the abuse when I begged my father saying she comes to my bed every time I am sleeping and touches me inappropriately with a very disgusting expression on her face and she says she has the right to touch me because she carried me for 9 months.\n\nNow I am 30 years old and I do dream of having kids but..... the memories of what she did to me still haunts me and I break down into tears when I am with my husband who loves me a lot. If I have children I do not want to leave them alone with her. I live in the USA now. I have given her several chances to confess and apologize for all the things she did to me but she completely denies what she did and I am just drained now and want no part of her in my life as she always bring chaos and drama that makes me suicidal and depressed. She openly insults me in front of the entire family and shows authority and power because she knows I cannot do anything back but tolerate her and even if I do or open my mouth to insult her back or call her out for her manipulative behaviors the entire family---- aunt, uncle, cousins, my dad will come to her defense and she smiles in a sinister way when that happens.\n\nI have cut communication with them but they always try to get back into my life and emotionally blackmails me constantly saying they will die and their diabetes and pressure increases because of my silence which hurts them sentimentally.  How dare I don't always agree with their opinions and how dare I am for having my own views!! How dare I do not dance like a dog for them and say yes when they want a yes and say no when they want no for an answer. How dare I am not their puppet and talk back when I am who I am and wore good clothes and have good education background because of their money!! She even told my husband if anything happens to my father it will be my fault for not \"keeping\" them happy always.\n\nI feel like I am being torn apart, at the end of the day she is still my mother and I am an emotional fool. I know I am angry and want to take legal actions against her if she continues to play mind games with me and disturbs my emotional well-being..... trust me.....I don't want to take it to the law wholeheartedly but arrrrrgh she makes it so difficult for me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She genuinely never told me sorry and told my uncles I am sick in the head. Not only that but after I left that wretched place called home and came to USA, I did not speak to her for almost a year, did not see her face to face for 2 years and she pleaded and cried and sent me texts to talk to her. I then broke my long silence which is why she visited me at November 2017 and just like that my premonition came true, nothing changed, she was still the same manipulative, drama queen and brought fresh new havoc between me and my husband. The tipping point for me was when she and I were on the kitchen and she casually told me how I have always blamed her of doing something so corrupted and unspeakable, its the biggest tragedy of her life and that she was not the one who touched me inappropriately but it was a Demon disguised as her who gets infatuated with human girls.......SERIOUSLY??!!! You see how stupid/dumb she thinks I am? and how she takes advantage of any kind of parental love/sympathy I have for her that is deeply buried in me? I have given her so many chances but some people will never change! Ruined my new year on 2018 too when I went to NY to visit them, she started her game of politics again where the entire family took her side and I left that snowy night crying all my way on the subway with people giving me odd looks.

So again being \"the friend\" I lent my suit cause I wasn't using them at that time.\n\nCome pageant day, he didn't wear the suits. Which made me wonder, who would borrow two suits and never use them at all? Oh yeah he didn't win the grand prize. At first he said he got 3rd place and then revised it into 2nd place. Gaslight much?\n\nI realize that he didn't want to use the suit on a pageant. But he did want to wear to impress on the toxic relationship that pissed me off because he would not stop talking about it.

No answer up until it was around 5pm. It was very unsettling. He said we should meet at the gym, which is where we always meet anyways.\n\nI got really pissed at this point. He walk toward me while working out and asked if I was pissed? I immediately hurl the accusation \"Did you use my suit outside the pageant?\". He didn't answer my question, but he did have this deer on the headlights look and a gulp of saliva in his throat. In my head I was like GOTCHA! He tend said that he needed a smoke.\n\nI could not believe this person was LYING straight up. So I went down and followed him. While smoking he said \"Yeah I think you need to vent out your issues with me.\".  And so I did, I asked him about the relationship about this are you together with this girl?\". He said \"NO!\". BUT! His body language was saying a different thing. He was giving me duper delight, basically smiling while denying the whole thing. I asked the question four times and him trying to control his smile on his face. Till he got tired and said \"Okey, lets put it this way. I am waiting for her to change her mind and choose me.\". He really sounded like Jay Gatsby waiting for Daisy Buchanan to change her mind I kid you not.\n\nAfter that I was still bothered to what really happened to my suit. He told me if he want to hop in the car so he can take me home. Still pissed at what happened. I still pressed the issue of the suit. I asked the question and then followed by a denial with duper's delight.I kept pressing and yes I was annoying. So out came THE TRUE SELF! He sped up the car started yelling \"WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?\". \"I CAN'T HAVE THE GIRL, BUT I CAN'T LIVE W/O HER, SHE MY BEST FRIEND(shokt cause we kept back stabbing her when we hang out.).\". He went GTA style swirving the car at high speeds. \"WHAT DO YOU WANT?\". \"YOU WANT ME TO TAKE OUT THE GUN SHOOT MY HEAD OFF?\". I freak out and told him stop. Then I used the grey rock method. He parked the car and punched the wall. I got some safely with him hyperventilating. I tried explaining he was still pissed got off took my two suits at his car.\n\nHarrowing experience I tell you! It was then I finally figured that he was a narcissist and I was a supply! I felt guilty knowing this was a behavioral disability. I minimized my interactions with him on facebook and when we meet at the gym still act cordially.

I asked him for an in person apology on Thursday and he refused because he was not in a good mind set and wanted to mean the apology and wanted to be in a good mood so he wasn\u2019t mean to me again. I basically did not hear this and took it as he did not want to own up to his mistakes and was not bothered by it. I have been particularly bad as far as the trauma and PTSD goes for about a month now because it\u2019s coming up on an anniversary of my past relationship ending. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gone even a week without a flashback or panic attack over this past trauma. So when I started to think these things I immediately began to believe he was being abusive and I panicked. I panicked like I haven\u2019t panicked in a while. I went to him since he wouldn\u2019t come to me. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have been doing it but just couldn\u2019t stop. I bombarded him with this fear of mine and he immediately broke up with me because he didn\u2019t want to abuse me. I reverted back to what I did with my ex and begged him to stay like a fool. He also said that he resented me for my trauma and that he didn\u2019t think I listened to him and I made his problems about me. I wouldn\u2019t leave at first because I knew he didn\u2019t mean it. We had been doing very well recently and I know he is in love with me. I eventually did leave and just absolutely fell apart. I was strong and took him his things the next day and did not beg for him back which made me feel very strong because it was something I had never done before. I have him letters I had wrote him as well. When I gave him these things I could see the pain in his eyes, I knew he was hurting and I knew he still loved me, but I left anyway. Later that night after I had fallen asleep he messaged me about something of his I forgot to give him and questions about the letter. We ended up meeting in person and talking for a bit. He pointed out that I was not listening to him which is true because I was panicking and also asked about how I made his issue about me and gave me an example from a few weeks ago. Thinking back he was right. I did and I have in the past but I have tried very hard not to and sometimes I do fail. So when I fully reflected on this situation with a friend of mine who works for a domestic violence agency we pretty much agreed it wasn\u2019t an abusive thing it was a matter of neither of us being in the right state of mind to be having this conversation. \n\nSo after reflecting on this with her I realized that the things I was feeling that made me panic were not his intentions but things that my ex used to do. No matter the problem I brought to him he made it my fault and he made it his problem and got upset with me. So I was translating my ex\u2019s intentions onto him and he did not have those intentions. He wanted me to hear him that he needed to be alone in order to be in the right mindset to converse with me about this. \n\nWhen thinking about why I make his problems mine I realized that it goes back to when my ex made everything my fault. My default is that he doesn\u2019t feel well about certain things and is upset about certain things because of something I have done or because I am not good enough for him. \n\nLooking back at that night when I was that emotional I should not have gone over there and things would\u2019ve been much different. I also wasn\u2019t present with the relationship I was back with my ex. \n\nI now feel much better that I have processed these things and realized what happened. \n\nI now know when I get like that I need to take a step back and calm down. Process things aloud maybe or meditate. Try different things to bring me down. \n\nI just wanted to kind of get that off my chest and process with people who would understand a little better. \n\nI plan on talking to him about this and things that I want him to explain to me as well.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Periodically, I came back for advice and support and found strength in getting advice and giving it.  Because you all helped me through a though time, I wanted to share an update.\n\nOne of the major things holding me back from leaving was the fact I had no financial independence, but over the last few months I have worked a few temp jobs and have finally been hired full time (baring any last minute budget changes).  This means I will soon have my own health/dental care and the means to support myself.  Assuming I do this right and pay off a few large debts quickly (amassed trying to get my teaching certificate only to learn it was a scam), I can be in my own place safe and sound by the spring.\n\nAs for the husband, he still has not said \u201cI am sorry for hurting you\u201d but has come to realize that he is.  He claims it is because of his poor health but refuses to see a doctor.  His outbursts are fewer in number but everyday he says or does something to demean or belittle me.  For example, we had a plumbing emergency recently and he told me to handle it.  I did and as I was telling him what the plumber did, he declared I had been scammed and was stupid for letting myself be scammed and waste money.  He began quoting laws and building codes for the 1970s as proof that I was wrong and had a friend who was a builder in the 1970s text me on how right he was.  I had the plumber email him the more current laws, which he ignored.  He has also been taking his friends out to dinner and to events but continues to tell me we have no money for date night and the grocery bill can not exceed $75 every two weeks while he eats out every work day.\n\nSo, not out yet but progress is being made.  My hope is he will see a doctor and get on some medicine to make him the man I married, at which point we can begin repairing our relationship.

He was in touch, we had sexted 5 days prior to him posting with his fiancee on social media. It was less sextimg, since I noticed he never asked me how I was anymore, he ignored when I said I was not dealing with the roller coaster I was on. That I didn't like this covert form of relationship (Cheating basically).\n\nMost people can call the relationship something...I don't even have that privilege. It makes me feel rather insignificant. \n\nN has pushed me to get a bf after He got engaged. He had not stopped me from seeing other people. But he also insisted on carrying on the sexual tones that existed. He was relentless about pursuing that. I was always confused. Was that manipulation? To treat the sex, sexting, the intimacy was nothing. Is that an fwb relationship with a N ? But keep pushing for sex and sharing feelings. I couldn't refuse to sextimg even without harsh retaliation. \n\nMy fear is what if my codependency and passive expectations pushed a friend into acting out?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It was a lie.\n\nYou realize there has been a kind of morphing going on with their personality. They treat you more like you are just interacting with them, you feel like an acquaintance or family friend, or even an enemy at times. \n\nWe tend to stay committed to this person, through good and not so good times, the bad UNTIL we finally realise they are not in a phase, they are not going through a hard time, they are not just insecure or being cautious. They are something/someone else.\n\nTheir attempts to keep us in their grasp, are not gestures they use to communicate love. Its purpose is to continue inflicting pain, punishment with some intermittent crumbs of caring to keep us trapped, while they continue to receive from us whatever benefits they require at the time.

I (24M) have been emotionally abusing my now ex girlfriend (24F) for the last 12 months of our 19 month relationship.  \n\nFirstly, I take full responsibility for what I\u2019ve done.  I\u2019ve always known that I\u2019ve been more snappy and cold than \u2018normal\u2019 people and occasionally had felt an element of shame after an argument, but it\u2019s as if I was blinded to the true extent of the damage I was causing until now, when it\u2019s too late.\n\nLast Sunday an argument I caused got out of hand (with the things which were verbally said) more so than ever before and my girlfriend went home (50 mile drive at 2am), and broke down to her parents at 3am.  We didn\u2019t leave with a \u201cwe\u2019re done\u201d.  \n\nThe following morning I woke with shame and embarrassment like I have never felt before(at least no where near this extent) and googled \u201cwhy do I emotionally hurt my girlfriend?\u201d and \u201cwhy am I so toxic to people I\u2019m closest to?\u201d.  Over the next few days I wrote a letter to my ex stating I take full responsibility for how I\u2019ve been, apologised and said she deserves so much more and that I was ending it as to not drag her through any more of my behaviour in case I didn\u2019t changed once I\u2019ve been through counselling (which I had booked by this point).   As obvious as it is to me now, I genuinely didn\u2019t see how bad I was, when the penny dropped I absolutely crumbled. \n\nAfter my letter she messaged me and \u201chad to see me\u201d and said that \u201cI owed this\u201d to her.  She came over for 4 hours yesterday (Saturday, one day after my letter) initially she hated me.  Shouted, cried, and went through every example she had noted down (without me realising) over the last 12 months, this absolutely killed me and she was 100% right in every situation she recalled.  She then went to hug me, I resisted, but she insisted.  She didn\u2019t want to leave and as I went to go to the bathroom she followed me in, hugged me again for about 10 minutes  - I was breaking down ugly crying the whole time and she was emotionless which I had never seen from her before.  She then started moving towards me to kiss me and I resisted saying \u201cthat\u2019s not right, we shouldn\u2019t\u201d She didn\u2019t let me leave and kissed me again.  I was/am so confused. \n\nThe same evening she called me; \u201cthis is all I\u2019ve ever wanted from you but it\u2019s too late because my parents are done with you\u201d.  Her parents are going through a really hard time with her one other sibling which I won\u2019t go into.  She said she still loves me, wants me to get better, and have kids with me.  I want the same, but I need counselling first before ever entertaining the idea of getting back together.  Her parents however are a big issue.  They\u2019ve watch their daughter be whittled down and picked her off the ground when my behaviour had literally made her collapse when she arrived home after the argument which was by this time a week ago. I drove to her house today to apologise to her parents.  Her parents have been very welcoming and generally good hardworking people.  Her father was upstairs initially and her mum with some encouraging gave me some stern words.  When I left her dad had come downstairs and sat in the lounge.  I know I the door, creeped my head around and said \u201cI\u2019m so sorry for how I\u2019ve treated your daughter\u201d.  He said \u201cthat\u2019s alright, but I\u2019m done with you.  That\u2019s my daughter and I\u2019m done, best of luck for the future but me and you are done.\u201d  I expected worse, he must\u2019ve wanted to crush me but said it like that which is testament to the man he is.  Immediately after this my ex messaged to say \u201cI\u2019m sorry for how he spoke to you\u201d - this baffles me.  I clearly have some sort of hold on her.\n\nI decided I needed to be cruel to be kind and has to stop all contact.  However my ex has called me over 10 times and is bombarding me with messages of frustration as I wasn\u2019t messaging back.  She eventually spoke to my mum who knows the full unfiltered true story from myself.  Who in turn contacted me to say my ex told her that she feels I am preventing her from taking control now, when I\u2019ve had control for the last year.  And demanded that the least I could do it give her that.  So now I\u2019m torn between giving my ex the attention she thinks she needs to get proper closure and doing what I still think is best for her and going silent, as hard as that\u2019ll be for her.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

They also found a meth pipe. My brother made 2 sexual advancements towards me when I was 14 and 18. Both of which I was able to stop before it went further than forced mouth kissing. Now I\u2019m wondering if there was other abuse that I\u2019ve covered up in my brain. I am also a victim of intimate partner rape and stranger rape. Last year I was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, and depression. I have an amazing therapist (thank god), and an extensive support network. My mother and sister both know about those instances because I told them when I was a very young adult. I\u2019m now in my early 30\u2019s. My mother responded very poorly (\u201cyou know he\u2019d never do that again, right?\u201d). My dad doesn\u2019t know.

I work in the arts, and I am having an extremely difficult time being anything for anybody.

I feel for my mother and my father, but I am having trouble even picking up the phone to call them because I have so much trauma of my own to deal with. I just need to get this out there. I will make an action plan with my therapist this week, but I can\u2019t cope with anything. It\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t know what to do.

A lot of the posts here I resonated with but I can also identify in myself. I had a really dramatic argument yesterday that led to my partner leaving. \n\nIt\u2019s been a day but I\u2019m going over everything in my head from the beginning of our relationship. \n\n- whenever he was giving attention to his female friends I would emotionally withdrawal. I would withhold affection. Why? Because in my head he was treating them with more respect so I\u2019m gonna feel bad for myself. But after awhile I started to identify this so whenever that happened I would take time within myself and be honest that I was feeling jealous and that is my own insecurity to deal with. \n\n- overall whenever I was unhappy with him I wouldn\u2019t try to start a conversation about it. I just bottled it up until I got annoyed, huffing and puffing everywhere\n\n-I didn\u2019t take much accountability on things I was going to do. For example, He asked me to have my phone ringer on and stop hiding my phone. Its preference of mine to have it off and I\u2019m not hiding things, I\u2019m just anxious that I shouldn\u2019t be on my phone around him because I want to give him the attention. Regardless, I should have honored those requests because it makes him feel comfortable and trustful of me. \n\n- I\u2019m dismissive of his feelings in arguments. I get defensive because he\u2019s telling me something about myself that I\u2019m not seeing. It takes some deep reflecting to understand that but it\u2019s usually to late. \n\nThere\u2019s probably something else but these are recurrent in our relationship. It\u2019s taken us many arguments for me to see this and many times I fell short. \n\nFor him, it feels like he criticizes me for anything. Like my cooking, he will hover and ask if I did this or that. He will inspect how I did something and do it all over. I packed the ice chest once on a trip and he got mad because I did it wrong. I find myself feeling like I don\u2019t know how to do anything right and often times I ask him for his opinion which I\u2019m really asking for his approval. \n\n- when he\u2019s angry he goes quiet. When I ask what\u2019s bothering him or if he\u2019s ok. He says he doesn\u2019t know or that I wouldn\u2019t understand. When I try to ask questions he asks me to stop. When I ask if there\u2019s anything I can do he says he shouldn\u2019t tell me what to do. If I leave him be, that means I don\u2019t care or I\u2019m not trying. So I\u2019m stuck there feeling anxious and panicked. \n\n- he takes his anger out on me but doesn\u2019t apologize for it later. \n\n- arguments/fights. Whenever I point something out like his behavior he won\u2019t listen. He\u2019ll walk out of it and say \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear this bullshit\u201d he thinks I\u2019m trying to slander him when really I\u2019m trying to tell him how he\u2019s making me feel. \n\n- my feelings don\u2019t ever feel addressed. When I\u2019m being vulnerable and honest about something that\u2019s bothering me (and it\u2019s not about him) it some how turns into how he\u2019s so stressed out and already dealing with a lot that suddenly I\u2019m trying to make him feel better. \n\n- after an argument, he can go days without any reconciliation. The longest I allowed was a week until I broke and said something. I\u2019m ALWAYS the one to apologize for our arguments even if it\u2019s not my fault. Even now, we have a daughter that he watches while I work and he\u2019s not saying anything. \n\n-arguments are the worst. He guilts me so much. My mind goes blank and I can\u2019t remember what he said 10 min ago. It\u2019s a endless stream of what I did wrong and how cold hearted I am. He tells me that the real me is whatever comes out during our arguments. \n\nI just feel confused. He tells me I\u2019m this and that I\u2019m doing this to him but in my heart that\u2019s not my intention. I have these same narcissistic qualities but I mean at least I now know it\u2019s there? Idk if he could ever say that about himself. \n\nHe\u2019s a good person inside, he cares far more about others and he cares about his kids. He\u2019s respected in our community and by friends. He has a good network of people who are doing good things in this world. It just doesn\u2019t add up.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She played the damsel in distress very well, and when she would trigger a red flag I kind of just thought it was something that she would grow out of, because after all... she had to endure so much with how horrible her ex was right? Yeah, she played her cards well.\n\n\\-All of the red flags were there the whole time, and I was able to piece together sections... but once I learned that she had a narcissism disorder, it just made the trees turn into the forest again. And that's a good thing. It calmed me and helped me realize exactly what was happening. We have a strange way of normalizing and rationalizing even the weirdest things, and it was really good to see just how \"off\" the experience of a relationship with a compulsive narc is.\n\n\\-What happened to each of us that was played by a narc was wrong. When you go into a relationship and you open yourself up... it should deepen things, and connect you more. What we experienced is like we fell, and had our pockets picked by the person we trusted the most. The person that should've helped us up, and been our teammate. Learning that the narcs were simply love-bombing then studying us as things to exploit.. makes a lot of sense, and makes the end of the relationship so much easier. I wonder how many people have been discarded that still don't know how the deal worked though?\n\n\\-After the breakup, there's a period of contact as things resolve, and I read that it's a great idea to journal in a divorce so I did. And after things ended with our contact, I looked back at the journal and could see the patterns so clearly. She seemed to push things to the edge constantly, like there had to be a certain amount of stress and drama at all times. And each of my entries was hopeful that we could negotiate or compromise on a bunch of things, but it turns out she never did for one of them.\n\n\\-Before I even knew what it was I \"grey stoned\" her. When I found her at another guy's house for a sleepover for the second weekend in a row, I moved out. I had to temporarily stay at a place until I was able to move into my old place again. This meant that I had to leave a lot of stuff at her house until I was able to move it out. So with every interaction after our breakup, I kind of let her roll over me, because I felt that if we had ugly interactions that she would destroy my stuff. It turns out she did wreck some of it, and \"can't find\" some of my other valuables, but it would've been much worse if we had big arguments. The grey stone method is really good though, and has made a positive difference in my life.\n\n\\-Each interaction with her is sprinkled with landmines, and it's a careful process not to have a fight, but worth it.\n\n\\-After finding her cheating and then the breakup, I asked her who she thought it was the hardest on: her child, her, or myself. Without even a second thought my nex thought that the breakup was hardest by far on herself (even though she later said it was emotionless for her). I was expecting her to understand and say it was the hardest to her child (since her child was then losing a caring parent that it had bonded with). But of course it was the toughest to the woman that was having me look after all of her dogs and her child while she went out every weekend to stay over at her new supply's house.\n\n\\-I probably wouldn't have even tried finding out if she was cheating so much if she just took a cab back the night of, or even rushed home in the morning, but instead she would stay at his house until 1pm the next day. Talk about pressing her luck.\n\n\\-After she was exhibiting every single sign that \"your spouse might be cheating on you\", she was quite upset that I found out about it on only the second week in. I'm absolutely certain that it would've continued for a while, and that she wanted to kind of compare us to each other to before she made a decision. I forced her decision, and made her have to take the next supply without a planned switch. I'm also certain that she would have just pushed me to the point that I had to leave eventually, then she could be a victim and act like her new supply was just a really good friend.\n\n\\-She actually still tried to do that! She said what she did wasn't wrong, but I made her do it. And that my reaction to what she did was also wrong. It was quite amazing to hear this. So happy I escaped the spin zone.\n\n\\-After breaking my bookshelf, and leaving all of my stuff in the garage pissed on by dogs, and having so much of my stuff \"disappear\", she asked me if I could do her a favour the next time I picked up the child. I said that there was no way that I was doing her any favours, and she seemed so surprised by that. Then when I refused to do her another favour, she just said \"fuck you, you're never seeing \\_\\_\\_\\_child's name\\_\\_\\_\\_ again!\" and hung up. Then told the child that they were much better off without me.\n\n\\-I realize that fighting back to get back in the child's life, to just have it pulled every single time I don't follow my nex's orders would be the worst thing for the child. That part is really tough.\n\n\\-This was what my friends had warned me of, that she would use my relationship with her child to manipulate me more. It turns out that's exactly what she was doing, and instead of us being able to figure out how we could work together for the benefit of the child, she just went straight to using the child as leverage.\n\n\\-When I was moving out, and she was just watching me blankly, I told her that she would be more upset if I broke one of her fruit decorations, than me actually moving out. She said \"well yes, because I got those in Israel and they can't be replaced!\"\n\n\\-Narcs treat people like things, and things like people.\n\n\\-She never saw any of her actions as being bad in anyway, rather she just saw herself as being above accountability like the way that we peasants are. She also saw her bad behaviour as being caused by what others did to her. I've come to peace with how she is. Getting mad at her for not having the ability to have empathy is like getting mad at a kid that's deaf because they can't hear. It's just how she's wired and I wish her good luck to maybe one day finally find peace.\n\n\\-It's really weird to think of a narc. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt a lot, and look at things as a growth process. Narcs exploit that, and in times when a person would look in a mirror and think maybe I shouldn't be doing this to this person... a narc doesn't seem to have that.\n\n\\-I tried looking for youtube videos or blogs of people saying \"I'm a narc\". It's so interesting that the no ownership or accountability thing is so legitimate.\n\n\\-At this point she's delaying signing the divorce papers, and she definitely has more assets than I do, so who knows what she's up to... maybe I'll be back on here asking for help!\n\n\\-Good-luck to all of you finding your way out of this thing.

While the transgender part has nothing to do with the abuse (thank goodness) I feel it is necessary to put out there as this complicates my situational outcome.\n\nOver the past 12 years I have dealt with my husband being emotionally abusive to me and now our children. I stupidly thought in the earlier years he would learn to mature, grow and learn better coping mechanisms in our relationship, just like I did. That obviously wasn't the case.\nThe abuse ranges from entrapment, financial withholding, daily guilt tripping, negative projection based issues and feelings, name calling, manipulation, gas lighting and the list goes on. \n\nI have tried unsuccessfully to leave him multiple times over the years and each time he's used the fact he makes more income and our children as ways to blackmail me to come back. He's not only a narcissist who uses projection coping on everyone in the household, but he's smart about what he does when he feels threatened. \nTo make things worse, I have no family who can take me or our children in, but no friends as well as he's effectively cut me off from making meaningful relationships with people.\n\nIt's now begun to effect my children to the point that my daughter has had suicidal thoughts, my son immediately reacts to anything negative with negativity and I'm so stressed trying to keep the peace in my house, I picked up smoking marijuana at night to just sleep through the night and eat. (Which I've since been clean of as of last Thursday).\n\nLast Wednesday, my daughter finally spoke about all the things he says to her to her therapist. I then met with the therapist which promptly informed me this constitutes as child abuse. Which I'm in full agreement with. \n\nNow, I've tried so many times to get him to come to therapy or go see someone that whenever I bring it up to him I just get into an argument and I end up being the crazy one. I'm never right. Never. For a man with so many insecurities and faults, in his eyes if he ever admitted it, his world would come tumbling down. \nI've exhausted all of my resources trying to leave this man and have been so unsuccessful that I'd just given up. Trying to teach my children to cope with the abuse because the last time I told a therapist about what was going on, nothing was ever mentioned about child services or child abuse. I'd legitimately thought I just have to wait until he dies from a heart attack (he's very obese).\n\nSo, with my daughter's confession and the therapist looking into getting child services involved I'm both relieved and terrified. I've somehow convinced him to come in to talk to her therapist to give, \"his perspective on his daughter\". Which, in all honesty is not false but when he finds out that cps will be notified he's going to blow and in a big way. I'm deathly afraid right now that, hell lie to her like he always does, make it seem like we're the crazy people and then that night rip us to shreds emotionally. (He's never been physically abusive).\n\nI'm so stressed out about this that I haven't ate anything tangible in days. I'm exhausted and weak. I can't sleep well and every time I try to even think about food my stomach turns. I'm getting constant headaches and stomach aches. Not only from the thought of him going off on all of us, but the fact I may have to find a shelter to go to. \nHe shows no mercy when he's angry. He knows he'll get his way because I have no one that'll stand up with me against him and tell him he's wrong. My family won't help, my children are terrified of him and he holds all of our money. I already don't make much currently at my job and I don't have the money to just get a place for my children and I.\n\nEven now, it's hard for me to identify myself as the victim because he's told me for so very long, that I'm not. I'm just wrong and the one with the issues. I know it's not true but after a decade of someone you've loved telling you these things, it's hard to finally say something.\nI know I need to be strong for my children. I try every single day. Every waking moment is spent being the peace keeper between them. I walk on eggshells every day of my life. \n\nI don't know what to do. I've spun myself in circles trying every avenue I had to just leave and still see my children but nothing ever works. Every time I come back so I can just see my kids again. I pretend every single day of my life right now.\n\nI've never really dealt with child services and this before. I don't know what's going to happen. I feel like the system is going to swing in his favor as it always does. I'm lost and I need some guidance.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I have a naturally bad memory so I apologise that so much of this is foggy for me to describe.  I'm about to turn 21, have a Hufflepuff personality I've been told, I have aspects of Aspergers, and i may have anxiety, but I'm scared of the doctors so i havent been diagnosed, I also have a fiery temper if it's something I'm passionate over. I started puberty when I hit 9 years of age, my body started developing quite quickly, by 12 years old I was past training bras. My parents are awesome, they are of faith and us kids panned out atheist but none of us give a shit what the other is so long as we dont get on each others nerves about it. They are very loving, caring people. We alao have 2 houses  one in town and one out of town. We lived in town, moved out but kept the other house. From 12, we lived out of town. My brother is 4 years older than me, he has Aspergers and is on the high functioning side of the spectrum, extremely intelligent but bugger all social skills. He has always known right from wrong. I used to love him as siblings do, he was actually pretty cool for an older brother, always took care of me and protected me. When I was almost 10 he sexually assaulted me. I think it went over the Christmas holidays (6 weeks, this is Australia) roughly. I remember he touched me, got me to remove my clothes, lay in certain positions with him I distinctly remember for the most part he would only want my top half naked but I do remember after a bit of this that he got me to strip fully naked and he just looked at me. He never touched my vagina or arse, just my breasts. Anyway, I was too young to realise that this was wrong, I was a very naive and innocent girl. I remember getting all these strange feelings, that once I look back on them, was the desire to kiss and to be intimate. But I didn't realise at the time. Since I didn't think anything of what he was doing, I would often encourage him or ask if he wanted to see my breasts whenever my parents weren't home or were super busy. At some point this stopped, but I remember doing sexual things and having sexual thoughts in the following years, I would look at teachers and other kids and wonder what they looked like with no clothes on, I played with my breasts more and would enact scenarios with my Barbie dolls that were disturbing (I'm talking sexual assault, rape, sex, stripping, anything like that). The memory of what happened hid itself away and it didn't resurface until I was 13. Now we did about 3 hours a year of sex ed courses in primary school, so 11 and 12 years old. And in high school we study it for a full term in whichever classes cover it (HPE and Science I think). I don't actually know what triggered the memory to come back but I do remember I acted out by not going to school, I would kick, scream, yell, shout, anything to stop my parents from making me go to school for about 2 weeks. I don't know why I did that, I can't remember what happened but I remember being very upset, angry and moody all the time, even when I went back to school. Around this time started sibling rivalry in earnest and I couldn't stand him. I wanted to run away, anything to get his smug self away from me. But I couldn't. So I sucked it up. The memories went to the back of my mind and would occasionally pop up and make me upset but I dealt with it privately from then onwards. I slowly started talking to my friends about it when I was 15 and got their opinions. No one knew what to think. I have one friend I've known since I was 7 who's been through far worse than I, and we bonded even more over this, she is the one person I have been able to talk to who understands me and I am so grateful for her in my life. So I've been a pretty sexual person and by 13 I wanted to have sex but abstained til my 17th birthday. I realised I have  high sex drive as well. At 17 \u00bd I moved out with a boyfriend and his parents because Mum and I were fighting (I didn't realise I was a bratty teen and she didn't realise that I didn't know, and that she looked like a bitch for no reason). He broke up with me, I grudgingly moved back in, to the town house, because it was close to work and I could be more independent with family at the other house. Mum and I have patched it over now and we're very close thankfully. I have just moved out of home, near my parents and I see them every Sunday. My brother has never had a job, didn't graduate school, does nothing productive with his life and is still living at home. I have just come off working 3 jobs, totalling 50+hrs a week and getting half the amount of sleep just so I could save money. Mental health breakdowns made me realise I needed to take care of myself, I kept one job, got out of a 2 year long toxic, verbally abusive, manipulative relationship and it has been so long since I've felt this happy. So I'm at a tricky point. I can't tell my parents what happened because it will destroy them, I can't bear the though of doing that to them, but they keep asking me why I don't talk to him, won't let him near me etc. They keep reminding me how good a brother he is and that he's my brother, why don't I show him love? My 21st party is coming up and I've made it explicitly clear he is not invited, they tried a couple times to include him but I shut them down (and felt absolutely horrible, they looked so sad and upset). They have invited him to every other birthday party I've had even when I've said I don't want him there. This time they can't override me cause it's my house. I don't know what to do though. I want to disown him and never have to speak of or to him again but there's no way I can justify it to them or make them understand, but I don't want to make them upset, I feel like I'm letting them down. And I refuse to let him win by pretending there's nothing wrong. It's been an issue for a few years but it feels more pressing the older I get. I want my parents to be happy. They deserve to be happy. Mum has also recently been finding herself and getting into astrology (please don't judge, let her be her). She did our birth charts and current charts up when she started and her teacher read them to her (It's very complex so it's gonna take her a while before she can read them that well herself, she is going quite well though). The teacher pointed out in my chart that I need to let go of whatever I'm holding onto towards a direct male family member. This woman has never met me btw. Mum came home and talked about it and asked what beef I had with Dad, I explained absolutely nothing, she was sure it was the stirring up they did when I was a kid, they did it to toughen me up because I'm highly sensitive. I don't hold anything for that, I know it was just fun. I gave it back to them as much as I received it. Then she realised it must be something towards my brother. I shut up about then and wouldn't talk to her about it, so she knows there's something or several somethings have happened that I can't let go of yet. She wants to know what, but I know she won't want to know. She's an over thinker and highly sensitive like me. I'm not doing that to her or Dad, not making them feel like they failed as parents. But I'm torturing myself in the process. What do I do? I'm sorry this is so long too.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

My husband is more of the manipulative type than the physically violent type, and in Tennessee, that makes a huge difference.

She was very kind to me in the relationship at first, she constantly complimented me and looked up to me as her idol. I think she was obsessed with me, because she would text me at least every hour, never stray from my side at school, and acted angry when I hung out with other friends. \nBut I feel like she constantly complimented me to try and get my trust so that she could then use my insecurities against me later, because I told her I was insecure about my intelligence, and then fast forward a couple months later, whenever I forgot anything or couldn\u2019t focus because of mental issues, she\u2019d call me stupid, idiot,  moron, etc. I\u2019m also a transgender male and I told her that, and she respected my pronouns at first and then she started calling me \u201cwoman\u201d and triggering my dysphoria, even when I voiced I was uncomfortable with this. She told me she\u2019d kill herself if we ever broke up, because I was the only person she ever needed and we were meant for each other. One day my voice changed tone (I didn\u2019t even realize it at the time) and she withdrew from me the whole day and then texted me later on that night on how much that hurt her. This is just one example, I was constantly walking on eggshells in the relationship. \n\nSome days I\u2019m not able to go to school because I\u2019m not in a well enough mental state, and when I can\u2019t make it she\u2019ll always explain to me, in great detail, all of the amazing things she did that day with her other friends and how awesome the day was without me there. \n\nShe told me she was abused on around the first week of us being friends, but when we broke up I saw her constantly hanging out with her abuser and being friends, laughing, being happy with her so that was a little off putting to me. (I don\u2019t doubt that she was abused, but I don\u2019t see many people who are abused and got out of the relationship actively trying to get back in the relationship and being happy and having fun with their abuser, so that was just kind of strange I guess) \n\nShe also talked about keeping me in her basement and locking me up there so that no one else would have me but her. \n\nAnother thing she did was constantly talk about her problems and how sad her life was (i mean like once every 2 days she\u2019d vent to me for about two or three hours) and if I wasn\u2019t listening the whole time and always offering advice and help she\u2019d get upset. I have my own life, and I can\u2019t be waiting hand and foot on you all the time.\n\nEventually, I realized this was unhealthy and began trying to distance myself and ignoring her. (Probably not the best move on my part and I realize this now, but I was worried she\u2019d do something if I bluntly told her I didn\u2019t want to be in the relationship anymore) This led to a messy breakup, but I still fear her to this day and I feel like I\u2019m haunted by the things she\u2019s said and done to me.\n\nBasically, she made me feel shitty a lot and like I was stupid or not enough.\n\nThis got way longer than I thought it would be, and it\u2019s probably messy and not very coherent, but it\u2019s 1 am and this is really eating me up inside.

I just wish I could forget about a lot of things that happened to me because the memories hurt.\n\n\n    I was 12 years old when he first invited me outside with him alone. He was my step brother, only about 2 years older than me. I trusted him, and so i agreed. We lived in a house by the woods, and in those woods was an old little abandoned hunting shack. It was very small, made of wood, and when you stretched out your arms, you could touch a wall on either side. There was no floor, and all that was on the small dirt patch was an old short stool. The door to the shack had a wooden pull down lever that locked from the outside. \n\n    \n    He lead me out into the woods to the shack. We lived right next door to his cousin, so he ended up meeting us at the shack there as well. We entered the shack, and my step brother suggested a game of truth or dare. I thought nothing of it, and being a bored little 12 year old, i agreed to play. His cousin agreed as well. Little did i know, this wasn't just an innocent game. It started out relatively normal, like \"Lick the wall\", and things like that. But then my step brother said to just cut out the truth, and we only did dares.\n\n    \n    My step brother turned to me. \"Your turn.\" he said. I nodded and he continued. \"I dare you to take off your shirt.\" Ill never forget that first dare. It may not seem as bad, but it was the start of what would continue for the next 2 years of my life. I told him no. He said that if i refused, he would tell our parents that everything was my idea, that i did it willingly, and that i made him. He said he would blame it on me, and that if i still refused, he would threaten to hurt me. 12 year old me was naive, and didn't realize that if i went to our parents first, i might have been able to get out of this situation. But unfortunately, i didn't know. So out of fear, i complied with his demands.\n\n    \n    For the next few months, every time i went to my dads house, he would make me go to that shack with him and his cousin alone. steadily, the dares grew more and more extreme. By the end of it, i was getting dares to lick/ suck there dicks, and to let them touch my chest and put there finger near/in my vagina. I tried to resist and say no, but every time i thought about refusing, the threats would come, so i continued. I was scared of what would happen if i stood up for myself.\n\n    \nOnce i went over to his cousins house. I was upstairs with his female cousin when she had to go downstairs and use the bathroom and such. I was about to go downstairs as well when her brother, the male cousin, showed up at her doorway. There rooms were right next to each other. He said he wanted to show me something on his xbox, and to come to his room to see. Gosh i was an idiot, but i got up and followed him to his room. I walked in and he shut the door. I looked at him weird but simply asked what he wanted to show me. He told me nothing. I was confused. He told me to drop my pants. I tried to get around him but he blocked the doorway. He was larger than i was, so it was hopless over powering him. He told me if i didnt, he would force me too... so i did. What can i say, i was stupid and afraid. I was his and my step brothers puppet. I couldnt escape. So i dropped my pants. Then he walked over and grabbed my wrist, and pushed me against the wall and force his finger into my vagina. He wouldnt let me go for about 2 minutes untill he heard voices at the bottom of the stairs. I pulled up my pants and he shoved me out of his room. The female cousin came back, and i never told anyone what happened.\n\n\n    Then my dad and his mom moved to another house, but this didn't stop him. At the new house, there was an old barn that was just beginning to collapse, but was still standing. He would take me out there to the field and inside this barn, and continue to force me into situations, and threaten me if i didn't do want he told me to do. He would sit on a wooden bench with a timer on his phone, and said that i had to give him a blow job and wasn't aloud to stop until the timer went off. He would set the timer for about 2 minutes at a time. At this point, i was still afraid. And do i did. Its something i regret to this day, but what choice did i have? It was all i could do to keep him from going through with what he threatened. \n\n    \n    There were other things he did as well. In the bard there was a large room filled with logs and tree stumps that had been cut and stored in there for who knows how long. In that room, he would grab me from behind and touch my chest, force his hands down my pants, all the while whispering things in my ear such as, \"you like that dont you, you slut\" and \"this isn't so bad, is it? i bet you like it.\" He would always remind me of what he would do if i refused to do what he said. He even once made me pee in the corner of the barn so that he could watch. When i was done, he went over and peed over top where i had. He would jack off onto my shoes, and then make me wipe it off myself.\n\n    \n    There were things that happened in the house as well, not just in the barn. There was a time one summer where our parents would go to work and we would be left home alone with my older sister. She would usually be upstairs in her room so it was basically just us. Whenever i was walking around the house he would randomly come up and grab my waist from behind and hump me with his clothes on. I would try to tug away, but he was strong, and wouldn't let me go until he chose to. He had a bedroom right next to the bathroom, and in the shower/ tub area, there was a hole next to a faucet that connect right to his closet. Whenever i would take showers, he would watch me through that hole, and once he even put his dick into the hole and whispered, \"touch it\" to me. There was also a window in my room that connected to the back porch outside, and he would watch me change through that window. Once i even woke up in the middle of the night to see him standing at my doorway jacking off to me sleeping. I pretending to be asleep until he walked away, and then cried.\n\n    \n    This all happened repeatedly for 2 years, spanning from when i was 11, almost 12, to when i was about 13 and a half. \n\n    \n    Then one day i get a message on google hangouts.\n\n    \n    It was from my step brother. He told me to keep the app on his phone, so that we could talk even when i was at my moms house. He would send me very inappropriate pictures of himself, and demand i send them back, using his usual threats if i refused. I sent him one picture. One. That was possibly the biggest mistake i could have made. See, if i didn't send that picture, he wouldn't have a very strong leverage. But since i sent that one picture, a new threat developed. Now if i didn't continue to send pictures, and if i ever uninstalled the app or blocked him, he told me that he would show our parents the picture and tell them that it was all my fault. That i sent it to him willingly.\n\n    \n    Then, then my mom went through my phone one night. She saw the pictures. She saw everything. Unfortunately the parts where he threatened me, the only thing that would prove that i never wanted to do this, wasn't on that screen. Those were exchanged in person. He was smart like that, and it was his word against mine.\n\n    \n    The next day, my mom contacted the police. She was at my aunts house, which was maybe a 2 minute walk away, when they arrived. She called me to tell me to come over without telling me why. When i walked through the door into the entryway, There was a Man standing in the kitchen talking to my mom and my aunt. He greeted me with a kind hello and introduced himself. He explain why he was there and began to ask me some questions. I refused to answer the questions, and even avoided eye contact. I completely shut down. I was terrified. Eventually he thanked my mom for contacting him, said that an investigation would start(since at the time no one knew it was actually my step brother), took my phone, and left. We sat in silence for a solid minute before my mom spoke. i dont remember exactly what she said, but it was along the lines of, \"Why would you do this\". I simply stood up, and left. I walked back home.\n\n    \n    for about the next 3 weeks, my mom was on the phone with the police as they were working to find out who it was. Eventually they tracked it down to a 14 year old boy in my dads town. When i heard this, i cried for hours. I was terrified that my step brother would find out about everything that was happening. The police told my mom that since he was a minor as well, all they could do was contact his mom to talk to him. \n\n    \n    The next time i went to my dads house, my dad took me outside and talked to me about it. He told me that he was disappointed in me, and told me that he better not find out about this happening ever again. Essentially i was blamed for it. I was punished, i wasn't aloud to have electronics for nearly 2 years, while he got off scott free with nothing but a scolding from his mom. \n\n    \n    As im writing this, im 15, turning 16 in January. It is 3:25 am, and i decided to write this down. I am still very much affected by it, and the memories, and what happened, the fact that no one knows the truth of what happened and that everyone still believes it was my fault... well all i can really say is that it hurts.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

{"post_id": "dhom0m", "created_utc": 1571048440, "title": "Do you know the phenom of so-called \"Limerence\" or \"Infatuated Love\" - Advice in attraction to narcissists", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "I don't know if you know about limerence, but it's a term not too many know about. So limerence is a fantasy based love, where you're usually left with nothing in the long run. In limerence, you create an image of a person, say a \"narcissist\" and the false-self has been described as being \"void\" or very limited. In limerents (admirers of an LO = limerent object) attracted to narcissists, you have to create an image of a narcissist, you so admire. What I found out by the end - there's nothing there. Confusing? If an empath is a \"white hole\", nigh endlessly capable of giving validation, theoretically a narcissist is seeking to take whatever you have. I call this emotional vampirism. Limerence is also worse than your average crush and the biggest risk is to get romantically involved with a person only in it for themselves. Sometimes, as was in my case, limerence was based on narcissistic abuse (covert/some BPD with highly narcissistic elements) This messed up my psyche badly, and the reason you may be literally physically addicted to someone who's narcissist, is due to these factors.\n\n1 Intermittent reinforcement. This is a very powerful tool to \"occasionally give candy\" so to speak. To make you forget about all the bad things that happened. This is a \"rat in a cage with a lever giving food\" science experiment basically. So if you're with a narcissist, at first they commit to you 100% Then intermittently, and you're hooked by the initial responses, but now \"pulling the lever that gives you candy\" isn't doing anything. Well, that's weird. Huh... Then suddenly ta-da! Some food or candy or whatever appears and in an emotionally starved state, the victim is more pleased. It has an enslaving effect and you don't even know it early on.\n\n2. Hoovering. As you may or may not not, narcissists hoover/vacuum you in. Very much based on what I talked about formerly. In my case, hoovering was done intermittently, to seek validation. Keep in mind, hoovering in the case of a narcissist, is meant for you to validate them in some way, not you. Someone gives you silent treatment for days, weeks or more, and suddenly expects a world of validation? Oh, get out of here :'D\n\n3. Love bombing. Take exaggerated compliments from other people in a critical way. I don't feel the need for validation that much, but god damn it some kind of attention from the right kind of sources would be nice. But yeah, love bombing is pretty obvious to me in most cases. As you grow, things turn out to be too good to be true. My advice is healthy skepticism and believing that humans are inherently full of the stinky brown stuff itself. They're not Gods, okay?\n\n4. Gaslighting. Moving objects/items you to \"disappear and reappear\" and saying \"oh it was there, I saw it all the time\" is one big and classic sign. So around a narcissist or just a stranger, make sure to keep your most treasured possessions in your pockets. Wallet or phone and memorize where you placed your items. This kind of action is followed by denial of any involvement in such action. Another kind is indeed just trivializing any bigger event, like serious arguing, so the victim of such abuse, will forget what happened and stays silent, until another major event occurs, or it's the \"crazy victim's fault\". If a person is nice to you 5-10% of the time, and say is abusive or gone from your life for the rest of time, they're not worth of your time. It's 50/50 for me, or very close, and I cut off contact. No necessarily meaning going \"no-contact\", just limiting my input in the relationship.\n\nAs they say that no-one will love you, until you love yourself. Not completely true imo. I'm capable of empathizing with people extremely low on self-interest, if they're just decent people. In a sort of perverted way, you \"love\" a narcissist, but once you find out that the reason why they do it, going no contact is the best way to recover. And it's the worst offense you can commit to a narcissist, if they find you valuable, but still are unable to take your emotional stress into consideration. Staying with a real narcissist is often a bad option, unless there are very, very strict boundaries. Keep in mind, there are narcissistic individuals, who may be of great benefit and there are the more disturbing cases of actual narcissistic disorders, that usually don't work in your favor. So being limerent over a narcissist = I have some bad news to you. Wake up, work on it and take a moment to collect everything that has happened between you and your supposed \"narcissist\". I don't know your story. This is just my advice, if you're limerent over someone, who isn't interested in you OR worse, abuses you, and forever denies it.\n\nTake care.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

it was only about that night and all that tells me is he doesn\u2019t want that experience to be out there. my mum had came upstairs while i was in a serious bout of constant depression due to being trapped in this house and she told me i had to talk to him because she was worried he would actually kill himself. i said no, i didn\u2019t want to risk my mental health just so he could get some closure about only one thing he worried about out of multiple things he did to me, i just wanted to make him live with it because again i\u2019d been made to live with the constant pain for the entirety of my childhood and now adulthood. i did not owe him anything. even then he continued to use controlling and manipulative tactics towards me when he saw i was talking about my experience to someone i trust. i am just tired of having to think about everything he put me through, and thinking about why he did it.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

For any and all of you out there who have been in any kind of a narcissistic, toxic relationship, I'm sure most have \"agreed\" to things that you did not want to do, but to hold the relationship together, you agreed to pacify the narcissistic partner. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNothing I experienced was on the level of \"Handmaid's Tale\" abuse, but I think that's the problem with sexual abuse as a conversation topic. Like domestic violence in general, it's assumed to be punches thrown and outright rape.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNone of that happened to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I experienced was pressure -- a whole lot of pressure to engage in sexual acts with people I did not want to be involved with, but I always agreed to please my ex.

Sorry for the long post. \n\nThe older I (28F) get the less sure I feel about my childhood. As a kid I acted \u2018hard done by\u2019 when perhaps things weren\u2019t so bad. I was also pretty stubborn and entitled at times and bullied my younger brothers which I\u2019m not proud of. I think in many ways I was privileged compared to other people. \n\nStill, there were some incidents that I think would count as abusive but I\u2019m also not sure if I could/ should consider myself abused?\n\n- I was helping my dad lift a climbing frame and accidentally lifted it in a way that I think hurt him so he reactively responded by smashing it into my face.\n- I was obsessive about showering and it always made us late on the weekends. My dad would yell at my mum to \u2018drag her out by the hair if you have to\u2019 and they would turn the hot water off and I would be screaming in a rage.\n- I would get into heated arguments with my dad and a few times he responded by wrestling me to the ground and pinning me down with his fist in my hair.\n- I once interrupted my dad shouting at my mum (not out of genuine concern for my mum but because I think I was wanting to emulate something I\u2019d seen in media/ get attention/ some other disingenuous reason I\u2019m unsure about)... he responded by chasing me from the room in a rage, catching me and smashing my face twice against the stairs with his fist in my hair.\n- I once asked for more custard and was given the whole pot. I couldn\u2019t finish it and so my dad grabbed me by the hair and smashed my face into it. I was covered in custard and red wine that spilled and my mum had to take me to the bathroom to clean up.\n- My dad pressured me to move to America with the family (I was 16 and could legally move out) by flying me out there to (not a negative thing itself) and when I was still not convinced threatening to put me on a plane to *main airport in my home country* and cut me off (maybe this isn\u2019t so awful because I was being a difficult teenager?)\n- When I moved over there I didn\u2019t want to get involved or help out once we got to the new house so my dad dragged me down the stairs and yelled at me to accompany my mum to the laundrette.\n- My dad would occasionally threaten to \u2018put me on a plane to an airport of his choosing\u2019 if I went ahead with whatever behaviour (usually going out with friends) that he didn\u2019t want me to do. I think he also threatened my poor behaviour with similar things (send me away to x place) when I was younger too. \n- In general there was probably quite a bit of yelling and arguing that went on between my dad and I\n\n\nMum shamed me for my weight and behaviour and we argued a lot. She\u2019d occasionally chase me upstairs and I would block myself in my room until she calmed down. She also trashed my room a couple times as I\u2019d refuse to clean it. However I only see her behaviour as being reactive and her shaming was intended to make me change. I don\u2019t see her as being abusive but my dad I\u2019m less sure about?? ... \n\nI guess the thing that makes me extra uncertain is I don\u2019t think I ever felt unsafe or that I was walking on eggshells or anything like that. I guess everything that went on felt normal? In general I think I kept to myself and just didn\u2019t have much desire to be involved in family life. I could be awful to my brothers as I mentioned and exhibited other challenging behaviours such as stealing food and money (again, not proud). I also had other obsessive tendencies beyond the showering and my general attitude could be pretty bad.

We get on okay but aren\u2019t close seeing as I went with my mum when my parents divorced. If I talked to them now it would likely cause a problem as my dad is very involved in their lives and though he and I get on okay now there are certain topics (such as my mum) that are off limits...\n\ntl;dr: Not sure if I experienced actual abuse or just poor parenting?", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He didn't talk to me for five days saying that our son won't end up as a \"fag\" because I'm too soft.\n\nYesterday after returning from a few days with my friends (I feel like this was the root of the problem) he screamed at me claiming I scratched his car. I said I did not scratch his car. He called me a liar about 50 times.

He said a lot of extremely hurtful things, psychologically terrorized me, tried to isolate me from my immediate family, threatened to kill himself in front of me. \n\nReliving all my benign memories of him/us is painful with the new understanding of who he is - a narcissist, psychopath, anti social. There are few purely joyful memories now. \n\nReading books and blogs he checks almost all the boxes. He is evil and his goal was to get me to question my sanity and convince myself I was insane... he nearly got me there. Luckily people in my life rescued me on June 26th and took me from our home to a safe place. Luckily I had the strength to go NC and the research skills to learn a lot about narc abuse in a 48 hour period.

Being 15 I thought this was a romantic gesture, and proceeded to become more and more isolated. I lost my friends, people who had been there for me for years suddenly wouldn\u2019t talk to me. Any friends I did have were evil and awful according to him. \n- I was under constant comparison to other girls who were skinnier, prettier or fitter. Nothing I did was right. Every hair cut was wrong, I never wore enough make up. \n- He repeatedly reported that I was never the \u201cperfect\u201d girl he needed and I would never be enough. \n- Sex wasn\u2019t optional. It was everyday if I wanted it or not. If I said no it was because I was a prude with no sex drive and other girls would sleep with him every night if he wanted. And when I did it wrong I would be forced to the floor. \n- He brought an engagement ring for me and then proceeded to hold it over my head. If I did something wrong he would say \u201cwell I guess I\u2019m not proposing then\u201d, when I had done nothing wrong the reason would be that I could never be perfect enough for him. \n- He would talk down about me to his friends to the point that one of them commented on how awfully he talked about me. He laughed when someone who never met me tried to defend me. \n- He knew how exactly to torture me. He knew exactly what I feared most. The worst threat was that he would run over my cat. He made this threat everyday and when I broke up with him I hid my precious fur baby inside for days to be safe. \n\nFinally, towards the end things got as worse as my friends and family could bear. This one night we had gone out with my friends and his friends. I had been awake since 6am and had another 6am the next day, so at 2am I wanted to go home (naturally). He wouldn\u2019t have this. I said he could stay out without me! Instead he dragged me down the street until my friend rushed up to him and stopped him. She said it was the worst night of her life seeing me treated this way. \n\nA few days later I told my mum and dad what was happening. My dad marched up to my room, helped me throw everything in boxes and we left the boxes outside the house. When I told him we were done he was catatonic. He got his mum to come and beg for my forgiveness. He threw the ring at me, begging me to marry him. So I did the most amazing thing I\u2019ve ever done, and I walked away. \n\nI can\u2019t end this post without accrediting the magical people who helped me through it and kept me safe.

It used to be just me, my grandmother, and my grandfather, but he died a couple years back. My mom lives in town, and I see her probably once or twice a week. Recently, I've gotten a stepmom, but I don't talk to her really.\n\nMy grandmother is a narcissist, but my friends are starting to say she's abusive. She's previously threatened to hit me or gestured closely with a knife whilst knowing it made me uncomfortable, but like it didn't really hold any weight to it i feel like. Like I was never afraid she genuinely would. She constantly mocks my Tourette's Syndrome and says she has worse anxiety than me because she occasionally gets nervous. She has a habit of asking me one thing then asking someone another thing then telling me repeatedly in front of them that I gave her the wrong answer. She also always uses a high pitched mimicking voice when quoting me or someone else (usually my mom) even though she knows it causes me to freak out and start yelling over her for her to stop.\n\nShe only seems to dislike me and my mother. She is super nice to other people and extended family (who she has turned against me by telling them lies about me), but if she doesn't get her way over something stupid (like she did not like my eighth grade graduation outfit), she will scream and insult you until you start crying. She and my mother fight every time they are near each other, and it's ended in a few incidents that give me panic attacks (nothing physical happened).\n\nShe tends to use me for pity points because nothing's worse than a grandkid with TS, OCD, and anxiety. Like I used to be super close to her as a kid, but now I cannot stand talking to her. She cares about her religion more than my wellbeing, once wishing me dead before leaving me when I passed out in her church, and she's extremely homophobic (she is unaware about my mom and stepmom). She also goes between calling me too thin and explaining how specfic clothes I like are getting worn in certain areas because I'm getting too fat. I once told her I have an issue with anorexia, and after that's when the jump between me being too fat or thin comes in.\n\nShe also wants me to be completely dependent on her. Until 14, I was not allowed to use the microwave, oven, and stove without her supervision. I, a seventeen year old, am still not allowed to use the washing machine, dishwasher, and dryer, and if I do, she watches and decides I did something differently than her and begins to yell at me. Any chores she gives me have to be done in the exact manner and order she wants (which she never tells me what that is) and if I fail to do so, it leads to an argument. She also tells everyone how I'm such a lazy grandkid and burden to her friends then tells me she does so. Other times she goes off about how I'm her favourite person in the world and how I better like her and how my anxiety better not make me afraid of her.\n\nMy friends are getting kind of concerned because I have no self-confidence, second guess myself constantly, will sit in the pouring rain to avoid going home. They say she's abusive, but she's not physical (which I know isn't the only type of abuse). Like she feeds me and gives me cash sometimes, and maybe I'm the one whose bad idk anymore. I feel like she's just old rather than abusive. No adults believe me anyway or they just agree with her.\n\nSorry this was long, but anyone have an opinion on this?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It really did feel like breaking an addiction. I craved her. So I made a mistake and told her I\u2019d unblock her.\n\nWithin a day I came to regret it. I started out telling her I needed space and that we were definitely not together. Since then she\u2019s started trying to convince me that I just broke up with her because I\u2019m mentally ill, that the reasons I gave for breaking up with her either didn\u2019t happen or were misinterpreted by me, and that the real problem in our relationship was my being too afraid (of her, but she leaves that part out) to speak up when she said or did something hurtful.\n\nThe worst part? It\u2019s starting to work...\n\nOver the last few years she\u2019s told me so many horrible things about my friends and family, she\u2019s threatened me, she\u2019s guilted me, she\u2019s gaslit me, and pressured (on threat of castration of all things) me into proposing to her.

I made the mistake of telling her and now every day I hear about how that\u2019s actually why I did it, and how I was just ill. She tells me she wants me to get better specifically so we can get married. This only a week after telling her repeatedly that I needed space and she should move on. \n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this?

He was interested in another student (who had a boyfriend) and while he was working on stealing her away (which he has done to other girls before and takes a lot of pride in, red flag much), we had a \u201csituationship\u201d for a couple months (later I realized that it wasn\u2019t because he actually liked me, but because he couldn\u2019t take the loneliness while he waited for her). We actually got really close while he was love-bombing me because I had no idea he was a narc and thought we were both just really caring people. We spent almost every day together and talked on the phone for hours. We shared a lot of secrets and were there for each other a lot, etc.\n\n[Side note though, another retrospective red flag. How many of you guys notice that your narc keeps tabs on favors? I.e., whenever he would do something for me (buy me food, help me with something, ASK ME IF I NEEDED ANYTHING when I came over like... idk... a normal host?) he would say, \u201cI take care of you.\u201d Or \u201cI take care of you, don\u2019t I?\u201d Just like that. And he would say it like it was some kind of accomplishment. I realized later that he\u2019s just a tabs-keeper and this is a small example of that. Making sure he gave evidence that he was a \u201cgood person\u201d so he could screw me over in other ways. Man I could go on and on about this guy\u2019s narc red flags. But I digress.]\n\nAnyway like I said, we got really close while in the situationship, but one thing led to another and now the original girl he wanted broke up with her boyfriend. After that, I saw where this was going and told him I just wanted to be friends, even though I still had feelings for him, because I couldn\u2019t stand the idea of being discarded. Anyway, he is now dating her on the low (they\u2019re avoiding going public for the time being to avoid school drama. Idk). \n\nSince they started dating, I thought it best to keep my distance for a couple reasons. 1) I was hurt. He 100% chose her over me even though he insists it\u2019s not like that. 2) Once I got out of his orbit (you guys know what I\u2019m talking about) I was able to see him for what he really was. Self-obsessed, our agenda always centered on his errands/hobbies/cravings, empassioned rants where all you can do is sit there (mostly about politics), saying negative/mean things about strangers (I mean I have a dark sense of humor but he\u2019s on another level), excessively aware of how attractive/charming he is (you guys know what I mean on this too), his opinion is always right, etc etc etc. \n\nI don\u2019t want to be close friends with a person like that. On top of that, a person like that who would so blatantly use me and then debate his way out of any responsibility when I tried to call him out on it. \n\nI\u2019m happy to be friends at arms length, but not close friends. (I can\u2019t go NC because of school/mutual friends.) I told him I don\u2019t think we need to talk on the phone everyday anymore, for example. Especially while he\u2019s dating someone else, that just seems inappropriate.\n\nBut no. He insists we stay as close as we were before. He calls me almost every day (I haven\u2019t called him in at least a month). He either finds a school-related reason to call me or calls me about my life. I\u2019ve just been grey-rocking him. I haven\u2019t had the guts yet to just tell him I don\u2019t want to be so close anymore. I\u2019ve tried in subtle ways, and he won\u2019t just accept it. He\u2019s made the following arguments, among others. Making me feel crazy for even suggesting it.\n\n\u201cUs being involved before has nothing to do with our friendship\u201d \n\u201cWe were friends before any of that\u201d (we had been talking for 3 weeks before getting physical, don\u2019t know if that really counts as being friends before)\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it, I didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u201d *provides list of \u201cevidence\u201d for this claim that would make a law school graduate jealous*\n\nOf course, all of these arguments are based on the idea that the reason I wouldn\u2019t want to be friends is because he rejected me. Which honestly isn\u2019t the primary reason at all. The primary reason is because I figured out that he\u2019s a narcissist. I\u2019ve had more than one in my life before so I figured it out relatively quickly (though not quick enough clearly). He wants to be close friends so badly, having \u201cbest friends\u201d is really important to him. I don\u2019t have the guts to tell him I don\u2019t want to be close friends because of who he is as a person and not just because he rejected me. But I grey-rock and grey-rock and he won\u2019t leave me alone. \n\nThere\u2019s so much I\u2019m leaving out but any advice is appreciated. Either way it felt really good to type this all out. Part of his manipulation is that I\u2019m not allowed to tell any of our mutual friends (who were MY FRIENDS FIRST) anything about us being involved. So it feels good to blurt it out.

I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s what it was. We met at my work in my city, he lived about 2 hours away and was out with friends. Things moved super quick. He told me he never felt this way, loved me, yada yada after only a few dates. He showered me with little gifts and was incredibly thoughtful. He told me he was separated and going through a divorce. I had met his boss, friends, and spoken to his sister, so his claims seemed legitimate. Each time I questioned him with my concerns regarding his \u201cdivorce\u201d, he\u2019d turn the table on me. If he wanted to hang out and I was busy, he\u2019d show up wherever I was anyway. One of my jobs was done primarily from home, so he\u2019d bang on the door &amp;amp;amp; yell until I answered. I tried to end it multiple times because of his nasty behavior and what I felt was dishonesty regarding his relationship status. Every time I tried to walk away I\u2019d get bombarded with calls, texts, etc. When I blocked his number, he\u2019d make fake accounts on social media (he claimed to not have a personal account [he did]) to message me, or send me $1 on Venmo/Cash App with some anxiety-inducing message attached. I\u2019d eventually contact him. I was always wrong, crazy, bipolar, etc. He\u2019d frequently tell me out of nowhere he was \u201cworried about my mental health.\u201d I suffer from PTSD as a result of child abuse from my narc father, but feel I\u2019m fairly good at disguising it. I think he knew this statement triggered me. Eventually, I found out through a mutual acquaintance he was very much married (he\u2019d done something similar to her years ago - while engaged). His wife eventually contacted me. He told me not to say anything, \u201cit wasn\u2019t my business\u201d. I don\u2019t know why, but I was scared. He said we were in this together and, \u201cI loved the gifts so much, I must\u2019ve known.\u201d I told her the truth, but left out many details. I stopped seeing or talking to him.

I don\u2019t know why. Tonight he asked if we could hang out as friends. I don\u2019t whyI even humored the question, but I responded with a \u201cmaybe\u201d. Then out of nowhere he told me how he didn\u2019t want to be yelled at and critiqued by me. How it wasn\u2019t any fun. I never did that. I only critiqued him at the end when asking him to stop lying. I want to go NC, but there\u2019s this weird hold on me. Like, \u201cmaybe he\u2019s a good person now.

We had a small class but, even among the few of us, the first thing I noticed about him was how frequently he partied and had a new date with a new girl. We ended up becoming friends midway into the semester and from that point on the first of many, many toxic cycles initiated. The first \u201cdate\u201d we had resulted in sex and not much more. He was a virgin when we started college and told me, while still naked in his bed, that I \u201cmade number 34\u201d for him. Keep in mind, this was about 8 weeks from the mark of losing his virginity. I\u2019m not one to judge and honestly I really couldn\u2019t give a shit about the rendez vouz of others but telling a girl you just slept with what number she is, while admitting to the fact that you slept with that many people within a 2 month timespan threw me off. He had no remorse for the hurt that I was trying to hide. Our relationship became a game of cat and mouse and I\u2019ll let you take a guess who was the mouse here. He was adamant about not wanting to be in a relationship but he stayed up every night with me on 5-6 hour phone calls, texting me until the sun came up, sharing deep personal secrets. I felt so close to him. By Christmas, we had our first falling out and I went NC with him. This lasted until the end of the spring semester. We went back to our \u201cnormal\u201d (i.e., he treated me like a secret girlfriend while making it clear that he had no interest in the title of a relationship. Rinse and repeat. I learned to accept our relationship without labels because at least he would stay in my life for a few months at a time before the cycle repeated. If I could take it all back and say this was the one and only time, I would. But I can\u2019t. These are some of the things that happened following that initial cycle.. I would add all of them but I truly cannot remember at this point:\n\nStayed with me and my roommates until he was able to move in to his place at the beginning of the new year. Roommates mom was with us, asked her about her sex life. Was then banned from our apartment by my roommate who was trying her best to look out for me\n\nListening to stories of things that caused me pain/trauma/whatever in the past and used the same things against me\n\nWilled for an open relationship but was hurt and angered if I mentioned anyone else. Disclosed full detail of his sexual encounters.\n\nIntroduced me to another girl in his life by pointing at me across a busy walkway on campus and screaming \u201cESKIMO SISTERS\u201d \u2026in front of many people.\n\nWould call me to pick him up from parties with/without others and then complain to me about how a girl didn\u2019t want to sleep with him. While inviting me back in to sleep with him.\n\nSet me up with his best friend while we were on a break. Was upset when we began dating and not fucking. Cut us both off.\n\nTold people at a party with said best friend that she \u201cshould be grateful because \\[I\\] gave you the best thing I have to fuck\n\nConstant triangulation\n\nConstantly undervaluing me or discreetly shutting me down\n\nClaiming I was \u201cblue balling\u201d him when he didn\u2019t finish or I was too drunk to have sex\n\nReporting several times over several years (the last being in July) he has been diagnosed with sociopathic tendencies \u2013 more on this later\n\nHaving a party for himself when he had slept with 100 girls \u2013 note: number is not important, but again, would bother anyone a tinge when its around 160 and this is the person claiming that they \u201cwant you forever\u201d and \u201csee their eventual future with you\u201d side note: discussion of kids/home/future plans\n\nOne of the most bothersome to me \u2013 when I was in my upper years, I was sexually assaulted by the person who\u2019s apartment bedroom I was about to move into (was a friend of current roommate). Narc was the one that I called and told everything in detail to. I didn\u2019t open up about this for years and I still haven\u2019t talked about the full ordeal. He forgot about it and recently when I opened up about it with him when we were in a more serious place with our relationship he was stunned and I told him everything in full details. The specific phrase that this guy kept saying to me was later used against me when my narc and I would have sex which caused a great deal of anxiety.\n\nIn his younger years, he admitted to having a severe control problem. In our later years, and more recently, he would constantly tell me \u201cMine.\u201d Firmly during any intimate times\n\nWhat started as fetishes/fantasies later became a need for me to be seen as submissive. Anytime we would talk about sex (side note: LDR) he would explain in detail how he wanted to hog tie and torture me until I wasn\u2019t able to take it anymore. Im all for fun and games but he always wanted a position of power over me in a way where I was his object.\n\nConstant disappearing for days/weeks/months at a time without a word\n\nHUGE problems anytime I addressed by feelings of low self worth, something feeling off with our relationship, annoyance/hurt by his actions.. etc. It was best to leave it alone\n\nPost-college \u2013 in a cycle of dating, we made plans to spend our first Christmas together (\\*\\*my favorite day of the year is Christmas Eve and I still get a child-like excitement over it. He ruined that for me once before by calling me late on Christmas Eve and telling me I was cold and my heart was like ice. I had been reserved with him at the time over the way he was treating me) I rented a hotel for us for a Friday night and Saturday we had plans for me to meet the rest of his family and just lounge around watching movies and getting to know everyone. He was involved and excited over these plans. 10 minutes before I get to the hotel 3 hours away from home I get the \u201cwe need to talk when you get here.\u201d Text and not even 5 minutes after checking into the hotel and a massive panic attack later he broke up with me. And stayed the night/still fucked me while I was sobbing. Left at 7am.\n\nMost recently, we were together during the spring. One big thing to me is just enjoying each others company on special days (holidays/birthday/etc) and we had never been around on each others birthdays. Mine fell on a Saturday and I was over the moon that he was coming down to spend it with me. Nothing fancy, just a day between us and hanging out. He told me a week before on a weekend visit to him that he found out a few days prior he needed to leave town (he didn\u2019t, just took the excuse) and made plans to come down the weekend before. Plans set for the weekend. Best friend and her boyfriend wanted to come over and meet him too (huge step given everyone in my life despised the mention of his name by this point). He comes down, sleeps with me, talks with me for 20 minutes, breaks up with me. Leaves. Told me to do better than him. Happy birthday.\n\nI still wanted to be friends following the last breakup and we worked on it. He came down a month later before leaving on a trip for the remainder of the year. Rinse and repeat, it was intimate, etc etc. things were fine for awhile and we still almost felt like a couple. Plenty of mentions about the eventual future on his part and all that jazz. Started becoming distant later in the summer. I had my suspicions about someone else and confronted it. Denied it. Still 99% sure I was correct in those suspicions. However, he was SO hurt and upset that I had seen someone else during the NC period. This is where it got to the final straw. We had a 3 hour long call the last time we spoke and I started voicing my problems at his request. He started to get angry with me for keeping a \u201cscoreboard\u201d \u2013 I wasn\u2019t \u2013 and for the first time EVER I yelled at him and was visibly upset. After working through some things, he stated that he \u201cmissed me, \\[he\\] missed fucking me, he missed etc.. I called him out on it because I was tired of being treated like an object to fuck \u2013 something I heavily voiced throughout the whole duration of \u201cUs\u201d and he clarified that he meant it to be sweet but he isn\u2019t great with words. Duh. The next part got me. See, prior to this call I had found this sub after a phone call with the reminder that he was diagnosed by several people with \u2018sociopathic tendencies\u2019 only to find results for BPD and Narcissism. I knew he didn\u2019t have BPD but I began studying and I became obsessed. Holy shit. He was a covert narcissist to the T. While on this long call, I was making a mental checklist of red flags and he checked them all off. He had been outdoors with someone he just met on a hike a few days prior and I asked him about the trip. He told me in the coldest tone that \u201c\\[this guy\\] made a joke and its not even that it was mean but the fact that he directed it at me made me spend the rest of the day thinking of ways that I could throw him off the bridge or kill him.\u201d He segued into asking me in a new-to-me cold and flat voice if I \u201cwould tell anyone if \\[he\\] killed anyone.\u201d I asked if he had and he just laughed. I have never known this person. 2 months prior I would have told you with confidence this was the man I wanted to spend my life with through all the ups and downs. I had no idea who this person was. This wasn\u2019t the cold business-like conference call I would occasionally get. This felt like rage under the surface. He told me he was incapable of change and just a scared boy who didn\u2019t know what he wanted in life. That was it for me. I couldn\u2019t do the broken promises anymore. I couldn\u2019t do the constant nagging feeling that I wasn\u2019t enough or that something was \u201coff\u201d..the waiting for the switch to flip. He was my home. Now hes gone \u2013 again. And I think im going to be okay this time because I saw him for who he is.\n\nI want to chime in here that this isn\u2019t just a post to bash him for the shit he\u2019s done. I\u2019ve forgiven and moved past most all of it but recent. I am not 100% fault free here either. Was I an enabler? Maybe. Did I blatantly ignore red flags and good advice from people who had my best interest at heart? Absolutely. But I can honestly tell you that in several years of this cycle, I had one big fault on my end. And I do mean one. (im not one to challenge confrontation or start arguments here. Forgiver/Forgetter to my own dismay) I am fairly open about the fact that I have bipolar disorder. I have been through the ringer with it and I have in \\*mostly\\* well under control these days after several self-destructive years. Back in college, I was very impulsive and 90% of the time, pretty suicidal. I called him late one night on an OD attempt and he had the paramedics sent to my house to stabilize me. He never forgave me for it. I will own up to my full capacity here that it was a \\*shitty\\* thing to do to someone else and I am very remorseful for many things in that era of life, but that one is in the top 3 of things I can\u2019t forgive myself for. The conversation during my \u201cbirthday\u201d weekend was due to the fact that I had expressed that I still feel those invasive thoughts sometimes but I have no intention to carry out that plan ever again. He became obsessive that I was going to suddenly kill myself and told me that he and his brother agree that I need therapy ASAP. Therapy isn\u2019t my cup of tea and makes me uncomfortable quite frankly and I dismissed this with reasoning. He couldn\u2019t accept that as an answer and ended it abruptly. After time away from him, I realized that my depression and anxiety and invasive thoughts of self-harm or SI were SIGNIFICANTLY decreased. It was almost immediate. He was pushing those feelings whether he recognized it or not. I feel stable and well since going NC.\n\nI know this list is long and it could be a book at this point but like I said earlier, Im at a place I cant even recall everything that has happened between us at this point. Its just too damn long and still stings just that much.\n\nI don\u2019t hate him. I don\u2019t wish him unwell. Trauma bonds and memories aside, I do love him as a person and I hope he finds his peace one day. I needed a place to release this so I can finally let it all go. I appreciate everyone in this sub who has brought me unfathomable peace and healing when I didn\u2019t know where to turn. I appreciate anyone who has taken time to read my vent and helped me let go. I won\u2019t wait around for someone to decide that I deserve to be treated with respect. I am ready to respect myself first. I am grieving this as a loss of someone that didn\u2019t truly exist. Hopefully, anyone that reads this and can resonate can understand that you are worth so much more than the hatred these relationships make you feel. Love is real. Peace is real. Its all within you \u2013 love yourself first.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I understand that the persona of the narc is fake, that the mask is fake and that the emotions the narc may have said they had towards you are fake. However, this is where my rant is. It crushes my soul everytime I see the discriptor of the relationship being \"fake\" because for me, on my part, no matter how awful the abuse I suffered was, my part in the relationship, my emotions, my experiences, were not fake. Early on I discovered what narcissism was and that my nex has npd. I was already very much trauma bonded by that time. I still believe that I chose to love my nex, faults, abuse and all and stay in the relationship with him. I believe he is my soul mate even if he doesn't believe the same. I tried so damn hard to find a way to set my boundaries, learned everything I could about npd, went to couples counseling, solo counseling, found outside emotional support etc. to learn how to live with a person who has npd because even after the mask slipped, even after he made my life hell for the last few months leading up to the discard, I loved him with everything I had left of me. I still see the good in him. At his very core, he is a good person with bad behavior. So when someone says \"oh honey, move on it was all fake\" I get angry and isolate myself even more, close people out who I feel don't really understand, and shut down because it feels so dismissive of everything I felt and experienced in my relationship. I know that to most of you my words above will sound like classic trauma bonding, and let's be honest, they probably are somewhat, but I cannot brush off a 3 year relationship with someone I saw a future with, someone I dreamed of having children with, building a life with, standing at the alter with, buying a house with, as fake.

I know that experiencing it in real life is hard enough, but I find myself wishing I could observe it as an outsider. The nuances of abuse such as manipulation, gaslighting, and triangulation etc are difficult to parse when it's happening to me but when watching it happen on screen with actors or other people it's a lot easier to 'spot' and understand. \n\nI'm not talking about sharing videos or audio of your narc - please don't do that - but scenes and audio from movies, television, documentaries, podcasts, social media and the like. Are there any you've encountered that have been helpful to you, or do you find these kinds of stories and scenes in media too hard to watch?\n\nHere's one: I watch a Japanese reality TV show called Terrace House. The premise is that six young people share a house somewhere in Japan, living together while working on their dreams and finding love (and being filmed). It's usually calm and cute, but last season (Opening New Doors) there was a girl who at first portrayed herself as sweet, pure and innocent, but over time revealed herself to be vindictive, egocentric, manipulative, and self-righteous. Sound familiar? There's a span of episodes during which you can watch her spin a web of lies and drama around the other housemates, and I was BLOWN AWAY watching almost exactly what happened to me happen between real people on screen. I actually cried for the housemate who was her target. Watching scenes unfold I was able to pick out when she was being manipulative, when she was flipping the script, when she was triangulating, when she was attempting to gaslight. Not everyone in the house caught on to her by the end - some of them acted like flying monkeys - but thankfully the audience could see how nasty she was and she's remembered as the worst TH housemate ever. It was disturbing but illuminating to witness, and I feel that I actually learned something about how to spot emotional abuse from it.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The breakup happened in a  horrible way, as you can except from a narc, and we stayed in contact for almost 6 months afterwards. I'm only 18, and I guess I was inexperienced with relationships and especially with toxic people. Either way, luckily I blocked her and got into no contact, around the end of May/ beginning of June this year.\n\n So I just wanted to write this post as an update on my life since then, in what ways the abuse still affects me, etc. \n\nFirst of all, I have a new girlfriend. We've been together for a few months now and she's really great. She cares about me a whole lot, and she wants to hear about the abuse and talk about it with me, which helps me a great deal. \n\nAnother thing I can gladly say is that I barely ever think of my nex anymore. The only times she comes to my mind is when I notice how the abuse still affects me now and then, which I suppose is natural. And thank god I never think of her other than of what shit she did to me. So I think it's fair to say I basically never think of her anymore, which is great! When we broke up, I thought I'd never recover, so here's a note for you all who are still in the cycle: there's a light at the end of the tunnel, even if you don't believe it now, you'll see. You CAN recover from narcissistic abuse, no matter how long it takes.\n\nNow, the reason why I wrote this is because some consequences of the abuse still affect me sometimes 'till this day. Therefore, I would like to ask you all for advice if you have any to give me:\n\nNarcissistic abuse affects you in a lot of ways. In some ways, it even affects the way you behave, the way you think, and the way you act. The main, most obvious effect that I have from that is being extremely indecisive when it comes to decisions in my relationship. \n\nLet me tell you about the abuse around this topic first: \n\nWhenever I wanted to do something with my nex, whether it was playing videogames, talking, cuddling, having (one-sided) sex, going somewhere, literally ANYTHING you can imagine that I wanted to do together... she'd often be mad about it. Out of nowhere. Followed by something like 'you're egocentric, you never care about what I want, you only care about yourself, etc etc.' \n\nOf course, the first time that happened, I was confused and didn't really change. But as you all probably know, narcs slowly change you by changing their behaviour step by step. It starts off pretty okay, then they get harsher and harsher. So slowly, I began to apologise. This might sound childish and stupid, but we even made a deal that, whenever I wanted to do something with her, sometimes even alone, I needed to ask for her permission (God knows why I ever agreed to that, I hit rock bottom lmao). \n\nI guess I agreed to it because I thought, as many others who suffer from this, that if I followed her wishes, that she'd change and become the person she was during the first months of our relationship. Of course that never happened, luckily. On the contrary: \n\nAfter following her wishes for a while, she decided that suddenly, \"I'm so dull. I'm not making any decisions, I don't take any action\". \nThen of course when I tried again to make decisions, which was hard because I had to constantly walk on eggshells, she never agreed to it.  This went on, and on, and on...\n\nI think this process hit rock bottom when I was in her city, around two weeks before our breakup, and she wanted to go to the shopping center, to do Christmas shopping for her family. I asked her if she'd want to go together, and then she kept stirring around the pot, first saying 'no' and then 'yes', and then 'no',... you know how it goes. I think that discussion (about basically nothing!) kept going on for about an hour, 'till she suddenly said 'okay, I'm going to the shoppingcenter. If you're not here in 10 minutes, I'm leaving without you.' \n\nI lived in a hostel because I'm not from there, about 30/40 minutes walking to her apartment. Stupid me decided to follow her anyways, and I ran. I ran like a motherfucker, and I got there in 10 minutes, only to see that she already took a taxi to go to the shopping without me. Anyways, this story is getting too long, point is, I ran for almost an hour long, by far the longest I've ever ran, only to be ignored for the rest of the entire day. \n\nMy point is, this really affected me and my mental health a LOT. And even though I don't have any contact with my nex anymore, and I'm in a loving, healthy relationship, and I'm very conscious of the fact that my girlfriend is nothing like my nex, I'm still very, very scared of making decisions regarding my relationship. I'm scared to take initiative and make decisions, because I'm afraid that my partner won't like what I choose to do. \n\nAs I said, I know that my girlfriend would never get mad at me or punish me in whatever way because of something I decide to do together, but subconsciously, I guess my mind is still in the old mindset about this, because of the long story I just told you. I don't really know what to do about it, so I'd like any help or advice you can give me. Thanks for reading this far if you have, sorry for the long post, this is like therapy for me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I've been taking time to work on processing and accepting the situation that I am in so that I can move on to the next steps of freeing myself and recovery - and I've been mourning the loss of the \"perceived partner\" that I was fooled into believing existed. And its not that I haven't worked through these thoughts at all before, I have been for some time (I'm unable to leave at the moment due to multiple circumstances but when the moment arrives I want to be exceptionally prepared to seize it) but something about the level of acceptance that I had this morning felt..beautifully crushing? If that makes any sense.\n\nSitting there with my, quickly cooling, coffee and fighting back tears for the loss of the person I so deeply believed existed not only hurt immensely but also broke through a seal that allowed me to view my NPartner for whom they really are: a monster.

I don\u2019t drink myself to sleep anymore. I have great conversations with friends who I had isolated myself from because of my nex.

Some days I wake up from nightmares about things being ok, them walking through the door apologizing and saying they made a great mistake. I cry in the shower a few times a week. I dread the day when the house is signed over to me, because I know that there will be at least one more moment of contact. I have trouble leaving my house until I have to go to work because I\u2019m scared (I can\u2019t tell you why exactly I\u2019m frozen sometimes, but I am). I feel lonely. I joined some apps just to see what\u2019s out there, only to find myself frustrated thinking that I will never, ever be able to get over the addiction to the monster that left my life. \n\nThe person who left you (or you left) who was manipulative, narcissistic, controlling, mean and who used you until you were nearly nothing is NOT the person you love or did love. That person doesn\u2019t exist anymore and they most likely never did. These people are chameleons, they warp and change to whoever they are with or around next. You loved someone. Your feelings are completely validated. But that person doesn\u2019t exist any longer. \n\nIt was always going to end this way. No matter what you said, did, the actions you took, no matter how many times you back track. It was always going to end this way. \n\nIf they were sorry you would know. If they felt remorse, they would be telling you. If they thought they had a problem, they would be getting help. If they loved you they would not have done this to you. If they cared about anyone else in the world besides themselves... do you think you\u2019d be in this place right now?\n\nJust wanted to let anyone know who is struggling that you\u2019re not alone. I don\u2019t think I have good days and bad days. Sometimes it\u2019s good hours and bad hours. It\u2019s up and down. Sometimes it is so painful I want to hide away and drink and disappear.

I was severely bullied (including here sexual harassment/ objetification and body shame, although since it wasn't explicit r//pe it doesn't count for most people) during my teen years. This makes me feel ''uncomfortable'' when I'm on a group of people and I'm feeling beautiful/sexy myself.

I froze and I started to tremble. This doesn't happen with my closest friends/family, they are always very supportive of me and I feel secure. But I have a group in class that act like your typical ''lol cringe'' dudes and they really trigger me, they remind me of my high school peers.\nI felt so scared omg, although my rational brain understands that people usually doesn't care about what you do or what you wear. The emotional pain is still there. I froze because inside my mind there were two opposite forces fighting: self love with rational mind as a support soldier vs intrusive thoughts from trauma.\n It's just... I wish I could wear more open clothes without feeling like a sl/t. It's like my mind objectifies me automatically. But I guess I'm doing baby steps to show my real self, my rational mind never defended me until now (there was a little voice inside of me saying ''you know you can do it, you must resist the urge to undress, you know you love the clothes''). \nI could tell this story to my friends/family but I don't want them to validate me (because I already know they see me as beautiful), I NEED to be my own emotional couch.

He has 4 children with 4 different women, one of which was underage when they began dating. She was murdered in 2018 and he chose not to take custody over the child. Over the course of 4 years, i sent him over 2000 pornographic photos, videos, and messages. No one was aware of this relationship as i kept it a secret until i was 18. We didnt meet in person until i was 18. When i was 19, i moved out to him in person. I lived there for 3 months before i moved back home and broke up with him. I am now 20 and still very upset about this whole situation. I cheated on him when i was 19 and left him multiple times for younger men. I cant help but think the reason our relationship failed is because of my actions. I was very happy with him when things were good. We were very compatible in most ways. But, he was not considerate of my mental health issues and was no support whatsoever. I often felt very alone with him. He didnt like physical affection and began to lose sexual interest in me as i got older. If i wanted to do anything but stay home, he got suspicious that i was cheating (even before i cheated) and it would cause huge fights. I recently filed a police report on him but have not heard anything back. Even if i do, i still believe i am mostly to blame for staying with him for so long. I have nightmares about him often and wake up in night sweats and with severe depression. When i was trying to get some of my things back a few weeks ago, he said he would only return them if i sent him pornographic videos. I dont know what i saw in this man. He is the definition of a deadbeat. He was near homeless, jobless and didnt have a car when i first met him. But, that doesnt stop me from occasionally missing what we had before i messed everything up a year ago. I wish i could get over those thoughts but they keep coming back. I just want to move on from this. I revolved my entire life around him, choosing not to move away for college where i wanted to and lying for years. My life plan was to move out there and be with him. Now i have no idea what to do with my future. I am in college, but depressed and unsure about what to do with the rest of my life. I haven't been able to keep a job and can barely get to class every day because of the depression and terrible thoughts of him.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I admit I took part in this for a couple of weeks before I started seeing what he was doing and for that I am ashamed. What clued me in to what he was doing was when I showed up to out hangout, he told me we needed to talk, and then someone I didn't know insulted me out of nowhere. I'm not an idiot, I know what that was about. So I talked to him one on one to find out what that was about, apologize, and set things right. I also told him that I wasn't going to be around if he was going to keep this up.\n\nI am (or was) the oldest member of this group and he used to ask me for relationship advice constantly, and I always gave him the same answer \"Don't.\" He had a been trying to get with his female friends and girls that hang in our group and I always told him that was a really bad idea and tried to get him to focus on college instead. He didn't like that too much and instead of coming to me he told all of them that I was gossiping about them maliciously behind their backs. I was not and everything I said could be said to that person.\n\nThis leads me to today.... I figured I would give him a second chance and show up to our hangout to say hi and then leave. You ever get that feeling that people have been talking crap about you behind your back because they stop talking and won't look at you? That happened. I said hi, told him I had to leave, and he signalled got a friend I've never even seen before to go off on me. I just left. After that I messed up by texting him \"nice try\" and about how I was done with him. He proceeded to pass his phone around to all of my friends so they could tell me off through texting. I called him out on his BS (very calmly) and told them what he had been doing, and said that this was a smear campaign I didn't want any part of. I got shamed for it and told that no one likes me. \n\nI really don't care if those people don't like me, but I can't help but feel a little hurt the way things went down. But I started seeing signs that this person was toxic before this happened and I've been through other smear campaigns. The last time that happened my BPD ex turned another group of friends against me after I exposed her for cheating and they took her side. I just decided to stay away from them and not let them collect any more diet on me.

I will be OK no matter what but I can't believe I trusted someone who went around building a case against me so they could turn others against me again.

Sure, there's always a few assholes, but they never had an audience of over dozen people participating.

On top of that, he had matches on every dating site you could think of in his emails. I facetimed this girl and showed her proof that I was with him because she didn't believe me. I confronted him and of course he denied everything and said he met her when we were broken up and saw her once, but it turns out he's been in a long-distance relationship with her for seven months while dating me. \nI ended up leaving him and though he cried like a baby and begged me to stay. I told him that I knew this girl and she told me everything and gave me screenshots of their conversation, I told him she was playing him and that we actually became best friends because of him. \n\n\nThis girl was pretty upset that he was playing her, she told me she was literally going to leave everything in her city to come live with him and thanked me for calling her. She came up with an idea of playing him and getting him back for what he did. She wants me to come visit her in December and when my ex goes visits her then, for us to both be there and chew him out. I told her December is too far out I'm going to move on by then and I never want to see him again and I don't want to part of her game. But she insisted and got mad and said not to ruin my plans. She told me never to tell him that she still talks to me and tells me everything. \n\nI have been talking to her for 2 months here and there and she is still talking to him everyday and playing him along. He keeps asking if she still talks to me and telling her not to communicate with me and that I'm the bad guy and the cheater. So overtime she started sending me screenshots of their conversation but only when he says I love you, or something sexual. She started sending me clips of the phone conversation what he  said about me and started randomly sending me pictures of him that he sends her.\n\nSo the more I talk to her the more I get confused, and start to pay attention to things.. Why is she only sending certain things to me?? I don't ask for them! What is her motive behind this? She also told me to send her proof of texts or phone calls or recordings if he tries to come back to me. Also she told me she has a boyfriend that she's been dating for 2 years that she's going to get married too. \n\nSince she has a boyfriend.. now I don't know who's playing who. Before I knew she had a boyfriend, she told me she was going to drop everything at home to come live with my ex, but I'm thinking you would never leave a guy that you known for 2 years over a guy you know for a month right?? So what's really going on here?  Plus who has patience to play someone for 3 months just to get them back while having a boyfriend \n\nWhat if they are both in on this and they both playing me?? Are they both playing each other? Did they do all this just so he could get rid of me to be with her? none of this makes sense! It's insane. She showed me the screenshot that he bought airline ticket to go see her in December. So he's good for sure to see her even though he knows she's playing him! None of this makes sense.! \n\nIs he making her send me all this stuff so I don't move on?? Is he making her do this to make me jealous? Is he sending her this stuff because he knows she's going to show me anyway even though he tells her not to tell me? Do you see how confused I am?

I don't quite know where to start but all I know is that I am really, really struggling. I got out of my emotionally abusive relationship in December of 2018. The relationship lasted for roughly 2 years, and while I won't go in to detail about the abuse, I will say that it is affecting my life now, and especially my new relationship, immensely. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore getting into my relationship with my ex I was a bubbly, lively, confident and outgoing, social person. I am realizing now just how much the abuse has robbed me of those things. I barely recognize myself anymore. Just typing that out is making me sob already. Immediately after the break up, I felt great. I felt free, I was going out with my friends again, and it felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. That lasted for maybe around 5-6 months. I kept myself busy during this time, and was genuinely feeling like my old self again. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got into a relationship back in June with the most amazing guy. Of course, my guard was up a bit in the beginning as I know I am fragile and still in the healing phase, but things were, and still are, so great with my new guy. He treats me right, isn't a jealous control freak, doesn't need to know my whereabouts 24/7, doesn't undermine my feelings (my ex used to say I was always playing the victim card), and is generally just so supportive, loving, and kind (among many others-- he's truly great, I am so in love with him). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings took a turn, and have been pretty bad for the last month or so. It was like I got hit out of no where. Here I am in a healthy relationship, now ridden with anxiety. Relationships used to come so easily to me in the past, now I find myself questioning his sincerity, questioning my trust for him. Almost as if my ex rubbed off on me. That thought makes me so sick. I can't even explain. Physically nauseous.  Also,  I am someone who prides myself off of maintaining healthy communication. Nope-- not now. I find myself subconsciously keeping things bottled up inside. If something is bothering me, I don't want to tell my boyfriend. The logical explanation to this is because whenever I tried to bring things up to my ex, it was met with immediate dismissal, so I taught myself to keep quiet.  I have flashbacks and nightmares about my last relationship. I wake up feeling so uneasy, and can't shake it for a few days. It is debilitating. I feel like my chest is crushing me from the outside in. I have never felt this way before. So out of control of my own emotions. I am really scared. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScared, but also I can't help but feel so angry that I was put through that. I think part of why this is all coming up now, is that by being in a new relationship that is actually healthy, it is allowing me to finally see how  wrongly I was treated. It is finally bringing to light things that maybe I was too blind to see back then. But I see it all now. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI need to see someone. I know that I can't try to navigate this on my own. I feel so helpless right now. I cry every time I think about it. Basically every night. This is not who I want to be. I really need to shake this.

With the job he had he was on call, but could never ask for time to spend with me so I was known for going alone places. He was content living in my fathers house, not paying rent, and spending money on car stuff. My N is a very jealous person even before the affair. I had no physical contact with this other person, but exchanged messages and photos. \n\nHe makes me feel like I walk on eggshells. \n\nHe proposed to me after we made amends during my training.

CREEPY MUCH?? anyway, last i\u2019ve heard about him is he\u2019s telling everyone that i \u201cwrongly accused him of rape\u201d and he lives with his mommy (who thinks he\u2019s an angel who can do no wrong) and says he\u2019s \u201ctoo depressed\u201d to get a job. the thing is, he\u2019s not depressed. at all. he still goes everywhere else in hell and creation, but \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d work. anyway, i\u2019m done ranting here. sorry that it\u2019s so out of order... i\u2019m a bit loopy from my pain meds from another surgery. it feels so good letting it all out. thank you, reddit.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Well... it did happen, and the first few visits were...ugh to say the least. A few of them we had argued, and of course he pulled his shit like he always did. It's gotten to a point in our arguments, if we argue that I can identify his tactics and sometimes it's really funny. For example I can hear what he's saying and know that in 3, 2, 1... gas light, and then after the gas lighting he does his guilt trip, and so on and so forth until he gets really pissed and uses insults or name calling. He really is stupid and immature. Anyway... he has been coming out to visit our son every Friday since March and its been going okay most of the time, but only when in public or at the park that is close to my Mom's place. \n\nThese visits were going okay until the days where he was visiting with our son in his car. He would tell our son things like  he is a bad boy for living with his Mommy, Aunt, Uncle and Grandmother. He would tell him that he was stupid, bad, and all manner of awful things. This is where the visits in public and at the park started so that  they weren't confined to my exes car and could get out and round. My ex says he is \"intimidated\" by my brother and I being present. I call bull shit. \n\nI have since applied for welfare and because of that I had to apply for child support, which I really didn't want to do because I know that my ex, because he said it, won't pay child support -- which if he doesn't he will get jailed and fined, then have to pay the back pay on child support, I was told. I don't know though, because he has to have been served by now, and he hasn't said a word. I would have been sure that he would have done something, said something by now. I don't know what he's playing at, but I don't like it. I know that he will try to hold this over my head some how. Idk, it freaks me out.\n\nOutside of the child support thing, the worst thing is that seeing him stresses me out so much I have insomnia like once a week the night after, or before he comes over to see our son and it wrecks my sleep schedule. I have a job now, and I work from 9AM to 3 or 4 PM, and have to wake up by at least 7:30 at the earliest to shower, and I can't afford my sleep to get so out of whack. It bothers me. It really sucks to have to get my sleep schedule back on track just to wreck it again at the end of the week. \n\nIn other news though... I don't jump so hard at an aggressively opened door anymore, I guess that's a positive. I've also started \"shopping\" for a therapist. I'm terrified of seeing a therapist because I had a bad experience with one in the past, so it makes it hard to look for one, and trust one now... but that is a whole different story.\n\nI just wanted to update everyone since it's been a while since I posted, and my last post was made in cold panic, I didn't want anyone to think anything super bad (like murder) had happened to me. I know... that probably sounds... narcissistic, but if anyone was worried, which I don't know if anyone was... I thought I'd let people know I'm still alive.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

He stopped once I started crying and was very mad at me. \n\n-He pulled my hand very hard to force me to touch him even though I was pulling back as hard as I could. I don\u2019t think this is rape but I\u2019m not sure if it is sexual assault. \n\n-I consented to oral sex and was giving it to him. He got behind me and started taking my jeans off. I said \u201cno\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t\u201d \u201cstop\u201d. I didn\u2019t physically resist.

Afterward he told me that it wasn\u2019t rape and that nobody would believe me if I said it was.

Then the therapist asked if I would be willing to work on the relationship if there was no abuse - or if I was out for good.\n\nI told her the truth - that if I could have our relationship without the abuse I think there are enough good times to fight for and I would be willing to work on that. But if you ask me to make a decision today, I'm out. I don't want this relationship.\n\nThe therapist seemed to understand, asked me to leave again and called my husband back in to talk to him one-on-one again.  In about 10 min I was called back in.\n\nThe therapist told me that my husband had a lot of appointments in the upcoming week and it would be a very stressful time for him so it would be best just to lay low until they were over.  And Im not 100% sure because I got very upset at that point and started crying but I know at some point I blurt out \"So we aren't making a decision if we are working on the relationship or separating until next week?\"  (it was honestly so hard to ask this, i don't know why)\n\nThe therapist says \"Good Question.\" and looks at my husband, who says \"Yes, and until then I would like to minimize contact as much as possible\". He did offer to have a meeting at some point if there was important household stuff to discuss.  He looked so angry. I  did not ask why.  Later he said it was because he wasn't looking forward to the dr appointments (to the therapist, not to me)\n\nI cried a bunch more, we talked a little bit if I had places to go or people to talk to or whatever. At some points we all just sat in silence. IDK as I said when I get emotional my brain stops remembering things :) The therapist scheduled the appointment for next week.  EDIT:  At one point I know I said \"I just had different expectations for coming back in here. I thought we'd both agree to work on the relationship and discuss the next steps, but I get it its a big week for you so ill try to leave you alone even though its hard for me, its just not who I am as a person\".  No response from my husband, but I wasn't looking at him either.\n\nWe had driven separate cars so he got home first, as I hit some traffic.  When I got home he greeted me.  He asked me where the box cutter was; I answered him and since I saw an opening I asked him some business questions and we talked shop for about 5 min.  Then he told me he had ordered 2 pad thais, and would I like one. I was hungry so I accepted.  We ate dinner, we discussed chores which he said he would do in 1/2 hour.\n\nI went upstairs unsure how to proceed. I came down later and offered to help with the chores since he seemed to be amiable earlier but he declined my help (politely).  After that though, I've just been hiding in my room playing video games trying to follow the \"little contact\" rule even though if it was me I'd just wanna talk it out right now :\\\\", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I mean, to realize now that I  am an adult?\n\nMy mom used to beat me up on a regular basis  since I was very little. There are things I blocked  and are now coming back, like one time she  pushed me down the stairs when I was around  4, or a couple times she didn\u2019t send me to  school claiming that I was sick, but the truth  was I had bruises on me. She called  me all sorts  of names and yelled at me all the time, making  me believe I was crazy. She would continually  talk about herself as a victim because he had to  do house chores and take care of me. \n\nWhen I was a teenager there were a couple  times where she threw me on the floor and  kicked me a bunch, dragged me down the stairs  by my hair, and just hit me all over my body. One  of those times I was covered in bruises and I  was going to go to the police, and she called me  a bunch of times crying and saying that she  loved me. \n\nThese are things that I can remember if I give an  effort, but I had mostly forgotten all of it. I am  not sure why, but it just hit me that I grew up  being  abused. I guess when I think of abuse, I  think of a family that is stereotypically  dysfunctional, children with broken arms and  deeply wounded, whereas what happened to me  was not the kind of stuff you see on tv. My  household was what most people would call  normal, in fact she was always the first parent to  go to conferences with my teachers and was  super involved in my schools. It was the kind of  household nobody would think to call CPS on.\n\nMy younger sister witnessed this stuff and she  suffered some emotional abuse, but my mom  didn\u2019t hit her or at least we don\u2019t remember  instances of violence against her. Does this  happen often? One child being abused while the  other is mostly left alone. \n\nI am completely new to this notion and I don\u2019t  know what behaviors are typical on people that  grew up like I did, I have bipolar disorder type 2  and I wonder how much of my depressions and  hard times are related to trauma. I am pretty  sure that my fear of abandonment, lack of  confidence, low self esteem and always looking  for love in boyfriends have a lot to do with what  happened to me. I can\u2019t really afford to go to  therapy and I don\u2019t know about other resources  out there, I\u2019m not sure if I am ready to go to a  support group and sharing this, for some reason  I feel extremely embarrassed of admitting it.\n\nAnybody have any similar experiences? Any  suggestions? Anything will be appreciated.\n\nThank you friends", "subreddit": "abuse"}

You never know which one you get, or why. It just happens, and it is always without exception my fault. \n\nToday is the perfect example of how it usually goes. I feel down (I have depression, anxiety, misophonia, all stuff that prevents me from just randomly waking up happy), so I message him. As usual, conversation dies down immediately after he told me what he wanted to tell me, never waiting for a reply or anything. So I ask him if he doesn\u2019t want to talk. Immediately he starts accusing me of not talking to him enough (for every message he sents, he has 10) and accusing him of not texting me enough. Like, dude, chill. So I explain to him my anxiety causes me to ask this since I want to know where I stand. I don\u2019t want to message him a ton with him getting annoyed at me for bothering him when he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me (we\u2019ve been together for a long and excruciating 2,5 years now, so shit he already knows but just doesn\u2019t care about). \n\nThe scared girl in me starts to explain to him it was nothing he did, but that I was just having a hard time. He just glossed over it and started talking about a friend of his, asking me to look up stuff for this guy, completely ignoring my pleading for help. I tell him again that I need help, and he just asks me bluntly what he\u2019s supposed to do about it. I tell him exactly what I need, which is met with a subjectchanging.\n\nI confronted him after asking for support for a 4th time, and of course, how inconsiderate of me. I should\u2019ve asked him how HE was doing instead of being so selfish and asking for help, since HE was doing poorly as well (all of a sudden, after this morning texting me he felt amazing). And that it was very disrespectful of me to come at him like that, since he lost his father in february (they weren\u2019t exactly close and often fought, which is a long and complicated story. Never ever EVER did I downplay what he went through, and I even took care of the cremation, wrote the speech, the card, EVERYTHING. A thank you? Nah). Take note that his father only comes up after he mistreated me as a get out of jail free ticket. I also just wanted to fight in his opinion, and was just being the crazy delusional piece of work I had been from day one.\n\nNow it was my turn to fly off the handle. I am SICK of him calling me crazy everytime I tell him he did something wrong. He just says he did what he could and if that wasn\u2019t enough than I was a bad person for expecting him to give me more than he was able to. He left for work and left me crying and defeated in a corner, telling me that \u201cif I were willing to stop acting like a psycho crazy person and got my act together, he\u2019d still be there waiting with loving open arms\u201d. So once again, he is the samaritan that is willing to put up with a delusional crazy psycho bitch whose only purpose in life is to make his a living hell.\n\nWhy do I stay with him?

I had a sudden realization last night that has been a big eye-opener and I feel like I need to get out. I realized that almost everything I've ever apologized for throughout the past two years is just my reaction to something SHE did. It's like I'm apologizing for having feelings...Take a look at these three examples and let me know how in the world I'm supposed to get out of this: \n\n\\-I saw a message from her ex (a notification popped up on her phone when it was in front of me) and told her it made me uncomfortable that she was still talking to him...she responded by telling me how hurt she was that I didn't trust her...I end up apologizing. \n\n\\-I lost a big deal at work that cost me $20k and didn't want to do anything but sit inside when I came home. I was really upset and felt like a failure....She got mad that I didn't want to go for a walk with her. She said \"I'm just upset because I was really looking forward to going on a walk and just because something happened to YOU, now we can't. You know, I need to start looking after myself and doing the things I want to do.\"....I end up apologizing. \n\n\\-My younger brother was diagnosed with cancer and was in the hospital for surgery. I drove 10 hours (where he lives) to be there with him and my family. My girlfriend couldn't take the time off work, and I understood that, no problem there. When I was gone though, she did a terrible job of supporting me emotionally. She was hard to get in touch with and even when we did talk, she honestly didn't sound too concerned about what was going on. It really rubbed me the wrong way. Also, I found out that one of the nights I was gone, she had one of her girlfriends over to our place and she brought her boyfriend and another guy with who was \"dating someone\" but idk. The four of them drank at our place and went out on the town for the night (I don't suspect she cheated - but who knows). I was extremely hurt and let her know it. She couldn't talk to me because she was partying?! I hated that. When I confronted her about it, I definitely raised my voice at her but I was emotional for a number of reasons. I did not say anything hurtful or crude to her though, I just yelled at her because I was so hurt. I said things like \"Why the hell is it so hard for you to just care about me and what's going on?!?!\" and then I hung up on her we didn't talk until the following day...When I finally called the next day, she started crying and told me she didn't deserved to be treated so poorly for doing nothing wrong and that she was extremely hurt because I yelled at her. She told me that her mom and sister are upset with me too because of how poorly I treated her.....Somehow, someway, I ended up having to apologize for treating her poorly. \n\nThat's three examples of probably 40 that I could list where it's the same pattern. She does something that hurts me, I confront her, she flips it, I apologize. I know it's easy to say I just leave but I feel as if I'm trapped.

He was the greatest human I\u2019d ever met for the first 2 years, during which I was financially carrying us while he moved up in his career. When I had our daughter, my business slowed a bit and his company sent him to work out of state for a year. It was such a hard time for me financially and after 6 months, he finally began paying pretty much all the bills. This is when the mask really came off. As soon as he got that control over me, I lost all worth in his eyes, he would tell me how lazy and irresponsible I am constantly (for being home with our daughter and working only 3 nights/week) If I needed help with any of my personal bills, he\u2019d tell me to figure it out and then just go spending HIS money on whatever he wanted to get. I was expected not to get angry or irritated bc it was his and would say things like \u201cWe will never be partners until you\u2019re bringing home what I am ever week\u201d. Call me a piece of shit on a regular basis. When I decided to go back to school, he made it nearly impossible for me to study. So he looked down on me for not working enough but when I tried starting a career, that was also bad. Complete insanity. Anyway, I stayed on this rollercoaster for 3 years doing everything I could think of to help get back what we had in the beginning until I searched his \u201csymptoms\u201d one day and realized he was a narcissist. It took me a solid year to actually leave. \n\nThe leaving part has been the most devastating event in my life other than losing a child. Obviously, that takes the cake, but this breakup is no fucking joke! No one could\u2019ve prepared me for this. I have not gotten off the rollercoaster. It feels like I\u2019ve only given him freedom and made everything harder on myself. While intellectually, I know that\u2019s not true, it feels that way. My children are doing very well though. They\u2019re actually sleeping. My daughter has never been a big sleeper. I would always joke that she was like a vampire. She\u2019s now asleep by 930 every night and sleeps through, she\u2019s done this since the first night we were out. I can see how bad the energy in that house must have effected them and I didn\u2019t see that before. Me though? Not as good. I\u2019m terrified to fight him in court. I do have the means for an attorney and a pretty great one on deck, but man the thought of him having our daughter alone makes me sick to my stomach. He has sexual abuse history that has never been dealt with and now his son also has been abused and has not gotten any treatment for it and I\u2019m terrified she\u2019s going to be exposed. My son always watched her when I was working and my ex was the parent at home. He smokes a lot of pot so he would just come home and sleep even if he had the kids. I\u2019m seriously freaking out about her being there with him alone. \n\nThe way I\u2019ve been treated by him for leaving has been awful. It\u2019s a constant back and forth of I miss you so much to how could you do this, look at how bad it\u2019s effecting you and I\u2019m doing so good. He\u2019ll text me about whatever new thing he bought today and withhold child support bc \u201cI won\u2019t let him see her\u201d but then won\u2019t show for visits and make it my fault bc I brought a friend with us or didn\u2019t make the time clear or whatever the excuse, they\u2019re always untrue or irrelevant. So the abuse has just gotten worse. Threats have gotten worse. My anxiety is so bad, I cannot sleep at all. I only reply to him really when I have to and have been not reading his texts hardly at all but just the obsession with what he thinks about me gets to me so badly and he knows it so he says things that make me feel less than and it just begins this cycle of less than/anxiety/tears/trying to man up for my kids/collapsing into bed/staring at ceiling all night even though my body is so exhausted. Can anyone tell me when this will end? Will I stop loving him? When will I stop caring? Any tips on things to help? I feel like I\u2019m just dying over here and he\u2019s over there living this amazing life. I start back to school in January and I know that will help a lot but the thought of feeling like this another 2 months makes me want to die!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I ruin everything because I can\u2019t get out of this cycle and whenever something happens I get upset over what the Nex and his supply do to piss me off. About a couple months ago, my boyfriend and I moved in together. I really thought it would have brought us closer but what ended up happening was he became more aggressive and angry over everything and he blames me. He tells his therapist that I\u2019m the center of all of his problems.  His therapist tells him I\u2019m projecting and that I do the whole transparent thing. More Han anything I wanna get away from everything that has to do with the Nex. It\u2019s been years. I have kids with him and the more I try to get away the more he finds a way in. It is controlling my life and the only way i feel like I can make everyone happy is if I\u2019m not here. I\u2019m just too scared to kill myself because for one I don\u2019t wanna leave my kids alone, I\u2019d miss them so much, I also am against suicide because of my religion so I feel stuck. I have ruined too many peoples lives. My kids, my poor fucking kids didn\u2019t ask for any of this. I don\u2019t even know where to go right now. I don\u2019t have a job or money or transportation. I am literally like my boyfriend and the Nex and supply say, a waste of space on this earth. Yesterday my boyfriend called me a pile of dog Shit for the first time. Every time i get mad about what\u2019s going on he yells at me and tells me to shit up whenever i open my mouth. he also tells me I\u2019m acting like the victim when I\u2019m not. I share things on my Instagram about narcissistic abuse and things I can relate to and it bothers him because he says everything got messed up cause of me. I can\u2019t even fucking cry in front of him before he mocks me for crying. He\u2019s gotten to the point where he justifies his aggressive behavior because of me. It\u2019s basically all of my fault according to him. I know I\u2019m to blame but it\u2019s not all my fault. He says that this relationship is need because of me. Every other day I get upset over something the Nex did. I can\u2019t help it. I wish it didn\u2019t bother me as much as it does. I wanna be free of him. I just want everyone to be happy. My boyfriend said I\u2019m not his problem anymore. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I feel like a fucking robot. I wanna kill mused so bad. So bad. I really do. I\u2019m tired.

Tbh I\u2019m not sure if this is the only thing that fucked me up, but it made a HUGE impact on how I see myself. when I was going through it I remember this specific very low feeling like this feeling like I\u2019m not enough for anything and I\u2019m so worthless that I shouldn\u2019t try to make myself happy or bother trying at all because I don\u2019t deserve it. the first couple years after remembering again when I was 22 was the most painful time, and I guess it\u2019s more or less eased up and I have come to terms with things, while I still feel really shitty around my dad, I can act fairly normal now. I\u2019m also living away from home, and he\u2019s paying for school, which is great. I still can\u2019t escape the worthless feelings. I was recently diagnosed with bipolar, and I\u2019m on medication that actually works and makes me less anxious and depressed than I\u2019ve ever felt in my whole life, but the self hatred and worthlessness and feeling unlovable are always with me. I\u2019m just really isolated and I can\u2019t make friends, I\u2019ve lost most of them through my bipolar episodes before my diagnosis, and yeah I probably deserve it. I can\u2019t feel comfortable with other people because I always feel like I\u2019m not good enough, and the way I\u2019ve interacted with people has always left me alone and feeling worthless. It seems like I seek outside approval from people for some reason, while being terrified that I\u2019m not enough or interesting or worth it.  Maybe it has to do with the abuse, but in any case I have no idea how to approve myself and love myself, besides dealing with isolation. Right now I\u2019m desperately trying to lose weight, I\u2019ve been on a diet since May, and the only way I feel ok, is to not eat and work out at all possible times, but for the most part I still eat enough, I\u2019m just obsessive about it. But I know that\u2019s another big symptom of not liking myself and wanting validation from my appearance. I just feel really alone in it, because there\u2019s no one I can talk to or eat lunch with, and I feel like there\u2019s no way for me to meet my own needs without actively self sabotaging and hurting myself emotionally and physically to match the \u201clove\u201d I was given as a teen. I just don\u2019t know how to get out of this cycle or if I ever will, but life feels like it\u2019s not possible to stop. I just wanted to see if anyone has any insights on this step of the way? I know It\u2019s always been really rough, and grief does come in stages, and Ive felt a lot of it already. I know that I won\u2019t be able to have friends or a relationship, or any real trust in life, and I\u2019m already 25. It\u2019s just heart breaking having to keep myself down for no reason and treating myself so badly just to feel ok, which makes no fucking sense.

He gaslit me anytime I vocalized discomfort in his behavior or felt upset by something he did. He used any opportunity to break down my self esteem to raise his own. He\u2019d use me to manage his own insecurities by putting all the blame for them on me and guilting me for things so he didn\u2019t have to take responsibility for his own feelings or actions. All of that has added up to a hurt that has been hard to manage, but I\u2019ve been managing it well since we broke up. One of the biggest ways for me to cope with that has been my job that I love. Distracting myself with it has been one of the best tools I\u2019ve had in managing the realization of all of this abuse I put up with for 3 years.\n\nNow about 5 months later he got hired to work in the office on my school campus that I work in. My boss knew we had broken up a while back but didn\u2019t know the intricacies of it because I wanted to keep that apart because it\u2019s what felt the most professional. I talked to her she told me and I explained why it freaked me out. We had a meeting together with an HR person to figure it out and I felt like I would be able to manage with him working there. But then for pretty much the past week now I\u2019ve been having panic attacks everyday when I leave campus from work or even the days I have classes. I keep seeing him and there\u2019s a big sign in my office welcoming him back. I know the people in my office love him and he now has a higher position than me.\n\nOn top of it, my last experience with him was fairly recently. I went to talk to him in a Starbucks for both of us to make peace about everything. It ended with him screaming at me and slamming the table to embarrass me in public for dating someone new, despite the fact he broke up with me. He\u2019s always struggled for this sense of control over me, and him finding out I wasn\u2019t sad about him anymore and moved on made him furious. He told mutual friends terrible and untrue things about me and slowly I noticed more people blocking or unfriending me because of it.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to bring this up to my boss again. I need the job and I can\u2019t quit, but I can\u2019t live with this constant stress.

I try to talk to him and eventually he\u2019ll open up and tell me allll the things that go on at his fathers home. For the sake of a small back story, I wasn\u2019t with my sons dad for long before I got pregnant. My son was completely planned. But I was young and I was sure this was who I was going to spend my life with. But he was a very aggressive individual. There was very minimal physical abuse. Most pushing and once he grabbed a fist full of my hair to shove my face into the car window. All because some guy at Buffalo Wild Wings checked me out. The worst of the physical aspect was when he pushed me into a mirrored armoire and a piece of the mirror literally stabbed me in the ribs. I panicked as did he, but he refused to take me to the ER. No records=it didn\u2019t happen. He still emotionally abuses me now, the only difference is I have his first born son, and he has a partner to tag team on me. \n\nIn 2013, he and I came to an agreement, we would be as civil as possible for my son. He genuinely wants what\u2019s best for my son blah blah. I was working a lot. Once I realized that he wasn\u2019t going to be financially responsible, I worked my ass off. To this day, I\u2019m still working hard. In February 2019, child support wanted to review our case. It was opened in 2011 and never reviewed. It became absolute chaos. He started sending me long threatening texts saying if I went through with the review he\u2019d take my son from me. Calling me a money hungry bitch and worse...a horrible mother. I\u2019ll admit I worked a lot from 2015-2018 but I still did everything I could for my son. All his projects, hand painting anti-bullying/breast cancer awareness shirts for school, it was all me. All while making sure my son knew he was loved and I worked hard to make sure he had everything he needed, and THEN he could have things he wanted. I raise my son to understand the value of everything. Mostly, time spent. We go on our adventures and we have a great time. I bought him a telescope so we go out at night and look at the moon and admire the beautiful night sky in rural Texas. \n\nThat still never stops the tag team from calling me every name in the book. I\u2019m genuinely afraid of being alone with him, so when the court date came up, I lawyered up. He had me so convinced that he would make the judge take my son from me that I actually got a lawyer. He\u2019s manipulative and now he\u2019s passing that abuse to my son. The last weekend that he picked up my son, he yelled at him because he said his stepbrother is his step brother. He actually got in trouble for that. And forced to go outside and pick up trash. Texas heat is no joke. And my son is telling me that his dad sends him outside to pick up trash as punishment. While his dad stays inside and watches football all weekend. Once my son had this odd peeling of his hands and feet. The dr said he needed to take a break from any water based activities. My baby just told me last night that his dad ignored mine and the drs direction and took him swimming the next day. Then his dad told him \u201cthat\u2019s not a lie\u201d. I feel like I always have to undo what his dad has done. What his dad has put into his head. But at the same time, I don\u2019t know where to start because his dad knows how to get in my head. I was in college just a few months ago, full time, I wasn\u2019t working, I relied on financial aid. But he convinced me that because I wasn\u2019t working, he could take my son. I dropped out of college and I\u2019m working full time again. 12 hour days and nights. All because I think I haven\u2019t recovered from the abuse he put me through and still puts me through. I don\u2019t know where to start undoing the toxicity he put in my head. And I feel like I\u2019m aimlessly trying to take out the negativity he\u2019s fed my son without an end in sight. \n\nI\u2019ve been abused all my life. But I\u2019m trying to break the cycle and give my son a better life. One without him questioning his self worth, or if he\u2019s truly loved. I feel like a terrible mother sometimes, because I feel like I have not the slightest idea how to fix what\u2019s broken or even where to start.

This one hit home with me. \n\nAbuse has no cut-off date. The sounds, the voices, the smells, the sensations reverberate long after the episode has ended \u2013 both in nightmares and in waking moments. The victim's ability to trust other people \u2013 i.e., to assume that their motives are at least rational, if not necessarily benign \u2013 has been irrevocably undermined. Social institutions \u2013 even the family itself \u2013 are perceived as precariously poised on the verge of an ominous, Kafkaesque mutation. Nothing is either safe or credible anymore. \n\nVictims typically react by undulating between emotional numbing and increased arousal: insomnia, irritability, restlessness, and attention deficits. Recollections of the traumatic events intrude in the form of dreams, night terrors, flashbacks, and distressing associations.\n\nThe abused develop compulsive rituals to fend off obsessive thoughts. Other psychological sequelae reported include cognitive impairment, reduced capacity to learn, memory disorders, sexual dysfunction, social withdrawal, inability to maintain long-term relationships, or even mere intimacy, phobias, ideas of reference and superstitions, delusions, hallucinations, psychotic microepisodes, and emotional flatness. Depression and anxiety are very common. These are forms and manifestations of self-directed aggression. The sufferer rages at his own victimhood and resulting multiple dysfunctions.\n\nHe feels shamed by his new disabilities and responsible, or even guilty, somehow, for his predicament and the dire consequences borne by his nearest and dearest. His sense of self-worth and self-esteem are crippled. Suicide is perceived as both a relief and a solution.\n\nIn a nutshell, abuse victims suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Their strong feelings of anxiety, guilt, and shame are also typical of victims of childhood abuse, domestic violence, and rape. They feel anxious because the perpetrator's behavior is seemingly arbitrary and unpredictable \u2013 or mechanically and inhumanly regular.\n\nThey feel guilty and disgraced because, to restore a semblance of order to their shattered world and a modicum of dominion over their chaotic life, they need to transform themselves into the cause of their own degradation and the accomplices of their tormentors.\n\nInevitably, in the aftermath of abuse, victims feel helpless and powerless. This loss of control over one's life and body is manifested physically in impotence, attention deficits, and insomnia. This is often exacerbated by the disbelief many abuse victims encounter, especially if they are unable to produce scars, or other \"objective\" proof of their ordeal. Language cannot communicate such an intensely private experience as pain.\n\nBystanders resent the abused because they make them feel guilty and ashamed for having done nothing to prevent the atrocity. The victims threaten their sense of security and their much-needed belief in predictability, justice, and rule of law. The victims, on their part, do not believe that it is possible to effectively communicate to \"outsiders\" what they have been through. The abuse seems to have occurred on \"another galaxy.\" This is how Auschwitz was described by the author K. Zetnik in his testimony in the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem in 1961.\n\nOften, continued attempts to repress fearful memories result in psychosomatic illnesses (conversion). The victim wishes to forget the abuse, to avoid re-experiencing the often life-threatening torment and to shield his human environment from the horrors. In conjunction with the victim's pervasive distrust, this is frequently interpreted as hypervigilance, or even paranoia. It seems that the victims can't win. Abuse is forever.\n\nWhen the victim realizes that the abuse he suffered is now an integral part of his very being, a determinant of his self-identity, and that he is doomed to bear his pains and fears, shackled to his trauma, and tortured by it \u2013 suicide often appears to be a benign alternative. -Sam Vaknin", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The way it ended this time was just particularly interesting. She discarded me, because I caught her with yet another guy in her phone (with whom nothing was happening, of course) and she flipped out...insisted this was the last straw. I moved out of the house but she of course hoovered me back. We continued being intimate for 6 weeks afterwards but she clearly wanted me at arm's length.\n\n I finally trusted my instincts this time and knowing I was just one supply of many at this point, I told her who she was...that the rules to her game are that unless I catch her red handed that she will NEVER.ADMIT.TO.ANYTHING. Told her that she has NPD (since the \"therapists\" that she sees will never be privy to her true nature, because she lies to them and pretends to be normal, preventing any honest diagnoses). I understand telling her this was probably a mistake but I couldn't help myself. The last time I saw her, I made this crystal clear. Told her how I know she saw several people she swore she never did (which both proved to be true after some research, one particularly in a HUGE way, as you will read below...they both later told me honestly after I simply asked and explained how I was with her the whole time). She literally tried to push me down the stairs and the last words I ever heard out of her mouth were \"I hope you drop dead.\" I honestly don't think she ever thought I would be able to leave her.\n\nAnyway, there was someone she cheated on me with in the past (of course he was not the only one), and I always knew she had seen him but she would always deny everything adamantly, like the professional she is. Well one day last year I looked through an empty backpack of hers and found a super detailed 2 page love letter to said person that detailed oh so many juicy things. She had no choice but to confess, but swore up and down that they only saw each other once.\n\nI had searched for this person on Facebook with no luck for quite a while but finally found him 2 weeks ago. I Just let him know I was with her for many years and we never separated, lived together for the past 5. He told me she told him that her and I were broken up the whole 2 years they saw each other (he moved away two years ago) behind my back and that they NEVER used protection. She always went to his place (his mother's house of course, he was ten+ years younger than my Nex) and was never invited to our house.\n\nHe texted her and confronted her on the lies she expected us both to believe, and of course she was hoping we would never find out about each other but now the cat's out of the bag. She denied everything to him and called me a total psycho that couldn't handle a breakup (even though we only broke up briefly a few times when I caught her cheating and took her back like a moron...one time I even saved her from suicide, that's how she got me back the first time). \n\nI gave him all the proof he needed with a bunch of screenshots that proved she was totally full of it and he believed me so he sent me a bunch of screenshots as well that further proved her insanity. Not long after she was really exposed she sent me a series of threatening texts and emails. Basically said she hopes I drop dead and that she has plenty of friends that want to break my face and damage my car...she even texted this guy that she was immediately coming over to smash my windshield and he quickly sent me a screenshot to warn me. He knows she is a crazy narc now too.\n\nShe is obviously freaking out about being exposed for what she truly is and is doing her best to smear me and play the victim. This is especially since they were former co-workers who would have sex at work and and she still works there. Of course everyone thinks she is an angel with morals and a good person (if they only knew). I'm not going to go out of my way to go on my own anti-smear \"truth campaign\" against her, but you can be sure that she's damn sure terrified that I might. It's enough for me to know what she did and that I should stay away forever, unless someone (perhaps a former mutual acquaintance) wants to ask about what she did, then I will probably tell. Just so the truth can shine, I suppose.\n\nThis was honestly not an attempt to hurt her but I just wanted personal closure because I knew she was always lying...I didn't tell this guy to message her at all, I just wanted to get some closure for what I already knew. Unfortunately for me it turned out to be even worse than I thought. He knows she is crazy now and even said he feels empathy for what I must be going through since he knew we were together for a long time before they were ever a thing (which she would have lied to me about forever, even if we got married...THANK GOD WE DIDN'T).\n\nRight after I started no contact, I had called her sister who is a mental health professional and told her although I didn't want to be with her sister anymore that I know she has NPD and to please help her, for her own good. She responded by saying \"it's a hard thing to treat, especially if the person doesn't want to acknowledge it and I have my own issues with her myself. If you ever need to talk I will be available since I've known you for so long and I can separate your situation from hers.\" I told her this won't be necessary but to please help her and I hung up.\n\nWell after these crazy threats I texted my Nex's sister about a week ago honestly conveying that I didn't plan on contacting her ever again, but I wanted her to be aware of the details of this situation and the crazy threats that were being thrown at me...also that I'm lucky I don't have a disease. I made it clear that I don't want to talk to her sister ever again and will never again be in the picture, but that I loved her sister very much at one time and I wish that things could have turned out differently. I also once again asked her to get her help...she never responded, and of course there is a chance she may have blocked me. \n\nAnyhow, I understand that this may have broken no contact, but I have not received anymore threats or communication from my Nex. I went through months of hell, but I'm now coming to a point of genuine sadness about everything and I almost feel sorry for my Nex. Sad for myself as well that I fell in love with a mask that slowly melted away before my very eyes, and enjoyed hurting me so much secretly with deceptive lies. Unfortunately though, this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHowever, there's no greater tip than to never take these people back in the first place.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Abuse can happen anywhere and isn't locked in to any particular gender.  \n\n\nFor 12 years I was married to a woman whom I truly loved. We had two children together. It took my 12 years, her infidelity, the death of my Dad and finally my divorce to truly come to terms with the reality that I had been sharing my life with someone who was never going to have my best interests at heart.   \nSomething I hope everyone understands out there, who have questions or doubts about their relationship, Depression/Anxiety is NOT feasible excuse for manipulation, gas lighting and emotional abuse. For that matter, it isn't a feasible excuse for ANY type of abuse. It is a slap in the face to the people out there who struggle with depression or anxiety, there are plenty of people out there who struggle with depression and anxiety who are the most giving, selfless, empathetic people you could ever meet. I know some of them and they are amazing people. My ex-wife hid behind her \"depression,\" she used it like a loaded magazine, always firing guilt trips at me. For a long time she really had me going. I had neglected the emotional health of my kids, my own emotional health and had lost touch with many friends and family for her sake. I was stuck in a vicious cycle of co-dependency and I truly believed I \"had to do it for her\" because of her \"depression.\" I was bombarded with guilt trips and suicide threats for wanting her to just stop treating me horribly. Never did she apologize or change her behavior, she would just turn inward and self-loathe, make me apologize for even asking. Late in our marriage, I began to see with clear eyes some of these things about her. I began to dig my heels in and resist her treatment. The marriage went south quickly after that. I couldn't be used anymore...so she checked out of the relationship almost entirely and even cheated.   \n\n\nPeople should not make excuses for abuse. However, if you are the one being abused and mistreated, be sure that you also don't make excuses for them. It's okay to care about yourself and it is NOT too much to ask that your spouse show you basic, healthy care and regard in the relationship. If you see the signs and you think this is you...talk to someone. Don't stay stuck in a toxic relationship. You WILL be happier without them, I promise you.

Class and yesterday we were talking about dating and relationships so I knew that we were going to learn about abuse soon. Well we learned about emotional abuse today, alongside gaslighting and abuse with similar elements.\n\nI was in an emotionally abusive relationship in the 6th and 7th grade, so when I was 11-13, and that was quite a few years ago. I\u2019m still in therapy because of what my \u201cbest friend\u201d did to me in those years. So learning about the red flags of emotional abuse brought back a lot of memories I didn\u2019t want to remember, it even brought back some memories I haven\u2019t thought about in a long time because I suppressed them into the back of my mind.\n\nI was really thinking about excusing myself to go to the restroom or even pull one of the teachers aside, because even though I didn\u2019t full-on cry I still looked like a mess and I thought it would be awkward to enter my 2nd block class looking like I was on the edge of tears. I ended up not doing either because I didn\u2019t want to make a scene or anything.\n\nEventually one of my friends who sat in front of me turned around to talk to me before class ended and saw my ugly near-tears face and asked if I was really affected by the lesson and I just nodded. It took him a little while to realize that I wasn\u2019t crying because the subject was depressing, but because I had lived through it before. He managed to make me laugh because he\u2019s my absolute clown friend so I didn\u2019t go to my next class as a wreck.\n\nBut when I got home I started thinking about it again and started talking to myself about it (talking to myself helps me organize my thoughts okay-), I actually cried only a few hours ago. Fuck emotional abusers, I just want to get through health class and get on with my life, but thanks to experience, it will now be a emotional roller coaster for me.\n\nThis is my first post here so I\u2019m sorry if this whole thing is subpar to what everyone is posting on this subreddit.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

My Psychologist who I have seen since I was 14 (I am 25 now) seem conviced that my ex friend was a narcissist, even tho his behaviour in some ways was not what you would call typical of a narcissist.   \n\n\nIt was really weird, it was like he had narcissistic and normal personalities fighting within him. Like don't get my wrong he hurt me and I know I am 100% better without him in my life but I also from a psychological standpoint find him incredibly confusing. He stood by me during a really bad time in my life and he did it in a way that actually seemed selfless, but then in arguments he would 100% never ever take responsibility and just straight up lie about what happened to get out of situations. He also at times attempted to gas light me but also at the same time there were times where he genuinely tried to empower me to become a stronger person. As out relationship progressed slowly the more narcissistic traits he began to display, however it wasn't like their was a mask peeling back, it was like I was actually watching him slowly transform into one before my eyes. My Psychologist put it really well in that it wasn't like I was just some plaything for him like a typical narrcisst, he actually did care about me, but he also couldn't stop himself from hurting me. But part of this also could have been the fact that we literally only had our first disagreement 3 years into our friendship, as we had gotten along so well up to that point, so maybe it was in him all along.  \n\n\nAlso interestingly he never once hinted that he thought he was somehow superior to everyone, or special. And he had incredibly poor social skills when it came to women, I tried to get him to get out of his shell, which worked to an extent but like he was very introverted, and at times seemed to kinda hate himself and was very nihilistic. But nearing then end of our friendship he started to get out of that mindset and I was happy for him, but like he actually became a bit of a dick and I guess started to seem more typical of an over narcissist he would just constantly ignore me, it was like I had served my purpose of making him feel better and he was moving on.

That is a lie.

{"post_id": "dj8ov3", "created_utc": 1571329215, "title": "ready for divorce", "author": "thr0waways2019", "self_text": "I F(29) have been married for 4 years and together for almost 10 with my husband M(33). Over the last 6 months with the help of 2 therapists/friends, I have come to the conclusion that I believe my husband is emotionally/verbally abusive and that it is in our son's (4) best interest to separate. When we got pregnant, which was a surprise, I had confided to him that my parents nasty divorce really hurt me and was hard to deal with my own parents fighting around me constantly. They brought me into their arguments, and even after they divorced, I would get interrogated about what was happening at the other parents house, or what was said on the phone. I have PTSD-C from my childhood and deal with it as best I can, by being honest about my feelings and addressing things head on (hence why I told him about this). I asked him that we never fight in front of the child, because it's not healthy for anyone and I have personal experience that I don't care to re-live. This was not as much of an issue when he was a small baby because I did everything possible not to argue with him as I was simply exhausted from taking care of a newborn. As time went on, I have had to have the same conversation with him numerous times because he will goad me into an argument and then call me crazy and blame me for getting upset because 'all you do is go cry in the fucking corner', things like that. I have tried several things, such as asking that we just 'postpone' the conversation until after the kid goes to bed. Begged for him to get therapy, tried only arguing over text so we chose our words more carefully, nothing has worked. The few times that he actually did 'put the argument down' he refused to pick it up later and talk about the issue, or he would just wait for me to be reading a book to our son and would just go to bed himself, or get locked into his video games with headset on. This just happened last night, as I'd sent him a text during the day asking to have a serious conversation last night about our finances and when I came out from putting our son to bed he was already in bed himself. at 8:30pm. We wake up at 5:30.   \n\n\nANYWAY there is a lot of back story but this was the last straw. We were in an argumentative state all day about finances. When we got home, admittedly, I made a comment about feeling like his mommy and not wanting to do it anymore, not wanting to do any of this anymore. He got extremely mean and made a comment about 'oh so you're back to killing yourself now huh' and I responded that no, I was actually thinking that we may be better off not being married anymore. This made him rage. he laughed a maniacal laugh and said 'HAHAHA fucking do it I dare you, go file for divorce' with lots of colorful language and name calling. We live in a very small house, and our son was within ear shot but playing and not paying much attention at this point. He then started bringing my 4 year old into it saying \"you hear that sonsname your mommy is going to take you away from me and never let you see me again\" \"daddy is a bad daddy and mommy hates me so she will take you away from me\" this went on for another 10 minutes of him bringing son into it and me begging him to stop and leave son out of it. he would say \"what he needs to know the truth so he isn't blindsided when he never sees me again\" It ended with my son screaming 'guys stop being mean guys, stop yelling daddy' and being clearly scared or upset. I admittedly was yelling at this point for husband to leave him out of it, which in hindsight was no better. He walked outside and when I tried to follow (so that none of this would be in earshot of the kid) he pushed me back through the doorway and then tried to say that he didn't do it and im making it up. It was at this point that I grabbed my kid and took him to the park so everyone could cool down and he didn't get exposed to more shit. When we got into the car my son asked me why daddy was being so mean and I didn't even know what to say. I just told him that he was having a bad day and tried to change the subject to the park. It was then that my son broke my heart, saying \"mama I have a pack of wolves outside the car protectin you\" and I felt just like a powerless little kid again. When we returned home I insisted that husband go in to apologize to him which he reluctantly did. Our son has now brought that event up 2 subsequent times, mostly because he wanted to go to the park again, but the way he brings it up is to ask me if I remember when daddy was being mean and when we went to the park where there were no mean daddies. I swear I have never badmouthed his dad in front of him and have tried to shield him from this stuff as much as I can, but apparently he sees it for what it is. \n\n  \nI told a friend about this who was pretty shocked and immediately told me that it is something called emotional abuse. This is the second time in recent months that someone has told me I am being emotionally/verbally abused and manipulated and I guess I am now coming to the realization of why I have felt so badly for so long. I don't really know what the point of this post is, I guess I just needed to get it out. I am haunted by the look on my kids face that night, and by his little voice talking about it over a week later. I just feel so completely done.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

It\u2019s been a really rough week and all of these things are coming back full force right now. \n\nI was on and off again with someone for about 8 years. In the past he had been a little clingy and jealous but this time things slowly started to change in a way they never had before.  He would ask me about every detail of my day and get upset if I accidentally left something out. He would blow up my phone with tons of texts/calls while I was at work, asleep or doing something that made me unable to get to my phone. He claimed It was because I was ignoring him. He started telling me what I was and was not allowed to do, and who I was and was not allowed to be friends with. He made me take pictures and send them to him so he could verify where I was. He wanted total access to my phone and location, he even tried to download one of those spy apps to read my texts. I had to ask permission to do things like take a nap, shower, or visit my family so he wouldn\u2019t get mad wondering where I was. He constantly accused me of cheating on him with people I hardly knew, including his brother and someone in my own family. He started showing up to my job (I worked at a restaurant) and sneaking into the dining room to \u201ckeep an eye on me\u201d. He would then \u201cescort\u201d me home. My coworkers noticed and told me they were worried about me. \n\nI tried to talk to some of our mutual friends about the way he was treating me to get some support from them. He freaked out and told me to stop because \u201cthat\u2019s our personal business and it\u2019s inappropriate to be telling everyone about it\u201d So I kept everything to myself. I frequently tried talking him about all this like adults (we\u2019re both in our mid 20\u2019s) but it would just start a fight where he would claim that I \u201cmust not love him enough\u201d.\n\nWe were in the process of moving in together and I was terrified. I truly loved him but I was worried this behavior would continue, if not get even worse. He had already moved in but I was stalling and pushing back the date I was moving in hoping he would realize he was hurting me and try to fix things. He didn\u2019t. Instead he ran back to everyone that he told me I wasn\u2019t allowed to talk to and complained to them about me. I got nasty/hateful messages from people I thought were my friends and his family saying that I was a terrible person for what I was doing to him, that it wasn\u2019t fair to him, and that he could do better than me if this is how I was going to treat him. I tried to explain that it was because I was uncomfortable with his behavior and I was just given the response \u201che does those things because he loves you SO MUCH\u201d. I felt like no one was listening to me. \n\nOne day when we were at home he gave me this note he wrote and got down on his knee and asked me to marry him. He said there was no one else he ever wanted to be with, and I agreed. A few weeks later I came home without letting him know and walked in on him in bed with another girl. He just shrugged and said \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d &amp; told me I needed to move out immediately so she could move in. I was devastated. I thought at that point someone would realize what he had done and be there for me. But instead everyone continued to side with him and treat me like I deserved this. I had people tell me to my face that I was lying about the way he treated me. He had completely alienated me from everyone. He told me this is what I get for not listening and that I only had myself to blame. He repeatedly called the police on me and harassed me for several weeks after the break up until I blocked him in every way I could. I deleted all my social media. But he continued trying to contact me. My family wanted me to get a restraining order and I honestly don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t... People continued to support his actions. \n\nIt got so bad that I felt I couldn\u2019t trust anyone at all. The story of what happened between us kept spreading and pretty soon I didn\u2019t even feel welcome living in the same town anymore. It seemed like everyone there hated me.  So I packed my things and moved several hours away. I didn\u2019t want anyone to find me. I felt like I just had to leave everything behind. It\u2019s been over two years and I\u2019ve never been back to my hometown and have never spoken to anyone there since. No one has ever tried to reach out to me.\n\nI was hoping by this point in time I would have at least started to heal but I haven\u2019t at all. I\u2019ve been in and out of therapy, on medications, tried to distract myself with new hobbies and things to do. I\u2019ve struggled to make any new friends and was at one point working 7 days a week just to keep myself busy. I often still have nightmares about him so bad I can\u2019t sleep. I feel like I\u2019m constantly living in fear &amp; guilt for things I didn\u2019t do. He has me convinced that I can\u2019t be happy without him. There\u2019s days where i get so angry at myself for not keeping my mouth shut and just letting him have his way. Then maybe this wouldn\u2019t have happened. Sometimes I believe I really was the problem. I miss him so much and I know it\u2019s wrong. I know I shouldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nHas anyone else been through a similar experience? How did you start your life over after going through something like this? Were you able to move on and have new friends/relationships easily or did it take you a while? Did you have trouble trusting people for a long time? Were you ever paranoid that he would find you?\n\nI appreciate any responses. It\u2019s been such a rough week sometimes it gets really hard to keep thinking things will get better. \n\nTL;DR: my emotionally abusive boyfriend alienated me from everyone I knew and trusted to the point where when we broke up I had to move somewhere new to get away from him and start completely over.

That I was in the wrong for staying friends with my ex. That I spend too much money on trips (I went on one trip and that\u2019s what he was mad about and what started our argument last week). I went to NY for the first time just with a few of my girlfriends and I texted him constantly and sent him pictures which pretty much made me not be able to enjoy my time. He went on to say he\u2019s only spent $800 this year and just on his bike. That he wouldn\u2019t have spent all the money he did this year on food or doing things with me if we weren\u2019t together. He told me he\u2019s given me money, so why would that make him controlling. He would give me money and than make snide remarks or use it against me later. He was very controlling and didn\u2019t want me doing anything without him (ex. My trip with friends). He then mentioned all that he\u2019s done for me, from waking up to make me breakfast before work, buying me flowers and donuts during my period. Then said what have I ever done for him. Well, I did a lot and gave him all my love, but that wasn\u2019t enough. \n\nBasically he smeared me and tried to sound loving in the same email. His best friend was obviously able to read this all. His tone in the email was way different then how he spoke to me on the phone. Also, everything that he said is wrong about me, could actually be fixed. Him being physically abusive and verbally abusive to me isn\u2019t. \n\nBut nevertheless, he\u2019s made me feel like it\u2019s all my fault and I\u2019m the reason things ended or didn\u2019t work out and that he would have done anything to make it work. \n\nI feel like complete shit today and I\u2019m assuming that was his motive.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When his parents got divorced, his mother ended up switching between using him as a personal counselor and practically forgetting he existed\n2. He had to practically raise both of his sisters, and his older sister has a whole slew of mental issues that I don't know all of\n3. His mother also made him act like an adult all the time and forced him to do things that she should have been able to do, like when he was 13 she had him write her essay to apply for a Phd or something like that\n4. His mother made his father out to be a horrible monster and tried to get him to hate his father\n5. Despite that, his father's house was the only place that he could be himself, but he only got to go once a week and most of the time his stepmother was there\n6. His stepmother pretended like he was stupid and hated him\n7. Not part of the abuse, but his father also died really young, leaving him with just his mother\n\nAs a result of all these things, he can be pretty distant at times and never lets anyone help him with anything, as well as the fact that apparently all these factors combined or he had some previous condition that made it so he has distinct conversations with himself. I have no idea what it is, so I'm not going to try to diagnose him, but a conversation from a few days ago went something like this, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"I can't f\\_cking do this, holy f\\_cking sh\\_t what am I doing?

My (alleged) Narc ex was an initial long distance relationship. I moved across country for him. After months of seeing that he was emotionally, verbally, financially and hedging on physically abusive, I left after six months. He yelled at me to do more dishes after a sixty hour work week. He called me a bitch over a $1.50. He never supported my artistic endeavors or attempt to make a life in another state because it took time away from his interests. He let his friend slap my ass and laughed when he saw it made me uncomfortable and told me to stop being so \u201cbutthurt\u201d. So many examples. Even crueler language I won\u2019t take up too much space explaining, I\u2019m sure you all know. I spent a lot of time on emotional eggshells. Breezed past certain interactions that disgusted me. Ignored flags. Took the high road on lots of things, buried others. We had an exciting life and I was down for the ride and deeply in love, probably still am. After enough bullshit, my soul just started speaking so loud I couldn\u2019t ignore it anymore. This wasn\u2019t healthy, it was holding me back, this isn\u2019t a partner. \n\nUpon leaving, the turmoil begins. He is dying inside and needs me. Sees the error of his ways. Would do anything and everything to make this work and be a better man for me. This is his life\u2019s mission. \n\nHe moved here to make things work. \nTwo weeks later, he put his hands on me ( and his mother) for the first time after getting blackout. This was about two months ago and it\u2019s been hell ever since. A constant block unblock, push/ pull. \n\nI tried no contact for five days. \nHe emailed, called my work phone, showed up at my house multiple times. \n\nMany times I would cave and let him in. Indulge in toxic sex and regret it later as it only got me deeper in. Last week I called the cops for the first time after he showed up while we were texting during a weak moment when I admitted I missed him. \n\nHe is desperate. I am apparently his end all be all, can\u2019t live without me believes we are destined in the starts and it\u2019s only a matter of time. His life is supposedly in shambles. He can\u2019t live with himself (apparently) and has started making suicidal statements. Also saying things like \u2018I can\u2019t leave you alone,\u2019 \u2018I won\u2019t leave you alone\u2019, \u2018I\u2019d be better off in jail.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s gotten fucking crazy and I am trying so hard to just fucking stop. Sometimes I do well. Sometimes I start to miss him. It\u2019s true, I\u2019ve never loved anyone so much. But I\u2019ve never hated anyone so much either. I am unrecognizable when we argue. I am a monster when he triggers me anymore, fighting back as hard as I\u2019ve been hurt. \n\nI do well most of the time honestly, but I feel vulnerable. I sometimes find myself wanting out life back. Because of course, the good parts are always so good. Sometimes I wonder if this time he is serious and is really prepared to be a partner to me. Even if he is, how could I possibly start to give him any part of myself ever again. Sometimes I\u2019m a constant stream of opposing thought. \n\nAll I know is how many times I\u2019ve known that this person isn\u2019t good for me, and I\u2019m hoping to just power through the times when I miss it. But damn, it\u2019s hard when that person is ten minutes up the road begging for you to come be pampered.... for five minutes.

Had a great time and hear his life story about how he lost his husband to cancer (true) and had a daughter. Heard about how he was traumatized and abused as a child. His whole sob story come out after liquor. \n1st incident - next morning at a restaurant for breakfast, he was asking me to see the pictures from the night prior. I reviewed them and thought we looks drunk and didn\u2019t want them posted on fb. End with him yelling at me in public about why he doesn\u2019t understand why I can send them to him. \n\nI get up, walk away and head home without entertaining him. Not before I told him \u201cI\u2019m not the one you\u2019re going to talk like that to\u201d and left. He called hours later to apologize. \n\nFrom there on after we got together and I was bombarded with gifts. Ferragamo shoes, Varvatos clothes, 1900 diamond ring, $3k watch etc. fights happened regarding gifts because I felt he was buying me. Then at some point his mom told me to stop arguing with him about it because that\u2019s who he is and how he works. Just let him. So I complied. Then he started do the same thing to my friends. Chanel sunglasses for my best friend, brand new iPhone X for my other friends and he only met each once. I started seeing his insecurities immediately. Another argument and supposedly I was in the wrong again. Then I started noticing how he bad mouthed everyone in his life. Best friends, friends, mom and sister. I learned quickly how he was. In between this time, I had broken up with him 5 times and each time, he would go after my friends. Trying to malign me to them, harassing them with text messages, face book messages and then went to social media to slander my name. I was everything from a meth addict, rapist, and a whore. Only way to placate him was to get back together each time. Was a toxic cycle, but it spared my friends. My name is destroyed and I lived in the social scene. I knew everyone from the housewives of franchise, to running in the charity scene and the bar scene. The events/ invites of the summer we nonexistent, but it was a real lesson. Now, it\u2019s been 9 months since I escaped him. I planned a move and he wanted to move too. We had never lived together at this point, but I was required to come over to his place daily as he didn\u2019t want me alone at my place. I had it all worked out...since I didn\u2019t have the support of friends in my city anymore, I figured out a way to escape him. I was moving to a city that used to be my playground from years prior. Long story short, during Christmas I packed up a majority of my belongings. The only thing I couldnt take was my furniture which was a sacrifice without him knowing my plan. He was gone to Visit his family for Xmas  and I had moved my expensive and personal belongings. So when he came back and we had a blow up, he told me to get the hell out of his house and I complied. My friend knew the plan and allowed me to stay with him. This being a friend he knew nothing about or their existence years before. This was a scene right out of Enough. Rewind to November when I tried to leave him and ended up with me getting punched in the face, kicked in the chest and nails dig into my wrist. This is a long story and skipping through a lot of event that resulted in cops, lies and assault. I disappeared and he\u2019s stuck in This city and I am 300 miles away. I filed a police report for the assault, and now 300 emails later he\u2019s under investigation for harassment. He also has a warrant out for his arrest for the assault. How did I get that against him? He stupidly admitted in email to a lot of his wrong doings against me, voice recorded himself and emailed his apology. Detectives traced his email to his IP address. Admission to the assaults, the harassment against me, my family and my friends. He now claims he\u2019s the victim of assault and bashing me all over Facebook and Instagram. I\u2019ve found peace because I know the lies, the cheating and the abuse(mentally, emotionally and physically) was all him. I left out a lot of scenarios that would just make anyone\u2019s jaw drop, but going through all this it opened my eyes to what a true narcissist looked like. All the empty promises to change, the manipulation, trying to convince me the reason we fought so much was because there was so much passion, that love looked like this and it was normal. He hid his alcoholism, well he tried. I was paranoid, but it was admitted to in email he was an addict. He told me he cheated time and time again only to hurt me and there was no truth. Now, I am happily engaged and getting married in 2020. We work....no crazy, unhealthy fighting, lying, manipulation and he\u2019s not an undercover alcoholic.

I\u2019ve struggled to understand the difference here, but I think I got it and would appreciate some feedback from the community. \n\n\nWith both of these phrases there\u2019s an implication that gets left out and that is whether or not the person saying these things contributed in some way to the other person\u2019s feelings. For instance, if person A punches person B in the face and person B expresses pain it would be foolish for person A to say either of these phrases as they would be rejecting any responsibility for the situation while shifting all of it to the victim. Note that this would apply even if person A had an \u201cuncontrollable limb\u201d disorder that caused them to randomly punch others (in that case they\u2019re responsible for recognizing their challenge, getting help for it, and minimizing the damage they cause to those around them). \n \n\nAlso note that a bystander could rightfully say to person B \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re hurting\u201d without anyone jumping in to chastise them for a supposed \u201cfauxpology.\u201d And once again, it\u2019s because of how responsible the bystander is for person B\u2019s pain (in this case, they\u2019re not). If person B shoved the bystander away out of anger from being punched, the bystander could rightfully say to person B \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re hurting, but I\u2019m not responsible for your feelings and what you did hurt me.\u201d\n\n\nDoes this make sense? I\u2019ve struggled with the distinctions here because my nex would consistently claim she wasn\u2019t responsible for my feelings to which I would reply \u201cWhile you\u2019re not responsible for them directly, you are responsible for the things you do that cause those feelings.\u201d I\u2019ve taken many of her fauxpologies and arguments to the internet and usually found clear indications things weren\u2019t normal, but this one idea (that we aren\u2019t responsible for another\u2019s feelings) sticks out as something deemed acceptable, at least by the internet.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I posted in raisedbynarcissists but didn't get much feedback. Wondering if anyone else had similar happen. \n\nAs a child I can remember my father telling me that someday I would need an EpiPen. That I would develop life threatening allergies and I'd just have to live with it. I remember him saying this as young as like four or five. I was absolutely terrified by it and he thought that was funny. He constantly talked about it. \n\nEvery fall I would fall asleep with them scratching my back and my back would have welts and hives all over it. They just thought that my skin was sensitive I guess? It wasn't all year around. But the possibility that perhaps I already had outdoor allergies never once crossed their mind then apparently.  \n\nWhen I turned 14 in the Fall I started breaking out in hives all the time. Full body. From everything. I'd eat and have hives. I'd not eat and have hives. All the hives. But it was almost as if I got hives every two hours regardless of what I ate. A family member once gave me a dose of epi because I had a bit of trouble swallowing and they rushed me to the hospital and acted like I wasn't going to make it. The hospital said I had a panic attack. \n\nAnyway, long story short one family member decided I had Celiac and over the course of the next year I no longer ate gluten, soy, dairy, eggs, and a host of other things. \n\nIt has been a decade now and my physician now did more up to date allergy testing. For some reason none of my \"food allergies\" ever showed. Lo and behold, this test showed I have no true food allergies. It did show that I have moderate inhalation allergies (outdoor, air freshener, etc). When my allergy testing was done a decade ago I know ragweed showed up severely on my test, but my parents never said a word about it or what that would mean. I was never offered any medicine or appointment with a doctor to deal with that. It had to be food allergies that wasn't showing up on testing. \n\nI've been on a very restricted diet because of this for a decade. It caused a whole host of health problems and problems during pregnancy. \n\nI'm in the beginning stages of even beginning to process this. Right now even if I dont eat I have symptoms which is what made me suspicious.\n\nWe are in peak outdoor allergy season though! I guess I believed I did have food allergies for so long because I do have cross reactivity to things like apples in the fall. Even when cooked. \n\nI don't know how to process. I don't understand why they didn't explore the whole severe allergy to ragweed on my test. The more logical option was that I was magically allergic to all food?!? \n\nSo now I'm trying to figure out what is even normal for outdoor allergies, symptom wise and treatment wise. My son has them too and I don't want him to be miserable and scared about it like I was for my entire life. Everyone keeps telling me to take zyrtec but I'm so scared of ingesting new things I haven't had the guts to try it. \n\nWas this abuse? Neglect? There was other abuse going on but with a medical professional in the family I trusted, especially as a kid, that they were right. The craziest thing to me is that for years and years they talked about the day I'd almost die and have to stab myself with an EpiPen. For a decade before I even had consistent allergy symptoms. Who does that? And why? I'd never do that to my son. \n\nI guess my main questions are, how do I think about this and any advice on dealing with outdoor allergies?", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I was so overwhelmed by his collective behavior that I vented to a friend about it. I felt guilty spilling the beans about our relationship because it felt like a betrayal to\n talk about it with someone outside of our relationship. She listened silently and when I was done she simply replied back \u201cHaving a relationship with a narcissist is hard.\u201d Her father was a diagnosed narcissist and she felt like she noticed similarities. \n\nMy reaction was no, no way, not my husband. My husband is not a narcissist. If anything I have things I could be working on. I didn\u2019t even want to know what the signs were, I just knew it wasn\u2019t true.\n\nOur relationship has not gotten any better over the past couple years and recently on YouTube I stumbled across a video about narcissism, I watched and was a little shook but also hesitant to come up with any conclusions, I\u2019m not a psychologist and I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my place to diagnose, but after years of blaming myself and my own bad behavior for our failing relationship I finally felt like I was hearing something that made sense. \n\nI really want to share my story here anonymously just to get a little perspective on my situation. I honestly want to know if I\u2019m overreacting, I\u2019m sorry if this posts ends up a little lengthy.\n\nThe beginning of our relationship was overwhelming with kindness and generosity. He would always want to take me to the fanciest dinners, he\u2019d send flowers to my work, he would even try taking me shopping for fancy designer bags within days of us dating (which I refused but appreciated the offer). He was such a charmer and a charmer around my parents and friends. I noticed little things here and there, his temper could be set off by small stuff, like being stuck in traffic. But his reactions to small stuff seems disproportionately big. If he\u2019s upset with traffic he yells and curses, honks his horn even if it\u2019s a complete stand still and there\u2019s nothing anyone can do. The first few times this happened I laughed at him thinking he was just having a bad day and told him to chill out, we\u2019d get there when we get there, but he literally ignored me, zero reaction, I might as well had not existed and continued to rage all the way to the destination. This bothers me because we don\u2019t live in the safest city and it\u2019s not unheard of for someone to get shot in traffic for giving someone else the bird, but any time I\u2019ve tried to talk to him about how this bothers me he shuts me down saying that he is a right to his emotions and I\u2019m trying to shame him into not feeling what he feels.\n\nAfter a while the anger became more prevalent and it especially seemed to come out over things I viewed to be as double standards. He would go out with friends after work and not tell me what he was doing, which I was always chill about because I didn\u2019t want to be in one of those relationships where I was constantly monitoring what we was doing. But if I stayed out with friends, telling him I was doing so, eventually it would come up in a fight that I \u201cdidn\u2019t care about him\u201d. In fact the phrase \u201cYou don\u2019t care about me\u201d started becoming a theme anytime he is unhappy with what I\u2019m doing. Even something like leaving a dish in the sink becomes \u201cYou don\u2019t care about me.\u201d\n\nI started noticing these \u201cyou don\u2019t care about me\u201d fights would come up especially if there was an event we were headed to that was with my friends or I organized. For instance I had a close friend who was getting married, I had to work on the day of her wedding but she was getting married in the evening so I would just have to go home and change right after work so I could leave on time for the ceremony. Before I left the house I told my husband the invite was on the refrigerator and asked him to make sure he was ready when I got home. He was off from work all day and had nothing going on. When I got home he was still in sweatpants on the couch, he hadn\u2019t showered yet, and I asked him \u201cAre you going to get ready?\u201d He flipped out at this question, told me I didn\u2019t properly prepare him for what time the event was at. He told me he was no longer going because he didn\u2019t have time to get ready and told me if I would have added the event to our Apple calendar he would have known what was going on. When I pointed out that I told him about the invite he acted like that wasn\u2019t a good enough source of information. He concluded by saying I obviously didn\u2019t care about him and didn\u2019t want him to go otherwise I would have given him more of a heads up about what we were doing. This actually became a theme in multiple other events I tried to plan for us, where he would nope out last minute and tell me it was my fault for not giving him enough information ahead of time, even if I had informed him on date and time well in advance and if he forgot something or had a question he could ask me.\n\nThings were always tedious but really started to take a turn when I started to have some pretty big success in my field of work. He was always the breadwinner of the relationship but over that past few years I have become fairly recognized in my industry for being in the very top of what I do. I started getting invited to industry events, companies would pay for trips for me, send me gifts, I accumulated a large social media presence. I love my work and I love what I do, I\u2019m very passionate about it and I find what I do for a living to be extremely fun, rewarding, and fulfilling. My work, however, began being a threat to my husband and became another thing for him to point to and say I don\u2019t care about him.\n\nMy husband has always been a workaholic, it\u2019s very rare for him not to come home from work, plop on the couch, and immediately pull his computer out and work late into the night. I always admired his passion for what he did and tried not to give him a hard time about. Neither of us want kids and I always felt this gave us a bigger opportunity to explore what we are passionate about. But when I started falling in love with my work and having such overt success with it my husband started resenting my own late nights and extra hours put in. In his eyes I was putting in extra hours to avoid being with him, even though \u201cbeing with him\u201d means sitting on a couch watching TV while he continued working. This double standard is still frequently an issue in our relationship. I still consider my job to be the biggest strain on our relationship. I cant even talk about my work with him anymore.\n\nHe refuses to listen to any advice or criticism and if something goes wrong it\u2019s my fault. A couple of years ago my parents were going to be coming in town and staying with us for Christmas. I told him I was going to add a floating buffet to our dining room with IKEA cabinets so that we would have a place to set food. I am very handy and this was a simple, straightforward project I was able to get done in one day with minimal mess. My husband informed me that he wanted to add smart light switches to every room in the house and was going to hire someone for this. It was only two weeks before Christmas and I told him I thought he should wait until after New Years to do that because a rewiring project was going to be a lot, and would probably make a big mess since it involved cutting into the walls and in my line of work Christmas time is very busy and I would t have time to clean any additional messes aside from straightening up the house for my family. He told me it wasn\u2019t fair that I got to do a project before the holidays and he didn\u2019t, and also said we wouldn\u2019t even need the smart switches except I kept leaving lights on around the house so now he had to get them. \n\nHe hired someone who wasn\u2019t a real electrician and this person destroyed our house. The worst of it was the guest room which was covered in thick white dust from sanding spakle, and the handyman hadn\u2019t bothered to lay protection down over a single surface. I told my husband repeatedly I didn\u2019t have time to clean this, he ignored me, and two days before my parents were supposed to come in town I was now angry about the fact he hadn\u2019t cleaned the guest room and asked him to help me clean in. He flew into a rage, stomped into the room, started throwing everything out into the halls, breaking stuff. I was crying and begging him to stop and he just yelled that it was his stuff and he was allowed to break it if he wanted. He then accused me again of not telling him well enough it advanced that my parents were coming even though I had told him a month ahead of time and added it to the Apple calendar this time knowing what his usual excuses were and trying to avoid a fight, but apparently it\u2019s unavoidable.\n\nWe went to therapy briefly, we had sessions together and he would go on his own. The therapist eventually told him in a private session that she felt like he resented me because of my success in my industry and recognition from my peers (my husband has always dreamed of having this kind of recognition in his own work), and he got angry about this accusation and decided to stop seeing her.\n\nAt one point my husband stopped having sex with me for a year and a half. The crazy thing is he would come home sometimes and brag about how his coworkers think I\u2019m the hottest spouse of anyone who works there. He would always get excited when someone else found me attractive or was impressed by my work achievements. He would even brag about all of my achievements to friends and coworkers, all while in private not wanting to talk to me about my work anymore because he was \u201csick of hearing about it\u201d. It sometimes feels like he cares more about how I  make him look to other people and how he can use my status to elevate himself than he actually cares about me.\n\nThere\u2019s more, so many more examples, and from all of this you may be wondering where is the good? But my husband is so hot and cold, sometimes he is very \u201con\u201d and he does genuinely seem like a loving and caring person, but the off side comes out eventually. People I introduce him to would never ever guess what he was like in private. He is kind, charming, and charismatic when he needs to make an impression. I\u2019ve threatened to leave him before and those are the times where he tries to shape up his act, but the anger always comes out.\n\nWe were just in Mexico for a whole week together and yesterday my first day back I spent the whole day cleaning the house after he complained that I needed to do something about it. I did so hoping that I would be able to use this weekend to catch up on work without being accused of not caring about him because I am working instead of cleaning the house. This morning he asked if we could get dinner tonight and I told him I might be working still tonight and he got upset, and now I know the \u201cyou don\u2019t care about me because you won\u2019t spend time with me\u201d argument is coming, even though we just spent a solid week together and last night when he came home from work he immediately got on his computer and didn\u2019t do much as offer to help clean.\n\nI\u2019m so depressed with the constant back and forth, I honestly don\u2019t even know if I care if it\u2019s his fault or my fault anymore, sometimes I feel like I just suck at relationships and shouldn\u2019t be in one. I go between being angry at him and questioning myself because he does being valid complaints against me from time to time. I find myself spinning my wheels trying to be perfect for him but nothing seems to work and nothing is good enough. I guess I am just to the point where I don\u2019t know what to do anymore because the cycle is so predictable and at this point I feel like a psychic who knows what\u2019s going to happen before it happens. I\u2019ve always struggled with severe anxiety and depression but when I can predict one of the fights that\u2019s going to happen I find myself in a standstill with anxiety, and  flounder trying to answer his questions knowing I am being led to a fight I am desperately trying to avoid.

He just loves to look at me with an arrogant \u201cpolite\u201d smile on his face, a very forced calmness in his voice, only to tell me the most hurtful things to ever come out of somebody\u2019s mouth. He\u2019ll also put it in a way so it sounds like he\u2019s just trying to talk to me about stuff that bothers him, so when I counter it, I look like a jerk not willing to listen to him.\n\nA nice example:\n\nI\u2019m a big girl, and not the \u201coh gee I\u2019m fat at a whopping 100lbs soaking wet\u201d, but more like the \u201cwhy is this xxl too small for me\u201d kind of fat. As is he. Just saying it like it is, not bodyshaming or anything. No point in sugarcoating it (otherwise I\u2019d eat it, lol). I know I\u2019m an emotional eater, but he REALLY can\u2019t control himself. I\u2019m talking downing close to a gallon of icecream and then stealing my pint when I\u2019m sleeping. It\u2019s bad.\n\nPoint is, he blames me. In order for him to start exercising and dieting, he DEMANDS me I first show him that I\u2019m determined to do so as well. I\u2019m not allowed anything he deems bad for me, some things are just a huge exaggeration. But I digress. \n\nSince I\u2019m an emotional eater, I can\u2019t cope with all the stress and abuse, resulting in me failing my mandatory diet.\n\nNow on to his way of dealing with this. I\u2019ll come home from a good day at work, and he\u2019ll be sulking. At first, when I ask what\u2019s wrong, he\u2019ll mention his father, who died in February this year. When I sit down to comfort him, he\u2019ll start saying things like \u201cyou\u2019ll never lose weight\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019ll never be able to do it\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t trust you\u201d, \u201cyou just refuse to do what I tell you to do\u201d. Trying to reason with him will always result in him rolling his eyes at me and commenting on how I can\u2019t take any criticizm, how He\u2019s scared to talk about his feelings because I will not listen to him, I will only defend myself. \n\nAfter about an hour of mentally toying with me, I sometimes lose it and start screaming at him to stop it and leave me alone. Cursing ensues, mostly on my part. All he then says is see, you\u2019re awful to talk to. I\u2019m calm, sweet and nice to you and you just yell at me for no reason.\n\nNo matter how I play it, he always wins. So here I am, baking brownies at my parents place while he\u2019s at work. I did finally get him to agree to therapy, but it took years of begging and pleading and has only now worked because He\u2019s depressed and wants help with his depression. Let\u2019s just hope the therapist will see through him and he will get the help he needs, not the help he\u2019ll manipulate them into thinking he needs, like shelter from me or something like that...\n\nAnybody recognize this behaviour?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I've been out of my abusive relationship for 2.5 months - seems like forever ago - my emotions have kind of plateaued.  I'm like a steady 5 - kind of feel numb - like a dull ache I know is still there even though I try to stay busy and active.  \n\nThe 1st few days out I felt immediate relief - my body reacting to not being on overdrive all the time - read alot about the chemical imbalances the ups and downs that abusive relationships cause - I can only imagine the level of cortisol my body was producing at the time - but then that overwhelming urge to be around her again - the initial withdrawal was so intense  - I was so addicted - it's insane how conditioned you can become - needing this awful person who broke you to feel better - knowing they are not good in any shape or form but just wanting to feel relief - to feel normal - those words stuck in my head - this is far from normal - it's pure insanity.\n\nBy the end of the 1st month I was probably around 6 - 7 - was hiking ever day - joined a flag football team - completely overwhelmed myself with activities - unfortunately I sprained my ankle trying to blitz the QB - so that put me on the couch for a few days which resulted in me binge watching the 100 - all seasons.\n\nMonth two - being unable to walk / hike definitely set me back - my thoughts have been back to missing her more and I started checking her social media - the act calmed me so I had to fight the urge to use it as a coping mechanism - dangerous the mind can be - playing tricks again but I've done so much reading on abuse, trauma bonding, breaking the cycles, and healing I could teach a class by now.  Wasnt going to allow myself to fall prey into dependency.  Healing is done by working THROUGH the pain - rebuilding yourself - no quick fixes I assure you.\n\nThis week I'm preparing for a job interview with a start up company - excited about the possibility - was a nice reminder to myself that my life is mine and at some point when I want to allow someone back in it I'll be better equipped to handle it because of my ex.

I am nowhere near balding. \n\nThe narc brushed her fingers through my hair one night after some slight devaluing of my interests and hobbies earlier that day. And she says to me...\n\n\"Oh honey.

Sad and confused by all the gaslighting, yes, but I never got that bad. Always had hope.

Afterward she went to get suicide promise tattoos with him. This all took place in the middle of her campaign to convince me I was suicidal.\n\nIn addition to this -after I started no contact- she started spreading a rumor that I was emotionally cheating on her with an old friend who tried to drive me to suicide, but she had somehow saved my life.

WHY DO I KEEP GOING BACK TO MY nEX FIANCE?! Why do I keep letting him back into my safe place?! He is now back in my home and plays with me every. single. day. I can't leave the house or move out because I own the house and he is not understanding my pleas to get him to leave. I asked him yesterday to leave after realizing how sick it was that I almost killed myself over him and he said \"I am so worried about you. I am not going anywhere.\" (he doesn't know about my attempt)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am too weak with too big of a heart to pack up his shit and change the locks while he is at work despite therapists and friends telling me this is the only way... Why do I feel badly for my abuser?! I am so mortified by my addiction to this abuse...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am hanging on by a thread counting down the days until he closes escrow on a house that he bought. He begged to move back to the home I own after we shared an apartment, I got rid of my tenants, we moved back, he left me 3 times in the 6 weeks we have been back, and now he is buying his own home 10 minutes away behind my back and told me \"it's not my money\" when I asked him why he didn't tell me. I told him I won't be moving with him. He has become desperate and said that he will let me live there for free... I never wanted to come back to my house unless he was coming with me because the financial burden is huge, but doable. I always had roommates before. I am so fucked up mentally that the idea of seeking out new people and inviting strangers into my home is TERRIFYING. I might just suck it up and live on a super tight budget for a few months to recover... I am praying that he doesn't fall out of escrow on the overpriced house that he is buying, that is beyond his means, so that he will voluntarily walk away. I don't even get to sleep in my own master bedroom in the house that I paid for because sleeping next to my abuser makes me sick.  \n\n\nLast night he came home late and I was already asleep. He routinely wakes me up since he gets home after I go to bed and says that he needs attention, wants to talk, or wants sex. He wanted sex last night and me to sit next to him while he ate his dinner. I said no. I didn't want anything to do with him since yesterday he was Venmoing me for things that he had bought for me lately (a routine tactic of his). His Venmo requests have ranged from a $10 sandwich to a $2000 fence he installed at my house without asking. I turn over and go back to sleep and next thing I know I wake back up to rustling and him walking out of the bedroom. I ask what he's doing and he yells \"I AM GOING TO JACK OFF BECAUSE YOU WON'T MAKE LOVE TO ME. IS THAT OK?!!?!?\" I don't even respond. This is a new low even for him. He comes back into bed and tells me his blue balls are painful. I get up and he says OH THERE YOU GO WALKING AWAY AGAIN. DON'T FORGET TO GO TEXT YOUR OTHER BOYFRIENDS AND GIVE THEM THE ATTENTION THEY WANT. I went and went back to sleep in the other room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went into the master bedroom and said goodbye before I left for work this morning and he grabbed me and tried to kiss me and said I love you. I didn't kiss him. I said last night crossed the line for me. He said we can talk about it this weekend and I said there is really nothing to talk about. HOW DOES HE ALWAYS ACT LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED AND THAT I LOVE YOU IS THE END ALL BE ALL?! I feel like A CRAZY PERSON. We haven't spoken all day and now I just get a text from him \"Hope you're having a great day!\" \n\nI have combed this thread for hours today at work hoping to find something about someone leaving their Narc when the Narc has rooted themselves in the victim's home. No luck. Mostly just people who can pack their bags and leave. Unfortunately this isn't an option for me now unless I just keep paying the mortgage on a house I don't live in until he closes escrow.

Just more personal experiences with the nEx I left about a month ago. I got frustrated with him so wanted to share, to unload here. \n\nI was waiting for it. nEx started with the petty BS as soon as I left... sending emails to the wrong place, constantly writing long diatribes about his life, moving everything in the house when I went back to get my stuff, hiding my child's birth certificate... on and on. \n\nBut, for the most part, he was still trying to convince everyone that I was the crazy one by being super cooperative and agreeable. My family already knew exactly what he was and what to expect from him when I told them about everything. So while he might have convinced someone uninvolved, he proved to my people over and over again the gaslighting he put me through for years with this petty nonsense. \n\nHe cooperated long enough for me to get the visitation paperwork in order. He didn't fight anything, really seemed to not care at all, and I'm sure he doesn't. He'll just use the child to get at me anyway. The only thing he balked at was the use of an official coparenting app for communication. I assume because he can't gaslight me that way or constantly talk about himself, and because the communications are admissable in court. It stayed in the paperwork though... he was still maintaining nice guy status so didn't fight it hard, but I know it bothered him.\n\nNow the day of the first visitation is upon us, and he absolutely cannot resist. And it is absolutely ridiculous. Worse than I could have imagined honestly. First, I sent him the visitation forms to sign. The signature page formatting was screwed up in the copy I sent. I downloaded another copy and printed the signature page from that for mine. Meanwhile, he tried to whine about a notary costing $50 (lol), then he printed the screwed up signature page instead of fixing it and had that notarized. I guess he thought it would bother me that it looked ridiculous, but *he* had to pay the notary to stamp it twice, and I told him if the court wouldn't accept it that way he would have to pay again. *shrug*\n\nI left half a box of diapers with him when I left. He claims there are no diapers there, but he's going to be helpful and buy a pack on the way to pick up my child. I *know* there are diapers there, so the gaslighting is on full display. \n\nHe is offering to bring me things I left behind when I went to get my stuff. (This is how I got sucked in, but never again!) None of it is important or I would have grabbed it. I asked about the birth certificate. I know where it was and it wasn't there, so I know he has it. He claims he hasn't seen it but doesn't want me to have to get a new copy so he will absolutely definitely look for it.\n\nHe is trying to make me think I left a photo album behind. He said there was one there that was \"gray or purple.\" I have both those colors and he knows it. I told him I left behind a brown empty one, but I didn't know what he was talking about because I had all my albums. But that if he found any pictures I forgot, I would like them back. For some reason he then mentioned cartoon pictures I printed for my child and hung on the wall. I told him I didn't want those either, that I was talking about \"photos.\" I told him again that I didn't leave any photo albums behind. His response was, \"oh, the purple one is mine and the gray one is empty.\" Umm, wouldn't you check that before you brought it up?\n\nI told him I wanted back a bag that had $50 worth of brand new batteries in it. He said he could definitely bring the rechargeable battery charger, but he didn't know where any of the batteries were. I told him I didn't care about the rechargeable batteries. I described exactly where the regular batteries I was talking about were and that they weren't still there when I came to get my stuff, so he obviously moved them and should know where they are. He didn't mention the batteries again.\n\nAnd finally, the piece de resistance. My fucking pillow. When I got there to get my stuff, he had stuffed a bunch of it in the closet and had boxes piled in front of the closet door. My pillow was one of the things stuffed in the closet. I got it out and set it on the bed, but I forgot to grab it when I left with my stuff. It \"blended in,\" so I forgot to grab it. I also know *he* liked my pillow because we went to the store just a couple months ago to buy him the same one (so he would stop whining about it) and they didn't have them anymore, so he had to get something different. So since he's offering to bring stuff at the child exchange, I tell him not to bring all the crap I don't want, but to bring a couple other things, including my pillow. \"Hmm. I haven't seen your pillow. I'll have to look for it. If I find it I'll bring it.\"  Not only did he know he put it in the closet, it was *on his bed* when I left and he came back home. I tried to be diplomatic about it. \"I'll check my stuff, but I know I left it on the bed. If you want it just say so and you can keep it.\" (As if I want it now he's slept all over it lol.) I check my stuff. No pillow.\n\nThat one got to me a little, especially over a pillow, but it is just such an egregious thing to do, to pretend you haven't seen it when it was obviously impossible to miss. I had already told him I didn't care if he kept all the stuff, I had everything I needed and none of it was worth going back and forth over (I meant begging for and should have said so instead of trying to keep the peace). \n\nSo, when I knew I didn't have my pillow (which I already knew and am already pissed that I second guessed it) I told him that he was doing exactly what I expected him to do, that he was showing who he really was to the people that mattered, and that he could keep any crap he wanted to (which I had already made clear). I also reminded him for the third time that if he didn't bring the notarized signature page, I was leaving with my child. \n\nI know this is what he wants. I remained as neutral as possible, but I couldn't resist the opportunity to call him out on his bullshit and make sure he knew he was acting exactly as expected and that nobody was buying it. I'm hoping that will sting him, but I'm mad at myself for getting sucked into over the pillow. I'm glad I laughed the rest off though, and the rest has been pathetic and  laughable. The pillow would have been too if I didn't let him get me. But for being away from him a month after 6 years of gaslighting and abuse, I'm proud of myself for seeing 95% of it for what it is. And now I know even better what to look for to not get sucked in again. Not to mention, as soon as I have that notarized paper, I won't have to talk to him anymore about anything but my child, that will be on an official app, and I already wrote the stuff off and I won't respond when he inevitably brings it up again.\n\nI finished with telling him there was nothing left for us to talk about. So ofc he responded immediately, but that's the great thing about being free... I don't have to read it and I don't have to listen to his excuses any more!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Giving advice.", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "People that hit the kids are by definition authoritarians. Authoritarians lead the country and the hood into wars, some admitted officially, some colloquially admitted while euphemized in state houses and records rooms, some euphemized entirely and others euphemized entirely, still others secret. They make and enforce foolish and impractical law. They make toxic bosses, and use pain as an instrument of power. They lay unholy waste to civilizations and nature alike. They make illogical and incomprehensible arguments, and are unpredictable and overemotional. They turn homes, firms and nations into climates of aggressive anger. They create frustrating situations and then build cases and attack or otherwise cause to be attacked anyone whatsoever with which they have contact. They are ill adapted to what they feel is unlike them, and to being alone, embarrassed, ignored, replaced or forgotten. When we have contact with abusers, some of it comes off on us, and advice about situations like these are to leave soon, any means necessary, including if necessary, witnessing, suffering and doing other abuses, including against who has done you no wrong.\n\nTo begin in earnest, they cluster together. If this happens to you in a region, it's a red flag that the entire region is overpopulated or wrong for you, or you weren't yourself. It's also a red flag that the person that you fought is fleeing other abuse or has an abusive background. People also tend to cluster together until they resemble each other, and subject to the resemblance, they conform to each other. Therefore if you need to leave one person, you might need to leave everyone there whether it's because all of them are just wrong for you, or all of them are bad people. Also how someone is perceived is more about the person that causes it happened then about them, so you will probably not know which person in the social network is right for you.\n\nFor example if you are born in the countryside in the Deep South, and your parents hit you there on five or six occasions at least, this would be red flagged at the entire Deep South is is wrong for you, whether it's because the region is overpopulated, because you were not yourself, such as if you were drunken, or perhaps it's just wrong for you, such as if you are gay or trans-male. If you are abused or abused in city in California, this is a red flag that you need to leave the country for Mars if you have no migraines, or into England if you are suffering from migraines. Perhaps the region is overpopulated or you or someone else picked up the wrong substance from San Francisco when did you did not know what you were smoking, or perhaps the United States has a punitive legal culture that doesn't fit you, especially now that you received police attention. These are human cultural universals, so if you have these problems in England, then perhaps you need to leave to Mars, or perhaps this town is just one that is within reach of who may or may not be poisoning you with mothballs. Perhaps in the next town there are no mothballs.\n\nPerhaps your region has extractive institutions (i.e. the nation is toxic due to enterprises of toxic countrymen) in it. Or perhaps you even rightly or wrongly think this the region will be hit with a nuclear strike. If there is such a thing as a nuclear strike, then being overpopulated or corrupt means that the place provides more people for the strike to kill, and is probably a prowar region, both of which would make the region more likely to be attacked. Whether you are right or wrong about the strike, in either case you need to leave.\n\nIf there is abuse in your situation, be reckless, ruthless and impatient to leave. Research, make and carry out a plan. Don't allow poverty to deter you. Don't delay to build a case or to prove a point. Enter your destination by being kind, speaking your mind, and be yourself, and be not ruthless. England then Ventura or something awaits the infirm. Mars awaits the fit.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I have been reflecting on how my nex discarded me, and I wanted to see if anyone had the same/similar experience as me. \n\nBasically, I had asked my nex to hang out with me in my brand new apartment. It was the first day of me living in my new place in my favorite city in the world, and I wanted to share my happiness with my nex. He comes over, and as soon as I open the door, I see him standing there hysterically crying. \"What's wrong?!?!\" I ask. I was in shock as anyone would be if they saw someone they loved standing in the doorway hysterically crying. He walks over to my bed and sits on it. \"I can't be with you anymore,\" he said, still hysterically crying. I was in shock\n\nI sat in front of him and literally had nothing to say. He continued by telling me how great I am and how successful I will be in life but he does not see himself with me any longer because he does not know what his future looks like. He still wants me in his life though and keeps telling me that I did nothing wrong. He claimed that \"we need to grow on our own.\" He was hysterical the entire time. I sat there blankly because all of these emotions hit me all at once. I was numb; basically in the same way I had felt when he would go on his rants about me. When he got up to leave I started crying because that's when I realized that he was actually leaving me. He told me that he would \"see me soon,\" and left. There I was in my brand new apartment which he had infected with his bad vibes on day 1. I was pissed.\n\nLater that night, I saw a snap story of him at a party CHUGGING a handle of vodka. Lovely start of the growth process for him. He has not reached out to me at all. I keep seeing snap stories of him grinding on other girls, partying, destroying gifts I had bought him, etc. He still has my things that I kept at his place. I sent his stuff back to him in the mail to get the last of the bad vibes out of the apartment. \n\nBasically, I am so angry with him for a number of reasons. The biggest reason being that he claims that he still wants me in his life, yet acts completely opposite of that statement. I guess that's a narcissist thing? I muted him and his friends on all social media, yet he is always the first person to view/like anything I post. I refuse to reach out to him. I guess my main thing is that he put on a whole show when he decided to leave me and is acting exactly opposite of this show.

We have three kids, 5, 4, and 11 months. When we were first married, I worked part time while going to grad school, and I used my money (and student loans) to pay our rent and bills, my car insurance, and health insurance for our family. I also bought most of our groceries and diapers for 2.5 years. We moved back to his hometown where he had a house that he had been paying the mortgage on while I finished grad school. \nI continued to work part time for a year, three evenings a week, then stopped when he said he would  rather get a second job than spend three evenings with our difficult children. Although I did not like the thought of being wholly dependent on him (financially), I agreed. After a rough 6 months of not working, I took an online job for $500/month, but he would not watch the kids while I worked, not even for 30 minutes. I would wake at 4:00 AM to try to work, but my kids, who were terrible sleepers, would wake and cry until I sat in their bed with them. After a year of doing a terrible job, I was fired. I was humiliated. \nIt has been two years since I\u2019ve had a real job. I babysit from time to time. But that only brings $75/month. My baby has been colicky and fussy, and it\u2019s been a rough year. \nMy husband does not allow me to see \u201chis\u201d bank account.  I cannot make purchases unless I check with him first. I also have to use paper checks because he doesn\u2019t want me to have a debit card linked to his account. He does not allow me to use the credit card, either, unless he has approved of the purchase. I bought dog medicine last week for $50 and he called me to ask about it within an hour of the purchase\u2014he has set up alerts to see all purchases I make. \nI have asked many times to sit down with him and go over our budget. He refuses. I have suggested apps that will help us work together financially. I am not a big spender, so it\u2019s not as though I need to be \u201creined in.\u201d My purchases are for food, gas, medicine, and diapers. I clothes shop at the thrift store\u2019s $2 bag sale days. I am frugal, resourceful. I have built bookshelves and bar stools from scrap wood I\u2019ve scavenged from dumpsters. I have gone out to eat maybe four times in the last year. I do buy art supplies for the kids when I can. I also want them to have good shoes, because once my son fell from stairs into a tile floor,  and he sustained a concussion\u2014because his shoes were cheap felt-bottomed and caused him to slip. \n\nMy husband is an alcoholic who spends approx $300+ per month on beer and tobacco. He also buys fast food. And fish bait, and ammunition for hunting, He has donated money to causes without talking to me first. He became very, very angry when I asked what the long term plan was when he co-signed a loan for his sister ($275,000) without talking to me about it first. He said I didn\u2019t trust him and he couldn\u2019t believe I would question his judgement. \nWhen he asked me to attend his best friend\u2019s wedding (a two hour drive) with our children (he had arrived a few days before), I did so, but I had to borrow my mother\u2019s credit card, because I had no way to pay for fuel if a gas station was closed or would not accept paper out-of-town checks. \nHe was angry with me later because I did not ask him in advance if I could borrow a credit card. \nHe takes pride in his credit score, but has let my student loans go into collections because he did not pay on them (as he had agreed to do), and did not tell me about it. \nHe stopped paying the bill for our third baby\u2019s birth. He said, \u201cmedical bills don\u2019t affect credit.\u201d When the sheriff\u2019s deputy served me with court papers for nonpayment, I was humiliated and so sad. My husband then decided to make payments to avoid my getting arrested. \nOur state tax return was garnished by the state for nonpayment of my student loan. Once again, I did not know he was not paying on the loans. \nMost of the time he gets the mail before I do (it\u2019s a PO Box). He throws away the church flyer, and I\u2019m not sure what else before I see it. \nA few days ago I asked if I could write a check for medicine, or if I could use his credit card (our son was sick and running a high fever). \nHe said, \u201cwhat happened to the $30 I gave you Saturday.\u201d \nMe: \u201cI spent it on food.\u201d \nHim: \u201cI thought you said you had cash?\nMe: \u201cI spent $60 on food and diapers last week.\u201d\nHim: \u201cI\u2019ll have to check the account.\u201d \nThen he left the house without saying a word about the money. \nI had to borrow money from my mom to buy medicine for my kid. \nLater, when my husband found out I had borrowed money from my mom, he became angry with me and said I shouldn\u2019t be borrowing money. He let me use the credit card for two days (to buy more Advil, apple juice, popsicles for the sick kiddo) then he took the card back.\nOh, he also canceled health insurance for me and the kids until I could get on state insurance (at his urging) by claiming he had abandoned us. Same story for WIC. \nSo I guess, what I\u2019m asking is, is this normal? Or is this abuse?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I know it's my responsibility to deal with my jealousy and insecurity and to walk from a relationship if someone insists on repeating behavior that I find inappropriate, and she is not doing anything wrong by having a sexual past, but I didn't. That said, she just kept reminding me of these other men from her past, some of whom she was still in contact with just \"as friends\".\n\n- She suggested we get STI tests since we were sleeping together so I did. When I asked her if she had gotten hers she said \"no, but I had unprotected sex with a sex-ed teacher before we got together and I figure he's clean so I must be good\"....so she sent me out on an errand which she didn't follow through on herself, and used it as a reason to once again remind me of her sexual past, and didn't care about my health enough to actually get tested...\n\n- trying to force me to say and do things I'd clearly said I don't want to...little, seemingly innocuous things. Like she really wanted me to say I was \"woke\" and I refused, mostly just because I didn't like that she had told me to say something, and she kept coming back to it for weeks. She also tried to force me to eat chocolate when I said I didn't want to eat it before bed because it would affect my sleep. She tried 3 or 4 times to get me to eat it.\n\n- planned to adopt a second cat for over a month and was constantly telling me how she wasn't going to tell her room mate even though he would likely object...she had some guilt but just kept justifying it to herself and talking to me about how she would manipulate the situation and her room mate in to accepting the new cat.\n\n- told me \"a lot of men like to be called daddy in bed\" and I told her I don't want to hear about what other men like to be called in bed, and she claimed that she just meant that she had gleaned this knowledge from her work friends because she works in the restaurant and bar industry where \"everyone likes to get drunk and bang, but not me because I'm the sober loser\" (we met in recovery, she is sober for sure, but still...). Then she said \"I'm a romantic, I like to be called \"Baby\" in bed...but not by you, it would be weird if you called me that\".\n\n- she called me over to her apartment desperately wanting me to be with her, as she often did, then when I sat down on the couch and accidentally bumped the remote control and turned the show on the tv off she said \"GOD why are you here?\".\n\n- is applying for a semester abroad and when I expressed that I'm sad and would miss her (even though I support her going and following her path and told her this!) she just told me to \"be cool, don't think about it\", eg- don't feel your feelings\n\n- after some pretty intense love making early on in the relationship where we both were enjoying it intensely and I said \"that was amazing\" she said \"it was pretty good\"\n\n- plus she would constantly change plans without notifying me, my schedule was secondary to her frantic and capricious schedule, she would be distant and hostile much of the time and then loving and affectionate in small doses. \n\n- she would gently mock or belittle my taste in music, my tattoos, my friends, even the \"weird\" places I've travelled. I just never knew if she would mock something about me and didn't feel I could honestly express my likes and dislikes to her without subtle put downs.\n\n- constant texts, even before our first date, tons of compliments, talk of marriage and kids and she would constantly want to be with me, but also tell me we \"weren't bf/gf\" because she didn't like labels. She would suggest we do things like go get groceries and cook dinner and she would hold my hand in the grocery store and then she would make puking gestures and say \"Oh gross, we're doing couple stuff in a very derogatory tone\".\n\n- didn't introduce me to her friend when we ran in to her, I just stood there like an idiot until I eventually walked away and then got in trouble for walking away \n\n-constant criticism and gossip of other people, places, and things....she could be positive about lots of stuff, but there was so much criticism and put downs everywhere we went. She said it made her feel good to talk shit about people.\nI dunno...not as bad as what I hear many other people going through but there were constant red flags.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Going solo with my little girl who was 2 at the time.\n\nShe love bombed her like crazy, made me feel like she was the ideal step parent.\n\nGradually this apparent love for my daughter turned into a toxic relationship where she was noticeably threatened by our bond and grew competitive and overly critical, cold, snappy.  \n\nIf I got angry at how she treated her she'd work real hard for a while and then it would slip again gradually.\n\nShe tried to gaslight me for too long about the struggles of being a step-parent and how if the child wasn't behaved it affected bonding.

You can't make someone develop a bond with someone.\n\nI felt so upset that she couldn't embrace the opportunity to be at least some kind of constructive role model to my daughter.  I never put expectations on her to be her mum.  A friend would have been nice.  I explained to her when entering this relationship that she was ultimately my GF and if she felt comfortable she could grow into being a parent figure for her.  She had that choice and there was no time limit or expectations.\n\nBut she said on countless times how she wanted to be her mum and was proud to be that person.  She was critical to her bio mum and wanted my daughter to call her mummy.\n\nShe said those words and for a while I believed them.  Her narrative never changed but her actions totally contradicted these words. If anything she tried to kill my daughter's spirit and hated her being the centre of attention even if she thoroughly deserved it.  She was bitter about her being centre stage.  So childish.

What I've noticed about her is that she delights in being able to take what I value, what makes me happy, what gives me confidence, away from me. It brings her a sadistic kind of pleasure. I've watched her face when she does this, it's like a game. A game of \"Gotcha!\". It seems that her goal is to strip me of everything that makes me who I am.\n\nFirst, she buttered me up so that she could see what it was that I valued, what it was that made me fulfilled and content. She pretended to like and admire those things about me, my skills, talents, and personality. Then she started to steal those things, become those things. She started talking like me, wearing her hair like I do, and presenting like I do. It's like she's trying to be a better version of me than I am, to show me that I'm not special, that she can take what I have and make it her own.\n\nThen, she made sure to give a coveted project to the very person who had betrayed me in the office. She knew this person had betrayed me because I told her this. And she knew that it would be a huge slap in the face for me to see this person placed into a position of leadership, where they can actually affect my life at work and have power over me. All of this was strategic, and it's all to send me the message that I have no control, and that she can take from me anything I value, or destroy it so that I simply don't have it anymore.\n\nSo. I want to send the message to *watch out* what you reveal to a narcissist. Even if you don't tell them anything, they can get a sense of what you value and what gives you confidence just by observing you. If you're an outgoing person like I am, it's natural to wear your emotions on your face and express yourself freely. But doing this only gives a narcissist more ammo to hurt you with. Whatever you have, whatever you are, they want to take it ALL away from you. And they have no limits as to how far they'll go. So keep yourself stoic and reactionless. Grey rock them all the way.

NOT! SICK! YOU'RE! NOT! SICK!\" while the kid keeps calmly saying, \"I am warning you to not explode,\" after the involuntary and outpatient commitment.\n\n* * yelling at the kid that she is not only the kid's mom, but also his wife.\n\n* * bursting in and glaring.\n\nThis is the part of the post where I attempt to come up with an explanation for this kind of behavior. All told, the patten here is the the toxic authority figure necessitates or makes look necessary a behavior and then claims the behavior is happening and takes revenge. Toxic authority figures' own explanation is that retaliation discourages misbehavior. Cycles of revenge can indeed make some game theoretic sense. In the repeated prisoner's dillemma, defecting in return can enforce cooperation. However, where this is really breaks down and shows why toxic authority figures act this way is, when the real or alleged offense by the kid is not meant as retaliation and when the parent backs down once the kid starts winning the fistfights. The toxic authority figure wants something, and it's not deterring loss of hell containment incidents, nor the original misbehavior, both of which the authority figure partly causes. Though given who is where, when they are they are, who talks to whom, and when they do, someone's perceptions and conduct are more about them than about the other person, the toxic authority figure is mistaken to not take responsibility for their own actions and to insist that their kid or subordinate take responsibility for their own actions. This is because though the above about how it's not about you is technically true, these types of toxic authority figure behaviors create conflict, necessitate or appear to necessitate misbehavior, or otherwise cause frustrating situations as specified above. In other words when you stir up crud, then crud gets on you, when you do stuff like this, there will be retaliation, authority be damned. This means for example, that if you hit someone they are going to punch you. You won't be the only one that gets hit, but the kid punching you is a consequence of this. An explosively harsh and physically punitive parenting style encourages the kids to to believe that retaliation works in real life because in the homes where this does happen, it works to discourage the parent from hitting the kid. In these cases, hitting the parent seems to work. In other words, the parents are themselves the discipline problem. Therefore, the toxic authority figure's explanation doesn't make any sense.\n\nThe simplest explanation that advice community has come up with is that the people involved in such situations are afraid of being alone, ignored, replaced or forgotten. In other words, they have people around them that contribute nothing to them out of fear of being alone, and then they fight them because they want some (attention).\n\nAnother explanation is that humans are morons and the most moronic of all possible cases is the toxic authority figure. They expect someone to stop crying, to focus and learn better when they are threatened, to stop arguing when they are battered, and for it to just generally keep the peace when they are violent towards their housemates in what is otherwise not a physical conflict. One might as well expect clays to stay in the air because they are shot down, for a towel to stay dry because it is plunged into water, for newspaper to not burn up because it is put in the fire starter and the fire starter is put on burning stove, or for a brick to stay together because it is hit with a sledgehammer. What they wish to happen is clearly the opposite of what they want to happen. They wish to get success by means that adequately demonstrated that they want to fail. This is just self-defeating behavior for the sake of self-defeating behavior. I infer this because it is not logical, this syllogism and inference makes sense because it is about toxic authority figures; like other humans, the toxic authority figure is a moron. The toxic authority figure is especially capable of being a complete effing moron because they are usually a current or former substance user, or are in a toxic marriage with their co-parent. Perhaps the future parent rides the bicycle because they put their car up their nose. Or perhaps the parent that's involuntarily committing their kid is high on psych meds that they had the psychiatrist prescribe for them, and their judgment is so compromised that they decide that their kid should be on psych meds as well. Or perhaps the only dating red flags the parents' sad marriage does not exhibit are infidelity and intimate partner violence. Therefore, this may have fried their brain. Combined with the simple fact that they are a human being, this adequately explains why they are a complete effing moron. Humans are, after all, morons.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Growing up in a single-parent household, as most children who have, isn't incredibly easy. But of course, we can't keep on moping on everything we experience so I picked up myself and graduated from secondary school and got into a top course in a polytechnic. This is where it gets confusing for me. My mother has of course worked hard and given a lot to give us food and shelter but lately she's been using that to expect me to respect her. I honestly don'tn after all the abuse that she has done to me and my sister. When I was younger it was a lot of hitting and as I grew older, it was emotional blackmail. Like for example, she wants me to keep telling everyone that my father isn't in the family when I'm with people of power (bosses, lecturers, teachers, principal etc) to gain favour and some form of assistance. I don't deny that we need help but I'm not comfortable bearing everything to people out of the blue unless I want to.\n\nShe had a couple of failed relationships ever since my birth dad and the longest relationship she had ended up in her getting cheated. I stood by her and told her to give him up before she found out and when shit hit the fan she beat my sister and I because we refused to talk to her ex and I've held a grudge against her since then. Fast forward to this year and I had a failed relationship with my ex because she cheated on me. My mum took a liking to her and I didn't tell her what she did to just keep it under wraps and after her questioning I kinda told her and my best friend did too. She kept on jokingly asking if I missed her and I told her to stop. I let it go because even after we broke my mum would still talk to her and let it be. I could no longer take it as she continually popped the question \"do you still like her\" and eventually I snapped and called her stupid.\n\nRight now I'm doing an internship overseas and I'm much happier because I'm away from family and the disappointing experiences but she keeps on calling and texting, questioning where I am and what I'm doing and I told her i just want to be left alone. My tone is kinda nasty but I really do want to be left alone but she keeps on mentioning the raising part and how i should respect her. I sound ungrateful but i do respect her sacrifices but using that against me to gain respect and everything I've endured has me really wanting to break away.

My partner and I would spend pretty much all of our time together. The beginning of our relationship was stressful and rocky because I have a lot of severe depression and trauma, as well as BPD. My partner did, too. I break down a lot, because I live with abusive parents and that constantly erodes my emotions, so that got to be too much for her. I started asking if she had the energy to support me if I wasn't doing well, and if she didn't, I'd find a different way to deal with it. With my depression, though, I was constantly not doing well, which would stress her out. She stopped wanting to go to any social events with me because she didn't ever feel up to it. She'd tell me every single day how stressful I am and how I need to get better fast or else she'd break up with me so I started going to more therapy and even went to a partial hospital program for my mental health, and started working really really hard but those conversations kept happening. I really wanted to get better for her but things kept getting worse. If I do slightly bad, it stresses her out, makes me feel worse because I don't want to hurt her, I repress that and try to help her and it's a feedback loop. She's told me not to talk to some of my friends because she didn't like them. Not all my friends, but a few, one of them is a close friend. I basically never know quite what to do and it's to the point where I'm hiding my feelings from her so she doesn't get destroyed over it. I feel really bad, because, I'm the only friend of hers who she doesn't enjoy spending time with. I feel so dysfunctional. She said being in a relationship with me is like babysitting a child. I've been getting progressively worse with my depression when I'm with her and I really just want to be good for her. She's the only person who has ever been this way with me. None of my close friends or exes have anything like this to say about me. Are they hiding something from me? I want to be able to share my side with her but she attacks me for it, accuses me of attacking her, and told me that I'm hurting her and everybody in my life and that my issues would destroy anybody. She goes from saying \"I hate you\" and kissing me and saying \"I love you\" in the same day. The daily conversations hurt me a lot but I never express that to her out of fear, instead I go to my friends for support and she got jealous that \"the person who absolutely destroyed her has someone to talk to but she doesn't\". I don't counter things like that. I always tell her that her feelings are valid and not to hold back but I'm afraid to say that I'm being hurt by this. I don't want to be an abuser...

He believed he was magical (literally magic mage kind of shit) and I was meant to be his apprentice. I was young and already traumatized from an abusive father and being molested by my cousin when I was 4 or 5, so that made me a prime target. \nHe got me involved in occult things and tried making me believe I was in love with him, and was married to him in a past life. It was just fucking crazy. He controlled so much of my life so subliminally that I had a hard time catching it until I was ready to die from being so fucking miserable. \n\nSkip to the present, almost 8 years after leaving all that (I\u2019m 27 now), I am married to a wonderful man (whom I met at the tail end of my involvement with the narc) and am in therapy. I have so many moments of questioning my sanity and being terrified I am in another abusive relationship. I am learning about my triggers and working through them. It\u2019s sucks so fucking bad. I wish I could just love my partner without any confusion or doubt ever swimming in my head. It certainly is better, now that I understand what I went brought and how it effects me. But damn. When I those moments of terror come up, it feels like it is all happening again and I want to RUN FOR THE HILLS.

He sent me a ton of messages when I left, pretending he wanted to break up too, trying to blame my daughter for everything and act like he was caught in the middle, flat out saying \"there's no abuse happening,\" trying to manipulate me by talking about how our LO must be sad bc he wasn't \"home doing his favorite things\" as if bc nEx wasn't there my LO couldn't play. I ignored him for 4 days, while he got angrier, but still tried to maintain good guy mode in case anyone was eavesdropping. Even had his narc best friend write me and then say \"I didn't tell him to do that.\" Anyway, I couldn't ignore him forever because of LO. Communication started and his ridiculous \"stupid game\" began. He purposely doesn't follow simple directions, or pretends to be confused. Then when I get short with him over it, he blows up about how I'm implying he's stupid. I say... if the shoe fits...\n\n\nI had some technical difficulties the other day trying to post something similar, so I'll try again. Here's a ridiculously long but not complete list of his \"stupid game\" antics...\n\n\nI created one email chain for talking about LO, another for sorting bills and stuff, and asked him to keep it short and sweet. Multiple times a day, almost every email, he purposely responded to the wrong email chain and tried to get me to acknowledge it or tell him again not to do it so he could act confused and innocent. I ignored every message he sent to the wrong chain. He also sent me emails that were long, flowing stories about how great he was doing now. I skimmed them for pertinent info, and told him I didn't have the time or desire to read it, so if I missed something he said in it he would have to repeat himself.\n\n\nI set up video chat for him for LO until I could get the parenting plan finished. I made strict rules about emotional manipulation or trying to suck me into the conversation, even gave a hard time limit. He balked at that and pretended like he didn't know what \"emotional manipulation\" was. I told him he should google it them, bc it was a basic common sense concept. He spent every video chat interrogating LO, acting like a robot (I suppose he couldn't fake feelings when someone else was watching, or wanted me to say something so he could claim he was \"afraid to say the wrong thing\") and even purposely turned off the camera on his end at one point to see if I would give him extra time. I didn't. \n\n\nHe constantly asked questions about common sense stuff. Made me repeat things I had told him in a previous  email. Refused to answer straightforward questions about agreeing to things in the parenting plan. I told him to answer specifically to xyz or I would assume he agreed. Not that it mattered, he obviously couldn't care less about LO and agreed to everything (only tried to push back against the parenting app, funny enough). His only priority was obviously trying to provoke me.\n\n\nThen I finished the parenting plan and told him he had to have it signed and notarized before I gave him LO for the weekend. He complained that a notary would cost $50 (lol), trying to whine and provoke sympathy as if I would tell him to nevermind. I told him any bank would do it for $5. Then he complained that the signature page printed funny, but he was so cooperative he had the notary stamp it twice, just in case. I easily solved it on my end by downloading another copy of the signature page, but you know, whatever. I told him if the court didn't accept his he would have to do it again (guess the cost wasn't a big deal after all?)\n\n\nThen the day of drop off was upon us. He ramped up, and I admit he did suck me in on this. He kept bringing up stuff I left at his house and how he was going to be nice enough to bring it to me. Except he said he was going to bring stuff that was honestly junk I didn't want in the first place. I told him, instead of bringing that, bring this this and this. This convo was so full of gaslighting I honestly can't type it all here, but the highlights were: He tried to convince me I left a photo album (I didn't). When I didn't bite, he claimed he was mistaken nbd. I asked him about a bag full of $50 worth of brand new batteries I left. He had no clue where it was, did I mean some old dead batteries. I told him he had obviously moved it when I went to pick up my stuff because it wasn't where I left it, so just keep it (he was obviously going to anyway, thieving fuck) I refused to beg for anything. I told him I wanted my pillow. I meant to pack it but left it on his bed and forgot it. He claimed he hadn't seen it. That was where he got me. Initially I tried to be diplomatic, which was really falling for the gaslighting. Maybe I packed it in my bedding I said. I actually checked, even though I fucking knew I didn't. Ofc it wasn't there. I was angry at myself for falling for it, and gave him the satisfaction of seeing my anger when I texted him and told him he obviously had it, he could keep it if he wanted it so badly, I expected him to act like this which was fine, he was showing everyone who he really was, and we had nothing more to talk about. He wrote me back, I never read it. \n\n\nI dropped LO off with him. I barely looked at him, refused to look him in the eye. I didn't say 2 words to him. He brought different junk I didn't want and a couple small things I said I did. He brought a bag full of photos that he would only have if he purposely removed them from my stuff, and which he didn't mention having when he tried to convince me I left a photo album. They were all doubles of what was in the photo albums, but whatever. I know I won't get the other stuff back, and I refuse to talk about it again.\n\n\nYesterday he asked where I would pick-up LO. I told him I would be in a certain part of town, and we could do it near there. I downloaded the parenting app today to try to limit his nonsense, and he signed up. All was civil. I gave him a time and place I would pick the child up tomorrow, near the area I mentioned, and at a place that was obvious to him and we both knew well, not to mention it was a place there is only one of in town. In the parenting app, he tried his stupid game. He acted like he didn't know of this place being at the specific crossroads I mentioned yesterday (in which I was just giving him a general area I was going to be in, clearly not saying we would meet there, because there is nowhere to meet there), so he wasn't sure where I meant but would definitely look into it. I guess he thought better of it a few minutes later and tried to play off being confused by correcting with \"or did you mean this place?\" Which was where I meant, but he referred to it as if I hadn't mentioned it at all and as if *I* was being cryptic. He obviously knew that was the place. So I told him, in the app, \"I know you know where I mean. When you acknowledge that we can finalize the place. If you don't want to do it there, you can suggest a different place.\" \n\n\nI then messaged the address of exactly where I meant, so kind of humored him, and I shouldn't have done that. I knew he would try to act confused and innocent and play off like I was biting his head off. Which is why I second guessed myself and texted the address. I sat here and wondered if I had reacted appropriately or if it really was a misunderstanding. And then I told myself, Fuck That! I am so over giving him the benefit of the doubt when I know he is fucking with me. For someone who can't manage to \"remember\" to respond to the correct email thread, or \"remember\" the thing I asked him about 3 minutes before (he did the same shit when we were together, multiple times a day), he is going to claim he \"remembers\" I mentioned this specific cross street yesterday and claim he thought I meant we would meet exactly there? No. He deserved to be called out and condescended to, and I'm not making any apologies for it. And I don't care what his response eventually is (I guess he's mad so isn't answering tonight, which is weird bc he usually answers right away playing like he was genuinely confused), because it's just going to be more lies and gaslighting anyway. And I also know after a little while of using this app he will \"forget\" the rules and not be able to resist plain-as-day gaslighting on it. He's already testing the waters after using it for half a day.\n\nI know this is super long. I'm venting bc I am mad at myself for still second guessing. Maybe I'm reacting exactly how he wants me to, idk. I am remaining as clinical and straightforward as possible, writing as though I am speaking to a small spoiled hateful child. Respectful, almost \"professional,\" not repeating myself multiple times because he wants to pretend he is dumb, and not falling for his temper tantrums or victim BS. For the most part I feel like I've succeeded, but there is still way too much contact and way too much of me trying to cover for his playing the good guy so he can't try to make me look bad. But now that the app is set up, the paperwork is mostly done, and the stuff is retrieved and settled, I only have to speak to him every other Friday and Sunday. It's more than I want, but it is what it is. And he will be so desperate for supply by then, hopefully his true cors show just like they have everywhere else in the past month. Right now, I just want my LO home, I hate that he has to be there at all, and I want to be able to ignore nEx's pathetic crap from there on out. \n\n\nI'm getting there.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I managed to force him off of me and ran to the bathroom. I waited till he was asleep took a few painkillers and a meletonin and knocked out. I woke up to him having sex with me acting like nothing happened he didn't ask if I wanted to amd he didn't ask me of I was ok. I know I should probably leave him but I'm scared he has never shown any violence towards my kids and this is the first time in 7 years that he's been abusive towards me.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

But basically for years I have been thinking that my parents were abusing me, but they're really good at lying and manipulating the truth - gaslighting. They rephrase things after I call them out on their behavior so that way I second guess myself and I guess I'm second guessing myself right now and I'm looking for someone to either tell me I'm right or I'm wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor context, at four years old I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome (for those of you who don't know it's a very high functioning form of Autism, basically it makes me struggle in social situations I'm not familiar with, makes me highly intelligent in very specific aspects of my life, and the complete opposite of OCD. It does affect me slightly different in my private life, like with my family, but is quite similar to any other aspect of autism, I have issues with overstimulation and if people are yelling while I'm already crying, and I start ticking my head then that means I'm about to have an emotional episode), as well as ADHD, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Now my parents claim they never put me on meds for the ADHD and anxiety because of my Asperger's but I'm not sure if I believe them on that. Now as an eighteen year old I have been diagnosed with depression and PTSD as well and am being treated for such. \n\nMy dad was in the military for a long time, most of my life actually (I've almost moved a dozen times since I was born), and retired when I turned 13 and we moved one last time to be near family for his new job. That was kinda when all hell broke loose. I had shown signs of depression in the past, but once we moved was kinda the final straw and I really began to struggle. I made it through eighth grade, graduating middle school, but after freshman year of high school, my life went down the drain. I had a very negative incident occur over the summer between 9th and 10th grade, causing me to cut out a lot of people from my life, and because of the intensity and the year being what it was, I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do in the aftermath, so for the whole first semester of 10th grade I distanced myself from any male friends I'd had, without explanation and only told two people what had happened to me. Then right after spring break, my closest relative passed away. This was also the year I came out as bisexual to my parents. My mom didn't care and my dad wasn't particularly happy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBecause I'm not 1,000% sure that what my parents are doing is abusive, I am going to use terms like \"feels like\" or \"I believe\" so that way I don't make a fool of myself since again, this is my first post on Reddit - ever. Now onto what has been happening for the past few years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a long time I've felt like my mom was pretty emotionally abusive. Not listening to me even when my counselors called her because I was suicidal, and not believing I was depressed. For a long time the only instances in which she actually claimed that she hated me were in heated arguments, and never did it occur to me that she might actually mean it. But everything pretty much went downhill my senior year of high school (I am now a freshman in college). From mid-October to late February I was dating my best guy friend at the time - we'll call him Scott so I don't give out his real name. Now everything was great, my dad was joking about how (we are very short people - I'm barely 5'2) he could totally beat him up if he hurt me even if my boyfriend was almost a foot taller than him, as he drove me to a double date with my boyfriend. But he started to make me uncomfortable and I didn't really think much on it. That was on a Thursday night. On the following Monday, my mother took me to school and said \"good to know Scott is a real person!\" as if they didn't believe anyone would want to date me. Now those are all little snide remarks, but about halfway through November came the \\*good\\* stuff. \n\nHe came over to my house to hang out with me and my family before he was going to take me out to dinner since he didn't have practice after school that day, and we were playing Clue with my little sister, we'll call her Caitlin. My mom had earlier made a big deal about me and Scott watching a movie in the guest room, even with the door open, so we'd settled on playing a decently competitive murder mystery game with my sister. About halfway through the game, I asked Scott what time he wanted to go for dinner, seeing as neither one of us were hungry yet. He told me whenever I got hungry to just tell him and we'd go. Towards the end of the game, my little little brother (I have two little brothers) we'll call him Noah, came over to me with a folded over sticky note. He told me it was from my mom. On the top of the folded part it said \"don't open/read til college\" I laughed, thinking it had to be a joke, seeing as I would totally lose the sticky note before then so it must have been meant to be read right then and there. At this point in time I was sitting facing Scott so he couldn't see my cards. I unfolded the sticky note to see if there was even anything written inside, and sure enough it read \"Thank God you're finally gone - Mom.\" I broke down sobbing and Scott got very confused and concerned, trying to hold me as I gave him the note. His eyes widened in shock and he whispered in my ear, asking if I wanted to go to my favorite comfort food place that was pretty close to the house. I nodded, and he helped me out of the house. No one really talked about it afterward. \n\nThat wasn't the only time that my mom said or did anything that might be considered emotionally abusive to me in front of Scott either. Over winter break, he spent a hell of a lot of time at my house, wanting to spend as much time together as we could. One day while we were working on a holiday puzzle at the dining room table, my mom proudly said that my oldest little brother, Evan, was the only kid that she'd purposefully gotten pregnant with, that Caitlin and Noah were happy accidents and I was a flat out mistake she never wanted. Scott froze up and gave me a \"what the actual fuck\" look and I just shrugged. \n\nNow a lot more happened without Scott there than with him there. More in regards to my dad. At the beginning of our relationship, my dad had decided it would be interesting to ask me to come downstairs and get mad at me. So he called me downstairs, and I asked him to give me a minute as I was moving clean laundry to my room to be folded. He didn't really respond so I assumed it was okay. I moved the laundry back to my room and when I went to leave to go see what he needed/wanted, he was storming down the hallway, fuming. I slowly backed into my room, after years of experience, knowing not to poke the already obviously poked bear. I remained calm and all of a sudden he had pushed me down on my bed - pinning me there with his body as I squirmed and sobbed begging him to get off me. I've been sexually assaulted before and he was aware of this. He told me he wouldn't get off until I stopped crying. It took me holding my breath and blacking out for him to get off. The next day I asked if he understood why what he did was triggering in a polite conversation. He responded with \"yea well maybe when you yell at us its triggering for us.\"\n\nI told Scott about this and he was pissed as all hell. There were a couple other times when he kept making fun of me for being sexually active with Scott when I actually wasn't because I didn't want to be without BC and I wasn't on BC yet. Then right after Scott and I broke up, we'd had a pretty heated argument. My phone was about to die so after the argument I plugged my phone in at my moms desk and sat down, texting my best friend. Finally when I knew my phone wasn't going to die, I got up and started to go to my room. I was in cognitive behavioral therapy as a kid so I was taught to leave the situation if I couldn't calm down the situation. But my dad a lot of times had issues with that. I did not think that was one of those cases. I have two hoddies I love, one is from Seal Beach, and the other is from the most recent Panic! At the Disco Tour concert. I was wearing my P!ATD hoodie and when I got up to leave, he grabbed my hood and dragged me out into the garage. We have a navy blue suburban car, and a baby car seat for Noah still on the left side of the car. Once in the garage, my dad yanked open the left door (not the driver's door tho, the one behind it where the baby car seat was), and just threw me. Hard enough my right hip just banged against the car seat and I nearly broke my fingers backwards trying to catch myself. My mom got in the middle of things luckily but I couldn't walk straight for a week. \n\nWhile we were traveling during spring break - and a lot of the time since then - my dad has berated and made fun of me for having a small appetite, which I developed after my assault when I was younger, along with anorexia and anemia. He even chose to joke about me to the waiter which stung, and after at the hotel I told him it hurt and he said it was funny.\n\nNow back to things about my mom before I get to the most recent shit.\n\nMy mom mostly just says things like \"I hate you\" and to \"get out of her house and her life\" a lot of the time, but one time right before graduation, we were arguing in the laundry room, and she slapped me hard enough across the face that my nose started gushing blood. The blood got in my mouth and on the washer as I blindly searched for tissues. I struggled to breathe with all the blood streaming into my mouth from my nose, and all of a sudden my mom just held a rag to my nose and yelled at me now that I could be quiet because a rag was over my mouth and nose. A week later, while we had family in town for graduation, she told me to clean up the blood. I said \"what blood?\" she said \"The blood from last week all over the washer, hahahaha.\" So yea. She made me clean up my own almost broken bloody nose blood she caused. \n\nThen after being put on PTSD medication, memories of them locking me in a closet, sometimes with food and light, other times, without either one, for even the most minor of misbehaviors from 7-12 years old, came back.\n\nMy parents have told me that by talking to friends about my family life I'm \"breaking the trust of the inner circle\" and that \"family comes first\" so I thought it was a good idea to share on a forum like this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR\n\nMy dad gets physical with me and my mom does too but is mostly all about telling me she never wanted me in her life, and I'm threatened to not tell friends about my family life. Side note, my dad made me sign a makeshift contract for CYFD saying I was safe in the house in case a friend reported them because at least one friend reports them every year since I was 14.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I never came to understand what happened until I was about 23 or so, I'm 34 now. When I was in kindergarten,  my grandmother would pick me up, bring me to my uncle's house until my parents got home from work. During these days my \"cousin\" (I say with quotations because he was a cousin through marriage) would invite me to his room to show me dirty pictures from porno mags. He manipulated me into thinking these women were real and wouldn't just go for anyone. He told me that I needed to practice. That practice involved me stripping down to my underwear and making me grind on top of him while he was naked. He came from a religious background and used that to manipulate me even more by saying bad things would happen if I didn't apologize to jesus every night and my parents would be just as angry if I told them. I was terrified. I didn't want bad things to happen to me or my family and the last thing I wanted at that age was for my parents to be mad at me. This went on until I went into 1st grade and took the bus home every day.\n\nUp until I hit my 20s and began drinking and experimenting with drugs, I hadn't even gave what happened to me a 2nd thought. Then something must have clicked and I realized just what it was that I had experienced. I eventually told my mother and father. They supported me, my dad explained he was abused as a child and he tried to make me understand it wasn't my fault. And I did. I knew it wasn't my fault. But I've always had issues with being truthful and upfront about things. I just assumed EVERYONE lied as much as I did. It was never incredibly important things that I was untruthful about, inconsequential,  every day fibs. Then, I started getting into more serious relationships and began to see where my past had begun interfering with my future. I lost girlfriends, lost friends and most importantly I lost sight of myself. \n\nAt 25 I was alone, my parents moved to another state, my sister was raising 2 kids and I lost touch with the rest of my family. I slumped into a terrible depression and eventually a bad drinking habit. I had a poor paying job that I worked at for 6 out of 7 days of the week. I maintained this life for another few years and was never truly happy, no one would be living how I was. And then, my mother passed away unexpectedly. My whole world came crashing down into itself and I lost my sense of reality. \n\nDepressed and lonely, I sought out attention and joined Tinder and met the mother of my child. We were together for almost 2 years before she became pregnant. We had separated prior to either of us finding out that she was pregnant but have been together since the birth of my daughter. To make a long story short,  I've done nothing right by her. I lack the maturity that I think most men of my age have. My lying has been a detriment to our relationship, I have grown to become extremely defensive, I've been on dating sites repeatedly for attention, addicted to porn and just have been a pretty terrible person off and on for the past 3 or 4 years. \n\nThis is not how I want to be. This is not the person that I want my child to grow up and find out was her father. I love my daughter and girlfriend immensely, more than words can begin to describe. I just have lacked the courage and strength to really fight these demons and put them behind me. Mental health isn't covered by my healthcare provider so I can't afford to see a therapist. However, as cliche as it might be, I started reading  \"Awaken The Giant Within\" by Tony Robbins. I've connected with it and can see the opportunities to change my way of life. However when my gf and I fight, which is pretty much always something that I created, I can't help but feel like it's not my fault. I feel like I wasn't dealt the same hand most people are growing up and I start to feel sorry for myself. I begin questioning every thing in life and why things are the way they are. Why am I so immature, why am I so defensive, why do I try to get away with being untruthful? These questions get to the point of redundancy and it angers me more that I can ponder all these things and still be left with the same result.\n\nI have a beautiful girlfriend and child that I want to enjoy the rest of my life with but I know if I can't get over these hurdles that have become ingrained in my behavior, I have no chance of ever fulfilling that dream. And I feel if I lose them then I can't imagine getting another chance after having so many. \n\nI apologize for the incoherent rant, I felt the need to get this off my chest after a pretty bad arguement with my girlfriend. I feel like at the core of it all, I'm a good person with issues I have yet to resolve. I just really want to be the best person for her and my daughter.\n\nAny and all help is appreciated.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

For the last few years I\u2019ve been struggling with my memories, specifically the ones I can\u2019t remember. I have doubts about many of the things my mother has told me about my life, but most of my childhood is fuzzy and the only relative I have that could clear things up, my maternal grandmother, is dead. \n\nSo, I want to get my court records. I know I was in CPS custody from ages 1-3 roughly, I was placed with different relatives, but most often my grandma. After that there were investigations every couple years, but I had already realized it was easier to lie to social workers than it was to tell the truth and inevitably get placed back with my mom. While I was in elementary school my father, his sisters, and my grandma all teamed up to try and get custody. I\u2019m pretty sure CPS was involved, but I can\u2019t remember exactly. I know that I told them a lot of truth, I remember sitting in a hotel and talking into a tape recorder. Obviously, that didn\u2019t work out either but I know that they tried. \n\nThe problem with getting the records is that I don\u2019t know where to start. There were so many cases over the years, and we moved around pretty frequently so I\u2019m not sure what county the records would be in. Has anyone else ever managed to get their hands on their CPS records, and if so what is the process like? I know my dads parents have all of them, but we\u2019re long estranged and they\u2019ve told me they would never let me read them anyway because it\u2019s \u201ctoo traumatic.\u201d \n\nWhile I know they\u2019ll be hard to read, the fact that I don\u2019t know if most of my childhood was real or just a memory fabricated by my abusive mother is too uncomfortable for me to sit with.

Even how he wants me to dress and be his perfect wife.\n\nHe\u2019s physically hit me and chocked me on 7 occasions and whenever I bring it up he always apologizes but then go on to say it\u2019s because I bumped him in the hallway one time or because he lost control. \n\nWhenever I try to leave him for good he always tell me that \u201cthis isn\u2019t the way, we have a family to take care\u201d or he\u2019ll try to kick me out the house saying, \u201csince I don\u2019t want to be with anymore I need to find another place to live so leave his house\u201d.

If I don\u2019t have sex with him he tends to start arguments the next day about it accusing me of having sex with someone else or having an STI.

He says I should always want to have sex with him because it\u2019s an activity that we can enjoy together all the time.\n\nHe gets mad when I use his hair products for my hair and I never ask for it and will have a full blow argument about it saying how I\u2019m always touching his things.

Its like they read some playbook on how to do abuse people for their entertainment. I watched them so that reality can LITERALLY sink in! \n\n2.) Realize that they've moved on! Narcs have been doing this game since way back and have put on a laundry list of people they've hurt. Red flags were occurring when the N was always fearful with seeing, meeting or dating anyone from his high school. Going back they've moved on and they are 5 steps ahead of us.  They've been talking to new supply and are searching for more. Once they've given you the cold stare, the barely there reply and giving you the bare minimum. I guarantee that they are ready to start playing some game. Games like gaslighting, lies and manipulation. Why? because they are ready to jump ship. You should as well! Trust me there have been MANY times I wonder what they are doing. But alas what they are doing is that THEY'VE MOVE ON. Trust that they won't shed a tear when you have new friends and found your other love because they've have done that earlier like MONTHS earlier than you did. \n\n3.) Block them from social media, throw away stuff they've given you and remove all traces of memories from them. The less you see, the less you hear and less you think, the more we can all move forward! Its hard I can't block my N friend just yet lol. But I've made sure to communicate less, threw the gifts and remove any pics that we had. \n\n4.) Time! Now I will tell you the sooner you accept reality THE BETTER things will be. I again reading and watch those youtube channel has made me accept it sooner than I've though it would. Accepting the reality and that I have a choice, difficult it may be at first but I know one day I will fully move on. They've changed us for sure. But that doesn't mean the world has to end for us.

You can read a bit about him in my post history. He was not physically abusive, but he was a deeply manipulative individual whose emotional abuse completely ground down my self-esteem. I broke up with him a bit more than two years ago. He tried to hoover a year later, but I resisted and blocked him everywhere. I went to a therapist, and I did lots of CBT exercises to help with self-esteem. I was recovering slowly, but surely. I know I am finished with the narc - not only would I never take him back, but I have reached a point where I feel completely detached from him: no nostalgia, no desire, just an awareness of how nasty, but also how pathetic he really is. I decided that, as I cannot go back and erase this experience from my life, I will at least try to learn from it, and I think I did. \n\nNow, I have never been very good at dating, and I am in fact quite inexperienced for my age. As my relationship with the narc was ending, I went on some dating sites for the first time in my life, as I thought it would help with separating myself from him. I know dating so soon after a narc relationship is not recommended, and I wouldn't recommend it now, but the truth is that it did help to some extent: it made me realise that there are some fairly normal single men out there and that there are options; it also distracted me a bit and helped clear the obsession the narc created in my head. Nothing ever came out of those dates, I just met them 1 or 2 times, we chatted a bit and that was it. I then stopped doing it, partly on the recommendation of the therapist, but also because I realised that this type of dating simply isn't for me: I can't connect with complete strangers within a few hours, and I can't decide whether I want to be in a relationship with them based on 1 or 2 meetings. I decided that, once I get better, I will try to meet people in the wild. This would require me to get over my usual shyness, but I thought I would try.\n\nA few months ago, it happened. I met my crush. I got to know him in a professional setting (we are not co-workers, so no problem in that regard), and after a few meetings it became clear that he is single. I decided to do something I had never done before, and asked him out for coffee. He agreed, and we started meeting up to chat over coffee or lunch. It wasn't obvious whether these are dates or just friendly meetings, but I enjoyed them and thought I'd see where it goes. Then he suggested we go to the theatre together. I agreed enthusiastically, of course, and we went. He drove us there, we had dinner before the performance, saw a really good play, and had some really enjoyable conversations. It was great. He really seems like a nice, normal, kind person - no narc-y red flags at all.\n\nSo what's wrong? It's me. This whole thing is giving me such terrible anxiety that it is distracting me from work, from my friends, from everything. Before the date, instead of feeling pleasant excitement, I felt anxiety and dread. I was 100% sure something was going to go wrong: he would cancel it, or make it clear he wasn't enjoying it, or he would never want to see me again afterwards. After the date, I am second guessing myself constantly. Was it even a date? After all, nothing physical happened. Maybe he changed his mind? And why didn't I flirt with him? I am really bad at flirting, and I am also very reserved and don't start very personal conversations easily - maybe that put him off? I have no proof he was put off - he said he would like to meet again, and we could go to the theatre again or meet for coffee, etc. What I'm realising is that I have no way of reasonably evaluating what actually happened, because my anxious reactions are anxious reactions I have preserved from the narc relationship. I am not reacting to what is happening now, I am reacting to what happened then. I remember the coldness and despair I felt sitting next to the Narc, when I wanted him to just cuddle me, and he never did - and then I feel despair that my present crush is not cuddling me, even though the reason for that is that we are just getting to know each other and haven't reached that stage. I panic that he will cancel the date because that's what the Narc would have done. I can't judge whether it was really a date or not, because I don't have any normal dates to compare it to. Sad but true: I'm in my late thirties, and this was the best date anyone has ever taken me on, and I cannot even tell whether it was a date.\n\nI know some of you will say that I should just abandon dating again, and maybe that's good advice. But I don't want to do that for two reasons: 1) He is great, and I don't want to throw away this chance. 2) I feel like I have done all I could in terms of self-healing - on paper. I have to face real life now. So please, those of you who have moved on successfully after a Narc relationship and found someone new - how did you deal with these issues? And those of you who are struggling with them now: can we find a way to rationalise these anxieties and make ourselves aware that they relate to the past, and not the present?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don\u2019t even know where I\u2019m going with this post tbh. Sorry if it doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nWhen I was 13-14ish (can\u2019t remember the exact age even though it was less than 5 years ago) my mom was working night shift. My stepdad and I were pretty close but basically we would watch shows. I would get tired and lay down, he would be behind me. and he would touch me inappropriately on my chest. I would pretend to fall asleep because I didn\u2019t want him to know that I knew. This only happened about five times and not for longer than two months.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to call this. It\u2019s not rape, but I feel like it\u2019s weird to called it molestation, and I feel like it\u2019s more than groping. I know that it\u2019s not even that bad compared to other people, but it still has taken a mental toll on me. I know that assigning a title seems dumb, but I just feel like it would help me ground it a bit more so I can just accept it and move on.\n\nThere were some accusations made recently against my stepdad by his ex-wife about him acting inappropriately with my niece (toddler), and later more accusations about him doing the same to his children (all adults now) when they were younger. I know these accusations are false, though. If I had any suspicion that they were real, I would say something because then his actions wouldn\u2019t only be affecting me. It was really hard, however going through that because I had to talk to a CPS agent and tell him how my stepdad wouldn\u2019t do anything like that, and I had to listen to my mom saying that my stepdad could never do anything like that.\n\nSometimes my stepdad will still make comments that make me uncomfortable. He\u2019ll comment on what I wear, saying that I look good, that I make it look good, or that I have a good figure. Even if it\u2019s an innocent comment, knowing what I know makes my stomach drop, and I hate whenever he hugs me or touches my shoulder.\n\nI can\u2019t ever take action, for obvious reasons. It would make my mom financially unstable, and it would break her. It would affect his relationship with his kids. It would screw over his business and employees. It just sucks because in a twisted way, I still love and appreciate him as my stepdad because he still supports me and my family. My dad is kind of a POS who left me and my siblings for a new family, so my stepdad is my \u201cfather figure.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also bad because I\u2019m taking a psychology class and we\u2019re talking about reconstructed memories, which made me worry that I\u2019m just imagining that all this happened, but I remember it very vividly sometimes. I know in my heart that what I know is true, but it scares me that it could be invalidated.\n\nThis incident also affects my relationship sometimes, like if my boyfriend is touching me in that area (consensually) or even just taking off my bra. It not all the time, but sometimes it just reminds me of when that used to happen. My boyfriend is very understanding though, and he stops when I tell him.\n\nI never told anyone except, recently, my boyfriend. Once I go to college (soon) I will likely seek therapy, but I can\u2019t do that now because my mom still doesn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t plan on telling her, so please don\u2019t make me feel bad for not saying anything.\n\nThat\u2019s it, I guess. Sorry that it was in no logical progression.

My ex (23F) left me (24F) for someone else back in June. I was devastated, and desperate to get her back. We were together for 4 years and best friends beforehand. She wanted to remain best friends, but I declined because it was too painful and went to NC in August. \n\nNC lasted 3 weeks, before she reached out asking if she could take me out on a date. Apparently she had dumped the other girl days earlier, and for the next couple of days she showered me with compliments, \u2018nobody makes me feel like you do, we\u2019re soul mates, I want a future together\u2019. \n\nThe following day she went ice cold, telling me how much she missed the other girl and wanted to be single at the moment, she said she needed time as thing were moving too fast. She proceeded to ignore me for 2 weeks, leaving me with no idea what was going on. \n\nOne day we bumped into each other (we live 5 mins apart) and I asked her what was going on. She didn\u2019t really answer, and a little while later she messaged me to say she was back together with the other girl, and only missed me as a friend. She was quite spiteful, giving me grief for going to NC, and even telling me she hadn\u2019t mucked me about. There was no apology, no remorse. She ignored my message, and this lasted for about a week. \n\nI then got a big long message on Monday night from her telling me how sorry she was, how she wanted to see me and sort this whole thing out, she asked for one more chance.  I was very very cautious and so didn\u2019t agree to anything, but we started talking again causally. \n\nMy ex told me she was annoyed at the fact I didn\u2019t want to be friends with her, and that the only way for her to be in my life was a relationship. I told her this wasn\u2019t the case, and that we should just get back to being civil and slowly start talking again.  I said we should just give it a try and see how things go or if something develops. If things don\u2019t work out, we could still be friends. \n\nShe told me she didn\u2019t have any feelings for me in that way, (which confused me) but would give it a chance. \n\nThe last few days she has been so blunt with me it\u2019s insane, waiting 3-4 hours between each message, barely saying anything or making any effort. I feel she is being sneaky, and thinking talking to me like this could be classed as \u2018trying\u2019 which obviously it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s like she is forcing herself not to feel anything, it\u2019s very fake. To be honest I would rather just be friends and see how things go, which I\u2019ve told her, so there\u2019s no pressure coming from me. \n\nI can\u2019t understand her motives, because I told her the convo at the minute is so bad I wouldn\u2019t even stick around as a friend. It doesn\u2019t benefit her in anyway, so why do it? Please someone explain! We\u2019re supposed to be meeting up on Tuesday. \n\nTL;DR.

Advice on Leaving?", "author": "isitrealorisitfake", "self_text": "There is a lot more I could touch on but I'm exhausted. I have issues myself. I am codependent and sometimes get too angry or frustrated. Going to bullet point a few things and see if people think this is narcissism. Something is definitely wrong but I'm on the fence between whether its avoidant attachment or covert Narcissism. Any advice is much appreciated. You can view my post history for more in-depth details.\n\n\\-She has told me her family would make fun of her when she was a child for her weight (now she is very thin and looks like a model). Her mother would give her brothers more affection than her. Also has told me her dad didn't give her much attention. Hasn't mentioned abuse, but when I asked once in an argument if she was abused as a child she didn't respond.\n\n\\-She doesn't empathize when I express my feelings to her, usually ignores it. Often during a deep conversation or argument, she will pull out her phone or tell me she doesn't want to talk.\n\n\\-When we first met she climbed into bed naked and we had sex, it felt very consensual and we spent three days straight with each other after and she seemed madly in love with me. 6 months later she said she felt like I violated her and rushed sex.\n\n\\-We live on my family's land (i raise animals here and caretake the land) and she is very threatened by my mother  who owns the land whenever she is around. Sees my mother as very controlling (she is somewhat controlling but has been trying very hard to stay out of our hair because she recognizes how sensitive my gf is to her). As a result, my mother feels hurt and not welcome.\n\n\\-Constantly begged to get a place that wasn't family land, and my mother said it is what she wants to. So I find an apartment which gf says she likes, and that if we are separating that I should please get the apartment. I get the apartment, front the costs, sign the lease, and now she is saying she thinks the apartment is a bad Idea. I had verbally confirmed with her that she likes it and that even if things don't work out she is willing to live there, but now she is saying she doesn't, now that the lease is signed.\n\n\\-Sister in law invited her to be a maid of honor at their wedding, sent an email about it. Gf never responded to the email, now does not want to participate but doesn't feel obligated to communicate about this decision to sister in law. \n\n\\-Mother tried to tell us about sister in law visiting with one-week advance warning, this triggered my girlfriend into what felt like an extended rage. Agreed with gf about it being short notice but she took a lot out on me, saying I was no independent because we live on family land (I've been financially supporting gf for two years). Threatened to poison my mother, called me a little bitch, my mother a bitch, my brother a bitch.\n\n\\-Blocked sister in law on Instagram, because she was upset about the visit and that sister in law, and didn't contact us herself (my mother contacted us about it which I admit was a bit odd). Grinned about \"sending a message\" by blocking her. I messaged sister in law to explain, and made the mistake of saying, \"I think maybe she is threatened by you because you are marrying my brother\".  Eventually forced me to show the text messages and said it is more hurtful and more of a betrayal than if I had sex with someone else.\n\n\\-Had a Christmas visit with family and gf constantly complained about family and said they visiste for too long, stayed withdrawn for much of the time. Family noticed and was hurt by it. Her response to that is that my family is too needy etc.\n\n\\-After above event, she became very cruel, snapped at me in the store, said the only reason I was there was to pay for the groceries. Birthday rolls around, she asks why I seem upset, I tell her because she treated me like shit. This caused her to shut down and not spent my birthday with me. We were planning to spend time at the beach but she said I was forcing the plans down her throat, that she already had plans to make a cake and I was changing plans. It was my birthday and we planned the beach...it was like she forgot we had the plan.\n\n\\-Said she has suicidal thoughts\n\n\\-Very low intimacy, kisses are always pecks, affection is very rare, sex is very rare. I've given up on trying to initiate sex because she always turns it down. Sex is when she wants it, maybe once every couple of weeks.\n\n\\-Very image-obsessed, always asking what I think of outfits. Recently changed into an outfit and said, \"I look like a runway model\". Once a homeless person whistled at her and said she was sexy and her response was, \"thanks\".\n\n\\-Fantasizes about sex with other people and has asked for threesomes. Granted I also had those fantasies but it was when there was more affection and I felt closer to her.  When sex was casual it was frequent, as the relationship deepened it became infrequent and I am \"sex-obsessed\" or manipulative for wanting it.\n\n\\-No touching, hugging, or kissing when he gets home or when she leaves, despite my communicating to her dozens of times that this is important to me.\n\nSo now my plan is to move into the new apartment with her and if I don't see an improvement I will leave. If she doesnt want to stay there I will take the lease and stay there myself. Not sure what else to do. Does anyone have advice on leaving this sort of relationship? She finally agreed to therapy as I was breaking up with her, but I am afraid to keep drawing this out.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

They will step in and help you, without expecting anything in return. They tend to believe in the goodness of others, and in reciprocity in relationships. They also tend to have good hearts.\n\nYou step in and help a person because you think you're doing the right thing. You genuinely want to help. And somewhere in your mind, you believe that they'd do the same thing for you if you were in a pinch. You have no problem giving of yourself because you think that, of course, this person would give back to you.\n\nThe thing is, with a narcissist, they wouldn't. They have no intention of ever giving you anything. What they are getting out of your inclination to fix and help is FUEL. They're thinking, \"Look at this foolish person running around for me. I'm so special, I'm so important. I have this person wrapped around my finger, they'll do anything for me. Look at them give, give, and give some more. I wonder how much I can get out of them?\"\n\nThis mindset, of course, is totally foreign to normal, healthy people. When someone does something for us, we're grateful for it. And, we also don't *need* people to run around doing things for us. We don't seek this out. If we're offered something, we'll take it and be thankful for it, but on the whole we're self-sustaining, and we certainly wouldn't use and abuse a person who's giving to us.\n\nNarcissists have zero problem using and abusing someone who's giving to them. They are so empty and so self-entitled that whatever you give, they will take it and then manipulate you to give them more so they can take more. There's no end to it. They will never be grateful towards you and they will never give back to you what you've given them. They will just suck you into their bottomless pit of \"more\".

Get a drink, maybe a snack and buckle up while you read my extremely fucked up family history. \n\nMy entire family is toxic and a lot of us have moderate to severe mental illnesses, it\u2019s a wonder that social services haven\u2019t intervened. My younger brothers (13 &amp; 14) are both heavy stoners who steal to support their habit. I recently had my Xbox One stolen just so they could get high. My very emotionally manipulative mother is too spineless to discipline them in any way shape or form so she instead uses me as an emotional punching bag, she will find literally any reason to make me feel like I\u2019m worthless. When I told her about my Xbox being stolen, rather than trying to comfort me and make me feel better about the situation she instead decided to lecture me about how it was my fault for leaving valuables in the house. When I threatened my brothers by telling them that I\u2019d get the police involved, my mother became furious with me because I was \u201cstressing her out\u201d and that \u201cshe couldn\u2019t take it\u201d.  To most people this is already a seriously fucked up situation already, but this isn\u2019t even the worst part. My mother straight up told me that if I didn\u2019t like it, that I should move out of the house and live with my biological dad (I would if it wouldn\u2019t wreck my education, I\u2019m currently learning to become a hairdresser and it just isn\u2019t possible for me to transfer to a different college for a myriad of reasons.)  Anyway, back to the story. My mother refuses to do anything about it and I have to buy a replacement Xbox out of my own money because she won\u2019t take the money my brothers would have gotten for Xmas away to reimburse me. So they\u2019re getting away Scot free whilst I\u2019m left to pick up the pieces. \n\nDuring a holiday to Devon with my family in the summer of 2016 my 14 year old brother physically assaulted me numerous times and even threatened to kill me, the worst incident was when he threw a knife (a dull af butter knife) at me so hard and so fast that it sliced the side of my thigh open. I had to limp to the first aid woman at the front desk of the resort wearing blood stained pyjama bottoms. A few hours later my mother and stepfather became angry with me because i didn\u2019t want to forgive him for scarring me both physically and emotionally. \n\nWhen I was 14 years old my mother shouted at me so much that I burst into tears because I had recently put on a significant amount of weight due to the fact that I was being bullied to the point that I was planning my own suicide. I now am so terrified of gaining weight that I smoke instead of having breakfast and lunch. \n\nWhen I was younger than 10 my mother used to regularly slap me for behaviour that was a completely natural reaction to the toxic environment I was in. She once put me in a corner and slapped me across both sides of my face with both of her hands because I had accidentally repeated a swear word I\u2019d heard her use. \n\nThis summer, when I politely asked my 13 year old brother to turn down his blaring music that you could have heard from outside the house. He said (screamed)  \u201cShut the fuck up you fat piece of shit or I will fucking kill you!\u201d He then ran downstairs to find the biggest sharpest knife he could find but when he realised that my mother had hidden them (her one good deed) he instead tried to attack me in the living room. I had to fight him off and it was possibly the most terrifying thing I\u2019d seen in my life. The hate in his eyes was fucking scary. It was like looking at a wild animal. He\u2019s only 13 btw, so this is only going to get worse. When I called my mother to come and get me she was annoyed with me for making her leave my little sisters sports day, when she came to the house to collect me she lectured me instead of giving me any sort of sympathy. So after I had just been assaulted I was then made to feel ashamed for having done something sensible. \n\nLast November my stepfather attempted to assault me and the only reason I didn\u2019t was because my bedroom door had a lock on it. I\u2019m fully convinced he would have strangled me that night. \n\nMy brothers regularly steal from me, they put my Air Pods on the Shpock app \u201cas a joke\u201d. The list of things they\u2019ve stolen from me over the years is too long to ever write down. But I will give a few examples\n*Cigarettes \n*Money (they stole money from me so regularly that I never carry cash) \n*My Debit Card\n*My AirPods \n*My Curling Iron\n*My Xbox One S\n*Various Video Games\n*Various Items of Clothing\n* An Xbox 360 Controller\n*My School Supplies (thanks to them I had to steal pens at school) \n*My Laptop \n*My iPhone Charger \n\nMy mother is the queen of gaslighting, whenever she victimises me she always finds a way to make me feel guilty and that I\u2019m the one in the wrong even though I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. This week I asked her for a lift to college because it\u2019s a 45 minute walk for me but it\u2019s only a ten minute drive. I only asked her because it was half term for my little sister so she didn\u2019t have to drop my sister off at school. She then spent ten minutes making me feel horrible for even thinking to ask for a lift and that I was a lazy person and that I\u2019m selfish for wanting her help. I burst into tears when I arrived at college and was so distraught that I was unable to do my mock maths exam and had to take it a different day. \n\nI\u2019ve always been emotionally neglected by my mother and stepfather because I\u2019m the only child with a different father. She always says that it isn\u2019t true but I get such different treatment from my parents to the rest of my siblings that it\u2019s impossible for me to think differently. My parents have never made me feel like a part of the family, I feel like an outsider in my own house and I wonder what the hell is going to happen next. \n\nI loaned my parents over a grand and they have yet to pay me back, in fact when they sold their car they didn\u2019t pay me back they bought themselves new furniture for their bedroom. When I asked them why they couldn\u2019t pay me back they gave me bullshit excuses about how money is tight even though they regularly spend money on useless shit. \n\nI also have a mental illness that makes me severely depressed at times so when I was extremely depressed to the point where I would only leave my room to use the toilet and I didn\u2019t leave the house for an entire week, my mother didn\u2019t check on me once. I asked her if she could take me to the doctor because i was struggling with suicidal thoughts and she became extremely annoyed at me for inconveniencing her.  \n\nAnyway I\u2019m tired now so I\u2019m going to end the post here.

Long story short, after months of no contact, I've since decided it's best for my happiness at work if we can try to be civil and friendly again. And it's been great for about two months. He seems to be working on many of his issues, he's been treating me and others respectfully, he's been more involved in the \"community\" we have amongst our team, and even seems to have found companionship outside of work. Gradually we became friends again, sharing ideas, tv/movie suggestions, discussing hobbies, etc. \n\nBut just the other day, in a private chat, he started up the subtle negging again. Implying that an event I was planning would be a disaster, implying I was too dumb to figure out how to view something on social media... very subtle things that can be brushed off as playful joking. But they made my stomach sink. Especially the moment he implied that I would be incompetent at something, I gave him a competent answer, and he gave me \"praise\". Telling me that I did well and deserved a cookie. I felt like I was at the top of a slide, about to fall all the way to the bottom again.\n\nShould I confront him about this? I can tell his ego is extremely fragile, so I want to be delicate and I want to remain supportive of him. He seemed to be doing so well, and I want to encourage his continued growth. I know how much the support of my friends and loved ones has helped me grow, and I want to be able to provide that to someone else who so obviously needs it. But I know that I need to be firm about my boundaries if I'm going to keep from feeling completely insane again. \n\nI want to gently state that I need him to stop with the silly put downs because they affect me in ways I don't like, but I don't want to imply that he does this on purpose.. because I don't think he's actually malicious.

It's not short, but there is a tldr at the bottom fwiw. \n\n\nI recently left a covert narcissist I was with for 6 years. He gaslighted me, was verbally and emotionally abusive to my teenager (not his) and my toddler (his), among other things. I've talked a lot about this in the narc abuse sub. \n\n\nI opened up to friends and family about everything and left. I have nothing... no job, no money, no vehicle or driver's license... nothing but my kids and the knowledge I did what was best for them. Or I thought I did. Because I moved in with family. I've been isolated for 6 years, had no friends and nowhere else to go. I was supposed to be here very short term (like 2 weeks tops) while another place was in the works that my family was taking care of. I've been here over a month now with almost zero progress on the other place. Me nor my children have slept in a bed the whole month. It's a small space and it can easily get hectic, but for the most part there are no problems, no bickering or frustration. Everyone knows the situation I was in and we all try to help each other out and not get in each other's way. But then... there's Pat.\n\n\nOne family member, I'll call them Pat, has never been very well adjusted and has pretty much been catered to by everyone else in the family. Pat has some serious issues and is verabally and emotionally abusive to the rest of the family. After a month of being here, Pat is beginning to subject me and my children to the same verbal abuse and \"walking on eggshells\" that we just left. Now I knew Pat was like this and that it would inevitably begin, but I also was told this would be for a week or so, so I thought I could avoid it. Side note: Pat controls the progress on the other place. I literally can't do anything until Pat finishes their part.\n\n\nJust over the past 5 days, Pat has started verbally abusing my children, screaming at them for insignificant things bc they are children so an inconvenience to Pat. Having blow-ups and meltdowns at their expense. Which puts me in the position AGAIN of having to tell my children to tread lightly and try not to upset Pat. Which is impossible, bc just like the narc I left, Pat can lose it over anything at any time. There are examples that get into specifics, and it hasn't become extreme yet, but it is getting worse by the day, as Pat realizes they aren't getting the desired response from me, since I've learned not to react after 6 years of this.\n\n\nWhy put up with it? Why not say something like an adult? Bc everyone else in the family literally watches this take place, deals with Pat treating them like shit too, and just shrugs it off as if, \"That's just Pat. Let them blow off steam,\" like it's not abusive as fuck. This is not petty bickering. This is out of nowhere full on blow ups over anything whatsoever Pat feels like screaming at us about, with no acknowledgement afterward that it even happened and *never* any apology. If I say anything, no matter how respectfully or tactfully, no matter whether it's in the moment or once everything has cooled down, Pat will lose it, everyone else in the family will take Pat's side because I \"should have known better\" than to say anything at all bc poor old Pat just can't help it, and I'm booted out the door. It's happened before, and no matter what, I am *always* in the wrong. (I should stress here that there is absolutely nothing seriously wrong with Pat that would justify any of this, like a disability or traumatic brain injury or anything like that. Pat is a perfectly healthy and capable adult.)\n\n\nI just left 6 years of this. Pat has tested resistance and is ramping up. With me not reacting, Pat can keep behaving like this and creating chaos and gleefully witnessing the aftermath, never having to take any responsibility for it. It took 3 weeks for this to reach this point. 3 weeks of petty blow-ups *not* directed at my children and constant passive-aggressive remarks and looks and sighs and condescending comments made toward me, and then them. It took 3 weeks to get to full on verbal abuse, with my teen having panic attacks and me still having to tell her to walk on eggshells, while Pat makes my toddler feel like toddler's very existence is just wrong.\n\n\nI don't necessarily have a purpose for this post. I literally have *nobody* to talk to about this. And it is one of the worst feelings in the world - feeling so good about myself and the strength I had to leave the first situation, just to realize that I ended up in almost the same fucking situation, with *really* nowhere to go now, empty promises of \"you can have your own place soon,\" and \"No, Pat is different. Just let it blow over, *Pat* will be fine.\" With no end in sight. It makes me angry at myself for falling for it. For believing it would be different. For believing anyone actually gave a damn about what I went through and would try to be supportive rather than inviting me here and treating me like nothing more than an inconvenience.\n\n\nPat sees there is no pushback, they will go all in while the rest of the family sits idly by, waiting for their chance to blame me and get rid of me. I don't plan on giving them the satisfaction of blaming me for anything, but I also cannot believe I am expected to tolerate this, as if nobody here recognizes it's the same fucking abuse I left. I have nobody to talk to, nobody that can actually help, and nowhere else to go. All while just having to keep my head down and walk on eggshells, same as it ever was.\n\n\ntldr: left r'ship of 6 years with narcissist who was verbally abusive to me and my children, along with other types of abuse. Was invited to move in with family. Was told it would be very temporary and they were setting up my own place. After a month and no progress on that promise, one family member is beginning to verbally abuse me and my children again. I am angry, I have nowhere to go, zero resources, nobody to talk to after being isolated for years, and absolutely no way of handling this or even broaching the subject with another family member without it becoming my fault and being told to leave.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I like myself (or rather I did until him and I\u2019m learning how to love myself and return to my good nature instead of being a skeptical, jaded, mess). \n\nA lot of the things that I already have in life, he would talk about us having those things together, how lovely the future would be, but he was absolutely broke (made good money but was always broke) and I had to fund everything we did, save for one breakfast meal and once a coffee, over 6 months. I realized he had nothing to offer me at all and it was more like he was just coveting my life...I don\u2019t know if that makes sense. He acted like all that I had was what he aspired to. He made Pinterest boards for us, for a forever home that we would have, but he didn\u2019t have a dime to contribute to it. I could never even tell if he was embarrassed about always needing me to cover the bill. We didn\u2019t share expenses at least. In the end, he did pay me for something he owed me for. It was several hundred dollars, I tried to see it as a good thing, but it was also part of a Hoover. I was NC and he found a way that I forgot to block to contact me to say he sent a package, he sent me the tracking #, and then a package with my things, a gift, and cash he owed me with a tracking number, then he called me two days later from a blocked number heavy breathing and moaning (I think of it as a fake crying). I didn\u2019t react or respond. He said he wanted to know if the package arrived, he knew. I said it did, to take care, and hung up. He owed me that money and had promised to send it since the end of August and that finally prompted him. He told me he was waiting for a gift to arrive to include with it and sorry it took so long. Never mentioned sending it unless I brought it up otherwise. \n\nHe would triangulate me with another supply and put me down in other ways, but he never yelled at me or called me names, he would just go into hardcore sweet talk before he discarded me. He would act as if it were the end to a tragic love story and speak in prose. It was almost comical except it was confusing and hurt like hell at the same time. \n\nI had so many moments where I wasn\u2019t sure if I was even in the situation, he seemed so so into his own thoughts and ideas about it. And for all the love he professed, he never acted lovingly really, he always seemed wildly selfish to me, even in the good times. \n\nGoodness I hate him. I really do and it feels good to say that. I hope one day I can say I don\u2019t care, but I\u2019m happy to hate him instead of miss him. Right now I am trying to be kind to myself, I saw so many burning red flags and just kept on going!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I haven\u2019t seen or spoke to the first narc I dated in 3 years, but I do still have ptsd from him. \n\nMy recent nex, had got abusive first about a year ago and I feel like I\u2019ve constantly been in fight or flight mode while with him. He would trigger me a lot, even outside of arguments. I would dissociate if he did or said something similar to my ex narc. \n\nIn the past I was always the one to apologize in the relationship with my first narc. And even the relationship with another ex (non narc) before my most recent ex because I was absolutely horrible going through ptsd. I got into that relationship right after the first narc I dated. I didn\u2019t let myself heal and I also didn\u2019t realize I had ptsd at the time. My first narc was very verbally and physically abusive. I feel like I have picked up his traits, but I also know don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m a narc in general. My recent ex who I just left 2 weeks ago said I was the one who brought violence into the relationship and the abuse was 50/50. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m abusive, but when he was verbally abusing me, I hit him with my shirt. When he would lie to me I would yell and call him an idiot. When he would grab my belongings or try to take my keys to take his key off of them, I would react. Does that make me a narc too?\n\nBut overall he messed up a lot and I didn\u2019t apologize much in this relationship. My recent nex was very emotionally insecure, obsessive toward me and constantly wanted all my attention. So I was the more distant one at times. I told him it made me uncomfortable or at times I\u2019d tell him I want to take it slow. Like a few months ago I left him because he made a scene at a bar and yelled in my face while I was driving. 2 months later he tried to get me back, therefore was apologetic and I was the one who laid out expectations and boundaries. So in the end, he would make me feel like I didn\u2019t love him enough because he would say things like I talked to my ex so I was the one who disrespected him and ruined our relationship.

I don't know what to do", "author": "RocksandLove", "self_text": "Hi \n\nI don't know what to do with this information and I'm hoping that posting it here will help me. \n\nI (26F) have only recently realised that I was sexually abused by my older brother when I was 9-12 ish years old, and he was 12-15 years old. \n\nWe had a normal childhood and our parents were kind, loving, strict where necessary. I was never abused by them. We perhaps argued more than other families. We were all strong personalities. If we misbehaved as children we received maybe a light smack on the bum, but nothing more severe than that (very normal for my generation). \n\nThere was a family with a boy the same age as my brother, and a girl a year older than me. The parents were good friends with mine, and we often went on holidays together. \n\nI remember some time between the ages of 9 and 12(?), while our parents were happily having a wine or 2 (genuinely just having a drink, no abuse involved), on various holidays, we would play 'games' in secret with the other kids, including me and the other girl being told to lick and touch my brother and the other boy, and me and the other girl showing our private parts to them.\n\nI know that to my knowledge, this also happened at least once at home with just my brother.\n\nAt the time I didn't understand what was happening, and to my knowledge I went along with it. I can't even remember how old they or I were. I don't know who instigated it, but I know that it wasn't me. I was younger than all of them. I don't know if more happened - I don't feel like anything traumatic really happened.\n\nI have realised that it was very wrong of my brother and the other boy to do that. Nothing has happened since then, and I have a good relationship with my brother. I am now incredibly confused. Was he old enough to know what he was doing was wrong? Did he start it? Why did he start it? He is a genuinely kind person who would never let anyone hurt me or anyone in our family. I have read that children who perform this sort of abuse usually have experienced it themselves. While I am feeling some sort of delayed anger towards him, I do feel that he was only a child himself when this happened, and am worried that he experienced something worse. \n\nI can't tell anyone. I can't break my parents hearts. I don't know if I was the only person he abused. I just don't know what to do.

I was too scared to walk into uni and see his face and any time I would brave it and go in, he would say horrible things to me and make fun of me and my friends would pass it off as banter because unfortunately, he was a part of my immediate friend group. As the year went on I eventually opened up to a couple of people, they helped me get \u201chelp\u201d and talk to the uni about the incident; they suggested I leave for a year so I could \u201cget better\u201d when really they just didn\u2019t want to deal with the consequences because that boy was top of the class and course rep and I was practically failing. I managed to pass the year and he failed because he ended up with kidney failure and was on chemo in the last few weeks during a crucial project and he\u2019s no longer on our course. Over the summer, I worked a lot, gained a lot of independence and felt incredible coming back to uni and was ready to be the student I wanted to be and feel confident doing it because he wouldn\u2019t be there.. then I realised that he might be.

A boy that I had been friends with for 3 years said that he loved me, wanted to be with me and take care of me and I went for it... because all I wanted was someone to hold me and make me feel loved and wanted, as I didn't feel it at home or anywhere else.  Instead,  it became the worst decision of my life.  I had been molested in the past, many times but this was different.  I was abused by my boyfriend, mentally, physically and sexually.  He convinced me that as his girlfriend,  it was my job to give him whatever he wanted sexually.  After many times of saying no,  he molested me.  He had fantasies of raping me and one time, came close, he would have had my friend not walked in.  We were together for 3 months,   with emotional abuse happening daily.  I was convinced that I was crazy, he told me that my friends were against me and I couldn't trust anyone, he cussed me out because I was talking to someone that was telling me that he was no good.  One day,  I bashed my head into our granite counter tops because ( I was dumb and didn't understand how everything works)  I wanted to get away from my boyfriend and I wound up causing a neurological disorder which has me in constant pain and caused anxiety issues.  On top of that, I attempted suicide 7 times that year. My parents found out and split us up, so I havent had contact with him in almost 3 years and my past doesn't really bother me anymore.  I am in a great relationship now  with an amazing man and he has been helping me through it, however, sometimes, I get scared and project my past onto this relationship, which I know is very bad to do but my boyfriend is understanding and helps with it (I am getting better).  I guess the thing that I am wondering about, is for the past 3 years,  I have had the same nightmare about my ex (since while we were still dating) EVERY single Thursday night/ Friday morning,  because Friday was the day I would see him every week.. and I would spend Thursday freaking out, unsure what he would do next... but why haven't they gone away??

My narc blocked me off snapchat yesterday which was a relief actually because I have been wanting to for a long time but found it very hard to follow through with it. This was the only form of communication that we still had with each other. This was after I didn\u2019t give him a reaction that he wanted me to but he unblocked me off text message (I have already blocked him on Instagram) and I find it very strange for him to block me one place but unblock me another place. He has other cellphones which is why I didn\u2019t block his main cell because I know he will find an alternative means of spying on me or reaching me IF he wants to. I just am not sure if he\u2019s going to reach out again because he\u2019s moving an hour away in two weeks and I\u2019m not as easily accessible to him as I was before and I\u2019m pretty sure he has new supply already. He\u2019s said some bizzare things though that make me think he may be back one day like \u201c you\u2019re mine forever\u201d and an even scarier one that I never thought I would hear someone say \u201cyou\u2019re soul is mine forever\u201d and sorry for the foul language but \u201c I want to fuck you forever\u201d.  I\u2019ve told him in the past I love him very much and I\u2019ll always be there for him when he needs me so I may have mistakenly put it in his head that he can come backs whenever he wants to. Does this sound like I\u2019ve heard the last of him? I really hope I dont hear from him again because it\u2019s not good for my mental health to always hear from him. I\u2019ve not messaged him since the blocking and I\u2019ve sent one text to his cell this morning to see if I\u2019m still blocked there because I had this feeling I wasn\u2019t. He has not answered that message though and I don\u2019t feel like he will any time soon. I\u2019m finding it really hard to move on and am hoping he doesn\u2019t message me so I can forget about him and have a healthy relationship with someone who really loves me back. I know I need to block his cell and I will eventually once I am emotionally strong enough and I plan on going to therapy very soon, I am also waiting to see a councillor at my school.  I also want to say thank you guys so much, this subreddit has really helped me understand what has happened to me and all the support for each other really warms my heart.

So, I'll dance a bit more for you like the anxious little monkey that I am.\n\nI took healing as a full-time job once I realized NexW was eating me alive. I was posting on this sub almost daily. I was updating my therapist. I was making headway at a surprising pace. I hit rock bottom fairly quickly and chose to pick myself up. I started writing a book on my experiences and actually finished it recently, to my surprise. I went out on several dates, some going better than others. Had FWB situation pop up pretty naturally and end just as naturally; we are still on great terms and contact one another semi-regularly. I had a satanist kiss me in my jeep after she got done singing her favorite Taylor Swift song. I made hanging out with my friends a big priority, even when I was depressed and exhausted. I actually started going to these cool silent disco things on an almost weekly basis, which is a huge surprise for me. I'm also kind of casually chatting with a girl from Michigan who hasn't blinked twice about me being in my 20's and divorced.\n\nSo, you're caught up, and how am I now? I got no clue. This post is more for me to organize my thoughts and provide a platform for other people to share, I guess. For months I had clear objectives: get physically away from the narc, get a divorce, get my money in order, organize my thoughts and feelings by adding to the book, and start thinning out the gaslight. I did all that, and now I feel directionless. I know there isn't terribly much to do at this point, but it feels so strange getting to a point where I don't have a ton on my plate to keep my mind and body occupied. Now, what is left? Loneliness and the harsh realities of my C-PTSD.\n\nNow that the drama of the divorce process is over and done with, I'm plagued by vague nightmares on a nightly basis, waking up to find that I can't remember the slightest detail of them. There are other symptoms of C-PTSD, but it is all stuff you could guess at. Today, mere hours prior to this posting, I accidentally stumbled upon an old photo of my NexW that had somehow slipped through the cracks when I had purged my phone of all evidence of her existence. Her contact information was changed to \"Satan but worse,\" as a little joke to myself and a way to not have to see her name. Then her number and email were blocked all together. I saw that picture, though, and I had my first anxiety attack in a long while.\n\nNausea, shortness of breath, literal trembling; I ran to the bathroom and heaved up a lot of nothing before returning to my desk feeling like a cored apple. I am fortunate enough to have made great strides towards healing and finding my own identity. I know that PTSD is something that I can't just wish away or really even directly control at this point, but this is just getting a little old. I'm having a hard time staying patient with myself.\n\nRecently, I hung out with a group of buds who were getting together since their wives were having a girl's night. I just kind of felt like an alien, completely unable to relate to even the slightest bit of marriage related affairs. They would complain about the mundane annoyances of married life, and I just found myself at a loss for words, sitting there quiet and disassociated. \"At least your wife didn't try to sleep with an architect.\" \"At least your wife didn't try to sleep with her dentist.\" \"At least your wife didn't tell her whole family that she wished she had met her coworker before marrying you.\"\n\nI am an immensely more grateful person now, despite what it may sound like, and I wouldn't wish this kind of torture on anyone, not even my worst enemy (who just so happens to be the person who put me in this state of affairs). That being said, I have very little patience for the more trivial qualms of married folk. This had lead to a rather intense feeling of loneliness and isolation. Out of all the complex \"negative\" feelings that I have chosen to embrace, loneliness seems to be the most difficult. As far as I can tell, loneliness exists solely to remind me that I don't like being alone... no duh. Thanks loneliness... Loneliness is the kid who wasn't invited to the party because he doesn't like parties, but he showed up anyway to complain about how he doesn't like parties.\n\nBetween the loneliness stemming from my lack of capacity for emotional intimacy and the underlying symptoms of C-PTSD, I feel like a bit of a fraud. Many of my friends, old and new, comment on my strength and wisdom on this whole matter, but I spend most nights feeling like a charlatan. Out of my mouth you might hear me say, \"Hey, one day you will find someone who truly amazes you and accepts you for exactly who you are,\" and at the same time in my head I'm thinking, \"They WILL find someone, because they are great, but virtually the only prospects I have had that allude to any interest in me have come from yet more narcissists or people whom I don't find attractive, physically or otherwise.\"\n\nIt is unrealistic to really believe that my only options for a relationship in the future will involve me settling or just not having one all together. Ya' know, maybe there is someone out there. Who knows, but I haven't seen evidence of that other than from people who want to hurt me in disturbing ways. At this point, it is just as possible that healthy, happy people can be interested in me as it is that I only have a chance with destructive people. Bleck.\n\nNow that all of my clear objectives have been satisfied and completed, I feel like I am caught in yet another fog. I don't miss my previous relationship. Yes, it would have been nice if things didn't go as poorly as they had, but I wouldn't go back and change it, if I had the choice. God knows I don't want that fucking nightmare back in my life. I deeply love who I am for the first time in my life, yet I feel as unlovable as ever. Each day the actual memory of all the trauma and abuse fades a little more, but the feelings like loneliness and the C-PTSD stick around for longer. It is a cruel trick of psychology to have to watch the bleeding but forget the knife.\n\nI forgive my NexW for all of it, even the worst parts. All of the sexual, emotional, and verbal abuse just don't belong to me; it is hers, even if she tried to make believe it was mine. What I am left with now is myself, just myself. It has taken me so much time, effort, luck, pain, and attention to even understand and love myself as much as I do now. How the hell can I even begin to believe that another person will have that much time, energy, fortune, pain tolerance, and attention? I can't. That is where I am at, and there is a strange margin of melancholy comfort from staring at the blood. I can't change the fact that I was cut, and remembering the knife does me no good, in reality. I'm bleeding, though, and its nice to be alive. I just wish I didn't have to hurt to understand that right now.\n\nAnyway, thank you so much for entertaining my mindless driveling in the moments when I come back and post on this sub. You guys are paragons of kindness and understanding. This sub, at times, feels like the only place where I am safe.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We are childhood sweethearts and have been engaged for coming up on 2 of those years. For most of those years I would have considered myself happy, and there has never been a question in my mind that I deeply love them. In the past six months, the health of our relationship has deteriorated significantly; like I'm talking it has tanked.\n\nFor some context, we just moved cities and started truly living together for the first time in June. Additionally, we moved in with our closest friend. They helped us through a brief period three years ago when we were broken up, helped me come to terms with my sexuality, and helped both of us navigate finding what we wanted to do professionally. They have done so much for us and I love them deeply. The first red flag was the isolation. My s.o. began speaking really poorly about our friends over little things, began saying they were \"suffocating us\", and tried to intensely control the time I spent with them. This led to s.o. starting to mistreat my friends fairly openly. This broke/breaks my heart.\n\nIt was their mistreatment that made me reflect and realize just how much I have been mistreated (and for how long). I grew up very religious and have mastered self-neglect, so it took seeing someone else in pain to realize the pain s.o. was causing me. A friend sent me the \"Is your relationship healthy\" quiz that [loveisrespect.org](https://loveisrespect.org/) created, and the results were.... bad. Things I thought were normal were red flags. S.O. doesn't take interest in my interest, discourages me trying new things, admits to possessiveness and jealousy, controls my time with other people, has huge mood swings where I'm being yelled at one minute and doted on the next, and makes me feel like I need to walk on eggshells when talking about how I feel. When I brought this up, s.o. gaslighted me then later *admitted* to gaslighting, apologized, and thought life should just move on.\n\nOur relationship is in a very rocky place, and we are going to see counselors before doing anything (most likely taking a 3-4 week break before any decisions are made). The problem is that I am in love. And I feel like shit for doing what protects my emotional health because it feels like I am breaking s.o.'s heart and ending the relationship single-handedly. I have been doing a lot of self-blame and stuff; I am in love and can't imagine life outside of this relationship. I understand that doesn't mean the relationship is good for me, but that doesn't make it any easier.  \nHow do I cope with this storm of conflicting feelings?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I know it's long but I appreciate any feedback I can get, I've never been in a situation like this before*\n\n**TL;DR** I don't know what to do about my emotionally abusive partner.\n\n**About me**  \n21F, low maintenance partner, moderate anxiety and depression (I am medicated), dad left when I was 13 so I have minor attachment/reassurance issues and probably a low standard for men I let into in my life.\n\n**About him**  \n20M, very charismatic and cultured, successful job, heavy stoner, anger issues, deep insecurity that causes overconfidence, and a horrible relationship with his mother\\* that I think has caused a lot of his emotional flaws.\n\n*\\*Textbook emotional abuse. His mother is honestly one of the most evil people I have met. She is rude and controlling and pretentious. She controls my partner in every way she can, ordering him to give her money, fix and clean everything in their house for no reason. She constantly makes him feel like he is never doing anything right and she's always identifying problems with him that don't exist.*\n\n**About us**  \nWe've been dating for almost 1 year. We are very similar in some ways, so we get along really well when he's in a good mood\\*\\* He's really funny and can always make me laugh. He's pretty affectionate and romantic with his words. We hang out almost every day and usually just chill at my house. We're getting better at communicating our differences, and we've grown a lot together.\n\n\\*\\*this is a key factor. See point #2 below for details as it will come up a lot.\n\n**The red flags** (chronological order of when they started appearing)\n\n1. He likes to tease and berate. It's funny most of the time but some of the time it's actually hurtful because it's teasing me for stuff I don't expect to get teased for, like the way I talk or the way I've said something. *(eg: you're doing something ordinary, like ordering a coffee. you order it normally. and think nothing of it. then one of your friends starts making fun of you and berating how you ordered it. not a big deal at all, but would still make you second guess yourself the next time you order a coffee).* It should be noted that if you do this to him (never do it), he can not take a joke at all, see #2.\n2. I have always felt like I'm walking on eggshells around him. If I say the wrong thing or respond to one of his jokes or insults the wrong way, it can ruin a night. **Our time together is so dependant on whether or not he's in a good mood**. If he's in a good mood, we're fine. If he's in a bad mood, it's awful. He's VERY sensitive, so his mood can change very easily. **If I happen to do or say the wrong thing, he becomes quiet and cold the whole night**. Often times this will happen after a situation where I have stuck up for myself. When I ask what's bothering him he always says nothing.\n3. If I get mad about something he's done, he usually just says stuff like \"I don't have a leg to stand on\" or \"Everything's my fault\" and then he'll just do what I explained in #2. Often times he will just start to get mad at me for something completely different.  \n(One time I found out he had been texting other girls for booty calls, and confronted him about it and he just got mad at me for not telling him I knew about it sooner. He then started accusing *me* of cheating and started screaming at me.)\n4. He brings his phone everywhere, including the bathroom. I've never met any of his close friends and have caught him lying, and trying to cheat on multiple occasions.\n5. He is exponentially more temperamental **when he's been drinking**. The difference is substantial. (see #6 as well)\n6. When he is angry or in a bad mood, one of the scariest things about him is that he stops caring about other's perceptions of him. He will be cold and rude to my mom or my friends if he is in a bad mood, he will shout or yell in public. Overall, he lets his emotions get the best of him in situations where that's not appropriate.\n7. **Physical Abuse.** *I've divided into sections for clarity.*  \n\n   1. He started getting physical with me early on. It started by accident. We were play fighting near my stairs and he ended up pushing me down half a flight by mistake. I started to cry because it was startling, and explained that I knew it was an accident (because I knew if I didn't, he would just get sensitive and #2 would happen). Instead of apologizing, he just said that he felt bad and that he wanted to leave. **It felt like a weird punishment,** he's the one leaving because I'm crying.\n   2. A few more (less that 5) occurrences happened sporadically where he would slap me when we were fighting, and then claim immediately after that it was because he misread the situation. His reasoning I suppose it that slapping is condoned in our bedroom (ONLY when we are having sex and ONLY when I am expecting it) and maybe he thought we were in a sexy situation or something.\n   3. The worst time was after a wedding. He was drinking the whole night, and at the dinner table at the wedding he started getting mad at me about is name on my phone. There wasn't any hearts or emojis next to it, just his name. He starts visibly getting angry with me in front of his family. Then he brings up how many sexual partners I've had before I met him and starts getting mad about that out of nowhere for no reason, again within an earshot of his family. I say lets talk somewhere more private. Now we are in the lobby of one of the nicest hotels in my city and he is screaming at me. I say I feel afraid that I want to leave. He says if I leave he's going to break up with me. I leave and he chases after me. We are now on the street in front of the hotel, and he starts grabbing at me and pulling my hair. Still to this day I'm so sad none of the many bystanders and witnesses to this intervened. We get in an uber and he starts slapping me and pulling my hair and punching my thigh. He is screaming at me about very personal things in the uber (the driver is in the car!!!!), and at one point grabs my phone out of my hand and throws it hard at the car door. When we get out of the uber he yells at me to stop crying and then hits me so hard I fall to the ground. I hit my face on his driveway and immediately adrenaline kicks in and I just start running away as fast as I can. I can hear him screaming my name down his block (he lives in a very nice neighbourhood, he probably got a noise complaint.  \nI hid behind a dumpster and emerged after 5 minutes to find a lovely couple who I've never met. They said the uber driver saw them walking on the street and told them what happened. The driver told them to call the police and to make sure I was ok. They called me an uber home, god bless their souls.  \nThe guilt must've sunk in immediately because he knocked on my door later that night trying to apologize, but my mom just told him to leave. The next morning he told me he didn't remember what happened. I went to his house and told him to meet me outside, he saw bandaids on my face and my swollen nose and started to cry. **Immediately he acknowledged almost every single one of his short-comings in our relationship and begged me to stay with him and promised he'd do anything to change.** This happened August 2019. I consider it one of the most traumatizing occurrences of my life.\n8. He spooks me, literally. He is constantly trying to scare me by jumping out or sneaking up behind me and yelling \"BOO!\". I know he's just joking, but still. He also sometimes shows me boxing techniques, and will air box in front of me. Like right in front. To the point where he will stop a punch 6 inches from my face. I've expressed that it makes me uncomfortable but he says he has full control over his depth perception. Again, I know it's just a joke but that stuff actually scares me because he could just fully hit me by mistake if he miscalculates.\n9. He displays symptoms of gas-lighting occasionally, he is also a semi-frequent liar.\n10. He has tried to get me to go off my medication on multiple occasions.\n11. We always always always do what he wants to do, whether it's how we spend our time, where we go for food, etc. When we do what I want to do (which is almost never), he doesn't even pretend to have fun and usually just gets into a bad mood and ruins the night (see #2).\n12. His behaviour is very performative, especially how he treats me. He rarely asks me questions about my day or my life, but claims to be very supportive of me. I guess that's words over actions.\n\nThat's all I can think of at the moment. Many of these issues have gotten better through communication over time. I really do love him so I try my best to be patient with his change. There have been major improvements definitely, but everything is still just so dependant on his mood. It's frustrating. But we've been good recently, and the relationship has been healthy for the most part.\n\n**The reason I am writing this**  \nSomething weird happened last night: We were making dinner at my house and he suddenly out of nowhere he bolts out the front door. He opens it and yells \"Hey aren't you coming?\" and then slams the door. Then there was complete silence, so I determined he went back outside. Now at this point, I was REALLY high from weed (he knows weed makes me SUPER paranoid and jumpy), so I'm obviously a little taken aback but the suddenness of this \"joke\". I really didn't know what was going on. So I decide to follow him outside to see where this joke was going, or what was going on. When I get to my front foyer, he jumps out at me and yells really loud to scare me. I wasn't expecting it because I thought he was outside , so I screamed super loudly and then started to cry and fell into a panic attack. I've NEVER reacted that way to being startled or spooked. He handled it pretty well, apologized. He acted a little cold after, probably would have been a lot worse if I hadn't apologized for freaking out so hard. But it made me realize something: **My partner may have given me PTSD**. From the physical abuse for sure, but what about from the emotional abuse? I felt embarrassed reacting that way to him just \"joking\" around, so I started overthinking. After he left last night I started googling things. I wanted to know if him scaring me was more than just a joke, if I was right to react the way I did. A lot of the websites I went on indicated signs of emotional abuse and his actions tick almost every single box.\n\nI guess I just feel stuck. I know bringing up my concerns with him will be difficult, he'll rebut and he'll probably act all butt-hurt, or try and say that he's joking. **But I do think I'm being emotionally abused, and I would like to not be anymore.**\n\n*What should I do?*", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Apologies in advance for the long post. \n\nI (25f) started dating this guy (30m) about 3 months ago. Prior to dating him, I got out of a really bad relationship (extreme narcissism, abusive, ect) and was single for a few months before trying to date. I met this guy on Tinder and the first and second dates were amazing. We were able to talk openly and the conversation never faltered. I was open and honest about the fact that I got out of a bad relationship and therefore, was making myself and my happiness a priority. I started a new job and am also going to school, and he was well aware of that going into this. My schedule is limited as far as when we can hang out, but I\u2019m always accommodating. He said he was patient and knew that school/work were priorities. Anyway - like I said before, things in the beginning were great. He\u2019s hilarious, smart, career driven, and super sweet. But all of a sudden it seems like there is a new side to him. For instance: after working four 10 hour shifts (I\u2019m an OR nurse so on my feet the entire time), I told him that I didn\u2019t feel up to hanging out that night and was going to stay home and clean. I was exhausted and honestly didn\u2019t feel like being around people after being around 100s of patients in a four day time span. He was fine with it but then texted me later on to see what I was doing and I told him that I was at the dog park with my dogs. He got sooo mad and said that it was rude of me to go there when I knew he was sitting at home alone with nothing to do. Then he didn\u2019t want to talk to me that night because he said he was in a bad mood and hung up the phone when I called him to discuss why he was upset about me going to the dog park. It all just rubbed me the wrong day and I\u2019m really questioning my feelings now. It\u2019s like a switch has been turned off in me and now I really have no desire to even see him.

It has evolved from they broke up in February this year, to after that they tried to work things out on and off before he \u201cfinally ended things for good\u201d seemingly much more recently then he initially stated. \n\n- This one is just odd but he changed his answer to a question mid sentence, I asked him if he\u2019d seen a movie and he said no, and then I kind of joked like \u201comg who hasn\u2019t seen that\u201d and then all of a sudden he knew what i was talking about and said his ex made him watch it.\n\n- this last weekend he didn\u2019t try to initiate any plans with me, but didn\u2019t mention anything else that was going on.

So now I'm here, asking the internet for help.\n\nFirst the positives about my mother as a parent: pays for everything I need and lots of things I don't, (e.g. medical care, therapy a couple years ago, dual access classes at my local university, gas and provides rides or a car to get there, piano lessons, food while I'm out, clothes I need, and the like), she is typically friendly and warm (asking about my day, inviting me on walks...etc), compliments me, she even let me get a kitten, she's also never hit me besides spanking when I was little (she did slap my brother once though)\n\nNow the negatives: Shouts/screams at both me and my dad (and my brother when he lived with us), often says I'm \"being an asshole/bitch\", denies any direct quotes from her I try to bring up, often ignores a question for 10 seconds or even a minute or so after I ask because she's looking at her phone/texting someone/the like, has called me \"broken\" a few times, has threatened to hurt me (in a joking manner usually), says or implies I hate her and/or I'm intentionally hurting her.\n\nShe has forced me to completely strip, bra, underwear and all, twice (she thought I was self harming). She did this while screaming at me about it, she was not at all comforting or supportive. She did it once when I was 14, once when i was 15. Both times I didn't want to and was very uncomfortable. Once was in front of my dad, who was clearly also uncomfortable. I was spanked when I was really young, but she also spanked me once when I was older, maybe 8 or 9. She said when I was maybe 14 that I had a \"cute little butt\" and lightly slaps or pinches my butt occasionally even now (I'm 17 right now).\n\nSome direct quotes from her: \"I have no desire to be in the same room with you.\" \"I don't know how you have friends if you act like this around them.\" All in reference to me: \"hostile monster\" \"bully\" \"heartless\" \"attention seeking\".\n\nPlease help me, I don't know if these are normal things for parents to do/say when they're mad or. I'm so confused because she's nice most of the time but this shit really hurts and I can't tell if I'm overreacting or if this is verbal and/or emotional abuse.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I was empathetic yet firm with him. I stood my ground and told him he can never be happy. Not the way he is. And it\u2019s why his relationships always fail.

In the times when I've taken my therapist's advice in having sit downs with him about how he makes me feel sometimes with his over-critical aspects i'm always met with that i'm too sensitive or that he only wants what's best for me.  \n\n\nAnd in my experiences of facing abuse and dealing with it I've learned that abuse isn't just hostel sounding it can mask itself in a parental concern that can come off as \" I just want what's best for you\" but it really is just pushing the receiver of that abuse away.  \n\n\n last night 10/21/19 was probably the first time that he's ever lashed out at me and it was over something small like our puppy crapping upstairs in the attic which he's gotten better about not doing since we actively have him avoid that part of the house but my roommate never closes doors so much that I need to get up and stop what i'm doing immediately just to close the doors to avoid confrontation but when the dog got past him i'm guessing while he was downstairs or in the bathroom I hear him exclaim but I can't clear out what he said so I go over to check if he's okay and that's when the yelling happened, I quietly stood there choked up and feeling every inch of me drenched in a fear I thought I forgot / left when I moved out of my hometown and I put the family dog in their bed before going to clean the mess and then ring up a friend about what just happened and frantically explaining my confusion and fear at why he got so mad over a small thing or why that he felt the need to get in my face so loudly.\n\nit's the day after and my roommates mother picked me up from my friends house, and my friend tried mediating something on discord but it seems he's more upset and infuriated at the fact that I ran away for a night. I don't know what to make of this because other people say he sounds guilty and upset but also he sounds upset more at me then himself and I don't know what to make of anything and I don't have the money to move out and live alone again and I don't want to go through shelter living again. This event and small occurrences have just more and more made me question and i'm tired of being bombarded by questions in my head and feeling guilty for everything", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I just finished reading \"Becoming the Narcissit's Nightmare\" by Shahida Arabi. To say it caused a moment of pure emotional clarity and alleviate mounds of stress would be an understatement. This post is my first attempt to put into words the past 7 months of hell I have endured at the hand of an N.\n\nA week and a half ago,  my so called \"soulmate\" (23F) decided she rather be alone than wait on me and broke up with me. Some backstory, I (25M) am currently deployed and have been away for three months. We were together the three months up until I left. During those three months, we spent every single second together. This time was filled with amazing memories that I thought were real. The promises she made to be here when I got back so we could start our family together kept me going through long days over here. After about a month in, the love stopped pouring in and she began distancing herself. Even before I left, anytime I brought up an issue in the relationship, I was immediately controlling her and smothering her. \n\nHer Instagram posts were almost always the point of contention. Why does she feel the need to post such sultry, provocative things if I was truly giving her all she needed? If I was so amazing, why was she turning to a public account filled with countless people I did not know in order to gain approval? Nothing made sense and it was always either my fault, her parents, or her ex-husband. Every person from their past was crazy and I was her knight in shining armor. I gave her a credit card linked to my bank account, sent monthly payments to ensure she never had a bill to pay. All in the aspirations to support her educational/professional endeavors. She turned those against me as my attempt to control her. \n\nI received two messages while  I was gone of her infidelity. The first one came when I had only been gone a month. Rather than console me, or empathize with my strife, she immediately launched a tirade of attacks against me. \"You dont trust me\" \"That person is crazy\" \"I would never cheat\" I had no choice but to believe her in order to save the relationship. It was not until I would tell her that I was considering leaving that she decided to turn on the love faucet. Telling me the things she knew I love to hear and that would satisfy the overwhelming addiction she caused me to have. \n\nNothing I did was ever good enough, or my acts of love were attempts for me to control her. She started going out all of the time, barely texting or acknowledging my existence. Anytime I would call when she got home, she immediately got defensive and lashed out with anger. I was never allowed to ask who the new guy was commenting, liking, etc. on her social media posts. I felt crazy because everything wrong was my fault. Anytime I brought up an issue, she told me I had changed. That she knew this would happen. She needed consistency and any issue I brought up automatically made me unreliable and inconsistent. When I pointed out all of these hot and cold moments with her, she told me she would never be consistent.\n\nThe promises she made of marriage, kids, the white picket fence now revolted her. She told me that she no longer wished to get married. When I told her that changes the very dynamic of the relationship, I once again was controlling her and did not care about what she had to say. She constantly told me her priorities had changed now that she was in college. I reminded her we agreed to wait to get married and have kids until she was ready. That agreement was no longer valid. She constantly went back and forth, one moment I am the love of her life and she cannot wait to marry me. The next moment, marriage disgusts her and she never wants a husband again. \n\nIt all culminated when I received a message from a stranger on instagram that she cheated on me. She met with the same tactics of demanding trust and belief in her story. Even though she continued to lie about the circumstances of the night within question. I broke down and sobbed. This was not the first time. I had more panic attacks and emotional breakdowns these past three months caused by her actions than I did combat. \n\nI could not believe my soulmate could be so cruel. The following two days were filled with love she had not shown since the day we met. After these two days, the love faucet once again turned off. Now, she was telling me my family was too involved, even though a month prior they were the best family she could hope for. It was no longer okay for me to go to my mom for emotional support when she crushed my soul in arguments. My support system in her eyes was an army that sought to destroy and judge her. I told her that I would tell them to stop the comments on social media and tell them to stop reaching out as much. This drove her into an immediate rage. She cut me off completely. She told me she rather be alone than wait on me. That I did everything right and she was not happy. That she loved me still.\n\nThe social media posts and damage control she did was spectacular. She eradicated me from her life in a systematic fashion. At the encouragement of friends and the book, I blocked everything to create space for myself. However, the posts, the stories, everything I saw was that she had all the attention she needed. The new followers swarmed in to give her the fix she craves. I was cast to the side as the next crazy ex she can demean to her next victim.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

His mother thought she was upper class and didn\u2019t like me at all as my parents weren\u2019t upper class and I didn\u2019t know the right etiquette all the time. He was only 18 months older than me and was quite normal at first. \n\nMy son was born with multiple health needs and I had to give up work to look after him and I had a daughter a few years after that. \n\nHe never outright said nasty stuff to me but there was a lot of passive aggression going on. He would tell friends who came round that my housekeeping wasn\u2019t very good. When I got upset by some thing that happened (and with a special needs kid with autism that is quite a lot) he thought I was \u201cover emotional\u201d. He said that a lot - if he upset me then I was over sensitive. Or that it was a joke and that I didn\u2019t have a sense of humour. \n\nHe found work away from the home and only came home after the kids were in bed and then at weekends he was too busy or too tired to do stuff as a family.  But obviously since I didn\u2019t work and he had to earn the money then I couldn\u2019t complain. \n\nIt was also wrong of me to need antidepressants. Apparently they changed my personality - which was probably a good thing since I was suicidal when diagnosed. But if I came off them and struggled and cried then he just suggested going to the doctor. He could sit on the other side of the room and watch me cry - he didn\u2019t react at all. \n\nI saw him cry 3 times in 20 years - twice in pain and once when our son was very very sick. \n\nI could go on about how he got me into swinging by posting pornographic pictures of me on the internet and then telling me how much people liked my photos. Even at the end of our marriage when I asked him to stop posting them he carried on secretly - but in my name telling the recipients that I wanted to have sex with them. \n\nWell the swinging turned out to be a good thing. I gained a lot of self confidence and asked him for a divorce. \n\nBut the tipping point : our son\u2019s mobility was decreasing fast and we lived in an old property with steps into every room. I said we should move and he said no because \u201cson was only a quarter of the family and as such wouldn\u2019t move just for him...\u201d\n\nHe got a hell of a shock when I asked for a divorce. He pointed around the room and asked whether I wanted to give it all up ie the big house. Well yes I did want to give it up to provide my kids with a happy and SAFE place to live. \n\nBecause I didn\u2019t work I didn\u2019t earn any money and so when I finally asked for a divorce he wasn\u2019t going to split the finances because I didn\u2019t earn the money. Wrong.... that\u2019s not how that works...\n\nSo I left after 2 years (long story but I never changed my mind).

To preface, we're both artists and have some crossover in our fields. In many ways, we're extremely similar, we have similar friend-groups, humour, sex is good, lifestyles. Some of his major trauma and subsequent insecurities stem from feeling abandoned/not wanted as a child by his divorced parents and an abusive/toxic relationship where the person played mind games on him and cheated, etc.\n\nSome examples of how this is being passed on in detrimental ways:\n\n1. Twice he's asked me as we're starting to have sex why my \"pussy smells like another man's cum\". I think his ex did this purposefully to him once, but it's out of order.\n2.

After 7 years with this person I now don't really like sharing it with her.\n\nI do and I don't.\n\nOn one hand I want her approval because I love her and her opinion matters.\n\nBut on the other hand, telling her about anything good that happens to me actually makes her feel uncomfortable.  \n\nShe's so complacent about me now that her mask is half-slipped a lot of the time.  \n\nIt's like there's a vibe you know.  My achievements piss her off.\n\nI spent months writing a song and she doesn't listen to it and give me any feedback.  She showed no interest.  I contributed to something media related and it was significant to me.  She never once asked me about it or wanted to find out what was happening.  She just seems to ignore stuff so she doesn't have to be in a position to validate it.  It's so weird.  I've never even suggested I need her validation either.

Not to brag, but just because I'm happy and I know some close people care.\n\nMy daughter is 11 and it just seems so natural for both of us just to blurt out something we're happy about, something great which occurred in our lives.  No ego, no defensiveness, no competitiveness.\n\nBut when I want to share something with my GF.   Depending what it is I might have totally different results.  She'll get noticeably envious if I get a good deal in my job.  So one minute I'm saying that I'm happy about a good deal and then she'll immediately start talking about how she'll never pay off her credit card.  Or she'll tell me about a \u00a310 thing she wants but she has to wait till next month to buy it.\n\nI don't want her to act all competitive about everything because it makes me feel like I'm competing when I tell her things.  Not because I am, but because to her I am.  This sets such a bad tone to our relationship.\n\nI have to tell her stuff by text now.\n\nAnd she'll go \"WOW, WELL DONE BABE!!!\", \"I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!\"\n\nAnd it will be totally empty.\n\nThen when we see each other she won't even mention it.  So over text it was this amazing thing.  But suddenly it doesn't exist when we're together.

Ten years ago, my first real, serious relationship was with a narcissist. I didn\u2019t realize this until I went to a therapist. It took me about four years to regain my voice and build back up my self-esteem and self-worth. And I honestly still struggle from time to time especially when it comes to relationships\n\nI\u2019ve never been good at setting boundaries or should I say sticking to them. I started dating a guy at the end of February. He reminded me so much of my narcissistic ex in little ways but I ignored it. I thought that I possibly couldn\u2019t have found another person just like him. And now, I\u2019m here almost 8 months later wondering how I got wrapped in with someone so toxic again. Back in therapy and I feel like I\u2019m at a breaking point.\n\nThe love bombing started early on. I fell for it hard because I\u2019ve been single for awhile. It seemed so real and genuine. We were quick to spend a lot of time together. There were little flags here and there like small lies that I let slip. Then bigger lies that I ignored. Then it started with some put downs. He would get close then pull away. Then would come back when he needed something from me. I would always be right there waiting. \n\nIn the 8 months, I\u2019ve tried to leave maybe a half of dozen times. I don\u2019t know why I stay. I know better. \n\nWe had a big blow out last week and he said he needed space. I blocked him and was ready to go no contact. But failed after 4 days. \n\nWe spent a great night together and he was sweet like the guy I missed. The next night he went to ignoring me so I swung by his house to talk to him. There was a woman walking up to his door as I was pulling up. She walked in and I knocked on the door. He was never so shocked in his life. It\u2019s not my proudest moment. I told her he was a piece of shit who\u2019s been dating me for several months. She walked out the door without saying a word. \n\nHe berated me for 45 mins telling me he never wanted a relationship with me. I wasn\u2019t woman enough. I was lazy. That I didn\u2019t check off the boxes for him. He said how could I think we could ever have a relationship because we slept together on the first date? He said I was lucky that he didn\u2019t knock me out right there. He threw in that he did love me and thought about a future with me and marrying me but he had road blocks he couldn\u2019t get past. He said so just much more but I was so hysterical I don\u2019t even remember it all. I left telling him that I was sorry I wasn\u2019t enough for him. \n\nHe texted me about 15 mins later. He asked if we could talk the next day. He was sorry about how things went down. Then called and said the same thing. I told him I would think about it. Then texts me in 1:30 in the morning saying he wanted me to come lay with him. \n\nThe next day we talked and he acted like nothing ever happened. When I tried to bring it up, he wouldn\u2019t talk about it. He asked me to come over and I foolishly did. I so desperately wanted to believe him when he said he loved me. \n\nI wrote out all the bad things he is done and all his bad shit yet I still keep going back.

I can never shake off the feeling that something is not quite right with him, even though in person and on paper he seems extraordinary, I'm starting to hear alarm bells go off.  I think he might be a Covert N. \n\nDo narcissists have periods of time where they text you constantly, constantly, constantly?  This happened mostly in the beginning but a other times since then.  He prefers texting over any other mode of contact. Sometimes I wonder if he prefers it over even meeting up.  He travels a lot so we got into the pattern of communicating over whatsapp.\n\nIn the beginning, we would text for HOURS at a time, all day long.  He initiated it and it was at all hours of the day.  I enjoyed the attention at first but at some point it felt difficult to get any work done and I didn't feel at liberty to shut the conversation down because if I did, he'd just keep texting me!  Even at 3am, 4am, he'd be sending me texts and asking me questions or sending sexually suggestive things. It didn't matter if I was at work, in bed, or if I told him I was spending time with family or friends.  Texts nonstop!  \n\nI should have drawn a boundary but half of me was flattered by the attention, and the other half felt resigned to keep texting nonstop because even when I stopped responding, he'd keep texting me and I felt pressure to respond sooner than later.  \n\nThen, as soon as I felt as if I was getting comfortable with our constant rate of communication, blam, he would go off the radar for a day or 2, maybe only sending me a handful of messages and being super busy and would be hard to reach.\n\nIs this constant texting a Narc thing? Or is this a normal thing that couples in the honeymoon phase do?\n\nHe was also really pushy sometimes over text, but in a \"nice\" way, always asking for various types of photos of myself and always upping the ante and trying to push my boundaries and he would not leave it alone.  \n\n\nSorry if this post is scattered, I'm just happy to find this place and reading these posts is making all these random memories pop back up and I have so many questions!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

They give me a court date to appear before the judge to ask to be granted the Harassment order. \n\nThe night before the hearing my dog eats an unidentified object in the back yard that looked as though it was tossed over the fence. I induce vomit her and rush her to the vet. She gets a ton of testing done and prescribed vitamins for poisoning. Fast forward about a week and I was rushing out the door late for work and forgot to give her a dose. I get a call from my mother saying my dog won't stand up at all and can't walk. I had forgotten to give her a morning dose and ask my mom to give her the missed dose. Within the 20 mins it took me to get from work to the house and into the door, my dog saw me and visibly struggled to stand.

The judge granted me the H.O. the D.A. wanted to hear what happened to me, but in a room surrounded by childrens toys, my mother, her best friend, and women he didn't bother introducing to me which turned out to be an intern.\nHe was very kind, but the last thing I wanted to do after seeing my rapist at the court house was to relive what happened again, nvm surrounded by childrens things and my mother while crying so much I had then officially made to feel as though I was a child.\nI wish I had just asked to  speak to the D.A. alone in a different room.\nSo, fast forward a few months. I feel miscommunicated and judged by the community as we know hundreds of the same people. I feel like if I put my guard down I could be risking my life or my dogs life or my familys life. I'm afraid to tell anyone my work schedule because idk who could be plotting against me or wants me to keep my mouth shut. I can feel my mental health deteriorating. I've little to no ability to trust anyone anymore. I've felt people being condescending and quick to judge my energy, or being belittled and sometimes even expressing my ptsd triggers, and then being met with them then hitting those triggers on purpose . Its stunted my growth in a career that I love. I'm slowly beginning to leave survival mode but feel once I do something terrible might happen. \n\nMaybe I'm just venting to the void but I hope someone out there can help me understand how I could pull myself out of this or can share any advice at all\n\nThank you.\nTo whom ever reads this, cares, has something to say, or doesnt know what to say but still cares; May you never experience such struggle and may you be blessed in your lifetime.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

It was at a Halloween party, and I was very drunk. I was dancing with a guy and at some point ended up pushed against a wall. I know he fingered me because it hurt so badly and I think put my hand down his pants. The memories are so fuzzy though that I can\u2019t remember what I went along with willingly (although I was wasted so \u201cwillingly\u201d is somewhat meaningless maybe?). Eventually I got the attention of a friend to help me get away. When I got back to my dorm I was too drunk to walk up the stairs and I remember just sitting on the floor laughing hysterically. I have past trauma from an abusive relationship in high school so I don\u2019t even know how much was the alcohol and how much was just me completely freezing up and dissociating. Like I wasn\u2019t completely black out drunk but I couldn\u2019t walk. \n\nThe thing is, for a long time I never classified this as an assault. I hated myself for it. I thought I was a slut (even though I would never judge a girl even for willingly doing that; the self hatred just really ran deep). I found out later that the guy was laughing with all his friends about the situation and it had even became some \u201cin joke\u201d at his fraternity, and I literally became suicidal. (The only saving grace was that most of them didn\u2019t know my identity because the party was so dark, so I was just some random girl.) It didn\u2019t help that no one I knew seemed to think it was anything significant. The friend that helped me get away actually became close friends with the guy and would hang out when they\u2019d all laugh about it. Only two of the frat guys knew it was me (I\u2019m not sure how - I guess she told them or they got a better look at me) and apparently at one point one of them did pull her aside and ask her seriously if I was okay, so that was the one good thing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until two years later when I was talking with my boyfriend that I realized it might not have been actually consensual. He was the first person to act like something might be off, and it was like all I needed was some confirmation that hey, maybe if I could barely walk and can\u2019t remember much I was too drunk, to start reconsidering things. My therapist was the first person to call it an assault and it felt both terrifying and oddly relieving. Anyway it\u2019s been a year since that, and I still find myself struggling a lot. Part of me can\u2019t accept that it was an assault, even though I know it happened to someone else I would think it was. But also, I guess I have this \u201cwell even if it was assault it wasn\u2019t that bad so I should be over it\u201d kind of mindset. Which is causing problems because it\u2019s the 3 year anniversary and I\u2019m upset and then I\u2019m also upset that I\u2019m upset because I should be over it.\n\nSorry this is so long. I guess I just want to know if anyone has advice on how to move on from this. I feel so angry. Honestly I feel less angry at him for what he did than at his frat bros and my friend for all laughing about it, which doesn\u2019t even make sense. I\u2019m mostly angry at myself though because I keep feeling as though I let this happen. And maybe I did? I don\u2019t know.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Our relationship started with lies and it ended with lies. To this day I don't know what was true and what wasn't since he has never been brave enough to tell me the truth. He would rather lie to me than to own up to his mistakes. Throughout, the relationship I always felt something was off and when I would question our relationship/his commitment he would turn it to me not trusting him. Trust was big to him and he constantly told me that if I couldn't trust him then there was no point to us being together.  He would hint that I simply wanted to start arguments and this got more direct/hurtful as time went on. Part of our relationship was long-distance and while he was in another country he got another woman pregnant and married her. He had cheated on here with me technically. I had to find this out from a friend of his. When I confronted him he came up with more lies. It has been 4 months since I found out and almost 2 months since the last time I spoke with him. Even, with time I still feel hurt and in some twisted way, I miss him or rather what I thought we had. The time I spent with him really tore away at my self-esteem because I began to believe what he told me about myself. That I was overreactive, insecure, and twisted everything to my convenience.

I feel like I lost my intuition when I was with him except now everything seems like a red flag in new friendships/relationships.

It's relatively harmless and easy to minimize through regular bathing and some exfoliation, though unsanitary living conditions made it a lot worse when I was a kid. My upper arms were like sandpaper. Thus begins this weird, gross story... My mom has a fixation on pimple popping. I'm sure you can see where this is going. On top of spending a lot of time picking at her own face in the mirror, she used to call me into her room and make me lay down on her bed so she could pick at my arms and back. Usually I was shirtless, even during and after puberty, and it only got worse when said puberty started causing mad back acne. On top of being forced to be half naked for sometimes more than an hour with my mom and brother hovering over me, they'd talk about how disgusting and dirty I was for being covered in acne the whole time and admonish me for not taking care of myself, when I didn't even know how to yet. It caused some really deep seated body image issues that I still struggle with. \n\nThis lasted for years, starting before I can even remember up until my older brother finally moved out when I was 13 or 14, as the only reason I wasn't able to avoid it was because she would send him to go chase me down, harass me, or pick me up and carry me to have my ass beat or my arms picked at... depending on the day. She would literally scream at me or send my older brother to do it for her for refusing to go lay shirtless on her bed, and let her prod at my back and arms and sometimes butt with her blunt fingernails or a pair or tweezers.\n\nEven after he moved out, she would try to convince me it was for my own good that she was doing it, despite the fact picking at blemishes *increases* the chance of infection. I had to start doing it myself to get her off my back, and now even years and years later I have this habit, I pick at my skin obsessively, especially when I'm anxious, it's become a really gross defense mechanism or compulsion or something. \n\nThis is so specific that I'm terrified of her finding this and knowing I wrote it right away, but I've never even talked to a therapist or close friend about this. I just need to know it's not my fault I guess. I can sort of accept that I'm allowed to be upset when I talk about physical abuse, neglect, sexual harassment, etc, but I've literally never opened up about this because it's so gross and I was always told during that it was my fault it was happening for being gross, and that I was being ridiculous for not wanting to strip in front of my mom.

{"post_id": "dlvls0", "created_utc": 1571814579, "title": "I feel compelled to relive my childhood abuse in order to enjoy sex, and I hate it", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "\n\nI can't talk to anyone about this. I feel so weird and twisted. First off, I have ADHD, mild autism, and severe anxiety. I have a *lot* of intrusive thoughts and a tendency to get stuck in patterns.\n\nAnyway, when I was little my mom's boyfriend would tie me up and molest me. Then when that ended my older sister, who he had probably abused too, started molesting me every night (we shared a bed). Neither of them did anything that hurt me physically, just clitoral and vulva stimulation, so instead of having overtly negative feelings about it I enjoyed it and got addicted to it. Sure I felt constant shame and became depressed at age 9, but I didn't realize it was because of that.\n\nI started sleeping with older teens and grown men when I was 11, and I felt like being so young  made me cooler. \n\nWhen I turned 16, I started to feel like something wasn't right. I felt too old. I started having to imagine I was a kid again in order to orgasm. (Note: I am not attracted to kids. I have no desire or compulsion to do or view anything sexual involving kids. I don't even picture the body of my own younger self.) \n\nAnd that's when I met the worst possible person for me to meet at that time in my life. He was in his early 20s, and paid me a lot of attention. He was nicer than anyone had ever been to me, and we became best friends. We told each other everything, including what had happened to me as a young child.\n\nOne night I was drunk, on pills, and actively suicidal. I went over to his house and he talked me down and comforted me. Once I was feeling better, I looked at him and told him it looked like he had 7 eyes, and he kissed me. We made out.\n\nHe dumped his (17-year-old) girlfriend and we started dating. \n\nHe wanted to be called 'daddy' during sex. Okay, not really my bag but whatever. Then he wanted to tie me up. Hell yeah, I love that shit. Then he wanted to roleplay 'daddy/daughter'. Ummmm... I was 16, so I was like, that's kinda weird but I'll play along. After all, I was familiar with that as a porn category so I figured it must be fairly normal?\n\nAt some point he told me a vague, confusing story about having to move in with his mom when he was a teen because his dad's house caught fire which resulted in a stash of child porn being discovered. The way he told it was odd, but he made it sound like it was his dad's... While also kind of implying that it was actually his, but in a way that it seemed like I just misunderstood.\n\nThen when I was 18 he told me he wanted to have a daughter with me and abuse her.\n\nIt all suddenly made sense. I realized this dude was a fucking predator who had chosen me for a reason, groomed me, taken advantage of me, fetishized my abuse experience, had been making me act out his fantasy version of it every time we had sex, and had been testing the waters until he felt safe proposing that I continue the cycle of abuse with him.\n\nI dumped his ass immediately, but the damage to my psyche had been done. Instead of working through my issues, I'd let him encourage the fuck out of them.\n\nI moved on and met my husband. Affectionate, romantic sex turns me off, so I got him into BDSM.  It wasn't enough, though. Not only do I need the sex to be as much like an assault as possible, I also have to imagine I'm a kid. I can't look at his face. I have to look away or shut my eyes and imagine a faceless aggressor, probably because I have no memory of what my abuser looks like. Or that might not matter, because it's just the concept of being abused and having an abuser in general that I get off on. I also masturbate 1-3 times a day, and have to basically imagine my abuse in order to orgasm. Except it's not really the abuse I went through, since I've added physical pain and humiliation. I guess to work through the mental pain and humiliation that I didn't understand at the time? Or to punish myself.\n\nSo after I orgasm, I always feel 2 things. \n1. A profound sense of guilt and shame, \nAnd 2. Violated. Like he's still victimizing me from beyond the grave.\n\nI hate how he has completely hijacked my entire libido.\n\nI hate that the only way I can enjoy sex with the sweet man I love is to pretend he's my abuser. That I can't make love or say his name or even really look at his face. I need sex to be an ordeal that I have to grit my teeth through, and then I need him to comfort me afterwards as if sleeping with him is something bad that has happened to me (he doesn't mind, because aftercare is actually an important part of bdsm, but I feel guilty anyway).\n\nI agonize over this, but I'm too embarassed to talk to a therapist, and I'm afraid if I tell my husband or anyone they'll misunderstand and think I'm saying I have sexual thoughts about children (I mean, other than my own past self. And those thoughts aren't really ABOUT her, they're more... AS her.)\n\nThe only bright spot is that since my kids hit the age I was abused at, the lower limit of ages I imagine I am has been rising to always be older than my kids. Right now the oldest is 12, so now I'm never younger than 13 in my fantasies. Another 5 years and I'll be cured, right?", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

It was always \"your music.\" And she's not ever gonna be interested. \"That's so whiny.\" \"What an annoying voice.\" You get the idea.\n\nIf the song was not the Bain of her existence there would be a generic \"that's relaxing\" comment.

He said a lot of bad things about his exes in general. He told me they were abusive, so I thought he was just blaming himself and had low self-esteem. I felt bad for him. And it really made me want to help him and make him feel better. It also gave me a lot of anxiety because I felt like I had to be perfect to prove to him I'm not like his exes.\n\nWell, he was right, he did end up doing \"something dumb\", he cheated, or at least tried to. When we broke up I asked him why he did that. He just replied with \"Because I'm stupid and flawed\" and then changed the topic. He also started to gaslight me about a few things, and said that he had warned me.\n\nSo was that just a tactic to get me to have sympathy with him? Or did he just say that so he could blame me for not listening to him? Does he actually believe he's a bad person?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We have 2 little kids together.\n\nYesterday after dealing with red flags popping up in my intuition I checked his phone. Sure enough, yup hes messaging other women. Asking one to go for dinner and coffee. Another asking to role play with costumes. Exchanging hearts and stupid emojis with another. Making plans behind my back like crazy. I should also mention that he is currently unemployed and broke af, I'm supporting him, so presumably he was using my money to fund his activities. This isnt the first time I've seen such things but this time something was different. I didnt feel angry, I felt almost redeemed. \n\nWhen I calmy confronted him and announced the end of our relationship he flew into a rage. He threatened to kill me. He ripped the closet door off the wall and threw it across the living room. He said I'd better not leave the house or he would cave my head in. He cornered me up against the wall and punched the wall next to my head. I just stayed quiet and went into the bedroom with our children while he continued to tear the house apart and once he finally left I locked all the doors, cleaned up, and carried on with my day. Went to the gym and got a good work out. Not a single year was shed. \n\nSomething feels different this time. He was texting me giving me shit for going through his phone. He tried to put it all back on me. Then when that wasn't working he told me it was a joke and he was messaging those people to see what kind of funny responses he could get. That he wasn't doing anything. That I've pushed him away for the last time. Ok...\n\nSomething feels different this time. I think it really is over and I'm pretty sure he was out back last night as we were all sleeping as the dog was going crazy but he stopped messaging me after saying he was abandoning the children and it's all my fault. Of course I'm feeling guilty. If I hadn't looked he would be here right now. I know the hardest emotions come days after not hearing from him and that's when I start begging for him back. But I think after 5 years, I finally reached my limit. The constant mind games, the belittling, the cheating, it's over. I'm free to move on with my life.

Now she has put the idea in my head that he is a narcissist, so I'm all around a mess. \n\nWHAT HAPPENED: We had only been officially dating for 1.5 months. I would have NEVER seen this coming. We were good, yes maybe I was working a lot, but we were fine... this was supposed to be the honeymoon phase. We got really close, really fast (apparently that's a red flag). Things that have me believe he might be dangerous are the facts of his past: got a girl pregnant when he was 15, got fired from his job because he was interacting with one of the interns (but he was also an intern soooo fuzzy line there, she had just graduated high school, he told me he liked the taboo..., and this was who he had an affair with.... also they were previous fwb), he always seeks affirmation, constant love bombing? (but like how do you know the person isn't just being nice..?? I told him, that I need more reassurance so now he's always telling me all of these feelings he has for me), his dad cheated on his mom (really fucked up childhood), and most importantly... I told him how much honesty meant to me on our first date (I had previously been cheated on).\n\nWHY I GOT BACK WITH HIM: After a couple weeks of grieving, I decided to move forward and try and make things work with him. He confessed (a narc wouldn't do that right?), he told me every detail to make sure there was no trickle truth, he owned up to the two affairs. He owned up to cheating on three of his previous gfs (proclaimed he's never confessed and this is the first time he's seen it as something he needs to work on). HE was the one that called himself a serial cheater. HE was the one that decided to go to therapy and has been going since July (he now just cut it down to bi-weekly). He gave me access to his social media accounts, he's offered full transparency. He apologizes, he apologized while I was \"sleeping\" the other night. He cries. We always discuss things maturely. He talked to me about how his past has made him feel, he talks about his current feelings, he's not afraid to show vulnerability. He's been taking the criticism well, never defensive, always forgiving. He honestly seems to be very angry with himself.\n\nLeaving out a lot of emotions. Is it actually crazy to think he wants to change?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I did not diagnose him on my own, he has several times over the years told me his issues and that he suspects he is, but refuses to get treatment for it. Sometimes he has periods of clarity where he doesn't seem disordered at all, but most of the time he slips into it along with all the typical somatic behaviors that come with it.\n\nI've been working on myself to erect boundaries and extract myself from the relationship and I'm in a much better position than I was before, but I still slip up and get involved with him again.\n\nThe entire two years we've been \"together\" (I say that loosely because we could barely go 3 months without him vanishing without a trace, before resurfacing again several weeks later.) he would triangulate me with three specific women. I never met these women, nor did I know them, but he would give me context clues such as where they lived, what they did for a living, etc. Whenever he and I were on the \"outs\", he'd invariably let it be known to me that he was with one of these women.\n\nHe is a businessman and splits his time pretty equally between 3 cities. Long story short, and unfortunately I can't give all the details here because they are too specific, but I accidentally found out, unexpectedly, that all 3 of these \"women\" he's been talking about are actually all the same person, and that person is a gay man. There is a plethora of information about this person available online. This person also lives in, works in, and regularly travels to the exact same cities that my ex-bf spends time in for work. In fact, they used to live less than a mile away from each other. All the details match, age, career(s) (he has more than one and they all match each of these mythical women he's told me about), living and working location, 100% the conclusion is that all these women he's told me about is actually just a gay male he's been seeing.\n\n**Further, I've drawn the conclusion that their relationship pre-dates ours and that I'm likely the \"side\" person in the equation here, and this man is his primary relationship. Again, I can't go into the details without seriously risking their privacy but this nearly for certain is the case.**\n\nI really don't know what to think. I'm in a state of shock. He has several gay male friends, one of his work partners is gay, he seems comfortable in his sexuality and being masculine or feminine, so I'm surprised he feels the pressure to be in the closet. I am so confused! I'm oscillating between sadness for him that he feels he has to hide this big secret, but I also wonder if this is just how pwNPD are, they don't care where supply comes from as long as it's supply? This \u2018other wo-man\u2019 is clearly good supply. Semi - famous, intellectual, beautiful, essentially a younger v 2.0 of himself.\n\nI'm not mad. I'm not going to call him out. I\u2019m not going to confront. But I have no idea what to do or say or think now. I spent all night bawling, partly out of sadness, partially relieved for having an answer to this weirdness, finally, but now I feel numb and I need to talk to someone about this. If I stuff this inside of me and move on without discussing this with someone, I'm afraid I'm going to end up falling into a depression of this whole charade of a relationship that I stupidly hoped would still somehow work out in the end. I just need to get this out.\n\nI haven't said anything and won't. We're not on speaking terms as of yesterday, which is also when I found out.

Thank God I finally found a group that understands my struggles! I recently learned that most of my cluster-B wife's argument tactics are classic gaslighting. I had never heard of it before but holy shit does she check ALL the boxes! I feel like a new man now that I can see what is going on. For years I have been questioning my own sanity and even reality.  I have dipped a little into codependency I fear, but most of that is due to her love bombs being just what the DR ordered after withholding sex from me for 6weeks at a time. This will be the hardest thing for me to overcome. I know it sounds juvenile, but I need sex regularly and I can't bring myself to cheat on her. I suspect she has cheated before, but there is no glaring proof.\n\nAfter our last argument (which is just like every argument) I told her that I finally figured out what it is that she does to make me so frustrated and angry. She reeeeeeally wants to know, but I told her I don't feel safe telling her. You see, EVERY time we argue she talks about divorce. Basically I can't disagree with her without her threatening to leave me, and subsequently ruining our three kids lives. This has caused a barrier that she recognizes and tries to use to control me further.\n\nShe immediately started describing how all of my \"deep seated issues\" are preventing us from having a normal marriage. How \"EVERYONE knows I have problems\".  I almost started laughing in her face. This shit used to make me angry and I would yell, a lot. Now I see it for what it is and I'm loving it! Just sat there plain faced, not mad, not arguing, just waiting for my turn to speak. Wow did that piss her off! She completely lost it, and told me later that the conversation made her face break out so \"don't ask why I'm giving you the silent treatment\" LMAO! So far since then its been the good old silent treatment(which also used to infuriate me). \n\nHere is where my denial is still strong :( I have not been able to convince myself that she has been gaslighting on purpose. Her father, Mother, and at least one Grandparent all do/did it. Looking back, her issues with her father make perfect sense now. I am hoping that some day I can gently show her what she has been doing to me for the past 15years. I don't expect an apology, I know better, she has never made a real apology for ANYTHING. \n\nI do feel a very strong power shift happening soon though!

He claimed he \"loved both of [us] equally\" but was too scared to tell either of us yet.\n\n* Defends his opinions to an almost rabid extent, completely hardline in his brand of ancom philosophy.\n\n* Acts patronizingly with regards to my appearance and personality, frequently opting for condescending terms of endearment like \"cute little fellow,\" \"sweetie,\" or \"buddy.\" \n\n* Makes jokes about various aspects of me, usually with a lighthearted appearance.\n\n* Treats me as an errand boy, always asking me to write fanfics or search things up just for him. The few times I couldn't finish one of these errands for him, he continued to pester me to power through it.\n\n* Regularly showed me hardcore porn without me even asking.

This may take an eternity to explain but I'll try my best. I am currently 27, working as a teacher, living a semi-normal life. I have Borderline Personality Disorder which presents many challenges. I'm a survivor of many things, namely as you can guess, abuse.\n\nI was a freshman in high school when I entered an abusive relationship. I was the new kid trying to find my way and unexpectedly a boy was interested me. One that I found to be pretty funny, charming, and well-liked. But I was most definitely wrong about all of those things. He was in every way abusive but I also struggled to reconcile it with the fact that he also has a mental illness. In ways I try to block out, honestly.\n\nAfter a year and a half I finally broke it off. He was shocked. I was also in disbelief that I was finally making my move. It was hard, but not because I missed him, but because I relived everything and had night terrors constantly. I was pretending like nothing happened, he was telling people I was a horrible person, and I was going to therapy as usual to deal with all of my emotions.\n\nUnexpectedly, a few weeks later I found myself falling in love with his best friend, who just so happened to be one of my closest friends from the beginning. I felt incredibly guilty getting between them, but I also felt like I deserved to be happy after all the horrible shit he did to me. So his best friend and I tried dating in secret and when he found out, he painted me like a villain and everyone started to really hate me.\n\nI tried telling my friend who had just become my boyfriend about the abuse. I struggled and choked on my words, but they wouldn't come out. I played it off like a joke and never spoke of it again. I couldn't possibly make him lose his best friend, I thought, despite the fact that he was horrible to me. We continued to date and it got really serious, but ultimately my mental illness and PTSD started manifesting itself. He dumped me and I started to plan how I was going to end my life.\n\nThe last year of high school was not the best. I watched my two exes walk down the hallway laughing with each other and the majority of my friends left. I was pretty alone for the most part, save for a few really good friends. I applied to colleges away from home and tried my best to turn off that part of myself in order to survive.\n\nI go to college, start getting really bad night terrors, and tell someone about the abuse for the first time. It was so hard to vocalize it and I couldn't even believe that it was coming out of my mouth. I sat down my friends from home to tell them and it didn't end well. Most of the women believed me, but the men took it as a joke. They told my abusive ex about it and he confronted me. He said that it never happened and that I lied to all of his friends when I told them about our relationship. In all honesty, I don't think he believes he ever did anything wrong. He has no self-concept and is completely delusional about who he is and what he's done.\n\nI get in the last word, pretty much saying only God can judge him now so he can fuck right off. I entered a relationship with my now-fianc\u00e9 and we struggled really hard. I started seeing more borderline symptoms and my PTSD was so bad that I accidentally got startled and hurt him a couple of times. I was on the same verge of depression and anxiety and it weighed on him so, so much. Honestly bless him for sticking around.\n\nAnyway, so I went to my five-year high school reunion and encountered both exes. I found out that my abusive ex is in a serious relationship. I met her. I kept my cool entirely even though every fiber in my being wanted to strangle him. I wondered if he was abusing her too and didn't know if I should say anything. I figured not because there was no way she would have believed me anyway.\n\nI wrote a letter to my other ex basically apologizing for being a fire-breathing dragon when we dated and when he dumped me. I told him I was really sorry for the messed up shit that I did and that it wasn't okay. I let him know that I also needed to get off my chest that his best friend was abusing me and it triggered the mental illness I now have. He never responded.\n\nTwo years later and my abusive ex and his girlfriend got engaged. I'm not upset that he's getting married but more so that I don't know what's happening to her and that my other ex is going. I feel sick to my stomach thinking about my former friends going and supporting him. The fact that my ex is going to be at his wedding is crushing me. I always thought better of him. But I also don't know what he's going through either.\n\nSo the wedding is this Saturday and I am actually planning on going out to some bars with some girl friends this weekend. I figured surrounding myself with people that love me would help soften the blow. I honestly am severely disappointed in my ex for going to my abusive ex's wedding. I would guess he's also going to be his best man. It is crushing me. All I want to do is cry and yell and scream. I'm just extremely hurt, even though I know that I've grown so much and my recovery has actually been going really well. I honestly just don't know how to feel nor how to express myself right now. Anyone relate to at least some of this? LOL.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He would bring his sisters in to defend his verbal abuse, reminding me that English is not his first language and in their culture this is normal. I just need to be patient with him and not push his buttons. I now know this is typical gaslighting. \n\nAfter I shared all this with the therapist, she created a safety/escape plan. She also recommended that I speak with someone from our local women's advocacy center. She explained what I already know, but have a hard time accepting: The chance that he is going to get better is almost zero and the abuse is most likely going to get worse. I need to find a way to leave. She recommended I remain no contact or as little contact as possible.

I'll try to keep this short - we used to work together in a small team, starting dating, I left the job early this year but I am still in the same industry. The first year of the relationship (2018) was brilliant. We explored the city and spent virtually all our time together (I am not from this city, but still working here. He is). I went on a holiday to visit a friend in December and he started to call and text me incessantly and there was name calling involved (you pscycho/you don't love me/etc). I've noticed a lot of other things since:\n\n\\- every fight would take place over text messages (that he would inadvertently start over the weekend because he's home doing nothing) and ten minutes in, he would say 'fine, lets break up then'\n\n\\- he once screamed at me quite violently because of continuing to speak to a mutual friend and male coworker we both were close with and making me so uncomfortable over the whole thing that him and I aren't friends anymore. They still are and routinely hang out together pretending like nothing ever happened \n\n\\- after he walked out mid-conversation in a crowded mall, he proceeded to kick his musical equipment and upturn his suitcase and throw a fit until I gave in and had to help him out of it\n\n\\- I would walk on eggshells around him so as to not upset him when he's already in a bad mood and it would inadvertently end up with me being screamed at \n\n\\- From June this year, there has been steady emotional and verbal abuse, breaking into my Instagram to unblock himself and read conversations that are about him, threatening to come to my workplace and home, calling on my work landline after I blocked him on my phone, violent screaming, calling from random numbers, texting from his mother's phone, parking under my apartment complex for hour and crying after having abused me (so the crying somehow absolves him of what he'd just done) and a lot of other things I am perhaps missing out.\n\nDespite blocking him in every possible manner, having changed jobs and moved houses since June, we unfortunately still ran into each other at two work events this month following which we had a meal together. of course in a matter of days, the abuse picked up again.\n\nHe's undergone significant trauma in his childhood that stands unresolved in my opinion that he expected for the love to cure or override. I have had a damaging childhood too but it's not something I expect anyone else to 'cure'. He knows I have low self-esteem and a crippling impostor syndrome. He says debilitating things about me, telling me that I was never present in the relationship, and used him, and I got what I wanted and I am done now. He says he is the true victim because I am a heartless person that has just moved on while he so deeply loves me and wanted to marry me and still does. He says I wasted his life and ruined his life with my mental health issues (I have anxiety, but it's never manifested to anything that would affect him). That I pushed him to use abusive language and it's so unlike him and that I bring it out in him and now I am making him into a monster he's not because I love watching him suffer. That he loved me unconditionally but I only cared about myself and not our future together. Sometimes I begin to believe so many of these things. He's texting me a version of this as I type. He cries so aggressively after he abuses me or does something awful and says that I caused it. \n\nIt's all taking a toll on my mental health. In these months, I also got an immediately lost a wonderful job (they decided to abruptly close the office in my country), had to move out of a home with a mentally abusive flatmate and my only 2 friends have left the country. So I am alone all the time now and constantly terrified of him. I unblocked him the two times we accidentally met at work events and regretted it in a matter of days when he started to question me over and over again about why I did all this. \n\nI recently read that emphatic people are easy preys for emotionally abusive people because they know you will put them first or at least try to always be there for you.

Eventually I dropped out. Got a GED and went to nursing school. Seems ever relationship I've been in has been abusive.\n\nFirst \"marriage\" I married the guy to help him with a forgery charge. He and his lawyer said he'd get probation if he was married. We weren't supposed to stay married and he'd agreed to pay for the divorce. I was 19 he 18 at the time. Well that got all messed up. Somehow our mothers found out. Gave me a damn wedding shower. About a week after the wedding he asked me did I want to make this a real marriage. Uhhh no. Not long after he started beating me. I'd leave, but he'd beg me to come back with flowers, candy and tears. I kept going back. The last beating he just started hitting me. No reason. A big guy pulled him off me and the house owner got his gun. I called my parents, mom took me to the police station. The cops showed me pictures of women who's husbands had beat then to death. They told me I would look like that after he killed me. I filed charges and he went to prison.\n\nAt 29 years old I met my son's father. I was an LPN and in school for RN. He's a pharmacist who was getting a PhD in chemistry. He didn't start out beating me. But the signs were there, I chose to ignore them. My friend told me what a jerk he is and asked me not to marry him. I told her she didn't really know him, that he's nice. I was wrong. I got pregnant. It was high risk. Couldn't work but I did get paid 75% of my wages for disability. When I was first taken off work he told me not to bank on him taking care of the baby. I was devastated. Worried sick about the pregnancy, couldn't work and just really emotional from the pregnancy. Being on bedrest and wanting to give my baby the nutrients he needed I gained a lot of weight. He was totally unsupportive. Even making very rude comments about my body. We were not supposed to be having sex. One night he raped me.\n\nI had our son by c-section. He came into the recovery room, threw a heavy phone on my abdomen and yelled at me about why haven't I called my parents. Ouch! A day or so later I was tryna to learn to breast feed. My breasts were engorged. The nurse who came in to teach me was a float nurse. She said it would be impossible for me to breast feed because my nipples were too big. They were engorged with milk. He came in after and told me I couldn't breast feed because I had nipples like a pig.\n\nHe didn't buy our baby food, diapers, toiletries, nothing. He did buy a crappy breast pump and a baby scale. He wanted me to pump my breasts and feed him that way. When I did try to breast feed him, he would stand over me staring and making rude comments. He also wanted me to weigh the baby, feed him then weigh him again so he could see how much milk the baby got! I finally just gave up on breast feeding. I went back to work on my surgical unit 5 weeks after giving birth. \n\nAbout two years later I'd finally finished my prerequisites and entered the LPN to RN program. He'd insisted we'd be there long enough for me to finish it. A week into the program he told me get my tuition back that we were moving for his program. Also that he wasn't going to be working outside the lab so I'd have to work more. I took a test to get into a fast track LPN to RN  program. I got the position but had to turn it down because I had to work so much and had a two year old. While we were there he got his US citizenship. He didn't tell me, I found it when I was cleaning. He said it wasn't important.\n\nHe finished his program and got a job in a lab in Delaware. Think it would be easier on me with him making more money? Hell to the no. He made three times as much money as me but I had to pay so many bills, I couldn't keep up with the money. He'd started out paying the utilities, one day the electric company came to shut ours off. He hadn't paid the bill! Soon after he told me I had to pay that bill. I also had to buy all the food, the utilities, my car insurance, our sons copays for medical, any meds our son needed, and do all the house work. I felt like a slave in my own home. He stopped talking to me and when I'd ask him what I'd done he would respond I'm too stupid to talk to. He didn't want me to have any friends and definitely not have anyone in our home, which he said was his home. Without my knowledge he'd been taking out loans from his credit Union and signing my name to them. He also bought a huge refrigerator on my credit card, said he'd pay for it and made no payments. Shot my credit to hell. After several years of this with me working 12-16 hour shifts he decided he wanted a divorce. And if I didn't move out he'd move out with our child and not tell me where he was! This is legal in Delaware if there's no custody order in place. I moved. Was in and out of psych hospital cuz it caused a \"nervous breakdown\". Finally I couldn't work anymore. The court told him to rent me an apartment. That took months with me couch surfing. Then he was ordered to pay interim alimony. He didn't pay me for 5 months, took him to court and the threat of jail forced him to write the check. He was supposed to give me one of the cars. He refused. I finally went to the house with the court order and the police and got the car. Since I couldn't work, I couldn't pay rent. Didn't think I could get food stamps. I did. My doctor got me on disability. That felt like a slap in the face.\n\nHe did everything he could to keep our son away from me. I had to move into an apartment in the city where I had a room mate. There was no way for my son to spend his days with me at my home. That relationship suffered greatly. I was constantly having to take his father back to family court. He had his wages garnished for my alimony payments.\n\nThere is so much more... But I think I made my point. It's been 20 years. I have PTSD, anxiety and depression. Numerous suicide attempts. I had been cutting myself so there are scars all over me. For anyone in an abusive relationship, please read what I wrote. Get out of it while you can. I wish someone had told me what could happen to me and our son. I had to learn the hard way. I'm still on disability, never was able to work as a nurse again. I'm over 65 now and I think this is going to plague me the rest of my life. Abuse comes in many forms. Physical, mental, emotional, psychological, sexual, financial...

Cognitive empathy, which is being able to understand the perspectives of others. Emotional empathy, which is sharing in the emotion someone else displays. i.e. if someone is happy and pleasant, it influences the others mood. And compassionate empathy, which is feeling the pain of others.\n\nMy nex would claim, frequently, that she was an empath, however, she could not understand the perspectives of others, she would often get jealous of people who were happy, and she seemed quite joyful in witnessing pain unless she could display her increased value by giving someone a shoulder to cry on.\n\nHer definition of empathy was more in line with being psychic. Her claim as an empath validated her rage quite often, as she would say that she knew the intents of others. This could be something as simple as sending her a text telling her goodmorning. If it woke her up, she would claim that the intent was to do so, which led to a whole session of accusations about not caring about her feelings. Despite just being happy to talk to her.\n\nShe would often blame her status as an empath for anxiety, claiming when she walked into a room, there were just too many different emotions for her to function. This anxiety, would validate any reactions she had, including rage, showboating, interrupting people, whatever careless action she chose to take.\n\nAny apologies offered to her after an argument would be claimed to be false, which meant she did not need to apologize. Often, an apology would just infuriate her. Even when the apologies were for something like saying \"good morning\" before she wanted to hear it.\n\nUltimately, it seemed like she treated projection as if it was empathy. Maybe I'm misunderstanding what it is to be empathic, but I don't think it allows you to claim to know someone's internal thought.\n\nYes, with communicative cues such as body language, you can often tell when someone is actually being a jerk behind kind words, but it's not really a product of empathy as much as observation and subconscious analysis, and her interpretation (with me at least) was often incorrect. It was almost like she was angry, and so she'd hear or read everything through that lens. If she was having a bad day, telling her \"I really hope your day gets better\" was seen as A) telling her what to do, and B) trying to rub it in her face how shitty her day already was.\n\nDid anyone else's nex utilize \"being an empath\" to validate their projections of their own feelings onto others?

Mother blames abuse on me and tells me to be grateful for the abuse.", "author": "snoreweezy", "self_text": "I am a 40yo Female.\n\nI remember being a sweet child, obedient, playful, A-student and loved being at home in the company of my younger brothers and pets. The oldest of four children. Upper-middle-class home. Dad was the provider, mom stayed at home. We had maids and a chauffeur. Pet dogs and cats. Sent to private schools. We lived a comfortable life but it was not an extravagant existence. Our needs were met. But even then, as a child, deep down I knew, that something was off, wrong, or didn't make sense.\n\nThe physical abuse began at adolescence and persisted to early adulthood. The abuse ranged from heavy back-handed slaps, belt whippings using the buckle, to full-on beatings where I would be dragged by my hair and kicked and punched around. There was also plenty of verbal abuse and mental abuse, constantly getting berated and criticized for simply being in the same space with him. He went on this \"academic rage\" and bought me all the math books he could find and forced me to memorize multiplication/division, etc. tables. All tears, it was miserable. He always found something \"wrong\" and he had to just make a big deal out of it, and in the process, I think he riled himself up to a point where he had to act out his rage on me, and therefore I got beat. I got criticized for the way I looked (I was getting \"fat\" when in fact, my lanky preteen frame started getting curves bcoz: adolescence), I got criticized for how I said words when I led the daily evening rosary, I got criticized for -- despite having good grades, being a good student and active in a lot of extracurricular goings-on at school -- not graduating at the top of my class. He refused to attend my grade school graduation and my high school graduation. They were not happy memories. For both events, my dad acted out the same way: I remember him lecturing me for being a poor student, arguing with my mom about not wanting to attend the graduation, making the drive to the school uncomfortable for everyone in the car, being quiet at my graduation, not applauding me as I came up to get my diplomas, rushing to get back home (he wouldn't let me talk to my classmates and their parents), and ignoring me for days.\n\nIn all that time, my mother never talked to me to comfort or hug me. She just watched, I remember. Never said a comforting word or a hug after any act of abuse. Never stood between me and my dad. In the movies, there's this archetypal protective mother that fought back at her child's abuser. That was not her. There were plenty of days when I thought she simply didn't care.\n\nI remember one day when my dad beat me so bad that I almost passed out from the physical pain and mental anguish. I was probably 14 or 15. I forgot why he started beating me. He was mad about something, and again I was in his space and I took the abuse. The beating started at the landing of the stairs, and he dragged me all the way to the master bedroom where he locked the door and continued to kick, punch, slap, yell. The works. When it was over, he let me out, I ran into my room, locked the door and didn't come out until dinner time. After the beating, my mom came around back, peered into my bedroom window (my bed was next to the window) and said: \"I wish you had just stayed quiet. This is all your fault.\"  At that moment, I knew that my mother would never, ever put herself between me and anything that endangered me. She never took my side. In all the years of abuse, she never confronted my father nor made it clear to him to never hurt me again.\n\nThe beatings continued on for 10 more years until I reached a point of desperation. I was living at home, had a full-time job and going to community college. Both were great excused to not be home, but I was still within his reach. I decided enough was enough and moved out of the house as soon as I turned 21. It was, to this day, one of the best decisions I have ever made for myself.\n\nMy parents divorced when I was 24. I did seek therapy on and off for a few years. However, as a result of the trauma I admit that I have trust and anger issues. It took me years of self-work to calm the hurting child within. At 40, I am a much gentler version of who I was in my 20s and 30s. I've mellowed out a lot, and put everything behind me.\n\nFast forward to last August when my mother and I traveled to attend my grandfather's funeral. While sitting in the car in middle of traffic, and out of nowhere, my mother told me that I should be grateful to God for all the abuse that has ever happened to me. She said the abuse was worth it, because here we are today, free from it.\n\nI was stunned. I teared up a little. I don't know what to make of it.\n\nMy mother is the opposite of my father. She is gentle and kind, religious, conservative, and very image-conscious, even to this day. Sometimes I think she let the abuse happen because she had some kind of end goal. Somehow I think she saw me as the convenient sacrificial lamb of the family. She was low-key abused by my father too, but it really feels like I was her ticket out of her misery. Why did it take her so long to pull us out of that situation? Financially, my mother had the upper hand--her family was tight-knit and had money so they could have easily pooled resources to rescue us then. But she never told them anything that was going on in her family, so naturally, the news of their divorce came as a huge shock to everyone.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read all this rambling, but her statement has been bothering me for a couple of months now and I have lost sleep over it. I don't want to start a conflict with my mother, but I want to process my thoughts too. I also want to gently explain and make her understand that any abuse is not okay and any abuse is not a gift. Please help me make sense of all of this, and if anyone has ever been in a similar situation, I want to know how you rose above it. And feel free to AMA.\n\nThank you in advance for your support and acceptance.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Of lamenting, mourning, reading, flashbacks, analyzing. \nI got hoovered.\nI also couldn't  let go.\nAt first I hated the idea of \"addiction\". We feel love because we are conned for goodness sake. Lied to. That's not addiction. However, it was clear it was an unhealthy trauma bond almost from the start. He wasn't physically bad ( at least to me). He also showed altruism ( because he needed constant adoration). Now I do see it as addiction and withdrawal. \nHe coudn't keep it up...this false self. He cheated on me from the start. After three years and at a seemingly calm period I was discarded in the most horrific way. I am ashamed to say I let myself get hoovered-in 3 times. But I needed that proof. That closure. He is charming. We had good chemistry. He is despicable. I think possiby pure evil. There is a reason no one in his family are in contact except  his parents and even they are distant. \n\nAs my mental and physical health improved this last year  so did my self esteem.\nI so much wanted him to redeem himself even a teeny bit. I didn't want to buy into all the narc literature. \nWell...\nHe proved it all correct. He did despicable things but not before trying to keep me on a hook even after another poor woman moved into his house madly in love thinking she had found her fantasy saviour. He needed a housekeeper to be under his control and in his bed. I was living in my own house. \n\nAnd this evening after one last demeaning communication the penny fell finally. I felt physically sick. I could feel my skin crawl. Suddenly all the evil things lined up in my mind hitherto repressed. He was truly an addiction because even after I saw he was not right I found it hard to cut him off. \nNow it happened. I see it clearly. I feel this deep set disgust at all the things I tried to explain away, defend. I am ashamed I didn't notice more his neglect towards his kids. Right now I am wondering if he sexually assaulted his daughter but I'm probably over-shooting it a bit. What a reaction I have right now ! I am shaking.  Truly skin crawling and nausea. Why did it take sooo long? Why did I waste so much energy on him even after the discard.\nPlease can anyone relate? Is this just another loop I shall go through. Will I return to trying to redeem him like the brain of an addict affected by a con man who made me feel I was deeply in love.\nI tried compassion. Didn't work. I just found myself trying to hoover HIM back , only to be shown again what a despicable man he is. He knows I'm onto him so uses clever sick manipulation. \nHis ex wife said he was a psychopath. He said that she was. \nHis ex gf sent me quora articles about narcissism. He said she was mentally unstable.\nI'm sure that is what he says about me.\nI think he should be locked up. He is dangerous. I was close to suicide after the discard and I am not crazy unstable weak person. He is a con man.\nIt took a whole year but I got my head free. He is poison.

I will try to keep it short. \n\nBeen with my man for 13 years. We have 3 children together. All under 10. I've known for a very long time the relationship wasnt quite right, but I've never been able to break it off. Hes just so great when hes not being mean... you know?\n\nIn the past years, some behaviour I've experienced is:\n\n- being treated like a child. He berates me for mistakes, and wont let them go. He needs me to learn my lesson. Like a 5 year old. He also does this to our kids. Big things, little things, it doesnt matter. \n\nHe glares at me. It sounds like a small thing, but it's so menacing. \n\nHe is Jekyll and Hyde. I never know which version I am going to get. \n\nWhen I stand up to him, he is an expert at turning it back around and making it my fault. I'm not loving enough, present enough, he does all the housework, I am critical of him. Etc. These things are complete exaggerations. BUT there is enough truth in his statements that it takes the wind out of my sails, and I go back to thinking I can try harder and things will get better. \n\nI am never good enough, but when I try to do things his way, it's only a matter of time before the goal posts move... \n\nOne habit that I find particularly awful (aside from my children! I know my children are the most important thing)... I have a baby. When he wakes up in the night, I get extremely anxious and try to calm him before his dad wakes up. And he often does wake up. When he does, he is so angry with the way I am dealing with the baby. It's all wrong. I am not doing the right things. Why is that childs show on? Its 2 am! Did he fall off the couch?? As if I am the cause of the crying child... I am more concerned with him coming upstairs and giving my trouble than I am with comforting my baby. \n\nSo. I know this is abuse. I also own my part in putting up with it, and my own shortfalls. But lately I've just felt done. I need some thoughts. \n\nHow can I leave his situation with 3 children? I have a job and my family would take me in until I can get on my feet. But what are the practical steps to leaving? Do I need to sit him down and explain? Do I just leave and blindside him? I dont know the steps to take here. I know i need to have primary custody of our kids, and I need to get out before my kids are beyond repair. It's not fair for them to watch their father constantly disrespect and demean their mother. And his angry tangents often extends to them. \n\nHe doesnt hit us. But I often wish he would so that I could have a concrete event to point at after I leave. Somethig he cant argue with! (Or something he couldn't twist around and have me believe it.) \n\nSo. Practical steps to leaving? Advice? Help?\n\nSorry I'm on my lunch break and dont have much time to write. But I am worried that my resolve is fragile. I worry that I'll just become complacent again, and go back to sleep. I'm trying to stay angry.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

To be honest he whinged about all my friends, but this one in particular, he would put her down and make fun of her relationship with her boyfriend. It definitely tainted our friendship and made me feel bad about myself because he would say things like she has no one else to talk to in this town, so she has to talk to you. \n\nBut sadly she had the same power over me that my Nex did. For example I was her bridesmaid and 2 days before the wedding she messaged me Nex and said That she would give him a list of people he could talk to because I would be busy all day with her, and she needed my undivided attention. Which wasn\u2019t true because once the ceremony and photos were done she was with her husband for the rest of the night. The other bridesmaid was free to be with her partner. (But fortunately they don\u2019t have that power of me anymore and out of my life, NC from both for 9 months with both trying hoovering attempts) \n\nBut there was something possessive about both of them when it came to me. It was like I had to choose between them constantly. Looking back it amplified both their narcissistic behaviours, which would make me feel confused, stressed and unhappy. \n\nI know they were both toxic relationships, but I\u2019m wondering if anyone else has had the same experience??", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The entire evening is pretty much spend discussing his life, when I do talk about myself his replies are not very reciprocal. Sometimes his replies even come off as if he is a little annoyed. However, I'm getting the familiar feeling \" could this all just be in my head? Am I reading too much into things?\" I want to say no, but it feels like all signs are pointing to yes.  \n\n\nThis is the second time in a row where I feel like he's intentionally triggered me by placing his hand over my neck. Something I've expressed to him not to do. This was discussed before we started being intimate because it's a major concern of mine and he knows it's due to a result of a violent sexual assault in my past where the person among other things choked me.   \nWe've known each other for a few years now &amp; have been hooking up on &amp; off for them without much issue. However, more recently I've tried confronting him (all of 3 times) about some inappropriate conduct &amp; was met with the usual dismissive tactics for the most part. Although a letter experience resulted in us both agreeing to terms, him asking me to \"not think the worst of him\", even though I didn't feel that way, never expressed as such, &amp; simply told him something he did hurt my feelings. With narcs it always seems to be the end of the world if anyone has feelings that aren't positive towards them. I feel like it's all in my head, but I haven't been triggered like this in such a long time, &amp; since confronting him, both time's we've hooked up he's taken this action. The first time he brought his hand close to my neck I just brushed his hand away figuring he'd forgotten but unfortunately it resulted in a break down. He seemed cool with it &amp; just commented that I was triggered &amp; asked if I needed anything from him.  \nI didn't explain to him what it was that triggered me as it wasn't something he'd done in a very long time &amp; just thought it was a one off experience...\n\nThe second time in a row time  was much more intent filled on his part, I pulled his hand away &amp; before I could say anything he said \"Oh no, i didn't mean for it to be a choking thing\"...  \n\n\nWho said ANYTHING about choking? I didn't. I didn't express previously &amp; I didn't even have a chance to say anything before the words leaped out of his mouth this time... I didn't confront him as at that point I was panicking &amp; literally scared. I should have left but ended up sleeping with him as I was scared he'd become more angry and/or kick me out in the middle of the night. There is always this vibe some level of sexual contact is expected between us when we spend time together. I should have just gotten up &amp; left, I made excuses in my mind. It's all in my head, it's the middle of the night &amp; you can't really afford a cab home. It's freezing out &amp; the buses aren't running  &amp; it's a 45 minute walk home at least.

He made fun of me pouring my feelings out by comparing me to a textbook and he said it with a laugh. He then went back into his intense \u2018venting\u2019 voice. \n\nI\u2019m scared to leave. I don\u2019t fear physical violence, as it\u2019s all emotional, but I fear being alone without him in my life. I fear starting over in a new relationship and how I could live without him in my life.

I\u2019m 23 and 38 weeks pregnant. I\u2019m due Nov 6th. This whole pregnancy has been terrible due to the man/boyfriend (soon to be ex)  that I\u2019m sharing my child with. I have so much to\ntell but I\u2019ll just write a few stories.\n\nMy life was going so good up until I met this man. I\u2019m a mother of a 7 year old, I was in school full time, working on my degree, worked part time, was paying my bills on time and passing all of my classes. Him and I started dating and I became pregnant not too long after. Finding out I was pregnant for the second time was one of the most scariest thing I\u2019ve had to deal with.\nAt the beginning of our relationship, everything seemed like a dream. I thought I had finally found somebody that really liked me and was such a sweetheart. Boy, was I deceived. I started to see red flags but I put them aside because I know nobody\u2019s perfect and I figured he would change. It started off with criticism about things that I wore \u201cmaybe you should wear this\u201d when I had a outfit picked out. Then he started to attack my personality (should have left then). I remember calling him crying about my mother and he called me needy for calling twice in a day. He also said, \u201cthere are far more worse things then your problems with your mother.\u201d Mind you my mother abandon my younger brother and I when I was younger, so it\u2019s a very touchy subject and I trusted him enough to share and he just gave me shit for it.\n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant, he tried to blame me for it. I was on birth control for the past two years and the reason it failed with him was because I was taking antibiotics that were prescribed from an Urgent Care (so not my actual doctor) and they weren\u2019t aware I was on BC. And I clearly wasn\u2019t aware ( I still blame myself though.) So I ended up pregnant but had no intentions on getting pregnant.\n\nSo many stories but I\u2019ll just cover some of\nthe things he does.\n\n- Everytime I express my feelings, concerns, etc, he always acts like they are not important.

Siblings and parents call me a \u2018liar\u2019 and act like this abuse did not affect them and I am crazy for even bringing it up. \n\nAs long as I remember, my dad constantly drank hard liquor and getting mad at my mom for the silliest things and then threatening her to leave us when he went on a rage. He would pack his things and then tell us he was living and would be back in a couple hours. He did it often to the point I feel I have abandonment issues because of this manipulation. I remember him beating us but specially me for spilling milk accidentally as a child, or not eating certain foods. We would go to my uncle\u2019s house and he would drink and drive us back home drunk arguing with my mom. My dad would always try to find something to pick on us and make us feel like dummies. My mom is him number one enabler and never did anything to stand up for us. He would leave my ass so red with belt marks and be bruised to the point my mom had to ice my ass. I remember he beat me one day for not letting my cousin borrow a movie. It seemed like he enjoyed just finding an excuse. My dad is also a chain smoker that ignores second hand dangers and always smoked around us even though he knew my brother had asthma and I have a live threatening illness that affects my lungs (CF). We would write him letter asking him to stop and he would ignore them. Till this day he drinks and smokes and now seems to have mental issues. Everyone in my family turns the other way and does not acknowledge he is mentally ill and an addict. \n\nWhen I was 13 my parents used to call me crazy because I started to stand up for my self and sisters when they use to beat us. My dad would throw me in the bed and with hit me with his hands or use a leather belt. They will call us bad words and make us cry so hard, we couldn\u2019t stop and throw us in a cold shower after. At 13, I defended my self I kicked my dad as hard as I could on his chest got up from the bed (while my mom just watched) and my sisters begging him to stop. I ran to get the landline phone to call 911 and he disconnected it fast enough for me not to dial out. I ran to my neighbor\u2019s house and asked her to let me in to use her phone. He followed me and told my neighbor I was just kidding, and I was just crazy. Then had to go back inside the house and of course beat me. During this episode I saw him push my mom against a wall (I had never seen him touch her before).\n\nThen my mom decided that I needed to go to therapy because I was acting out according to them and \u201crebelling\u201d against them. I started going to therapy and my parents would warm me not to say anything about the abuse or else they would go jail, and I would end up with no parents. I could never say anything to my psychologist. One day my dad had to join me in family therapy and the psychologist asked him to say something positive to me and he said he had nothing positive to say. Then he said I was the black sheep and then says he doesn\u2019t love me. My mom never stood up for me and always takes his side till this day. After the whole incident he would try to hit me, and I would defend my self and warm him that if he touched me, I would call the cops on him. Till this day he will always bring up that it is my fault for the way he treats me, since I tried to call the cops on him when I was 13. He holds so many grudges against me for standing up to his abuse. My mom always tried to cover, and she did care for us and it was always better when he is not around. As an adult he tried to hit me and kept warning him and he would cuss me out and put me down and call me a whore for having a bf at 21. In the past I have brought up these episodes to my siblings and even mom and they get all quit and my mom usually says I am lying and that I am messed up for telling lies. She claims to not remember and says they were great parents. \n\nMy mom constantly just talks so much shit about people and my siblings behind our backs. They are so negative. My dad spends time on the phone with cousins talking down on people. They have always criticize me for my strengths and for standing up for myself. \n\nBoth my parents are hardcore catholics and would take us to \u2018confessions\u2019 when I was a teen. One day I went to confess my self with a priest. Before I could start talking the priest started to ask me if I touched my self or watched porn. I got very scared and he asked me if I had a boyfriend. I said, \u2018yes I do\u2019 and he asked if I had sex with him and if so how. I was terrified and ran out crying and mad. I told my parents and they told me to shut my mouth and if anyone heard me say those lies, it would look bad on them.\n\nWhen I was a young adult my dad would live to family members and say he paid for my car, my auto insurance and phone bill, when I paid it all myself. Constantly lied and put me down in front of others, thinking he was funny.\n\nWhen I graduated college, I started to work and finally moved away. I felt pretty happy living away from them for 3 years. For some reason I always came back to visit my mom and sister. Not him but was always cordial with him. I got sick and lost my job and had to move back home, since they saw I was in a really bad situation. I am now living back at home with my abusers and negativity of 2 narcissists. It is hard because I am saving money to move again and stabilizing my self at my new job. My dad wants to control everything I do while I am here. He tells me to move my car and how to park. He gets mad if I don\u2019t say goodbye to him. Doesn\u2019t talk to me or communicate ever. If he has something to say he will say it under his breath or tell the messenger (my mom) to tell me. He acts like a 10-year-old with paranoia. He hoards a lot of things and thinks everyone is after him and trying to do harm. Always drinking and smoking at any time of the day. \n\nMy parents are so negative that I never ever heard them express nicely about someone. My mom is only happy if we give her money and if we don\u2019t, she starts complaining about everything and how we just use her for living at their house. I explained to her that this is not the ideal situation for me, and I will be out as soon as I am ready financially. They get mad at me if I come home late or if I decide to spend the night at my best friend\u2019s home. I always have t give an explanation and make them feel like they have some type of power over me. I get mad because I am 28 and a good person and they refuse to only focus on the negative and the PAST. Unfortunately, they live in the past and always bring things of the past. Never in the present moment.\n\nNow, I just want to hear feedback from this. Any words or advice are appreciated. Please don\u2019t say to move out, since this is not an option for me at this moment. Also, I would like to point out that I have tried to see psychologist to help me move forward or to forgive my parents. Unfortunately, none of the counseling has been of quality and have to pay out of pocket. If anyone is willing to offer psychological services for a low cost, I am happy to pay. I just need someone to hear me and tell me I didn\u2019t deserve this. Has anyone experienced people or parents like these? Thank you for reading : )", "subreddit": "abuse"}
{"post_id": "dmsj1a", "created_utc": 1571979302, "title": "My Story", "author": "collegesnail", "self_text": "Hi I'm AJ (F19). This is my story, a bit awkwardly written, but its written how I would tell it to a friend--and did tell it to a friend. Throughout therapy, I was told that sharing can help both myself and others. I want that, because even after all these years I am still struggling. From browsing this subreddit, I feel comfortable enough to share it with this community and hopefully find people I can relate to. That being said, here goes.\n\nAt the age of 11 I was taken into foster care. My father the few years before I was taken did some really disgusting things to me. I'll just put it simply as human sex trafficking, I don't want to go into detail; they were acts I don't think anyone wants to hear the details of. I don't remember a lot around that time, except my type 1 diabetes diagnosis, but in the past few years it has been coming back...A lot of medical neglect (he never took me to my appointments, most likely because they would see the state I was in) went on, and my father was an alcoholic and addict by that time, and he's honestly probably a socio or psychopath, but I don't know and I don't really care to.\n\nEven before that things had been rough, to say the least. My father had married this horrible woman (I'll just call her Rose), who would physically abuse myself and later my low-functioning brother, Michael, but not her daughter. This went on for years, and she even went so far as to refuse getting medical attention to my brother, who ended up needing stitches for his injuries, and not allowing him proper therapy for his autism. Around the age of eight, the two divorced, and she took Michael while my father took in a childhood friend of mine's whose own father had signed over rights. This is where we retrace to that last paragraph...that's where that all began. My diagnosis was in 2010, and if I hadn't been taken I probably would have died in that Hell.\n\nThen, a year later, all I can remember is waking up to policemen, my father nowhere to be found. I was clueless of what was happening; for some reason, I just could not even recall anything he did to me...I had been brainwashed to view my father as a great blessing. I seriously thought I would return to him, so the only things I brought were myself, and extra set of clothes and my pet rat, Ellie Mae. \n\nIt took so, so long to come out of my stupor. I truly believed my father did no wrong, the only thing I had been told he was convicted for were drugs. Nobody told me any different, and I didn't remember. I was quickly diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder and Dissociative amnesia, though I didn't realise this diagnosis until I was older and going through my case files with my wonderful therapist. It wasn't until I went through those files, however, that I began to remember. I was fifteen then, and it took almost a year...after four years of psychotherapy, these sessions were the first that what my father had done had been brought to light. Even now I struggle with the after effects of RAD--not acting appropriately in some situations or sometimes being unsympathetic when I should be--and still have quite a bit of amnesia.\n\nBut\n\nI am so, so grateful now. To be a survivor of something so brutal, something thousands of people also experience every single day. I got so, so lucky; I was adopted by a loving family in 2014 after only a short three years in foster care, and I've gotten to talk to and meet amazing people and hear their stories and share mine...I hope to be an advocate for victims of human trafficking and other abuses, because the topic is so taboo you can't talk about it openly like you would with many concerning subjects. I really want this to change; just because we don't openly acknowledge and speak about it, doesn't mean its not there. \n\nSo, that's my story, and the goal I have because of it. I hope people struggling with abuse can know it does--and will--get better, and if you take the time and apply yourself you can heal.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

There was no name-calling or devaluation.\n\nWhat there was, though, I THINK, was control, manipulation and dishonesty.\n\nI was completely bewitched by him when we met through mutual friends. Very striking man with a playful manner, relaxed demeanor and great style. We got together and several extremely intense months of love bombing followed. Phone calls, texting, future faking, \u201cyou are the love of my life\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this way about anyone before\u201d, \u201ccan we run away together?\u201d. (By the way, he is in a relationship - I know, I\u2019m a horrible person).\n\nSome of his early romantic conversation revolved around our genetic compatibility - we both have green eyes, and we pillow talked about having a baby verrrrry early on. He used to say he wanted people to see us walking together. I felt the same way.\n\nAfter a month or two, he seemed to put me through some tests. One day out of the blue, he was cold over the phone and then said he had to \u201cthink about us\u201d. This was bad timing for me, it came during a difficult period at work, but that didn\u2019t occur to him. I was beside myself and had to keep going to the bathroom to cry.\n\nA few weeks later, we had an emotional phone call while I was away with friends, because I hadn\u2019t been attentive enough to my phone. (This one sounds worse than it seemed at the time, he wasn\u2019t unkind, just seemed genuinely hurt and sad.)\n\nThings calmed down after that in all ways. We stopped having emotional talks. He\u2019d call me every day and talk at me about work. He\u2019s a generally positive, upbeat person but I did notice him complaining about others, his inept staff or his devious colleagues. He would also ask me about myself, and express encouragement and positivity about my friends, work etc. Always complimentary. But, he also became distant - barely writing, calling once a day at his convenience. He would seldom pick up when I rang him. Once, when he was going away on a week-long work trip and I knew we wouldn\u2019t speak much, I called him to say a quick goodbye before he got on the plane. He rejected the call. Neither of us mentioned this when he got back, but I decided not to bother calling him after that. I was angry at being rejected.\n\nWe are both in our early 40s and both (seemingly) elated at the passion that had returned to our lives in the beginning. But soon the daily morning phone call and a few quick texts from the car on his drive home were all we really had. Finally, I knew he had a weekend free with no family around - and I didn\u2019t hear a word. No phone calls, no offer to meet up despite having the rare opportunity. In my heart, I know he has found a new supply.\n\nHe got back in touch after the weekend but I felt done. I deleted Snapchat and he wrote to me elsewhere to ask why. I told him he could call me, he never hesitated before. He hasn\u2019t. All that love - where is it now?\n\nSo far, textbook narcissist, right? So why am I doubting myself?

A thing I did that he wanted me to stop. A thing I did on nights after an argument to remind myself that generally, we were happy, and I was ok, and all relationships have fights. Everyone feels like this sometimes. A thing I did that started becoming almost superstition. If I didn't do it, if I didn't need the reminder, we wouldn't fight. A thing I tried to do while I cried in the shower so he wouldn't hear me. And finally, a thing I stopped doing. I don't remember stopping. I don't remember when I started doing it less. I remember the thoughts. I remember the tears. I remember feeling so hopeless. \nTonight, when I drew a heart on the imprint of yesterday's heart, it all came flooding back. Something so simple. At first, my heart broke. This was supposed to be my forever relationship. This was supposed to be the man that loved me. And then for a few minutes, I got mad at myself, staring at that heart. How did I let this happen. The question I've tortured myself with for months. And then finally, as the heart faded from the heat of the water, I remembered the most important part of it. I realized it. I left. I'm happy enough again for this tiny little habit of mine come back. I'm free. I was terrified and scared and crying when I left, and now I'm right back to being the woman he was trying to make sure I would never be. And no one can ever take that away from me again. \nI might still have nightmares sometimes. I might still be working on myself, and will be for a long time.

Also he was dating multiple girls at once. \n\nFast forward and I notice several of my belongings are missing (new season, I thought they were in storage) and I think everyone else must be lying because he treated me like a princess mostly. He had a fragile ego yet wanted attention etc. He was horribly abused as a child - beaten, raped, starved, neglected, forced to do drugs, no consistent clean clothes or toilets... so I thought they\u2019re lying and I can text him to get my things. I remember he had a woman\u2019s belongings in his room in a box when I met him and he said it was his mother\u2019s things.\n\nWe meet, and I realize how the others were probably right. His actions all make sense - he\u2019s a monster. And his love was a lie.

He said \u201cwe don\u2019t need to get into evidence, I will just agree to a no-contact order with the same terms and conditions as a 2-year order of protection so long as it expires off my record before I take my law license exam\u201d. \n\nWhat do I do?

I hope someone reads it, at least!   \n\n\nToday, as I'm in the shower, I suddenly realized that I am a child of abuse.  \nUp until today, I thought I just had a chaotic household. I thought if they weren't beating me, then it was okay. It wasn't that bad. I thought that this was common in poverty-striken families. What I didn't consider was that both of my parents are narcissistic, manipulative people who should have never been allowed to breed in the first place. I would walk on eggshells in my own home, scared to even leave my room to go to the bathroom, because I was scared of what would happen.  \nWhen I was a young child (under 10 years old) my aunts would send me money for my birthday, without fail, every year. They knew we didn't have money for \"fun\", so they would always include cute little messages like \"treat yourself! Have fun at the movies!\". Every single year, without fail, my parents would \"borrow\" said money for bills. They bullied a young child into giving up her birthday money so that they could buy cigarettes &amp; alcohol. That right there is financial abuse.  \n\n\nWhenever my dad would drink, he would get mad, &amp; come into my room telling me how he didn't have money for bills, how we were going to be homeless, how I should pack my stuff by the morning because we wouldn't be staying here much longer. I remember always feeling so scared and anxious, worried that I was going to have to give up my home, my bed, everything in my room. He would scare me so badly that under 10 years old, I knew what it was like to have a panic attack.   \n\n\nMy mom NEVER spent any time with me growing up. I would always try, &amp; ask her if she wanted to go window shopping, or if I could walk with her to the grocery store, or if she wanted to read a book or watch a movie with me. Every time I was met with the same cold, hard \"no\".   \n\n\nWhen I started college, I had financial aid. My parents knew about this and my mom came to me one day, asking if my dad could borrow 1000$ from me, that he needed it to pay off some debt, he was desperate &amp; that's the only reason why they were coming to me. At first I said no, but then she said things like \"well he's going to kick you out if you don't, you know how he gets, why can't you just contribute to this household\". So I did it. I gave it to them. And surprise, surprise, I haven't seen the money since. I had to leave school because he wouldn't give me the documents I needed to turn in next semester's paperwork for financial aid. I couldn't afford it, &amp; in my last year, I left, taking 20K of student loan debt and no degree with me. He gave me the biggest panic attack I've ever had in my life; I thought I was dying. When I was clutching my chest, couldn't breathe, couldn't hold myself up because my body was numb &amp; tingling, he's yelling at me while my mom tries to calm me down, saying that this is stupid, I must be on drugs, yelling at me in my face that I'm high because of my reaction.

Thank you all for sharing your stories.\n\nI am 27 year old female. Few years ago I came to the conclusion I have been sexually abused in early childhood by my grandpa and quite likely by my father as well, but I keep questioning whether it really happened or if my mind is playing tricks on me and made me create false memories.\n\nAt the same time it seems very likely this really happened and it feels completely unbelievable. This will be a long read and I want to thank you in advance for having the patience to read it through.\n\nAs a child I think I was fairly \"normal\" and mostly a happy child. I was very sexual and masturbated a lot since I was 4 or 5, usually using stuffed toys. Sometimes I did it in kindergarten with other children. I remember having very sexual plays with other kids all the time, but most of them were quite innocent I believe? I also used to arrange my stuffed toys and dolls in sexual positions etc. It was almost like OCD behaviour.\n\n\u00a0Like I wrote, I wasn't particularly anxious before puberty, but I was quick-tempered and I sometimes got violent outbursts. For example, one time when I was 7yo my friend (few years older, kind and caring boy) tickled me and I completely lost it immediately and punched and kicked the boy and I continued doing so when he was already on ground. I felt I always needed to be in control. I also lied a lot about mundane things and I have no idea why I did that. I was very prone to daydreaming and had a vivid imagination, but I wasn't completely \"in my head\" - I was also an athletic and lively child.\n\nEven though most of the sexual plays with other kids were rather innocent, the most worrisome thing I remember is that as a 9 year old I was in my room with this boy who was my classmate. I wanted to \"play sex\" with him and I remember wanting to try genital-on-genital, even penetrative sex with him. We didn't go very far, because he didn't want to. Now that I think of the situation, I realize the boy was anxious and scared, I was pushing him and that definitely counted as COCSA.\u00a0\n\nWhen puberty hit (it hit early, I was 9 or 10) I became very anxious, depressed and dissociative. I developed an eating disorder, self-harmed and I wore only masculine baggy clothes to hide my body. I stopped eating, stopped going to school. During that time me and my mom moved to a strange city, because of my mother's work and I had to spend too much time alone and I didn't have any friends. My mother didn't drink alcohol at all, so she didn't notice when I drank vodka from the bottles she got as a present and re-filled the bottle with water. As 11 years old I was at school intoxicated and no one noticed that...\u00a0\n\nFrom the age 12 I was in and out of psychiatric wards because of my mental health issues. My teenage years were extremely chaotic and filled with alcohol, drugs, toxic relationships, hyper-sexuality and sexual abuse by numerous older men. I think psychiatrists and other professionals suspected I had been victim of CSA, but I didn't have any memories of sexual abuse in my childhood and my mom wasn't aware anything like that had happened.\n\nI try to keep this story short... So, I struggled with vast variety of troubles, attempted suicide several times and everything was a mess. I actually have no memories of who was the first person to penetrate me. There is like a blank spot in my memories, but I know I was sexually active since 12-13. At 18 I was diagnosed with BPD. At 20 I started my first safe and healthy relationship (with another woman). That was when my life changed drastically, I quit drinking, doing drugs and self-harming and for the first time realized I had had no idea what was healthy sex/sexuality until then and how much abuse I had endured during my teen years. At 21 I started identifying as transgender and rushed into medical transitioning. I changed my name, started using hormones and had a mastectomy. I kind of became someone else and distanced myself from being a woman. During that time I also had weed-infused psychotic episodes when I experienced whole body flashbacks of all kinds of sexual abuse, but I separated those moments from my conscious or thinking mind or \"ego\". I was severely and deeply dissociated, but also in denial of the dissociation.\n\nAt 24-25, one year after having my breasts surgically removed, I started having full body flashbacks of sexual abuse again. It was usually triggered by smoking weed or seeing a rape scene in a movie. I finally realized I am suffering from very severe dissociative disorder and that my gender dysphoria and transgender identity was caused by sexual abuse and dissociation that followed. I made the decision to \"detransition\". During this time, for the first time, I had a full body flashback of being raped as a small child by my grandpa (my body felt like I was maybe 2-4 years old). I felt like living through it again and that flashback was the most frightening thing that I have ever experienced. I had smoked weed when it occurred.\u00a0\n\nI had absolutely no memories of my grandpa ever doing anything sexual to me, but I remember there was some uncomfortable feeling around him even though I also remember liking him very much. I have this one picture of my cousin (by the time maybe 2 years old) sitting on grandpa's lap and my granpa looking at her kind of creepily. This picture has always made me feel uncomfortable and I don't know why I have that picture... I believe I have took it from a family album, but why? I don't know. I also remember my grandpa making some inappropriate jokes (not necessarily towards me) and having this \"dirty old man\" vibe. I remember him goofing around in his underwear and being somehow \"flirtatious\", but I dont know... maybe he was like that, goofy and playful with a bit pervy sense of humor? I remember sleeping next to him and he would draw on my back with his finger. Now I'm not sure whether there was something sexual in that situation or whether it was just innocent intimate moment between a grandparent and a child.\n\nThe dynamics of that side of family (he's my father's father) have been... well, I don't think \"weird\" is enough to describe it... highly dysfunctional and messed up maybe? Like, my father is completely fucked up as a person. I know he self-harmed since he was a teen, he had a drinking problem, perhaps a sex addiction as well and (according to my mom) a history of being sexually assaulted in his 20s. He has always been EXTREMELY UNSTABLE chaotic unhappy person and when I was a child he became a \"born-again\" fundamentalist Christian and a preacher. He has cut contact with his parents and siblings several times. My mom and dad broke up when I was 4 and I lived together with mom, so I didn't see my father's side of the family that much... Dad has three younger siblings, all of them adopted and much younger than dad. I feel like there has always been lot of drama, fighting and unresolved issues in their family. Grandpa has shitloads of narcissistic traits (and so does my father, but my father is more of a borderline where grandpa is more like this textbook narcissist who seems charming and funny and warm but is actually 100% self-absorbed). My father's mother has suffered from depression as long as I know. Father's youngest sibling had bed wetting issues throughout her childhood.\u00a0\n\nWhen I was maybe 10 or 11, me and dad visited my granpa's house... it was quite soon after my granparents had separated and grandpa was in a relationship with his new wife. I believe it was the last occasion dad and grandpa saw each other. They had a massive fight. I remember them yelling at each other. I remember my dad crying. I remember hearing the words \"sexually abusing a child\" but I can't remember what was the context. Maybe it was something that wasn't fully addressed - kind of like something that was thrown in the air and it was left there hanging silently to create even tenser atmosphere. My father was a total mess that night and when he wanted to leave I was scared to go into the car with him so I stayed with grandpa and his wife while my dad drove away. I believe my father also punched my grandpa at some point, but I didn't see that.\n\nI feel very conflicted about everything. I suspect my grandpa had (probably) raped my father and maybe his siblings (at least the youngest one) and he has (probably) raped me as well. I also suspect my grandpa hasn't been the only one who abused me - my dad has done it to me as well (more on that later). And I have read that it's not unusual that the victim of incest abuses his own children at some point...\n\nI don't have clear memories of any of the abuse. I am still unsure whether it really happened, but my body knows something has happened.\n\nI definitely have CPTSD and my mental health history is a huge evidence that something like this indeed happened.\n\nI have chronic pain in my lower back, around my anus, in my legs and I have lots of pain and issues around my genitalia as well. I've always had difficulties defecating (I hold shit inside and can't relax). I feel like my lower body is somehow \"locked\" in a state of trying to fight against rape. I do a lot of somatic trauma and tension releasing practices, but even though I sometimes have huge releases, there's still huge amounts of stuck energy in my body. So much tension. So much pain.\n\nI have these random pictures flashing in my head sometimes. They are not full memories and\u00a0I don't know if they are real or something i have created when I have tried to figure out what happened to me. If these are false memories, I fear I will make them stronger by writing them...\n\n1. I'm in my grandparents room on the bed and I smell my grandpa. The smell of him makes me feel unwell.  \n(I sometimes have olfactory flashbacks of that smell and I hate it)\n2. I'm in a shower in the same house. I believe I am alone with granpa. I associate this memory with his smell as well. Sometimes I have this image in my head, but I also associate it with fear, great pain in my asshole, blood and high anxiety. To me, this somehow seems way to gory to be real.\n3. I am a small baby. I'm on a nursing table and my father's dick and balls are very close to my face. (This image might have something to do with some news I read about man raping a baby when I was 12)\n4. I am in apartment where my dad lived when I was maybe 10-11 and I am on his and his wife's bed. My dad rapes me. The worst thing is that once I imagined this scene in my head, it felt good to me. Like horrifying but arousing and physically pleasing.\n\nLike I already wrote, my father is a fucked up person. He has serious mental health issues and is obviously very traumatized and wounded person. When I was little, I believe I adored him and I still do love him very much even though I have gone no contact with him several years ago because of his homophobic emotional abuse. Even though I love him, I have always felt uncomfortable about him touching me in any way. When I was a teenager I found out he had a profile on then popular social media site that was mainly used by teenagers. It gave me massive predator vibes and I wouldn't be surprised at all to found out he has raped children. He kind of \"looks like a pedophile\". I have always had weird sexual feelings towards him. Like I remember watching this one picture of him on the beach with speedos on and I was obsessed about his bulge. My younger step brother says he doesn't remember his childhood, but I remember him being inappropriately sexual towards both me and my father when he was maybe 5. My brother says he is traumatized my emotional abuse and religious brainwashing, but he hasn't said anything about sexual abuse. I sometimes have weirdly sexual thoughts about my brother as well. I wouldn't never ever act out these thoughts. I wonder whether it is typical for siblings who are victims of incest to have sexual feelings towards each other? We didn't grow up together and only saw each other occasionally so maybe that also affects that it's easier to develop sexual feelings towards a sibling?\n\nI want to add I became heavy user of internet porn very early on (9-11) and I've seen lots of traumatizing content online. I accidentally saw child porn as a pre-teen and I wonder if the exposure to hideous porn has affected the formation of all these intrusive mental images. Is it possible I wasn't abused in early childhood myself, but that I was traumatized by porn and created false memories? I know that during the teen years the abuse was very real, but I'm unsure about the incest memories.\n\nOk. Sorry about this post being so massive. If this was a child abuse investigation case unrelated to me, I would say this is quite obvious, but I find it difficult to trust my own mind. I have managed to make myself believe other things that weren't true, so maybe that's what is happening again.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

This took multiple forms-unwanted and persistent kissing, verbal harassment, stalking, inappropriate groping and touching, filming me getting changed and flashing. Any time I protested he would start hitting himself and threatening suicide. School didn't believe me until I came with a group of about 5 friends and a list spanning several years. Due to his personal problems I was demonised by much of the school when I tried to stand up against it so by the end my self esteem and self worth had been utterly crushed and I began to believe this was the treatment I deserved.\nI've only recently become aware of the effects this has had on my mental state, both presently and looking back. I've found myself manipulated into unwanted and unhealthy relationships, suffering low self esteem, self worth, and depressive episodes and suicidal thoughts. I find it very difficult to stand up for myself. Certain things will sometimes trigger me into depersonalisation episodes and I often feel strong senses of guilt, shame and embarassment. Whilst the abuse was ongoing I became increasingly withdrawn emotionally and would bottle everything up to come until every few months I would explode into a furious crying mess (I'm through that now). I struggle to be intimate, vulnerable or open unless I trust the other person completely. I find it especially hard to trust other guys. \nI only recognised my abuse for what it really was earlier this year. Recently I've been trying to go to see counsellors at my uni to try and get help but every time I do I panic and lose my nerve and leave overwhelmed on the verge of tears. The idea of opening up to a stranger terrifies me more than anything else.\nOn a positive note I have formed my first serious and long term relationship and I really want to get better.\nAny advice or similar experience would be incredibly appreciated.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He swept me off my feet. I'd never felt more confident, and beautiful and free. He called me beautiful, he bought me flowers. The sex was amazing, he was a giver. Afterwards he would play with my hair and hold me, trace my face with his fingers. He was so good at wearing his mask. \n\nI thought it was normal for the affection and the compliments to become less after the typical honey moon phase. But I didn't think it would stop altogether. And at some point it just did. I can't remember the last time he acknowledged anything about my appearance other than commenting on my breast size. We were together for 6 years.\n\nHe would triangulate me with his female coworkers. With his child's mother. I'd see the \"hey beautiful\" texts and the flirting. He would gaslight me and I'd drop the subject.\n\nI would cry myself to sleep at night wondering what was wrong with me. Was it because I'd gained weight? He had too but I still found him sexy. I would tell him all the time. We'd lay in bed and if I got him to let me be affectionate, I'd just lay on his chest and look at him the way I used to in the beginning. But he would be looking at his phone. He never looked at me the way he used to. We had some really bad days but I was still so in love. I'd tell him he had the most beautiful eyes, perfect lips. Loved his arms. He would just sit there and take in my words. Or he'd act like I was lying and shrug me off. I once asked him \"what's your favorite feature on me?\" He didn't respond or look at me. I asked again and he just said \"I'm not answering that stupid question \" not once even looking up from his phone. I rolled over and cried as quietly as I could. He told me I was being ridiculous and was pissed off with me for the rest of the night. \n\nIt's sad thinking about how starved I was for affection. I used to have to ask for him to kiss me more than just a peck, he'd be annoyed and shove me off if I tried to kiss him more intimately. But then when he was in a mood to be affectionate I'd quickly oblige because I felt wanted. Sex became the same way. Only if he was in the mood. He didn't go down on me once in the last 4 years of the relationship. Another hit to my self esteem. I would ask why, and he wouldn't respond. I asked if there was something wrong with me and he would just tell me no and to drop it. \n\nThe biggest blow was 4 months ago when I found out he was cheating. They hadn't had sex yet, the girl told me, but he'd done everything to her. He did things to her he hadn't given me in years. Some nights he would come home from work late and wake me up for crazy passionate sex. I thought it was because he wanted me, but in the moment I discovered his infidelity I realized that he got off on doing those things to her and then screwing me right after. I don't think he even brushed his teeth in between. It makes me sick to think about. \n\nSo here I am 4 months out from leaving him and I'm trying to rebuild myself. Some days are just so hard. I still feel dead inside. It doesn't help that he hasn't found a new supply, and that he keeps begging for me to give him another chance. Saying all the things I'd wanted him to say for years.\n\nIf you read all this thank you, I just needed to talk to people who know what this feels like.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have recently started therapy but my next appointment is a couple weeks away and I just want to get this out. \n\nI was never sexually abused to my knowledge, a couple close calls but nothing I remember. If I had a time machine or repressed memories it wouldn't shock me though. I grew up with a single mom and basically witnessed every type of abuse as a Child.\n\n I got married pretty young basically to my first relationship. After a couple years as I felt more comfortable I realised I wanted to have kids. We ended up getting divorced and it never happened. I've dated 2 women with kids since. \n\nGirl #1 had a boy at the time, first or second grade maybe I can't remember exactly how old. One of the times I was on a date with my ex we brought her son to a playground. This kid had a lot of energy and was a very open and outgoing kid. Not really being around kids since I was a kid, I was shocked at my reaction and how much I wanted a family. I was in my mid 20s at the time. Her son just grabbed my hand like it was normal and I felt like I was hit by lightning. My family doesn't hug and when I had my first girlfriend she would hug me and I would freeze. I am ok at faking it now but I would never just hug someone other than my girlfriend. \n\nWe had a great time at the park and he did that thing where the kid holds both our hands and swings between us, I will never forget it. When I was dating this girl I told her I wanted kids and that because I never had a dad and the only father figures I had growing up were bad ones I wanted to be a good dad. I wanted to learn about manly stuff like cars and fishing etc before I had a kid. We ended up breaking up for other reasons.\n\nGirl #2 - this is more recent....2 girls 6 and 4. I dated this girl for over 6 months. She would have the kids 1 week on 1 week off with their dad. I liked this because I could spend time with her solo and as a group with the kids. We ended up breaking up but 2 issues I want to talk to my therapist about are. \n\n1) seeing her struggle financially reminded me of how much my mom struggled as a single mom. I would help my ex financially as much as she would let me but when she would fight me on helping her out it just was painful watching her struggle.\n\n 2) some situation where I ask her kids what grade they're in or what's going on with school and say it's second grade or just starting school and it triggers my memories of the abuse and trauma I had seen when I was that little. I mean I remember stuff from before I even started school crystal clear like a movie...and I just look at this kid and realise how little and innocent and defenseless they are and that I was the same....I don't understand how could anyone hurt a kid? I think of the things I saw at that age and it just freaks me out. I don't want to pass on anything negative. There were anger issues in my house growing up, and I've always been aware of that and how it affected me. If I get mad at a video game I just shut it off and go play guitar or something. My brother is still effected by the anger issues and he yells and swears at the t.v. while playing video games.....I would never do anything intentionally but what if I get mad and swear and it scares a kid like I was scared? I can't do that to someone else.....when I was dating girl #2 we were walking at this campground with one of her girls and we didn't notice that she had dropped her favorite doll somewhere. The girl I was dating left me alone with her daughter while she went back to look for the doll and her daughter was so sad and scared for her doll. I tried to be positive and obviously I already was planning on buying her a new one but I just kept thinking, is this going to be a memory for her? Is she going to be scarred like I am? \n\nMy childhood affected me so much that I've never drank alcohol or done any drugs. I'm not perfect and have my own issues to work on but I would never hit a woman or a kid. All the women I've dated in the past know that. \n\nWith finally admitting that my childhood affected me more than I realised and asking for help and starting therapy I'm just scared. I think sometimes maybe it's just best that all these bad memories end with me.\n\nI would like to have a family because being around kids and doing family things makes me happy but I don't want to cause or pass on anything negative.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

All this happened, while I told him that I didn\u2019t think I was looking at him with rose-tinted glasses (after he claimed I was doing so); after I told him that I didn\u2019t have to spin Wanda\u2019s line on him (he loves Bojack Horseman), that \u2013\n\n*\"when you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags.\"*\n\nThe red flags did indeed just look like flags at that time.\n\nI thought of nothing when he disparaged my ideal career path; when he kept trying to get me to pursue a law degree I honestly could not afford after I was done with my current studies (because I\u2019d be better off as a lawyer, he said); or when he told me I was \u201cnot hot\u201d and that I\u2019d be more his type if I were shorter;\n\nI didn\u2019t think it was strange when I knew all his past romantic encounters imploded after not too long; or when he told me he doesn\u2019t even know what love means; or the fact he had three phone numbers that were simultaneously in use (that of course, were used to keep the various facets of his multi-faceted life separate);\n\nI didn\u2019t think it was that odd when he told me to leave him messages but rarely replied to them; or that he texted other people while not talking to me at all over a video call \u201cbecause [he] had nothing to say\u201d; or that he told me that chasing people is half of the fun;\n\nI thought it was just normal that he sent well-timed messages when I was prying apart after arguments on things that I believed violated my boundaries \u2013 boundaries he set for himself at the start \u2013 because I trusted he cared about me;\n\nI thought it was okay that every time we did something sexual, it was always me providing him with pleasure and rarely the other way round unless it was an indication I should start working on him; or that his stone-cold no-effort kisses were fine by me because *I loved him*;\n\nAnd I thought it was just his way of doing things, that he would be so willing to tell me about everything about his work day, and yet have absolutely zero interest in me telling him a single line of how\u2019d my day been - that you could see his face change in a split second whenever we went to talking to him to talking about me. And he had the cheek to ask me why I'd never talk about what's going on in my life anymore.\n\nI made an excuse for every single one of his bad behaviour. \u201cHe\u2019s just texting his colleagues\u201d \u2013 although I knew his colleagues weren\u2019t on that messaging app. \u201cHe\u2019s just really, really busy given the nature of his job.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s just tired and can\u2019t listen to you talk about a bit of your day.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just natural he\u2019s not asking you out because he doesn\u2019t have time.\u201d\n\nI apologised for every single thing \u2013 especially after me telling him about things that wouldn\u2019t make me feel comfortable. \u201cI\u2019m not responsible and don\u2019t want to be responsible for your emotions\u201d, he said. It sounded right. I was the troublemaker. I ought to be sorry.\n\nBut instinctively, somewhere in my gut or my brain knew I wasn\u2019t to be sorry for all of this. My previous reactions whenever I heard about an omitted fact/piece of information that changed the entire situation were indeed justified. The day I went back to university abroad, he told me something that I could no longer rationally make or conjure an excuse for, given the boundaries **he** set for us. For once, I chose to break and not accept it. I stood on my grounds and didn't apologise. Yet, it was almost as if he prepared for me to accept it all that while. He texted me on his own accord the few days before in a row (he almost never initiated chats with me after the lovebombing phase unless it was about a dinner I was paying, or something that would lead to sex), as if preparing me for the big bombshell, and hoping that I\u2019d still accept whatever new inferior arrangement he had in mind. After he realised I wasn\u2019t accepting whatever he was proposing, he went on the offensive and discarded me. He discarded me while I was still trying to be nice and telling him I\u2019d still like to be his friend, and that I still do care about him regardless, even despite all that hurt and bouts of crying he caused to me. He made it known in no uncertain terms that my replacement has been readied, and that I was just one out of many he was dealing with. I pleaded him to tell me how many was \"many\", to no avail. I was also the primary one to be abused - it was convenient for him before the discard. I live ten minutes away from him back home - much closer than the other people he was dealing with, and I'd be physically ready to offer whatever he needed whenever he needed it.\n\nIt\u2019s been exactly a month since that day. I\u2019ve been seeing a therapist that has helped towards rewiring my brain and reminding it's none of my fault, that I deserved to be loved and that no one deserves to be abused. I've been trying to reinforce the fact that it wasn\u2019t my fault even though my judgement faltered; or that I couldn\u2019t help him be a better version of himself. It wasn\u2019t because of me that made him act like this. I'm still scarred about myself that I often do wonder if I am truly the horrendous person he painted out me to be, only to be reminded again and again by the people around me that I'm really a much nicer person than that. It's just so hard to believe it sometimes.\n\nMeanwhile, I've happened to find out the identity of one of his exes. She moved away to another country, seemingly out of the blue, that coincided with the time-period after her being with him. I do wonder if, but also do strongly suspect that, he was the cause of it all.\n\nI\u2019m just glad my second ordeal was *only* for three months. But for all of you out there who are healing as well, just be careful. You\u2019re vulnerable to another narc, and that this entire thing is so insidious \u2013 that you won\u2019t know what hit you until it\u2019s over. This was indeed my own experience. Yet, do know that you\u2019re awesome and great, and never stop believing in that. The abuse doesn\u2019t define you, and what doesn\u2019t kill you will make you stronger. Remain as loving as you are, and engage in good faith as you have always done.\n\nDon\u2019t ever let any narc take those things away from you.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Because I was a child, I hung around him a lot and looked up to him, and was deeply grateful for his friendship and the gifts / material things he gave me, but I was constantly bullied, mocked and belittled. I was never treated with respect, and most of the time was instead subjected to extremely emotionally distressing things: waking me up by barging in my room and banging pots and pans together while yelling on multiple occasions, mocking me and humiliating me if i made a mistake in public, poking and prodding at my body in very odd ways that made me deeply uncomfortable and self-conscious, pressuring me into the use of substances at a very young age (alcohol and tobacco primarily) but always playing it off as some sort of brotherly love. He would always insist we were best friends, but truth be told I never really opened up or spoke to him on a fundamental level. I never felt secure around him or safe enough to open up, and instead felt anxious and unsafe in my home. Sometimes, even now, I flinch when he moves too close to me, though I am the bigger man now.

He is a big dude, has a short temper, and I believe he has major anger issues. Although, he was a great, hands-on dad when I was a child and provided a great life for me and my family. Still, due to his dominant and aggressive nature, I always wanted to be around my mom and didn't spend much alone time with him. When I was 14 and half through my freshman year of high school, my mom died. My dad became very depressed and expressed it through anger. I became terrified of him when he was in one of his \"moods.\" He would lose it over the smallest things, such as one dirty plate in the sink or leaving the tv on when I wasn't watching it. He would scream, throw plates and other objects, and cuss me out saying things like I was \"I was so f-ing lazy and inconsiderate, how my mom was no longer here to take care of me and I needed to take care and clean up my f-ing shit, how no one is going to look after me anymore and I need to act like an adult, etc.\" He also wasn't very sympathetic to the fact that I lost my mother and didn't have patience for my grief and sadness since he was going through a lot as well. The worst was when he would throw and slam our cat down on the floor or throw her into cabinets. I felt and still feel so guilty that I couldn't help and protect her and just watched it happen, too afraid to say anything let alone move. Eventually, I would just hide in my room when he got home and only leave to eat dinner when he was asleep. Halfway through my junior year and all of my senior year, my dad found work in a city 3 hours away from my hometown and would stay in that town Monday- Friday and would come home on the weekends. I was actually relieved he was gone. However, a lot of my family members and friends didn't think this was right since my dad kind of abandoned me. I did live with my sister who was over 18 at the time, but it was still 100% on me to go to school, graduate, not get into legal trouble since I basically had minimal supervision. \n\nAlthough my dad was in such a bad place, I feel like he was this way because he was super depressed himself and didn't know how to handle losing his wife? My grandpa was also very physically abusive to my dad growing up. I am now 27 and have a pretty good relationship with him but we have never actually talked about this dark part in our lives. I feel like his actions have an impact on my self esteem and confidence, has lead me to automatically assume and prepare for the worst case scenario, and have caused me irrational anxiety and panic whenever I make a minor mistake or accident for fear of being yelled and cussed out. I haven't told a lot of people in my life how I feel and my story (even my husband) because I am afraid of them viewing him in a bad way. Is this normal? I finally went to a therapist a couple of months ago for the first time in my life after having a really bad meltdown about losing my mom and my relationship with my dad and didn't bring it up to the therapist either for fear of her judging him.

I let him know that I don't believe he ever loved me (or if he did, I didn't know how), and no matter what he said, I wouldn't believe him.

I honestly think I made them feel dumb, which was never my intention, and because of that, they used race as a way to limit the potential of my work and the potential to help others. They wanted me to exclude my caucasian participants in the preliminary trials, even asking me to ignore the sample case they gave me as a model and which resulted in my participant pool being cut in half.\n\nBeyond this I saw a pervasive greed within the field of psychology that I could no longer stomach. A drive for profit over practicality at the cost of patient lives. The peoples' from which I gathered my work gave their knowledge freely in the hope of helping.\n\nSince then, I've switched to another field and another school in another state and another time zone  but my research and experiences need to be made public for the sake of patients everywhere. Not just because of exposing corruption, but because I found a method of treating PTSD that gives the results of 10 years of therapy in 2 and doesn't require a single prescription.\n\nThe *first* main difference between this therapy method and conventional methods is the assessment that PTSD is not a disorder, rather it acts as a natural process intended to ensure the survival of the group. It focuses on analyzing, understanding and applying the \"lessons\"  of the symptoms instead of regulating the severity  and frequency of symptoms. Symptoms serve a function in  medicine, they allow the doctor to better assess the issues with the patient. In PTSD, it better allows the therapist to understand the psychological issues within a community.\n\nIn understanding the symptoms and their causes, the therapist is able to be more effective in their role. \n\nThe *second*, is that it focuses on group therapy and paired patients with compensating symptoms. An example of what I mean would be pairing someone who is bipolar with someone who has severe depression. During their high period, the bipolar person will work to elevate the depressed patient and during the low periods of the bipolar patient, the depression patient will compensate for the low due to the bond established between the two. It should be noted that as humans are a social species, it is common in social species for pairing in order to survive hardship. It should also be noted that morbid codependency would only be a concern if the patients did not progress through the therapy past having a companion added to their life. This pairing system works much like the sponsor system in A.A. in that it is a 24 hour line to both the support person, then group and, lastly the therapist as this method intends to reestablish the bonding sequence of social species that has been interrupted by the PTSD. \n\nThe *third* major difference is where the pharmaceutical industry would take a hit. Pre Colonial people's utilized a method of medicating the patient using inhaled medicines that functioned not as a mood stabilizer, but an anti-anxiety medication that induced an emotionally neutral state. Essentially, they would use as necessary to reduce the anxiety of the patient to a level that would allow them to then run through the process of analyzing the symptom(s) and its relevant function. \n\nThis medicine in the midwest was commonly a kinnikinnick blend, smoked regularly. The Salix laevigata phylum acts as both an anti nausea as well as an anti anxiety medication. In any area of the world with marijuana it would be the same as this kinnikinnick blend in this affect. Arctostaphylos uva-ursi leaves were used to allow the person to actually control the flashback as it induces a slight hallucinatory state that is controllable with education as well as easily regulated inhalation of the medication.\n\nYou can legally grow Salix laevigata and Arctostaphylos uva-ursi anywhere without severe invasive species laws. Both are smoked, though as in the case of marijuana, it may one day be vaporizer capable. It is necessary to state that trade routes existed from Canada to Louisiana and from Louisiana to most of South America. Marijuana, cocaine, dmt, peyote, mushrooms as well as teachings applicable to them were considered trade medicines as the Ruderalis strain grows in the north wild to this day and the Cartel grows it in the south, to this day.  The rest is found wild. It is also necessary to mention that with the Indian religious freedom act of the United States allowing peyote, and the Jay treaty allowing free travel across borders for indigenous people to visit relatives, the wars on drugs that are in any way associated with traditional medicine of either continent is technically illegal and a human rights violation of indigenous peoples of these regions. \n\n*I have mentioned that the symptoms of PTSD serve a purpose and, while I will explain that, I must first give some introductory information to a few core concepts of my research.* \n\nTo anyone who has ever hurt or injured an animal that was able to survive: what did they do? They run, they hide, they change their behavior, they test changing their patterns to try to get back to a normal life and adapt to survive. A prime example given the time of year is deer. A male who has been shot at will become nocturnal and move to the swamps in order to evade being hunted. They also will slowly start coming out earlier and earlier until they are confident that they will not be in danger. Deer are also being noted looking both ways before crossing roads in rural areas of Michigan and Wisconsin, a clear sign of learning to adapt over generations of exposure to motor vehicles.  \n\n**The first symptom: Run**\n\nSimply put, the feelings of anxiety, fight or flight, increased aggression when forced to stay still. The first noticeable signs of PTSD.\n\n**The second symptom: Hide**\n\nAgoraphobia, paranoia, high anxiety, mood swings, racing thoughts, fear.  The common symptoms of having PTSD. \n\n**The third symptom: Change their behavior**\n\nTesting new behaviours until they find one that allows them to feel safe. Attempts at healing from the events causing the PTSD. \n\n**The fourth symptom: Adapt**\n\nKeeping behaviours that work and getting rid of one's that are not productive to survival. Healing and moving forward from the events that caused the PTSD. \n\n***Step*** **five: The social species imperative**\n\nTeach others so that the group survives longer and with less hardship than previous generations.  Essentially passing on the information gathered in order to protect others. This step is hampered by psychology as talking about it is seen as pushing the patient. The patient was already pushed and aggression comes from confusion and frustration but, honesty comes from being too mad to think about the answer before it is given. Being there to put the patient back together is our job, not to label them fragile and pacify their desires to heal with half measures. \n\nThese symptoms are the subconscious attempting to train the individual in order to make sure that the person survives any future events of the same type. We know that there is increased activity in the hippocampus,  amygdala,  medial prefrontal cortex and subcortex. What do these things put together logically imply? The brain is forcing itself into an accelerated learning process.  Furthermore, the part of the brain causing night terrors and intrusive thoughts controls everything major in our bodies implying it can function as a secondary \"brain\" as noted in children born with anencephaly. PTSD is possible due to the rest of the brain being there, it just starts at the part necessary for life to even be remotely possible. Essentially one brain driven to survive and the other to have individual identity. When events trigger PTSD,  the second brain comes out of its \u201cfugue state\u201d and the nature of who our species is comes to light. In the days this medicine was not shunned and instead alive and free, this would be called a coming of age ceremony. \n\nThis base part of the brain doesn't necessarily have a verbal language but it does have one of symbolism and conceptual \"conversation\". Patterns of dreams, patterns within dreams, patterns of somatic symptoms in relation to certain triggers: these are all signs of this part of the brain attempting to communicate and train the individual to avoid possible future harm. An example is a series of night terrors that are of the same event, starting at different points within the event; there is obviously something about this event that the person has blocked out but the sub cortex has access to and is attempting to warn the person about. Language is complex as any linguist will tell you, and there are many ways to communicate besides the verbal sphere as any blind and deaf person can tell you. Essentially making the symbolism and concepts a hieroglyphic tailored to the patient and their life that the therapist must translate. \n\nThat is to say, dreams about crabs will only matter if the person had some affiliation with crabs or one crab in some way, even in a logo or nearby market. Mysticism is simply the easiest way to explain complex concepts to people who have no real background to understand or trust you. The fact it saved them makes it a spiritual practice for future generations and when those generations organize, a religious custom is born. Monsters do exist though mind you. But just like the trope, the real monsters were just people. \n\n***Sociopaths:*** The main Cause of PTSD outside of resource based conflict and natural disasters. They leave their victims feeling lethargic, or sometimes even dependent on them. The victim will present as sickly and withdrawn or,  aggressive and possibly even violent. These sound an awful lot like the symptoms of a Vampire, Witch, Succubus, Wendigo, Skinwalker, Nalusa Falaya, Oni, Djinn, Asanbosam and other forms of man eating giant or humanoid.. Sadly I do not have enough information on the stories of every country, making some difficult to include. However, I would appreciate it greatly if anyone wants to help contribute to the collection. The stories of these monsters are stories of sociopaths, not of the paranormal. But in the eyes of the victims family it would surely seem like a spell. \n\nMagic is just science we have yet to understand and if you can not explain a concept simply, you do not understand it well enough. This is what you get when you put religion, emotion, ego and race aside: healing. This is what happens when you put people, science and the SELF taken vow to help our patients first; instead of getting published, tenure, nobel prizes and a few more zeros in the bank account. Now when I was working on this I didn't stop when I hit roadblocks. I found willing participants and worked with people federally allowed to administer this therapy so no laws were violated. In the end I could only afford to treat two participants while working and going to school, especially in this economy. They were kind enough to include personal statements as to the effectiveness of these therapy methods.\n\n\"Given how the scientist who started this wants to keep his identity,  I am No One. I have professionally diagnosed PTSD and high functioning autism,  the PTSD partly just because i had autism in the first place. My PTSD comes from sexual abuse, physical abuse, mental abuse and ritualistic abuse. Some people have told me that it's easier to list what didn't happen and people tend to get depressed instead of seeing me as a person so that's all I am going to get into it.\n\nWhen the scientist found me I was homeless and had no one; he helped me find work, get on my feet and was there anytime I needed. There were plenty of 3 AM calls and visits in the beginning, I slept maybe 4 hours a night at most and would work as much as I could just to keep distracted. I would eat because he reminded me I needed to, I would get rides wherever I needed to help me get back to a normal life. \n\nI began using this method when I was offered nothing but pills at both the hospital and by therapists. Pills were a trigger for me and so it was just as much of an issue to take them as the issue I needed them for. I began using the lack of sleep to control my dreams(straight to rem sleep)  in order to try to understand what the night terrors meant. I had a harder time denying what happened when I was reliving it every night.  This method taught me that the dreams are like a training ground to stay sharp and keep alive. I wake up well rested now, even getting 8 hours (when my autism doesn't have something it wants to do). I wake up remembering the dreams but not fearing them or wrecked by them, just needing a moment to catch myself before I start my day, usually just an hour before I start the day. \n\nThe intrusive thoughts were there, and I still get flashbacks technically but, it's a half a second reminder or context instead of five or ten minutes and then a couple hours putting myself back together. I look forward to them as a sign to pay attention,  like a (piss off Disney,  Stan Lee is the man) spidey sense when danger is near. There is a lot we see and hear around us that we don't think is relevant but can trigger us at any moment, this therapy now has me knowing exactly what the smell trigger is warning me of, it makes the half a second flashback something no one notices but it tells me the context of a situation my subconscious is uncomfortable with.\n\nI get somatic pains still, but it's a warning I'm not taking care of myself and being stubborn.  The somatic pain and agoraphobia made me not want to move, a sign I wasn't ready to meet the world yet. After I started to work on understanding what happened to me, I feel my proper age again; I didn't realize how much I was ignoring. \n\nI have maintained seeing my therapist the whole time and now, four years later they ask me at least once a month if I still feel like our sessions are doing anything. Not that I am obstinate but that I went from not wanting to leave my bathroom to having such a normal life that I feel comfortable talking about my experience and want to share them to help others. \n\nPolitics and greed may have railroaded this but weaponized autism is real and I will pay it forward to the man who gave me my life back. They may take away his work, accuse him of lies, even try to discredit his work but it lives on in the two of us he helped and it lives on in everyone we have shared it with and helped and so on. This isn't some fringe therapy, this is real science from a real scientist who cares more about the promise to his patients than his name being known. My therapists were barely there at best and barely able to cope with what I lived through at worst. He never gave up, he never backed down, he was a real therapist and his system gave me my best friend. If not for those two, I wouldn't be alive today and I can say that with 100% certainty, I used to try hard not to be.\"\n\n\"I am a combat vet who served in the US Navy from 2013-2017.  I was told that I likely have childhood onset PTSD, that was made worse from me being in the Navy, by a licenced counselor in 2018. People lose VA benefits over this as a pre military issue so i had to pay out of pocket in order to keep what I do have. At  that time I luckily had reconnected with a childhood friend who was working on his masters in Psychology, specifically doing research on treatment of PTSD using pre colonial indigenous methods. I agreed to be a participant for his research, and I'm thankful I did. Now a days I live a normal life only occasionally touched by PTSD, and even then I have learned how to work through those moments so that it doesn't control my day. Pill free.\n\nWhile I was in the Navy, I had gone to 4 different counselors to try and figure out why I was have recurring issues with depression, anxiety, nightmares, suicidal and intrusive  thoughts and addiction. One of them kept trying to only distract me from the issues, two of them just wanted to teach me how to give myself an ego boost all of the time, and the last one thought I had a mild form of BPD. All of them asked if I wanted to be prescribed medication to \"help balance me out\", but I turned them down because I wanted to know why it was happening, not cover it up. Then I started to get help from my friend, and finally I started to feel like myself again. I had to be honest to those I was talking to and with myself about what I went through; I cried, yelled, threw things, and even laughed a bit. It took some time, but my flashbacks didn't happen as often, I didn't have as many nightmares, my mood started to balance out, and I was able to stop drinking or even have any desire to drink. Now, i know why they happen and use them to deal with life, instead of letting them run my life.\"\n\nMy research is currently being edited by a close friend and will be available as soon as it is complete, free of charge.

Comments appreciated.", "author": "Back2Reality222", "self_text": "Today is a year to the day since I left my (undiagnosed) NPD wife of 18 years. It's also two-months full No Contact (this has been difficult as we have a daughter together).\n\nThe night before she sent me this 'heartfelt' email I had discovered via Find My Phone that she was not in abroad for work as she had told me but still in this country. I now know that she had been doing this for years, adding extra days on to her work travel so that she could sleep with other men.\n\nThis was the email she sent me next day when she really actually did land abroad. She's obviously trying to placate my shock and hurt while totally denying that she had ever had any affairs. She almost succeeded, too. When I read it I found my anger dissipating and actually felt a little sad and sorry for my wife. She refers to the recent problems her mother had with her adulterous father, who we discovered had a second family (I now believe he is also NPD); our daughter, who for the last few years had been suffering from mysterious mental issues: an eating disorder, self-harming and two suicide attempts (I'm no pretty sure she it was actually Narcissistic Abuse Syndrome). And she talks about how why she suddenly started partying with a set of people 20 years younger than her.\n\nAll well and good. Except that two weeks later I finally took a look at her computer and found emails to other men, naked pictures of herself that she had been sending, and disgusting sexting messages that really are unrepeatable. I also discovered that she had been having a two-year affair with a guy 25 years younger than me. She's now with him full-time. \n\nAs always, I'll never be sure that she really has NPD. And as always I'd really appreciate any of your comments and observations. \n\nHere it is:\n\n\"Of course things are not right between us otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be putting you through this intense trauma.\n\nYou must understand that I am deeply distressed by it too. My chest feels like it\u2019s brick weighing down on me. Waves of anxiety come across me hourly. I\u2019m asking myself what the \\*\\*\\*\\* is going to happen. I\u2019m really scared.\n\nI have slowly built to this over probably years. It started when I my parents hit their problems. I found it traumatic. I tried to help but I actually had little impact. What I was left with was an incredible sadness for my mother who has not had a normal loving relationship her whole life. She is lonely and unfulfilled. And it\u2019s too late for her. I think I reacted by making sure that wasn\u2019t me. Regretting not living my life to the full. \n\nI thought i was quite a straight up person. Dealing with relationships and conflict head on. Brave. But what I did was start to disappear into a word of escapism. Mixed with the strong desire to be desired by others. Being in my early 40s I was seriously worried about losing my desirability. I got really fit. Opened my heart and mind to those who represented all the best of youth. Intelligent, hedonistic, successful young people. To my surprise they were attracted to me too. Even looked up to me as what they\u2019d like to be when they were my age. Still young minded with energy doing all the fun things. Looking good and fit but having a stable loving family. I had it all. So I thought.\n\nBecause it was so gradual as a good and loving husband and friend that you are, you gingerly accepted who the new me was becoming. It was fun for you too and I think you too were impressed by my metamorphosis but I know deep down you were scared where it would all end up.\n\nIt was also a good escape from our daughter and her inexplicable mental illness which we\u2019ve both struggled to come to terms with. Even now we don\u2019t really accept that she\u2019s ill. We are both in denial. Even now. I think that\u2019s the problem. She doesn\u2019t feel understood. \n\nOver the years I have enjoyed the attention from men making me feel young and attractive. The more I got the more powerful I felt. I was glad that we still had sex because I knew as soon as that ended it would be very damaging and hard to keep us together. My dream was that you\u2019d allow an open relationship where I could have you and see other men but you made clear that wasn\u2019t acceptable. I was deluded of course. I thought you\u2019d love me enough to let me do what I needed to do and then once it was out of my system we\u2019d grow old together. As sad as that sounds. \n\nYou\u2019ve been a fantastic husband who has shown me love in so many ways. You\u2019ve tolerated, even supported my freedom. You\u2019ve even given me the adulation that I so desperately crave from others. You\u2019ve been the rock while I\u2019ve been the kite. I know you didn\u2019t want to be the rock. But you were. For me. You played second to me. It was either that or lose me and our family. What choice did you really have.\n\nMy friends have never shared what they think of you other than positive things. Of course they wonder what\u2019s really going on and how you put up with me I\u2019m sure. Who can blame them. Who wouldn\u2019t. We all talk about each other. We are all flawed. Even dysfunctional. Most people are I\u2019ve come to realise. But we all accept each other and come together with love whenever we can. Look at the football. They all want to meet up. They don\u2019t have to. And you\u2019re part of that. It\u2019s brought me a lot of pleasure and happiness. Im sure they judge me more than they judge you. But I don\u2019t care as they are still my friends. However strange a set up it is.\n\nI have nothing but love for you. Whatever happens I want to see you happy. Preferably with me but if not then without. I know it\u2019s mostly my fault. I\u2019m selfish and shallow and not dealing well with getting older. I\u2019m not the first to go through this. Or the last. At least my crisis has been fun and joyous and exciting for me and others. Harder for you I know. \n\nI blame you for not fighting me harder for what you wanted. For being scared to tell me what you really feel and think. For not keeping the dialogue open. Which I too am guilty of by the way. For ignoring my cries for help. And me for ignoring your increasing sadness. But I know that you didn\u2019t want to rock the boat for fear of losing me. So I don\u2019t really blame you.\n\nBut now I can no longer appear to juggle family and partying and work and traveling and sofia. Because the small but hugely significant cog of sexual attraction and love making appears to have gone. I don\u2019t know if it it will come back for me. It would certainly make both our lives easier and happier if it did. Although we\u2019ve still got issues it would cover the cracks as it has done. And as you say bring closeness.\n\nI don\u2019t think divorce or throwing it all away in 5 mins is the answer. I think we have some issues to discuss and try to resolve first. I actually don\u2019t think focussing on sex is the answer. But instead our daughter, our friendship and talking and properly sharing how we truly feel. What we want from life. Our desires. We have one life and it\u2019s slipping away. I\u2019d like to travel and discover things. Not just work and party. I want to meet people and form new friendships. That makes me happy. I want to know what makes you happy. I actually don\u2019t know for sure anymore what that is. Maybe they are really different things and we\u2019ve grown apart it tou don\u2019t want to compromise on the things that you want to do anymore. \n\nI want us to truly understand our daughter and what she\u2019s going through. Like a project. Like when you met me and sussed out my hormones; logically as you\u2019re so good at. You\u2019re more emotional now which clouds your judgement. But together we can crack this. Apart will cause damage. \n\nI want you to fix your body. Get your hip done. Have thyroid checks. Take care of yourself. Feel good and confident. Your health will take you over if you\u2019re not careful. And our health is essential for a happy life.\n\nMy fear is that we split and like \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* (her former boyfriend, whom she dumped for me), you do all these things once you\u2019re out from under my shadow.\n\nYou\u2019re my best friend.

Feel amazing about that and have no regrets. He's apparently engaged to the woman he left me for now... good for them. I honestly don't give a shit because I'm grateful and happy I'm not with that abusive lunatic anymore. Like, truly.\n\nBut anyway, dating Post-Narc has been an adventure; each guy is better than the one before, but it's been an exercise in learning to value myself, bit by bit. I'm feeling confident than ever before these days.\n\nWhy? Exactly a week ago I broke up with a guy who, while not a full-fledged narc, was narc-y... He came on strong in the beginning, but immedietly presented an ultimatum guised as \"boundaries\" and which he phrased as \"future-proofing\" because he wanted to \"be serious\" with me.\n\nAll of that is a sign right there, and this was within 4 days of actual dating (we had known each other for a few months, during which time he had a big crush on me).\n\nHe also blurted out that he loved me in the first week of dating -- itself eyebrow raising -- and then took it back when I asked him about it a few days later: \"Oh, was I half-asleep? I was just talking nonsense.\" He was sitting up and was cognizant enough to order me an Uber back to my place... it was just odd that we couldn't even talk about it.\n\nHe moved really fast in the beginning, and when I asked us to slow down he suddenly no longer wanted to be my \"boyfriend\" because there were \"emotional repercussions\" for MY \"back-and-forth.\" Thus began the dance where he began withholding affection and asking for \"space\" when I felt confused by how the man sending \"how are you, how's your heart\" texts in the beginning suddenly decided he didn't want to call or even text pretty much at all. Suddenly he was \"squeezing me in\" to his schedule and getting frustrated that I couldn't see that, even though \"SQUEEZE IN\" were his choice of words.\n\nLike... hello insensitive? \n\nAnyway, it's bittersweet. He was encouraging and supportive and warm in a lot of ways, and our sex life was off the chain, but he was controlling and extremely rigid in other ways; I just didnt feel he made space for me in any significant way. He's in AA and 2 years sober, which I really respect and also suspect is why he's also controlling and rigid, because that's how he is with himself. I know it's not personal and that's been really empowering. \n\nBut that doesn't mean he can \"change\" or will \"realize\" that he wants to be with me. He was ice cold when we broke up over the phone last weekend (communication issues, which were the big thing we were experiencing, came to a head during the 3-week vacation he took visiting his family, and I couldn't accept literally no communication and him getting annoyed at me contacting him at all). He called me \"emotionally expensive\" and said I \"didn't listen and didn't care about crossing his boundaries,\" which were that I only text X number of times a day with no expectation of a response.\n\n...that's not a \"boundary,\" that's just controlling! I asked him, \"how am I supposed to know your \"rules\" if they're always changing?\" Who even wants to deal with \"rules,\" anyway? I also told him I'm worth the \"expense\" and was left aghast by that comment. It's a putdown meant to make ME feel bad when HE was stonewalling me. \n\nI don't need that shit.\n\nPlus, the little I know about his romantic history is that he broke up with a woman at his job last year that ended so badly he changed jobs. Why? His mom got sick and he needed to focus on that and she \"demanded too much.\" He told me this in the beginning and while I gave him the benefit od the doubt given the circumstances with his mother, I DID take mental note of it. The same thing happened with me... I \"asked too much,\" i.e. to be a part of his life.\n\nAlso, the fact that he blamed her at all for anything... even when I look back at my penultimate Nex, it wasn't that HE was so terrible but rather that I had such low self-worth (and I forgive myself!) that I participated. THAT was the real issue.\n\nSo, what's cool is that I'm not afraid of being alone this time. I still have a little voice in me that imagines reunion scenarios (esp since he has a watch of my friend that I borrowed and left at his place that she wants back), but I'm integrating her by reminding her that I deserve MORE, that I didn't \"mess it up,\" that my wants and feelings are valid, and that I'd rather have peace of mind than a relationship; I am genuinely not interested in \"saving the relationship at any cost\" and am truly letting it go by *gasp* a) actually enjoying my own company and b) feeling confident that something more fit for me is coming along.\n\nTLDR: Thank u, next", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Comments appreciated.", "author": "Back2Reality222", "self_text": "Today is a year to the day since I left my (undiagnosed) NPD wife of 18 years. It's also two-months full No Contact (this has been difficult as we have a daughter together).\n\nThe night before she sent me this 'heartfelt' email I had discovered via Find My Phone that she was not abroad for work as she had told me but still in this country. I now know that she had been doing this for years, adding extra days on to her work travel so that she could sleep with other men.\n\nThis was the email she sent me next day when she really actually did land abroad. She's obviously trying to placate my shock and hurt while totally denying that she had ever had any affairs. She almost succeeded, too. When I read it I found my anger dissipating and actually felt a little sad and sorry for my wife. She refers to the recent problems her mother had with her adulterous father, who we discovered had a second family (I now believe he is also NPD); our daughter, who for the last few years had been suffering from mysterious mental issues: an eating disorder, self-harming and two suicide attempts (I'm no pretty sure she it was actually Narcissistic Abuse Syndrome). And she talks about how why she suddenly started partying with a set of people 20 years younger than her.\n\nAll well and good. Except that two weeks later I finally took a look at her computer and found emails to other men, naked pictures of herself that she had been sending, and disgusting sexting messages that really are unrepeatable. I also discovered that she had been having a two-year affair with a guy 25 years younger than me. She's now with him full-time.\n\nAs always, I'll never be sure that she really has NPD. And as always I'd really appreciate any of your comments and observations.\n\nHere it is:\n\n\"Of course things are not right between us otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be putting you through this intense trauma.\n\nYou must understand that I am deeply distressed by it too. My chest feels like it\u2019s brick weighing down on me. Waves of anxiety come across me hourly. I\u2019m asking myself what the \\*\\*\\*\\* is going to happen. I\u2019m really scared.\n\nI have slowly built to this over probably years. It started when I my parents hit their problems. I found it traumatic. I tried to help but I actually had little impact. What I was left with was an incredible sadness for my mother who has not had a normal loving relationship her whole life. She is lonely and unfulfilled. And it\u2019s too late for her. I think I reacted by making sure that wasn\u2019t me. Regretting not living my life to the full.\n\nI thought i was quite a straight up person. Dealing with relationships and conflict head on. Brave. But what I did was start to disappear into a word of escapism. Mixed with the strong desire to be desired by others. Being in my early 40s I was seriously worried about losing my desirability. I got really fit. Opened my heart and mind to those who represented all the best of youth. Intelligent, hedonistic, successful young people. To my surprise they were attracted to me too. Even looked up to me as what they\u2019d like to be when they were my age. Still young minded with energy doing all the fun things. Looking good and fit but having a stable loving family. I had it all. So I thought.\n\nBecause it was so gradual as a good and loving husband and friend that you are, you gingerly accepted who the new me was becoming. It was fun for you too and I think you too were impressed by my metamorphosis but I know deep down you were scared where it would all end up.\n\nIt was also a good escape from our daughter and her inexplicable mental illness which we\u2019ve both struggled to come to terms with. Even now we don\u2019t really accept that she\u2019s ill. We are both in denial. Even now. I think that\u2019s the problem. She doesn\u2019t feel understood.\n\nOver the years I have enjoyed the attention from men making me feel young and attractive. The more I got the more powerful I felt. I was glad that we still had sex because I knew as soon as that ended it would be very damaging and hard to keep us together. My dream was that you\u2019d allow an open relationship where I could have you and see other men but you made clear that wasn\u2019t acceptable. I was deluded of course. I thought you\u2019d love me enough to let me do what I needed to do and then once it was out of my system we\u2019d grow old together. As sad as that sounds.\n\nYou\u2019ve been a fantastic husband who has shown me love in so many ways. You\u2019ve tolerated, even supported my freedom. You\u2019ve even given me the adulation that I so desperately crave from others. You\u2019ve been the rock while I\u2019ve been the kite. I know you didn\u2019t want to be the rock. But you were. For me. You played second to me. It was either that or lose me and our family. What choice did you really have.\n\nMy friends have never shared what they think of you other than positive things. Of course they wonder what\u2019s really going on and how you put up with me I\u2019m sure. Who can blame them. Who wouldn\u2019t. We all talk about each other. We are all flawed. Even dysfunctional. Most people are I\u2019ve come to realise. But we all accept each other and come together with love whenever we can. Look at the football. They all want to meet up. They don\u2019t have to. And you\u2019re part of that. It\u2019s brought me a lot of pleasure and happiness. Im sure they judge me more than they judge you. But I don\u2019t care as they are still my friends. However strange a set up it is.\n\nI have nothing but love for you. Whatever happens I want to see you happy. Preferably with me but if not then without. I know it\u2019s mostly my fault. I\u2019m selfish and shallow and not dealing well with getting older. I\u2019m not the first to go through this. Or the last. At least my crisis has been fun and joyous and exciting for me and others. Harder for you I know.\n\nI blame you for not fighting me harder for what you wanted. For being scared to tell me what you really feel and think. For not keeping the dialogue open. Which I too am guilty of by the way. For ignoring my cries for help. And me for ignoring your increasing sadness. But I know that you didn\u2019t want to rock the boat for fear of losing me. So I don\u2019t really blame you.\n\nBut now I can no longer appear to juggle family and partying and work and traveling and my daughter . Because the small but hugely significant cog of sexual attraction and love making appears to have gone. I don\u2019t know if it it will come back for me. It would certainly make both our lives easier and happier if it did. Although we\u2019ve still got issues it would cover the cracks as it has done. And as you say bring closeness.\n\nI don\u2019t think divorce or throwing it all away in 5 mins is the answer. I think we have some issues to discuss and try to resolve first. I actually don\u2019t think focussing on sex is the answer. But instead our daughter, our friendship and talking and properly sharing how we truly feel. What we want from life. Our desires. We have one life and it\u2019s slipping away. I\u2019d like to travel and discover things. Not just work and party. I want to meet people and form new friendships. That makes me happy. I want to know what makes you happy. I actually don\u2019t know for sure anymore what that is. Maybe they are really different things and we\u2019ve grown apart it tou don\u2019t want to compromise on the things that you want to do anymore.\n\nI want us to truly understand our daughter and what she\u2019s going through. Like a project. Like when you met me and sussed out my hormones; logically as you\u2019re so good at. You\u2019re more emotional now which clouds your judgement. But together we can crack this. Apart will cause damage.\n\nI want you to fix your body. Get your hip done. Have thyroid checks. Take care of yourself. Feel good and confident. Your health will take you over if you\u2019re not careful. And our health is essential for a happy life.\n\nMy fear is that we split and like \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* (her former boyfriend, whom she dumped for me), you do all these things once you\u2019re out from under my shadow.\n\nYou\u2019re my best friend. I\u2019ve never hated you. We don\u2019t really argue much. When we do stuff together we have a great time. that festival is a great example. We had so much fun together. I want us to have some joint aspects but a lot of independence and freedom from each other to develop as individuals. Maybe then the sexual side will come back. I don\u2019t know if course. Maybe it won\u2019t. Maybe you\u2019ll want to leave me. Maybe I\u2019m being really naive. Maybe it\u2019s over and we\u2019ll both be happier apart in the long run. Maybe we won\u2019t and we\u2019ll \\*\\*\\*\\* up our daughter even more than she is.\n\nI see the next few years as crucial for her. Her GCSEs. 6th form and then university.

He fantasizes about using heroin. And I\u2019m just a filler for his time until he does again. I finally am getting so dead inside that I may not care about him anymore. Almost as little as I care about myself. I\u2019m getting so close. I just hope that I\u2019m worth something when he\u2019s finally decided that my begging him to leave is enough to finally leave. \n\nI will never allow someone to live with me again. That much has scarred me for life from this experience. He makes it like I forced him to live with me so any consequence of breaking his lease and not paying bills is my fault. We BOTH decided it would help to just live together financially. I never thought it would be like this. I would never have asked him to fuck up his credit or ruin his rental history. Even though he already ruined those prior to me. But somehow this one decision is all my fault. And this forces me to bear all the financial burden if he has to live on his again. Despite me paying 80 percent of the bills the past 7-8 months. None of that matters. Just that now he will have to possibly be an adult on his own. Which he somehow managed before we met. \n\nIf I could just leave I would. Unfortunately his stuff is here and I can\u2019t just kick him out. It\u2019s not that simple. I just want someone happy and excited to be with me. I don\u2019t need a lot. But he makes me think I\u2019m insane for just wanting basic normal love. He says I\u2019ll regret ending this.

And he will meet some young girl and pay for her and be generous. I\u2019ll be the one out thousand upon thousands of dollars out and made to feel like a gold digger just for asking for something once every 10 times I pay for everything .

{"post_id": "dnngd3", "created_utc": 1572142917, "title": "Was I discarded? Or am I the narc discarding him?", "author": "hfxredditor7", "self_text": "Hi guys,\n\n  \nI've been almost obsessively reading this sub in this last few days, and I feel like I might need some insight into my story. I'm sorry in advance if it's a little long. I feel like I am going crazy, and have been going crazy for a while now. I don't know if it's me, him, or a combination of both of us. He has a lot of classic narc behaviours, but then sometimes he does not. It's confusing. \n\nTo give a little background, I've been with my n(ex?) since Dec of 2017. At the time, I had just previously come out of an another abusive relationship that had lasted almost 2.5 years. I moved out on my own in Aug 2017 and started working 2 jobs (8-12 at one, 1-9 at the other, M-F and all day Saturday shift) to make ends meet. And even with 2 jobs, this was still next to impossible as I have a lot of debt, and multiple student loans/line of credit I am still repaying. I was eating very little, and barely made enough to pay all my bills every month. \n\nI signed up for an online dating website, mostly to find an FWB with no interest of a relationship as I was still hurting and felt the need to protect myself from an emotional level. I also didn't have much time for that aspect of my life. Forward to a few months later, here enters my nex, R. Both of us (26f and 31m at the time) are immigrants from bordering countries in Europe, speak the same language, and have similar cultural backgrounds. \n\nR messaged me on this site, we talked for a few days and then decided to meet in person. When he first entered my life, looking back on it, I think I was love bombed. His work schedule had him up for work at 4:30 AM and done by 2-3PM, and I worked until 9 PM, and he would still come over to my place. For my 1-9 full time job, I worked from home, so as soon he was done work he would come over and spend the entire time with me in the other room.  Within a couple weeks, he ended up moving in with me; an idea that stemmed from both of us. It was easier on him as he was sleeping over pretty much every night anyway, and the only time we could actually spend together was after I was done work at 9. So we would be up until 12-1 AM, and he'd have to be up for work in a couple hours. \n\nHe would cook for me every single night, he would buy me flowers, chocolates, jewelry, take me out on expensive dates.   I fell for him so quickly, he swept me off my feet and I was sure he was the one. He was so attentive and so kind, he was everything that my ex had not been. He was very giving from a sexual standpoint, constantly complimented me and said how sexy he finds me. Eventually we decided to move in together in a different apartment , in March 2018. By this point, I had already been seeing some warning signs that I mostly tried to put in the back of my mind. I am a person who does not like confrontation, I struggle with GAD, depression, and panic disorder. Also, I was convinced that it was worth it because you have to give a little, and compromise in a relationship. \n\nAfter we moved in together, a few months later he got a 2nd job and was working one full time and one part time. He justified the need for a second job so we could \"go out and do things without having to worry about money\". He paid more than me towards bills/groceries, about 60/40 split. He also paid for a few of my medical bills, and for some of the food for my dog (he loves my dog, this much I am still sure of - again, not classic narc behaviour). In return, my whole life revolved around house work and chores, cooking and ensuring it is clean while also working full time  (I work from home). We never even had the time to spend the money. I did not have my 2nd job anymore since before moving in together in the new apartment, because of conflict of interest -  I was working for 2 companies both in financial services simultaneously. \n\nThe thing that f\\*\\*\\*s with my mind is that one thing he always was, was generous with money. This contradicts what you would normally see in narcs. It's the way he went about it. He would basically gouge my eyes out over the fact that he works 2 jobs, constantly made me feel guilty like it's my fault, and I asked him to. He really likes money and he really likes having it, he's a very materialistic person and I am not. \n\nI accepted things the way they were, I did my duties. He did absolutely nothing other than work his 2 jobs, sleep, and eat. I understand, he was tired and cranky - and the jobs he did were not easy. On the weekends, he worked more hours than he slept. I supported him any way I could to ensure he didn't have to worry about anything at home because he had so little time. \n\nIn January 2019, with a couple of weeks notice, he decided that he would bring his cousin here from Europe to work where he works. We had quite a bit of back and forth about this, I initially hesitantly accepted because I didn't think he would go through with it, and also I was feeling pretty insecure about how he would react if I said no - he was putting more money than me into the household, after all. Eventually I told him it was not a good idea, but he said it's too late it's already a done deal. \n\nSo here enters, his 27m cousin right into our lives, less than 1 year after him and I moved into that apartment together. We had a 2 bedroom because I work from home and I needed a separate work space. I had to move my desk and work out of the living room, and his cousin got the 2nd bedroom. His cousin was not able to get the paperwork together to work right away, so up until late June he did not work. He was at home with me every single day while I worked. R and I sustained him on our salaries, he came with a bit of money saved up which he ran out of within 2-3 months. He eventually started working, and that's when R quit his 2nd job. \n\nThis is when things started going downhill really quickly for us. I thought that him quitting his 2nd job would be a way for us to connect, and communicate better and boy, was I wrong. His habits around the house remained similar to when he was working 2 jobs, as did his attitude and his reactions to situations. Things have just escalated from there over the last few months, and now I find myself here thinking maybe I am the crazy one. \n\nSome examples of interactions/behaviours with R:\n\n\\- I had to go to sleep at the same time as him, even though we were on completely different work schedules. He was getting up for work before 5AM, and I didn't have a start time for work on a rotating basis any time between 8AM and 1PM. I pushed back on this a lot. Eventually I gave up on the idea that I'm allowed to stay up later than him after he goes to sleep, so I adjusted to his schedule of going to sleep at 830-930PM every night, regardless of my work schedule. My body cannot handle more than 6/7 hours of sleep, sometimes less. As a result, I'd go to bed with him and wake up at the same time as him at 430-5AM, even on the weeks when I worked until 9 PM. When I worked until 9PM, I was allowed a couple of nights per week to stay up later, but most nights I had to be in bed with him, within an hour of finishing work. \n\n\\- He is under the impression that the world owes him and he is the best, most helpful person. He constantly talks about he is the only one running the restaurant kitchen where he works and no one else cares, he talks down to all his employees and even his boss, he yells and belittles them. He sends me messages about how he's gonna kill this person or get the fired if it's the last thing he does. \n\n\\- He wants to be recognized for every single thing he does, and wants that person to be forever in debt to him. He does not comprehend the idea of doing something for someone because he wants to help, there is always an ulterior motive. I've watched him interact with his mother in this manner too, and 90% of the time he is yelling/guilt tripping her over something he helped her with. Another great examples of this is, one of his coworkers I became very good friends with and she's been very supportive towards me but still interacts with R. A while back, she was temporarily without a car and R would drive her where she needed to go. She has a car now, but he messaged her saying \"you still owe me rides\". The coworker jokingly asked \"am I forever in debt to you?\", at which point he replied with \"I was doing it to help you, I don't need anything in return\". \n\n\\- He constantly belittles me and makes fun of my job because it's an \"office job/paper pusher\". Since I've been with him, I've gotten 2 promotions, the most recent one starting as of next week. The most recent one I got was quite big, and I was so proud of myself for the first time in a long time. When I found out a couple of weeks ago I got the job, I had to be the one to ask him \"hey we should go out an celebrate!\", and he just replied with \"what do you wanna do?\". I did not end up giving him an answer, and he came home in a huff and puff because he was \"already mad at me for something I had said\" (which I wasn't aware of at this point), but decided to push it aside and ask what I want to to do, and I couldn't bother replying to him.  (BTW, the irony in all this is that he's currently in the process of applying for \"paper pusher\" jobs himself because he doesn't want to work at his job anymore that he's been at for the last 5+ years). \n\n\\- He often insults my intelligence, my political/moral views, and consistently invalidates my struggles. It does not matter what I am going through, it is nothing compared to what he's going through. \n\n\\- He gets so MAD if I don't answer the phone right away, or take too long to answer a text message. I am at home the majority of the time since I work from home, and feels like he can call whenever. Sometimes I just don't pick up the phone if it's during work. But on the weekend, I am usually doing chores, and my phone is on silent somewhere and I don't hear it. I'll check it every 15-20 mins but that's not enough time for R. He also gets upset if it takes too many rings to pick up the phone and questions me \"what were you doing that it took you X rings to pick up the phone?\"\n\n\\- I have isolated myself from the majority of my friends, and I've lost interest in all my hobbies. One thing I used to really enjoy was playing World of Warcraft (not a crazy addiction, it was just my relaxing time after work while watching TV). I eventually stopped playing it within a few months of being with him because he would just say it's a waste of time and I could spend it doing better things. Since together, I've tried to push back a few times and said \"I think I'm gonna get back into WoW again, and his reactions were over the top every single time. We would get in fights about it. \n\n\\- I have not started playing WoW again, but I have started to try and get out a little more to spend time with my friends on the weekend. This is slowly something that has started to make him unravel, he complained to me how every Saturday night (exaggeration) he goes to bed alone because I'm not there/home yet. I don't go out to party, I've gone for sleepovers at his coworker's (more so my friend's) place a few times in the last months on Saturdays. And there is where I can get a little relief, a little peace, and recharge myself to deal with another week of this. We just sit around and toke, and chat about life. When he brought this up to me, I told him \"I don't understand, you work Sunday mornings anyway - and I am home 6/7 nights per week, I don't go out unless I have an appointment and spend every night with you after work just watching TV.\" His response to me was \"OK you don't understand, you never will\".  Am I being cruel, am I in the wrong?\n\n\\- He constantly threatens that he will \"send me to live with my mother\" if I do something he does not approve of. Sometimes he does it jokingly like when one time I told him I want cut my shorter and he just said \"if it's too short, you can just go to live your mom\". \n\n\\- Our intimate time became less frequent while he was working 2 jobs (understandable), and has been non existent in the last 6-8 months. He never initiates and I got to a point where my self-esteem was so shot as a result that I stopped initiating as well. I told him on multiple occasions that I would like it if we showed he wanted me once in a while. He acknowledged it. Nothing ever changed. At the beginning of our relationship I shared that I had this issue with my ex, and I would try all I could to go down on him, etc. R resented me because of this, because he knew that when the same thing happened with my ex, I basically continued to beg for his attention from a sexual standpoint. His words \"YOU'RE the one who shared this with me, you should have thought better\". He would take a lot of stabs at the fact that I stopped doing it as often, and would use the story I shared about my ex and say \"and he wasn't even good to you and didn't do half the things I do, but you would give him bjs\". \n\n\\- Another recent incident that threw me completely off guard, one night I decided to go down on him but I told him my stomach was not feeling well (he knew this from earlier in the day as I hadn't eaten anything) so I don't know if I could do it for long. While in the act he just replies \"Yeah I know it's a once a month thing\". I kept going anyway even though hearing those words just made me feel like an object. \n\n\\- We got to where we are now, because in the last few months I've started pushing back more and more. Until recently, I did not understand/realize what's happening. He told me he is unhappy because I've \"changed\", even shed a few tears one night when we talked. The only thing I've done differently, is that I am more confident in my answers, and I've started calling him out on his BS. My ex was also on the N spectrum, but it took me leaving the environment for a few days for it to click in. \n\nAnother heated exchange of messages occurred the other day, during which I once again asked him to please respect my boundaries and let me be myself. Let me interact with friends, let me pursue my hobbies, let me follow my work schedule - just let me do normal things that adults in relationships do, because they understand that happiness and fulfillment doesn't come from one single source. I told him he made me feel guilty for every single decision I make, and I often times found myself feeling a lot of fear/doubt as to whether my decision will affect his reaction (as I did not want one). I told him, he will never fundamentally understand that love is not this measurable, quantifiable object like a piece of bread that is cut into pieces and eventually you run out of pieces to give people. Just because someone is not with you 24/7 at your disposal, does not mean they love you less, or value you less. \n\nAmong all this, he told me that he's the one who \"gave me a chance\" and let me go have excitement and rest (I am at my mom's, about an hour drive away from him), and that I'd come back down to earth and realize I need to come home and change and go back to the way I was before (before, he broke me down, he means - or maybe before I started calling him out). We stopped talking for a day, and then he sent me this email:\n\n\"*You know i never thought that i would hear and read so much hatred from you towards me . I believe i am worst for you and with you then your ex. I guess i didn't do enough for u and didn't give u enough but i dont have anything more to give. I dont want to be with someone who despises me and hates me and is afraid of me for some reason.i know i am not a bad man because u forgot but i helped u a lot and didn't ask for nothing in return. Unfortunately i can't give u what u ask\u00a0 and i wont expect anything back from you.let me know about the arrangements u want to make nice and peacefully . And i am sorry.*\"\n\nI... have not cut contact with him yet. We are talking minimally. Sent him a couple pictures of the dog. I emailed him rent info today and he texted me and asked me how much he had to pay (as I was the one taking care of this), then wanted to continue the conversation. I didn't reply for hour and half, in the timespan which he sent me 4 messages telling me I don't talk to him, and through 2 different contact methods. I told him I was staying away from my phone a little, and he said \"if you want to talk, you can text me, goodnight\". \n\nI love him. I miss him, and I want to go back to him. Even as I am sitting here, way past the time I would normally be able to sleep, watching my favourite tv show which I haven't done so in ages... I still want to go back. I don't understand. Did I cause this, and ruin our relationship? Should I have just continued to let things go? Maybe he will change, or maybe it's all in my head.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

{"post_id": "dnobic", "created_utc": 1572148020, "title": "Advice for coping with abusive Nprofessor for the next 7 months", "author": "PeaksoftheTwindustry", "self_text": "Hi Everyone,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry in advanced...this is going to be very long. \n\nI'm currently in a very small major program at a public university, and am a quarter done with my senior year. I'm having a difficult time managing my stress surrounding a teacher at school who acted abusively towards me last semester, as I found out this week that he has been spreading lies about me to my peers behind closed doors. Because my major is incredibly intimate due to size, we have 2 full-time faculty and only one of them is tenured &amp; \"in charge\" of most department related decisions. This is the Nprofessor that I will be talking about from here on out. \n\nFor relevant context, I am a several time survivor of past long-term abuse from partners and one particular teacher (who was an intense Sociopath who fixated on abusing me for over a year), and have C-PTSD and depression. At the beginning of my Junior year, I had my first class with Nprofessor, and quickly started to pick up on red flag behaviors that made me begin to put up physical and personal boundaries when in his presence over time. This included things such as: Him talking excessively about his achievements/views/opinions, going on off-topic tangents about said opinions for 30min-2hours during lecture, having poor boundaries with students (giving out his phone number to his favorites, calling them for hours to complain about other students at night/on weekends, etc), and only ever talking about himself without letting you get a word into the 'conversation'. He was fixated on his annoyance of other faculty and students he perceived to be 'lazy' 'ungrateful' and 'unprofessional', going as far as mocking people to the entire class as soon as they left to use the restroom and attempting to grill them in front of others when they came back in. \n\nAt some point a few of my friends and I were...groomed...to be part of the group of students that he openly favored in class, and were often pulled into his office to discuss our projects and career opportunities. At least that's what he said before he started going on long tangents about how the other faculty were working together behind his back to get their \"friends\" hired into the department, and several other conspiracy theories he had about them undermining his authority. He also openly shared extremely personal information that other students had confided in him (such as who was suicidal, who had what personal hardship, etc) as a way of making us feel pressured to share personal information with him, even though he clearly would only collect this information to hold against people later instead of actually having empathy. I admitted that I was dealing with a particular health issue during one of the weeks I had a meeting with him, as I had missed school due to having surgery, and he ended up (without mentioning my name) talking about this in front of the entire class to give an example of students being lazy and not coming to class because they can't deal with their problems correctly. I felt so humiliated and ashamed for disclosing this information that I began avoiding him altogether. \n\nDuring last semester, I had 2 classes with him that were each 6 hour lectures. I became so exhausted by his increasingly erratic and aggressive behavior at school that I began taking anti-anxiety medication for the first time in 6 years. This man was clearly great at trapping people into his web and then antagonizing students for leaving, questioning him, or actually communicating boundaries. It got so incessant that I would just get up and leave when he wouldn't stop talking to me in the labs where we do homework. I stopped doing my work at school because I didn't want to run into him, and I began confiding in my friends about my feelings, which turned out to be shared by a large group of other students (although he certainly has strong fans as well). Towards the end of the semester I was trying to do a promotional shout-out for a film showcase that my club was putting on (related to our major), and he changed the subject to pester me about a film project his other class had worked on together that he believed was going to be played first in our showcase line up. I calmly explained to him that we were selecting our own order of videos, and that he had not asked us or met with us to discuss his class project. He lost his shit and began saying how bad of listeners me and my fellow club officers were, how he had been working on this for years (what?!), and how angry he was that we wouldn't do what he \"had been telling the class for weeks\". I used some de-escalation skills to get him to simmer down after going back and forth, but eventually he started to interject me anytime I responded by putting his hand in front of my face and yelling \"THIS IS NOT A NEGOTIATION! YOU NEED TO LISTEN TO ME!\".  This went on until I asked him why he was telling our club what to do if he had no affiliation with us, to which he stood over me physically (I was sitting in a computer chair), got his face close to mine, and screamed at me that he was the teacher. He pointed his finger towards the hallway and screamed at me that I \"needed\" to go talk to him outside. I told him that I was uncomfortable. He repeated himself louder, and I did the same. He stormed out of the room, and I left to have an hour long meeting with his supervisor about his behavior.\n\nThis all happened in front of 20 other students, several of which I had sign a document outlining everything that was said and done during this incident as witnesses. I had this document added to his personnel file, but was told that there was nothing that could be done other than the Chair of the department giving him a verbal warning. If he persisted in antagonizing me I was allowed to open a formal grievance against him and the department, but we mutually decided to ignore each other until the last week of class.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow...I have had a lot of time to process and deal with my own feelings about this incident over the summer, and had finally moved into a place of letting go of my anger so that I could focus on finishing my degree this year. Luckily for me I don't have to take any more courses with Nprofessor, but I do have to see him around since I also do work-study in the labs for my major. Everything has started flooding back to me after someone in one of his classes came and told me that he was talking about me to them, and totally changing the story of what happened. He has apparently been telling people that I am a \"mentally ill, disgruntled student\" who has been \"slandering\" him online (where?!?!) and that I tried to turn the department against him. I want to get back to a place of letting go and moving on, but I feel like this just re-opened my wounds of being gaslit and abused by people in positions of power. I don't know how to deal with this other than to try and ignore him, but it's fucking hard not to want to know what other things he's telling students about me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat would you do if you had to see his face for another 7 months?

The moment I saw him I had a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach, something just felt off about the guy from the get-go and of course he got seated in my section. He was well dressed and handsome but with an eerie silence about him, not angry or rude but just this weird nothingness about his presence that was so unsettling. He was there with his mother and he order the same exact drink and same exact entree as her (my nex was a \"mama's boy\" too) and was very aloof and unengaging to talk to. Despite being eerily silent, his mother seemed to be walking on eggshells around him. He did not give me any real trouble though, so I tried to brush off the bad vibes I was getting from him and chalked it up to his resemblance to my nex. Maybe I was overreacting. \n\nFlash forward to when they got up to leave and the hostess (a shy, tiny 15 year old girl) came scurrying up to me and whispered \"That guy really creeps me out!\" I pressed her for details and she tells me about the following interaction:\n\nQuiet dude was staring blankly at the hostess from across the room and then got up and approached the host stand alone. Towering over her, he looked down at the stand and saw a box of mints. \n\nHe asked \"Can I have one?\"\n\nShe said \"I don't know whose they are, so no.\"\n\nHe was silent for a moment, then asked again \"So can I have one?\"\n\nAgain she said no. Without saying anything, he picked up the tin of mints and took one. \n\nThen he mumbled to himself \"You can't ask for mints.\" and walked out. \n\nShe said that the way he spoke was odd and quiet and she felt scared and confused by his behavior, which is exactly how I felt around my nex. When I heard this I felt angry and despite the brief interaction I had with this individual I am left feeling disturbed as though my nex himself had been there tonight. I think the worst part of this entire situation is the fact that, despite the alarm bells blaring at the sight of this guy, there was a part of me that was instantly drawn to him too and I found myself wanting to work harder to make sure I took good care of his table to impress him, and I had to hold myself back from doing so. After all, if I ran into my nex would I just suddenly bend over backwards for him again despite all he's done to me? There was a time when I would've found such an odd, aloof type of guy to be intoxicating and tonight I had to fight the part of myself that wanted his attention. It's just a weird concoction of emotions that have been stirred up - sadness, disgust, insecurity, anger, self-loathing, a desire to please. I was proud of the hostess for picking up on this guy's creepiness and telling him no, and at the same time I was disappointed in myself for having fell for a similar narc that even a 15 year old girl could've sniffed one out from across a room. Then again, at least I did pick up on *this* guy's creepiness and avoided going out of my way to please him. I just hate that I felt attracted to him at all.  \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to get this off my chest and share. Maybe some of you can relate to this situation.

I'm not sure when it started but my older brother would make me engage in sexual acts (including him forcing me to receive oral sex and penetration and forcing me to perform oral sex.) When I got older and learned it was wrong he stopped doing it, scared I would tell someone I'm guessing. Though there was an occasion where he came into my room asking me to strip for him, I began to have an anxiety attack and bluntly said no. As he turned to leave my room I saw he had his phone with him, it on and recording. I'm guessing, he was going to blackmail me with my nude body if I had given in and stripped. I would look outside my window frequently to see him standing there when I was laying on my bed, he played this off as a prank.\n\n I'm not sure what I went through was rape, I'm guessing it is but at my young age I didn't really know what it was and would just go along with it as if I did I was rewarded with his attention or him doing chores for me. At the time of the abuse my parents were fighting daily, my dad physically and verbally abusive my mother almost as bad. I witnessed my mother being pushed to a bed and punched repeatedly, I don't remember crying or feeling anything to witnessing that. I just waited for it to stop. I'm rambling, sorry.\n\nA couple of years ago when I just started to realize 'Oh that was bad, that was really fucking bad' and my trauma began to haunt me, I became suicidal and went to a chat room. I talked about my trauma and situation and due to that CPS wanted an interview with me.  I remember being in a car as my parents drove me there, only telling me what was happening when I got into the car. My dad screaming, asking if he put it in me. I was sobbing and hyperventilating. I felt so dirty, and I felt in trouble. I was hysterical during the interview and they couldn't get any information out of me. Life went back to normal, my parents knew my brother had sexually assaulted me in some way as i lied to the interviewer saying he would come into my room and strip asking me to touch him. They didn't do anything. They treated me with less respect and didn't trust me, but nothing more.   \n\n\nI had frequent flashbacks, terrible anxiety, I was depressed and self-harming, I was always angry and I was very cruel to things weaker than me. I learned how to be manipulative to people to get them to do what I want. I was a terrible person. One night for whatever reason my brother came into my room I was dressed very scarcely as it was hot and I was about to sleep. My mother and father were there too but left shortly after I began to scream at him. Having a mental break down due to my extensive trauma. He just laughed. Eventually, I told him to just kill himself. He left my room and I slammed my door shut. He came back a minute or so later and punched a hole in my door. I then got in trouble despite I was just fucking terrified and wanted him gone, I was trying to protect myself in my havoc of overwhelming fear and emotion. My brother had anger issues and he began to be very physically threatening and scary. He is much taller than me and much stronger. One time when hanging out with a friend i turned off the wi-fi to annoy him, I got a sense of confidence when around my friends and used that time to get some 'revenge' on him. He stormed into my room dragged me from out under my bed sat on top of me and strangled me. I was sobbing and my friend witnessed it all. I played it off and laughed. I then got in trouble from my parents for turning off the wi-fi to annoy him despite them knowing he had just strangled me.\n\nI'm not sure why but one night I got my mum in my room and tried to tell her everything. I was very scarce about the details but I got the point across. Something like \"You know how I was interviewed all those years ago? Yeah, it happened.\" Although it wasn't that clear, I was sobbing, hiding and suffocating under my sheets and hyperventilating. My mother kept touching me trying to get me to show my face as I had a panic attack. She got my father in who tried to force me to get out, looking back on it I was probably about to pass out from lack of oxygen and hyperventilating. But stopped when I began to scream. Just scream. It was muffled but I just continued to scream until they stopped. She said that 'as a family, were going to get through this.' I hated that. It's just so disgusting to me. Family? As a family? HE isn't my fucking family. But I digress.   \nThey still treated him like a son, he never was punished or anything. Its terrible. I hate it.   \n\n\nMy brother graduated a few days ago. The crushing realization that he would probably never be punished or reap the consequences for something that has certainly ruined my entire fucking life. And despite being clean for a few months I relapsed and self-harmed quite severely.  I don't know how I feel. One moment, i hate him, i hate him so fucking much and i just want to kill him. Stab him until the life drains from his eyes. On the other hand. I don't hate him. He's my brother. And it's probably 'my' fault. Sometimes I see them as different people, the monster and him. Although he probably doesn't, I hope he's sorry and I hope hes guilty. I hope that as I calmed him down from a panic attack due to our parent's drug addiction coming to light he was crushed with guilt that I only know how to calm someone down because of my suffering caused by him. That because of him I have to suffer from a bouquet of mental problems. I don't know if he is though. Considering he never shows a hint of guilt and the fact he threatened to murder me if i tried to get him in trouble. I'm not sure if I want to get him in trouble though, only the monster.

Shouldn\u2019t I have known better? \n\nSo I thought and thought and thought and finally can pinpoint the first time CPS ever came to my house. \nI was 5 years old and the social workers took me into our bedroom to ask me questions. I showed them the child size plastic hockey stick that was hidden away, my mum used it to beat my younger brother and I. Nothing happened that day, except after they left my mom beat me for telling them and then both parents told me I would never see them again if I told them it happened again. Throughout the years, out of fear of never seeing the people I thought were the only ones who loved and cared for me (as they\u2019ve always told me), I never told CPS again. Every time there was a visit, mom and dad would remind us not to say anything or else we would be taken by the government. I wish I said something. It\u2019s funny because throughout the years I\u2019d accidentally tell a close adult such as a teacher or therapist about some form of abuse and instantly downplayed it and lied whenever CPS was sent from that encounter. I was scared for my brothers because they didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with the abuse, they loved my parents and I\u2019m sure they would\u2019ve hated me for separating all of us. They also had their chance and lied as well... but sometimes I feel so guilty because I\u2019m the oldest. I know better than them. What if we all would have turned out better for it? My brothers and I have suffered so much and honestly now I feel so fucking bad for not standing up earlier. At 13, I finally fought back and eventually my brothers did too years later, when they gained the courage. It\u2019s stopped now as were all in our teens but mom will occasionally take a hanger or belt to my brothers. To this day, my mom has tried to deny ever laying a hand on us and I hate her so much for that. \u201cDid anyone ever see marks on you? Do you have any scars? I didn\u2019t touch you.\u201d I\u2019m sobbing as I remember. It\u2019s like I forgot I wasn\u2019t the only one she was beating and I was so shocked but then we got home and I told my brother and he had my back. My mom was in denial and upset that we were making her feel guilty. What kind of behaviour is this? Another thing that bothers me is that growing up in a desi community, she was able to justify the physical abuse by saying its normal (and I guess in some sense in our culture it is) and man I thought it was okay, all my friends were getting beat too so it\u2019s cool. \n\nBut now, I know that she KNEW what she was doing wrong and kept doing it anyway. The fact that CPS was involved and her and my father worked together to manipulate us into omitting the abuse, it\u2019s enough for me to not justify it by generational trauma. She could\u2019ve stopped it. She knew it was a bad thing. She did it for at least 10 years of my own life, and more of my brothers. Whatever she could find. Over the tiniest things.

She was hilarious and we laughed like crazy, had passionate sex, and really connected. It was perfect. After that was I lovebombed with a morning text at 7am every morning, I felt so special, she made me feel amazing. A month went by and things were great. I thought she was the one, a keeper.\n\nThen we went to a wine festival and drank.... We went back home, I was drunk and she stopped me mid sex. She said, \"Stop, You're awkward during sex and you have no rhythm\", and she walked outside and told me, \"don't talk to me\".\n\nI was confused, I'd never heard of anyone saying anything nearly as cold to someone they supposedly cared about.\n\nI felt like kicking her out, but I didn't want to be that mean to a woman....\n\nLater she apologized and told me she had trust issues and thought that I had other girls and only wanted to sleep with her. She asked to go through my phone and I told her fine and whatever, I had nothing to hide.\n\nShe found nothing, then texted giving a half assed apology. I was still steamed over what she said.... Over the phone I said, \"what would you do if someone told that to you mid sex, she says, \"not to sound like an asshole, but I wouldn't believe them because i'm too good\".\n\nImmediately I felt self conscious and like something was wrong with me. It scarred me. I thought about breaking up with her but pushed through.\n\nThe next morning she told me she had one rule, \"never tell her a lie\".\n\nWell, I had lied to her about college before we met. It was the single only lie I ever told her and I didn't want to see that crazy rage from the night before. I know its wrong, but I was afraid of people judging me. We carried on, but when I brought up what she said and how it hurt me, she said, \"we've moved on\", and \"its in the past\", then she hung up on me to do the dishes..... The dishes?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the phone before a trip we took out of town, she was interrogating me about college. I came clean and told her the truth, and then she went silent and hung up. She lashed out, said many mean things, and I apologized over and over. It was a bad thing to do and I told her it was because of insecurity. Even though I had a good job, I was afraid of being judged because of it. I was working on finishing up this year while working.\n\nShe withdrew affection, was incredibly cold, and just wasn't quite there after that. Said I hurt her \"the worst way possible\".\n\nNext week we went on vacation and the 4 hour plane ride she was absolutely silent. the Hour uber ride, didn't even say a word. Then getting food, the first thing she said was, \"If you ever lie to me again, even about the food you eat, you'll never talk to me again\".\n\nSo for the rest of the weekend we had a great time, she was however, very cold to me. She said she was single at an event at another festival we went to during a whiskey tasting. She said, \"go away\" when she was sick and I checked on her, and she said, \"whatever\" and walked away when I brought her some food. I began to start doubting myself.\n\nShe said earlier that there were only two types of people, those who lied to her, and her two best friends who never did, and she can't stand people who lie to her, even her parents. She was treating me like she now hated me....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter the trip we went back, she said she had a great time, but she refused to get intimate and said she was tired. I've been getting a racing heartbeat during the middle of the night the past three weeks. It's been awful. I woke up and she said, \"what the heck do you want me to do?\" and turned over. The next morning she interrogated me again about my past, and i told her everything again.\n\nShe was affectionate the next day, but sent only five texts the next week, and didn't call, which was way different from calling everyday....\n\nSo finally I reached out and asked what the deal was. She called me up crying saying I lied again. I said what are you talking about? And she brought up how I told her I took a trip but never told her how long it was. She said she cried all vacation and I ruined her vacation, and that she can't focus working at school because she was hurt too bad for me.\n\nThat now she'd have to talk to her therapist about me for the next few years since I hurt her so bad.\n\nI apologized and listened to her talk down to me and over me for an hour. Then it hit me. I told her she lied about her feelings for a week to me and that it wasn't fair to me. She admitted I was right, and justified the lie by saying, \"I didn't want to be rude or hurt you and just leave\", and we haven't talked since then, but she told three lies in the last things she said to me. Said she was always upfront, Never didn't tell me anything, and never hid anything.\n\nI was thinking, isn't it hypocritical to have standards for others but to not obey those same standards yourself? Also, did she ever care about me? This made me think.\n\nShe said when I talked I was just like her ex now, and she was punishing me because of that one lie, to make me hurt like her grandma did, her parents, her ex made her hurt.

How great she made me feel, and how awful at the same time. I just never got why when I hurt her it's the end of the world, but if she hurt me it didn't matter. I was very empathetic to her, but she lacked any sort of empathy for me.\n\nHow do I get past this, and was she a possible narcissist? My friend who met her said she was.

He hoovered 6 months ago sending me a lovey dovey e-mail but then we had a conversation on the phone and I realized he never changed and never planned to do so. Blamed every little insignificant thing on me and yelled that my therapist is clearly an idiot because I\u2019m still the same. \nI am no contact since then, blocked all mutual friends, all his relatives and him of course. He didn\u2019t unfriend my relatives from his facebook account and now they\u2019re all shocked( he was basically part of my family and when we would visit he would always brag how he plans to marry me this year).

I have no one to talk to and I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. I began seeing my partner almost 4 years ago, i was so drawn to how he made me feel valued and worthy. Then, it all changed. We fought all the time about his priorities and how hurt i was that he rarely respected my feelings, and i cried more than i thought was possible. I worked as hard as i could do everything i could for him, to make him happy and make his life easier, because i thought he valued me and would care for me that way in return. He began putting everyone else ahead of me - both his best friend and his ex were more valuable to him than me, and all of my pleading and explaining my pain to him, in hopes it would matter to him, ended with an apology and a vow to never hurt me again. I left a few years ago after i continued to see that substances and his friends were still more important than me, even after i landed myself in the ER with a panic attack so severe I thought my heart was giving out, just due to my anxiety. When i left him, he changed. I found out he was now depressed, wouldnt speak to any of his friends or leave his bed, because I left. One day, i caved. Because i thought he would finally see my worth and realize what he was missing. He was so grateful to hear from me and begged me to give him one more chance, and I was so excited to. It all changed again. I spend what feels like hours a week explaining when i hurt and neglected, i\u2019ve sobbed my eyes out to him about how much it hurts seeing that my feelings don\u2019t matter to him still. He doesn\u2019t say he\u2019s sorry anymore, he stares blankly through me, or he\u2019ll burst into tears himself. Communicating my feelings does nothing, because they don\u2019t seem to matter. I\u2019ve explained and cried and been so vulnerable. I\u2019ve become so emotionally unwell and anxious.

I have a job I love, a beautiful room, and access to paints and cameras and instruments to do all the things I love to do. \n My problem is, I\u2019m starting to feel all of the pain I should\u2019ve felt years ago. All at once.\n\n I grew up with my grandparents for the first 3 years of my life. After that my mother and I moved in with a very racist man who physically abused her almost To the point of death. (I\u2019m half black, my mother is white) and who abused me too. \n My mother became an alcoholic and relied heavily on drugs. I\u2019ve blocked out a lot of these memories, but my grandmother does recall very concerning times when I would hide to avoid seeing him after visiting.\n After leaving him my mother got with another man who seemed more hopeful. \nAt first.\nI had a half sister at this point, and soon enough we moved in with this new man. They married. The first few years were great.\n Then the beatings began. \nHe had a paddle that he made out of an old tv shelf. He kept it on the back of the toilet. It seemed he was always finding a reason to tell us to bend over, so he could paddle us. If my room was a mess he\u2019d set a timer; if I didn\u2019t have it done in 15 minutes he\u2019d paddle my butt. If I snuck food, he\u2019d paddle my butt. And for years I thought that was normal. \nBut I don\u2019t think getting paddled every day is normal.\n  When I turned 15, he put a camera up in the food closet. I had 2 little half brothers at this point.\nMy brothers were allowed to whatever food they could put their hands on without punishment, but I had to ask for permission which was hardly ever given. No snacks for me. Just the three basic meals. If food was stolen, I\u2019d get paddled.\nMy phone was taken for silly things like using my phone while it was charging. My sister and I would be forced to do their laundry and my brothers laundry for hours (my brothers would call all their clothes dirty to avoid cleaning their bedroom)\nIf dishes weren\u2019t cleaned right, I\u2019d be forced to drink out of them.\nIf talking after bedtime I\u2019d be forced to drink hot sauce.\n Then he took my door, and added another camera in the hallway by my room. \n I was given a dress code. Any short shorts that I would wear just around the house, any tank tops I enjoyed wearing to bed, my mother threw away.\n He would come in after getting super drunk and, thinking I was asleep, put his hand on my stomach and stand there. For hours.\nWhen I was 17, I began self harming. My parents grounded me.\n\n I met an abusive boy which is another story entirely. It wasn\u2019t until I moved back in with my parents after he kicked me out that I feel the real abuse began.\n\nMy mother told me I deserved to be treated like a dog.  Because I\u2019d moved out and told my grandparents that they were abusive. So they refused to allow me to sleep on any furniture. I was 19, and had to sleep on the tile floor in the living room. All my belongings were to be shoved in a chest behind the recliner. I wasn\u2019t allowed to sleep on the couch. He put up 3 more cameras and I had to be given permission to enter any bedrooms. I\u2019ve never stolen, but my younger brothers were told to lock up their valuables and given safes to put them in.\nWhen they left the house, the food pantry, laundry room, and all bedrooms were locked. \nI realized at this point that he also had access to everything in my phone. He\u2019d banned my devices on the WiFi, but I noticed his email was the second email on my iTunes account. I changed it.\nI used a pair of kitchen scissors one day and forgot to put them back. That got me in a lot of trouble. I don\u2019t know why that, of all things, is the thing that bothers me the most. The kitchen scissors incident is when I realized that this wasn\u2019t normal.\nAt this point I\u2019m 19 years old and I\u2019d just realized this all wasn\u2019t NORMAL.\n My mother hit me after I snapped one day after I asked why someone took the keyboard to my computer. I\u2019d gone into my brothers room to get it, and got in trouble for it. I called my stepdad an asshole. Big mistake.\nThe next day he gave me an eviction notice. Best thing to ever happen to me.\n\nI moved in with my grandparents who were shocked. My mother had told them that I was terrible. On a lot of drugs(I smoked weed) and a whore. My grandparents didn\u2019t see anything wrong.\n\nBut now, I feel afraid. I cuss myself out when I do little things wrong, I feel like I\u2019m being watched, im not allowed to smoke anymore so I\u2019m always desperate to escape my own head. I got used to daydreaming to escape the verbal abuse and now I don\u2019t know how to pay attention. I just feel like I should be happy that I\u2019m out of that situation and I DO HAVE GOOD DAYS, but there\u2019s days like these where I feel like damaged goods. Like I\u2019m never going to be normal. I never had friends so it\u2019s hard for me to make them now. I talk ALOT, and I think it\u2019s a nervous thing, but I feel like I get on everybody\u2019s nerves. \n\nI\u2019m sorry. \nI\u2019m so sorry. \nI just really really had to get that off of my chest.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

The main points of criticism he has for me are definitely rooted in truth. He hates how messy I can be, I\u2019m not always great about cleaning up after myself right away but I do get to it, and I never expect him to do it for me. He also can be neglectful of his messes, like leaving dishes in sink, trimming his beard over a clean sink. I never get on his case because I understand life gets busy. But he gets in what I call \u201crage cleaning\u201d modes where he comes home pissed about something at work and looks for a fight, begins slamming dishes into the dishwasher (sometimes breaking them), and begins yelling at me to come help with the dishes and then begins berating me for never doing the dishes and never contributing around the house. I can count on one hand how many times he has cleaned the bathroom, or folded laundry, or swept, dusted, deep cleaned anything, but he fixates on the few chores that he actually does more often, like dishes and trash. I\u2019ve tried to create a chore chart to make things more obviously fair but it ended up with me doing chores on my days and him never doing chores. If I try to criticize him or point out how we are both contributing to a mess and we need to work on it together he turns it into being all about me, it\u2019s my fault. When I point out all of the chores I do that he doesn\u2019t acknowledge he says I don\u2019t deserve a pat of the back for doing what I\u2019m supposed to do. I\u2019m not asking for a pat on the back, I\u2019m asking to not be screamed at.\n\nWe have no children and no desire to have kids. We are both very passionate about our work and having having the freedom to travel. Another big point of contention is the fact that I have a later schedule than he does. Without going into specifics that might identify me, my line of work requires me to work later evenings. Until a recent job change my husband also worked late hours, and yet in fights he blames my job and my schedule as being the problem in our relationship, my job prevents us from spending time together. Sometimes I would come home from work and he would say it seemed like I stay at work so late to avoid him. This has sort of become a self fulfilling prophecy because now I actually do find myself staying at work later and later slowly doing my side work so I can avoid going home because I don\u2019t know what kind of mood he\u2019ll be in and if he\u2019s going to want to pick a fight.\n\nI also have had quite a bit of success in my industry over the past few years and I am somewhat of a recognized persona within my field. He has commented multiple times about how he wished he had the same kind of recognition in his industry and is desperate for a job with a leadership role. He\u2019s never happy at his current job because he feels undervalued everywhere and feels like he deserves a bigger title and bigger salary everywhere he goes. Because of this he has changed jobs pretty much once a year since We\u2019ve been together (about 7 years). With my work I\u2019ve gotten a lot of opportunities to travel and present at trade shows and educational events, all of these things to him are proof that our relationship has been all about me going after my dreams and not letting him go after his. I\u2019ve never held him back or discouraged him from anything, I\u2019ve always tried to support him and tell him how talented I think he is and he deserves to do what makes him happy. \n\nIronically, even though my job has always been a problem because it \u201cprevents us from spending time together.\u201d His current job has an opening at their HQ in Arizona and he wants to take the position. I cannot move because of my job and so he wants to have a long distance marriage and will not hear any of my concerns about it, any concerns have been meant with blowout level rage with him yelling at me that he supported me in my career and I refuse to support him. So our relationship doesn\u2019t make home happy because I don\u2019t spend enough time with him and the solution is for him to move across the country?\n\nIf feels like the criticism is valid at times but when I actually take the time to think about the whole situation is feels like a bunch of double standards. Plus when he is unhappy with something I do according to him it\u2019s because I don\u2019t actually love or care about him, or our house. It always seems like reactions are disproportionate to the situation. Me leaving dishes in the sink means I don\u2019t care about him, my love for my work is me not caring about him. When I try to share with him how anxious and depressed I\u2019ve become he will be supportive at first and then begins feeling angry and says there is nothing wrong with me, I\u2019m just manipulative (in the same conversation!) I feel like I can\u2019t even share stories about my day with him because he will find something to criticize me about, which I\u2019ve learned when that happens I need to shut up, or change the subject, disagreeing or defending myself will end up with a fight with him dragging every instance of me being a shitty person into the mix, including using insecurities I\u2019ve confided to him as ammo.\n\nSometimes he will seem to realize he was in the wrong and apologize, but most of these horses will get dragged out and beaten yet again in another argument.\n\nI\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019m to the point where I don\u2019t care whose right and whose wrong I just want to encourage him to take the AZ job and move away so I can cut it off more easily.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I have a very limited knowledge of what emotional abuse consists of, and this very well could not be abuse. Thank you :)\n\nI won't disclose my age but I am young, if that's important. My girlfriend recently broke up with me but I wish I would've had the guts to do it before. Here's some things that she did to me that made me upset/uncomfortable/etc.\n\n1. She'd look through my phone pretty much every day. I would physically try to take it back from her and she wouldn't let me. I would ask her not to and she would say something like \"then you must have something to hide.\" She'd look through my photos, texts, snapchat, and I hated it.\n\n2. She consistently brought up subjects I was uncomfortable with. For an example, I opened up to her about the fact that I used to watch p*rn when I was younger. I hate that fact more than anything and I was open about how ashamed and embarrassed I was. Yet she would CONSTANTLY bring it up. It made me hate myself more than I already do (side note, we're both clinically depressed)\n\n3. She made fun of me for how I dressed. I've never really cared about the way I dress, if that makes sense. I care enough not to wear the same clothes every day or have some sort of style, but I've always just done my own thing. She always laughed at me and told me everything about my outfit and makeup that was wrong.  It honestly really embarrassed me.\n\n4. She'd get insanely mad if I hung out with other people. I've never had many friends but I did use to consistently hang out with them. There was a girl that hit on me one day, not knowing I had a girlfriend. I thought the girl was really cool and wanted to be friends. She'd written me a note asking me out, which I thought was really cute. I showed my girlfriend and she immediately stole it and wouldn't let me have it. I was sad but never tried for a friendship with her because I knew my girlfriend would be mad. Also, I'm really really close with my sister. She got mad whenever I hung out with my sister. \n\n5. She made me feel like shit for being talented in certain areas. I've always had really good grades and naturally pick up on things and learn quickly. However I kinda hate being smart, because all anyone ever sees me as is the smart kid. It's cool and all, but I do have a personality. Whenever I would try to open up to her, she just got mad and basically ignored me.\n\n6. She always said how awesome my life was and that her life's so hard. I have pretty severe depression, anxiety, self-harm habits, stuff like that. It's hard for me to cope sometimes. So does she. However since I have good grades that somehow made her think that my life's perfect. That her anxiety is \"worse than mine\". I can't explain it but it really hurt me. \n\n7. She was always looking down on me. Everything I said was weird or wrong in her opinion. If I messed up then she always got so mad. She constantly made me feel awful about myself and everything I did. She'd downplay things I was excited about. In example, a concert I was going to. I was really happy and couldn't wait, but when I told her she just said \"cool.\"\n\n8. She caused me a ton of emotional strain. I won't go into detail but if you actually care you can read the post I  posted a while back.\n\nAnyway, yeah. I figured that everyone here would know more about this than I do. And if it's not abuse, then I'm sorry for coming here. I just genuinely want to know.\n\nStay strong everyone, I love you :)", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Me and S got along well he was nice and funny we had some good times but freshman year things got weird. \nOften he would bring up a band he was in but none of us had gone and seen it. He was a great singer so i didnt really think anything of it at the time but he said he had a friend from there and id really like her. \n\nSo he gave me her number and i texted her and it was fun she was great and i really wanted to meet her because we really clicked but it never worked out. She was in a different city i couldnt drive yet and it just didnt work out. I saw her instagram though so i was sure everything was fine. \n\nThen S told me about his friend bruce. He was crying one day because his friend had cancer and didnt have long to live. I was really torn up about it and i wanted to help as much as i could and i would listen to him cry and helped when i could but it was alot and it was really draining. \nThen the girl he had introduced me too got very intimite and started sending naked pictures and asked me for them. \n\nI was a stupid kid i dodnt know what i was doing so i sent them.

How i believed him. And how those photos could still be out there. And how i didnt notice a thing for 4 years before this. Most of our friends know this but i havent told anyone ablut the photos.

{"post_id": "do3gh8", "created_utc": 1572233179, "title": "Something that might help later. Editing on a full manual is in progress.", "author": "ScienceforFree", "self_text": " \n\nHello, for the purposes of this post, call me Anansi. My real name is unimportant, but because I am here today to untangle a web of lies, greed and corruption, it is fitting. What you do need to know about me is this: I'm an African American male from the midwest. Half of my life was in the city, half of my life was in the country so I've seen both sides of things. \n\nUntil recently, I was working on my masters in psychology, researching experimental therapies for PTSD treatment from pre colonial cultures. The issues I faced when trying to test my research were not religious, nor directly political, they were racial. I don't mean in the \"I'm black and they were white\" sense but, in that they wanted exclusive access to something from a minority culture for minorities and what I gave them\u2026..well what I gave them showed that we as humanity had forgotten what we once knew and it hurt them that minorities had held on to it for so long. I honestly think I made them feel dumb, which was never my intention, and because of that, they used race as a way to limit the potential of my work and the potential to help others. They wanted me to exclude my caucasian participants in the preliminary trials, even asking me to ignore the sample case they gave me as a model and which resulted in my participant pool being cut in half.\n\nBeyond this I saw a pervasive greed within the field of psychology that I could no longer stomach. A drive for profit over practicality at the cost of patient lives. The peoples' from which I gathered my work gave their knowledge freely in the hope of helping.\n\nSince then, I've switched to another field and another school in another state and another time zone  but my research and experiences need to be made public for the sake of patients everywhere. Not just because of exposing corruption, but because I found a method of treating PTSD that gives the results of 10 years of therapy in 2 and doesn't require a single prescription.\n\nThe *first* main difference between this therapy method and conventional methods is the assessment that PTSD is not a disorder, rather it acts as a natural process intended to ensure the survival of the group. It focuses on analyzing, understanding and applying the \"lessons\"  of the symptoms instead of regulating the severity  and frequency of symptoms. Symptoms serve a function in  medicine, they allow the doctor to better assess the issues with the patient. In PTSD, it better allows the therapist to understand the psychological issues within a community.\n\nIn understanding the symptoms and their causes, the therapist is able to be more effective in their role. \n\nThe *second*, is that it focuses on group therapy and paired patients with compensating symptoms. An example of what I mean would be pairing someone who is bipolar with someone who has severe depression. During their high period, the bipolar person will work to elevate the depressed patient and during the low periods of the bipolar patient, the depression patient will compensate for the low due to the bond established between the two. It should be noted that as humans are a social species, it is common in social species for pairing in order to survive hardship. It should also be noted that morbid codependency would only be a concern if the patients did not progress through the therapy past having a companion added to their life. This pairing system works much like the sponsor system in A.A. in that it is a 24 hour line to both the support person, then group and, lastly the therapist as this method intends to reestablish the bonding sequence of social species that has been interrupted by the PTSD. \n\nThe *third* major difference is where the pharmaceutical industry would take a hit. Pre Colonial people's utilized a method of medicating the patient using inhaled medicines that functioned not as a mood stabilizer, but an anti-anxiety medication that induced an emotionally neutral state. Essentially, they would use as necessary to reduce the anxiety of the patient to a level that would allow them to then run through the process of analyzing the symptom(s) and its relevant function. \n\nThis medicine in the midwest was commonly a kinnikinnick blend, smoked regularly. The Salix laevigata phylum acts as both an anti nausea as well as an anti anxiety medication. In any area of the world with marijuana it would be the same as this kinnikinnick blend in this affect. Arctostaphylos uva-ursi leaves were used to allow the person to actually control the flashback as it induces a slight hallucinatory state that is controllable with education as well as easily regulated inhalation of the medication.\n\nYou can legally grow Salix laevigata and Arctostaphylos uva-ursi anywhere without severe invasive species laws. Both are smoked, though as in the case of marijuana, it may one day be vaporizer capable. It is necessary to state that trade routes existed from Canada to Louisiana and from Louisiana to most of South America. Marijuana, cocaine, dmt, peyote, mushrooms as well as teachings applicable to them were considered trade medicines as the Ruderalis strain grows in the north wild to this day and the Cartel grows it in the south, to this day.  The rest is found wild. It is also necessary to mention that with the Indian religious freedom act of the United States allowing peyote, and the Jay treaty allowing free travel across borders for indigenous people to visit relatives, the wars on drugs that are in any way associated with traditional medicine of either continent is technically illegal and a human rights violation of indigenous peoples of these regions. \n\n*I have mentioned that the symptoms of PTSD serve a purpose and, while I will explain that, I must first give some introductory information to a few core concepts of my research.* \n\nTo anyone who has ever hurt or injured an animal that was able to survive: what did they do? They run, they hide, they change their behavior, they test changing their patterns to try to get back to a normal life and adapt to survive. A prime example given the time of year is deer. A male who has been shot at will become nocturnal and move to the swamps in order to evade being hunted. They also will slowly start coming out earlier and earlier until they are confident that they will not be in danger. Deer are also being noted looking both ways before crossing roads in rural areas of Michigan and Wisconsin, a clear sign of learning to adapt over generations of exposure to motor vehicles.  \n\n**The first symptom: Run**\n\nSimply put, the feelings of anxiety, fight or flight, increased aggression when forced to stay still. The first noticeable signs of PTSD.\n\n**The second symptom: Hide**\n\nAgoraphobia, paranoia, high anxiety, mood swings, racing thoughts, fear.  The common symptoms of having PTSD. \n\n**The third symptom: Change their behavior**\n\nTesting new behaviours until they find one that allows them to feel safe. Attempts at healing from the events causing the PTSD. \n\n**The fourth symptom: Adapt**\n\nKeeping behaviours that work and getting rid of one's that are not productive to survival. Healing and moving forward from the events that caused the PTSD. \n\n***Step*** **five: The social species imperative**\n\nTeach others so that the group survives longer and with less hardship than previous generations.  Essentially passing on the information gathered in order to protect others. This step is hampered by psychology as talking about it is seen as pushing the patient. The patient was already pushed and aggression comes from confusion and frustration but, honesty comes from being too mad to think about the answer before it is given. Being there to put the patient back together is our job, not to label them fragile and pacify their desires to heal with half measures. \n\nThese symptoms are the subconscious attempting to train the individual in order to make sure that the person survives any future events of the same type. We know that there is increased activity in the hippocampus,  amygdala,  medial prefrontal cortex and subcortex. What do these things put together logically imply? The brain is forcing itself into an accelerated learning process.  Furthermore, the part of the brain causing night terrors and intrusive thoughts controls everything major in our bodies implying it can function as a secondary \"brain\" as noted in children born with anencephaly. PTSD is possible due to the rest of the brain being there, it just starts at the part necessary for life to even be remotely possible. Essentially one brain driven to survive and the other to have individual identity. When events trigger PTSD,  the second brain comes out of its \u201cfugue state\u201d and the nature of who our species is comes to light. In the days this medicine was not shunned and instead alive and free, this would be called a coming of age ceremony. \n\nThis base part of the brain doesn't necessarily have a verbal language but it does have one of symbolism and conceptual \"conversation\". Patterns of dreams, patterns within dreams, patterns of somatic symptoms in relation to certain triggers: these are all signs of this part of the brain attempting to communicate and train the individual to avoid possible future harm. An example is a series of night terrors that are of the same event, starting at different points within the event; there is obviously something about this event that the person has blocked out but the sub cortex has access to and is attempting to warn the person about. Language is complex as any linguist will tell you, and there are many ways to communicate besides the verbal sphere as any blind and deaf person can tell you. Essentially making the symbolism and concepts a hieroglyphic tailored to the patient and their life that the therapist must translate. \n\nThat is to say, dreams about crabs will only matter if the person had some affiliation with crabs or one crab in some way, even in a logo or nearby market. Mysticism is simply the easiest way to explain complex concepts to people who have no real background to understand or trust you. The fact it saved them makes it a spiritual practice for future generations and when those generations organize, a religious custom is born. Monsters do exist though mind you. But just like the trope, the real monsters were just people. \n\n***Sociopaths:*** The main Cause of PTSD outside of resource based conflict and natural disasters. They leave their victims feeling lethargic, or sometimes even dependent on them. The victim will present as sickly and withdrawn or,  aggressive and possibly even violent. These sound an awful lot like the symptoms of a Vampire, Witch, Succubus, Wendigo, Skinwalker, Nalusa Falaya, Oni, Djinn, Asanbosam and other forms of man eating giant or humanoid.. Sadly I do not have enough information on the stories of every country, making some difficult to include. However, I would appreciate it greatly if anyone wants to help contribute to the collection. The stories of these monsters are stories of sociopaths, not of the paranormal. But in the eyes of the victims family it would surely seem like a spell. \n\nMagic is just science we have yet to understand and if you can not explain a concept simply, you do not understand it well enough. This is what you get when you put religion, emotion, ego and race aside: healing. This is what happens when you put people, science and the SELF taken vow to help our patients first; instead of getting published, tenure, nobel prizes and a few more zeros in the bank account. Now when I was working on this I didn't stop when I hit roadblocks. I found willing participants and worked with people federally allowed to administer this therapy so no laws were violated. In the end I could only afford to treat two participants while working and going to school, especially in this economy. They were kind enough to include personal statements as to the effectiveness of these therapy methods.\n\n\"Given how the scientist who started this wants to keep his identity,  I am No One. I have professionally diagnosed PTSD and high functioning autism,  the PTSD partly just because i had autism in the first place. My PTSD comes from sexual abuse, physical abuse, mental abuse and ritualistic abuse. Some people have told me that it's easier to list what didn't happen and people tend to get depressed instead of seeing me as a person so that's all I am going to get into it.\n\nWhen the scientist found me I was homeless and had no one; he helped me find work, get on my feet and was there anytime I needed. There were plenty of 3 AM calls and visits in the beginning, I slept maybe 4 hours a night at most and would work as much as I could just to keep distracted. I would eat because he reminded me I needed to, I would get rides wherever I needed to help me get back to a normal life. \n\nI began using this method when I was offered nothing but pills at both the hospital and by therapists. Pills were a trigger for me and so it was just as much of an issue to take them as the issue I needed them for. I began using the lack of sleep to control my dreams(straight to rem sleep)  in order to try to understand what the night terrors meant. I had a harder time denying what happened when I was reliving it every night.  This method taught me that the dreams are like a training ground to stay sharp and keep alive. I wake up well rested now, even getting 8 hours (when my autism doesn't have something it wants to do). I wake up remembering the dreams but not fearing them or wrecked by them, just needing a moment to catch myself before I start my day, usually just an hour before I start the day. \n\nThe intrusive thoughts were there, and I still get flashbacks technically but, it's a half a second reminder or context instead of five or ten minutes and then a couple hours putting myself back together. I look forward to them as a sign to pay attention,  like a (piss off Disney,  Stan Lee is the man) spidey sense when danger is near. There is a lot we see and hear around us that we don't think is relevant but can trigger us at any moment, this therapy now has me knowing exactly what the smell trigger is warning me of, it makes the half a second flashback something no one notices but it tells me the context of a situation my subconscious is uncomfortable with.\n\nI get somatic pains still, but it's a warning I'm not taking care of myself and being stubborn.  The somatic pain and agoraphobia made me not want to move, a sign I wasn't ready to meet the world yet. After I started to work on understanding what happened to me, I feel my proper age again; I didn't realize how much I was ignoring. \n\nI have maintained seeing my therapist the whole time and now, four years later they ask me at least once a month if I still feel like our sessions are doing anything. Not that I am obstinate but that I went from not wanting to leave my bathroom to having such a normal life that I feel comfortable talking about my experience and want to share them to help others. \n\nPolitics and greed may have railroaded this but weaponized autism is real and I will pay it forward to the man who gave me my life back. They may take away his work, accuse him of lies, even try to discredit his work but it lives on in the two of us he helped and it lives on in everyone we have shared it with and helped and so on. This isn't some fringe therapy, this is real science from a real scientist who cares more about the promise to his patients than his name being known. My therapists were barely there at best and barely able to cope with what I lived through at worst. He never gave up, he never backed down, he was a real therapist and his system gave me my best friend. If not for those two, I wouldn't be alive today and I can say that with 100% certainty, I used to try hard not to be.\"\n\n\"I am a combat vet who served in the US Navy from 2013-2017.  I was told that I likely have childhood onset PTSD, that was made worse from me being in the Navy, by a licenced counselor in 2018. People lose VA benefits over this as a pre military issue so i had to pay out of pocket in order to keep what I do have. At  that time I luckily had reconnected with a childhood friend who was working on his masters in Psychology, specifically doing research on treatment of PTSD using pre colonial indigenous methods. I agreed to be a participant for his research, and I'm thankful I did. Now a days I live a normal life only occasionally touched by PTSD, and even then I have learned how to work through those moments so that it doesn't control my day. Pill free.\n\nWhile I was in the Navy, I had gone to 4 different counselors to try and figure out why I was have recurring issues with depression, anxiety, nightmares, suicidal and intrusive  thoughts and addiction. One of them kept trying to only distract me from the issues, two of them just wanted to teach me how to give myself an ego boost all of the time, and the last one thought I had a mild form of BPD. All of them asked if I wanted to be prescribed medication to \"help balance me out\", but I turned them down because I wanted to know why it was happening, not cover it up. Then I started to get help from my friend, and finally I started to feel like myself again. I had to be honest to those I was talking to and with myself about what I went through; I cried, yelled, threw things, and even laughed a bit. It took some time, but my flashbacks didn't happen as often, I didn't have as many nightmares, my mood started to balance out, and I was able to stop drinking or even have any desire to drink. Now, i know why they happen and use them to deal with life, instead of letting them run my life.\"\n\nMy research is currently being edited by a close friend and will be available as soon as it is complete, free of charge.

Breaking up and need some words of advice", "author": "cakenips", "self_text": "My bf and I got together about 9 /10 months ago. Things were magical in the beginning, same sense of humour, same sex drive, seemed to be well liked etc..\n\nFirst 2/3 months were great. But then I started noticing these things:\n\n\\- Drinks probably on average 3 - 4 times a week, almost always followed by cocaine\n\n\\- Can't be out in public without being visibly uncomfortable and fidgety about his looks\n\n\\- Literally can't do anything himself (go to the doctor, make a resume, register an e-mail, cook a meal \\[eats out almost every single meal and complains about not having any $\\])\n\n\\- Had weird freakouts because I rolled my eyes at the fact he would become preoccupied with the way I ate my food (with enthusiasm, I'll admit). At one point he rushed over across the room to smack a bottle out of my hand because I was \"making a face like a cunt\" after eating in a way he found disgusting.\n\n\\- Will ignore my calls or texts and only reach out when he wants to hang out \n\n\\- Can't keep commitments, would not reach out all day and then start with \"are you mad again? I was asleep and then my phone died\" when I would say, IM annoyed, we had plans and you didnt pick up your phone. \n\n\\- Told me he was very anxious about going to the doctor so I promised I would go for his follow up (has  alot of health issues).  Told me I shouldn't have come if i was \"just gonna be weird\" the whole time. (He basically told me the night before that me, crawling into bed naked and wanting sex wasn't cute and I needed to go out with him and let him dress me for him to be more interested. I showed up to the appointment as I said I would, just quiet and reading my book)\n\nMany, many more. \n\nThe thing that was confusing was that he would admit to me, that he did not like himself and he was not sure why. I know what this is like, and would always comfort someone that feels this way.  He said he had a chip on his shoulder and that I was better at a lot of things than he was. But these admissions were seldom, much like his 'genuine' compliments he would pay me, once in a blue moon. \n\nAnyways, I had enough when he finally fucked up our plans and had some wack ass excuse for not being considerate of my time - I have 2 jobs and am going to school (he does not work..) I am struggling with PTSD, and I am excited but nervous to be rid of him. Excited for it to be OVER finally and nervous because I tried to break up with him before and fell into a depression that had me in tears, which rolled out the welcome mat for him to smeagol his way back in.  \n\nWish me luck, friends. \n\nAny encouragement is greatly appreciated, and my support to those who have a narc in their life!! &lt;3", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I [M28] recently broke off a 2 year relationship with my ex [F30] due to the (I suspect) emotional abuse that we consistently inflicted upon each other. The 2 years we were together were simultaneously the best and worst 2 years of my life due to the amount of abuse that went on.\n\nI've read that mutually abusive relationships are rare. In typing this out, hopefully I can get a grasp on what happened and maybe get some insight from those who decide to read this. I'll start at the very beginning. I'll call her Marie.\n\n* In the first couple of months we started to get to know each other, I verbally abused her the first time we had a fight. We weren't even dating at the time but we were getting close. We were getting to know each other. She had been vulnerable and during that fight I used those vulnerabilities against her and threw them in her face. I said extremely hurtful things. Things I'm not proud of. Afterwards, she cut all contact with me. I was angry. I was hurt. But I understood. I started going to counseling and began to work on myself. I didn't let her know about any of this. I considered whatever we had to be completely over. What I was doing was for myself. I had anger (and many other emotional) issues that I needed to resolve if I wanted to be happy and prevent something like this from happening again.\n\n* Months pass. I thought about her often but I lived my life. I never took an interest in dating anyone else. I wanted to be healthy; mentally and emotionally, before ever pursuing another relationship. \n\n* We work in the same industry. One day a friend of a friend mentioned to me that Marie had an anxiety attack during an event she was working. I knew she struggled with anxiety and I knew she felt like no one understood what that was like (except me, who also struggles with it). Our bouts with anxiety was one of the things that bonded us when we first met. I felt awful about it and I mulled over what I should do if anything at all. I decided to shoot her an e-mail a few days later letting her know what I had heard what happened and expressed hopes that she was okay.\n\n* To my surprise, she responded. We reconnected. We started dating. I couldn't believe it. I was given a second chance with this wonderful girl. I told her what I was doing, that I was in therapy and for the past few months I had been making an effort in changing my worst tendencies and habits.\n\n* For a time, things were good. However, slowly and subtly, I began noticing that I felt as if I was walking on eggshells around her with the things I'd say or do. I'd have this feeling that if I did or said something \"wrong\", she would put me down for it. I would feel worthless and stupid. I recall expressing these feelings to her only to feel invalidated. I would be told I'm too naive, or that I'm too optimistic. When going to therapy, I learned to be optimistic and to be excited for the future. Excited for change and whatever life threw at me. I learned all about emotional re-framing and to try to look on the bright side of life. This was not Marie, however. She was cynical and somewhat of a pessimist. For some time, I accepted that but I couldn't accept being told that I was naive for just being who I was. I started telling her that she was too negative. That she was too much of a pessimist. I started doing what she was doing.\n\n* It got worse, but it also got better. Marie and I were inseparable but deep down I felt like what we were doing was wrong. We spent every second together. We became co-dependent. I slowly stopped going to therapy. I stopped fully working on myself. I slipped on a lot of things because I wanted to be with her all the time. I stopped seeing my friends. I stopped going out unless it was with Marie. Everything became about Marie. I remember expressing my feelings about this only to feel guilt tripped about it. I felt like I had to do everything with Marie and that I was being selfish otherwise. If I wanted time to myself, I was being selfish. I expressed why I needed time to myself and that it was good for the both of us, but again I felt selfish due to the way she responded.\n\n* I started to resent her but I wanted to let go of it. After all, she gave me a second chance. I was the luckiest guy in the world. It began to get more and more toxic. Because of what I felt like I was being forced to do, I started to abuse her in my own way. To cope, to get back at her, you name it. I would get angry. I would emotionally withdraw. I would start to invalidate her feelings whenever something bothered her. \n\n* Over a year and a half has passed and it has become so catastrophically bad. I am no longer the person I was 2 years ago. Neither is she. There has been so much push and pull on my end. I feel like I am about 80% responsible for all of the emotional abuse that has happened. I feel like I have gone so far beyond what she did to me. It has been over between us for about a month now, but she has been cutting herself and threatening suicide numerous times. She would send me pictures of her wounds and bruises due to her suicide attempts. I feel absolutely worthless and like such a loser for everything that's happened. We still talk, why I don't know. We talk only to argue. We talk only for me to apologize and for her to tell me that she hates me and that she has so much emotional trauma because of everything I put her through.\n\nI love her more than anything and I want her to be happy. I've been so miserable. I've contemplated suicide myself. She tells me she wants me to move on. She tells me she doesn't love me anymore. I tell her that I understand and that I'll stop reaching out and stop talking to her, but then she says that's my MO. My MO is to just up and leave and abandon her (which is the push and pull I was talking about earlier). I pushed and pulled a lot, emotionally, in order to manipulate and control her in the 2 years that we were together. I feel so guilty about it, so right now I don't leave her. I don't stop talking to her. We talk, and we continue to hurt each other. I continue to hurt her. I never know what to say anymore. Anything I say hurts her and drives her closer to suicide. When I don't say anything, that hurts her too.\n\nI don't expect anyone to read this. It's so long. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I feel like I have no one but her and no one but her understands what we went through.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Anyway, he is basically the first person whom I\u2019ve ever opened up to about the death of my father and how my father was as a person. This gives me immense grief\n\nMy father passed away from a rare, aggressive cancer when I was 17. I am now 22 and the grief lives with me to this day. The grief of his death, the grief of seeing him sick, the grief of my family being changed forever (it is just me and my mom now), just so many things that I know I\u2019ll never get back. I was a daddy\u2019s girl. \n\nAfter his death, I have found it hard to talk about him to anyone including close family members. I find it especially hard to talk about him to people who have never met him before because I don\u2019t want them to feel uncomfortable and they will never understand how incredible of a person he truly was anyway. I listen to them talk about their dads while I silently grieve and wish I could relate. \n\nMy nex and I started dating 2 and a half years ago, and he was the first person I have ever opened up to about my father. I\u2019d tell him anything and everything about him and what his life was like and all of the wonderful things he has done for me and my mother. I felt so comfortable talking about this with him and was always very openly grateful that my nex would listen to me about this.  This came with consequences, however. \n\nMy nex has never lost anyone in his life before and does not know what grief is. Therefore, he HATED when I would grieve. He hated when I would be sad or feel numb about my fathers death which in turn made me feel like I shouldn\u2019t grieve. He discarded me once before because I was in grief after the 3 year anniversary of my dad passing. \n\nNow that he has discarded me again, my nex seems to not give one shit about me anymore. I haven\u2019t heard from him and he and his friends are endlessly drinking, grinding on girls, and posting videos of these situations on social media for me to see. He just doesnt care. I\u2019ve come to realize that this means he no longer cares about me opening up about my dad or any of the special things I have done to keep my dad alive in my heart. All of the stories and memories mean nothing to my nex. The triumph I have made to talk about my dad means nothing to my nex. \n\nMy dad means nothing to my nex. \n\nThis fact breaks my heart more than my nex did. I cried for hours today about this. The only other person I\u2019ve opened up to about my dad is my therapist. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever have the courage to speak about him ever again now since I find it hard to trust people since my breakup. I\u2019m so distraught. Talking about my dad keeps him alive in my heart but I could only find that safe space to do it with my nex. And he doesn\u2019t even care.

My issue is that at the time of the abuse I didn't consider it abuse, let alone rape. And one of my biggest struggles is that the laws in my state don't consider it rape because I froze and he was able to do what he wanted without a fight.\n\nOf course I froze, my boyfriend was raping me. He didn't take any of my cues that I was not interested in having sex with him, and when he kept going I froze in shock. I don't know what the law expects someone to do....\n\nBut even before I knew the law I struggled with whether it was rape or just abuse or just a bad decision because I let it happen (multiple times - I froze every time).

Made me question if I was being dramatic about what he did (he also gaslighted me so I blamed myself and still do to some extent for a lot of how bad the relationship was).\n\nI ended up not filing the report because I found out worst he would get was like 3 months or a $2,000 fine or something, and it probably wouldn't have even made it to trial.

Yesterday was a weird one. My Narc is my common law husband. \n\nWe've been great for about 5 days, but now I know that it's always a matter of time. Today was the bad day.\n\nWe went for groceries, and I was told I could go wait in the car with our baby. So I did and he came out 10 minutes later. He opened the back and got super angry because there was some stuff back there. (A stroller and a box of stuff from when I cleaned the vehicle). He said I should have made room for him. I said sorry, I forgot that stuff was back there, and got out to help him. He rejected my help, and I went back into the  vehicle. After, he insisted on me coming out to have a smoke with him, and the fight began over housework and laundry. \n\"You never just get things done you just let them pile up.\" \"You walk over messes for weeks\" etc. Etc.\n\nI wasnt really having it. Having read about NA abuse lately, I tried to stay calm. I used a couple different phrases that I havent used before, like: \"That's not how I see it.\" \n\nAmazingly, our fight got worse! Lol. By the end, he was screaming at me, and I told him to stop screaming at me and that I would no longer be tolerating it. \n\nSo. We got home and he started acting COMPLETELY NORMAL. He does this often but not usually this quickly. He bantered with me as we put groceries away, he suggested a date night next week. He put some veggies on the counter and said \"I bought these. I'm trying to do things for my health. My mental health, too.\"\n\nWas that an apology? An admission?\n\nDuring our fight, one of the things was our laundry. We have had a couple clean and unfolded baskets sitting downstairs for the last week that we hadn't gotten around to. He maintained that he was very upset that the laundry hadn't gotten folded because I never helped him like I said I would. But my problem was that I had been spending this entire day cleaning! The entire house looked great, and I was in the middle of folding this laundry. I just had to run to the store and then I would get the rest of it done in the evening. So after our fight and dinner, I went to continue the laundry, and he was insisting that I leave it! \n\n\"Oh, dont worry about that, I'll do it tomorrow.\" \n\nAaaarrrggghhh! I said no, I was in the middle of it anyways, and I got it all folded. \n\nJust. Crazy. Making. Behaviours. How can you try and stop a person from getting done the very thing that you were upset about not getting done 5 minutes before??\n\nI dont think hes bad to his core, but I think he has serious untreated mental health issues. I truly worry that if I leave him, he will have nobody in his life to blame anymore, and will turn on himself. He will be found swinging from the rafters, and I'll be left with that burden of telling our kids and dealing with the guilt.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I haven't seen him in person or open to him verbally since the beginning of March 2019, and the last time I received a text message from him was the beginning of August 2019. \n\nAs my therapy was winding up, my therapist explored why I hadn't blocked him, and I said I shouldn't have to, and that I was still curious to see if and when he'd reach out to me. I was defensive, and she could tell that was only partly true. The problem was I realized it was only partly true, too.\n\nWe officially broke up at the end of August 2018 (which I've recounted on this Reddit forum in the past) and that's when the fog began to clear, I started to see his BEHAVIOR clearly despite everything he said, and watched him to exactly to me what he had done to the men in his past relationships. \n\nOf course, I was still holding out hope that I would be different, and that I'd somehow be the one to break through and \"fix\" him. Now, I see that I just wanted to prove to myself that I was worthy of him and that all of the invalidating messages from him and others in my life -- and the ones I ultimately tell myself day in and day out -- were not true and I had some kind of power over another person. Because if he found we worthy, then, surely I'd be worthy too. \n\nI've let that go, and I just don't care anymore. I've watched him love-bomb two people since breaking up, and I'm just tired of it. And funny enough, I've begun listening to people who are nice to me and have kind things to say to me. Nothing is over the top or dramatic, but these words and actions of kindness are sincere and simple, and that's where their potency lives. \n\nSo, the only way to exit the rollercoaster life of my narcissistic ex is to leave him behind, and blocking him made that feel real and, dare I say, a bit good. \n\nI'd say a big hangup and point of debate is will someone with any kind of narcissistic or toxic or interpersonally difficult and abusive behaviors change? People on our side say \"no,\" while some professionals say \"yes.\"\n\nI say \"maybe,\" but it's a long road, and a toxic person needs to see they are hurting people and care, and that's usually where any interest in acknowledgment and growth cease. And how much true change is there if someone changes a behavior, but it's effortful and there's constantly the weight of internal pushback to do it the old-fashioned way of being cruel, selfish, and grandiose? You're still living hostage to the whims of another. \n\nAnd really, can YOU (the collective \"you\") go back in, even with the chance of a change, with all of that very real history? Isn't that a ghost that will haunt you until the day you die? Isn't that fear of what could happen again too much to be worth it, or the resentment of the past misdeeds enough to make you toxic too, and there will always be embittered battles? \n\nI say \"yes\" to that, which is why I blocked him. \n\nYes, I loved him. Yes, I tried as best I could, and in the end, I only hurt myself. It's time to let him go.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Maybe it is because it is Halloween and it means the kids get attention, not him.\n\nQuick background. If you read any of my other posts or comment, I have explained that my entire life is in servitude to him, my kids, work and keeping house. I do all the childcare, actual income work and housework while he \"directs\" like a fucking King on a throne. I spend every single waking second around my kids. In the three years of my youngest's life, I have spent no more than 8 hours away from her. I  not allowed to even bathe without the kids around and am allowed absolutely no time alone at all. As I result, I have extreme burnout and that is exasperated by all the stress with him, walking on eggshells, etc. I sometimes get snappy because I have no outside adult interaction and am not allowed to do anything at all for myself, not even watch a tv show, have a five min coffee break or, as I said above, bathe.\n\nSo yesterday, the kids were playing up and I shouted at them. My bad, I know. I am so at the end of my rope not being able at all to have some down time that it happened. He came downstairs and my 5 year old lied to him horribly about what I said (I told them to shut up and get to a different room btw, she said something a lot different). Of course, he took her side and rewarded her for lying. When. I said she had lied he just went nuts on me, saying she doesn't lie, she is perfect, never does anything wrong (she is his GC and he lets her get away with everything. She has hit her younger sister before and my youngest got blamed by him for crying while my eldest got sympathy).\n\nFull on abuse for hours about how \"evil\" I am and he should take my kids away from me. He also threatened deportation.\n\nA few hours later he acted like nothing happened, while I am still reeling from all the horrible shit he said (including the obligatory fat, stupid, ugly remarks). I tried to explain to him that I need a break now and then, maybe just an hour a couple of times a week to watch a show or read. He said he didn't give a fuck, that if I wanted free time I should never have had kids. \n\nToday he woke up in his mood again. The kids have been awesome this morning and we have been having fun. \n\nHe starts on picking at things, whole ranges of topics that trigger me to get upset so he can start a fight. I said to him that I know what he is doing, moving from topic to topic just to kick off a \"fight\" (one sided monologue about what a piece of shit I am for being upset). He kicked me out of his room and started to threaten divorce and deportation again. \n\nI don't get why they do that. Just wake up and look to pick a fight, cycling through topics until they finally get to one that bites you. Just to feel better about themselves by making someone else feel like shit. \n\nI am so sick of it. I honestly wish he would get into a car wreck and fucking die.\n\nLeaving is not an option.

SO. EVER. It was definitely hard at first but it got easier very quickly. His first couple of hoover attempts for sure sent me into some pretty intense spells of anxiety, but I stayed the course and I know it made me so much stronger and I am certain I am never going back.\n\nHe mailed boxes of belongings I left at his place with snarky handwritten notes attached to my home, left food items at my door when he knew I wouldn\u2019t be there, sent multiple emails with a whole lot of NOTHING OF VALUE written in them, and texted but I only know this because one of his emails acknowledged that he knew he was blocked from my phone.\n\nI took the advice of someone here early on, and deleted his contact from my phone when I was on an almost obsessive back and forth blocking and unblocking phase. I deleted our 3 year long text chain (huge for me- I never delete my text chains with anyone), and deleted his contact so that it would be a lot of extra annoying steps to continue to block and unblock his number. The advice was great because I wasn\u2019t able to truly fully commit to blocking him from my phone at that time, and as the person here advised, if he did then text me or call me, the number would show up as unassigned and I could then decide to do with it. This worked like a charm. He didn\u2019t text for almost 2 weeks, and what he ended up texting was complete bull shit. He said \u201cam I becoming the new *insert other ex\u2019s name*?\u201d As if to say, is he lurking and texting while I ignore him, like I did one of my exes before him. It was almost insulting that after all we\u2019d been through, that\u2019s all he had to say. I felt perfectly fine at that point blocking him and haven\u2019t unblocked him since. I just literally don\u2019t want to hear anything he has to say because it\u2019s all going to be bullshit nobody needs to hear.\n\nHe emailed me a few times since. I wasn\u2019t ever and still am not fully able to block him from there. He did acknowledge in one of the emails that he doesn\u2019t know if I\u2019m getting them, so that\u2019s fine let him not know. I don\u2019t want him to know anything about anything I\u2019m doing, reading, writing, feeling, ANYTHING!\n\nIt is SO FREEING. All I can say is that I feel totally free. For me, it was not like how some people here say \u201cevery day the fog clears a little bit more\u201d in that some days are emotional and others I don\u2019t think of him at all, and then out of nowhere, another day will be emotional again. My process was not linear but it has absolutely been freeing to stay NC. At day 50, I rarely think about him. I feel feee! I feel like I\u2019d been in a prison of blur, tears, despair. And I actually feel like I\u2019m happy again. I\u2019m who I was before him again. I had no idea i would feel this great. I thought sure eventually I\u2019ll feel \u201cbetter\u201d, but I never thought I\u2019d feel \u201cgreat\u201d, pretty much ever again. And here I am at day 50 thanking god and this group that I got myself and my life back, and didn\u2019t give him one more minute of it. \n\nI will say I am not regretting any time I spent, or doing the whole \u201cI wish I left sooner\u201d thing. I know I wouldn\u2019t have been able to leave a moment sooner than I did, because that was when I was ready.\n\nSo keep going. You can do this. Be gentle with yourself. I don\u2019t know who needs to read this, but please trust me. It WILL get not only better, it will get AMAZING. But you have to stay NC 100%. This includes checking their social media. I deleted all my accounts but reddit and don\u2019t miss it and am never tempted to see what he\u2019s up to. I\u2019m actually afraid to. I don\u2019t want to feel anything for him, good or bad. The opposite of love isn\u2019t hate, it\u2019s indifference. And I\u2019m actually very indifferent about him. For real. I\u2019m here! I think I really made it.\n\nAnd I know you can too.

I have a list of things to post about but this one is really getting to me.\n\nMy NARC is known for being unfaithful in relationships prior to our marriage and even his continued flirting to this day, after almost a decade together. Most recently there has been a situation that left me really wondering if I'm just insecure or if I'm being played. \n\nLong story short - he takes our son to daycare everyday. Earlier this year there was an event and one of the teachers was a younger girl and started talking to me, not my husband. Girl and I swapped numbers and made plans to meet up and get nails done, so on. Never happened, whatever.\n\nSometime later, I noticed her show up as a suggestion for friend on IG. I clicked and saw that he was following her. I asked him what it was about because from what I saw him and her didn't have a reason to be friends - didn't even know they talked. He flipped out on me and said I shouldn't be stalking him. anyways - next day, she had me blocked.\n\nAnother few months later, she unblocks me and profile is open. I notice that he sends me something- it'll be something she has liked and so on. Also, he would follow a new profile, she would to. \\[IG used to show what pages you followed by most recent\\] This kept going on before I confronted him about it. He said he is allowed to do what he wants, before finally telling me that he wouldn't talk to her anymore. I was once again blocked by her, so obviously said something to her again. Weeks past before I go to pick our son up, she is there and you can just tell she is uncomfortable I am there. I confronted my husband again, he says I am making it up and that there is no reason because he never stopped talking to her because he can do what he wants.\n\nBut after all this she is still following him on IG and despite me telling him it makes it uncomfortable - He say he stopped talking to her finally and removed her. But I can't believe it because if it was innocent, why was I blocked by her? What does it matter?\n\nI am being played or just being overly insecure?

{"post_id": "dohjrz", "created_utc": 1572306027, "title": "Is this a covert narcissist?", "author": "TruthS4yer", "self_text": "Hi all. So lately I've been questioning my relationship of 5 months more and more. The good times are getting fewer and farther between... She's in a horrid mood half the time, which she says is due to stressing about her job, which is actual medical life and death shit. I'm slightly extroverted, and I think I'm probably an empath/codependent, so I have a history with personality disorder people, and try to be cautious at the expense of possible sabotage; ie. after divorcing an overt narc and getting screwed over, and later dating a BPD. I don't know if that's what's going on, but I'm not sure this site will garner unbiased opinions either.\n\nThis thing started out great. Tons of affection and telling stories and just feeling really good together. Lots of energy between us and even telepathy sometimes. She pushed for exclusivity on the third date, which seemed fast, but some therapists/people said maybe she was just serious. We held off on sex for a while, but when we did, it was explosive, we both said the best we'd ever had every time, and we'd hold each other and profess our love before and after, for hours.\n\nAround 2 months, the sexual intimacy was still strong, which I wasn't used to someone reciprocating, but her moods started getting worse and worse, and with that went affection and communication. She blamed it all on her medical job, which puts her on call on the weekends, plus she works during the week, basically 6 days a week, and  she needs both jobs to have enough for the house she bought while with her ex-fiance who ''left her with nothing''. She bitched about him and his habits ad nauseum, but I kept my stories to myself for a while.\n\nShe started hinting at a future together, and wanting me to move in eventually (with no discussion of whose house was preferred). This put pressure on me and raised my anxiety. She lives with her slob brother, a his dog, and her 3 cats, so this wasn't the most appealing thought after I just moved myself. I told her I wouldn't live with 2 people.\n\nOver time, she started being irritated by my presence despite always wanting me around. She'd want me to not touch her, but would be offended if I sat too far away also. She started wanting days to herself, where she leaves and takes her stuff without telling me her plan. This hurts me a LOT but she just keeps doing it. She blames this shit communication on being an introvert, and says she can't give me affection when she's in a bad mood. This still happens over and over, which is hurtful to me, causing me to question the relationship, which eventually made her angry enough to vent to her friend, saying I'm ''too clingy, overthinking, and hold things against her''.\n\nNow the relationship has become a game of push and pull, where she won't give me attention until I'm upset with her, then she's suddenly chipper and says everything I want to hear and dotes on me. I've tried all the things she requests, ie. sitting and waiting for her at her house on weekends when she gets called in, not getting in her bubble, trying not to think something is wrong, buying her gifts and snacks and cleaning her house... But her mood just keeps getting worse and she's less appreciative of my gestures. It's always MY fault for reacting badly to being ignored because she says I think too much! What's amazing though, is how she can instantly snap into a good mood in front of friends, and later snap back into being a cold bitch in private, then snap into being loving when she realizes I'm upset. That makes me think this is all an act and I got pissed.\n\nNow since the arguing is increasing, time apart is increasing, and my human needs are no longer being met. We hit a bad patch last weekend, where she called weeping (she almost never cries), and said she didn't want to live if I left her. It didn't sit well. I feel powerless already, because everything in the relationship is on her terms; her job, her schedule, her moods all take first priority over me. When I tried to call her shit today, she used deflection, blame shifting, minimizing, helplessness, and self victimhood; she even accused me of gaslighting and invalidating her! I used to think we had such open communication and that she was always so quick to apologize and be accountable, but now I realize she was never fully admitting anything was on her; it was always partially my fault or because of her ex.\n\nShe literally said every argument we've had is because I overthink everything. \n\nI'm the one trying to change and going to therapy, but I see no change in her. I'm not the most optimistic person, but I'm not sure I have any faith this can be fixed. Am I the crazy one?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I hate even calling it recovery because it makes me seem pathetic, but it's what happened to me. Anyway, I keep replaying this scenario that I had with him. One night after he violated boundaries and been rude, I was obviously exhausted. I told my ex that I suspected he wasn't interested because he didn't put in much effort and that maybe we should not continue dating if he wasn't genuinely interested. This was very early on and I kept seeing the signs, but of course I ignored them and believed the lies. The first lie (out of 3) that he told me was that he had clinical depression and memory loss. Hence why he couldn't \"meet my expectations\", ask me questions about myself, and remember things about me. \n\nHe brought a ketamine bottle that I never confirmed was his and he proceeded to tell me about how he was bullied. He told me the bullying story so many times, but I remember I later asked him why he was depressed/how it happened and if he could explain it me. All he said was \"I get depressed over what people think of me\". \n\nNow, I don't know if I'm being cynical but everything with him was never actually about him, it was about how everyone else was so bad to him - his mom, his boss, his ex-roommates etc.\nHe couldn't even tell me something tangible about his depression because again, it's about other people. That's why I just now realized that he might have been lying.

I was with my SO at the time for 8 months and we were very serious, we moved too fast for my comfort but I just went with it for whatever reason..

It's so crazy how when I was in the relationship, I knew the behavior wasn't okay.. but I kind of just put up with it because I cared for my boyfriend at the time, I did not want to leave my boyfriend because he's going through a lot and I was really invested in the relationship. I put up with a lot of behavior I should not have. I would never talk about it but when I started talking about it to my friends, just saying it out loud I realized how messed up the behavior was. It didn't take until he exploded on me in front of my loved ones till I realized this is absolutely not okay behavior. After leaving the relationship I see this from a different, more clearer perspective and I'm shocked I even put up with that behavior.. it's crazy how much you put up when you care about someone. I wish I never went against my intuition because my intuition was telling me so much but I just chose to ignore it. It's like you never expect any of this to happen to you, then you take a step back and you're like \"shit. it's happening to me!\" Does anyone else feel that way?\n\nI don't blame him. I'm realizing that he may likely be suffering with borderline personality disorder and his own issues ultimately. I did not realize this during the relationship but I'm a mental health professional and a lot of his behaviors raised some warning signs. Now that I'm out of the relationship and have had time to think about it from a clearer perspective it makes sense. It still sucks and although I don't get so upset about it as much as a month ago, it's still surprising to me because at one point we were so amazing together.

Divorce was finalized on March 12th. \n\nDuring the discard phase I reached out to his parents many times for help. To try and gain some sort of understanding of what what could be going on with their son. Long story short, my family hired a private investigator after the December 18th discard and quickly discovered he was having an affair with who we had suspected. I never told his family as I was discovering narcissism at this time and needed things to go without a hitch if divorce happens- which it did. After the discard, I never heard a word from his family whom I was close with. \n\nHe\u2019s a worship leader at a church and I wrote a letter to the church to expose the affair (he was cheating with a girl in the choir) and the church didn\u2019t care.

And when she did leave, she was leaving to be with someone else in another city. Then a year or so would pass, and she'd suddenly appear on my online services again (unblocking me) and then immediately start work on me again, and before I knew what was happening, we were together again.\n\nWe were together since 2010 this time, had 2 kids and bought a house and all that. She starts hanging out with a friend, things become more tense between us as I become more suspicious. She attacks me and gets furious when I bring up the fact I'm feeling VERY uneasy about this. She convinces me to let her sleep over his house and that I'm crazy for thinking this.  \nA friend of hers adds me on FB and tells me that a few months ago the hiking trip she went on was actually to meet a guy she met online that flew over from America. She showed me screenshots of the messages her friend got from her while she was seeing them, they were explicit. I confronted her about this and watched the blood drain from her face, but as quickly as it happened, she immediately fought back getting angry at me and demanding I tell her WHO told me this information. I refused and she stormed out calling me horrible things.\n\nThings were pretty tense here after learning this and things began getting worse in regards to her and her new friend.  \nShe began spending more time together and being more hostile when I was struggling to deal with it.\n\nFinally, I got on her computer and saw the messages between them of previous nights before they were together.

If it doesn\u2019t belong here please let me know or refer me to another sub where I can post.\n\nSorry in advance for the long messy post, my thoughts are really disjointed right now.\n\nI was raised in a relatively strict fundamentalist Christian household. I have a lot of issues to do with that, some that I have posted about elsewhere before (such as shame over losing virginity). It essentially created an atmosphere where, while I was told that I could ask questions about the religion and that asking questions was good, I always felt that I couldn\u2019t (I remember getting laughed at and told \u201cyou\u2019re so cute\u201d when I asked a question I was serious about at the time....) but even more I couldn\u2019t not believe the religion. I have heard how my mother talks about unbelievers, or people\u2019s kids that left the church when they grew up. \n\u201cWell, that just goes to show they never really were a true believer, otherwise they couldn\u2019t have left like that after knowing who God is.\u201d\nor\n\u201cGod will bring them back to Himself somehow, no matter what it takes\u2014even if he has to break their body to save their soul.\u201d\nor\n\u201cI have always said, that a persons relationship with God is reflected in their relationship with people\u2014whether they are distant, in denial, unbelievers, or following God.\u201d\nor\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really be a good person if you aren\u2019t a real Christian\u2014your grandmother is an excellent example, she seemed nice, especially on Sunday, until you got to know her.\u201d (My grandma was a manipulative, racist malicious gossip\u2014not, in my opinion, an actual good example)\n\nAmong many many other comments. She seems to treat Christians as an \u201cus\u201d vs \u201cthem\u201d almost, and I feel like if I tell her that I am not really a Christian anymore (I am headed toward agnostic), that I will become an outsider to her, to be treated differently. That is hard enough for me to get over\u2014I was homeschooled all my life out in the middle of no-where, only social contact was at church, and we changed every two years, so I never had consistent friendships\u2014my family was all I had. Unfortunately, my family is abusive\u2014my dad is manipulative and emotionally unavailable, and I am beginning to realize that my mother\u2019s methods of punishment were at the very least borderline abusive, if not outright so. (That is why I am posting this on this sub\u2014I am not sure how many problems with religion and religious views are from my abusive upbringing) As a result, losing the support or closeness of family members feels particularly devastating, and although I have three friends (one really close friend), they all live far away and I know I would feel incredibly alone.\n\nOn top of that, while I want to stop believing in Christianity, I am often overwhelmed by the fears that if God does in fact exist, he will make my life miserable so that I will go back to him\u2014I become afraid that something will go wrong with my new job, or my flight, or the apartment I am looking into renting, anything. I am pretty sure my family would even be praying that he would bring me back to him through whatever means necessary. I am afraid I would become an outcast, because not only is my family Christian, at least two of my three friends are. I am afraid that the end would come, I would discover I was wrong and that the Christian God is real and I would end up in hell, suffering for eternity.\n\nI guess this is really half vent, and half wondering if anyone else has gone through something similar and found something that worked for them, to help them work through it.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

All names have been changed.\n\nA year ago, my fiance and I (25M) decided to try an open relationship. We'd both see and sleep with other people, while still living together, being each other's primary relationship, and planning on getting married someday. During this time, I met Steph (24F). Steph understood that I was never going to be more than a friend-with-benefits, and I understood that she eventually wanted to find a monogamous relationship, at which point we'd stop sleeping together. It was very refreshing to be with someone who made it so simple, who was mature enough to say what she felt and needed upfront, and was understanding of my situation. Her and I had a lot in common, and got along really well. We were very compatible in bed, we played music together, we smoked, we watched movies, and we talked about everything, including the other people we were seeing. Somewhere along the way, she told me about Ryan (20sM). She seemed really interested in him, save for her concerns that A) he didn't have a job, and B) when they first met, he told her \"I had been planning on killing myself, but then I met you.\" I told her that that sounded a lot like \"If you leave me, I'll kill myself.\" We agreed that that seemed like a hell of a red flag, but I doubted myself, wondering if I was just reacting that way out of jealousy, so I offered the excuse that he may not have realized how she'd interpret that. She reassured me that she'd keep her boundaries, primarily that they would not move in together for quite some time.\n\nSteph and Ryan got more serious as my fiance and I realized that an open relationship wasn't really right for us. It seemed like a blessing; Steph and I get to transition to being friends while both of us have a partner to go home to, and at first, that's exactly how it went. Steph and I stayed really close, and didn't have any problems transitioning to a platonic relationship - it was actually kind of a relief, as we previously spent most of our time together having sex, and now we had more time to talk, and could actually make it to the end of a movie. However, during this time, I became increasingly concerned about Ryan. Steph would comment that Ryan made her change before I could come over, and mind you, this was in the dead-cold of winter in Wisconsin, so it's not like she was wearing booty shorts, we're talking changing tights for jeans. The only times I saw her was under the excuse of her buying weed from me. Our contact became increasingly strained. Whereas we had kept in touch, it now felt like a hostage situation. I'd message her on Facebook at a time when I saw she was online, or thought she'd be getting off work soon. It would show up as \"seen\" an hour or two later. In maybe another few hours, I'd get a brush-off reply, the kind you give in hopes that it fizzles the conversation. As I'd find out later, Ryan would \"act upset\" any time she talked to any guy, me especially, to the extent that she'd stop, or hide who she was talking to. He would shame her for seeing me, to the extent that we eventually stopped talking for maybe a month or two (I found out later that he unofficially moved in during this time without ever asking). I tried to be understanding - I can see why he'd be jealous - but that is not an okay way to express jealousy, and the fact that it didn't just apply to me, but all men, made it clear to me that he wasn't acting based on reason, he was just a possessive creep. She didn't reach out to me again until she was getting ready to break up with him, which is when she told me all of this.\n\nWith Ryan gone, we started talking again, but there was something bugging me. How do I know I wasn't just being jealous? I'll be the first to admit I never liked Ryan, not for a second, but did I just break up a healthy relationship because I'm actually the jealous and possessive one? That worry and doubt built up in me for quite awhile. I was still filled with doubt when I invited her to a park so we could watch my dog run around. That's when she told me that Ryan started talking with an acquaintance of hers (I forget if it was her friend, or her sister's friend, so let's just call her Jamie). Ryan and Jamie had been getting somewhat close, when Jamie received a call from Ryan (or a nurse, I'm not quite sure how this works) informing her that he had a dental procedure done, and needed someone to come pick him up. Ryan was under anesthetic, so not only did she have to come pick him up, he insisted on her bringing him to her house and babysitting him. Steph and Jamie were both disgusted with Ryan, and decided to cut ties.\n\nAll the worry and doubt I felt was gone. That was it. As much as I should have been horrified that Steph had spent so much time with someone clearly dangerous, I was just relieved to know I had good reason to be concerned. I had suspected that Ryan intentionally made himself pathetic and pitiable to get close to and control empathetic, trusting women, and here was the ultimate proof. It was the \"I had been planning on killing myself, but then I met you\" crap all over again. Ryan now had a clear MO of emotional manipulation, if not outright abuse.\n\nAs time went on, I became more and more exonerated of my worries of possessiveness. Steph started seeing other people, and when she told me about them, I was genuinely excited; they had things in common, they had interests that fascinated her, they seemed to have so much more going for them than Ryan ever did, and I was so relieved to not have to worry about her anymore. \n\nI suspect that things fell through with her other interests. She mentioned something about one not being ready to commit, having just left a long-term relationship. There were some other minor concerns, but things like \"I think we have too much in common\". Before long, her profile picture was her and Ryan again, posing with their arms around each other, and sure enough, I stopped hearing from her again (she hid her relationship status instead of changing it this time, though, which makes me suspect she was on-the-fence or embarrassed about getting back together). To be fair, I've hardly even tried to talk to her. It's extremely demoralizing to reach out to somebody knowing they won't reply, and then spend the next day watching the message get ignored, so for the most part, I stopped. One of the only times I did reach out to her, her response was to ignore the message for several hours, give me a brush-off reply about getting back to me later, then change her profile picture to a different picture of her and Ryan hugging (to be clear, not a **new** picture, as in she just uploaded it; she changed it to a different picture from the same set as her old profile picture), then sign off and never follow up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I guess what I'm looking for is:\n\n1) Is there any chance I'm wrong? Is there any reasonable chance that they end up having a healthy relationship with their current dynamic?\n\n2) How can I help? For those of you who've been in manipulative or controlling relationships, could I get some insight as to what's happening on her side when I message her, or invite her out somewhere, or if I were to bring up my concerns? It's very hard for me to understand what impact any of my actions could have.\n\n**TL;DR: What can I do to help someone out of an emotionally-manipulative relationship if we don't talk much anymore? What effect does someone the abuser doesn't like getting in touch have? Is there any chance his reaction will help her realize how controlling he is, or am I just giving him chances to create more distance and isolate her further?**", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I use the term loosely as he was a horribly abusive man who cheated on me many times, even right in front of me. \n\nI admit that I shouldn't have been doing this, but around when I realized I liked guys I started haunting around some dating sites and talking to older guys. It never went anywhere with anyone except for this man and he was aware of my age when we met up for the first time. He was well past old enough to be my father.\n\nTo be honest, there were a lot of red flags from the beginning, but I ignored them because I wanted the attention. He had no problem pressuring me into doing sexual acts from the moment we met. I went along with it. He would grab me by the arm and drag me along with him so hard it hurt. He would make rude comments about my body and how I dressed. But none of that made me leave.\n\nAs I said above he cheated on me with both men and women, but when I threatened to leave he would guilt me into staying. Saying I simply wasn't satisfying his needs and needed to try harder. I put so much effort into being \"perfect\" for him and it hurt even more every time I found out he had been with someone else.\n\nHe had only hit me a handful of times (once is more than enough, obviously), but it was always hard enough to leave horrible bruises. During sex he would often call me derogatory words that I wasn't okay with, and when I tried to call it off he would hurt me. I stopped fighting back eventually.\n\nThe time he almost killed me was shortly after I'd walked in on him sleeping with another boy. We got into a big argument about it and he got very violent. He: punched me, kicked me in the ribs so badly multiple of them broke, forced himself on me, and choked me until I blacked out. Eventually he cooled down and tried to apologize. I didn't say anything to him, waited until he left the room, then ran for my life..\n\nI can home in tears.

However, earlier on in my recovery, I found support in speaking with some close friends and past victims of his abuse in helping me shake off all the gaslighting and confusion he had created. One of the people I spoke to was a friend of mine who was also a close friend of his. Though I hesitated in confiding in him at first, he showed genuine empathy and asked me about it because I think he had a suspicion that something wasn't right (after it ended, which was abruptly he saw my behavior change into anxious/nervous/upset and I think realized something was going on). I basically told him that my ex was a narcissist and told him of the emotional abuse. \n\nHowever, I didn't really want to be the cause of their friendship ending, and I was also scared it would get back to him and it would somehow make things worse. Anyway, it's been months now and I'm doing much better, but I see that they are still friends, and not just that, but close friends. This friend I confided in posts about my ex regularly on his feed, and they seem to be as chummy as ever. It shouldn't bother me, but it does. How do you deal with friends that seem genuine but are still friends with your ex? I feel like sometimes people choose to think \"it's not that bad\" or that it's just another ex and messy breakup, not a full on psychopathic abusive relationship, but it somehow stings more to know that this person knows and still chooses to be friends with him, I'd almost rather nobody know and be friends with him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys do in this situation?

He was mutual friends with me AND my nex-husband. Through the fall out of my marriage, this male friend remained friends with me and slowly separated himself from the narc. \n\nFast forward and this guy has shown his \"true colors\". He is controlling, selfish, rigid and demeaning. This attitude towards me seemed to grow slowly like a leaking faucet. A mean comment here, a poor reaction here, a negative attitude, an unwillingness to respect my boundaries and/or *listen* to my feelings or thoughts on a particular situation. \n\nI am CERTAIN he has some narc tendencies just as I know I have not healed from my marriage to a narc &amp; I have concerns of codependency and trauma bonding. A part of me believes now that this 'friend' knew I was weak and decided to capitalize on some of my kindness or friendliness. \n\nExamples include; asking me to help pay his cellphone bill, asking for me to help pay for his gym membership, asking me to fly &amp; visit him BUT he wants me to come to the closest (also smallest) airport instead of driving an hour or two to come pick me up from a larger airport (with cheaper flights). \n\nBasically his selfish rears its' ugly head more and more lately. He has totally forgotten I am a single mother of two children (both under the age of 2-yrs old). He asks me (at times it seems demands of me) to help him...but he hasn't returned any favors, paid me back or otherwise stepped up to, for example, pay his OWN cellphone.\n\nI am struggling to just cut the cords. Block him. Change my number. Essentially ghost him! I don't 'owe' him anything. He hasn't done anything for me in over a year &amp; what he did offer was just a listening ear while I was going through a separation and divorce. Now if I even mention my ex-husband or my divorce or any type of family struggle he practically yells at me and tells me \"Why aren't you over this shit yet?! This is really beneath you!\" I resent him for that (I was married for 8-years and loved the fuck out of my husband. I poured my entire essence into that man).\n\nThis guy is sucking so much energy from me.

From my post I had a few people tell me to visit here and  it helped me a lot. \n\nRecap: I asked for a divorce a couple months ago after my ex threw a tantrum and tried to forbid my sister from visiting me at our house, yelled at me, said as many mean things as he could, physically intimidated me and told me to divorce him. That was almost exactly 5 months after our wedding day.\n\nI've been trying to gray rock my soon to be ex husband, but somehow he always manages to get something out of me. I started putting up very strict boundaries in the beginning and enforcing them strictly. If he tried to break a boundary, I doubled down and enforced a stricter one. At the time I was living at my parents and he had all the pets at our house. He would make weekend plans where he couldnt watch the pets and not tell me until a couple days before hand, which meant that I had to rearrange all my plans to watch the pets, or let him take the pets to his parents so they could watch them while he went out partying. Obviously I wanted to spend time with my pets, so I did A LOT of plan rearranging. The monday after the first weekend it happened I set boundaries and said he needed to tell me asap. Then he waited until thursday to tell me his weekend plans, so I told him I was spending the weekend at the house and he wasnt allowed back. He didnt like that, but he didnt show up unannounced (like he did the previous weekend, but that's another fun story). The boundaries worked! It got to the point where after I moved out, things were okay. He wasnt texting me or bothering me too much, only occasionally to whine about the dog and cat I took (he kept one of our dogs too, we agreed). \n\nAnyways, he has been slowly rolling back my boundaries by testing the waters. If he texts me a complaint I ignore it. If he texts me about his life I ignore it. If he texts me about the divorce I respond if it's with in the realm of reasonable for me to comment on. So he started texting me things I respond to, then moving into things I usually wouldnt, but he does so after we are already talking and I slip up and respond. It sucks but it works and he has found a way to text me almost every day. I got really upset about it on sunday after he tried to tell me when I need to do something. Obviously we are separated now, and I'm not gonna do his bidding on command. But of course, he wants to control me like he did when we were together and so he is telling me when I need to jump, but I wasnt playing ball.  I've been ignoring him flat out since yesterday. It's been 3 texts so far.\n\nIn the middle of the night last night I got a text from him. He said, casually, that he will be staying with his parents because he cant be alone and his life is so, so hard. Then I got into work, I was considering responding when my best friend texted me. Apparently he posted to fb a very long victim monologue about how hard his life is. If yall want to see it, I will transcribe it, it's a wild ride. I deleted him and his family on fb, deleted my account but I've got friends informing me if he posts something dramatic. I have no way of responding to it via fb, which is good because there are lots of things I'd like say that I know I shouldnt. \n\nBut now I'm at work, anxious and stressing over what to do. I'm considering taking the day to work from home. I have some extra PTO too. I might take it. I just dont know how to handle this. \n\nHe has been incredibly difficult to deal with. I thought that moving out had stopped him from trying to dictate how to live my life, when to do things and how exactly they should be done. I feel like after Sunday I'm right back into it. Like obviously I didnt do this task on my ex's time, so now I feel bad about myself. All the things he used to tell me are just swirling in my head \"I'm lazy, I'm a slob, im not responsible\". And then he has the nerve to air our dirty laundry on fb, whining about how hard his life is, when he treated me terribly for 3 years! He was talking about hating being alone and how he misses having someone to laugh and smile with BUT HE NEVER LAUGHED AND SMILED WITH ME! If I made a joke I was told I wasnt funny, I was weird and it was bad, I was required to laugh at his jokes though. They were supposed to always be the funniest thing. If I didnt laugh enough, he got upset. He never wanted to spend time with me, he was too busy with himself. Then if I didnt want to spend time with him he wouldnt leave me alone and he would whine to me about how horrible I am because he just \"enjoys spending time with me after all\". And this would be coming after weeks of walking on eggshells since he was always in a bad mood and a bad mood meant that all of my actions were up for judgment and if he was in a bad mood it was probably my fault and I needed to fix it.\n\nThis turned into more of a rant than I expected. I'm just at a loss for how to handle things and I'm so upset that the gets to act this way and theres no way for me to react with out losing. He has set it up so that he is the victim and anything I do is just playing into things.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

What I dont know is whether this is (1) tolerable/ not that big of a deal/ and/or likely to happen with anyone VERSUS (2) completely unacceptable and a dealbreaker.\n\nWe went to a wedding. Prior to the wedding, I reminded my spouse that I LOVE to dance (\"highlight of my life\") and based on past weddings, he may want to leave before me since he doesnt like to dance. I suggested we drive separately so we could both leave whenever we are ready. He said we should drive together bc he would have plenty of people to talk with.\n\nOf course, he wants to leave before I am ready. I explained that I rarely get the chance to dance any more so I want to stay and take advantage of it. I also said I would take an Uber home and pay for it myself.  No anger or irritation on my part.\n\nHe then proceeds to say that I will NOT take an Uber and I need to go with him (perhaps these were not his EXACT words verbatim, but this is the gist). We start arguing. I say that he's not my boss, I can pay for Uber myself, etc etc. I turn around and go back onto the dance floor. He leaves the wedding while I an out there dancing.\n\nLater, he texts and offers to come pick me up, which I agree to since the wedding was shutting down. On the way home, he is irate and driving like a crazy person.\n\nThe next day I try to bring up the argument and discuss what happened. He refuses to discuss, says he doesnt want to argue, and says he acted that way bc I would have given him a guilt trip about leaving. I try to bring it up again a day later to discuss what happened, and he refuses to engage. The issue is never discussed or resolved and is simply brushed under the rug.\n\nIs this example a big deal or not a big deal?!\n\nEDIT: more details. Thank you all for the feedback! I should have been clearer that this is just one recent example after years of such confusing incidents AND after my spouse insisting that he has completely cleaned up his behavior. My therapist has said I should leave and would be happier alone, but I still question if maybe it's not really that bad. Some of you mentioned that it's not appropriate to stay at a wedding and dance without your spouse. I don't know how I feel about that. But for more context, my spouse did recently move out of our house and to a different city a few months ago, so in my mind my staying at a wedding is acceptable since he chose to leave our home (he insists that I abandoned him although, prior to his move and prior to him signing a lease for an apt, I expressed my unhappiness and asked that we delay the move and enter counseling).", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He kind of found me, as he looked for criteria in a girlfriend that were important to him: back then I went to university (he never could), I also went abroad for my studies (his biggest dream so far, he never could), I was grown up in a very warm and friendly household with parents and siblings always being there for me (his parents broke up when he was a little child, his siblings always betrayed him),... this list could be endless. He basically chose me because of all these points that he was missing in his life, used to \u201cbrag\u201d with me.\n\nHe was the very first guy I trusted, my very first boyfriend. In the beginning he gave me so much attention, told me he would love me after only 1 week. He was the one who never got enough of me. And I thought that I was really in love, that he would be the one. \n\nThen, as time went by, after 2-3 months his real face started to reveal. He was annoyed by my \u201cneed for so much attention\u201d. His career wasn\u2019t going so well (still couldn\u2019t study, he changed his jobs 5 times in 4,5 years and was unemployed for 1 year), he exploited me financially (during his unemployment he didn\u2019t was his family to find out so I gave him all the money I had \u2014&amp;amp;gt; I was studying back then and I reached a point where I couldn\u2019t afford a jacket for winter anymore), he was so jealous that he wouldn\u2019t want me to even hug my friend at the Uni and later my colleagues (even at a theatre where the actor was hugging some people in the crowd, he heard that I told my friends that he would allow me\u2014&amp;amp;gt; this was the very first time I realized how sick he was), the first time he left me was, when my boss drove me home from a business appointment (the drive lasted for an hour, he couldn\u2019t accept that and broke up directly). This was the point where we ended the relationship for exactly 6 months. \n\nAfter this pause we got back together: a mutual friend of us told me that my nex missed me. And as naive as I was back then, he got what he wanted: me. Back then I really missed him and couldn\u2019t resist... \n\nThe last one year was worse than evvvver. No words can ever describe what I went through. I got gastritis, my migraine got worse and worse, I gained weight. I lost myself. I said sorry for things that I know I wasn\u2019t guilty for. I begged him and said sorry for millions of times. He argued and argued, he would tell me that I don\u2019t respect him, that I don\u2019t deserve him as a man. As time went by, I felt less and less for him. \n\nI mean: what was I even looking for? Could I really think that we might have a good future? He promised me all the 4.5 years that we would get engaged and settle down, get children. He knew that I \u201cloved\u201d him and really wanted to have a future and family with him. So I made everything that he wanted, I kept saying sorry, I cried for days. He always wanted to \u201ceducate me\u201d by going \u201cno contact or little contact\u201d after we argued - and i mean the last year we almost only argued. \n\n3 months ago we reached a point where the last month only consisted of arguments. He would want me to almost \u201cgo onto my knees\u201d, cry my soul out for him and say sorry for all the things that \u201cI did to him\u201d (he always reminded me of my \u201cmistakes\u201d from all the 4,5 years and wanted me to count them 1:1 and say sorry for alle the times I made these \u201cmistakes\u201d\u2014&amp;amp;gt; for example\nHugging a friend at the uni). He yelled at me, called me \u201cmonster\u201d, \u201cdumb\u201d, \u201ca child\u201d, destroyed the mirror in the car. He repeatedly talked about my \u201cmistakes\u201d and at some point I started to stop listening to him. I couldn\u2019t do it anymore, although my friends and family always warned me I never wanted to listen. The last thing i wrote him 3 months ago was: \u201cI cannot do this anymore, my body is not working, my head is falling apart, waking up every day knowing that we will argue over the same points again or knowing that you will ignore me\u201d he said :\u201dI don\u2019t know what your problem is, I live my life as usual\u201d. I had enough, said \u201cbye\u201d and blocked him, NC since then. I was stalking him on IG but for a few days I am totally doing NC.

I want to say it was a gradual change, but it felt sudden. The abuse was one thing (yelling at me, blaming me for literally everything, and being physically threatening), but the narcissistic actions were really the clincher.

It's for good reason.)\n\ntl;dr - I need to break up with my (NPD, emotionally abusive) girlfriend, but it's not as easy as just doing it.\n\nI need some advice for how to get out of a relationship that's emotionally abusive. I'm calling it emotionally abusive based on Google searches that led me to articles that describe traits of emotionally abusive relationships.\n\nI (male, 42) started dating her (43) a little more than 3 years ago. Both of our marriages failed around the same time, our families were friends (kids were friends), and I was exercising regularly with a group of friends that included her. So we grew closer and started dating when things with our spouses were over.\n\nI was married once - a 20 year marriage that ended when I found out my marriage was nothing but a house of lies. She has been married 3 times - first one was young and foolish, it ended on friendly terms after maybe 6 months; second one was physically abusive, she fled after a year or so when he nearly killed her (I know this is true because I have seen the police reports); third was 15+ years long, it ended because they weren't compatible in any way. (I know the 3rd husband, and I don't understand how they made it at all, much less 15 years.)\n\nI've had some \"gut feelings\" about things from the start that something was wrong, but I dismissed and minimized my own concerns. Things went from good friends to very serious very quickly. I've had to pump the brakes on her regarding things from telling the kids we are dating to getting married. The relationship has ups and downs, but for the most part, we get along well. She puts me under heavy pressure to find a job that pays more so we can afford to be together. She doesn't (and won't) work. I've put out my resume, but the reality of looking for what amounts to a 50% pay increase is that I'm not going to find it. That's been good for me, because it's held off some of the pressure from her regarding moving forward toward marriage.\n\nWe have been dealing with some issues with one of her sons, who is in therapy and seeing doctors for a threatened suicide attempt earlier this year. It wasn't until I was in with the doctor recently that his description of a narcissist sounded really familiar. She has always called her most recent ex (the kids' dad) a narcissist because he is obsessive about how he looks. The doctor's description of a narcissist (specifically lashing out when an insecurity is exposed) sounded much more like her than it did her ex husband.\n\nSo I started researching NPD online and she really does check most of the boxes. I'm not a mental health professional, but it's pretty obvious she's NPD. One of the things I read about NPD was that emotional abuse is common in relationships with NPD partners. In researching emotional abuse, I've come to realize why I had those reservations when this relationship started.\n\nI have to get out. I know this.\n\nThe problem is that it isn't as simple as just leaving. She pretty much lives with me full time. It's not a formal thing...she pays no bills here and buys no groceries here. She just kind of stays and doesn't leave. She has a home where her kids live (and an adult friend who lives in her basement, so there's an adult there all the time), but she sleeps here every night. I didn't ask her to do this; she just started doing it.  Also, I've got a bunch of my stuff in storage in her garage, including all my tools and woodworking stuff. We are together all the time...lives very intertwined...from meals to picking up kids from school to running errands. \n\nOn top of that, one of the things I've read about NPD people who are emotional abusers is that they'll lie and spread rumors to make them look like a victim when you break up with them. I went through that with my ex-wife, and it was one of the hardest things ever. My girlfriend and I are both public figures locally, and so if she started accusing me of things (and I believe she would, based on things she says about her ex-husband that I now know are not true), it'd be more than facebook drama; it'd be in the local newspapers.\n\nSo I need to know how to get out of the relationship. The most important thing is breaking up and moving on to where I can heal; I get that. But I really need it to be done in a way where she won't destroy me publicly and have me in the newspaper. And I'd really like the chance to get my stuff out of her garage (some of it is valuable, but mostly it's sentimental).\n\nI've considered ways to try to get her to break up with me, but that'd really be just me manipulating her and toying with her emotions/life, so I'd really rather not do that. It seems like a pretty unhealthy idea. I just know that if I try to sit her down and break up, it'll not go well. And I thought of taking her out of town and having someone get a moving truck and go take my stuff from her house when nobody is home, but I don't see that ending well, either.\n\nI'd really appreciate any input (especially with experience) that this community might be able to offer me that'll help me find a way out of this relationship. Many thanks in advance.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I called her out on this as I had no choice, and discarded her. She was made fully aware that the game was over, I know exactly who she is and am no longer participating. \n\nI had to know a bit more about the lies I knew she was telling, but knew she would never be honest. So I had to dig, but not very deep. \n\nThere were two guys I always knew she saw but would never admit to. So I called one guy, briefly explained that I was with her for years and that I was now breaking up with her because of her behavior. I simply asked if he saw her during our time together and he instantly said yes. \n\nAs for the other person, she lied to me and said they had only seen each other \"once,\" and that was it. I finally found him via social media and explained everything...that her and I never broke up and lived together for a long time. He quickly offered up that they saw each other for 2 years, and it only stopped because he moved away.\n\nI didn't tell him to contact her, but he did, and totally called her out on her behavior. He sent me a bunch of screenshots. He said \"Now I know why you NEVER invited me over your house for those 2 years\" and so on. She told him I was a lying psycho and made everything up. She hid us from each other and hedged her bets on us never communicating/finding out the truth.\n\nI just wanted closure and have been no contact since July, but after he contacted her that day (although she went no contact as well since I did) earlier this month after I finally found him, she denied everything and went ballistic. Sent me texts and emails threatening me personally and my property. This guy totally believed me instead of her and sent me screenshots of additional threats she told him she was going to carry out.\n\nOnce again, I did not want to publicly shame her...I just wanted the truth for my own personal closure to help me move on since I always knew she was lying. I obviously got more information than I bargained for, but I needed it. It's definitely helped me realize I did the best thing by leaving her alone for good...she was however hellbent on deceiving me (and others) forever.\n\nNow, I'm worried about Satan's wrath. I know she's freaking out because she's terrified of people seeing behind the mask/facade. Just imagine if her coworkers found out about her true promiscuous and sadistic nature (as you would imagine, she leads everyone to believe she is the opposite). You never know what these sick souls will do...and there are apparently multiple narcissistic injuries going on here.\n\nI'll never take her back, and am fine with letting no contact/karma take their course.

I care about you and always will. Even if it\u2019s from afar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to be friends and try and make this amicable. I have tried everything but this is what you wanted all along.

What\u2019s done is done. Now it\u2019s the future is what counts.\u00a0Hating me must be tiring.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re joking but I do miss you and would love to see you some day soon. I\u2019ll always love you.

The future is unclear to me. But talking will help us both be more in control of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to be well mentally and physically and to thrive. We should talk and keep communication lines open as each of us has clues to recovery for the other. We don\u2019t need to meet but we could. You can\u2019t view me as the monster you now clearly do if you see me face to face. Hating each other is not the road to recovery.

I\u2019ve certainly never been neutral about you. I love you and always will.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was thinking that I should come and see you and we can send the day together talking. I am sure you\u2019ll balk at that suggestion but my gut feel is the more we communicate the better. It may move things forward. I\u2019d like to hear about your therapy and how you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes you were my best friend. But that\u2019s over sadly. I hope one day we can be friends again. I don\u2019t regret meeting you. You were the best relationship I ever had. It didn\u2019t last but most don\u2019t. I loved you more than I have loved any man. Maybe ever will. Marrying you and having a child was wonderful. And I was on air over ten years. I\u2019m happy to speak to your therapists if that would help.\u201d\n\n\u201cOk well why I don\u2019t come down and see you and talk properly. Not by email.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe one day we can meet and talk and find a positive way forward. It will be a long journey but worth it in my view.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes I would like to come and see you and talk. I care about you believe it or not. Not I suspect. And you will say no I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell invite me down and we can find out. I\u2019ve no agenda. Happy to listen only.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate you. I never will. We had so many great times together. A deep love. I hope we can salvage even a small amount of that love from the wreckage and nurture it for the rest of our time.\u00a0I live in hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to be friends. Good friends. I do think that\u2019s possible. But my expectation has always been that it wouldn\u2019t happen for many years. once you have fallen in love with someone else. And feel like you\u2019ve met someone better for you and so able to forgive and believe that there is still value in having the person you have shared so much of your life with back in your life.  And of course being close to the mother of your child helps us both be better parents.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will always say this but I hope one day we find a different kind of relationship. Proper friends where we support one another again and are the best of friends and enjoy the wonderful things in each other that we were drawn to in the first place. I think both our lives are poorer without that connection. It could take years but I hope it comes. Its up to us both if we want it.

He also questioned if my ex was a narcissist, which felt strange. He also spoke about a rival group and how it's a scam.\n\nIt really actually wasn't helpful, one person there was helpful and validating but the leader wasn't. He felt sort of like he could have been on the cluster b spectrum. Stating how he crossed boundaries multiple times, and he was angry. Speaking about wanting to kill her and thought of all the ways but he has kids. While I sometimes in my grief think that i wish i wouldn't wake up or that a large earthquake would hit his house only. It felt really off. \n\nEventually I just stood up and said I had to go. Which was hard because i didn't want to offend anyone or their stories. I just left feeling scared and on edge. Maybe these are my triggers and it's something i need at look (my ex said id get scared of his yelling etc. because i had abusive parents, but adults yell) at but I'm choosing to trust myself for once and and remove myself form the situation.\n\nThe way home and the next day (yesterday) I spiraled and had a really bad panic attack. I felt very triggered. I found this meetup on a site. I don't know maybe they'd be helpful for other people but this specific one was not helpful for me.

I (F23) am using a throwaway account because I am nervous. My story is very long but I am hoping for some guidance and unbiased honesty. I was never officially in a relationship with the person (M30) in question here but I am wondering if he maybe fits the narc category or something similar. Right now I am feeling like I am a horrible person but a lot of things don\u2019t seem to make sense. For almost two years, I have been in love with this person. He continuously said that he was \u201cdeciding\u201d whether or not to date me, and even when he said he didn\u2019t want to, we would still hook up and I told him that I wasn\u2019t comfortable doing it if he was with other people at all and he said he wasn\u2019t. He knew 100% how I felt about him, and says that the only reason he stuck around was because I pressured him to. He would disappear for weeks at a time with no explanation, get angry over small things, insult me often and gaslight often as well (he denies doing all these). There is so much to this story but I am trying to keep it short. Fast forward about a year and a half in, I find out that his \u201cbest friend\u201d (F25) of seven years was actually just in my same position for all this time: false hope, sex, hot and cold, fighting... but worse. She also met his family, went on vacations with him, etc. At this time, I also found out that there was a third girl (F20) in the same position, but closer to a \u201cgirlfriend\u201d than I was. She and I both began things with him at the same time. I developed a close, secret friendship with the 25 year old girl because we had the same experiences. We also informed the third girl of what was going on. Eventually, the third girl told him that she knew and it all blew up. When he found out about my secret friendship with the 25 year old, he began to act very bad and scary in my opinion. He would harass me over text calling me a bad person, a c\\*\\*\\*, anything you can think of. This went on for a long time and included him accusing me of assaulting him sexually which did not happen. Eventually, I got tired of it and blocked him. He made a playlist on spotify as a way to contact me. We talked and he asked me to unblock him since he is alone in life besides me. I unblocked and promised that I\u2019d stop talking to the 25 year old so that he and I could make ammends. It somewhat worked for a few weeks but he still seemed to be gaslighting me... Somehow he found out I spoke to and saw the girl against his wishes and now he is back to calling me a horrible person. I feel like the girl and I experienced some sort of trauma bonding and he is trying to tell me she is horrible but she became my very close friend. I am just not sure what to do or what to believe other than I am a bad person for going against his wishes. Any advice would be great and also I can give more details. It is extremely complicated.

She is  a bartender and insisted our first date take place at her job, after she got out of work. It was TERRIBLE for me. It wasn't that the night wasn't fun. There were just some disrespectful and tacky things that occurred that made me decide I wasn't going to contact her again. Well, she ended up contacting me. I thought what the heck. I'd go out with her again, but in my mind it was just going to be a night out. I had no hope or intention of making any relationship out of it. Heck, my boss was her ex's mother. She warned me about her. Even said she had a video of her beating her son with a vacuum. No way was I going to get involved.\n\nNext thing I know, we became a thing.\n\nOver the last year and a half, we went from soul mates to adversaries-in-love. I started to get tired of the weird fights she started. So, I started to search online for answers. In my quest for relationship advice, I looked up narcissist several months ago. At that time, the \"symptoms\" didn't really describe her. But, one day recently, I googled female narcissist. Boy, was I shocked.\n\nHere are some of the things I believe makes her a femal narcissist....\n\nShe used to change her Facebook profile pictur daily. In doing so, she would get 100+ likes, mostly from single men.\n\nShe has one real female friend. Yet, she's ALWAYS on her phone messaging \"her friends\". Even when her one friend went to jail for 2 weeks, her messaging continued. Constantly. She assured me she wasnt talking to other guys. I never believed her. In fact, a woman messaged me to say she was texting her man. \n\nShe's obsessed with her appearance. This involves hair (about an hour per day),  nails, clothes, and tanning. Sometimes when we wake up, I suggest going out for breakfast. But, can you just maybe quickly get ready, maybe throw on a hat? Absolutely not. So, it's a 2 hour wait, at minimum, before we can go anywhere.\n\nWhen we argue, she turns things around on me. When I back her into a corner with evidence, things get confusing. The subject matter changes. Or, she makes things up. A couple times, things got sexual.\n\nI'm not saying I'm perfect. But, I like to think I'm a good person and good mate. When I say that I'm RARELY to blame for our fights, I'm being honest with you as well as myself. Yet, she has only apologized two or three times out of our MANY fights. Never her fault, and typically, she will tell me that.\n\nAfter our fights, she tells her family and all of her bar customers a completely different version of what happened. Completely!\n\nWhen our fights turn serious and I tell her I'm done with her, she reminds me that she has men interested in her and new ones message her daily. \n\nShe's never, ever, initiated sex. Yet, she needs it almost daily.\n\nShe tells me my family says I'm crazy. They don't know how (she) puts up with me. My family wouldn't do that. Absolutely not. Yet, I wondered anyways. They denied it.\n\nWhen we broke up a year ago, two days later, she posted several pics of her and another guy. \n\nWhy would I put up with this? I can't answer that. She's very attractive and most times, things are really good. We both have kids and live together, so it's not real easy to just walk away. \n\nHowever, after our most recent fight, I stewed for a few days and thought about things and told her that I lost my loving feeling, tired of the fighting and that my son and I are moving out in 2 weeks.\n\nThe reason why I posted this is to get opinions on the narcissist diagnosis and maybe for some support. I've threatened to go before, but it hasn't happened. I really need someone to tell me it's not me. It's not going to change, and that there's a better life out there for me with someone else.\n\nThank you for your time.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u2019m on mobile so I apologize if my formatting is weird.\n\nI (19F) just recently broke up with my boyfriend (25M) of just 6 months. He was my first boyfriend, and my first love. Essentially, the breakup itself occurred because I posted something lighthearted on Snapchat about a creepy coworker hitting on me. After seeing it, he told me he was upset with me for posting it because it made him \u201clook bad, feel bad\u201d, and \u201cinvites the same behavior from others\u201d. I called him out for being insecure (an issue that was wildly recurrent in our relationship, but I always doubted myself and was quiet when I felt it was an issue so as not to start an argument or feel like a bad girlfriend). He was instantly defensive and minutes later texted me to tell me \u201cI\u2019m ending this relationship\u201d. He told me he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see me the same after the way I spoke to him\u201d and then told me to \u201cgo away\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve been taking a hell of a lot of time to reflect, and am confused as to if he\u2019s a narcissist or not. MANY things in our relationship point to this, but I doubt myself so much that it\u2019s genuinely hard to tell. Here are some key signs I\u2019ve noticed pre- and post-breakup:\n\n   - On our first date, I had the strangest gut feeling something was off about him, because he was SO charming. I even joked with him, \u201cThere must be something wrong with you, like you\u2019re a serial killer, there\u2019s no way you\u2019re this charming!\u201d ... \ud83d\ude2c Funny haha, but I really felt OFF and even was scared going to his place. \n   - Always had a weird feeling he never truly listened to me. He would let me talk (sometimes) but I never felt heard, if that makes sense? He's even fallen asleep while talking or completely blown off things I explicitly told him were important to me. Once also told me \"I'm not your therapist\" after I had a rough day and was feeling emotional and isolated.\n   - He told me \u201cI love you\u201d on our third date.\n   - He told me every single one of his exes (and there are... too many to list) was a cheater, used him, etc. \n   - Treated his mother and female cousin (only women he lives with) very poorly; from his side, always claimed his mother \"took her anxiety out on him\" and his female cousin was \"immature, stupid\" etc (she's the same age as me). He lashed out at them on multiple occasions for making comments regarding his masculinity (cursed them out because they said he was acting like a girl for \"aww\"ing at baby pics, I get this is a stupid thing to say but to curse them out was something else). \n   - He would be very sensitive about things, to which I would gently try to object and tell him he was overreacting or that he was wrong for something, and he would become more upset and tell me I was being a bad girlfriend, being too critical of him.\n   - Examples of above: He didn\u2019t get enough sleep one night and blew up on me though I had nothing to do with it, and told me I \u201clost girlfriend points\u201d when I was confused. Became incredibly offended when I told him I had a date with a guy two days after our first date even when I INSISTED I lost all interest in said guy and anyone else bc OUR first date was so stellar.\n\nI can give more examples but you get the gist. \n\nNOW... I am stuck in limbo trying to figure out whether he was truly a narc or not. I know objectively that we both had flaws in the relationship, because we\u2019re humans. BUT, were my \u201cflaws\u201d blown out of proportion by him to make me feel like the bad guy, or were they legitimate? Was he as insecure as I always assumed, or am I seeing things in a different light because I\u2019ve been hurt? \n\nAnd... I want to talk to him in another week or so for closure. People have polarized opinions on this... personally, I feel it would help me understand why he did what he did. Why he gave up so quickly, why he hurt me like this when he knew I was terrified of being a bad girlfriend and failing my first relationship and made me feel like I was NOTHING BUT that. All the time and energy and love I spent on him was reduced to me being too critical, etc. \n\nBut if he is truly a narcissist, would he even listen? Would he tell the truth? How would I approach this whatsoever? \n\nTL;DR: Is my ex truly a narc or am I seeing things biasedly because I am hurt?

Charges were never fully filed because I couldn\u2019t keep my story straight. Somehow my whole family slowly accepted that none of it was real. My biological father came in and out of my life. He was at my wedding. Walked me down the aisle. Got to do the father/daughter dance, even though we hadn\u2019t lived in the same state since I was 8.\n\nAbout a year ago, I came to the realization that the things I said were so graphic and detailed that a 7 year old child could not have made them up. I remember getting in trouble with my maternal grandmother for not telling the judge \u201cthe truth.\u201d But I did tell the truth. She was furious with me. I didn\u2019t want to lie. I recently concluded that this was probably the story of my abusive and manipulative maternal grandmother and mother. \n\nA year ago, I uncovered paperwork that belonged to my maternal grandmother after we packed up my childhood home. 6 months ago I reviewed this paperwork again and found ER records from when I was 3. My biological mother - manipulator, drug abuser, alcoholic, neglectful, liar - presented me and claimed I had been sexually assaulted by my father. I went back to the ER when I was 6. I showed signs of severe anxiety. Night terrors, diarrhea, anorexia, constipation, panic at the idea of visitation with my father. I realized, with the help of a therapist who reviewed other strange red flags in my childhood, that it was a half-truth. It couldn\u2019t have been my father, but someone did sexually assault me, probably some drug dealer who was around when my mom passed out. Someone violated me as a 3 year old, and even though I have no memory of it, it affected my childhood irreversibly.\n\nOn Friday, I brought the rest of that paperwork to my current therapist. We reviewed a 2 page report that I had avoided reading carefully. It was written by a child therapist who I saw for months, once a week. After reading my child therapist\u2019s report about the audacious, coerced \u201clie\u201d I told about my father, she put the folder down and told me that what I said as a 7 year old could not have been coerced. It was too detailed. Too graphic. I read the report and read vile things that I don\u2019t remember. Things that I told my therapist 25 years ago that I remembered when I was 3. Things that gave me constant anxiety and night terrors. Things that apparently I could act out on the floor of my childhood therapist\u2019s office. Things that brought me incredible panic, shame and fear if I thought they would be repeated to my grandparents or father. I remember the shame. \n \nMy therapist reassured me that I couldn\u2019t have made it up, I couldn\u2019t have remembered and recounted in language familiar to a child that many details AND faked the physical signs of abuse. \n\nShe mentioned a line in the report which I had ignored, and written off as part of the abusive, manipulative nature of my mother and father\u2019s complicated, unhealthy relationship. He would say, \u201cI did it because I was stupid and in love with your mother and she asked me to so that people wouldn\u2019t think she was a liar.\u201d\n\nThe line in the report was \u201cAccording to H\u2014\u2014 County Children's Protective Service (HCCPS) information from [name redacted], [the father] telephoned their agency and self-reported sexually abusing [the child].\u201d\n\nLiar.\n\nI feel empty. Like a cabinet with all of my insides removed. I\u2019m in the corner collecting dust; somehow still standing. I feel like I\u2019m floating, outside of myself, with nothing around to ground me. My whole life is a lie and one very painful truth.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

(edit: the comparison surely isn't original but still I hope it has some value to some of you) \n\nWith a narc it is all about the game they play. They make the rules and as long as you're reasonably good at playing, it is fun and you get to have fun, too. \n\nAt the beginning, the rules are easy to understand and to follow. And they tell you that you are sooo good at this. And being good at something is fun. It's sooo satisfying, so you get hooked - even though to you it is not a game, it's your life. But you play nonetheless. \n\nBut if you get too good at the game, they feel threatened: you might be better than them and could even win. The nerve! To you it is not about winning. It's about love and trust and just making each other happy, so of course, you try your best.\n\nThat's when they change the rules without telling you. You still think the old rules apply and you mess up - silly you. The narc gets to throw a tantrum and tell you how bad you are at playing. That you don't try hard enough to keep up or that you don't even care about the game. And of course they feel justified in that, because you just broke one of the new rules. The one you didn't even know existed. But of course they want us to go on playing. Because playing without their favorite sentient toy is boring. So they graciously tell you how to follow the rules now. You, meanwhile, feel like this change isn't too bad. You should be able to do that. And you were so good at this until now, so maybe, you still can be good. And of course, when you go on playing, the narc again has fun and tells you so. \n\nAnd with time, the difficulty of the game gets higher and higher. There's no end to the game. It is designed to just get harder and harder. They lay out traps and they cheat to stay ahead. The only possibility to stay in this game is to completely lose yourself, to give up everything that is you, piece by piece. And while you struggle to keep up, they get bored and frustrated with their toy.\n\nSome go out to look for a \"better\" toy - that of course gets to start at level one.\n\nShould you try to quit before they are done playing, they will try everything to reel you back in and they might even lower the difficulty for a bit, so you feel like you can do this again.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I've been reading into the concept of boundaries and while I agree with most of the literature, one part of the readings has me a little confused:\n\n\n\n\n\"Emotional boundaries involve separating your feelings from another\u2019s feelings. Violations include, **taking responsibility for another\u2019s feelings, letting another\u2019s feelings dictate your own**, sacrificing your own needs to please another, blaming others for your problems, and accepting responsibility for theirs.\"\n\n\n\n\nIf I am to understand this correctly, doesn't this interpret a narcissist's inability to accept fault for destroying their target's emotional center and tendency to redistribute the blame onto their target for being \"too sensitive\" as a healthy boundary? Does this also imply having empathy for your significant other is considered a boundary violation? \n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to engaging in the relationship, I've never actually had to read into the concept of establishing boundaries since I naturally kept people away at an arm's length if I felt they were toxic (in a sense I guess you could say they were intuitive). I had no idea it was our job to establish demands for human decency! But now that I've started reading into this I've become very confused.

I do mean brutal, he's broke her neck, back, nose, arm, ankles and I'm not sure what else. He's also cut her throat and shot her, and tried to drown her.  I was also abused by my dad emotionally, sexually and physically.  My mom is still emotionally abusive, dad is no longer in my life.  After that childhood was a couple very emotionally abusive relationships.\n\nHere is my problem,  I have a very wonderful partner in my life now, we've been together for almost 5 years.  We moved in together about a year and half ago and now all these problems are popping up.  I'm always needing reassurance that I'm loved.  I'm always thinking there are alterior motives to almost everything he does.  The biggest thing I do is I have all the negative feelings about myself.   I'm a horrible person.  I do everything wrong, I can't do anything right.  I don't deserve someone as great as him.  Everything is my fault.  I'm a piece of shit.  I've tried so hard not to be this way.  I even tell myself that I deserve to be happy and that's all great until it's not.  My thought process seems to be way off.  It's causing so many problems in my relationship, I'm worried I'm messing every thing up and by constantly worrying about it, I do come continually cause problems for myself.\n\nExample:. Last night I was upset because we had a very small disagreement so I shut down (like I always do). He thought I just needed some time to cool off.  I twisted it to where he just didn't want to be around me.  We never discussed anything further.  We went to bed, I just got more and more worked up thinking things like, he doesn't care, he doesn't want to be around me.  A while back we made an agreement that when I'm having these thoughts I just ask him.  So I began to ask a couple of my 'thought' questions. \"are you irritated with me?\". \"did I do anything today that has upset you?\"  Both questions he stated no he wasn't irritated with me but he did feel like our disagreement from earlier wasn't resolved.  I then asked him if he wanted me in the room.  His response was he didn't have a preference.  If I wanted to be in the room, he wanted me there if I didn't want to be in the room then that was ok too.  I took that as, he didn't care whether I was there or not.  I cried myself to sleep\n\nI got up this morning still feeling like shit but thought, I'll get this morning off to a good start and initiated sexy time.  Afterwards, I got up, started morning routine and immediately got upset and started crying, by myself, and thinking he doesn't care if I'm around or not.  I wasn't expecting him to walk around the corner because typically he would stay in bed for another hour or so.  Regardless he saw me and I immediately turned away from him and tried to play it off like it was nothing.  He wouldn't let it go and we ended up having a 2 hour long conversation about it.  And then he brought up how confusing it is for him to have sexy time with me only to walk out and see me sobbing over the kitchen sink and that's not normal behavior.\n\nWhat is wrong with me?  Why can't I just be normal?  Why are my thought processes so different that everyone else?  Why do I sabotage the best relationship I've ever had?  Why do I push this person away or think the worst of him when honestly he's only ever shown me love and goodness?\n\nRight now I feel like a horrible person and the entire world would be so much better without me.

Tl;dr at bottom\n\nI'm crying while typing this, so any advice and tlc is greatly appreciated \n\nMy bf (22m) and I (21f) have been together 5 years. I broke up with him in march and we got back together in may. The reason I broke up with him is because for 2 years (2017-19) I was his emotional punching bag. \n\nMy bf has gone through lots of trauma in his life, and although he didn't grow up in an abusive household, it wasn't a place that fostered emotional safety and intelligence. He never learned how to know when he needs help, and how to seek it out. \nI will admit that for a short period of time (Aug-Jan 2017-2018) I was diagnosed with depression with OCD tendencies because of intrusive thoughts about my relationship that couldn't go away. And the volume in my head was too loud to focus on anything. I went and got the help I needed and am now okay in that aspect.\n\nWhen I say I was his emotional punching bag, it was like my brain was the bag and his words were the fists.  It started off with small things: him choosing to hang with friends over me even when I asked him to stop talking to certain people interfering in our relationship and not being emotionally available. Then it slowly escalated. He would start getting angry over little things and not talk to me for hours, and he knew about my anxiety over our relationship and I literally couldn't eat until he started talking to me again because the pit in my stomach was so big. Then he started calling me out of my name (bitch, motherfucker, etc), blatantly ignoring me even if I was in his face, cussing me out and breaking up with me every time we argued. This was all magnified due to the fact that I was away at school (2.5 hrs away) and I had no friends at all. He was the only one I talked to everyday, so it really hurt. \nI will admit at this point i was yelling back and cussing back, and the only name i called him was asshole. My reaction to him breaking up with me could be viewed as extreme, i would call him repeatedly and then he would block my number until he came back and said he didnt want to be broken up anymore. I know...it was the most unhealthy cycle. And I know it may just seem like I'm holding on for the sake of time..but bear with me. \n\nI finally had enough and he broke up with me 2 days before valentine's day. At this point these toxic behaviors were happening everyday. When he said he was ready to come back I told him that you can't just treat me like that. And I didn't talk to him for 5 days. We started talking again and he promised to get better, although I shouldve seen through the bullshit sooner. Everything went right back, but worse. We could not talk without fighting and me crying. I once went 2 days without eating because I was so stressed over this. So then I really put my foot down and left. No contact, blocked. He found a way to reach out to me and he couldn't for the life of him understand why I would break up with him and be serious about it. I started talking to him again during our breakup and helping him out because he was going through an extremely rough time. Giving him money and just being there. Then one day he told me I don't do anything for him. And that was it. I stopped answering. I stopped caring. My feelings turned off. \n\nHe realized 2 weeks later after I explained to him everything he had done wrong. And he asked could we reconcile. I told him we could do a trial run but at one mistake I'm leaving. And it's like he changed into a new person overnight. I don't have any major issues except for the occasional slip up with a word but he's emotionally available, supportive, caring, and everything I needed him to be during that terrible time. \n\nI don't think he realized how much he damaged me. I believe I have PTSD because when we argue now I get vivid flashbacks of times.he used to call me out of my name or yell at me. And I want to be here and try to make it work because he truly has changed and so have circumstances around him that facilitates a more positive environment for his mental health. \n\nI'm now wondering if I'll ever be able to completely move on. This is around the time of year that everything went badly, and on top of regular depression+anxiety i have EXTREME seasonal depression. \n\nHow do i forgive him? \n\nIf you read this far I appreciate you. \n\nTL;DR: How do you forgive someone who's abused you for a long time and is changing and progressing?", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Of course we have had good days, but what are good days if I spend a lot of time crying instead of feeling valued, and respected.\n\nThe past 4 years, I have been in a relationship with him. It started out as a FWB, due to the fact that did not want to be in a serious relationship, due to the fact that he (22 at the time) has a young son, married (for papers) and I was more willing to be open to him. I met the mother and everything and talked about boundaries. That\u2019s a whole other story. Anyway, as time passed we began to develop feelings and things began to get more serious. I went through a lot of shit with this guy. We never lived together, we just dated. Maybe after two years in, I noticed the first sign of abuse. In an argument, it was the first time he called me a \u201cbitch\u201d and I was livid. I would tell me that I was not raised this way, that I do not condone abusive language. At the time, I did not know I was slowly heading in an abusive relationship.

Because I am struggling to find a career made for me, he things I am not trying my best. \u201cWhat did you go to college for, how do you not know what the fuck you want to do\u201d\n\nadded with smirks and laughs, which make me BURST, and feel crazy. He has hit me before, on a drunk night. I stayed with this guy- why? Because I probably do not feel my worth. I stand up to him, thinking shit will change that he doesn\u2019t mean it when he ends up apologizing.

Eh I'll say no.\n\nSorry for my formatting beforehand.. I am on mobile.\n\nSo to start this off... I'll say I have 3 current diagnosed medical conditions: Inatentative ADHD, a very major type of depression, and a very major type of anxiety. Idk the names of both of them. It gas taken me over 8 years to get these diagnosed since I first knew something was wrong with me. I am a 17 year old male. I very recently, sibce yesterday night, found out I had inatentative adhd. For those of you who don't know what that is, it is adhd, but with the added benefits of extreme short term memory problems, procrastination problems, distractability problems, and focusing problems. The only really curable part of this is procrastination. The other things have to be actively worked on day to day with another person, or else it cannot change. As a kid with these issues, it is so difficult to even type this as it is raining, i can hear the tapping of my fingers on my screen, I can hear a soft but loud screaching if some sort of car, cars driving by, my sister talking... You get the drift. It is hard to truly focus.\n\nMy dad doesnt understand these things of me arent able to be changed. He doesnt understand that I am not a normal kid, and constantly compares his mental problems to my own. He has ptsd, an anxiety disorder, and alcoholic problems. I cannot stress enough that our anxieties are caused by two completely different situations. Mine was because of him, and his was because of his military service. I don't wanna type too much od this, so I'll just copy and paste what i sent to him a few minutes ago by text... Sorry for spelling..\n\n\"Think back at every time you told me i forgot was my excuse i used constantly... Think about all the times i legitametly forgot and you called it an excuse and made me feel like lower than shit for it... Remember all the times i lost track of time because i got so consumed into something? Whether it have been a book, games, my phone, a call, whatever.. All my life ive had these things. My procrastination which ive had to improve over years alone. All the times i couldnt actually focus because of my sensory overload? All of these years ive had undiagnosed adhd.. All of these years ive had undiagnosed depression and undiagnosed anxiety issues too. Its taken you and mom over 8 years to finally realise im not a normal kid, and grow up all those years made me numb to what id get put through. Up until age 15 i put up with your yelling and spankings and belt beatongs and verbal abuse. Ive heard you call me sissy, call me a girl, make fun of me of things of myself i couldnt control. Ive heard you talk badly about me and literally make me feel like dogshit. Up until you slapped me when we first moved in, i put up with it. I got tired of taking the verbal abuse after that point and i statyed sticking up for myself. Bullying at school was never 100% the issue and i realise that now. I realise why even small picking on me got under my skin so.much, because i went through the same things with my own dad. That is pretty sad. My own dad being my biggest bully. I cant even remember most of the times we did anything good together, because if we did, its drowned out by the bad. I barely remember the times you took my shooting, i barely remember the times you took me anywhere.. Hell did you ever actually do anything with me that i wanted to do? It was allways something you wanted to do. Always something you wanted to do that i wanted to do simply because you liked it. But all of it gets drowned out by the bad. I remember the time you took me \"hunting\", all you did was tellnme to shut up and we just walked. When i asked why we wouldnt shoot a sleeping dear back then, all you said to tiny me was \"how would you feel if someone came to you while you slept and shot you\". Who says that to a like what, 6 year old? I remember all the times i asked if we could play chess or throw ball or something and you said maybe, but never got around to it.. I remember every single ass beating i went through.. Some of it for the most minor things. I remember my first facination with games..id watch you play them and you even let me play, but soon it got spoiled all because you cared more about your ego buddies and what they thought of you, more than your own son and that he was having fun. I remember so vividly the night you were super drunk and hit mom i believe. I was shaling so heavily, rocling back and forth like i am now, trying to ignore it. I had a cop come into my room and ask what i heard and everything. And i decided to stay home because i knew you probably didnt wanna be alone that night. I was actually worried about you. Even aftwe everything yoi put me through, i get worried about you. Al the times i helped you get up the stairs to your bed or to the couch when you were drunk. All the times i just listened to you while you were drunk cause you needed someone to talk to. I remember the first time you told me you and mom were thinking of divorce. My heart sank so heavily and i wasnt in school for a week after that night. I have so many good memories associated with mom and so few with you. I bately remember the times mom would actually spanked me as a kid. I remember all the ball games and hockey games and hershey park trips. I remember the bowling and carnivals i went to with her. I reemmber all the times we just laughed and had a good time. All the times she just sat down with me and asked if i was okay. You talk about how you fight through your problems day to day, but how come you could never fight through them enough to take me anywhere or do anything i wanted to do for once? Hell you even told mom my trip to philly was a waste of money.. Even though that trip would make me happy and have a good time. All through my first psychiatrist appointment, all you talked about was how much of a trouble child i was. The second i had you guys out if the room, i simply told him the truth. You verbally abuse me. You make me feel like shit. Like im not worth being your son. I told him this because i coulsnt say it infront of you. Its pretty bad how through allnof this, i atill cant tell you face to face this stuff becauae even typijg it im crying. How do you expect me to even say any of this face to face when i know youll i terupt me no matter what? At this point im just rating to try and get pent up emotions out. Im just trying to calmly get it out without yhrowing something or yelling at you, because i hate it when we yell and push what little relationshio we have further apart. I can go back to when i called myaelf the scapegoat of the family. Im the person everyone takes their frustrations out on. Anna does it, breezie does it, mom does it, even you do it. Evwryone takes their frustrations out through me and i cant do anything to help any of you. Anna doesnt listen to me or my advice.. Mom would probably not take me seriously or listen, breezie just gets pissed at something not her way, and you just cut me off when i try to have a meaningful conversation with you.. Im typing this to ensure i dont have a mental breakdown, and i dont think i could take being yelled at much anymore.. I just cant take being the scapegoat much anymore..\"\n\nI just don't know what to do or where to go anymore. I cant really seek cps because my mother is trying to find ways to divorce him and im almost 18 so i can move out soon. But even then im just on the verge of mental breakdowns and i cant fix it.. Oh so lovely people of reddit.. What is your kind words that may or may not actually be kind.. Haha tried some humor. Probably sucked.\n\nTl;dr. My dad is a verbally and mentally abusive prick..

She was violent, but it was mostly breaking things and she only hit me once. \nShe exposed us to things I should never have seen as a child. Most of those things were her own actions and drinking. Some of it was her letting shady people into our lives. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m a 21 year old woman with Severe Anxiety and depression since kindergarten. (The official diagnosis at kindergarten was Bipolar, but  it\u2019s changed over the years.) Sometime after I was first diagnosed (I know it\u2019s after because I was taking medication long before that.) My moms boyfriend started to sneak into my room. I didn\u2019t talk about it after we got away from him. I didn\u2019t talk about it when I heard that he died when I was thirteen. I didn\u2019t even talk about it with my therapist when I finally cut contact with my mom at eighteen. \n\nWhen I finally talked to a therapist and a psychiatrist at age twenty, and was diagnosed with PTSD. After it came to light, it was finally understood why I couldn\u2019t stand touching and I can finally feel like I\u2019m not crazy for the fact that I still fear men. Especially bigger and older men(Though I don\u2019t like touching women either, but I don\u2019t panic either.) It took a lot of work I can finally tolerate crowds. People brushing up against me used to be a big problem so crowds were a no-no. And family parties are bearable, because loud noises don\u2019t make me panic as much anymore. \n\n\nI was going to have a rough go at life, BEFORE he started touching me. But I\u2019m never going to be the person who could handle their problems, like I would have been. Now I can\u2019t work because the interaction is draining. Sometimes I can\u2019t even leave the house. \nWith all of this in mind.. Why would I consider bringing a child into this world? My medication would cause birth defects. If I quit them I would start getting suicidal and paranoid and even start getting auditory hallucinations. I feel like I should get my tubes tied, because I finally found someone that I\u2019m comfortable being intimate with. I just feel so robbed.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

She can speak to ask for things she wants, call for my mommy and daddy, her sister, etc., but while her language skills are improving - she's probably around the age of a 2 year old developmentally and can't fully express herself. So this is why I'm here...\n\nWithin the last 3 months every time my daughter sees her uncle (my boyfriend's teenage brother) she loses her mind. She screams. She cries. She has a full blown meltdown that only I or her father can bring her down from. She will also try to drag her younger sister away from him, as if she's protecting her. I've tried asking her why she's so upset, but she can't verbalize it. I've tried asking her to show me, but she just shuts down. \n\nNow, my boyfriend has confronted his brother and their mother about it - his mother acts like it's perfectly normal for kids to be afraid of things for no reason (which fine, but he isn't stranger she's seen him multiple times a week since she was 2.5) and his brother denies knowing why she'd react that way to him. \n\nA few key points about teenage BIL:\n\n1. He's been diagnosed with Asperger's. But was not diagnosed until he was like 14 because of his mother's denial.\n\n2. Children agitate his issues. He can't handle loud noises at all. He freaks out if kids try to touch him. He will go as far as to use his shirt as a glove to touch a place a child's \"germy\" hands might have touched. He doesn't even like to be in the same room as kids and will outright ignore them if given the opportunity.\n\n3. He has issues with social cues. Once when my boyfriend and I were staying at his mom's house for a weekend with the kids about a year ago, my boyfriend knocked on his door - he told my boyfriend to come in and he was in a full blown jerk session to some type of Asian porn. My boyfriend was like \"dude, wtf?\" and his brother had absolutely no reaction to it. When my boyfriend confronted their mom about it her reaction was basically \"well, teenage boys have no shame\". I think we can all agree that's fucking weird though. \n\nI'm at a loss here. Our daughter can't tell us why she's having such severe reactions to merely being in the same room as him or seeing him and my MIL is acting like we're being crazy suggesting that her son might have physically or sexually harmed our daughter.\n\nI've been talking to my daughter's doctors and had her evaluated for signs of sexual trauma, which there appears to be no physical signs of. But this isn't normal, right? Kids don't just become afraid of someone they've been around most of their life for no reason, do they?\n\nShould I call CPS? \n\nI'm at a fucking loss here.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I'm a teacher at an online high school. I know it's not that glamorous, but I worked hard to get where I am, and it's totally in my comfort zone.

I was taking on her perception of my job, basically. There was a time period towards the end of our marriage when my anxiety levels in the morning were very high, and I could never explain or identify *why.* But I understand now.\n\nThe new school year started shortly after our divorce, and I've found that I'm able to appreciate so much more about my job. Our school is small and we're very autonomous as teachers; the administrators are awesome and encouraging. We can plan field trips virtually anywhere in the US, as long as there are students willing to attend. It's the most professional and positive place I've worked. The students are amazing, and very diverse because we're an international school. They are mostly from the US, but I've gotten to know several international families and some really talented students (we have some athletes, dancers, or students that basically have a career). And my favorite part is when you meet them in person, they treat you like a celebrity, because they've known you online only, so it's kind of crazy to see me in person, I guess. There are a lot of things about it that I couldn't experience as a \"normal\" teacher.\n\nThis left me wondering, *why didn't the narcissist ever say these encouraging things to help me appreciate my job?* Especially towards the end, she would always seem to talk about how boring she thought it was, or isolating, or \"lesser than.\" It's hard to explain, but it was that ambient abuse--little jabs here and there that lowered my self-worth.\n\nI just realized tonight how much more I've been enjoying my job lately, and needed to put it in writing so that I could remember what I value about what I do.\n\nDoes anyone else have a similar experience, of a narcissist devaluing you through your job?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I stopped being intelligent, now I am a know-it-all; I stopped being loving and caring, now I am somebody sickeningly sweet and overemotional.\n\n2. He told me he would never be with somebody out of love, but out of interest. He had been flirting with me for a year and I felt devastated after that. When I finally was able to stop crying and told him he should just let go and let himself feel something, he started kissing me and we had sex. Until now I thought that I had enjoyed it, but now I feel as if I was raped. I just let him do it because I needed to feel something good after all the pain.\n\n3. He cheated on his girlfriend when he did that. I was more worried for her than for him. I told him to please make a choice before it was too late and he played with both of us. When I got too anxious because of how he couldn't decide, he basically told me he had chosen her and was going to fight to earn her trust back even if it meant losing me. \n\n4. I have almost never confessed this to anybody, but after all I had been through with him, I wanted to kill myself after hearing that. We had a long conversation about it; I couldn't calm down. He talked about how much responsibility I was putting him under, that I was putting my life in his hands and he couldn't take care of it. I understand what I did was wrong, but what I felt was real. He had been helping me to get over my disability and lack of self-worth, he had given me the love that no one ever had and then he just threw me away. I felt as if I was a failure and it wasn't worth it to keep fighting.\n\n5. He wanted us to keep being friends after that. He planned a \"date\" for us which consisted in telling each other what we didn't like of the other. He criticised a lot of little details regarding my personality and behaviour. All I could tell him is that the only thing I didn't like was that he had been a coward when deciding not to be in a relationship with me after all the flirting and even cheating on his girlfriend with me. He freaked out, regained calm and explained to me why I did not deserve his love but other people (who were obviously better than me) did. I believed him.\n\n6. I realized he was abusing me. He couldn't stop showing off how happy he was with other people since he put some distance between us. I thought I deserved that.\n\n7. The first time I got mad at him he told me he had been putting up with me out of pity. He was too weak for people with disabilities. I still have the message, I'd like to be able to read it every time I think he ever loved me. I can't get myself to do that. It was a year ago, but I haven't got over that yet. He abandoned me.\n\n8. He half-apologized. Well, he said he was sorry for having hurt me, but never for what he had done. I don't know if he ever considered that to be wrong. I gave him another chance (a situation which he manipulated so it would look as if he was giving me the second chance), but I felt that he didn't love me anymore. He was so cold now.\n\n9. We went to therapy together. The same happened in every session: I told him about something bad he had done, he used his logic to put the cause in me and I ended being the one that had to change his behaviour.\n\n10. I developed CPTSD and codependency. It wasn't all because of him; I have the same kind of abuse at home, and when there was a lack of love from both sides, I suppose it just hit me. I explained to him that I have a trauma and would need love to get over it, 'cause it was in part due to what he had done. He told me he would help, but all he did was just to put up with my loving attitude without rejecting me. I believed I was the worst just for showing him my love.\n \n11. I started treating the trauma. I thought having it was my fault. I was too sensitive, too emotional. Maybe I had caused to myself. He let me believe that.\n\n12. I spent all summer fighting the anger towards him. Everytime I got angry at him, I focused on preparing him the most special gift I could find for his birthday. I did, and when summer ended and could see him again, all he said was \"you really want me to showcase this?\". Of course he then apologized and gave me some love. I hadn't felt it in a long time, so I just ignored what he said.\n\n13. He started loving me harder. I finally felt that it was real love, that he truly cared for me and was excited to spend time with me again. Turns out he was meeting a boy, so I was no more a threat to his self-doubt. I always thought that maybe he had pushed me away because he didn't want to admit to the world that he was bisexual, but well, looks like that was never the problem. \n\n14. My whole world broke down then. I felt used, played with. I got one of the worst panic attacks I have ever dealt with and when I finally calmed down, I told him that I would no longer tolerate his mind games. He abandoned me again. Right the day where the suprise birthday party I had been organising took place. \n\n15. I swallowed all the pain during the party just so he could enjoy it. In the end, he started speaking with his friends about the two things I had said in therapy that hurt me the most: losing interest in doing anything with me and giving his love to anybody but me. He started showing off his new \"boyfriend\" and telling his friends how many things he'd love to do with them. He knew I was listening, he knew I was having a panic attack and couldn't move. When the conversation finished, all he said was: \"do you want a tissue? We have to go\".\n\n16. I tried to make him feel good that night, I told him everything would be alright in time. Our plan was to step down and have a more superficial relationship (basically, sticking to being classmates in college) until we healed and got back together. Our therapist thought it was the best thing to do; she didn't know about the abuse, I never dared to speak about it.\n\n17. After realizing that I had being abused and going to therapy alone (my therapist acknowledged the abuse), I told him I was not going to hate him for it, but of course I was going to hold him accountable. Told him I had no good memory of him; it was all tainted with interest and convenience now. He seemed to understand that I needed space, so he finally left me alone. Or that's what I thought, because everyday I see him trying to catch my attention indirectly, so I'm the one that will break down and beg again for his love. That's exactly what he did after the first time he abandoned me, so I can't avoid feeling sick everytime I'm close to him.\n\nI don't think anybody will read all of this, but I just needed to let go of the feeling that I can still fix the relationship and make him happy.

I want to repeat again that it's not an advice by any means. I said that if NC works for you, then of course you should keep going. However I was miserable, not having any closure, going through a difficult breakup, which most of us have experienced. NC was hell and the bottom line of my post is not that I broke NC, it's just that I'm happy to finally have closure. I finally can move on, even if it took a final rejection from her part to do it.

I\u2019ve been talking to what I think is a narcissist long distance every day for nearly 6 months until the end of September this year. He would constantly lay silent treatment on me if he didn\u2019t like what I had said (I was treading on egg shells) turn everything around on me, he has a very high sense of himself and many more traits. He came on very strong and we were going to be meeting  when I moved. Over the months my head had been completely messed by him. I don\u2019t know how he got such a hold over me. But when he wasn\u2019t in a mood we would talk daily. I started getting suspicious as when he was lacking in communication at certain time\u2019s. It turns out he had a girlfriend the whole time who was pregnant, this was actually a one night stand who he had got pregnant and they were together off the back off that I found out later. There was no sign of her on social media, she was completely hidden. After I confronted him he denied having a girlfriend and said he was just having a kid with her. And again tried to have me feel like I was at fault. I finally messaged the girl and he flew into a rage after that demanding to know who had told me about her. He then turned nasty and blocked me off his social media but not his phone .. my texts would still go through. I really think he\u2019s done after the exposure (which was very satisfying btw) but I just wondered if that\u2019s enough to make him stay away? I\u2019m more than convinced he\u2019s not that stupid to attempt contact again?!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My NMon primed me for this with all the classic physical and verbal abuse that I think everyone knows too well.  Due to this, I have social anxiety and this may have also contributed to my ADD.\n\n  \nTo make a long story short, I helped her get into the IT industry that I have been a part of for almost ten years.  Paying for certifications, introducing her to my contacts and mentors.  I ran her through my lecture series, spent almost an hour a day explaining the technical terms she encountered.  For more context, I was also drained financially by her not paying rent or utilities.  All of this was to fuel her wanderlust and instagram persona (of which I was essentially the photographer and source of funds).  \n\n  \nIn the last six months my body knew more than I did, panic attacks, unease and just feeling terrible.  At the end she had a new better-paying career, source of attention through the community (I had all my friends and contacts vote for her to be part of the community board).  She spent a few weeks preparing, then going to our equivalent of burning man.  I did not want to go as I have social anxiety and I am terrified of using drugs that could worsen it.  She came back told me she had \"flirted\" with a few of her campmates, then turned everything into my fault when I said that was not ok.  Suddenly my anxiety and everything was my fault.  She took an excruciating week to break up with me.  \n\n  \nAt this point I was so broken that I assumed everything was my fault.  I moved to a hotel for a week, gave her money and told her to take whatever she wanted.  After six months of therapy, learning what actually happened.  I am scared of her, I am also angry.\n\n  \nA mutual friend said that I need to find a new therapist as I wanted the best for her before but now I do not.  I think I should probably just cut them out.  I have lost so much, this breaks my heart.  It breaks my heart even more that if I go to any of the friends or community that I know it is so easy to make me look like the bad guy.  I am a 100kg+ bearded tattooed powerlifter who likes mental sparring, vs a 50kg charming person in cute dresses.  My reputation and the opinion of my mentors matter a lot to me so I feel like being absent is better than being there and possibly provoking a narcissistic injury that could lead to more issues. \n\nHas anyone had any experience with this, I can't play on the same emotional manipulation level as they do.  I honestly don't want to.  Should I just admit defeat and try to rebuild completely with nothing that is tainted.  Any advice would be much appreciated, also anyone who has an isolated mountain cabin with super-fast internet and a gym let me know if I can stay there indefinitely :-)  I think that would soothe my soul.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We're going to visit my grandmother with my mom and sister, and mom has to sign some papers or whatever, since the car's still in her name, so we're popping in on the way there. The first thing I asked is \"do I have to go in, too\", which made mom mad, and looking back is probably not a very mature thing to say, but it was just instinct, but she went on for about twenty minutes about how she can't believe I'm still like this, why am I making him out to be the villain, he's done plenty of good things for us, why do I hate him, why can't I just get over it, it's bad for me too if I keep holding on like this.\nI don't want to hold on. I don't want to make him out to be the villain, but I can't help it, because it hurts so much more to think that another human being could do this, make me feel like this. I don't want to think about him, but I have the nightmares, I have the psychologist, my heartrate picks up at the sound of a car, I don't feel safe in my own home, I get scared on bad days when I see a silver car, or a man with hair or body or voice like his. That's just part of it.\nAnd I'm almost 20, but I'm so scared he can still ruin me somehow with just a word. I'm scared he's going to mock me, or even just give me that look, and I'm not strong enough. I keep telling myself it wasn't even that bad, I'm trying so hard to undo the damage he's done, to be my own person, build my own personality, but what if it hasn't been enough? What if I'm not enough? I'm so fucking scared, and I feel ridicolous for being scared.\n\nUpdate: I feel really overdramatic but mostly relieved. We got out of the car, said like 3 words to him (ofc he called me that nickname I hate and asked if I have a husband yet, but whatever), &amp; then we got back in the car and stayed there the whole time with my sister. Even my mom didn't stay more than 10 mins, also we went for cakes afterwards. It's not like I'm in a hurry to see him again anytime soon, and idk if the nightmares or the anxiety will get worse since I'm not home yet. But..he, as a person, really has no power over me now.

I recognize red flags these days because of this man, and I hope it can teach a couple of people on this thread to recognize them as well.\n\nDon't feel sorry for me. Learn from me. \n\nIn 2005 my mother left my then-stepdad due to a drunken fight, and overnight my mother, sister and I essentially had to find a new place to live. \n\nWe had lived close to Northwestern MO, and my mother worked in a cafe close to the border, so quickly she pulled together a few hundred dollars she had saved and got us into a delapidated trailer that was just yards away from the cafe she worked at. \n\nWe were poor as hell and essentially had no furniture, and the townspeople flocked to help, but especially this one man, whom we'll call C. \n\nC was known by everyone to be very kind, handsome,  a hard worker and very good with kids. He was a regular at the cafe, and needless to say, my mother quickly started to date him. \n\nC was great at first; he loved to play with us, told great stories and was funny. He seemed to treat my mother well, so to a pair of elementary schoolers this guy was the best. My mother thought it was great that he was such a good babysitter, and within a month C had moved in for good. \n\nUnfortunately, this guy didn't appear to be the same once he was a permanent member of the household. \n\nC drank. C drank like a fish, from morning to night, and shortly after he and my mother married (only a month or two after he moved in) he quit his job. He would not have another job for the remaining seven years before the divorce. \n\nC told inappropriate jokes. C made inappropriate comments. C made inappropriate comments that were so uncomfortable and overtly sexual that even a nine-year-old would recognize it as strange. An example of this would be going into excruciating detail of sex with my mother, making us listen and sending us to our room when we didn't want to listen. When I began to develop breasts, he would stare at them hard enough to where my mother would tell me to go put on a bra. \n\nAll of this would be blamed on his drinking, and very shortly I figured out that anything C did would be excused because of his \"problem\". \nI very quickly began to feel unsafe in my own home, even though I couldn't pinpoint why. \n\nFast forward a few months: my mother began to drink heavily with encouragement from C. My mother is a small woman and passes out easily when she drinks. C took this as a free pass to start saying more inappropriate things, and \"accidentally\" touch me inappropriately. \n\nOne vivid memory involves me waiting for the bus with me. Since C had no job, he had taken it upon himself to concern himself with every minute of our lives, but in the wrong ways. He insisted on coming to the bus stop with me, every day, where he would say strange things until the bus arrived. \n\nThat day, he somehow he got on the topic of masturbation. I shouldn't have to explain why this is not something you should discuss with an elementary student, and I was uncomfortable. \nI asked him to stop talking about it. \n\nHe refused, asking me if I did indeed masturbate, over and over, until I finally mumbled, \"No.\" \n\nHe turned to stare at me, looking at me long and hard before answering with complete seriousness: \"Bullshit. I know you masturbate.\"\n\nThis is where the paranoia set in. I took this as the fact that he had been watching me and would continue to do so. Shortly after this C started to come to my room in the dead of night. \n\nWe had moved to an isolated part of town, in a hollow that was perpetually damp and dark. We had no neighbors, and in this isolation my mother and C began to really rage into full-on alcoholism and pill abuse. \n\nAt night I had begun to wear full sets of clothes to bed. I noticed that I began to wake up with various items of clothing that I had worn to bed off. If I wore shorts, they would be off, thrown to the ground. If I wore a shirt, I would wake up with it balled-up in a corner of the room. I had never taken off clothes in my sleep before, and still haven't to this day, being a sound sleeper. \n\nI figured I was just hot in the night. I wasn't. The nightly visits from C started when I made this realization. \n\nOne night I woke up very suddenly when something touched me. I've always worn glasses and it was dark, so I was disoriented and a little scared. \n\nIt took about two seconds to realize that C was standing over my bed, a hand on the bottom of my shirt. \n\nIn a loud voice I asked him what the hell he was doing. He told me I was having a nightmare. He left the room very quickly, shutting the door behind him. \n\nI told my mother. She told me I was looking for attention and that C was too drunk to know what he was doing. I started staying up until three in the morning, every night, watching for C.\n\nHe would wait until after my mother and sister were asleep to come to my room. I would watch my door for hours until it eventually cracked open slowly, and there would be the C, staring into my room through the doorway. \n\n\"Go to bed, C,\" I would say, staring hard at him. I had been keeping a knife under my pillow in case he decided to ignore what I told him, every night. \n\nHe would stand there for a few more minutes each time, and I would repeatedly tell him to go to bed. Eventually he would, saying nothing during the entire duration of our interaction. Even after he left, I would force myself to stay awake, just in case he came back, until I finally fell asleep out of exhaustion. \n\nI would keep up this routine for the next 4 years, and very shortly I became suicidal. \n\nWhen I would go to my Dad's house on the weekends, I would return to find my bed in disarray, the sheets soaked with pee and slimy liquid. I asked my mother why my bed was soaked. She told me C must have passed out in there, accidentally, of course. \n\nThey started sleeping in my bed when I was gone, which was becoming more and more frequent as I grew older. Most of my interactions with C were dodging conversations and interaction, holing myself up in my room as my parents slowly drank themselves into a stupor. \n\nI started to realize that C was getting frustrated with me, and when I wasn't looking he would usually sneak some kind of touch here and there: an uncomfortably tight hug from behind, smacking my bottom as I passed by, and even going as far to pinch me on my breasts. \nAll were \"accidents.\" I couldn't take it anymore. I told my aunt. \n\nMy aunt and cousins were supportive, but the rest of the family pointed fingers. I was looking for attention, I didn't know what I was talking about, he was the perfect stepfather and I was the meddling brat. \n\nI stopped going to my mother's house. I knew I wasn't safe and I couldn't continue to attempt to protect myself. I was tired and wary of being on guard for almost a decade.\n\nIt took my mother another year to leave him, when I wad fourteen. To this day she doesn't understand why I \"accused\" C of everything I had told my aunt. She thinks I confused drunken stupor with abuse. \n\nHe still tries to call me. He sends me friend requests. My mother wants me to talk to him. I never will. \n\nFellow Redditors, listen to your children. The fact that I told my mother, repeatedly, over the course of seven years, that I was uncomfortable and scared, she refused to believe me. I underatand that children have misconceptions, I understand that suspecting your significant other of abusing your children is almost incomprehensible, but listen to them. \n\nWatch for people that latch on to your children first. I truly believe that we three were groomed into caring for this man, and catering to him. When he caught my mother up, I was at his mercy. Luckily he never attempted anything with my sister, but I don't want any child to have felt the way I did. At 10 years old, I kept a knife under my pillow to protect myself from being raped. \n\nI didn't post this for sympathy. Recognize the signs. Watch people like hawks, for while they may be flattering you and making you feel like royalty, they may be ruining your children while you're away.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

That should have been a red flag for me but he love-bombed me so well that I didn\u2019t even realize I was going down a path to hell. \n\nAs soon as I said yes, the subtle devaluing started. First he would say things here and there to put me down that would at first, make me question if I was with the right guy but as quickly as I would start questioning things, the love-bombing would start again to where I would make up excuses for him such as he is under a lot of stress, he\u2019s having a bad day, he didn\u2019t mean it and so on.  \n\nThis back and forth went on for about a month after our engagement until he came home drunk one night at 3 am and attacked me in the kitchen, threw me up against the wall and then put his hand around my neck and started squeezing. Somehow I got away and was able to diffuse him enough to where he let me go, calmed down and then passed out.  Another red flag. \n\nThe next morning this ass tells me he doesn\u2019t remember anything. That he was drunk (that was obvious) and he was abusing Xanax. Regardless, I should have left him that day but again he weaseled his way back in with his apologies and sad puppy dog eyes and I decided to give him another chance.\n\nFast forward a few months, this POS comes home drunk again and starts manhandling me again. And again stupid me, believes his pathetic excuses and forgives him and I stay. \n\nThis crap literally went on for the next year, he would get drunk, abuse me somehow, I would kick him out and he would make his way back until I finally had the last straw and couldn\u2019t even stand to be in the same room with him.  I stopped being intimate with him (he was a horrible lover) and moreover, I stopped giving him attention. \n\nDuring our relationship, he would constantly try to make me jealous by saying how woman would say how good he looked and that he could be an Abercrombie and Fitch model (really dude?) and try to get a rise out of me. He was constantly looking in the mirror admiring himself since he lost some weight.  He would even wear a mens waist trainer to hide his belly.  He also went as far to comment on what a pretty dick he had!  Omg who says this shit??  I just wanted to barf!  And what was mostly a turn off was how he put a price tag on everything by telling people to stay away from his $68K truck when they would walk by and make sure people knew he had on a $15K watch and so on.  All of his attention seeking was making me want to be further and further from him and so I stopped looking at him and feeding him the attention he so desired.   More red flags!! \n\nEach time I would try to leave him, he would cry and tell me I was his best friend and the only one he loved blah blah blah and my heart got in the way each time but it wasn\u2019t until the last time he almost killed me during the last drunken bout that I finally left. \n\nI finally started no contact just a bit over 2 weeks ago to get this leach away from me once and for all and just found out he already has a new girlfriend or source whom I feel sorry for because she will be his next wrath.  I feel so liberated and free now and I can finally breathe and get back to a normal life. \n\nWhat I regret the most about all of this is not losing this narc but rather not listening to my gut instincts and opening my eyes to all the red flags.

TL;DR: My nex employed silence to keep me talking about vulnerable things, and I\u2019m wondering if anyone can relate.\n\nSo, a lot of narcs use stonewalling tactics. That is, they withdraw or go silent in order to avoid a conversation they don\u2019t want to have. In this scenario, they \u201cwin\u201d when you give up on having the conversation and go away. My nex used to do this from time to time.\n\nBut far more often, and much more often as the years went on, he used silence in a different way, one that was much more painful. He would use it to keep me talking. Like, he would drop out in the middle of a conversation, and just ... wait. He would wait until I started talking again. Only I wasn\u2019t really \u201ctalking\u201d by that point, I was JADE-ing: I was justifying, arguing, defending, and explaining my feelings. Over and over. For hours. \n\nI would pause so he could respond, and he would say nothing; he would just *look* at me, and wait for me to continue. So I\u2019d keep explaining myself, and I\u2019d stop again. I would ask him to respond, and sometimes he would shrug. Other times he would say, \u201cI\u2019m just listening.\u201d Or, \u201cI wanted to make sure you were done talking.\u201d If I said I was done talking, he would say nothing, just look at me thoughtfully for a minute, then pick up his laptop and start typing. Of course, this was infuriating and disrespectful; I would call him on it, he would tell me, \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything to say\u201d. \n\nIf it was a high-stakes conversation, for instance, one of the many where I tried to communicate how disrespected I felt by this behavior, I would get angrier at this point. I would keep explaining my position (because that always works with narcs, right? If I just *explain myself better* he\u2019ll understand, right?) and he would look up from his computer, as if he was listening, but he would never respond. I would get angrier and angrier, more and more hurt. \n\nEventually, I would give up. I\u2019d go into the other room and start doing something else. Inevitably, he would show up within fifteen minutes, having read something funny on the internet that he Just Had To Share. I would try to explain that I didn\u2019t feel like laughing just then, and I\u2019d try to explain why, and, well, you can guess how that ended.\n\nIt was really hard to name this behavior. I felt like I was complaining because he was listening and giving a chance for me to speak. But he wasn\u2019t listening, he was getting his jollies by putting me in pain, and watching me writhe. I would saying all these vulnerable things, and it felt like I was shouting into the abyss, only it was worse, because the abyss wore the face of the one I loved and trusted above all others. \n\nOnce, years before the end of the relationship, he mentioned that people are uncomfortable with silence, and so try to fill it by talking - sometimes more than they should. He talked about how he used that to his political advantage in high-stakes workplace politics. It took me awhile to realize he was using the same technique on me. Even then, I told myself, it\u2019s not really the same thing, right? Because I was his spouse, and he wasn\u2019t trying to get me to spill any secrets, he was trying to understand me, because he loved me and wanted our relationship to work, right? Why would he \u201clisten\u201d if he didn\u2019t want to hear what I had to say? \n\nI wasn\u2019t able to disengage from this tactic until the relationship was over, and even then I\u2019d sometimes get sucked in. It\u2019s one of the reasons I went VLC (only communicating by email, regarding the very last steps of the divorce); even though I\u2019m no longer processing my relationship with him, he\u2019s really good at getting me talking more than I would like.\n\nDid anyone else go through this? It\u2019s one of those things that sound like Not A Big Deal at the same time that it\u2019s clearly A Goddam Huge Deal. Thoughts?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm really alone and sad.\n\nI'm on NC day 4.\n\nWe've been divorced over a year, after 12 years together (my entire adult life) and only went NC briefly when there was a restraining order. I was able to easily distract myself then.\n\nRight now I want this to be the final NC. I'm done. I started reading Psychopath Free by Jackson MacKenzie and it's opened my eyes to the absolute textbook nonsense he's used to work his way back in despite emotional and physical since I was 18, cheating, lying, the divorce, the stalking, threats, assault, arrest, hacking my electronics. Ug. It makes so much sense now. I'm ready to be done. \n\nBut today is hard", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

First of all, any opinion, feedback or information is welcomed because that\u2019d help figure out this issue. \n\nI find myself unable to socialize correctly because I feel fear rejection, jealousy and resentment towards ppl. \nIn every occasion I\u2019m taking with someone I fear they would say sth that\u2019d hurt me since I\u2019m a really oversensitive and easily triggered person because of my abuse from childhood until 17 yo from my authoritarian mom. \n\nMy mind sends me pictures of ppl being assholes and violent to me (it\u2019s happened in the past and the social conditions raised ppl to be bullies), e.g: you\u2019re stupid, fucking idiot. Mf loser, etc. All these things come to me with any kind of person and it makes me believe everyone is a bad person, an asshole or it\u2019s looking to hurt me. \n\nSo I was wondering and I\u2019d like to know from your experience and knowledge.\nHow do I start looking at what the person truly is and how to know if the person is actually capable of hurting me? Are all assholes ? When is a person an asshole? When are they being good or just looking to trick me? \nI know life is a scale of grays but I find difficult finding the differences. \n\nFeel free to extend yourself, I really want to read your opinions and ideas!!", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Even though I refused to interact with him, he was still happy to pick up my exact shifts. He got Narc Supply from ruining my shifts with his presence.

She has told me, point blank, that she also believes she has narcissistic traits. Like it wasn't that big of a deal. And it didn't strike me like that big of a deal at the time, but things are building and I... I am exhausted. I am depressed. I am isolated. I am suicidal. I cannot work. It feels like we are in a constant cycle of fighting and making up, and it is not sustainable for me.\n\nI feel like my entire life is filtered through her, even though it isn't necessarily overt. I am constantly worried about how my choices will impact her feelings because of how that will then impact my life. I worry about her all of the time. She jokingly asked me the other day if I feel like her \"constant therapist\" and yes! Yes I do! And I don't think that's okay. I feel so lost, I don't know where the boundaries should be. \n\nI do not feel heard and my attempts to ask to have space held for me are going unheeded. In fact, when I bring it up I am told that I need to better define what I need/want or else it is irrelevant. I feel like there are double standards in regards to how much effort is expected of me versus how much I can expect of her. I am also starting to feel like she uses emotions as means to control me, or something... for example, she told me that for apologies to count, they must be repeated multiple times, so it would mean a lot to her if I worked on coming to her and apologizing multiple times if I've done something wrong. Like this was a huge point of contention, I was made to feel like a pretty bad person for not knowing/doing this. Really appealing to emotions. My therapist straight up said that was bullshit today, he suggested it's like asking me to grovel. I think it could also be about insecurities/seeking reassurance, but I also don't think that should be rewarded/up to me to provide. \n\nShe is incredible at arguing and runs circles around me; most of my therapy right now is focusing on assertive scripts to try and disrupt that to stay on topic and meet my goals in conversation. For example, my therapist and I picked up on the pattern where I'll say X hurt me, we'll explore it a little, but then my wife starts arguing semantics and the conversation gets completely derailed as I get defensive, hurt, and angry, and thus distracted. I need to be able to bring the conversation back and say, \"No, this is what we're talking about here.\" \n\nI think one of the things that's really been hurting lately is that she keeps admitting that she's hurt me in the past, that she wasn't fully committed, that she took me for granted, that she wasn't there for me, etc, etc, etc. And then she talks about how good of a partner she is now and how improved she is. And then she asks me to reassure her and confirm it, and I fucking do it every time, even though I'm feeling very much the opposite. Now, she has done a lot of research and has done some amount of therapy on her own, but I do not think it warrants the degree of celebration she is engaging in. And, most of all, I keep coming to her with issues and this is how she views herself? \n\nThe hardest part for me is I just don't feel like she's doing this intentionally. I feel like I really know her, and I feel like she doesn't enjoy those aspects of herself. I have actually seen change in her when it comes to things like her valuing success in career/making money/what people think of you versus cultivating meaningful relationships and friendships. At the same time, I say all these things and I think to myself, \"who are you kidding?\"\n\nI also feel so much guilt and shame because I rely pretty heavily on her financially. She also pushed really hard to pay off my student loans as fast as possible (she graduated without any debt), which was great in a sense, but now I feel incredibly indebted to her because she makes a lot more than I do. We also own a house together, her parents helped us out, etc. \n\nWe have been through hell and back together and have grown a lot. We live a pretty alternative lifestyle and have a life planned together based on what I think is a pretty strong foundation of shared values. I struggle to see myself finding that again. She has supported me through a lot. I also just keep being so scared that I'm making this all up. That my gut feeling is wrong. That I want or need too much, that my expectations are too high and that I just need to be more independent and stop complaining. I just don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Even though the relationship ended years ago, I'm still struggling with the damage she created.\n\nThis felt minor, but it was early in the relationship and I should've realized it was setting the tone for the years to come. Her roommate and I were fairly neutral towards each other at the beginning. Then my anemic girlfriend came back from a weekend with me with a bruise on her arm in the shape of my thumb. She was anemic, and liked things to be a little rough. People with anemia tend to bruise easily. In fact, she had so many random bruises that she had to assure me it was just the anemia. But when her roommate saw the bruise and asked her if I had caused it, she didn't stop to tell her that it wasn't abuse. Instead she let her roommate draw her own conclusions.\n\nWhen I came by the apartment next, I noticed the change in behaviour towards me. When I asked my Nex what had happened she told me her roommate thought I was abusing her. My Nex explained to me that she figured it was just from sex, or maybe just general drunken sloppiness (we drank like fish), but also told me point blank that she hadn't explained any of that to her roommate. Word quickly spread amongst her friends that I had been beating her and as I noticed people who seemed fine with me gradually shifting to holding malice towards me I asked why she never explained it to them. Her response: it doesn't matter what they think.\n\nSo I asked her if I was just supposed to be okay with all of her friends thinking I'm a monster. I helped her get away from her abusive parents. I helped her pay for groceries. I ran to her side when a anything was wrong. I took time off work to help her get financial aid. I used my connections to get her a job. I'm a pacifist. I haven't been in a fight since 8th grade, and that was with my brother. I told her that I felt unwelcomed in her apartment. She told me that was ridiculous. I was overreacting. When I object, she started a fight. In an instant, I was the bad guy, no questions asked. The hostile glares made me leave. When I left, she asked me why. When I told her she said I was acting like a baby.\n\nI should've realized it then. She liked the attention. She liked the fact that this gave her an out - she could behave as poorly as she wanted towards me and her friends would always tell her she was in the right because a thumb shaped bruise on an anemic body was mistaken for abuse. She could always be the victim.\n\nI wish I had realized it then. I could've saved myself five years of suffering. And maybe I would be able to trust another person well enough to let them into my life. But I didn't, and I can't. But then again, I've been surrounded by Narcs my whole life... I was raised by them. And that just makes healing all the more difficult.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}
