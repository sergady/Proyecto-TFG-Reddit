(Also posted elsewhere", "author": "Lani_Tsuki", "self_text": "I\u2019ll try to keep things somewhat simple / FYI some sensitive topics on here. Throwing a few questions in there too; any advice is appreciated.\n\nI\u2019m 21 years old, and have dealt with many hiccups involving parents and mental health\n\n____ Past things/backstory ___\n\nFrom a young age, I\u2019ve seen many things I shouldn\u2019t of; I\u2019ve watched my mother self harm, watched her smash the house and car up when she got angry, scream&amp;shout - punching walls, and of course take things out on a young child (me) who had no idea what was going on. \n\nThings were always happening, my parents would be on and off like a light switch, we moved house quite often. Neighbors didn\u2019t stay friends with my family for too long. \n\nI was a very quiet child, still \u2014 to this day. I had very little friends, was bullied in school, all that lark. Retreated to video games and art as a \u2018getaway\u2019. Teachers would always point out that I preferred to be on my own, that I didn\u2019t speak up in class, so on.\n\nIn the past, I never understood why my mother would take her anger out on me, I was always scolded for doing the smallest of things. If I accidentally dropped a glass, I would be punished for it or screamed at. (Which still effects me today; I get in a panic and expect to be scolded. I\u2019m almost 22 ffs.)\nIf I asked for something more than once, I\u2019d be punished for \u201cgoing on\u201d. I even recall getting that upset, I couldn\u2019t finish or even touch my dinner. \n\nThere was a lot of things I didn\u2019t understand. It wasn\u2019t long that I was fully educated about depression and mental health , so had to accept how it was.\n\nGrowing up, I still had to juggle all of this, teenage years didn\u2019t get any easier ; bulling at school once again, I had competitiveness with a younger brother. \n\n\u201cYour brother eats this (insert random food item here), why don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t you? Your brother can do it and he\u2019s 5.\u201d, \u201cHe got this (present) because he has been good, what\u2019s your excuse.\u201d, \u201cHe looks like gets more because your stuff is so expensive.\u201d \u2014 I would actually have logical reasoning and they wouldn\u2019t like or agree with it. \n\nI viewed my brother to be the golden child. He got whatever he asked for, if he broke something - he would have it replaced soon as. It still happens today. \n\nHe got away with a fuck tonne of thing; things that /I/ was punished for. Jealousy boiled, no surprise. But I punished myself for being \u201cselfish\u201d. I kept it to myself. I never hated him for it, I was just jealous - why did he get treated differently and I got shit all the time?\n___\n\n \n~ Key event ~ \n\nMoving on \u2014 I started college at 16; ended up meeting someone who I ended up dating. Few months into the relationship, I end up venting to him about how I felt about my past and how my parents treat me. I had seen what other families were like and it made me question; was all the shit I got fair? \n\nMy (Ex) partner said it wasn\u2019t right how I was treated. And also how my father stood by and let it all happen - my ex had labelled her to be narcissistic. (We\u2019ll get more into that in just a moment.) admittedly, I didn\u2019t know what it meant (never done well at school, hah), but had a search, seeing that other people have had to deal with similar situations. I had started to break down.\n\nI had my ups and downs over the years, feeling upset was too common, and I would never admit nor accept I was depressed. \u201cIt be like that\u201d attitude - I was positive, \u201cjust one of those days.\u201d Anyway. \nMy ex and his mother came by after my mother asked for them to, she thought I would benefit by stopping over at his (/his mum\u2019s place with him), and I did. I had college in the morning so I packed my things I needed. And left. \n\nOne /key/ thing. \n\nI left my mobile phone on my bed. \n\nThis is when I lost everything. \nMy mother managed to find out my password (android phone, using the pattern-lock, supposedly not a hard password; backward Z for \u201cZelda\u201d), breaching my privacy - read through my messages between me and him.\n\nBecause I had emptied on him about my past, and also read his opinion - AND other private messages that weren\u2019t anything to do with her. Things just blew up the next day.\n\nI realised I left my phone at home but dismissed it, I could always use the college community phone. To my surprise, I got called in by student support during my lesson; a message from my mum asking for me to pop round home, and that she wanted to give me some advice. \nMe, thinking nothing of it, asked my ex\u2019s mum to stop by after college. \n\nIt was a family gathering; my ex came in the living room with me and my mother told me to sit down - she had that tone of voice on and I knew I was being told off for /something/, but something I didn\u2019t know.\nShe held up my phone and asked me about the messages. I explained to her I wanted to vent, and I ended up admitting that I was depressed, angry, so on. I wasn\u2019t saying anything that was out of order in my eyes - just the truth, nothing but the truth. \n\nGonna cut a lot of shit out; it resulted in me being kicked out. \n\u201cIf you feel that way then you may as well not be here.\u201d I remember looking at my dad, absolutely bawling - crying my eyes out, seeing if he saw anything in my light. He didn\u2019t say a word. I saw him to be the logical one, clearly I was wrong. \n\nMy mother ushered me upstairs to go pack a bag; she gave me two black bin bags and followed me upstairs. She kept going on about how selfish I was, how disappointing I was, how dare I be upset when she has to deal with her own problems. How I was so disrespectful - making me cry more and more, to the point where she got in my face and just continued to hurl verbal abuse. \n\nI ended up hurling an arm full of clothes into a bag, my most valuable items (I knew she would sell- more to that later !) being games in there, art stuff and that was it. Basics in the looooong 5 minutes. \n\nI ended up living with my ex, his mum and his brother for about 4-5 years. During the first two I had to handle harassing messages over Facebook and had to destroy a SIM card. My mother pretended to be my younger brother (using his Facebook account) to try make me feel bad, or to make me \u201ccome home.\u201d\n\n(Messages has their own cycle of; I\u2019m sorry, please come home - (If I don\u2019t respond) - If you don\u2019t come and get your stuff I will burn it/more abuse. Why won\u2019t you come home and see your brother, he\u2019s crying for you right now. )\n\n___ ~~~~ \n\nNext part (thanks for reading this far btw) \n\nMy ex and I ended up splitting up in late 2017, I\u2019ll spare that story but couple months before that, I ended up bumping into my mother in a different town. I was surprised to see she was calm. We ended up talking for a little while, and I started to believe we both got more mature.\n\nShe found out she had Borderline Personality disorder.\nI was diagnosed with a form of ADHD in 2017. We had things to learn about, and it was a key thing to be supportive with. \n\nOnce I split with him, my mother found out and offered for me to move back in. I accepted, and I have now been there since Jan2018\n\nI\u2019ll fast forward to the now. \n\nI\u2019m almost 22. Female. Lost everything twice, have my own personal issues to deal with (B12 deficiency /possible pernicious Anemia - endless testing), my current job has given me a lot of excess shit (had been threatened at work with a gun, fucked around at work bc/other staff members, overworked and bullied by my boss.) which I\u2019ve sorted out a meeting for - there\u2019s a lot on my plate that I\u2019m trying to eat on my own. \n\nSince I\u2019ve moved back with my parents, I realised nothing changed. I believe it\u2019s making my mental health worse. \n\nMy mother smokes cannabis (illegal here), invites her friends round to smoke it; she has pushed me to use it a number of times. There\u2019s been a couple situations where it\u2019s been supplied. I do not agree with it.\n\nI initially didn\u2019t mind her using it to help her BPD, I had no issues. She told me before I moved back in; I asked for her to not smoke it when I\u2019m in the room or near my work uniform. Or around my art stuff (yellow papers no thnx) She said it was perfectly fine and wouldn\u2019t do so.\n\nHowever it got to the case where it\u2019s \u201cOh I need a joint.\u201d, \u201cif I don\u2019t have one I\u2019m gonna punch something\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t talk to me, let me have this first\u201d, there\u2019s always a need. Yet, brags about /not/ being addicted. ????! Ok. \nBut this is where I started to disagree - bringing friends around, supplying, all that. And these boundaries started to break. Very quickly. \n\nSo. It dawned on me, this family is full of false promises. And it always has been. I remember being promised many things when I was younger (getting XYZ thing, general \u201cim sorry, i won\u2019t do it again\u201d stuff, you get the idea ). They wanted to make up for lost birthdays and promised me this and that. Never happened.\nWhen me and my mother clashed one time; \u201cI won\u2019t scream or shout at you.\u201d It happened. \u201cI don\u2019t punch walls anymore.\u201d It happened.\n\n\u201cI promise I won\u2019t treat you like I did before and I\u2019ll always be there to support you.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t feel it. \n\nSince I\u2019ve been living there again, I believe I\u2019ve been seen as a bank. Because I\u2019m the only one in the house who has a job. \n\nI always get asked money from her to go towards cannabis or tobacco - i get money asked from me left right and centre because it all gets wasted (I say wasted because she shares her weed out to these \u201cfriends\u201d, and smokes it in one sitting) \nAnd the money I give them isn\u2019t used for the things they actually say they need. \n\nShe would constantly guilt trip me into giving her something of mine, money or item. \u201cI really need \u00a320, I\u2019m really sore, in a lot of pain, oooo.\u201d And melt into herself till I gave it. \nBecause their money gets spend on cannabis, it also results in my mother shoplifting. \u201cWhy should we pay for cat litter\u201d, is stupid. Why buy toilet roll then? Why decide to keep 3  housecats? \n\nWhat makes it worse is that she actually brags about shoplifting, out in public too; she would occasionally ask to borrow my coat if I was shopping with her (I\u2019d buy my own food) to use it to cover up items she didn\u2019t intend to pay for. It\u2019s embarrassing. \n\nMy mother would ask to use my credit card quite often. I always say no. \nShe would ask me to get her a credit card in MY name, I always say no. \nShe keeps asking for my credit cards : \u201cI\u2019ll help you with your credit score\u201d, I can do that on my own. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s your pin for your bank?\u201d No. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you mine, it\u2019s ****\u201d no. \n\nAnyway. There are a lot of issues that have been ongoing since I can remember. False promises. I hate them. \n\nWhen I was younger, I would have something for so long and she would decide to sell it. Pets, tech, anything like that. I remember the pet cocktaiel we had. I loved him so much. Despite it being her pet, it was me who kept him alive. She never changed his food/or brought it, or sorted out his water. Changed his cage. She sold him. \n\nI got a kitten for my birthday, I was allowed to name him. I adore cats, we\u2019ve always had cats. She used to get rid of our animals quite often. The kitten I had? She got rid. The reason? My asthma was apparently bad. I\u2019m not that allergic to cats. Yet, later on she would get another cat. \n\nThis year she wanted a dog, which, I\u2019m very allergic to. They had a dog during the 4 years I was away. They got rid of that dog because the upkeep was too much, yet I said - I\u2019m very allergic to dogs, and they knew that. \u201cIt\u2019s alright you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d , now last time I lived with dogs, I ended up having a few asthma attacks. My mother has witnessed me almost die from the lack of oxygen in my system from staying with dogs JUST overnight. \n\nOn that topic, another thing that can make my breathing worse - tobacco, smoke, and cannabis. \n\nNow, I said before, I asked her to not smoke it around me, and keep it away from work things and my art stuff. \nThe amount of times I found her in my room puffing away? Too many. I would get quite annoyed and keep asking her not to. I get the usual \u201cit\u2019s alright. You\u2019ll be fine, this tobacco doesn\u2019t yellow paper\u201d. How hard is it to respect a, more than reasonable request. And does she think I\u2019m fucking stupid?\n\nTopic of mental health, mine is declining. Quickly. \n\nI\u2019m the kind of person to keep things to myself ; I don\u2019t like troubling anyone with my issues, or making people worry. I\u2019m quiet still. But I\u2019m becoming more unstable and I\u2019m trying to heal in a toxic environment where I\u2019m always criticised, walking on eggshells, guilt tripped. I know now that I\u2019m not getting anywhere. \n\nIf it weren\u2019t for my partner, I would of probably done something stupid by now. \n\nI\u2019ve been staying over his house (he still lives with parents) for a couple weeks since I\u2019ve been having trouble sleeping alone. He\u2019s been great, doing his god damn best to put a smile on my face.  He\u2019s been with me for doctors appointments with my testing, shed loads of injections (which, she\u2019d actually said she would be there for me but refused to come down) - just been the absolute best for me.\n\nBecause I\u2019ve been staying at his; I\u2019ve been hammered with \u201ccan I have your mattress since you\u2019re not here? And I need it because my knee hurts.\u201d, she sleeps on a mattress that\u2019s on the floor (she chose to get rid of the bed frame..) and every time it\u2019s been a different reason. \u201cYour dad keeps sleeping against the wall\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t get up properly because my knee hurts and I need a second mattress.\u201d \n\nShe always has problems that have actual solutions but chooses not to help herself. She\u2019d rather keep it and use it as something to complain about or use it @ me for guilt tripping. \nDuring this same conversation, she then asks for one of my credit cards - which makes absolutely no sense. When I say no to both, her attitude changes, obviously because she hasn\u2019t got her own way. The \u201cfeel sorry for me voice\u201d and looses interest in any other conversation bc/she doesn\u2019t benefit from it. \n\nAnd later on, I get accused of doing something I haven\u2019t done. \nApparently locking a cat in my room after I popped home to visit; where as she has left the HOUSE cat (who got attacked by next door\u2019s dog) outside at night for a few hours, who has accidentally locked in rooms herself? Yet shouts at me for it when I didn\u2019t do it? \n\nMoving on. \n\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to be around this kind of family? My brother has picked up my mothers \u201cways\u201d, I think my father has given up and just agreeing with it all because it\u2019s easier. \n\nI\u2019ve tried several times to express how I\u2019m feeling about it all and I\u2019m immediately shut out. \u201cI can\u2019t help you.\u201d \u201cYou have to accept it because she has BPD.\u201d ,\u201dyou can\u2019t be angry at her because of her mental health\u201d \u201cyou\u2019ve got to remember that she does these. things\u201d and MORE cushioning, hiding behind the soft pillow-y walls of \u201cI have this, therefore you must accept it or you\u2019re a terrible person\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not as if I kick off over it, I ask to talk to them and be like , hey, this is how this makes me feel or please don\u2019t do this because / yadayada. I WANT them to learn.\n\nI accept mental health, I accept that everyone can have difficulties.\nTrying to justify toxic behaviour by using a mental health issue as a shield is absolute bullshit. How in the fuck is she going to learn if you don\u2019t tell her she\u2019s doing something wrong? How could anyone. \n\nI have ADHD, I don\u2019t use it to treat people like shit. I don\u2019t use it to single people out. I don\u2019t use it to beg for money. I KNOW it\u2019s difficult, but there are ways to better yourself! \n\nI\u2019ve tried showing them this several times; first time got me kicked out, second time resulted in a verbal fight and me just walking away, third time they kind of listened but things snapped back into the cycle days later/ I\u2019ve done it so much that I\u2019m actually just done.\n\n\nI\u2019m done with the abuse, and yet I feel bad for feeing like this. I\u2019ve been conditioned and I know it, but can\u2019t fucking shake the feeling that I\u2019m in the wrong.\n\n\nIs it wrong to not being around people like that? Family or not. \n\nI don\u2019t want to continue being this \u201cthing\u201d to snap at when convenient. I get the piss taken out of me because I like different food, like different things, yet to me? It\u2019s normal. \n\u201cEw curry, you\u2019re a freak.\u201d Every time I make a meal from scratch, it\u2019s always scowled at. Not that I\u2019m bad at cooking; she\u2019s the kind of person to enjoy the jelly and fat from cooked meats, and who eats mushy peas from a cold tin.\n\nI am scared of them. She know what to say to trigger me, she knows what to do to set me off. \nWhy is it me ? I don\u2019t like the unpredictable and uncertainty. Things have always disappeared and it\u2019s why I treasure things and look after them so well.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do in this situation.\n\n(I hope this makes some sense. Been typing for about 2 hours and it\u2019s almost 1am. But thank you very much for reading.)", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I want to delete them but I don't know if I should save them for legal reasons. I haven't pressed charges because I wasn't raped and in my state, what he did was technically legal. Any suggestions? I want them off my phone; I choose not to look at them but every now and then I'm tempted to look at them and they make me sick.\n\nAnyway. I don't know if any of you will relate to this, but I have such conflicting feelings regarding that whole relationship. I mean, it's disgusting and I hate that I was in it and it's just....what he did wasn't okay. But then there's a part of me that knows when he wasn't being sexual/romantic with me and we were doing more friend-type activities, I did have fun. We had inside jokes. And also, dating him helped me figure out I'm gay (I knew I liked girls - thought I could ignore it and just date men because I assumed I liked men, and I was wrong).\n\nI don't know exactly what my point is. I just feel icky looking at those messages. We said I love you and he wanted to marry me and I thought it was just...normal. I hated so much of it but I just assumed I had to get over it because he loved me and I was supposed to be with a man. He would grab me when I said I wasn't comfortable being touched certain places, and I thought that was normal and I was supposed to enjoy it so I quit fighting. It's so crazy looking back on it because my parents kept warning me to be careful and not rush into anything, and I would get irritated because I could not comprehend mindlessly rushing into something sexual. I didn't realize I was gay and that that was the reason for my lack of a desire for sex; I just thought it was normal self-control. Him not using self-control doesn't justify anything. I'm just...rambling, I guess. I feel stupid for thinking I was supposed to like all of this.\n\n(And before I get comments about this...I am seeing a therapist and am doing pretty well most days.

This came with very little warning. \n\n\\- We don't speak for the rest of the month. They come back in December and I reach out. We meet up and decide we still have feelings for eachother (or so I thought).\n\n\\- They would lead me on a lot and then drop me. It would be hot and cold and their end. They eventually put their phone in my face and tried to get a snap chat pic of me to send to the new SO. We had just had a wonderful time together, and it did get flirtatious. Basically cheating on an emotional end. \n\n\\- They leave, call me on my birthday the night before I graduate and tell me i need them for comfort (despite me making every effort not to contact them, and being persistent with it) via phone. They also mention a lot about their SO and act like a total jerk. \n\n\\- They're out of my life at that point. I tell them to leave me alone. They say they'lll leave me alone for a while, but eventually contact me via an online blog that I had forgot i gave them access to. \n\n\\- We talk again, and they give me every indication they miss me and still want me. This goes back and forth; hot and cold on their end all over again. They lead me on and we see eachother again (as if I haven't learned my lesson a second time). \n\n\\- We talk about a friendship, and actually trying.

I would travel to his hometown every weekend and spend a few days with him and his family. Once I invited him to come to my city because I would go to a public pool with some friends and would love it if he could come to meet them. He said he was excited and would do his best to come. One day before the date, we were texting and he didn't mention if he was coming, so I asked. He said he is. I was happy and very excited. That same day, during the night, he texted me and said he won't be able to come because just now he realized his money was stolen. He then said he talked to his sister and she also had money stolen. He proceeded to complain about having their money inside their own home. I get very worried about this and asked if any strange/different people went to his house the last couple days. He said \"no\". I start to also worry because I was there the last weekend and since his family doesn't know me very well yet, his sister might would think I was the one who stole it. I express my worries to him and that's when he says I should not worry about it, no one would ever think such a thing about me. For a fact, he knew the person who stole it: his mother. He then tells a story about how his mother would sometimes go in these stealing sprees and steal money from the whole family. They didn't know why she did it, she just did. I was shocked with the information and was very worried about my mother-in-law being a kleptomaniac. I started comforting him about the whole situation and to apologize about insisting that he came to visit me when his family was going through something like it. Back then, I had never caught him on lie, so I had no reason to even consider he was lying. Many many months down the road, visiting him and his family all weekends, this type of behavior coming from his mother was never once mentioned again.  I didn't even remember this story, until after the break-up, when it all clicked. During the course of the relationship I got to know his mother and don't think she would do something like that and knowing him and his lies, I now totally get it that he actually came up with the whole story with his money being stolen as an excuse not to come to see me. It's laughable to me that he would go to this length as to create his mother had an issue just to avoid telling me he didn't want to come? lol.

Maybe two haha. But I went in for attempting suicide. I was maybe 20.\n\nWhy:  I was in a abusive relationship and my Dad married his fifth wife who at the time manipulated my family into believing I was bad. Because I didn\u2019t do drugs with her. The only present she gave me was a sippy cup and even though I was estatic to get it my brother was upset and I didn\u2019t see why. While all of them received overly extravagant gifts it was a harsh contrast to mine. But I was so happy. She thought I was going to tell them which I wasn\u2019t going to, so she tried to get to me first in her own twisted way. But I didn\u2019t even see it, I was so gullible and happy to simply have someone care enough to give me a gift. My other moms didn\u2019t want kids, they would say they would manipulate my sisters and I to believe things but it was just to marry my Dad. \n\nWhile I was quietly going through the abuse and I asked for help I was told to simply cook more and that would solve it. So I did and all it did was make him expect it from me and more. When I didnt it would make him upset. I tried to save so I could leave him but he\u2019d take my cards lock me in a room in the apartment and gamble it away. I tried going to school and work but he was upset that I was leaving the house. My parents loved him for his money and gifts and he smiled and was charming to them. They told me to clean and cook and that the problem was me. I only loved him because he made me feel less invisible. He was the first I heard ever ask me if I needed something, if I was hungry, cold etc as I wasn\u2019t allowed to have friends growing up this was a  heartwarming gesture for me. I always followed the rules growing up and I never asked for anything. I never expect gifts, holidays or birthdays. I was quiet. He said he would hurt me because I was too good, I was like an angel in his words. I guess looking back I guess I was. I loved everyone I never lied I put everyone first.\n\nWhen I went to live in the ward I was there for five weeks. I remember I was very thin, I wasn\u2019t able to eat for three weeks, since all of the money was gone and I gave the food to my partner at the time. I ate sleeping pills so I would sleep and wouldn\u2019t be hungry. Until I had the silly idea to tale muscle relaxers in the lake to fight the urge to come up for air. I didn\u2019t tell the doctors that I wanted to still hurt myself but they kept me there because I didn\u2019t show emotions they said it was ptsd and dissociative amnesia from parental abuse. They said I was too put together but couldn\u2019t remember my name that I had to stay there so they could fix the issue. I also had to stay there because I was 5.6 87lb. When my Dad came to see me, I didn\u2019t even know who he was.\n\n The nurses cried when they saw me, they where young so that maybe it. Or it was when I told them to keep the jewelry I had with charms from my family and partner. I told them it would look nice on them so they should keep it. They just cried and left. Maybe it was all the girls who had been admitted to the ward that day. \n\nI didn\u2019t tell the doctors about my parents either or childhood. And as my first step mother believed kids where the disease of the planet and would lock me in the basement feeding my sister and I dog food. In fact I believe it made me stronger, I always believed if I could just take all the bad than no one else would have to. My mom would come down and hit us with these wooden sticks she would nail together and my sister and I would take turns, but I learned after a while I didn\u2019t feel it so I\u2019d start taking more and morenof my sisters beatings. But I always found myself imagining someone coming down those steps just to hug me and say it\u2019s gunna be okay. But I wouldn\u2019t do that to anyone of course. I would treat my future kids with so much love and kindness and guidance.\n\nBut maybe it lead me to believe I was trying to fix those memories of my child hood through my abusive relationship. Because he did show up, he did defend me, he did make me feel viable. Like it was going to be okay. Taking his hits, his words being thrown around it felt like I was taking away the pain for him by taking it. Who knows what I was thinking I was sick I am sure now.\n\n\nBut when I was there. I noticed the people in the ward with me had all been through so much pain, mostly having to do with not feeling loved. Loneliness. Who do you meet the most in the mental ward? The nurse told me the most people he would see in the ward would be abused, unloved and people who where ready to simply walk away from everything that they are, along with some drug abusers.\n\nWho do you see the most?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He was sweet and fun at first, but his behaviour changed slowly but surely worse and worse into emotionally abusive and controlling.\n\n\u200b\n\nHe blamed me for a lot of things or would simply say that he never said such a thing or I must have heard it wrong or didn\u2019t understand him properly (so again, my own fault) and what a bad person I was for never listening to him.\n\n\u200b\n\nI put up with it for a year until the \u201cjokes\u201d just got too much. My friends were shocked by what he said and my therapist was too when I first opened up to her. It was very hard because deep inside myself I knew the things weren\u2019t good or normal and a partner shouldn\u2019t treat you like that. Every time he said he was sorry and he seemed to mean it all. He told me he wouldn\u2019t do it again and he didn\u2019t. It was something different every time. The jokes were about my body, my way of doing things to my past. It was very hard not to get mad at him because I knew it would bounce back to me anyway. I felt horrible that I thought things as that he should never have kids or that he was less than a person.\n\n\u200b\n\nWe went to relationship therapy. I was hopeful and okay, but very nervous the first time. This was his first session ever. I didn\u2019t know what to expect. I opened up to the therapist named Beth. She was understanding and asked David a lot of questions about the present and the past. David was quite closed down at first and I could hear the tone in his voice that he didn\u2019t understand the question and got frustrated by them. I cried because of how homesick and difficult things have been between us and my life right now. I haven\u2019t been very happy here. In the end when Beth was out of the room he called me a cry baby as a joke. From that moment on I just died inside. I couldn\u2019t feel anything anymore, also because of the things that happened at home after.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe second session started off good but ended badly. She told me and David that his behaviour has been emotionally abusive, controlling and that he was most likely on the spectrum (autism/Asperger) by hearing from me (I have had 6 sessions individual therapy) and his side. She asked if he would be open for a diagnose so we could work with it and he implied. I had to make a letter filled with any feeling I\u2019ve had for David of Anger, Hurt, Guilt and Love. I wrote 6 pages I think. Beth asked him if he was okay hearing the letter. He responded with that he had heard it all before, so he would be fine. When I was done Beth asked him what he thought of my letter and if he wanted to react to it. He said apart from a few things that he didn\u2019t really have something to say about it. As he said before, he has heard it before. When we got in the car he told me I over exaggerated in the letter and in therapy. He was upset and I asked him If he needed some time alone. He did.\n\n\u200b\n\nLater that night when I slept alone he told me I was not enthusiastic enough to solve the problems or to fix the relationship. I was feeling nothing anymore and I was down with a very troubled mind. Why did he always say he was sorry, but never actually changed his behaviour? Why was he pushing me so much?. He told me that night he resigned out of the relationship. I agreed with him it was for the best and went to sleep. The next day he texted me asking me how my night was and if I wanted to talk. I came forward that we were broken up and if he could leave me alone for now. He was shocked and thought we were on a break, not a break-up. This happened multiple times over the day that he told me he was really sorry, that he got me and my feelings, that he was a bad man and I wrote the truth. \n\n\u200b\n\nHe wrote me a very long letter with all the sorry in the world on any point I had in the letter with acknowledgement of his actions. I felt bad for him and I felt guilty but I did not change my mind. I was intimate with him that night as he was having panic attacks and cried. He could not stop blaming himself and crying. I felt bad for him and I was mad at him. He didn\u2019t have the right to be sad now or even upset. He ignored me when I cried and now I was there for him. I couldn\u2019t just leave him there that just didn\u2019t feel right. I did feel some feelings, but they were more of the hope at the moment I think because he seemed sincere.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe next day he tried so hard. He tried to make sure I had it easy, tried to have a good time with me and to be there for me. We did some things in the house together and he helped a lot. He cried with me and told me I was everything to him and that he was so in love with me. the bad thing was that it did have an effect on me. I started to look at him with a positive view again but I knew I would enter the same circle if I forgave and forgot again.\n\n\u200b\n\nHe left now to his family and tried so hard to get another chance (must have been already the 100th chance by now) he asked me to please stay exclusive and not to date for at least 3 weeks. After 3 weeks he would like to talk. To see if he still has a chance. I very strongly implied that I needed space and time and I didn't really see it and I just needed time and space. He almost begged me to meet up after 3 weeks\u2019 time and I implied after a while. I felt bad for him and guilty.\n\n\u200b\n\nI had my individual therapy session yesterday where my personal therapist (who works together with the relationship therapist) told me I made the right decision. She told me that he won't change. She also told me that she has seen it often and she has a lot of couples in therapy with children where the dad is on the spectrum and blames the mother. She told me that living like that is very hard and that I am very young. She was also worried about me because he has \"grabbed\" me before. She tried to be there for me but I was quite scared but also confident in a way.\n\n\u200b\n\nNow I am here writing this all out asking for some support. I am all alone in a country where I may be \u201cknow\u201d 5 people (co-workers). I have no support system here and a job I\u2019m overqualified for. I just got my visa, but I am very scared. Scared for the future that might be in my home country again (Europe). Scared to face him again and lose my boundaries again. I don\u2019t really know what things might help and how I can calm myself down. I feel guilty and tense during the day together with a bit of heartache because I once did love him and made the move for him to be with him.\n\n\u200b\n\nThanks for reading and responding if you have anything to say or to add.\n\n\u200b\n\nTL;DR I was in an emotionally abusive and controlling relationship that I just can't ignore any longer. After I broke up with David he realised it and acted like he was a changed man and told me that he was and would be like this every day from now on if I gave him another chance. I am conflicted and very hurt and scared. My therapist told me he will not change and that it is best for my mental health to leave him. I want to, but I feel bad for him as well. The things he has said and done to make me feel less than a human I will never be able to forgive or forget. I\u2019m in a not very known country now on my own and I feel insecure.\n\n\u200b\n\nSome facts to make this threat worthy :\n\nI am 22 years old and David is 24. I am from Europe and he is from New Zealand. The things that he has said and done were on Reddit multiple times like a post that was named \"AITA for wearing a skirt that makes my bf feel uncomfortable?\" and many people told me what my and our therapist told me too. I feel relieved but more fear now. I am happy with my choice and I know it is the right one. We were in a relationship for a year and 2 months. I have been living in Australia since December.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Their behavior towards me crossed the line from typical arguing to abuse somewhere around adolescence, and continued to increase in frequency and severity over time. Most of it took place when my parents weren't around, but what did happen in front of my mom, she generally rugswept or just tried to discipline my twin but it didn't help. \n\nThings got so bad that I informed my parents I would move out the second I turned 18 if they didn't get the situation under control. However, they thought I was referring to the blowout fights they would have with my twin, not the fact that I was living in constant fear of them. Things settled down to an unacceptable but livable level of sulky misery and I toughed it out until I got married 1 1/2 years later. I am currently living overseas while my amazing partner goes to graduate school, and we will be home this time next year. \n\nHere's where the dilemma comes in: while FaceTiming my mom, I decided to tell her about some of the physical abuse. She got very emotional and apologized, and we have not really discussed it since. My dad, as far as I know, has no clue any of it happened. After lots of tears and discussing with my partner, I have decided to tell them everything when we get back home, and I'm already stressed out about it. \n\nHow do I explain why I couldn't/didn't tell them during the abuse or afterwards? Is it fair for me to ask them to manage their reactions to this information? (one of my biggest fears in telling them is that they will cry and get super emotional about it, which I don't feel ready to deal with. I tend to address the abuse when I do speak about it in an almost clinical manner, which keeps me from freaking out about it) Does anyone else have any stories about telling their parents/others about past abuse? I would especially appreciate any advice/insight from others who have been abused by siblings. Thank you in advance.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

And then after a break up he did. He made an emotional plea saying he was having nightmares without me and he loved me and wanted a life with me and babies. Because of that I was fooled into thinking he loved me and tried to make it work. \n\nI lost count of how many times he dumped me. Usually because I couldn\u2019t stand smiling and going with it anymore and had to talk about how I felt. He was always hot and cold and emotionally distant. And then sometimes not and he was affectionate and things were perfect. When we met we were both trying to get over exes. Mine ghosted me. His happened to be half his age. It was a huge red flag and I should have turned heel and ran. But I didn\u2019t. \n\nHe talked nonstop about his ex in the beginning and how much he loved her and how he tried to kill him self over her. How he would never love anyone like that again and never trust anyone. So I\u2019ve always hated her and resented her because she had everything. She was his actual girlfriend and I never had that title. I was just his friend. Even after almost a year. I spent the night at his place half the week. I was always insecure because of her. Wondered what he did with her he didn\u2019t with me. \n\nWell last night I found out something I didn\u2019t want to. He said it purposefully to hurt me and it worked. I wanted to die when he told me it. He never went down on me. Maybe three times. I asked him about it because I spoiled him with oral all the time. He said he didn\u2019t go down on her much. It was a lie. He threw it in my face and said\n\n \u201cI went down on her all the time \ud83d\ude0a and put a smiley face on the end to twist the knife a little more. \n\nI finally got it out of him he was never in love with me. That she was one of two people he was ever in love with. Like that makes it ok to use me for almost a year and lead me on believing I was the one fucking the relationship up because I couldn\u2019t \u201cjust go with it and be happy.\u201d He said to me he held back on other things he could have told me that would have destroyed me and saying \u201cyour best relationship ever is a lie.\u201d Prior to this he resigned himself to being in a relationship with me. He said \u201cyou finally have what you want be happy.\u201d I\u2019m 12 weeks pregnant. I knew he was just doing it for the baby. He was just putting on a mask and going through the motions. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and called him on it. So of course he breaks up with me again saying I deserved to be ghosted, I messed it up myself by never being happy no matter what he did. He always hangs onto things we fought about from the beginning and throws it in my face. It hurts so much that he hangs onto all that while he\u2019s acting like he loves me on the other hand when things are good. \n\nI\u2019ve never been lied to on that level. He was so good at faking emotions just to get what he wanted. I was just a warm body in bed to him. I can\u2019t get over it. It\u2019s like things just get worse. Each person is worse than the next. He hurt me so bad it\u2019s hard to get up in the morning. I don\u2019t want to live anymore. I have no hope for my future anymore. I don\u2019t have the ability to trust people anymore. Sex isn\u2019t worth it. I\u2019m just going to end up celibate. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m there anymore. I thought I felt like that last time. At least he actually loved me. This time I feel like the entire thing was all a lie. Every intimate moment is recorded in my brain and all I can remember now is him being selfish and knowing it was because he didn\u2019t love me. He said he did. It felt like he did. But I don\u2019t even think he knows what love is. \n\nI have other children and that\u2019s honestly the only thing keeping me alive. I know I have to get over it and get on with my life. I have a job and people who need me and I can\u2019t. But there\u2019s no part of me that wants to be awake and alive anymore. I don\u2019t know how to change that. Therapy and pills won\u2019t change what happened and won\u2019t take away the memories torturing me. That I still want him even after he killed everything that was hopeful and snuffed out my light. I know it\u2019s cliche but I feel so dead inside. I don\u2019t have any close friends. I don\u2019t have any close family. My house is literally falling apart and my job is my only positive because at least that\u2019s a steady paycheck even if it is meager and fast food workers get paid more than me. \n\nAll I have is my kids, my job, the gym. Music and gaming. I guess I\u2019ve been through this before, but never on this level. I honestly know he is a sociopath now. It would have been easier if he just gutted me and left me for dead.

You looked me in the face for YEARS and lied. YOU messaged ME last March and wanted to apologize, because you were wrong and should of done things differently. I foolishly believed you, when everything and everyone was telling me otherwise. That day you told me that a female was coming over, I KNEW you were up to something. \u201cShe is just a friend, babe!\u201d, you told me. I\u2019m glad I came home from work that day, at least I know I prevented you from cheating on me then. You had me looking STUPID. This girl telling me that she feels kind of bad, because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to step on anyone\u2019s toes\u201d and played it off perfectly. Meanwhile, she\u2019s texting you in my presence, AT OUR HOUSE. The one who \u201cdidn\u2019t want to step on anyone\u2019s toes\u201d, was planning when to leave to make SURE she wasn\u2019t there when I got home just an hour or two beforehand. Then, Orie\u2019l... again, same story... \u201cShe\u2019s just a friend, honey!\u201d, constantly.  I caught you with a post on Marco Polo directly, and you STILL argued me down that it wasn\u2019t what it looked like. She\u2019s only a friend and a good bit older than you, so no worries, right? Why say that you would \u201cleave your ways behind\u201d if it means being with her, if she\u2019s only a friend and NOTHING AT ALL more? Exactly, it\u2019s what I said it was all along. Plus, just random things here and there... Like, meeting females when you get off work or during your lunch breaks. I told you multiple times your paychecks weren\u2019t adding up, but you said that I just didn\u2019t calculate it correctly. You spoke to all these females, and did so many wrongs by me, but when you get addressed for messing with someone\u2019s cousin, what do you say? \u201cNot true! I\u2019ve only messed with Page for two years\u201d, because you were a perfect significant other and did no wrong at all. You \u201chated\u201d LeLe when she left you for being the dog that you are, because she was pregnant with Davion. She was fed up with your shit! She couldn\u2019t take it anymore! Yes, everyone wants to make things work for the baby, but people can only take so much and you pushed her to that point! Based on what I\u2019m told, you did it to Mika, as well. Now, guess what... You just successfully did it to me, too. You look me in my eyes and lie to me originally, even when I have all evidence proving otherwise, that\u2019s MY bad. I should of left you then, but I thought I saw better in you. You came back around a few months later and apologized and seems genuine and honest, that\u2019s YOUR bad. You knew you were lying, and you STILL weren\u2019t telling me the truth about things when I would ask \u201cSo, did this happen or you seriously didn\u2019t do that?\u201d, and just kept saying that you never, ever cheated on me at all. You lied about an apology, pretty much. What did I do? Forgave you and now we are here. This past year has been flooded with lies since August primarily, too. Me and everyone else KNOWS you\u2019re lying, Brandon. I\u2019ve known you for 6 years, I KNOW when you\u2019re lying. Yet, even knowing that, you STILL choose to lie. You get mad at me when I get upset or angry seemingly out of nowhere, but it\u2019s because I know better! I know I\u2019m just being force fed whatever you feel like giving to me at that moment, but I still chose to let it slide. I was letting things slide so much, you were ice skating. Lying from the start and even when it\u2019s blatantly obvious you are lying, I still believe you, that\u2019s my bad. You apologizing a few months later while still not being honest, that\u2019s your bad. You still lying after all this time, even over things that truly do not matter, and getting angry with ME when I get frustrated because you just are incapable of honesty, that\u2019s both of our faults. Yours, because you did that knowing you were wrong and it isn\u2019t right. Mine, because I didn\u2019t deserve to be spoken to a lot of the ways I have allowed myself to me lately, nor should I of stayed by ANYONE who is knowingly and willingly looking directly into my eyes and lying for no real reason, at times. You don\u2019t have any idea what that is like. It took five years for me to show it, but I started getting noticeably bothered when it was obvious you are lying about something and just would not be truthful at all and that made you mad at me. When you got mad or upset with me, you got awfully cruel and aggressive. There is no way, if you are in a sound and sane mindset, that you can look back at a lot of things you\u2019ve said to me and validate them. Even during that, I loved you unconditionally. For six years, I tried to show you true, unconditional love. The screenshots I sent that I just came across are truly irrelevant now, but I imagine since I have the evidence that you did lie, you are going to tell me that you didn\u2019t lie and that you were just playing around in these texts? That\u2019s what I presume I\u2019ll get, anyway. However, the point is that I hate you. I hate you just as much as I loved you. I was the one person that would always be there for you and be in your corner, no matter what you said or did to me. I used to see better in you, that\u2019s why I always slid things under the rug, or pushed them aside after awhile. You\u2019re not a bad person, but you do bad things. You know better, because you\u2019ve shown me. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re doing wrong, it\u2019s that you know but you don\u2019t care. I spent six entire years of my life hoping you would change your ways and realize you had someone in front of you that was genuinely wanting the best Brandon that you are fully capable of being. Unfortunately, either you\u2019re incapable of that or I was wrong when I kept telling people, \u201cNo, I swear he\u2019s a good guy! He\u2019s not usually like this...\u201d, and multiple things of that sort to everyone else who was begging me to run as far away from you as possible as quickly as I could. Brandon, as much as I hate to say it, you are the reason Adriana passed away... You have no idea the physical pain I was in a few days later when my body couldn\u2019t repair the damage quick enough and I started bleeding internally, then all the emotional pain I still deal with daily because she\u2019s not here. She was supposed to be my baby, and she was taken from me in one of the worst ways possible. The heartbreak that that caused me is worse than any you\u2019ve ever made me feel. Even after that, I agreed to get back together with you. I\u2019m far from perfect, and I\u2019m not the best female out there by far, but I can promise you that you will never find that degree of unconditional companionship that I provided you again in your lifetime. Now, by the grace of whatever fertility fairy there is, I\u2019m carrying ANOTHER daughter by you. You don\u2019t even check on her, or me in terms of the pregnancy... You are too busy thinking of the next thing you can do or say to trigger me or set me off that would top the last. For all these reasons combined, I don\u2019t want you around Aubreigh at all, unfortunately. I don\u2019t trust, nor do I want to risk, you doing the same things to her. I don\u2019t want her constantly second guessing her sanity when she KNOWS that you are telling her something incorrect or blatantly lying but you tell her she\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t want her feeling like she has to walk on eggshells around you, because she doesn\u2019t want to set you off. I don\u2019t want her to get to the point that she\u2019s not just going to sit down and be quiet when you tell her she\u2019s wrong, and she challenges you with the evident TRUTH and you get aggressively angry with her. I don\u2019t want ANYONE, let alone her father, to get upset or angry with her and say even a quarter of the things you\u2019ve said to me to her. After looking at the past six years, I just cannot trust that you wouldn\u2019t do that to her. It was so easy for you to do it to the one person who was so unconditional with you, and tried to make your life so much better and happier... It would be just as easy for it to be done to Aubreigh. This little girl would love you unconditionally as her father, and she would be one of the best things in your life. Given the type of person that you are, I truly want you to sign your parental rights away. I do not want child support from you, I do not want you to see her, I do not want you to purchase anything for her. She will know who you are and that you are her father, I wouldn\u2019t ever deny her that information. When it comes up, I\u2019ll make sure I tell her WHY this happened in as age appropriate language as needed. I know you probably didn\u2019t read the first four sentences of this, but if you made it this far, when can you sign these papers and just get this over with?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Most of the abuse happened at a long distance over text and video. His opinion was central to my life at that time, and when I left him, I didn\u2019t know how I would survive without his influence. Because of the distancing between my abuser and I, I was able to keep the entire relationship a secret from beginning to end. \n\nAt this point, I have told many friends that I was abused in my teens, but not at what ages. My therapist knows his first name and the timeline, which is more than I have said to anyone else. I\u2019ve also destroyed the messages between my abuser and I, and any gifts he gave. I\u2019m doing pretty well now, overall, and I don\u2019t think about it very often. \n\nAll this is to say, sometimes I forget what happened to me, then suddenly I remember. Because I don\u2019t have momentos to remind me, and I\u2019m the only one aware of his full identity, sometimes it\u2019s unbelievable that this happened TO ME.

I'd have one or two shifts, have a panic attack and end up not going back. We had no money and he said his credit is ruined so I'll need to get out loans... So I did.\n\nI racked up a huge amount of debt and luckily my parents paid it off for me telling me to never get a loan again. I said I wouldn't dare.\n\nThis was about 2 1/2 years ago and 6 months after that things were getting even worse for me. I tried to kill myself again, I was kicked of uni, I couldn't get a job, I was alone in a tiny room I couldn't pay for and things were even worse for me and my nex (partner at the time).\n\nHis living situation was about to change and he was moving into a smaller room in his parents house meaning it'd be difficult for me to stay over so the week before the moving happened he wanted me to visit.\n\nI was severely depressed, I had no money at all and he'd get angry at me when I was depressed and tell me to not even bother visiting if I'm going to be miserable all the time. One time I did speak up and say I didn't think I could cheer up for this trip and I was in a really bad place. He went mental, threatening to break up, asking me why can't I just pretend to be happy for him etc. I profusely apologised and said I'd do my best.\n\nI had only enough money to get there and told him I really couldn't afford seeing him, asking if we can meet up later when I get my next unemployment through. Nope, it had to be now, there's no point in me visiting or us being together if it's not this certain week. He told me if I could cover getting to him (using the last of my money), he'd cover me getting back.\n\nSo I agreed, thanked him, then a few days later when I'm sorting tickets he does a 180 and says he can't pay for the ticket.\n\nI told him I can't come over then, I just can't afford it. Then he got angry again. Asking me why am I not even going to try to get money for him. How I must not love him etc.\n\nHe told me to just borrow from my mum and I couldn't. If she found out why I needed it she'd refuse, I didn't want to lie to her and I already borrowed more than enough.\n\nSo I had to get another loan, I felt sick when it went through. I hated myself for getting it but I was afraid of what he'd do.\n\nBreaking up to him was never breaking up. If I 'accepted' the break up he'd get angry, he had threatened to go to my family before. I didn't know what he'd do if I accepted him leaving me while I was over 2 hours away from him.\n\nSo I went down and visited him, it was hell. Everyday he'd have a go at me, everyday I cried. Everyday I was accused of something, I ruined everyday, it was exhausting and on the final night I remember it being so much I went outside for a smoke and I sobbed, I sobbed and sobbed... Loudly\n\nI whispered to myself 'I can't do this anymore, I can't do this, I want to die, I want to die..' just over and over\n\nUp until I was leaving it was still shit, I went back to where I was living after 4 days with him and 4 days later, I tried to kill myself with 32 pills.\n\nI remember him telling me he didn't care when I was in the hospital\n\nThe day after my mum put her foot down and came to get me, I moved in with family.\n\nAbout a month later I got the courage to leave him for good.\n\nIt's been nearly 2 years since attempting suicide and it's been hard and I've tried so hard to make my life better. I never ever wanted to be like that again.\n\nI pretty much blocked out a lot of stuff that happened, I ignored a lot of it, including the loan.\n\nNow the loan company are threatening legal action.\n\nI can easily pay it within a month, my credit score is already fucked so that doesn't matter. It can be sorted and its not the end of the world.\n\nHearing that though... Its just reminded me of all this, everything I put up with from him. I'm nearly in tears remembering it. I want it behind me already but it all still haunts me.\n\nI know people say some people attempt suicide for attention. I feel like mine looks like a clear cut case of that. I didn't take many pills and although I got very very ill that night and was sick for weeks afterwards. It may not seem like a real attempt.\n\nBut I look back and I know it was. I had a note ready, I factory reset my phone. I was absolutely ready to die. It actually haunts me a little I tried to cut my life short.\n\nI'm these last two years, it's always been the small moments that I took a mental photo of like tasting a great dish or hearing a funny story or playing a fun game and I'd tell myself 'I'm so glad I'm alive for this.'\n\nI was such an idiot", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

They happen 2-3 times a week only because he doesn't want to force them (bro: set expectations; they're almost 4 and 6!), because they \"have to put their lives on hold,\" and they dont want to talk. He is effectively cutting me out of their lives (encourages the girls call his GF 'mom', among a slew of other shit) and making shit worse than it needs to be. \n\nAny communication between him and I (seriously I am SO good in keeping it about the girls 99% of the time, but I HAD to defend myself tonight) devolves into him shaming me, belittling me, calling me names, and general shitty projection that I can't handle anymore. \n\nIf I don't get custody, I don't know what I'm going to do. There's appeals, okay... but that still means I have to continue going through this hell/limbo.

I'm still not sure I should even post about this one...*\n\nI was in my first year of high school and I'd liked this guy for a while and he apparently he had liked me back, then he moved and I heard nothing from him for a while. Later the next year I decided to date one of my friends and it was the best relationship I'd ever had, lasting 3 years! Towards the end of our relationship he started getting more and more upset with me having guy friends and I  couldn't take it. The breakup was hard and around that time the guy messaged me on Facebook telling me he'd moved back and wanted to hang out. After the breakup the guy (lets call him W from now on) started to flirt with me and make me feel better. Later the same week we met up at a park near my house and we both brought friends so it wouldn't be too awkward for us. He made me feel so special that day and every other day after. We'd stay on the phone for hours just talking about random things that made us happy.\n\nLater on W asked me out and obviously I agreed because I really cared about W and saw a real relationship with him. About a week after we got together I began to bring him things to try and get his attention again but he wouldn't ever do anything for me, even the nice compliments and kind words stopped. I kept trying and wanted to call him and he'd say no. So in an effort to bring our relationship I invited W to a festival, he'd have to stay the night at my place so he would be able to go. He had been staying over a bit but he'd have to sleep in the room next to mine since I lived with my parents back then. He had asked to sleep in my room with me and finally my father let him. That night he tried to have sex with me, I said no because I hadn't ever done it and I was scared and not ready. He reluctantly said fine and  fell asleep by me.\n\nHe began staying over more and every time he'd ask to have sex. I'd always say no because I wasn't ready and one night when it was time for bed he went into my room with me and locked the door behind him. He had never done that so I questioned it and he said not to worry about it. I guess that should have been a red flag but I trusted him for some stupid reason. He turned off the light and we got into bed as per usual and he slowly began pushing me up against the wall since my bed was against it. I got a bit worried and asked why he was doing this and he just told me to be quiet. I think you know what happened next and I kept saying to stop but eventually I gave up and stopped trying to get away. I didn't want to tell my parents because he could have easily pinned it on me wanting to and then regretting it. So I kept quiet.\n\nI stayed with W because he had started to make me feel more special and began to compliment me once again. Until he asked me to stay at his place. I agreed because he had apologized for what he'd done and I believed him. He would go on to make this his pattern. He'd do it, then apologize. Since I had been in an abusive relationship before I was easy to manipulate and I'd believe anything he'd say. The thing that broke me was one day I was staying over and I was pretty happy. Then his friend showed up and had some weed. They wanted me to smoke it and see what would happen but I didn't want to because my parents told me if I ever did I could get really sick. I have really bad asthma so smoking in general was off limits, even being around it hurt me. So I told them no and they didn't take no for an answer. One of them held me down while the other would blow smoke in my face, causing me to have a really bad asthma attack. It managed to I guess somewhat get me high because I couldn't see straight. I felt dizzy and I started to get scared so I went into W's room to calm down. Well his friend passed out on the couch so he went into the room and proceed to abuse me. He would insult me and pull my hair really hard until he finished.\n\nThis one time broke me and I ended up staying at his house for a few days longer because I couldn't face my parents... during these few days he got progressively more abusive and would choke me. I took it and took all his words to heart. His dad ended up getting involved and began insulting me and he would make me clean up after him and W. This went on for around a year, he abused me, raped me, cheated on me, used me for money, almost killed me by trying to get me high, let his friend watch him do things to me, and I stayed because I'm stupid. I never told anyone, not even my family because I was so scared of what he'd do to me. Now that I look back on it it's all my fault, I could have seen it coming and gotten out. I could have told someone. I could have left after the first time. I could have been better. If I was better and just let him do it in the first place he may not have hit me. I live with all these thought of if I had been better he wouldn't have hit me, he wouldn't have kicked me, he wouldn't have yelled, he wouldn't have called me all those names..... Maybe if I was a better girlfriend someone else would love me like he loved me, maybe one day someone will love me even though I'm worthless.... it's been 2 years and I still love him... I hate myself for it....\n\n*I keep rereading this and it's my fault this happened... I keep thinking I shouldn't even post it and I should just hold it in or maybe just take my life and end all the pain now... I'm going to post it anyway but I may just delete this...*", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Gaslighting: he tells me a while ago his family bought his home but when we fight over him cleaning an item of dog hair(s) from my belongings it turns into a different kind of fight. He turns it into me saying he should get rid of his dog (instead of just dry cleaning the item) and how I discount what he\u2019s \u201cput into\u201d the house although that\u2019s all family money. How I\u2019m not good enough and I don\u2019t live independent enough for him and how he hates my dog and how terrible my dog is.

But how do we know if we aren't just being irrational.  The best thing I could think of was to provide a list of clues for me.  *I didn't think each of these individually meant I was unsafe, rather it was the accumulation.*  Yet, I still doubt myself and wonder if I'm irrational to feel unsafe.\n\nThem, romantic context, dating partner:\n\n-  Telling me early on that their roommate said our signs are incompatible.  I don't believe in astrology, but the comment made me feel self conscious.\n-  Telling me that their roommate didn't like me, and I barely even knew them or had interacted with them.\n-  they were always profusely thankful whenever I'd do certain things, like ask them questions, or listen to them talk for longer than 3 minutes (they always seemed self conscious about talking for extended periods), or expressing affection in some way.  This heightened gratitude made me feel awkward.  I don't know if it was wrong of me, but I eventually expressed to them that it made me feel uncomfortable, or that I was trying to understand it.\n-  carried out an April fools joke where they told me they had found someone else to go to a concert with them.  I took the joke in stride, but it felt slightly off.\n- Telling me that they used to shoplift.  He apparently no longer does, but the random confession felt odd.\n-  their texting me felt more often than felt appropriate for 3-4 weeks into dating, like always good mornings, checking in, good nights, etc.\n-  early on, they set up a shared music playlist for us.  I noticed that he would add very overt love songs consistently.  I felt weird asking about it, but I did.  They said they hadn't realized and that they tend to focus on musical aesthetics, not lyrics.  This just felt insincere to me, but I still wasn't sure.  \n-  over time, as I'd calmly and politely reference little tidbits that felt odd, they said I was trying to get in their head and assign intention.  They called me a \"Nancy Drew\". \n-  a month into dating, they revealed they'd be moving from our city likely in the near future, had travel aspirations with their career.  This was kind of upsetting to me.  It was a detail I wish I had known about sooner.  I have no interest in rushing a relationship, but this detail made me wonder if I should still pursue it.  They ended up clarifying it as something more vague.  Like, I got a weird sense they were just saying it, not dishonestly, but also not as serious of a plan when they first mentioned it.\n-  I had a leg injury with mysterious origin.  He's a professional dancer and could empathize.  I went to various practitioners and did a lot of work to heal it, and at one point he expressed that it may be something I'd always have.  I mean, I was kind of expecting the worst, too.  But it seemed like an odd comment.  A month later it was healed and I figured it out.\n-  two months into dating, he revealed to me that he had an incurable and infectious std.  We had not been sexual up to this point, but I was still gobsmacked (for various reasons).  I later found out that he had never actually been formally diagnosed, only visually by a doctor (itself, a grave error).  It felt odd to me to live for six years thinking you have an std, without ever being tested, but I also understand you can be a product of a faulty medical system.  Still, I'd want to know.  I couldn't imagine going six years not knowing with certainty, but still telling others with certainty.\n-  as I was processing the std, researching, etc, he seemed to continually struggle to get tested without health insurance.  It was stressful for both of us, and at one point he broke down asking me if I'd break up with him if he had it.  I was still processing everything and didn't even know if he did have it.  While I felt badly for his situation and tried to comfort in any way I could, the question also felt pressuring, because I was still trying to understand my risks (also having a health trauma history).  I felt very afflicted and guilty for having to process it.\n-  when I asked one time what our relationship meant to him, he said we were friends with a few things in common.  This was despite a very clear romantic context.  He also described me as a distraction.  These really hurt.  And his explanations for my misunderstanding felt still confusing.\n-  Telling me his roommate said I needed to get new shoes.  When he sensed I was uncomfortable by the statement, he said that he likes my shoes.\n-  Telling me his step dad used to call him a sociopath and pathological liar growing up.  He expressed a tad confusion of self of if it was true or not.  When I ask if he thinks he is either, the answer is so convoluted and lacking in a direct answer.\n-  Telling me on three separate occasions about a closeted friend of his who is married and is madly in love with him.  Seeming to be fascinated by the situation.  Then telling me he's handsome then showing me pictures of him.\n-  over time, as I reference some of these things, his responses seem to give a kind of reasonable answer, but I'm left feeling odd about them regardless.\n-  revealing to me once that he felt he liked me more than I liked him.  This comparison hurt, because I genuinely did like him a lot and highly valued so many things.  The relationship felt significant and important to me.  After he saw that I was hurt, he changed his meaning.\n-  an overall sense of guardedness on his end, or a sense that he is trying to adapt to me, like people please.  But that makes me feel uncomfortable.  I want to just see him as he is, rather than someone who is trying to make themselves likeable.\n- an overall sense that his language is confusing, or even maybe dishonest.  \n\nI *feel* unsafe with the accumulation of these factors over time.  But because of my trauma background, I wonder if I'm actually being unsafe or have an abusive mindset in that I believe the feeling I get at times.  That, at times, I believe that what I feel is the truth, even if I don't tell him.  (But mostly, automatically and initially I doubt, and try to give him the benefit and try to understand his vantage).  I actually have become dysregulated *by the experience*, not being dysregulated or confused or paranoid before (at least as a single person).  I've never tried to assert that my perception is the right one, but I do try and understand what he means by these various things that catch my attention.\n\nThe part I struggle with is that I *have* had this unsafe feeling before in romantic dynamics.  But I've also had experiences where I didn't.  I don't want to be a victim, nor do I feel I walk around assuming such, but part of me wonders if maybe I am enacting a victim complex by reading too much into things here.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He seemed so nice and we dated for almost a year. He would show genuine concern for me, he helped me be less self-hating, and I didn\u2019t feel as terrible as I usually do when we talked. We didn\u2019t get together mutually, we started dating because he wore me down. There was a period over a month where I didn\u2019t talk to him because the wearing me down, amongst the many problems I had with my mental health, made me feel suicidal. I\u2019ve had terrible problems with suicidal thoughts, OCD, depression, anxiety, and feelings of paranoia stemming from being anxious. So when I started feeling better I started talking to him again. At this point we weren\u2019t together yet, we were still just friends. Then he broke my resolve and I finally got together with him. We were an item, but I didn\u2019t acknowledge that we were anything, I didn\u2019t say that I loved him, and I didn\u2019t really open up to him for months. This is where it gets messy.\n\nHe would pressure me into doing things for him and opening up to him. It would send me into a downward spiral when I got off of the phone with him. It was awful. But I ignored it because at the time he was the only person that genuinely seemed to care about my mental well being. I did things for him that I wouldn\u2019t normally do, sending illicit photos and videos. (This is important later on) he was always grateful and would shower me with compliments about my physical appearance. But I hated every bit of it. I hate everything about my physical appearance and my body, it makes me sick if I look at myself for too long. \nBut again I ignored that because he was so nice to me. I was on and off with him at this point because we both had a really busy life and it was just hard to be texting someone you\u2019re having an intense relationship with all the time. The problem was though, that when we were off, he would still text me like we were friends. Because that\u2019s what he wanted me to be. I hated that and I tried to ignore him sometimes, but then that was met with threats of ending his own life. It would cause me to have severe panic attacks, I\u2019d start obsessively thinking about what if I got a message from his family telling me he\u2019d ended his life, I started obsessively thinking about death. It was extremely unhealthy.\n\nThen we got back together and I didn\u2019t want to be with him so I asked if we could take a break. Then he started blackmailing me. He said that if I didn\u2019t give him what he wanted and if I didn\u2019t stay with him that he\u2019d post those things I\u2019d sent him online. I couldn\u2019t let that happen because some of the images had my face in them and I didn\u2019t want those to be everywhere.  So I did whatever he wanted me to do, I did things to myself for his own pleasure, I hurt myself for his amusement, I gave him money. But then he started making me post the ones that didn\u2019t have my face anyway. I felt sick that people were looking at my body, and that it was on display. I wanted to end my life right then and there. I hated myself for letting this happen. But I was terrified, I thought he\u2019d try to end my career with those photos, I still feel like he might, and I have waking nightmares about it to this day. \n\nEventually I got to the point where I hated myself so much that I snapped. I told him to stay the fuck away from me, and that I\u2019d get a restraining order and sue him if he tried to pull anything. Then he stalked me for 3 months. He hacked into 2 of my emails, I don\u2019t know what he was trying to do but luckily I stopped him before he did anything.

This man is the epitome of evil. He's a self proclaimed sex addict who has been so cold and just can't understand why I'm usually not excited to have sex with him. He gave me the silent treatment for 2 weeks after my father died because he didn't want to deal with it. He's called me useless and a cunt (his favorites) in front of our kids. He has mood swings where he stomps around, slamming things and throws my belongings in the trash. He has publicly humiliated me on more than one occasion. He's damn near bankrupted us with gambling debt and personal loans to pay bills he didn't pay when he gambled  the bill money away. This is something he decided to tell me the day after I returned from burying my mother.  Here's where I have to take a deep breath. He sexually abuses me while I'm asleep. Everytime I've woken up and freaked out on him he goes into another tantrum so I pretend I'm asleep and just roll over in a position where he has to stop. The scariest part is that he's not doing it to get me going for sex because when I move he backs off until he thinks I'm asleep again and just starts over. I think he likes the dominance or sneakiness of the act. One month ago he admitted that he regularly gets hookers when he travels. He makes my skin crawl. If I had family around I would have left already. Im so sick that I fell for this monster and left everything I knew to be in this horrible situation.\n\nEdit: I want to apologize for not being able to respond until now. I generally don't have much down time between working, the kids or his tirades which throw everything out of whack until he calms down. But I appreciate every response and want to try to cover any topics brought up from you guys. I apologize if this update is disorganize.  I know it will only get worse since his blowouts have escalated.  I have been planning and saving. I've called shelters but they were either full or really didn't have alot of suggestions for resources once I stated he hasn't actually hit me. I don't fault them for prioritizing women in those situations but it left me with the only option of getting out slowly once I can afford it. I know I need a counselor so I plan to reach out to one once I'm out because he monopolizes my time so right now there is just no free time for me to see one. As far as a support system, I literally have just 2 friends I've  reached out to for support. He has alienated any other friends we've tried to make here. He is very controlling with finances and I've only been working full-time for around 4 months. I fully believe his threats of making me miserable if I ever leave so I'm expecting the worst to come out of him. I have never considered suicide at all so no worries there. I could never leave my babies to a life at his Mercy. I'd give my life for their safety but obviously hope I never have to. I generally don't know how bad the finances are aside from a few outrageous loans that showed up on my credit report. I've already disputed them since I never signed for them and they are supposed to be removed which takes time to show up. I am prepared for this to be a long and exhausting battle but my mind set is he can have the monetary assets as long as we can agree on a decent parenting plan, he is reasonable with dividing basic necessities and he keeps HIS debt. He can sell the house to pay alot of that off but I'd be forced to file bankruptcy if I ever had to be responsible for even one loan. Some of them are more than what I make in a year. I don't care if I'm a broke single mom from here on out as long as I can come home to my babies in a peaceful household. My babies already say things like \"daddy hates you\" so they damage is there but I hope to someday have them understand that this is not a healthy relationship. I have 3 girls and pray they never fall victim to someone like him so undoing their current sense of normal will likely take a long time but it's something I'll have to figure out for their emotional well-being. Thank you for all the responses. This forum has made me come to terms with the kind of monster I'm dealing with and I've stopped believing I deserve this nightmare. My one true regret is that I left my home state and family- setting myself up to be at his mercy. I should have listened to my gut that he was too good to be true but honestly thought I had finally found my person.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was sexually abused on more than one occasion but it's been almost ten years since the last event. I'm in therapy but not specifically trauma counseling. \n\n I don't have the most healthy relationship with sex. I struggle to enjoy it, struggle to not dissociate, and even when I manage those things I feel incredible guilt and shame afterwards.\n\nI've been in a relationship for almost 8 years, married for 6. We are solid, very much in love and trust each other 1000%.

No amount of love and trust drowns out the voice in my head telling me to shut up and deal with things myself. So for a long time I just ignored my sexual problems, for a while tried to avoid sex as much as possible. That obviously didn't go well and my husband was frustrated, though gentle when communicating his frustration, and I promised to try harder to not say no ALL the time. \n\nWe invested in a hitatchi to help physically and that has been an improvement. I try to take a hot bath or have a drink before hand to help me relax. Sometimes these things help, but I'm still left feeling like I did something wrong after. \n\nI also get unreasonably irritated when being touched sexually outside of premeditated activity. But I KNOW I'm being unreasonable, with all of this. So I don't say anything. I know that's probably not healthy either but it's not HIS fault. \n\nI don't want to unload all this and make him feel like he's doing something wrong when I am the problem. \n\nI don't have a specific question, I guess I'm just looking for anyone who might have similar experience, or resources or whatever.

It ended with him making a Death threat and the Police (who didn't do anything for some reason...).\n\nSo all this because we had a previous renter live with us for more than a week WITHOUT me and my other Friendly Roommate (\"FR\" now) and my Shitty Roommate (\"SR\" now) who has made a Pigsty of our home (dishes for over 1 month left uncleaned in the counter...even got recently did of the garbage container, so we have no where to put our garbage...).\nAnyways that roommate, who ended up squatting next to my SR for over a week, when asked if it was normal to habe someone else in the house? Found the \"Squatter\" and a girl, in a Twin Bed...but the room came with only a single bed, so he somehow got 1 mattress out and another in, without SR noticing. There's a difference between the amount of money that SR said he received and what the \"Squatter\" said he gave. Both amounts are beyond ridiculously low and the lack of calling the Police is just more evidence that something not right went on, some kind of secret arrangement of some kind...\n\nAfter all, Squatter ended up leaving because he said it was too disgusting...to be clear, he was talking about SR's dirty dishes and using the common area for his own private business and leaving is stuck in a ton his work things, with no table and no counters available to prepare good, that's what a kitchen is supposed to be for...not even a place to sit is available.\n\nSR's behavior has also degraded greatly in the last few months...\nHaving multiple issues like Complex PTSD, Anxiety Disorders, and a Neurological Sleep Disorder. I've also obviously been through 11/12 Years of Narcissistic Abuse from my own Mother, and since I've \"escaped\" I still somehow always ended up with roommates that were either somewhat psychopathic, had Narcissistic Traits or were just full blown NPD...\nRight now I'm thinking Full Blown NPD, since the only other person he wanted on the real Lease is FR.\nBut I think that SR chose FR because he is mildly Autistic (Aspergers) and FR constantly feels pressured and is manipulated to take the fallout for SR's actions and behavior!\nFR is very often insulted and blasted for small mistakes and SR is just very condescending to FR, and very arrogant and self-entitled to pretty much every one else...\n\nAll this because SR Forced the Squatter guy on me and FR pretty much folded...he chose him because they both spoke the same language...\nAnd that's despite me warning him that I didn't feel good about it but in the end he Forced it. And I tokd him that since I didn't get a say in it that I should not be responsible for him...(turns out I was right to say that! He even made a surplus of 160$ in electricity for the few months he was here...).\n\nBy the way, you might say, maybe I am the problem...but why has there been at least 5 different roommates in a little more than a Year? And the maximum number of People (accepted) in the home was 4. So that makes a lot of people to move out in a short period of time...\n\nAnyways, anyone who cab help me with my anxiety or whatever would be really appreciated...in Can.\n\nI keep wanting to get away from Narcissist to Narcissist...\nI'd take my own place but I don't have the money for that until I get on Disability, right now, I'm on Social Assistance (which SR has threatened to call just give me some shit...because apparently, telling him that he can take me to Court and I'll be happy to resolve this...\n\n(SR seemed happy with the laughable sum that Squatter gave him not to call the Police, but he did not consult anyone else! He spent about 8 days if not more, illegally in our house, it was SR's choice to choose him and give him a set of keys which he did not ask back when he left, so it should be SR's responsibility to pay. Or if he tries his lies at Squatter to see if he can't make him shell out more money, to cover his mistake, then so be it but otherwise, no...\n\nAll I did is deduct what I paid when Squatter was living with us (legally, so we were 4) and deducted the amount I paid for May which was for 3 persons and the rather small amount being the difference between living with 4 roommates and living with 3 roommates...\n\nI took that number and deducted it from the rent. So SR should go and get his money, not from me, but from the person he should of gotten arrested in the first place! (\"Squatter\").\n\nAnd that's why the ridiculous amount he paid to SR and the incongruency between their numbers of dollars paid/received, Squatter leaving because SR's trash, SR not asking for the keys back, not calling the authorities, it all points to signs that a deal was struck between them, especially considering the bed exchange!

I\u2019m not sure where to turn from here. I don\u2019t know how I will ever trust again that people are who they say they are. \n\nMaybe a small backstory will help figure out why   I continually get involved with toxic people, maybe I need to turn somewhere else to get answers but I feel so alone. \nI grew up in an abusive household and my mother has BPD. My whole life I\u2019ve been told how worthless I am. In Highschool I became best friends with a narcissist who continuously told me we were destined to be together for 4 years until I finally gave in and gave him a shot. It was perfect for a short time and we made a rash decision to get married. It wasn\u2019t long before his true colors came out, but I had no idea what was even going on and he blamed it on his depression, so I understood coming from a family with various mental health issues. It took me 5 years of marriage to realize that my Nex was actually abusive and not just mentally unstable. That\u2019s when I met my bf now. He witnessed a lot of the abuse over the phone as I would turn to him when things got really dark and I was trying to find a way out of the relationship with Nex. He was kind, caring, supportive and listened whenever I needed to escape Nex. He also came from an abusive relationship and we tried to be each other\u2019s bandaids and it worked for a while. \n\nFast forward almost 3 years and life with him is chaos. It took me a while to realize that he had some anger issues similar to my Nex, which is something I told him upfront I could not be with someone who was that angry again and he promised me he wasn\u2019t when we first met. I don\u2019t know why I make people promises that I will never leave them no matter how tough things get. And maybe that\u2019s why they think nothing they do will be bad enough for me to leave. But here I am again, tangled in a psychological web. We have a baby together and his other child lives with us and calls me mommy. Which makes everything 10x more complicated. I don\u2019t even know if my bf is also narcissistic I don\u2019t know how to tell. It\u2019s so different but a lot of it feels the same. Things will be good for a while only when he has weed to smoke, but when he runs out things go downhill quickly. It starts off with him stating how irritated he is and starts pointing out little annoying things I do (which is something my Nex also did) then suddenly I say one wrong thing or something goes wrong in some way (that is completely oblivious to me because I\u2019m just trying to do whatever I can to avoid him getting angry) and then he\u2019s yelling about how much he hates his life and that I don\u2019t care about him and no one cares and that he should just kill himself and slit his throat. And I reassure him and try not to cry and then he doesn\u2019t want to be touched and he tells me I\u2019m stupid or tells me I cause everything and then I get a string of \u201cFuck you\u2019s\u201d thrown my way. This is exactly what Nex\u2019s anger looked like but the after effect is different. With Nex when he cooled down I would reassure him how stupid I am and that I can fix myself and we will work on it together and I would clean the whole house and pamper him which is exactly what he wanted because Nex used fear to control me. I got so used to it that I don\u2019t know how to stop. When I try to do these things with my bf after he blows up, it\u2019s completely wrong and stupid and \u201cWhy are you still doing these things? I\u2019m not your abusive ex husband.\u201d And then he apologizes and we talk and I tell him he promised he wouldn\u2019t be like this when our baby was born (it\u2019s been 10 months and surprise he never kept his promise) and he tells me how much of a piece of shit he is (something my Nex would never say about himself) and tells me he needs to fix everything and that there\u2019s something wrong with him. I try to pour my feelings on him and tell him I don\u2019t feel like I can come to him when I\u2019m upset anymore because he lashes out (he used to be the only person who could calm me down) but then he started getting angry when I would cry. My Nex also used to get angry about me crying and I told my bf way before we started actually talking that I wasn\u2019t allowed to cry and he said that was horrible, yet here I am, crying on the bathroom floor alone again. I can\u2019t have bad days anymore because he\u2019s too depressed and he says \u201cI\u2019m depressed and you are talking about the bad day you had. You are making it about yourself again. You don\u2019t even care that I want to die.\u201d But when I confront him about the fact that he does this, he just calls me ridiculous because \u201cOf course you are allowed to be upset and have bad days.\u201d If I fall asleep before him it\u2019s my fault and I ruined his night because \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be tired you didn\u2019t work all day. What did you even do today?\u201d (Even though being a stay at home mom is more than a full time job.) Nex would also blame me for being tired when I was the only one working and supporting us. He would snap his fingers in my face to keep me awake and tell me if I cared about him I would stay up with him. \n\nI feel trapped again. I feel worthless again. I don\u2019t want my child growing up in the same environment I did. I don\u2019t want them to see me like this. He told me that he was also abused, and I have met his ex because she is the mother to his other child (she is truly a horrible manipulative person) but I\u2019m wondering if the abuse wasn\u2019t one sided because he told me he acted this way with her as well. I don\u2019t know what to think anymore. I feel like this will be my life forever on and endless loop, stuck in a cycle I can never escape. I do still enjoy many things about him and we do have fun times together, but I also did with my Nex until I didn\u2019t anymore. I just can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s a narcissist because he knows something is wrong with him at times and he apologizes and owns up to admitting that he needs to fix things, though he never does. I know I won\u2019t get that answer here, and I\u2019m sorry this post is so long. Thank you to anyone who replies or even reads this. I had to get it off my chest because I\u2019ve been holding it in for so long.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm wondering if y'all want to give me another rundown. :)\n\nI am currently 'talking' to someone. We are not intimately involved (yet) ...as I want to go slow, learn this person, just try to grow something organic and healthy vs. jumping into some sexual addiction, attachment (which is sort of what happened with my nex in the very beginning).\n\nI'm asking about red flags because I'm starting to wonder if I am *paranoid* (aka: overly analyzing EVERYTHING) or if some things could absolutely be 'red flags' I should heed. \n\nFor example:\n\nHe is kind. Doesn't want to 'hurt' me or make me feel uncomfortable or feel like I'm doing anything to just say, \"yes\" to him. He wants me to speak my mind, be honest about how I feel if he says or does anything I'm not 100% okay with.\n\nHe does at times come off possessive. For example, he had me talk to a friend of his about setting up a website and learning how to apply for grants/business loans for this project he had in mind. He asked me to speak to the guy (over the phone) when they were hanging out. I obliged. It was a basic, business focused conversation. At the end, I told the guy if he had more questions just to ask my boyfriend (for a lack of a better term) to convey the question and I'll try to answer it. Later on that night, my boyfriend said 'I did right' because I didn't give the guy my contact information (email, phone #, etc.) but rather told him to go through my boyfriend for future contact. The way he said it kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I got real quiet on the phone. And we ended the call sooner than normal because he sensed something was off with me (but I didn't outright tell him). I was trying to process what he meant by it and how I took it and yeah, if it was a red flag or just an awkwardly worded comment?\n\nI sometimes feel too like I have to ALWAYS be positive and happy and yeah just the person he can count on to lift him up. But it frustrates me because I'm not *always* happy and peppy and super positive. Since letting him into my life, I do have a decent amount of times when I'm just drab or overwhelmed or just not in the mood to be anything but frustrated and stressed. He is aware of my past situation. He knows I have two kids and I work all the time. He knows my life is far from perfection and simplicity. Yet I think he's grown accustomed to that image of me since I tried so hard to always be happy, positive and upbeat around him. I know I should just explain that to him again -- tell him if he can't handle me when I'm simply not happy then what the hell, then you don't care or love or want to be with the 'real' me ... no one can always be super positive, happy!\n\nOkay ... sorry I ranted. Haha I'm just trying to feel out what signs or things I need to be looking at ... I'm just trying to take my time but not be swept up either. I'm interested in this guy but want to go slow. He's on board with the going slow and not rushing a damn thing but I also need to feel out what he expects his healthy and normal in terms of a relationship.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I asked if he could acknowledge and apologize for his role in me ending up where I am right now, and he actually apologized although it didn't sound 100\uff05 sincere.

(my mum recently bought me some products and she wanted me to use them everyday, so i did it before i forgot about it \\[cause i have adhd\\])  then my mum came into the bathroom, she wasn't yelling but she wasn't exactly nice about it,\n\n\"why haven't you eaten breakfast! go eat! take your medication!\"\n\ni only had 10 minutes left to get ready, so i went into my room to pack my backpack and go downstairs to eat. My dad came into my room and said \"hurry up! go eat!\". he started to get annoyed at me for being to slow, so he came into my room and kicked me on the butt. i fell to the ground and covered my face and started crying. he picked up my backpack a couple feet off the ground and dropped it in front of me, \"hurry up!!!!!!\".\n\nat this point my dad was yelling, and he didn't kick me super hard, but it hurt and scared me enough to fall on the ground and protect my face. i didn't move at all, i just stayed there crying until my mum came into my room, and she seemed pretty angry. she took everything out of my backpack, and started to repack it. i tried to take the bag away from her and put my stuff back into it. we ended up fighting over it, she grabbed my wrists with her hands and wouldn't let go, i pushed her away and tried to repack my bag. she kept grabbing my wrists to move me away, and i kept pushing her. it got pretty physical, i hit her a few times with my homework (which was like 2 sheets of paper) and she was yelling and crying, so was i.\n\n\"stop it!!!!!! just let me help you!!!! why am i the only one doing this?!?!?!?!?\"\n\nmy dad burst into my room and my mum said, \"grab her!.\" so my dad picked my up from my armpits and lifted me a few feet off the ground while my mum took my backpack. my dad dropped me onto the ground and i started bawling and coughing. it was hard to breathe at that point because i was crying so much. i got up, screamed at my mum and slammed the door and ran downstairs because i was so upset. my mum followed me and said that i was traumatizing my sisters, and that i'm ruining my relationship with them.\n\nwe ended up arguing more downstairs, but it was nothing physical. just verbal stuff, it was pretty hurtful to me. they threatened to send me to a foster home, or to my deadbeat dad's house because \"they can't take it anymore.\" my mum told me to stop crying multiple times, and said that the way that i treat them is unfair. \"I provide for you, drive you to dance, buy you medication and *this is how you TREAT US!*\"\n\nthe second i got to school i had a mental breakdown, but i'm scared to tell anyone about it. i dont want to make it sound like im abused if im actually not abused, i dont want my parents to get mad at me. i'm terrified to getting in trouble, absolutely terrified. my mum compares me to my friends and my dad, even though it upsets me a lot for her to say that i'm like my deadbeat dad. i told her to stop, but she still sometimes does it, and she justifies it to. she'll say something like, \"oh you are just like him. you play the victim.\" i tell her to stop and she says, \"well then maybe don't treat me like this and i won't compare you to him.\" my dad was emotionally abusive towards my mum, but i was to young to remember any of it.\n\nphysical altercations have happened before, my parents tried to take away my laptop once. i had it in my arms and my dad picked me up and my mum ripped it out of my hands, and i was dropped on the ground (only a few feet though.) i've been slapped across the face, pushed down the stairs, i've had my face grabbed and my mum yell at me and tell me that im ugly and pull at my hair. the time i was pushed down the stairs, i cut my own bangs. my parents were really mad. my mum tried to get me to go downstairs but i was resisting. she pushed me a little and i fell onto the first step, and curled up into a ball to protect myself (i guess it's a coping mechanism, but i don't know why i do it.) she yelled at me, so i went down stairs. thats when she grabbed my face, and told me i was ugly because of the bangs, and pulled on them. it hurt, but when i told them why i was upset, they said i was exaggerating. so i guess i'm just playing the victim and trying to make them look bad.\n\ni'm weird and out of control, and can't function properly as a human being without medication. i'm a terrible person and i'm just like my dad and i deserve to die. everything is my fault. this is how i feel a lot of the time, especially when i'm at home or just had an argument of some kind. my parents tell me that stuff, that i'm weird, not normal and stuff, so it must be true. i doubt it's actually abuse, i'm probably just making stuff up for attention. i don't even know why i bothered to post this, but i need help.

I just started casually dating, going for coffee etc with other people. Well, Last night My son (4 years old) fell asleep on the couch, my daughter (3 years old) decided to sleep in my bed and my baby (11 months old) was sleeping in his crib (all kids are his). I took a shower at around midnight. While I was in the shower I felt this overwhelming dread. Like I was being watched. I swore I saw my ex staring at me with the most cold and frightening stare at the edge of the shower curtain. I waited a few minutes and looked out and no one was there. I quickly got into my pajamas and went to bed. I woke up and my son was in his bed, somehow dried blood on his face from a nose bleed (he has nose bleeds once in a while due to the weather being hot) and a few things were moved around.\n\nI tried to tell myself maybe the kids moved a few things? Maybe my son moved to his bed on his own? So I asked him straight up, \"how did you get to bed last night? Did you go there yourself or did someone move you?\" He told me \"Someone moved me\" I asked \"do you know who?\" he looked at me and said \"Nana or Daddy\". I said \"Do you know for sure if it was Daddy or Nana?\" He thought about it and he said \"Maybe Daddy\".\n\nI looked on the couch, no blood. I looked on his bed, no blood. I asked my mom if she moved him and she told me no cause I said to just let him sleep there so he was closer to me like he wanted. So I told my son \"If you see him come and get me, if you know its him you need to tell me right away\" \n\nI contacted police and informed them that I think he may have broken into my house while I was sleeping (There's a Protective Order right now). I'm not 100% sure, but I think he was. I Want to tell myself I'm just afraid and being paranoid but at the same time my intuition TOLD me something wasn't right. I ignored it and tried telling myself I'm crazy... Am I though? I don't know, maybe? I want to pretend I am but I want me and the kids to be safe. I know I locked the doors last night. I know the windows have the locks on them so they cant be opened all the way, but I never got the chance to check all the doors. Since my son was in the living room maybe he let him in the back door? I'm not sure, but I have had to have a talk with him about not letting him in the house as he doesn't live here anymore. How should I go about explaining it to my 4 year old son (he will be 5 in October). I don't want to frighten him.\n\nAlso, Am I crazy? Am I imagining this? Is this just my fear being stupid?

I am really confused and hurt right now so I might just burst everything out.\n\n\nWell, anyway, here's what I want to share. I have had a complicated relationship with this Narc several years ago. I actually came to realise he was a narc just recently.\n\nBasically, it was just sex as he was/is married, but back in the day I was so desperate that I was stupid enough to stay in this position and also so needy of attention enough to actually fall in love with him even though I knew he would never be available for me. \n\nAs it always does, it ended badly for me: out of a sudden, he asked to cut contact, even though things were actually starting to feel as if they got serious between us. Which is crazy, I know - he being with someone else and stuff, but in my mind I actually just thought I would take anything I could get. We travelled together and it was wonderful, and when we got back he suddenly \"broke up\" with me, claiming he was falling in love and it was too dangerous. He also asked me to delete his number, pictures and anything else I had from him and promised to do the same, which I did. I felt very used, but... Okay. It was harsh. I survived. This has been 5 years ago.\n\nAfter this, he came back out of the blue as if nothing happened. Out of the blue he texted me. No making amends, no apologies, actually, not even a true feeling that he knew me at all (but, of course, thousands of pictures of himself in the most varied positions at the gym). Still, as back then I did like him very much, I was very happy about it, but of course cautious, due to everything that had happened. He immediately wanted to see me but I needed more time. Somehow, to tell the truth, I was expecting something like \"I'm sorry\", \"I know what I said, but missed you\" kinda thing. Needless to say this not only never happened, but all he wanted was to remain in the superficiality, while insisting to meet me. When I told him why I wouldn't (because I needed time and because it felt strange that he never even apologised), his answer was to send me an upper body picture of his. I felt that this was somehow strange so I let contact gently fade.\n\nOkay. So far, actually so good, right?\n\nFor some stupid reason, I have all this time been thinking that, somehow, it was bad of me to just not answer anymore, so a couple of days ago I have texted him (a looong text) the reasons why I had not kept in touch and apologised for doing so and also explaining that everything has been too overwhelming for me, due to the fact that I have ever felt like he had a way bigger importance for me than the contrary (which is obvious). We restarted texting and, again, he started insisting to meet up, while sending pictures (of his face. His body. His muscles. Him holding a weight at the gym. You name it). Honestly, I wasn't even expecting an answer to my long text, I was just looking for some decent closure and moving on, but somehow that's not how it went (or perhaps I was looking to fall into the trap again?). Anyways. Two days later, he sent me a huge text which did not have anything to do with the one I had sent, but was full of critics about me and references to things that, well, weren't me (places where we supposedly met (never happened), things I would have worn (never had anything on the mentioned colour in my life) and so on (one could almost say he was confusing me with someone else, but still, I didn't take offence in that as it could just be a blur in his memories. And he went on on criticizing me. How I was too emotional, how I hadn't offered him emotional security (regardless of the fact that he was in a relationship and still is). Honestly, I found it somewhat inappropriate because it didn't really talk of anything good, and also because we never had a relationship (so why would we need to have the relationship talk?). But anyhow, being the silly thing that  am, I thought that I would be being unpleasant if I actually said that or even tried to explain anything about my behaviour so I just thanked him for the text, said that I didn't know exactly what to say because I didn't want to create an argument and that is it. We didn't talk anymore. and I thought that was it, case closed, all good, I have explained myself and can move on. Or so I thought. The day before yesterday, he texted me saying that I never answered him (which I had) and that he was still expecting an answer. I explained that I did answer and quoted my answer once again. What followed that is the craziest rollercoaster of emotional abuse I have ever seen.\n\nFirst, he was sarcastic about me saying that I had answer, and said that I didn't even point out to anything on his text. I explained why I didn't and explained that I felt that a few things were not really necessary. He then started sending me text after text, one crazier than the other - and I mean it: one text was \"I love you, always have and always will\", then the next was calling me egoistic and self centered, then after that saying that had always been the woman of his dreams, then the next one saying that \"yet another reason why I didn't want to be with you is because you were not exclusive to me\"(which I was silly enough to actually be back then). Then next text saying that we should start over. After that: Picture of himself, requesting me to send me a picture of myself so he can see how good I look now. While I,caught in that thoughtless moment of receiving one accusation after the other, desperately tried to explain myself in each message (and please believe me, after all I have told you guys here, I have no reason to lie: I have been respectful with all my answers, and calm, and not aggressive), he went on on full abuse, saying that I just wanted to play the victim. and finishing with \"Fuck off, bitch, please disappear from my life\". That was literally two messages after one that had a heart emoji and said \"will love you forever\".\n\nI know what you are thinking: PHEW. It seems, and I agree, that I got rid of him and should actually be relieved - because as it turns out I have realized while writing this post that it would probably even be dangerous to meet him, by the looks of the messages. Still, I must say: no one has called me a bitch before, and nobody felt entitled enough to harass me and then attack me by saying I should vanish from their life. I didn't even get the chance to defend myself. And I know it'y crazy, and I know that you might think like I had it coming, but let me be honest once again: I am shocked and very hurt to know that someone felt entitled to treat me like that in such a narcissistic way (I am still pretty shocked about the mixture between aggressions and pictures of himself within seconds). And that is why I thought I would share this story with you guys here. I would really, really use a hug right now. And I hope you don't judge me for that, or all that.

I didn't want him to hit my little brothers, so I always stepped in and took the beating or re-directed it onto a object or something that wasn't living. This went on for as long as I can remember.

Meanwhile, he\u2019s showing you his *true self* when he claims he can\u2019t be *himself.*\n\nThis does a few things for him:\n\n1. **His bad action=your fault.** By stating he can\u2019t be himself around you, he is setting up excuses for future poor behavior. He can either point this out, or just plant it in your mind, so that you begin to subconsciously see this as an excuse for poor behavior. If he doesn\u2019t commit or show you affection at times, it\u2019s because *you* don\u2019t let him be himself. Anything he does that you don\u2019t like is just him *reacting to you* not letting him be himself.\n2. **You\u2019re always wrong**. He repeats that he can\u2019t be himself around you to set you up for believing you\u2019re always doing something wrong. You don\u2019t know what it is, or how you are doing it, and no matter what your gut says, you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s a statement you can\u2019t refute, because if he says he can\u2019t be himself, can you prove otherwise? You should assume you\u2019re wrong *always*. You should never trust your gut. This only leaves one option: you should just trust him when he tells you anything.\n3. **It\u2019s okay for him to look somewhere else.** He\u2019s getting you to question whether it\u2019s okay for him to seek out other options to make up for what you lack. If he can\u2019t be himself with you, shouldn\u2019t he try to be himself somewhere? He\u2019s telling you he can\u2019t be himself *with you,* which implies he *can be* when *not with you*. This guilt trip can be used to weaken your resolve through conditioning. You want him to be himself. He can\u2019t be himself around you. Therefore, maybe it isn\u2019t so bad that he\u2019s finding other people to be himself around.\n4. **Prove you can be worthy.** Clearly you don\u2019t do what you need to do for him\u2026because he can\u2019t be himself around you. Prove him wrong. Try as hard as you can, bending over backward to show him you are worth his time and effort. You have to work hard though. He wants to be himself around you, but you haven\u2019t been letting it happen. -He\u2019s setting you up to play catch up. You aren\u2019t on equal footing in his eyes, which means you have to try harder to keep him, even if he\u2019s behaving poorly.\n\nIt\u2019s all manipulation, all lies, and it may not even really be a conscious act.\"\n\nDon't fall for this trap and don't doubt yourself.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have very little from my time with him.\n\nI was in a relationship with someone from about age 16/\\~19ish. Late high school. He was only six months older than me but constantly dangled that over my head, insisting that I didn't understand or that he had more experience than me.\n\nHe isolated me from my friends, and started whispering that maybe they were bad friends, maybe they were crazy for saying that he was a bad person. He drove away my parents too. I still don't know who to believe.\n\nHe'd guilt trip me into always going to visit him, because he was allergic to my cat. He lived 20 minutes away by car, so my parents would have to drive me. He had his own car, but why would he drive, only to go back? That was a 40 minute trip for him!! It was a 40 minute trip for my parents, too.\n\nWe went to a concert one time. I had to ask him to come with me when his mum was in the room, otherwise he wouldn't have gone. She made him. We had a really nice time. I loved it- it was Gustav Holst's The Planets, performed live. The theater was basically empty. I was motioning along and humming. I played some of the songs in band myself. There was no one around for at least 10 seats in any direction. I wasn't even being loud- I bet he was the only person who could hear me. When we went and got dinner afterwards he berated me for being disruptive and making him look like an idiot. The whole memory leaves a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nThe first time we had sex I didn't actually want to. He had been pressuring me on and off for months, \"why not? why not?\" I just never wanted to. It never interested me. I didn't want to do anything like that. Even typing this out I feel so weird and disgusted with myself. I told my parents and my dad wouldn't let me stay the night with him anymore. I just remember him screaming \"I don't want you to have sex with him!\" It was a year later I realized his sister also went through this abuse. \n\nWe never did anything I wanted to do. It was always what he wanted. \"You should play League. You should play Dark Souls.\" I didn't really like League, I don't like multiplayer gamed. I liked Dark Souls though. He held my hand through the whole experience. I didn't try again until years after.\n\nI remember sitting at the dinner table with my parents retelling a story he'd told me about some guy cheating on his wife on 4chan. I kept trying to explain how it was a good story. My parents just looked at me horrified. I didn't understand.\n\nMy friends ended up abandoning me. My sister and my parents were alienated, especially after I moved out for college. I don't blame my friends though. I wasn't a good friend at the time. It's not their fault they couldn't deal with me.\n\nWe went to a restaurant once. I don't come from a country where tipping is normal. He literally hid the tip on the table. He hid it, under a napkin. I let the waitress know that it was for her, and not something we'd left by accident. Outside he berated me for telling her like it was supposed to be a secret. He berated my parents for not raising me right.\n\nTwo years after breaking up (NC) he sends me a message on facebook in dutch asking me if I'm alright. He does not speak dutch. I ignore him. He presses. Turns out he had \"received a phonecall from me claiming I had been kidnapped, and after all these years he was still ready to be a white knight for me\". His exact words, they're seared into my head. He said he had received the phoney phonecall four days prior. If I really was being kidnapped I would have been gone by then.\n\nI tell these stories like they are memories. I also have short ones of him writing songs for me, him running outside in the pouring rain and washing his hair while his mum and I were laughing.\n\nI just feel so conflicted. It's been 6 years and the thought of him still makes me scared. Every time I eat something and audibly enjoy it (saying Mmm! and Oh my god yum! etc) I feel guilty and like I'm embarrassing the person I'm with. It took almost three years for me to start singing to myself again. Music is my everything.\n\nWhy can't I let him go? Why can I say all these things and think, maybe it wasn't so bad?

Desperately need some help.", "author": "Violet_Galaxy", "self_text": "This is long as fuck, I'm so sorry. Okay so this has been destroying me. I grew up in a very abusive household with a narcissistic mother, and have been abused for my entire conscious life. The one thing I've promised myself is to never inflict the pain I've received onto other people, and I have honestly been successful with that. So this is where it gets really weird:\n\nMy relationship with my girlfriend has not been the best for our 4 years together. Just so you know, she has severe depression and anxiety. Just a year in is when her abuse began. She will have melt downs at me, scream at me, self harm and blame me for it, threaten suicide, tell me if I loved her I'd \"insert whatever she wants from me\", asks for alone time then avoids me for weeks before getting mad at me for not reading her mind and reaching out to her. There's been so much that it's hard to keep track of at this point. The thing that really hurts out of all of that is this strange thing she does that I don't have a word for: At least weekly she does this thing where she... fuck I can't even explain it. Here's a quick example: Out of nowhere I'll receive something in a message like \"My job is to fuck you and make you happy\". This is super confusing because I'm absolutely terrified of being in a position of power. I don't pressure her, or make out anything to be her job. It feels like a strange attack of assuming my thoughts and forcing them onto me.. kind of villain-izing me? I can't explain it but it feels worse than anything else.\n\nI can't communicate with her regardless of how hard I try. I study communication tactics and am calm, yet as soon as I bring up anything that has hurt me, regardless of if she was involved or not, she'll start either hysterically crying or will actually get MAD at me. I have learned to hide any emotions other than happiness from her at this point because whenever I get sad about even life things, she will get mad at me and then tell me later she got mad because \"Nothing I was doing was helping and I felt like you were just trying to make me feel bad\". Her version of comfort is to ask me what I want and give up 4 seconds later before getting mad! I seriously don't get this!\n\nAnd then after all these sorts of things, she'll make me a craft gift and be so lovely and happy to me. I'm stuck in this strange cycle where I'm feeling so anxious and lonely all the time, and when she decides to be happy and nice it lifts me up so much. I feel so stuck and I have no idea what to do.\n\nBut back to the title: I have been dealing with this pretty much weekly for years, so it's become routine to me and this anxious feeling is almost default. But something broke me yesterday - she called me abusive, and didn't do what she usually does. Usually she would say something really mean, then apologize within an hour. But this time she doubled down, and now suddenly everything has shifted over to me. Suddenly to her I have all these abusive issues, and she can't stand it any longer. This is so confusing to me, as throughout this relationship I have been kind loving and accommodating. Whenever she has had an issue with me I work on it as hard as I can, just as an example during the end of the first year I had problems with anger. She told me that the anger was making her uncomfortable, and from that day forward I have never been angry at her or around her. I learned a lot about communication during that time. I know this is coming from a person accused of being abusive, but I beg you to believe me. I have loved her with all my heart, and whenever I inevitably hurt her during the relationship I have profusely apologized and have worked to never do it again.\n\nBut so yeah, these couple of weeks have been very different and very strange. It's the longest she has avoided me - telling me she wants to be alone. So I give her the space she needs, and keep myself busy in the meantime. By this point I should mention, I am the only one who makes plans in this relationship, and 95% of the time she will cancel on me last minute after I'm ready for her. So after being constantly rejected and cancelled on, being in a deadbedroom situation, and being treated as she treats me - I've started standing up for myself.\n\nBut this seems to be a massive fucking mistake, as it's giving her heaps of ammo to use against me. After I found out that during her wanting to be alone and avoiding me for weeks, she had been making plans with friends and making new friends online.. man that hurt. And no I didn't get angry or lash out, I calmly asked what was going on, and why would she lie to me about wanting to be alone, but doing all these things while not talking to me for weeks? She became hysterical, then calmed down and saw my point of view, being nice and reassuring me that she wasn't avoiding me. But of course this was now added to her arsenal to use against me, as this worry of mine has made me into a person \"that doesn't allow her to have friends, emotionally blackmails her isolates her to me\". However the worst part in my mind is how I'm not allowed to make mistakes. I'm usually as quiet as I can be around her, but only recently with all this avoidance and anger, I've made a comment like \"It feels like I'm hugging a stranger\", or \"I feel like I don't know you anymore\". This is honestly how it's felt in the moment. But yeah, if I make a mistake and say anything like this, she'll use it against me forever regardless of if I apologize or not.\n\nPlus something so strange is that I feel like I've slowly been conditioned and backed into a corner. Due to her reactions to me bringing up a problem, I've learned to guess what her reaction would be and tailor a prefaced sentence for her. A quick example would be something like me bringing up an issue within the relationship, and without a preface she would then say something like \"I knew you never loved me\" or \"Just break up with me then, I know you hate me\". So I've learned to begin any issue talks with \"I'm not breaking up with you\" or something around those lines. But recently it was the big issue with avoidance. Without a preface I wanted to say \"I can't deal with this avoidance anymore, what is going on? I am so confused\", but of course I know she would assume the whole \"i can't deal with this\" as an ultimatum and would go into hysterics, so I began it with \"This isn't an ultimatum but I can't deal with this avoidance etc\". So now after being conditioned to preface things for her, she's now using it against me as me being emotionally manipulative. I feel like I can't do anything right and I have no idea what to do anymore.\n\nLastly in the recent abuse accusation is how I'm abusive for \"putting all the pressure on her to change her behavior to suit me\". You probably already know by now but whenever there has been an issue, I calmly begin to talk about it before she's in hysterics - and then suddenly I'm comforting her even though I was there trying to talk about how she hurt me. So me bringing up any issues about her abusive behavior and neglect towards me is apparently me trying to change her behaviour to suit me. You know what? In that case I AM trying to \"change your behaviour to suit me\" because I don't deserve abuse.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I'm not here saying that I am perfect at all. I have made mistakes as I mentioned earlier. Like during this period of avoidance I have had moments where I'll look for reassurance about one of her new friends - like if they are hitting on her, or if they seem like a good dude. Anytime I've been insecure like this in the past (very rarely), she's understood since I have been cheated on before. But at this point it almost seems like me looking for any sort of reassurance (such as it feeling like she's avoiding me), or being sad at all - is all in her mind me manipulating her. It's part of the reason why I'm so scared to be sad around her these days.\n\nThis is all kinds of fucked up. But yeah, I've been abused all my life and have a lot of experience with being gaslighted. I feel like she may be projecting and shifting the \"blame\" to me with any mistake she can grab at... but still, the accusation has broken me. I can't do anything without thinking about how she says I'm abusive. I've changed so much for her, and it's suddenly like I've done nothing. I feel stuck in this cycle of being abused, avoided, and then suddenly she's happy, kind, apologetic for her behaviour and reassuring/comforting to me. Every cycle I have been able to forget and forgive everything in order to have more happy moments with her, but after being labelled as an abuser and a \"person who makes her feel like shit\", I am struggling at the idea of even seeing her. And the worst part is that the potential gaslighting is working on me. I'm constantly doubting myself now and am starting to have thoughts that maybe I am the problem and that she's right. It's freaking me out because I can be snarky at times, but I have always tried so hard to be good for her.\n\n**tldr;** a tldr for all this is difficult..

Skipping to around 8 years old, one night my Mom comes into my room drunk and tells us we were adopted and not like other kids (that fucking crushed me and still does to this day), and I cried silently afterwards when she left. My life was rough after that, but what I didn't know until this year was my sister had it worse than me, her expectations were higher, harsher, much more stressful, and she couldn't cope with it all eventually and experimented with drugs and alcohol and went to parties to try to relieve stress. Meanwhile I was alone, self conscious, shy, always had bad grades, and over all just not a confident person. I thought of myself as less than human for being alive and living in my Mom's house. \n\n     My sister felt like Mom just hated her guts (she had a horrible childhood with her younger sister, and my sister is right about how terribly Mom treated my twin). She, got into a lot of shit over our four years in highschool ( to deal with the stress) and I'm glad she told me now, but at the same time I wish we could've talked about at least some of it, maybe all of it could have been avoided. I'm not a good person either, as in I'm too scared of my parents to help my sister. I would get bullied at school a lot but I took weight training class and that all stopped soon after that.     \n\n     I was just lonely even with friends and what's left of my family( thinking about it my Mom might be self destructive with her drinking, her cutting off ties to family from my stepdad's side, sending the whole police department over for my stepmom, etc.). Even when I finally made some real friends in highschool (about 4), deep down I feel that I probably didn't deserve them for being adopted and being a failure at life (I think I might be depressed but not sure either, cuz I did try to hang myself a couple of times. I don't think I deserve happiness). I don't think there's something right with my head and mindset, and I truly believe that, but I also try to stay positive and keep a kind and quiet act up(my self defense against my parents and their yelling and belittling directed at me). It's hard though, me and my twin are 19, but I feel like she's definitely gone through a lot more shit than I would ever just based on our different perspectives in life. \n I also can't compare, we may be the same blood but we are two separate individuals.

I knew EVERYTHING about what my father and mother had been saying to each other, either from them themselves or from being shown solicitors letters on the build up to said divorce. \n\nWhere my father was usually quite silent and would only kick off if my mother had picked a fight, (don\u2019t get me wrong they were both as bad as each other) - it would mostly be my mother that would tell me things. Like what he\u2019d said or how he doesn\u2019t pay enough child support for my sister and I, how he would rather go on holidays rather than see his children and just an overall topic about how he didn\u2019t want to be a father to us - which is true - he would pick and choose and he still does to this day. \n\nThis was my childhood. \n\nMy father inevitably met someone, the introduction was all done very poorly where he sprung her on my sister and I without warning which made me angry and essentially made me shut down to any form of conversation - purely for the fact that I didn\u2019t like that this had happened to my sister. I could handle this, I was around 11 at the time and felt very protective. \n\nThey got married. I didn\u2019t go to the wedding. I now have two half siblings. I enjoy seeing them -  none of this is their fault. They\u2019re still kids. \n\nMy mother had custody of us, my father would have us every second weekend. I would hate visiting his house and this was when my anxiety began. I hated leaving my home and visiting someone I\u2019d been told, \u201cdoesn\u2019t really want anything to do with us\u201d - I would freak out, the anxiety attacks were horrendous. \n\nThis increased after my father sent my sister home in his girlfriends underwear. \n\nWhen I came home after the weekends my mother would always question us about the events that happened. \u201cIs he seeing anyone\u201d \u201cwhat happened\u201d. As a child I felt she only wanted to hear the bad things that happened. So that was all I told her. \n\nMy mother would continue to almost favour my younger sister, which I\u2019m sure at some point we\u2019ve all felt sibling favouritism, this was different. I spent all of my teens being called an \u201cidiot\u201d or \u201cdense\u201d or \u201cfat\u201d just any word that was designed to hurt me. Whereas my sister didn\u2019t get any of these insults. \n\nThis went on til I was around 16/17, my mother found a partner who would eventually begin to hit me and bruise vital pressure points on my body. He took my pet cat and drove him miles away from me purely because he was my cat and he wanted to hurt me. \n\nAfter moving around after that boyfriend went, I decided that the only way to get out of this would be to find a boyfriend myself - which I did - and we spent 7 years together. I am 24 now and called off the whole relationship and wedding last year. His parents spoke to me horrendously and was just an extension of my childhood. I felt enough was enough and left him. He never paid any form of bill and didn\u2019t contribute. \n\nDealing with this breakup I went to my dad - he told me to take my antidepressants and a bottle of vodka - \u201cif that was what I wanted to do\u201d. \n\nAt this point my mother lives in England with a new partner. She isn\u2019t close to me. \n\nA few months later I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to be rushed in for emergency surgery. Terrifying in itself this was the first time my mother and father had been \u201creunited\u201d if you will. \n\nLong story short my father had phoned my mother to lie and say that \u201cit wasn\u2019t cancer\u201d - they couldn\u2019t be around each other after that and I was left. My mother lived with me after I was released from hospital and it was hell. She had put my dogs away to\nKennels without consulting me and continued to insult me for the duration of her stay. \n\nShe left and both sides of the family automatically thought that I\u2019d revert back to the person I was.

She, like me, was nicely turned out with her make up on and her trendy-but-age-appropriate outfit. You would never suspect us of being broken unless you looked closely into our eyes. We sat for a second in silence and then she said, \"Cute shoes!\" And I said \"Thanks. They are fun!\" Just a moment of normalcy that took the edge off for both of us. God bless her.\n\nI blubbered the entire way through the list. That ugly cry. At two points I looked up and my therapist was blubbering right along with me. \n\nHer reaction when I had finished... \"I wish you had told me all of this sooner (I just started therapy 3 months ago).

I  would sometimes find myself in a place of feeling I couldn't trust him or was confused by him.  I didn't automatically jump to conclusions and would address it with him seeking understanding.  He was always patient and understanding and so this gave me a feeling that I could trust again.  Sometimes his explanations made sense, other times they didn't or confused me more.  But overall, his tone toward it I think is what made me feel like I was in a safe situation again.  I brought up a confusion/concern maybe once a week, in a reasonable way I think.  I mean, after all, I was still trying to get to know him as well.\n\nThen one night, I brought up a new confusion/issue....and for the first time I sensed a passive aggressiveness, he referred to my concern as \"your little list\".  While I understand if I was causing issues and he was frustrated, it was at least the first time he expressed frustration/passive aggressiveness (are they the same thing?)\n\nLong story, but I eventually decided to cut things off...he had been busy and we weren't able to talk yet, but he asked me through text about us going to two different places, and i answered honestly that I couldn't go anymore.  This was also the first night we could talk, so he called me shortly after this.  He seemed frustrated (an unusual expression of his)...and I referred to a sense I had that he was frustrated with me when he said \"your little list\"...i wasn't bringing it up because I was offended, but rather to understand what he was feeling...and that if he was frustrated with me that it was ok....like, maybe *he* had a concern about us.  But straightaway he replied with another passive aggressive remark, \"oh, that made the cut?  That's cute\".  Again, this passive aggressiveness felt *very* different than his previous dealings with me (and yet confirmed an intuition I had)....this sort of uber-patient/understanding soul.  I would understand if I was causing problems, but I simply wanted to know.  Eventually I had gotten to the point that I felt a large disparity in our communication styles, and he got more and more the sense that I was ending things.  It was here that he said, \"well, maybe we aren't compatible.  I'm tired of having to explain myself.\"  This didn't offend me, but it was the very first time he had expressed it....despite the fact that I've always been encouraging of honesty and transparency.  But his tone in this conversation was very hardened and I sensed an anger that I wasn't used to (in concrete terms).\n\nI feel like this conversation only solidified the confusions and concerns about manipulation from the very beginning.  But I never tried to accuse all that time, just talk about things....and his comforting/understanding would seem to always kind of erase my feelings.  He'd always say I could share anything I wanted.  I expressed the same to him, but he was noticeably more guarded.\n\nSo when I fully was clear that we needed to end things, I expressed that it was because of my confusions, a core disparity I felt in that he used communication differently than myself, a sense that he was just people pleasing a lot with me, and not asserting his true feelings.  This quality made him seem confusing and shifty and unknowable....like I didn't really see him clearly.  There was a list of things he said over our dating experience which were mildly hurtful/confusing/suspect as well, but I tried here to sort of summarize the core difference.\n\nIt was strange, and somehow confirmatory, that he suddenly dropped the hardened/passive aggressive tone and was now sort of pleading with me to try and grow in the area I addressed.  But his pleading felt uncomfortable to me....the core issue felt too big of an issue to me, for one....but I also didn't feel comfortable with someone proposing they would change a core aspect of their personality for me.  He even agreed with me that he had the issue I addressed.  He seemed almost desperate now, and even tried convincing me through saying things like relationships are work, that I am expecting perfection, etc.  He denied that either remark was passive aggressive, he described it as being \"sassy\" and even implied it to be acceptable as a part of gay culture.\n\nAs I've thought back on the break up, I focus on how I don't have that confused feeling with my closest friends, or even my few past dating experiences.  I'm not sure that I naturally distrust, though I know I can go there probably more than is normal.  I try and think of my friends and how they'd react to my bringing up issues (which I don't, because there aren't any) and I can sense they may get frustrated after a certain point, but I don't think I'd have a feeling that they'd flip into a hardened state, communicating this feeling of *I am displeased with you*.\n\nI react very negatively to passive aggressiveness, and those closest to me don't use it, just naturally.  I want someone to just say what they feel. If they're frustrated with me (which they never are that I'm aware of) their tone would probably be one of frustration+I still love you.\n\nI can't help but feel his sudden passive aggressiveness was indicative of a problem I long suspected...of a sort of covert, maybe even unintentional manipulation....or a unintentional need for control.  Its not difficult to imagine that he was just trying to control the situation in the end, albeit more visibly.  But maybe I'm reading too far into this.  Is there ever a time where passive aggressiveness is acceptable or not reflective of something unhealthy?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Back story.  Together 15 years 2 kids and a business.  This is in regards to our business.  For the last few years he has always singled out a female employee and they have become his supply.   I didn't know what it really was until I found this sub.  He would then devalue me and triangulate me with them.\n\nHis latest assistant, a 22 year old has been working for us for about 1.5 years.  Lots of drama and shity behaviour for the whole time she worked for us.  She wrecked his car a year ago, did she get fired, nope.  6 months ago she got a speeding ticket going 96mph in a company vehical, fired yet? guess again.  Driving privaliges revoked, nope.  He needs her to run errands for him.  Move her into another position where she doesn't drive and he hires a new assistant, you would have thought I was talking about drowning puppies and kittens by his reaction to that suggestion.\n\nBeer and Cider are available where we work.  Two nights ago she got off work and had friends come down and they all drank together.  I don't know how much she had, but when she was done she left in the company car and made it half a block and slammed in to a parked car.  She was arrested for DUII and reckless driving.  The car is totalled.\n\nOnce I found out I asked my husband to please not bail her out and that I don't want her to work for us anymore.  At first he agreed, but my spiddy scence were going off all day.  Speaking later in the day I asked if he had fired her yet.  I got a big argument about how he needed her to work an event this weekend, and he wasn't going to turn his back on her in her time of need.\n\n\nEXCUSE ME, WHAT?  \n\nI also found out through the grape vine that he posted her bail money.  I confronted him about it and he said she was released with out bail. He then attacked me and told me what a shitty person I was being for just dropping her and not supporting her while she is going through this, and that it is proof of what a cold hearted person I am.  Again:\n\nEXCUSE ME, WHAT?\n\nI don't buy it for one moment that she was released with out bail and will be double checking today.  If he paid it, it was in cash.  He hasn't made a cash deposit from the business in 3 weeks.  That is my money too.  I am 50% owner of the business.  \n\nUPDATE: She was released with out bail.  I guess the jail was overfull.\n\nComing out of the FOG is hard.  The reality is that 4 months ago I would have listened to him and would have internalized that I was a bad person for not being supportive of her.  Then I would have tried to be good with it all and ignore the ringing bells, red flags, and the open pit in my stomach just so he wouldn't think I was mean and didn't care about people.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We fought and discussed like normal couples do but one thing our friends always said is that, \"You guys fight but you always seem to work it out.\" We were also one of the few stable gay relationships among our friends and for many of our gay friends we were \"the goal/dream\" couple. This however, turned out to be a facade on my ex.\n\nMy ex is very good at keeping up appearances in the public eye but the moment we're alone he changes. In public he's sweet, kind, and lovable; a quintessential teddy bear. And for the most part of the four years he was. Then about a eight months to a year ago he started to change.\n\nHe had always been a little snarky and, being an only child, kinda stubborn when he wanted to do things his way. Then he started to be snappy and mean all the time, passing it off as \"Well that's just how I am, get used to it.\" He would punish me and my roommate if we out voted him on something by saying snide remarks, storming off, being petty around the apartment. It got so bad our roommate and closest friend considered moving out.\n\nHe started dominating things like how the apartment looked, saying he was the only one with a good design eye. He rolled his eyes at my music choices saying they sounded like shit and couldn't even sing. When we offered him the TV after we had been playing on it he'd clapback with \"Oh so now I get the TV?\" or \"Now why would I want to watch anything, no you keep playing your games!\" Things like that became common place and it was like walking in egg shells.\n\nOn the rare occasion if he got mad enough he'd punch me in the arm, gut, chest, or smack my face. And if I tried to defend myself or if he got in my face and I'd slap him he'd say I made him hit me. He'd also grab a shake me to try and shut me up.\n\nHe also held me to a double standard. For example he would get mad when I interrupted him yet was quick to interrupt me but then call me an asshole or childish for asking him not to interrupt me.\n\nThe thing that kills me and many of our friends is that he was never this bad. He's since moved out, told everyone he did the breaking up with and he doesn't care how he looks because \"(he's) finally doing something for (himself)\". He's restricted my access to our dog. Taken small items around the house to be petty. Laughed at my when I told him how hurt I felt. And so on.\n\nAnd the breakup came out of nowhere. We had actually been on the upswing but then in literally a day he went from \"I love you\" to \"I don't love you anymore\". I just feel so gross, used, and tossed aside. Like the four years meant nothing to him. Like all I did and sacrificed for him went unappreciated and dismissed.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I was always like \"WTF are you talking about?\" and she would respond with a gentle smile and her finger over her mouth and whisper \"shhhhhhhhhh\".

Only one who is free of shame can embrace their own self to the fullest and equally the self of the other. Unconditional love is therefore the end result and never the starting point (despite it being woven into the starting point) and it evolves with each step towards the freedom from shame we experience within ourselves first and then our significant other\" - My Narc went to unconditional love immediately but my experience was the exact opposite. I think she was so into our relationship so fast because she loved how it felt to suddenly have no shame and have it replaced with pride. She was beaming after she met me. And then to watch her pride slowly being replaced with her internal shame was like a slow death for me. I didn't know where her shame was coming from and she would somehow deflect it and put it on me like I was responsible for it. I didn't know what was was happening and it lead to my confusion and worry that this was somehow all my fault. I couldn't change it so it felt like I was watching a ship slowly sink right in front of my eyes.

Or just do something that will take focus away from the event. I don't want to be a part of any drama. Everyone there thinks that this is the first time we've seen eachother in a couple years. I'd like it to stay that way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone had something like this, where soon after the end you were forced to see each other?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I just block his number now. Or keep it unblocked, and if he tries to bait me before the party just grey rock, but don't completely ignore before blocking him after the event? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nApologies for the ramblings and hope I followed the rules correctly--I read them, I think I did! Just stumbled on this community by researching how to end things and made an account. Thanks for providing a space to be able to talk. I don't have anyone to talk to and I couldn't get an appointment with my old therapist in time before this party!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He was verbally, emotionally, and eventually physically abusive. I could tell you all stories of the horrific ways he abused me. I could talk about the good times too, and as you know, there were many good times that kept me there for 5.5 years. However, I thought this was more interesting. I didn't know he was NPD when we dated. He was my college professor, that's how we met, and I was 12 years his junior, young and naive. Recently, I came across an old folder in my email where I had kept our old correspondence, in case I needed it for legal matters (there were many threats through out the break up, including killing me and my family). The second (and last) time he got physical with me, I called off the wedding (6 weeks before the date), and moved out of our shared apartment and back to my parents house. I stopped taking his calls and only would respond to emails about getting my stuff out of our apartment. After the last of my stuff was moved out, he began calling and texting non-stop (obviously realizing that he'd finally lost control of me, I don't think he actually thought I'd move out or call the wedding off). His second to last time trying to hoover me (He actually reached out again 2 YEARS LATER LMAO) was via E-mail, which I also kept. At the time I knew it was manipulative, but reading it now, 7 years later, it's striking to me how much is reads like a classic from the NPD playbook. I've redacted names for anonymity, but I thought I'd re-post it here to get some thoughts,  and maybe a little game of **name that NPD the behavior**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe email: \n\n(Nex's ex-wife) and I ended our relationship in hostility and coldness, and that  is a real burden to bear, knowing that someone feels so bitterly against  you.\u00a0 I didn't like that feeling then, and I guess I still don't, but  there was nothing I could do  to change it in that case, with (Nex's ex-wife).\u00a0 It looks like\u00a0you and I\u00a0are now  in that same state.\u00a0 Despite everything you'd always told me, and even  things you've said to me this very summer--that you'd always care for  me, I could call on you in an emergency, that  you\u00a0forgive me for the wrong I've done to you, and so on--now it seems  that you don't respond to me in any way (facebook, email, phone), unless  it's about your washer and dryer.\u00a0 I guess that means you want me  to\u00a0piss off and leave you alone.\u00a0 I just want  to tell you how much that hurts me, deep down, that after everything  we've been through together, it's all just washed away over a month or  two and now you just hate me.  \n \n\nThis is why I called, and left a message when you wouldn't answer.\u00a0 Then  when I saw that missed call, I had hope for a minute that maybe it  wasn't so, but now I don't know what to think.\u00a0 I guess I'd rather not  just \\_assume\\_ that someone hates me.\u00a0 I guess  I'd like to \\_know\\_ if that's the case.\u00a0 I guess I'd like to hear you  say it, if it's true.\u00a0 But it seems like you won't do me the courtesy to  say anything to me one way or other.\u00a0 And I guess that ultimately means  that you really do hate me, or at least not  care anything about me.\u00a0   \n \n\nYou know, I only sent you that congratulatory message on facebook  because I genuinely do care about you and your happiness in life.\u00a0 Out  of 1000 friends on facebook, how many of them even bothered to click  \"Like\" for that major life-event of yours?\u00a0 About 10,  as I recall.\u00a0 10 out of 1000 even care.\u00a0 I was one of those.\u00a0 If you  want to burn all your bridges and live with that kind of bitterness,  you're a free person.\u00a0 I just can't understand it, and it really hurts  me.  \n \n\nI'm assuming I won't hear back from you, in reply to this.\u00a0 I don't know  what else there is to do.\u00a0 I'm sorry for all the hurt I've caused you.\u00a0  I sincerely forgive any hurt you caused me.\u00a0 It breaks my heart to know  that someone who once loved me like no one  else ever has, now hates me and won't even acknowledge me.\u00a0 I guess  that's just my burden to bear now.\u00a0 Unless I hear from you, you won't  hear from me again.

She had to make it very clear that if I was doing something nice for her, that it was my decision, and she owed me nothing emotionally, as I was doing it of my own free will. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nExamples: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to take to her to Scotland, I booked the airbnb and told her. \n\n\"So am I coming to Scotland with you?\" \n\n(Of course I do, but I wanted to get her to be direct for once) \n\n\"Do you want to come to Scotland?\" \n\n\"If you don't want to go with me that's fine.\" \n\n\"I'd like you to come if you want to come with me.\"\n\n\"If you want alone time, that's fine.\"\n\n\"So do you want to come with me?\" \n\n\"If you want me to come.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to go to a 35mm screening of Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds. \n\n\"What time is it?\" \n\n\"9. Do you like the film? It would make me sad if you're not going to enjoy it because I really like it\"\n\n\"Ok, go with someone else.\" \n\n\"Do you like the film?\"\n\n\"I will go to it, but you can go with someone else if you want though I don't know why.\"\n\n\"Do you want to come?\" \n\n\"I don't mind.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis in retrospect, seems to be a form of control. She said many times that she had a broad disdain of \"men\". Is this toxic feminism or narcissism, or both?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a huge festival relevant to our industry. She knew it means the world to both of us. She booked to stay with a friend of hers without even asking me if I was going. I was just so surprised that she did it without consulting me, it felt like such a \"fuck you\" that she was going with this person to potentially have more social opportunities. I was upset but I'm not controlling, I just became very quiet and told her to go with her friend, as she'd very clearly rather do that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer stance to my reaction was \"there is nothing wrong with what I'm doing and I don't know why you're upset.\"  She said she'd stay with me out of pity, and I refused. She was just like \"I don't know what your problem is, but I'm trying to be sensitive.\" I told her I didn't want to stay with her if she didn't want to stay with me. She later then told me she'd stay with me -- shortly after I told her I had been invited to a yacht party. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe knew very well what the problem is. Why is it such a big deal to admit that? I know this is a more transparent example of her using/narc nature, but why is she SO sure she wants to stay with someone else, but can't tell me what she wants? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can only think that this behavior is a sign of control and a lack of empathy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I ever made a derogatory comment about my personality, even just a whimsical thought. \"I'm in a weird mood today\", she would POUNCE on any comments I made, and just ride them and relentlessly. Another time I hung up on a cold caller and said \"Bleugh, hanging up makes me feel like such an asshole\". She would strongly agree with the notion that I was an asshole, and use the fact I said that against me in the future. \"Even you admit you're an asshole!\" The worst thing I said off the cuff was \"I really need to get better at empathy\", and I never heard the end of that. Every-time she didn't get her way, she'd accuse me of exhibiting a lack of empathy. It was kind of a snowball effect where she would weaponize anything I had told her in order to drag me down. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this the whole mentality of \"If I drag you down, I feel better about myself?\"\n\nWhat confuses me, was weeks before she was saying I was \"perfect\" and \"really good for her\", then suddenly she's consistently degrading me. What causes this switch? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe was extremely combative and disagreeable. She was incredibly shocked that I saw through all of her tactics. Anything I said, would be wrong. She would not challenge my areas of expertise of course, but if she thought I was talking about a subject that I was not well read on, she would whole-heartedly disagree and take on the tone that I was fucking stupid for believing what I was saying. Sometimes however, I would be well-read on the subject and took her to debate. She did (what I have since learned) the classic narc tactic of diverting her point down a rabbit hole of red herrings and different angles before returning to her original point to bamboozle me into submission. She wasn't debating, she was just trying to win. I never let her divert her point, and I really put her in a corner in one debate, where she had to give a straight answer. I saw a look of shock in her eyes, it was a strangely profound moment. It was like she had no-where to run, and couldn't conjure up anymore distractions or bullshit. Later that evening she told me that I could be very defensive, and volatile like her father. (Anyone who knows me, knows that this is complete utter BS). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this living in fantasy La La Land? Are narcs so deep in their bullshit that they discount logic and clear answers as irrelevant to their self image? When she had nowhere to go, she turned to guilt trip by exploiting my compassionate nature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe would never initiate any signs of affection. She never initiate a kiss. She would let me hold her hand but never reach for mine. In private or not, she would never hug me or initiate sex. I was not unhygienic or anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot sure if this was also a control thing, or whether she just didn't find me attractive :&lt; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I went to break up with her. She burst into tears and told me she was seriously mentally unwell. She said she needed therapy, and I told her that I wouldn't give up on her. That I loved her and I thanked her for her eventual honesty. \n\nShe cancelled our plans the next day - and the day after. Finally met on the third day. She was OFF. Had nothing to share, was incredibly uncomfortable. That night she calls me and says she is going to leave me before I leave her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is the ultimate sign of control right? Could it be possible that because I had a certain degree of awareness of what she was up to, she knew this was a game she couldn't win? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCan anyone offer any insight or similar experiences?

Comment of your weight how you look like a whale and how you eat like a pig always telling you what to eat, and how much to eat to have that phrase in your head saying no MAN is going to want you or love you. All men want a healthy skinny girlfriend or wife ever since then my insecurities grew as I got older always wearing baggy clothes and even jacket when it was 100 degrees outside. Imagine going through all of that and to finally met someone who came in your life at the age of 19, graduated from school and wear a size 15 in pants and 1x in shirts weigh about 200 at the time. We have been together for about 4 years its been a long time and feels like its been more than 4. At first he was my hero, he was my handsome charming prince to rescue me from my father who didn't love me or showed me how a man should treat his woman, this was my first relationship and my first boyfriend when we meet he was such a sweetheart so nice such a gentlemen, told me i was beautiful in his eyes. Sure enough he swept me off my feet he would listen when me and my father would talk to each other while we were on the phone he sure didn't like how my father was talking to me ugly  so he said the magic words \u201cpack up am coming to get you '' At first I was nervous to leave home but then i was like im so tired of this no man should ever talk to his daughter like this and made the \u201cworst decision ever\u201d and ran away with him and never came back home. The first few weeks was okay we lived with his mom and friends here and there we really didn't have our own place. As the months pass by he starting showing signed he started getting abusive when he gets upset starting to lock the gates for me not to get out. Checking my phone answering my calls and checking my Facebook controlling the things i was doing to the point were I was so happy to get into college and he kept coming inside the private college to get me and leave, it was the most embarrassing thing that happened to me ever since then I stopped going because I don't want to cause trouble with him.Then one day i found a clear glass pipe in  the washer from washing his pants I confronted him what was it he tried and did a good dam great job from hiding it from me. He was angry and boom the monster taz came out all you can feel is his hands hitting your stomach your arms and back.the aftermath felt so numb and your head pounding blood dripping from the cuts and busted lips.At this point I was at my all time lowest i guess all  guys don't know how to show love i guess they all the same and I just accepted it , I accepted that my father was right no man was going to love me. Hes been hook on his drugs for years his excuse was his childhood life and how he lost his baby boy at 5 years old but that drug is not going to make the pain go away or fix it. The thought came in my head what if he stayed  sober, he would change he would be better at one point he was sober for 6 months but relapse and still continued to do it. When he was sober he was different he cooked our meals he made sure the house was clean, he would do our laundry and he worked. He was not physical when he got upset he was more affectionate but that didn't last long. Plus like they say some will change and some will still be the same.At the 2 year of our relationship I decided to move to my grandmother's house who knew he would go to the house and destroy my grandmother car broke the backdoor window and sliding door and broke my window and demanded I leave with him and yes we called the cops but the cops came so late. Once the cops didn't do nothing about it i knew i had to handle it myself so i gave a kiss to my  grandmother and  i said enough is enough and went back to him so he wouldn't do anything to the house or to my family. He pawned everything i had to get his drugs i had to figure a way out where he would not go to my grandmother's house so we stayed in the streets for months. At the time we both didn't work my last job I had he didn't want me to go to work but stay with him i was so low in my life everything that was happening to me i was asking god why me.Until i decided lets go to a shelter and we went I stayed there for about 3 months and he stayed for 2 months and then he got banned from the shelter and knew this time was my time now he not allowed to come in the facility and he knows am not at my grandmothers home so the perfect unexpected call received and it was the jail place and said he was going to be away for a long time. Ever since then I got my life back i have a roof over my head a good paying job and i own my own car and still continuing to grow.***", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Always thought I was cheating etc. I proved over and over again I wasn\u2019t.\n\nLastly I always felt like she was spending way more than we needed especially at restaurants and things like theme parks. I would always mention let\u2019s just eat at home but she would always insist it was ok and we would eat out quite often. The theme park thing was mostly her and her family. I never went because if I\u2019m not working then I\u2019m not making a paycheck. She\u2019s a cna and gets amazing vacation time. The tune we were at the apartment I think her and her family went like 5 times to a theme park. Way more than what should have been went.\n\nSorry for such a king post but that sums up how my ex was to me. And to clarify she invited me to the theme parks I just couldn\u2019t afford to go.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He knew he was hurting me, but he didn\u2019t know how to stop, because everything was about him. What he wanted, what he needed, what he was going through, his time, his emotions. He prioritized EVERYTHING above me and made me think I was crazy to think that I deserved more. I\u2019ve never been treated so badly, by anyone. So many lies, manipulation, gaslighting\u2026 sounds classic, right?\n\nWe had the perfect cycle of lovebomb, devalue, discard, hoover, and then an even more humiliating and horrifying discard when he went running back to his ex-wife, because he missed the status and material things and convenience of that relationship. Unbeknownst to me, he had been hoovering her back into his life, while still devaluing me, and then starting the triangulation. \n\nBut even though he did all these awful, evil things, he played the victim all the way through. He had what appeared to be a full blown mental breakdown, claiming he was heartbroken over me but ultimately this other relationship was more important in his life. He had to change his behaviour so that he could be happy, he was going to therapy, and he was so, so sorry and always would be and blah blah blah\u2026\n\nSo here\u2019s my confusion. Everything I\u2019ve read says that narcissists aren\u2019t capable of feeling sorrow, or responsibility for their behaviour, or are willing or even capable of change. And maybe his reasons for \u2018changing\u2019 are purely selfish and to further his status, but he\u2019s still doing it. For someone else. He\u2019s making her a priority, he\u2019s going to much-needed therapy for her, he\u2019s apparently happy.\n\nI have lost everything that was important to me - my mental health, my physical health, a pregnancy (it was early, and I miscarried - I would\u2019ve had an abortion either way - doesn\u2019t make it any less devastating), a 15 year history with someone else that I said no to for my (n)ex, my work happiness (we work in the same office), and after everything he told me about how much he loved me, two weeks later he was claiming that his ex-wife was the love of his life. So he\u2019s gotten everything he wanted, and I lost my sanity. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to think anymore. I\u2019ve made huge progress in healing, but I\u2019m having a rough few weeks. We\u2019re N/C when it was no longer convenient for him to guilt-trip me for refusing to be friends with him, but the devastation of him changing his behaviour for someone else is unbearable. He sounded sincere and remorseful when he said he would always be sorry and he would always feel shitty about himself for doing this to me, but I don\u2019t believe it. He\u2019s only sorry when it\u2019s convenient for him.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My mom quickly drove away and he chased us up the street a little. Us crying, him pissed, and my mom scared, she took pictures of the mirror and called the police. When one came, my mom told him what happened so he went to our house but it was empty. So the police man left. My mom, L, and I went to see my mom's mom to calm down some. After talking to her we felt a little better so my mom took us to get sandwiches. When we got home we saw he left a note saying we went to our cabin himself. The next day he came home and tried to guilt-trip us by saying he could have \"frozen\". We tried to ignore him. After a month he forgot about it. My mom did a little and my brother forgot it. I NEVER did.\n\nHe has done so much else. When I have told my classmates a little they really wanted me to call CPS. I want to yet I love them and I'm scared CPS will take us away.

Everything is great we talk about sex and she says she wants to wait Not until marriage but until she feels is the right moment.

We go to grab some McDonald\u2019s and she hands me her phone to scan the McDonald\u2019s app right as I get the phone back a text appears from Matt saying\u201d come on let me cum on your face this time. I park the car and I demand she tell me what\u2019s going on she tells me everything sobbing how she\u2019s only been jerking him off since her slumber party because he took a photo of her naked while she was asleep and threatened to send it to everyone.

She tells me that she only did this for practice because she wanted our first time to be special and she was still a virgin because she hadn\u2019t orgasmed while they had sex. We went back downstairs and Like and idiot being my first girlfriend I forgave her if she promised never to do it again. Unfortunately it wouldn\u2019t be she never stopped and she would cheat on me another 4 times before she ended it with me and that special time she was practicing for never happened because and I quote \u201cI honestly can\u2019t see myself ever wanting to have sex with you\u201d \n\n14 months in the abuse started I became insecure constantly I begged for reassurance that she still liked me and she became annoyed by it. one day in rage she hit me to shut me up and it worked because next thing I know whenever she was angry or had a bad day or wanted me to shut up she would beat me closed fist to the face and I took it, I would apologize. I have become so broken that to this day I believe it is my fault she cheated. And she would tell me how pathetic I was and how I could never leave because I would never get anyone to like me. She would beat me while she was crying sometimes saying if I was more attractive she\u2019d actually be happy. Those where the ones that got me the most she knew how to tear me down. And at the end of every beating she would sit down and cry and tell ME that she couldn\u2019t believe I wouldn\u2019t trust her that it hurt her feelings and that she loved me.this pattern would go on until she broke up with me for the guy she first cheated on me with.

And, to make things worse, she is a professor of psychology at a local college. Go figure. The worst kind. My signs were this: I felt I never knew her, like she was secretive and that she would only allow me with only one foot in to the door of her heart. Kept me an arms distance length away. The love bombing - WOW. Well, the \"I love you\" came pretty quickly, maybe a month or 6 weeks. The sex. She couldn't get enough. The flattery, texts, emails everything. Then as time went on, the \"honeymoon\" faded. The devaluation: subtle low hits, very intense jealousy and I mean insane jealousy. If I looked at another woman, I'd get the cold stone stare. Arguments. She never once apologized or admitted responsibility for anything. My \"reactive abuse\" was scream at her saying that she could do no wrong, and it was always my fault. I threw my keys at her once, I regret that. I'd have to ask very subtle, \"is it ok if I go to my favorite sports bar and watch football?\" - I had to ask permission for a lot of things. Her silent treatment a lot - I never knew when she was mad sometimes, she would with hold it only to say something days later. Then blame me for it. To the outside world, she was a sweet, shy woman. My family thought she was the best thing to ever happen to me. During this phase, I had a funny feeling - \"something just didn't feel right\" - my gut instincts were telling me something, I had no idea. More fights, no apology - I always did. I'd lie to her to keep the peace, or just bend and look the other way in order to keep her happy. This went on for a year (year 2). The middle of year 3, I hear say several times \"I am bored in this relationship!\" - several times I mind you. Then one day, she says \"I don't want to be your friend, I just want sex\". I was like WTH?? Really. This went on all throughout year 3. Beginning of year 4 - the discard March 2019. I had a private conversation with a female friend on facebook. So, i knew she had seen the post where I said \"PM me\". So, being a nice guy and not wanting her to freak out, I shared the PM's with her. She got really silent - cold stare. She asked where I knew this woman from. I said \"I had danced with her at a tiki bar a year and half before I met you\". So, she said to me \"how'd you like if I contacted the guy I dated before you?\" I said, who cares, it was before me and if y'all are friends, I wouldn't care; and I said that \"I knew this woman before you\". And, I told her there was nothing between us and never was. Even still, she just went blank. The next day, she told me to leave. I have never heard from her since - like she fell off the face of the earth. No closure, no nothing. She had absolutely no empathy ever. Well, for a month I was wrecked - like an emotional category 5 hurricane. I went nuts. She gaslighted me soooo bad for 3 years, I thought it was me. Then, I posted a very long short version of the relationship on another support site. Some one replied back saying, that based on what I mentioned, she has narcissistic traits. At first I thought \"No, she is a psychologist\". But, this poster opened my eyes. I spent a week (while at work!) reading about this. And WOW, I realized it wasn't me. That she is a covert narc. A lot of the symptoms of it and also sociopathic symptoms. Now, I am somewhat educated on this and now in therapy because of this monster of a woman. I never knew her, I only knew the mask. Until she showed the true side. Even my therapist agrees she abused me. I am now in the \"calling her out\" at this point. I have met 5 people - 1 is a former client of hers who said she is terrible. The others, all have said she is not right and very narcissistic. Now everything adds up. It wasn't me at all. Now, she is love bombing a new victim, I saw them a few weeks ago. I soooo wanted to get in the guys face and tell him to RUN FORREST, RUN! But, I didn't. Hopefully he'll figure her BS out - the insane jealousy, manipulative etc.. I have a feeling that she was communicating with this new guy before she discarded me. - only one thing: I learned a very valuable lesson. I am an empath in sorts, giant, huge heart that would do anything for anyone just about. I now have a female friend, and things are going very well - and SLOWLY. No love bomb. She is normal, after what I've learned in the past few months about this terrible personality disorder I now know the signs. In fact one person I talked to about the ex, said she knew she was like that - I told this chick \"Why didn't you tell me?\" She just I had hoped that the covert narc wouldn't do that to such a fantastic guy, but she did. This gal told me how sorry she was for not telling me. But, my new friend is very understanding, I told her everything. We've only been dating since Easter - not long. But I felt I had to tell her. BTW, this gal I am dating is not the same one who knew and should've told me, two separate people. My story is much longer but I am sure y'all can relate. Be safe from the wolves wearing sheep skin! They can certainly fool people. She had me and a lot of other people I know fooled! I am now in recovery, with the help of a really good therapist, my family and friends and my new sweetie pie!

I ended up texting him that I was sorry but I wasn\u2019t feeling super great and I was going to try to go to bed. Well he basically turned into a huge baby and threw a fit how he wanted to come see me and I must not care about him or his needs, it\u2019s all about me, everything is on my time, depending on my mood, etc. I ended up telling him he was being ridiculous and I wasn\u2019t going to engage in that conversation anymore. It wasn\u2019t about me or him or my \u201cmood\u201d it was just I was tired and didn\u2019t feel good and just wanted to go to bed and not be up super late and if he actually cared as much about me as he claims, he would of said to go to sleep and feel better and hope to see you tomorrow and stop trying to make me feel selfish and guilty. He responded with saying that I was right, but then in the next text flipped back to saying it was all about me and I don\u2019t worry about other people or what they want or need.

He can even turn a compliment in an argument.   \n\nIf I call back my dog from the street, I'm a hysteric person who worries all the time, if I ask How are you, is everything oke?, then I'm thinking negative cause I assume he's not oke.

I\u2019ve kicked myself in the ass over this for about two years now but I think I\u2019m ready to talk. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. Also, I\u2019m a 20 year old female.\n\nA couple years back I met my N-ex and since then I haven\u2019t felt the same. That\u2019s as plainly as I can put it. He abused me emotionally for months before I recognized what that I wasn\u2019t the problem, and that it was him. And then things gradually turned more and more physical. At that time I had done so much research on his behavior (which Narcissism described to a \u201cT\u201d, thank you internet) and it got to the point where I finally understood it. \n\nHe was psychopathic. I can honestly say he made me fear for my life, I have never met such a devious and fucked up person. He cheated on me with 4 different girls (that I know of) all the while accusing me of cheating and doing every single thing that he did, which I would never, ever do. He would hold me down if I ever tried leaving during arguments, hit me if I tried defending myself and his go-to last resort was to break down and sob about how he would kill himself if I ever tried leaving him. He would say that I was just like everyone else in his life, that I had given up on him, etc. He could create arguments out of thin air that would last for hours, or days, and at some point I wouldn\u2019t even know what the hell had been the issue in the first place. It was hard for me to find the strength to leave him when I truly believed I'd be responsible for his death.\n\nI have dealt with social anxiety since I was very young, and I\u2019ve only had about one or two close friends or people that I felt comfortable talking to about my personal issues. My parents are strict, disconnected and apathetic. They\u2019ve been too involved in their own lives, I would say, to pay attention to anything but that. So far I feel like life has been me vs. the world. I am so scared to ask for help. I don\u2019t see people as people anymore, I think I see them as threats. I worry about every single person I meet -- are they like my ex? Are they like my parents? Do they even like me or am I just giving them something they want?\n\nThat relationship ended with me threatening to get a restraining order, blocking him on everything and even confiding in the school staff about how he would stalk and harass me, because at the time he had manipulated all of my friends into thinking *I* was crazy. Eventually he was banned from setting foot on their property because we discovered that he had done this to multiple different girls, but that didn\u2019t stop him from worming his way back into my life and even *coming to the school again*. He would create new accounts to talk to me, he would try and get to me through other people (my friends, which are now all his ironically lol) and it felt like I was trapped. I had never felt so miserable over another human being, I was failing all of my classes at that point and I've always been an A-B student. I lost an insane amount of weight over the course of our relationship, and then was finally hospitalized and put on new medication. Since being hospitalized and having that huge mental breakdown, I have experienced what feels to me like hell. Constant mood swings and paranoia that others are out to get me.\n\nFlash forward and right now I am with a different guy, but I\u2019m worrying myself sick over the realization that he might be just like my ex. I\u2019ve tried so hard to figure this out by myself but I can only have so much perspective in my little antisocial bubble. I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to about this, I\u2019ve been scared to even put these thoughts into words. \n\nI\u2019ll list some of the traits I\u2019ve noticed in him that seem like red flags or weird behavior. I have a hard time knowing what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not anymore, I can\u2019t decipher if this is just me overthinking due to past experiences or if my gut is trying to tell me something. If you have any input or advice, whatever it may be, please let me know. \n\n* **Sensitive to criticism, while at the same time being highly critical of others when it suits him.** I remember at first I had grown to like him because of how fondly he described the people in his life. I\u2019ve come to realize that when he says things like that, it seems more like a superficial comment he\u2019s making in order to feel good about himself, as opposed to a genuine thought. He has gotten progressively less positive and 10x more critical of people since we\u2019ve been together. He\u2019s admitted to being a bully, and being mean, but it took living with him for several months for me to actually see that (moreso when he would play video games or talk to people on Discord. He acted like an entirely different person.)\n* **Talking about wealth, his future and fame on a daily basis.** This one is really starting to get under my skin. He talks about himself a lot, and I don\u2019t mind that mostly, but after hearing him monologue about how he wants to be rich enough to come back and help all the people that struggle back home when he\u2019s famous (\"because nobody else would do it\") so many times, I start to wonder if he lives through fantasy in his head. This feels dangerously similar to my last relationship, where my ex would constantly describe our future together that was too good to be true.\n* **Odd behavior?** It\u2019s very hard to describe how I feel around him. I\u2019ve discussed it with him before, saying that it always feels like his attention is drawn into something else. As in, I feel like I can never have his full attention. We do activities together all of the time, most of them with other people, but hardly ever do I feel that he is engaging with me, asking me questions, or paying close attention to how I\u2019m feeling in the moment. I always feel this strange \u201cdisconnect\u201d, like maybe he isn\u2019t emotionally in-tune. \n* **Being most present when we\u2019re actually together, rather than staying connected with me all of the time.** Like my ex, he has very \u2018robotic\u2019 responses over text that can seem unemotional and disinterested. He also tends to respond spontaneously even though I know he goes on his phone all of the time, regardless if I\u2019m there or not. He\u2019s very mysterious about what he does when I\u2019m not with him, and I get worried at times because I did find him in a dating server on Discord early on in our relationship. He justified being in it by saying it was \u201cjust for fun, everyone in there was retarded and it was funny to him\u201d but\u2026 I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s never something I would do, just out of respect for our relationship. I hardly talk to anybody as it is, which I know is bad but I have been trying to work on my social skills. This is extremely hard for me because I've been cheated on and lied to so many times. I have had suspicions of him cheating because of how unaffectionate and inattentive he is, but he always tells me he'd never do that. \n* **Every time I\u2019ve tried addressing the things I notice in his behavior, he has had a breakdown which usually lead to me consoling him** (rather than him consoling me, despite me being the one who was upset in the first place.) Most recently, I admitted that I feel like I give so much to him but don\u2019t get much back in return, to where he started crying (because I was crying?) and said he doesn\u2019t know why he is the way he is. This was how my previous boyfriend reacted, although he was definitely abusive about it. The guy I'm with now seems to put on this super sensitive facade whenever we have serious conversations. It's like breaking through to a separate, vulnerable person.\n* His father is narcissistic (and diagnosed bipolar) and his mother has mentioned that several times. They are no longer together, and their family\u2019s situation is very complex. He has told me before that he fears turning out like his dad.\n* **We never seem to be on the same wavelength.** I\u2019ve noticed that sometimes if I\u2019m in an extremely good mood, he seems to be in slightly\u2026 uncomfortable, and any time that I might be in a bad mood, he perks up and tries goofing around with me. This could just be coincidence but nonetheless, it\u2019s strange. He can be a little unpredictable.\n* I**f I ever try and express my opinion in an argument, whether supported by fact or not, he has a tendency to correct me even though what he\u2019s saying is the same idea.** It\u2019s like he disagrees just to disagree and feel like he knows more than everyone in the room. He does this with family and friends as well.\n* He loves talking to people, all kinds of people, though I feel as if he sees them objectively. He told me once that he tries to be \"the perfect guy for everyone\", which to me just comes across as fake.\n* **He's unaffectionate and hard to read.** His reasoning for this is just that he's not a very affectionate person, nor is he sexual, but it makes me feel like I'm pulling teeth just to get a meaningful compliment or a hug or kiss. Or even sex. It leaves me feeling guilty for asking for those things, which I know are a very normal part of relationships. I have justified it by trying to understand that people show love in different ways, but I'm not really sure anymore.\n\nI\u2019ll leave it at that for right now but those are the ones at the top of my head.

I've (M30) been in a long term relationship with my SO (F28) for five years. We have a home together and have a great relationship. \n\nI've been going to a therapists who suggested I be more open with my family history, so we've been chatting about my past. I will be the first to admit that I didn't have a great childhood. She knew that my parents were abusive, but didn't know to what extent. \n\nAfter opening up to her she didn't take it very well, in fact she was pretty horrified. She cried, got really angry, and started yelling that I was literally tortured. I didn't think that it was that important, but she's really latched on to the torture thing.\n\n My father used to make me reach for a spot on a wall as high as I could while on the tips of my toes. He'd draw a line on the wall at the end of my longest finger, if I dipped below the line, looked away from the line, checked the time, or made a noise I'd be hit in the back of the legs with a paddle hard enough to bleed and have to do 15-30 more minutes. \n\nIt sucked, I used to have nightmares about it. The thing is, if she considered this literal torture, then the other stuff is going to be way harder to tell her. I started with something that I thought was pretty mild.\n\nThe problem is that i still talk to my parents. We aren't close but, I still see them once a month or so, mainly to support my sister. My SO is sweet and a great person, however she does have a temper and is very protective. How do I talk to her about some of the harder aspects of my life without upsetting her to the point where she wants to vengeance kill my parents? Or should I keep it to myself? \n\nTL;DR - told partner of abuse experienced as a child, she is shook. Problem, I started of with someone mild.

He is almost completely psychotic at times while wearing a facade that would have you believe you are talking with a real charmer. As the fourth and completely un wanted child to his family, Ive been punched, kicked, told how I would not become anything and that I ruined his life by being born. it carried on for years, I only wish my mother had the guts to kick him out. She tried hard to support us but at the same time absolutely refused to get rid of his jobless arse and enabled his drunken activities. he'd drink away any hope of good schooling support while berating me for trying to make anything of myself, hobbies included. Later on he would try to kill me twice, both by leaving me for dead in the cold and leaving me beaten and bruised far away from home. All this happened while I suffered from school bullying as well, to most I look a freak compared to them.

i was not just abused by that \"friend\" i was also abused by my cousins and family members as dumb as it seems i was 14-15 at that time and yes i just realized that was abuse i was being hit every now and then for dumb reasons and i would not react because i was senseless at the time and i think i was so lonely that even an abusive state like that would not matter to me as long as i had someone to be with they taught me stuff about sex too and masturbation at a really young age too which fucked my childhood all they way up , was being tricked into getting to our grandad's garage at night and then they just turn the lights out or hit me and then turn them out just because they can and i was scared of darkness too , they asked me for my money all the time and i did not talk up to them a lot because getting hit was starting to feel scary and dangerous as even though they ruined me i didn't want to cause them any harm nor their mothers as they were good to me and helped me get through life they would threaten me about it and i realized how little they could actually do if i tell everyone everything until later on my current age 17 just hit it too and yes i never told anyone anything about what happened to me i never really trusted people and my parents never made me feel like they understood me but they tried and i really appreciate that so i love them even after some mistakes but well all fuck up at some point so who cares they also sent me to a psychologist at some point in my middle school but it never really worked and i didn't go more than 2 times i mean to give a person that probably knows what's wrong with him a card with stuff like anxiety issues trust issues deep past and other crap... like i'm sort of a test product just hell no dude and all the questions he asked were stuff i figured out so it was pretty useless it's not like he's inexperienced he's well known and has a phd or whatever but idk i just told the truth better than he did, ik that everything is so messed up in my story and everything became like that after getting sick but i'm really trying to organise things and not ruin them as in our current world people judge by other people's eyes and call it absolute truth like there is no way but their way anyways i'm at my last year of highschool and if i hopefully pass this last exam i'll be in college by next year and it's only a week away i'm pretty much fine to me right now altho i have a masturbation addiction that i'm trying to conquer and i'm pretty much still isolate but i accepted my past and everything now and i don't really care about it as i'm trying to move forward and forward only i can't be stuck in the past nor the present trying to think less and live the moment as we only get to live once.  \nthank you so much for listening and i'm really sorry if you didn't understand anything out of this but i appreciate the opportunity of writing this as i know deep inside that it will help me become a better person", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I won't say the details but it's a mixture of physical, mental and sexual abuse. This one man has started destroying my life since I was little and only now I'm old enough to realise what he has done to me. There is this one event in december that just made it all so clear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis happened in december of last year. I was in my room of my old house, just texting some of my friends late in the night when I hear some voices from the kitchen. I just peek out my door and see that it's just my dad on the phone with my mom, who is almost always at work and I barely get to talk to so I exit my room and stop by to say hi to her. At first it's all good, but then my mom says something about how my dad still hadn't payed the Wi-Fi bill, which I needed for school because of some upcoming projects. He then immediately starts to get louder and louder, saying he won't pay it anymore because of I don't even know what reason. He got so angry that when I just asked \"Why though?\" he paused the game he was playing, turned to me and started screaming with his face 2 INCHES AWAY FROM MINE. That is....that is so fucking weird! It made me feel so uncomfortable but I couldn't do anything because I was in the corner of the room and couldn't move. My mom hears the screaming from the other side of the phone and is telling my dad to stop doing whatever he is doing, along with quieting down because the neighbors were going to wake up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReading all of that was just so sudden right? That's how it felt in real life. He got extremely mad over NOTHING.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe ignores her. While he is screaming in my face he starts putting his hands on my cheecks and talks/screams with a tone that...God, if you heard it it would literally make you want to kick something. It's the \"know-it-all\" professor kind of tone, the one that just says \"I'm better than you\". He started each and every one of his sentences by saying my name, which I ABSOLUTELY hate and by now everything about this was making me feel uncomfortable and irritated, even he calling me \"Honey\" When saying stuff that he knew was going to piss me off. I swear to God I think that was the best composure I've ever kept in my entire life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do I do to get out of this? I just move away as soon as he starts to back up a little and since my dad was screaming at me I made what I think was both the worst mistake of my life and the most disrespectful thing I've ever done. I just said calmly \"call me on my phone, please\" and hung up the call with my mom. I slowly walked away and my dad wanted to hit me but he only managed to hit my back as I was walking away. At this point he just stopped talking and got silent and I didn't dare turn around to look at him. I just walked to my room without him interrupting me, looking back at it I think he was trying to take off his belt because I heard...you know, the metallic sound that belts make.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I got back to my room and locked the doors calmly, all this while still not looking back at the kitchen. My phone was on my bed and my mom was already calling me, knowing her she must have thought my dad was already beating the shit out of me because when she heard my voice she sounded really panicked. I talk to her for a bit almost whispering and we say stuff about my dad, she mentions she is probably a bit drunk because he drank too much beer that evening...just like every evening. I'm so angry I start silently crying. I just whisper-yell \"I'm so fucking sick of him! When will you just kick him out for fuck's sake?!\" (My mom doesn't care if I swear because my dad swears a lot so she doesn't even try. Also I was angry and she probably didn't want to make things worse.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen...then it starts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust so you know, my room has sliding doors, and they were shaking very, VERY LOUDLY. My dad was outside, yelling at me to \"let him in or else\". I was so scared I just screamed in fear, my mom still on the phone. He said \"I WILL BREAK THE FUCKING DOOR IF YOU DON'T LET ME IN RIGHT NOW\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom here everything is just a blur.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI remember I was screaming and screaming and I had no way to escape, my room didn't even have windows. There was screaming and screaming and yelling and more screaming... It really seemed like my door was about to break. When we left that house the marks from that night were still there. After some time of this he yells \"IF YOU OPEN THE DOOR NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN BUT I SWEAR TO GOD IF I BREAK IT AND YOU'RE STILL THERE....\" I freaked out. I just threw by phone on my bed in a hurry and unlocked the doors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBig, big mistake. Why the heck did I even trust that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nImmediately he pushes me away, grabs my phone and tries to hang up the call with my mom, and actually misses the button like 3 times because of how angry he is, but immediately after he puts it in his pocket and he basically charges at me. He starts slapping me, kicking me in the stomack, punching me...so much that at one point I fell and in an attempt to not hit my head on the floor I tried grabbing the closest things to my hands. I ended up drabbing my bedsheets which just fell with me and my dad's shirt which RIPPED IN HALF and I still fell. Even from the floor he just kept beating the ever loving crap out of me, I was still screaming in pain but mostly fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe then rushes out of my room and I just yell out \"WHY?!\" because yeah, ok, I had been disrespectful but that was way too much. He answers me but I don't remember what he said, I just remember that he grabbed me and pushed me out of my room, basically starting to hit me again in the living room and this goes on for what feels like ages.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGuys...as you may guess this story is really hard to type out. It's hard to really put all that into words. So many parts are really blurry because I've been trying to get this memory out of my head but I swear to God...his eyes were so scary that night. You know how in anime those crazy people widen their eyes and it feels like their pupils get smaller? Well, that night I found out that wasn't just the style. Those eyes haunt me every night whenever I remember them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut enough of that. After what feels like ages my mom bursts through the door and immediately separated me and my dad. I was so in shock that I couldn't breathe for what felt like entire minutes and I could barely hear what they yelled about. By now the neighbors had turned on the lights but it wasn't of much use. My mom grabbed my phone from my dad, told me to pack my things because I was sleeping with her that night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou see, my mom owns a restaurant and she always works so much she almost never has time to sleep, so she just has a bedroom on the second floor that's now become my official room. Anyway, I stay there and immediately after we get there my mom calls my grandparents and my uncle, telling them everything that happened and I start texting my boyfriend while still crying. I'm so lucky he is so amazing and comforted me by even seding audio messages of just him whispering to calm down, that everything way going to be alright and just try to tell him what happened. And yeah, that was the night. My mom said many times she would divorce my dad and would send him back to our home country and blah blah blah, all just meaningless noise to me at the time. I fell asleep and slept until 12AM of the next morning. Obviously my mom didn't want to send me to school.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI avoided my dad for months after that and just a few weeks ago my uncle came to visit and stayed for 3 weeks since he lives in a different country. During his stay I would always show him places that I liked and talked to him, he really feels like a real dad to me. And well...he told me something. Apparently my dad has been drinking so much he started vomiting blood after being hungover. It wasn't like in the movies but it was still noticeable. Basically, if he doesn't get treated and more importantly doesn't stop drinking he will die. When I heard this all I could think of was that I wanted him to just go away and never see him again and that he deserved everything. I am literally wishing for my own dad to die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I right in thinking this? Please consider that this is not the first time something like this has happened, it's just that this is the most \"extreme\" time as of yet.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I never reported it, and when my family moved when I was 10, I figured I had escaped/could leave everything in the past (even though I was terrified that I would be found and hurt by my abuser again).\n\nI eventually told my sister and parents. My dad didn't believe me (my dad and I have a lot of problems; he's borderline abusive sometimes, and he says that I'm just too sensitive), but my mom and sister are super supportive.  I have gone through some therapy here and there, and my sister and I have talked a lot about what happened (because, while she was not physically abused like I was, she was emotionally abused and has survivor's guilt for not protecting me when she witnessed him force me to be alone with him (which, in a way, makes me have guilt of her guilt because I love her more than anything) --it's a long story).\n\nWe were so young and everything was so confusing--our abuser was a psychopath (\\*\\*TW\\*\\*just to give a little insight on the types of things that happened: one snowy night, he held me upside down until I had a headache/couldn't see clearly, then he peed on me and made me watch porn while touching me, etc., and then he locked me (naked, wet, and bruised) outside until my toes and fingers were chilblain). I was 7.\n\nAnyways, I keep telling myself that I need to suck it up and move on, but I just can't. I'm now 20, and I've never used a tampon because it hurts too much, I can barely make eye contact with men, and I get terrible stomach aches when I'm alone with anyone who I don't know super well.

I generally can carry the burden, but sometimes I step into a situation, and a rock digs in to one of my scars.\n\nIf you're still reading...I guess I am asking for suggestions on how to overcome/cope/have a relationship/not be a wimp and get a new job, especially when I generally hate therapy (I've tried so many types/so many different therapists, but I just haven't found anyone/anything that really works).\n\nTonight is just another sleepless night, so I figured I'd write what's bothering me rather than letting my tears crust to my face...

This is because I am a student and make less money than he does - he works fulltime. We're both 22, I also work 18hrs a week next to school and studying at home.\n\nThe relationship started out great and we have been through a lot together. When he cheated on me with his ex, things started going downhill. We did end up trying to fix it, went on a two week holiday to Ireland and things got better. However, from the moment of moving in together he started to get more and more agressive (he got physical a few times, but that's not what this post is about).\n\nHe keeps telling me that I am not ready to live together, or live anywhere on my own, he says that I am crazy and that anyone thinks I'm crazy. When I ask him to help me with cleaning, he gets angry instantly, says I am worth nothing to him because he needs someone grown-up to take 'her responsibilities'. He kicks me out of the house often, sometimes only half-dressed or without for example my wallet and/or phone. Then he will call me, apologize, I go back and then he wants me to repeat after him what he wants me to say (usually something along the lines of ''Sorry for being so selfish, sorry for not taking care of you like I'm supposed to, sorry for...) and then when I do it's not good enough and I have to say it again like I mean it. This happens almost everyday. \n\nWe broke up about a month ago, I went to live with my parents for a bit, but while searching for room for myself, I let myself get talked back into moving back in with him. He promised me he wouldn't behave like that anymore (he did stop hitting me, which he thinks means he's changed a lot, but he's still hurting me emotionally), but he still does it almost daily.\n\nHe is nice sometimes though, we do have good times where we really enjoy doing things we both love together and sharing the same humor. That is why we keep getting back together.\n\nI feel like I'm about to have such a breakdown, and it won't end well. How do you talk to someone who doesn't listen and only tells you that you are crazy, keeps interrupting you and only wants you to do what he says? I feel like he has a monster inside of him, and I don't know how to reach the real him when that 'monster' takes over.\n\nI really don't know what to do. I'm not easy either, I get jealous and sometimes mean and in the morning I'm just not ready to hold a conservation. So I do understand how he gets angry with me sometimes.

Her English wasn\u2019t very good, but I was willing to try to make it work since she was going to school for it.  After about a month she told me she loved me. This should have been my first warning sign. I didn\u2019t say it back, but soon I felt like I was forced to.  No matter how much time I spent with her it felt like I didn\u2019t know her. I came to realize she didn\u2019t even know herself.  I was extremely patient and would repeat everything 2-4 times until she understood it. Even defining individual words that I had to repeat. After a year her English was no better. She would asked me to help her on her tests and I told her no, because I really wanted her to learn it.  I would always give in and end up helping her. I really cared for her and was willing to make things work despite our differences. It felt like she was full of apathy tho. No happiness or emotion towards anything and if there was, it was only negative. She would complain about her job and America all the time. I would remind her to be grateful and appreciative for the things she had. But it didn\u2019t seem like she respected anything. I\u2019m a very empathetic person and have a lot of passions and loves. She had absolutely none.   It\u2019s like nothing was ever good enough for her. She always wanted to fight over small little things.  Absolutely no affection or loving feelings were coming from her for the last couple months. I was only her second relationship and it was clear she had no idea how to be in one.

My family (Mum, Dad, Brother and Sister) and I travelled to Peru to hopefully live off of the inheritance we were to receive from my dead kin. Too bad my grandfather stole what was rightfully ours. A few weeks after my birthday we ran out of money and had to rely on the child and unemployment benefits my parents recived every month from the English government.\n\nThe electricity in our unfinished house finally got cut and occasionally our water did aswell. This resulted in taking cold showers (sometimes from a bottle), hand washing our clothes and not having a working fridge.\n\nMy father began to shout at us and hit our mother, accusing her of horrible things and trying to convince me and my siblings of it also. Random slaps turned into beatings which turned into full out torture. \n\nSometimes he asked me how he should kill her. He had many creative ideas like stripping my mother naked and leaving her in the worst neighour hood to get raped and killed.\n\nI always had to keep my face straight so he didn't suspect that she was 'influencing me'. \n\nMy father rarely hit us, although sometimes i wish he would've instead of gaslighting and humiliating us in public. He was a master emotional manipulator. Cocaine and prostitutes were the main reason me and my siblings had to eat ramen and kraft macaroni and cheese every goddamn day.\n\nI spent days thinking about the best way to kill him because i was sure he would kill my mum. Sometimes i wish i did kill him in his sleep or something. \n\nWith around $15,000 dollars given by my stingy great uncle Adrian we travelled to Argentina. We lived in a cockroach infested appartment for a few months and the shouting and beating became normal. My mother began to contribute to the accusations and 'confess' just to keep him from beating her worse I imagine. The worst part was that I started to believe what he was saying.\n\nThis is where the dark thoughts began. I was constantly fighting with my brother and sister due to living practically on top of each other and i felt more and more alone each day.\n\nI decided that living wasn't worth it anymore. \n\nI wrote a suicide note explaining my choice to leave this world at the young age of 14. I had everything planned. In our apartment block we had a very old elevator, My plan was to bring it to the top, and jump down the elevator shaft via the floor below it.\n\nI can't remember why i didn't go through with it. Sometimes i wish i did.\n\nAfter receiving a large sum of what was lost from us, we started living in hotels. We had phones and new clothes but the beatings continued although money wasnt a problem anymore. This new way of living distracted my brother, sister and i from it in a way, we hadn't used the internet or made any contact with friends for so long.\n\n\nThe depression just got worse whenever i wasnt reading or watching a tv series on my phone. In those places all their problems are so simple. \n\nWe moved to Peru for only a month and then to Colombia. Whenever we left a hotel (my father had delusions and paranoia so he always thought my mother had sent people to kill us) he would make me clean the room my mother had being staying in, i would throw away the bloody sheets and scrub the wall if there was also blood on it. The smell of old blood always remained. \n\nOne night in Bogota my father decided that he had enough. He kicked her out for good. She had no passport, no money, no phone, Nothing. Somehow she managed to get to the German embassy, as she is a German citizen, she can receive help from them. She stayed at a church for 2 weeks and then finally flew to Germany. \n\nWith nobody to keep my father occupied, he turned his attention to us 3. \n\nI started to notice that my sister was getting thinner. She would wear 5 shirts in 25\u00b0c heat and complain she was cold. One time i walked in on her changing and all i could see was skin and bone. She was starving herself.\n\nIt was confusing. My father constantly joked and belittled me about my weight but never my sister. Sometimes he would use her as a shining example that i could only wear what i wanted if i lost alot of weight. I guess that affected her more than i had thought.\n\nWhen my father found out he instantly blamed me. He spat in my face and screamed about how i wasn't taking care of my little sister and that it was all my fault.\n\nThat night, my sister told me a secret.\n\nApparently, her and my brother found my suicide note in Argentina. I asked her if they told anyone and she said no. I asked her if they did anything, she said that her and my brother watched me at home until i threw the note away.\n\nThis information broke my heart.\n\nWe moved again to Argentina and then to Uruguay. That is where i ate my first edible but that's another story.\n\nOne night in a rented apartment in Monte Video, my brother had enough. \n\nI woke up the next day and he was gone.\n\nHe took some of our dwindling money and left me alone to take care of my now 36 kilo baby sister and my utterly insane cocaine addicted father all by myself.\n\nThis was not an easy task. Especially since my brother took a large portion of our cash so he could fly back to Bogota to be with his girlfriend.\n\nMy dad sold all of our valuables for more cocaine and after a few days we were left with nothing.\n\nMy sister and i convinced my father to take us to the German embassy. \n\nThey asked me if my father was on drugs (he fucking was and it was obvious) and i said no.\n\nThe thing is, my mother, brother, sister and i all have German passports. But my father does not.\n\nThis meant that the embassy could not pay for his ticket to Germany. I knew this and i was counting down the days until we would be free of him. He had no money for drugs and he was getting more unbearable than ever. He would scream directly into my ear to trigger (i hate that word) my PTSD.\n\nWhen the day came, he begged me not to leave. He told me that we were everything that he had left and that he would kill himself.\n\nI told him that was not my problem anymore, took my sister by the hand and left.\n\nWhen we reunited with my mother in Germany, i could see that my dad knocked almost all of her teeth out. The children in the care home laughed at her when she smiled and i was so close to committing 3 murders.\n\nWe got our on place (we call it a pension) and a week before my 16th birthday, my sister was put in a closed ward because he anorexia was THAT BAD.\n\nMy brother came to Germany before Christmas and he surprised my sister during visiting time. She cried real happy tears when she saw him standing there. \n\nI was always jealous of their relationship as my sister always favoured him even though i was the only one who never abandoned her. \n\nNearly 2 years later, i still have PTSD. \n\nMy psychiatrist thinks i have ADHD but who knows. My sister had gained weight and now she is happier, not happy, Just happier.\n\nWe have an apartment now and we have recently adopted a cat. Her name is Uva and she sleeps next to my mother every night. I tell my mother everything and we have an amazing relationship.\n\nWe are all damaged and really fucked up. I still have suicidal thoughts but i am 100% sure those thoughts will remain just thoughts.\n\nI'm sorry for the long story. I made it as short as i could.

I just shared a couple of resources to someone who asked about this, and I figured I would share a post with everyone just in case others are wondering about their own situations. Keep in mind these diagrams have been made for domestic violence (physical and emotional) situations, but very well may be applicable to other relationships too. \n\nThis is a diagram that describes common behaviors that abusive individuals engage in: [power and control wheel](http://ccwrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PC_Wheel.gif)\n\nAnd this diagram describes the cycle of abuse: [cycle of abuse](https://www.whiteribbon.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cycle-of-violence.jpg)\n\nAbusive behaviors can be extremely insidious and hard to put a finger on, and the cycle of abuse is often what keeps us questioning whether or not our abusive partners, parents, etc. are really \u201cthat bad\u201d.  I have been in my share of abusive relationships and both of these resources helped to validate and clarify what I was really going through.

I am not remotely upset because my father is horribly emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. However since telling me they are getting a divorce my father has just LOST IT!\n\nMy mum is filing for the divorce because my dad confessed he has been secretly recording her conversations. She has Skype therapy in their home and judging by some of the stuff he has said he has been recording that.\n\nMy father then found an old picture I shared on Facebook of a women laying on a bed, fully clothed, making a stressed out face while covered in lavender. He is absolutely convinced that not only is this women my mum but its some how evidence that she has cheated on him. He said that she showed him bags of lavender and that if she can't remember this then she has lost her mind.\n\nHe also started feeling the walls in a holiday cottage they went too for a weekend away, he said that she put listening devices and secret cameras under the wall paper.\n\nLast week he isolated me and my mother in the back of the business we own and run together and started shouting about how we have to respect him because it's HIS business and she is HIS wife and I am HIS daughter.\n\nThis week he went back to collect some things and took a photo of the blackboard where my mother had written 'unicorns don't poo rainbows' and is claiming that he has taken legal action because this is a 'threat' (if someone could shed some light on what the hell this means that would be great!?)\n\nHe has also used said lavender picture to convince my mother's parents that she is cheating and that I am a lying, manipulative person. Not gonna lie it hurts a bit that my grandparents would believe the man who physically abused their daughter over us. \n\nNow I don't think I'm a particularly nice person to him but that's what you get when you actively and vocally hate your own child because they 'took away your wife's attention.' \n\nThese are just the big things too, every single day there is something that makes me feel sick to my stomach. I am worried about my mothers safety and totally unsure about how I am meant to gather the psychological strength to get through this. Even though it is not directed at me I am stuck in the middle and constantly worrying, because I work with them I feel guilty when I am not there because I know it means they are there alone and he could hurt her. We have contacted the police but there is nothing they can do until it becomes physical. \n\nHe also said that if we posted anything on the internet about this he would take legal action so I'm really quite scared to post this, but I need some logical thought and support. \n\nCan anyone shed some light on all this?

At the start of this year, she had a big crush on me and asked me out. I told her no, I wasn't interested. She then threatened suicide, telling me it was my fault and that me not wanting to date her was causing her suicidal thoughts. I eventually caved, because I didn't want her to kill herself and asked her to homecoming. She immediately became happy and non-suicidal. I had a sleepover with her one night (We're both girls, and my parents didn't know.) and she tried to kiss me on the lips. It made me extremely uncomfortable, but she kept trying to kiss me. Plus, I didn't wanna give my first kiss to someone I didn't love. The day before homecoming, I broke it off with her after suffering an anxiety attack beforehand. She didn't talk to me for a week, and yet again, became suicidal, and telling me it was my fault.\n2. Recently, she'd been manipulative to me, and spread rumors about me behind my back, as well as just generally insulting me around friends and making fun of me for secrets I had that I told her. (I.e. My self-harm issues from a while back, people I like or had liked, and a situation with my mom, another emotionally abusive person in my life.) When I was talking to my current boyfriend about it over a voice call, he offered to ask her to stop on my behalf, as when I had done it in the past, she had threatened suicide. He told her in a message, and was extremely polite about it. A day or so later, after another friend had come forth about their problems with her, she became suicidal yet again, blaming it on mainly me and my friends. I ended up calling her mom and stopping a suicide. She called me and called me names, and said I made her life terrible and wanted her to be alive so I could make fun of her.\n3. When I finally told her I didn't want to be her friend anymore, she agreed, saying she'd heard rumors about me from my friends. She listed off a shit ton of things. For example, one was that I tried to break up relationships or start conflicts for my own personal gain. One said conflict was when she and my current bf who had a crush on her at the time of the \"conflict\" were trying to see if things would work out between them, apparently. At the time of that \"conflict\" however, she said she had no interest in him and did not want to be in a relationship with him. In our conversation, she had also proceeded to say that i tried to break them up so that way I could be with him. This wasn't true, as I was dating someone else at the moment, whom I'm still friends with right now, but at the time I was still in a relationship with him. She, the ex-friend I'm writing about, also said that my friends told her behind my back that I was manipulative and abusive towards them and others. I later checked with my friends about if they said these rumors, and, they'd never said anything of the sort about me behind my back to her, and have known that she is a manipulative person and that she was most likely trying to break my trust in them.\n4. At around the same time of the prior mentioned (#3), she also made up lies about my current bf saying stuff about me behind my back, like that he hated me, that I was manipulative, that I had physically hurt him, that I used him, and that I threatened self-harm when he didn't do what I wanted, and the like. He's never said any of these things to her, and has been my biggest supporter through all of this and so much else. She has tried to break my trust in him before by saying things like this.\n5. She has also been telling friends of hers, and some of my not as close friends secrets from my past and things I try to keep private, as well as sending them old, embarrassing photos of me.\n\nShe's done a lot more to me, some of which is too long to explain concisely, but that's all the big stuff as of this year. Do you guys think I did the right thing? Or have any ideas on how to cope with this and get back to trusting my friends? It's hard to trust people she knows anymore due to this so... I'd appreciate some ideas.  \n\n\nThank you for listening - I needed this.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

The thing is I was about 5 at the time if there's anything everyone remembers about  5 y/o me, it's that I was very curious and had little to no inhibition. So there's a good chance that I could've felt his dick when I was sitting in his lap and grabbed it (although it is weird that it was erect).

I also have no memory of home from the age of 5 to 8, during which time (I've been told) my uncle lived with us. This is despite me having several memories from before that time period so it's not because I was too young to remember. I have seen him again many times afterwards and have never really felt uncomfortable around him. Something I'd like to mention though is that my mom was careful to not let me spend too much time alone with him, despite not being this way with any of our other male relatives.

On the other hand, I do interim assignments during the holidays, which shows that he is, once again, wrong. \n\nAt that moment I raise my voice (I should stay calm on top of that?), explaining that I would not tolerate getting up at 4 a.m. to hear that I am not working enough. T then raises his voice in return, asking me to shut the fuck up and threatening to smack me. I'm 21 years old, he's 46, we both know it would be absolutely illegal.\n\nI proceed by telling him that he\u2019s getting on my nerves. He then immediately shifts by telling me I\u2019m the one getting on *his* nerves (typical DARVO tactic I believe ?)\n\nOn that note, I went to bed. It is very hurtful to live with someone who asks you to take a step towards him, but who advances himself one step as soon as you do, and then blames you for not playing the game. \n\nBut still, I don\u2019t know if this behavior is normal or not.

I sucked up the love bombing despite every effort to remind myself it was just that - hoovering and love bombing. I got too comfortable conversing with him. It almost felt like I only spoke to him because I became suddenly addicted to the drama. Within a few hours. After he got what he wanted (contact, a \u201cfinal chance\u201d) he went back to his usual self and it was like that person he was the other day when he was hoovering and love bombing me was a figment of my imagination. Constant empty words, actions not living up to those words. I\u2019m so confused, so exhausted and hurt. I felt so strong but now I don\u2019t feel so strong anymore. I feel stupid and angry at myself. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to get past this. Cut off contact again and I don\u2019t feel any need to message again, but I still feel so weak. \n\nI feel absolutely stupid for even giving him the time of day. He spewed all of the usual things \u201cI love you\u201d \u201cI want to spend my life with you\u201d \u201cI would do anything to make us work\u201d he told me he would come home to see me this weekend, he isn\u2019t anymore because he\u2019d rather go out with his uni friends. He told me he will take me somewhere warm. He would love me so well. He just wanted one chance to prove it.\n\nAnd he begged me over and over again to give him one last chance, even a couple of days to prove himself. He said \u201cI gave you a chance when you weren\u2019t nice to me over a year ago, please give me one\u201d I kept declining. But eventually gave in and we continued talking.\n\nHe told me he wouldn\u2019t have slept with that woman, and he told her to stop so they didn\u2019t finish, if he wasn\u2019t drunk. \nHe told me he wasn\u2019t going to drink because he\u2019s realised he\u2019s been using it as a coping mechanism to push down his feelings. He went out yesterday with his uni friends and said he didn\u2019t get drunk. He\u2019s going out today and over the weekend and he\u2019s going to get drunk/high like he usually does.\n\nI feel like such an idiot for giving into him and his hoovering. Each message he sent I told myself \u201cthis isn\u2019t true. He doesn\u2019t mean it. He\u2019s just love bombing. He\u2019s hoovering me\u201d I felt so strong. I\u2019ve been feeling so strong the past days before this happened. \n\nHe told me he knows he needs therapy and when he\u2019s back from uni he is going to get it. He wouldn\u2019t leave me alone, no matter how much I begged him to. I threatened to ask his housemate to tell him to leave me alone, and if he kept messaging me I would go to the police. He didn\u2019t stop. I told him he was scaring me and acting obsessive, this wasn\u2019t normal or healthy. I told him he needs help and that he should see a therapist that specialises in narcissism or cluster b pd\u2019s. He said he agrees. \n\nThis month would\u2019ve been our 2 year anniversary. For ages he\u2019s been planning things to do the entire month, and he revealed on Tuesday after his meltdown that he wasn\u2019t even planning on seeing me this summer. Which was new news to me, and new news that he wanted to move on from me in the first place. He went along as though he just needed a bit of time from me, from the arguments. Which I understood. But clearly it wasn\u2019t the case. He said he thought he was over me and that\u2019s why he slept with that girl. He told me he started crying and they stopped, and he said it was \u201ctraumatic\u201d because he realised he wasn\u2019t over me. He told me he was tired of hurting over our relationship. Throughout this he would bring up how he\u2019s given me chances when I\u2019ve been nasty to him. He claims that is the only girl he has slept with. But I\u2019ve seen him grinding on girls on nights out, girls I\u2019ve questioned him about then proceeded to call me deluded and paranoid, saying I need professional help for thinking he was interested in them.  \n\nAs soon as I gave him what he wanted, it was like he never said any of the things he said on Tuesday when he was love bombing me.\n\nI feel so drained and empty and back at square one. I\u2019ve cut him off again. But I don\u2019t feel near as strong as I did a few days ago. I\u2019m at a loss.

His favorite motto when I called him out on doing the thing I did once multiple was \"I wouldn't date myself\". I was 18 when we met in cegep (he was 17 and it was his 1st semester) and I felt like there something great between us. He was the first person I had ever been able to talk to about how I was bullied since 1st grade and how everyone I met eventually harmed me in a way. So for a whole semester I went after him, back then I should've seen all the red flags. Cancelling date like an hour after I went out, constantly teasing me to keep me interested, but telling everyone he didn't like me at all, guilt tripping me for the smallest thing, etc. He used to have a crush on another (who didn't love him at all, but who knew about it) and once, when he invited her to go eat and study, she invited and another girl too (probably to not be alone with him) and he glared at me for the whole time and when I asked, he said it's because I interrupted his \"date\" with her. \nWe started dating after one day during winter when I went all to way to his neighborhood. There was a fucking blizzard, but we couldn't go at his place cause his mom was here. We spent like 3h kissing under the snow. When I got home, I finally asked him if it meant that we were dating. Then he said \"Idk I feel like it's more sexual? Let's just be fuck friends\". I was kinda shocked, of course I said no cause I didn't want that, then a few hours later he changed his answer to yes we were dating, but in secret. We then dated on secret (hiding it from all the member of the club we were in) during like 8-9 month. During those month he wasn't especially bad and we didn't really have much problem, but it's after we started telling others that he showed his colors.\nI have social phobia, am very shy and didn't like myself, at all. I hated and still hate confrontation and love to compromise when I can, but most of the time if it's not too important I'm ready to give up cause I don't see the point in fighting. While we were dating for the 9 first month, he made me feel like I could be more open, talk to people more and make friends. I felt like a new person and wanted to meet new people and discover new things. He basically made me go out of my shell a bit more.\nWhile we were dating my nex, on multiple occasion, would be pissed and judge me for saying that another guys is good looking (can be understandable to some extend), but he would stare at other girls chest and ass just to turn around and tell me \"Look she isn't wearing any bra\" or \" Look at her ass, she isn't wearing panties\". I didn't it bother me at 1st. \nWith our group of friends (we had pretty much every of our friends in common including our best-friend which I'll call Cri-cri), we would often hang out to china-town, nice asian restaurant, etc. I loved to go out, but him, not as much. There happened a few times when our friends would go out multiple days a week, but he didn't like that and would rather stay home. I still wanted to go, but he would guilt trip me into not going or give me some kinda curfew (like I should leave the place 8pm). It made me sad, but I'm fairly submissive and I didn't know how to fight it. He would also, by example, not txt me for a few hours because he was doing smtg, but as soon as I didn't txt him, I didn't care about him and was ignoring. We had the habit of txting hi to each other every morning, but at a certain moment it became just me sending hi and him replying, he would never send it first, but if I didn't he would complain that was already awake since 45min while he had been up for the last 3h. We would often have dispute where it would be him telling how wrong I am and maybe we aren\"t made for each other and me constantly apologizing cause I \"didn't't mean what I did\". \nWhen we started dating, he had a job, but gave it up cause it was too hard. All the money had saved up, he kept it to save it. Whenever we would go out, I would pay, but if I wanted him to pay me back half of the 50$ breakfast bill, I had to ask him \"5 working days\" in advance just so he could cancel the date cause he didn't have the money. Instead of him buying a monthly bus pass, I would have to pay 9.75$ to go see him everytime cause we didn't live in the same city. The worst thing he would do is start touching me inappropriately while in public, when I tell him to stop, he guilt trip me and tell me I never wanna do anything, when I let him, buy don't react to it (cause we in front of all of our friends), he guilt trip me and complains that I don't react when he touched me. Once I had to complain for 10min cause I didn't want to do anything since we were staying at a friends house with like 4-5 other ppl and the bedroom door had a damn window. Still guilt tripped me.\nAfter 9month into our relationship, a new semester start and a girl with probably every anxiety disorder in the book shows up, she clearly has a crush on N, but I didn't feel threatened. She would often have panic attack in the clubroom and everyone would swarm around her. My Nex, who gets close to everyone rlly fast thanks to his snake tongue, got close to her, started txting her a lot and from than on wood have a heart attack whenever I touched his phone even if I used to be able to go on it all the time, so I did the same he and even called me out guilt tripping me and the said \"I wouldn't date myself\". I started falling out of love quickly but didn't know what to do, so I just stayed. A new semester start, it's my hardest so far, more internship (I'm a nurse). He starts to feel lonely he says, so he starts hanging out more with the girl (I'll call her Tool, cause she had no personality and my Nex probably only want to date her cause she would never refuse anything of refute him). Tool and N start to hug a lot cuddle on the couch. So of course, I complain to my Nex, he says \"I was lonely and needed someone while you were always at your internship\". I'm like, ok... I suck it in, but during the same semester I had complain at least 10 times everytime, I had to suck it in. I finished my internship and try to spend more time with him but he ignore me for Tool, when I hug him, she's holding her hand, when I kiss him, she's hugging him. When I try to assert myself, she gets depress and my Nex guilt trip me. I'm starting to be really depressed and I'm always sad, but he doesn't care, because he is also depressed and he is more important. I had a period where I was so off that I didn't eat for 5days. One day, he stayed on the phone with me for a few hours. Not talking, just there. The presence made me think less about throwing myself in front of the bus. The next day, after an hour he hanged up because my silence made him uncomfortable, the days after, I wouldn't call.\nIn december this year, I had gone in a trip for 2 weeks, just before a friends of ours wanted to give me a christmas gift before I left ( I left the 22nd) so he proposed to go to mcdo, we could meet, eat and I get the gift. My Nex was mad, but I'm pretty dense so I couldn't get why. I just wanted to see a friends and get chocolate to eaton the plane. He said that food was smtg that brought us together and I should not go eat with anyone else (cause he feared I would fall in love with them or smtg) and that the friends also apologized when he understood that he had proposed me to go grab a bite. My Nex said that I didn't know that friend well enough to be so close to him (I had known him for a semester already). It's after my trip that he started getting way to close to Tool (who he had known for a semester too).\nTool had spend 2 semester lying to her parents about going to her classes. Her dad would always drive her to school just so she can spend the day cuddling with my Nex and have panic attack about everything. She even made them pay for both semester. She would give up on every assignment like 3 weeks before they were due and cry about how she doesn't have any time for it. When she said it to her parents, she had to stop coming to school, those were some great 2 month without her. My Nex actually giving me attention and even asking me help for his project in programming (I would help designing maps for his game and my maps were gorgeous). Semester ended, we get into the summer.\nSince I was fairly introverted, for yeats I had been spending my free time in my imagination. I had created a cery complex world that I was proud of and my Nex proposed to make it a game. I was so hype I said yes. First few weeks, we lay all the information about the world, characters, etc in a doc, then we start on about game mechanics while still modifying parts of the story along with it. He made some pretty good modification to it, but would sometimes what to modify things I wanted to keep. Then we would argue, raise the volume, then hang up and not call until I apologized for what happened. After a while of it happening, I started telling him \"Hey, there's not point in continuing cause we are going to yell at each other and it won't bring anything), but instead of just agreeing, he would say \"Stop saying that, you make it seem like I'm always the problem\" or smtg like that. Then we start talking less, because he was uncomfortable talking with someone we could break a fuse like that. ( I admit, I used to break fuse easily against my pc a year prior, but had stopped when he mentioned it)\nHe then started a youtube channel, so he would have smtg to do to not talk to me\n Since he would always prevent me from making friends, I had no else to talk to except him, so when he started ignoring, I became extremely depressed, wanting to hurt myself really badly just to have smtg happen in my day (not for attention, just because I was extremely depressed and needed smtg to change my mind). He kept ignoring me even after I said that, but whenever we would go out, I still have to always pay and be the one to go. \nIn august we would go to the otakuthon with our friends, but this year his parents wanted to go on a trip. He was able to convince them to stay, but his mom being a witch (it's a fact btw, she destroyed a couch with a knife cause his dad punished his brother for bad grades) decided to not do the groceries for him. Guess who spent the last 80$ she had in bank till the end of the month on food for him?\nThen after the otakuthon, was the Matsuri festival. When we were there I mentioned him how I had been feeling during the whole summer and he said (I wish I was joking) : \" Yea, well guess how I had been feeling? I'm having fun al day, gaming and recording videos for my youtube channel, but I always have to stress about the fact that I'm not giving you all of my attention, so I can't enjoy myself\". It bothered me so much, cause he was the one who would leave me behind for tool cause I made him feel \"lonely' because of my internship even though I was always txting him and spend all my free time go to see him. But as usual I just sucked it in. At he end of the summer, he decided to break up with me. One day before the start of the new semester. I accepted, but he decided that instead of a break up, to take a pause (To him, this meant to keep doing everything a couple do, except kissing and anything sexual). I was still depressed, I couldn't enjoy myself with my friends like I used to, but he didn't care because :\n- \"Yea I know that you're sad, but I also am really depressed, so could you at least act happy when I'm here so I wouldn't be sad?\" -\nThis semester, I had decided to try to get new friends among the freshman, I did a good 1st impression since I was the coordinator of the comity (I spent a lot of energy on the club, created activities and even a way of making money for the club. Would always be there for everyone and since I was sensitive to others emotion, I would often quickly give a shoulder to cry). I met a freshman I will call ADHD boy, cause he was the very definition of adhd, he once spent 5 hours trying to get out of the house, but wasn't able to concentrate enough to get dressed and leave cause he didn't take his medication. We clicked pretty fast and he even introduced me to BTS, since he was a huge fan of them. My Nex (we were still on pause) liked him a lot since he was also in programming. As soon as I started getting close to ADHD boy though my Nex started being a bitch about everything. My Nex was an exec in the club, so me and him had talked about giving a key to ADHD boy. When I gave the key, 2 days laters when ppl complained and asked why he had one (It was my fault though cause I had forgotten to tell the other exec), instead of saying that we had discussed it, he basically said that it wasn't him and that it was my fault because he wanted ppl to be sure that I was biased toward ADHD boy and that ppl would hate him. No one hated him, but everyone was sure that I was biased. ADHD boy started feeling really depressed because of how Nex was and even contemplate quitting the club even after mentioning how safe and happy he felt there. I was constantly depressed, I wasn't able to smile anymore and I was contemplating killing myself already at that point, plus it was going terrible at home at that time. I'm also very bad at expressing  how I feel, so I usually show it a lot in my behavior and ppl quickly get it and ask me, but not now cause my Nex had told everyone that \"I needed space\" whenever they asked him what was wrong with me (since ppl preferred asking him instead of me like I didn't have a voice or a body of my own. So even the person I considered my best-friend, Cri-cri, didn't even care. One day, I had told a girl I was fairly close to how depressed I am and she saw the cuts on my arms, but I didn't want to be bothered or to bother anyone so I hid somewhere in the school while waiting for my exam. It's only at this moment that Cri-cri actually tried to look for me, but I was too sad and depresses and didn't want to see him since he had never had the time for me till then so I told him to leave cause I didn't want to see him. At some point, I didn't even have the energy to be with anyone, I would skip my nursing class and avoid everyone. I was diagnosed with major depression which is probably due to a culmination of all my years of never being able to have real friends, bullying and always being abandoned topped by what was happening.\nNo one cared aside from 3 ppl I think, but I still felt alone and empty, mostly because my Nex had made sure that the friendships and the place I had build in the club would be lost. No one there care about me and I felt utterly betrayed by that, even though I had always done all I could for them. Then for the last month of school, I spent it sleeping, studying and sitting at school while skipping my classes. With no one, because there was no one to be with. Two of the ppl who still cared had better things to do since they were both in another club and the other person was in university.\nSince then I've been working, sleeping and eating. I cut contact with everyone that was a common friend with me and Nex ( which means everyone I knew in cegep) I have no friends (even though I try to make some via social media, but I'm a very personality person so it's hard to like someone I haven't met yet) and I'm still trying to fight my sadness and loneliness to this day.\nThank you to anyone who read that, That was kind of an hectic wreck, but I felt like I had to tell somewhere that would not be biased by my Nex words and I thought it was the best place. \nThank you again for lending me your kind ears and have a lovely day \u2661", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don\u2019t remember much of what happened after, only that same \u201cfriend\u201d (who asked me if it was really rape) walking in on it happening and closing the door immediately after. \nWith the \u201canniversary\u201d(I guess that\u2019s the word for it) a few days away, I find myself sad and angry all over again. I constantly go back and forth with myself thinking that I shouldn\u2019t feel like this because others have it so much worse but my body was violated by somebody I trusted and loved and I still can\u2019t seem to get over it. \n\nDoes anybody have any advice on making peace with your past and steps on how to fully move on? I am no longer with him, I current have a wonderful boyfriend and I am truly happy being with him but i don\u2019t want to bring this up because I know he won\u2019t really know what to say. I just can\u2019t currently seem to shake this feeling and guilt for even thinking about this still. Any and all wisdom is appreciated, thanks for reading my mini rant.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Then at 13 we moved in with him. He remained normal until i got in trouble at school a few times and he disagreed with my moms punishment (normal grounding stuff no tv/phone/games) and said if he were my dad he would take the door off the hinges, take my phone/tv away completely until i knew how to act.\n\nThat just caused me to not to like him hut nothing crazy was happening yet. He did make me write 1000 sentences a lot as a form of punishment and if I didn\u2019t get them done he said he would empty my room out and give me only a bed and a blanket. \n\nThen at 14 it really hammered in. He became obsessed with what i wore and who i was with. He would say i \u201cdress slutty to get guys attention\u201d mind you i wore jeans and maybe a tight shirt but nothing showing. But he constantly accused me of being a slut and sleeping around when i had never even kissed a boy. He would tell my mom i was lazy and pathetic when I became depressed. He said i was a selfish little shit when I attempted to take my life at 15. He became this raging monster.\n\nHe would come into my room and just sit on my bed. Not leaving for hours and it would sometimes be at like midnight. He would pick fights and then tell me how selfish I am and how much i hurt my mom by how ungrateful and pathetic i am. He had come into my room on several occasions just to yell and rant about me for no reason. \n\nThen he began slapping my ass. Telling me i was my mom 2.0 but younger. Would be furious if i went on dates. Mad when i got my first boyfriend. Hated him, hated every guy i was ever with. Continued calling me a little slut. Ive even woken up a few nights to him just staring at me as a sleep while he sits on my bed.\n\nPhysically he has yanked on my arms. Hair and pushed me but nothin harsh. \n\nI moved out two years ago and it never got better. He just would text me terrible things. Call me 5-10 times in a row at late hours. Forced me to have a tracker on my phone. And constantly said i was going to get rapped bc im a slut. \n\nHe has bought me many \u201cgifts\u201d he uses as ways to make me shut up or do what he wants. Such as my car, tv and games and clothes. He always threatens to come to my place and take everything including the car. \n\nWould this be viewed by others as abuse. Im 21 now. So from 13-21. I just want to leave him behind. I recently moved to a location where he doesn\u2019t know where i am. I will be getting my own car and returning the one he bought me to him.

I have him thoroughly blocked everywhere, but ~8 months ago I started noticing a finsta watching all my Instagram stories \u2014 private acct, no name listed, follows one person, has zero followers, and the username is a composite of a random friend of mine\u2019s last name and area code. I asked the random friend if he knew who this user was and he said no. \n\nThis account was viewing my shit nearly every day. I know it\u2019s my nex \u2014 who else could it possibly be, honestly \u2014 though I keep that quiet to most of my friends so they don\u2019t think I\u2019m paranoid and psychotic, since i haven\u2019t spoken to him in 3+ years. After I called it out in a tweet \u2014 which my nex also should not have been able to see, but maybe did? \u2014 the stalking stopped for about 6 months. I forgot to block the account because it stopped. But it just picked up again. He\u2019s viewing my stories *several times a day.* And I think it\u2019s a hoovering ramp up leading to the wedding in 3 weeks, where we will see each other.\n\nI need to block the finsta, but I....don\u2019t want to? I want to know to what extent he\u2019s still trying to be up my ass, for some reason. It\u2019s like, almost satisfying, in a way that\u2019s twisted. I have to block it!!!!! But i haven\u2019t yet. Also my account is public so he can just make another one and do it again. Ugh. Looking for ppl to hold me accountable and make me block it. \n\nALSO: I went to LENGTHS to find out if it was him. Still sort of inconclusive, but i polled a bunch of friends to see if the finsta username shows up in their \u201cpeople you might know\u201d tab on Instagram.

I was young and didn\u2019t know as much. But I was isolated from family (moved to another city), they convinced me of all these horrible things about my family so I didn\u2019t talk to them, told me I didn\u2019t need to work so I was financially dependent\u2014all the classic signs. I was there through thick and thin. When we dirt poor, only had my car to share, etc.That person left me for another girl\u2014was talking to her before they dumped me. Then dropped me on my face and was unbelievably cruel but still kept me at arms length for almost a year. It took me 3 years to crawl out the depression it left me in. I lost around 40lbs and I moved back home to put my life back together. \n\nI stayed single for 3 years. It was really good for me. I was confident, self sufficient, finished my bachelors, lived on my own, had a good job, bought a brand new car. I was in the best shape of my life\u2014I worked out and ate clean and I was happy. I knew exactly what I wanted and didn\u2019t want in a relationship and I was perfectly content to be single until I found it. \n\nFast forward to now, I\u2019m going through a break with my bf of 4 years. We have a 19m daughter and a house together. Same scenario, unfortunately because it takes twice for my life to be turned upside down before I learn. When we met, I knew that first month that I needed to run away. There were day many red flags so early on. So I did. I said I\u2019d had enough and then ghosted him in every aspect. For a solid month he blew up my phone, left voicemails, called my work phone, messaged, text, contacted my sisters on his behalf and even stopped by my house one night and dropped on orchids. It really freaked me out because it\u2019d only been a month and he talked about how much he loved me and wanted to please talk and apologize. Eventually, I gave in and we\u2019d been together ever since. He was emotionally abusive under the guise of utmost honesty. He\u2019d call me a million names any time he got upset. Disagreements were screaming matches. When we had a fight and I tried to leave for space, he\u2019d follow me and block my exit. He\u2019d grab my arms and left bruises. One time he slapped me. Several times he\u2019d slam on the breaks in the care and I\u2019d fly forward into the dash because it wasn\u2019t expected. He convinced me I had the issues. I was too emotional. I was over reacting. I actually started seeing a therapist because I sincerely thought perhaps I was the problem. The entire entire I knew him, he was fighting to see his son. His ex had filed a restraining order against him and so he didn\u2019t see his son anymore either. He spun it like \u201cshe\u2019s just bitter because I don\u2019t want to date her anymore, that\u2019s why she\u2019s doing this\u201d and I fell for it. I was at every single court date. I missed work to be there at court with him sometimes. I bailed him out of jail when his ex filed 2 bogus restraining order violations. I was there to do everything for him when the second violation landed him in house arrest. I was unwavering. I never even met this kid. All his financial struggles, I was there. Then I was 8 months pregnant and he wanted to move a girl into our carriage house. I was fine with it, we needed and tenant and she was essentially a perfect stranger. But then he told me he had feelings for her. I was devastated. I knew he had this romanticized idea of polygamy when I met him but I was adamant that I wasn\u2019t on board. Why would he bring it up when I\u2019m in my most vulnerable state? At first things were ok. The three of us were friendly with one another\u2014and I mean that completely platonically. Then she slowly stopped talking to me but kept talking to him. It bothered me and I told him. He basically defended her and dismissed me. Said I was the only one who felt that way. I\u2019m overreacting. I told him if it was going to continue that she needed to move. He said no. Longer story short, it took 7 months and the threat of a formal eviction to get her out. I left my house for a bit thinking he\u2019d care and snap out of it, he never did. I\u2019d ask for a talk so we could work things out but he never gave me the time of day. He was too busy. He keeps on contact with her still. And he broke up with me. I was \u201ctoo mean\u201d and he was just so unhappy. So now I\u2019m living in the carriage house and he\u2019s living in the basement apartment of our home. I\u2019m tormented by it but I don\u2019t have much choice right now. I\u2019m absolutely gutted about everything. I know deep down that it\u2019s best. Who knows when I would\u2019ve had the balls to leave on my own. But I just had this whole life I thought I was going to have and now it\u2019s gone. For the second time now I\u2019ve been dropped on my face after giving my absolute all to a narcissistic asshole. I feel so incredibly guilty for my daughter. I never wanted a broken home for her. I feel myself spiraling again like I did the first time. I have no appetite. I\u2019m so incredibly sad. We\u2019ve been living separately for 7 months now but I only feel worse. The other day we had an argument and he said that he wished I would die. He called me fat. Everything that\u2019s actually wrong with him is what he accuses me of. I still see that same therapist\u2014it\u2019s been 3 years now. She keeps assuring me that it\u2019s not actually me but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not still a mind fuck sometimes. Some days are ok, and I can understand that he\u2019s just a fuck. But most days are hard. And sad. And I can\u2019t fathom how this could happen to me twice. Why do I deserve this twice? I can\u2019t fall apart because I have to be stronger for my daughters sake but I don\u2019t know how to hold myself together either. I want to move away but I can\u2019t get out of this house yet. But I know it\u2019s the only thing that\u2019ll allow me to start healing. I wish I could just cut him out of my life entirely but I can\u2019t because we share a kid. I could just disappear but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to deprive her. She loves her dad. H don\u2019t want to be vindictive using her as a pawn. I\u2019m trying to so hard for her but I can\u2019t continue this 50/50 arrangement if it\u2019s going to continue to destroy me mentally and emotionally to deal with him in any capacity. I just don\u2019t know what to do. I feel like I\u2019m losing myself.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Not that I should be relying on reddit anyway.\n\nI\u2019m a survivor of CSA(childhood sexual abuse) by one of my  older brothers, who in turn made the two below him help. This happened while he was between 11-15 and maybe older, and I was between the ages of  5-8. For context, my family found out once and beat the shit out of him one from our mom (bio) and my adoptive mom. (My bio mom was on a lot of drugs and didn\u2019t have custody of her kids for a majority of the time, not until my little brother was born did she get her act together and try to get all her kids back, but she couldn\u2019t get me back.)So then he got caught the second time when I was 8 or 9, after I had moved to a different city 5 hrs away, and again got the shit beat out of him and had to live with someone who had no minors in the house.PS: everything I went through happens to my little brother too. I\u2019ve recently gone to mental health about this because(we\u2019ll call him D)D has been very persistent about me talking to him and forgiving him for everything, but that\u2019s not what I want to do because I\u2019m still very hurt by it. The reason I\u2019m posting this is because it seems that all of my biological family is siding with him, saying I should accept his apology, and I hurts a lot. I love my bio mom, but when she disregards everything that happened and tries to cast it into the void to be forgotten, it feels like the feelings aren\u2019t mutual. \n\nBio mom: BM\nAdoptive mom:mom\nAdoptive sisters: s1 and sisters (they will be mentioned in a group setting\nD: dirtbag molester\n\nHere\u2019s a situation: my s1 had a wedding recently, D was invited because BM isn\u2019t the richest person and can\u2019t get to Vegas where it was by herself. The predetermined agreement was that D would stay on the other side of the room away from me, as BM and mom discussed prior. BUT NO, D had the audacity to make a beeline for me when I walked in to try and give me a hug, mind you we haven\u2019t even talked about anything because I can\u2019t stand him, I was only compromising for my mom. I say no thank you and back away, not before one of his hands brush my arm and I get kinda triggered by it but maybe I\u2019m over reacting. Mind you I am with my sisters, huddled in a big gathering because we were the bridesmaids getting ready to walk out. It seemed like none of them noticed but my mom did, she said I could have handled it better and just said hi or something but she doesn\u2019t blame me, she agrees with me, for him to come and confront me like that was wrong since he knows how I feel. I feel like I\u2019ve already disowned him as a brother. \n\nHere\u2019s where I need advice on a couple things.\n\n1) I can\u2019t look at pictures of myself as a kid because I just get sad, I feel like it was stolen from me by him. The memories were so traumatic my brain pushed everything down, including the good things. Is that even a normal thing to feel?\n2) my family is planning a family reunion to cherish my grandmother because she\u2019s down so much I guess, but that includes him going. I\u2019m willing to compromise again, stay on the other side of the room and leave me alone. Am I being dumb? Am I being to naive? We\u2019ll be on an island but all of my adoptive family will be there to comfort and protect me if anything happens. \n3) something I haven\u2019t told anyone but my boyfriend because it directly impacts him. I grew up seeing on social media that oral sex was a norm in a relationship. I can\u2019t do it though without feeling my body dissociate and having a panic attack because that\u2019s my most vivid memory of the abuse. I feel like I take an experience away from my boyfriend, what if he leaves me because I\u2019m too complicated because all of the things that trigger me with being intimate? \n\nI\u2019ll end this post here and reply as people see it, literally cried typing all of it because of how it\u2019s affecting my life and relationships. I can\u2019t call my bio sister without her bringing up talking to him and that I should forgive and that it\u2019s Christian like to forgive. I\u2019m not even religious, and I\u2019m hiding it from my family. Btw I\u2019m 21 now and serving in the military, this is not affecting my work (easy job hard to mess up) the only thing this messes with in my career is PT, the depression gets bad and I just lay in bed all day after work, then go to bed at 10.

I keep finding these bits of truth that hint at lies she has made, but every time I confront her about these things, I seem to get the following pattern:\n\n1. She questions the facts themselves, when I have evidence to back it up (\"that's not true, I wasn't there at that time, you must have it wrong\")\n2. When I verify the evidence is correct, some sort of lame/illogical/mean explanation (\"I said that because I just didn't want to talk to you\")\n3. Calling me crazy for fabricating the whole thing in the first place (\"why do you want this to be true? why do you not want to trust me\")\n4. Asking me why she would lie about something so trivial, or why I would care about something so trivial (\"I can't believe we are fighting over a stupid facebook post\")\n5. Once, when cornered, she admitted the lie and gave an excuse based on her childhood abuse.   \n\n\nBut for the most part I've only gotten through stages 1-4 on the items of concern. The lies I am accusing her of seem pretty straightforward and fit into the larger context of her other lies, so it seems like we're just living in two different realities most of the time. I'm just really having a hard time with the absolute steadfastness of her insisting her truthiness. Through therapy the waves of self doubt are subsiding, but this is just such a difficult situation to be in.\n\nMy personal therapist tells me that she may not even have access to the truth, or know that she told a lie. That her reality is possibly so fungible that she doesn't even really know if she did or didn't lie, but regardless doesn't want to be seen as a liar.\n\nI guess I still hold out some (irrational?) hope that if she can just admit a lie was made, maybe we can start to peel back the shell covering up the hurt little girl I just know is inside, and perhaps make some progress.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was forced to apologize for the things he disapproved of; my taste in music, art, friends, family, appearance, philosophies, diet (I was vegetarian for nearly a decade before meeting him); and tiptoed on eggshells as to not displease him.\n\nIn January 2018, after an argument where he pushed me backwards to the ground, I told him he needed to move out. The next morning, gripped with fear about what my reality would be like without him, I begged him to stay. In true Narcissistic fashion, he said him leaving was my fault.\n\nThe realization that I had been in an abusive relationship didn\u2019t hit me until after it ended;  I was in denial. As I began to recognize the abuse, I became vocal about his tendencies on social media, alerting the women in my circle about his behavior and habits.\nWord got around, his band got kicked off a bill when it came out that he was an abuser, and he retaliated.\n\nA year later, after many of back-and-forth exchanges, most of them phone conversations to the tune of the  narcissistic and co-dependent dynamic, I receive a summons to appear in court because he is petitioning for a restraining order against me. \n\nThe timing of his petition aligned with his band officially getting booted from the bill. When he posted a lengthy response on social media to my warnings of abuse, a user asked if he feared for his physical safety. His response: \u201cNo, I just want my name protected\u201d.  Restraining orders are for people who feel physically threatened by another, not as a way to control what someone else says about them. For him, an abuser, to manipulate a system meant to protect victims is appalling.\n\nI asked for a continuance and the court date was postponed; I go to court next Wednesday.\n\nLast time we saw each other in court, he rolled up with a posse of 5 friends who I\u2019ve never saw eye to eye with; how they\u2019d jump at a chance to cut me down. I showed up with my mom, who is deaf, and would only be able to testify about the body language she witnessed, and the change in my demeanor over the years.\n\nI\u2019ve been loosing sleep about the upcoming court date and find myself leaning towards signing a stay-away agreement instead of going to trial because I\u2019m terrified of that friend group testifying against me. I feel outnumbered and am incredibly sensitive to criticism related to the trauma. I\u2019m scared that negative comments about me will unravel the work I\u2019ve done in therapy for the past year.\n\nThis restraining order makes me like I\u2019m still being terrorized by him, even though we haven\u2019t been together in 18 months.\n\nSuggestions on how to face this?

And when she was accusing me of being a stalker she was using my screename for the community we were both in, not my real name, so I didn't feel like I had a solid complaint to make. \n\nThe really shit thing about all this is my local police force aren't even the ones handling it, my ex's are and they're hour and a half away\n\nIn England you can only be bailed out for 28 days, they told me they wont even be able to look at my laptop and phone in that time, so despite having terrible travel anxiety they want me travel an hour and a half just for them to be like \"lol yeah we haven't even looked, come back in a month\"\n\nI've got a solicitor since, I didn't ask for one for my interview because I was scared I'd have to wait longer and I couldn't face another hour in the cell; I also had nothing I was worried about talking about or slipping up on because I haven't done anything, so I didn't see the point \n\nMy solicitor is trying to get them to move the bail to a local police station, my doctor has written me a note so I'm praying I don't have to go \n\nAnother totally shit thing is part of my bail is not to contact her, no problem at all, but if she gets an anonymous horrible message (which she gets from people all the time because she is semi-internet famous) she can just call up the police and say \"hey I got a message, I think it could be from my ex! :O\" they can just come arrest me again, take my phone and laptop again (which I just bought new ones because I need them for work) and I will be locked up again\n\nUntil they check my electrical devices and see I didn't do anything I'm the one in limbo having to live in fear, every time a car pulls up outside I'm scared it's going to be the police\n\nI'm just praying they will clear me soon and I can forget all this and move on with my life, id been doing so well, id been working out feeling the healthiest I had for years, work was good, I was feeling very positive and now my life feels derailed until this is sorted out \n\nI just want to be able to move on and leave this all behind and start life again", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It\u2019s a true addiction to hurt and lie and cause chaos. I have no idea what drives me to do this but afterwards the guilt eats me alive. I look back and think why am I like this and why do I do these things? I pray you find someone to treat you the way you deserve. It was never you in any of those situations, it was all me.

He has become emotionally abusive to me. He is easily enraged, blames me for everything, and harshly criticizes me regularly.  He has done some physical things like threatening to throw heavy objects across the room, lunging into my face while yelling at me (without touching me), and storm around the house so that, if you don\u2019t jump out of his way, he will collide with you. He has also refused to help me when I have been injured (e.g., I hurt my thumb, needed to go to ER, couldn't tie my shoe, and he wouldn't tie it for me).

So far he has just gotten irritable with them, at which point I step in. \n\nI have met with a lawyer and where I live, his behavior is not considered physical abuse and it\u2019s not enough to get a restraining order. Also, this type of emotional abuse is not enough to really affect custody decisions. I understand that courts usually assign shorter, more frequent visits to children under 2.5 or 3, but I don\u2019t know if I could get the same arrangement for my 4-year-old, and even if I could, it would expire at some point.

It would be worth getting hit to have a safe way to exit this with my children, but I\u2019m not sure the best way to provoke him.

Haha he would never cope. I seriously live to see him fail miserably with them because it isn't all about playing, like he thinks it is.

Its us who pick a kiwi over an apple or apple over a banana or just one of those in particular.\nWhy? \nWe pick what we think is good for us or what we feel like.\nIf this sounds out of logic then I think we need to dig deeper into our own behavior and psyche.\nWe were taught, sometime in the past that we should accept the treatment we're given.\nThis is why most empaths have reocurring troubled relationships until they come to the core of the problem.\nIm by no means a psychologist but going through a very rough relationship and experiencing all above I relaized what exactly all people I have similar trouble with and there is not many - have in common. \nMe and my compliance to their treatment or adjustability to their behavior.\n\nIn the beginning of the relationship I spoke to a therapist once and she opened my eyes so blissfully - she said \"ok we got to the point why are they the way they are but I wanna see what is it that makes you make yourself adjusted to that, to compromise and comply to all of that\".\n\nI never spoke to her again but it took about 2y for me to realise where she was coming from and I did all the work by foot - I know now I was somwhow taught/programmed/ made to believe that my needs are not as #1 as the other party's, my feelings are accepted only if that works for the other party, my reality exists only of it's what the other party needs or wants to hear and finally and ultimately that I am no worth of deserving the best, that every good thing is a reward and not a normal positive state and that in order to be treated good I have to deserve it and prove my worth.\n\nWell life is given to all of us to live it proudly righteously and equally. \nNoone should make you feel less, not enough, wrong or play deaf when you have something to say. It is so important to tell ourselves every day that we deserve love respect and to feel good just by being a kind rightminded and nice person.\n\nNoone should ever tell us being emotional and having and showing emotions for something is wrong.\n\nWe're all given the same life and we all deserve to live it in peace and that is why WE have to choose who are we letting in our lives and how much we give them.\n\nThey don't pick us, we pick them because we think they and treir treatment is good or good enough for us.\n\nSince I started thinking this way, I started realizing many of those problems can be sloved because the answer is in me. \nWe can't and should never change anyone. \nTheir actions speak louder than words and we can only change ourselves. Put a healthy boundary because healthy boundaries create mutual respect and base of any friendship, or relationship.\n\nI hope this helps someone struggling and thinking why do those things happen or repeat and when will that stop.\n\nThe answer is the very second WE decide that.\n\nIt helped me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I feel this would be the right place to go. A good few months back some dramas happened online that I believe led to me acting narcissistically. An ex-friend probably a decade older than me accused me of being a narcissist. Big long hate-speech I counteracted with one of my own. I was quite petty back then. But since after losing a bunch of friends online it's been in my head. What if she was right, what if I was a narcissist, what if I'm a monster? Honestly it's driven me a little insane, I've tried my best since maybe the beginning of January to fix this problem or find out if I really have one in the first place. I've asked family, friends and have looked for support via the local Headspace. So far no one seems to think I am. But I can't help but see the selfishness in many of my actions still despite being told I'm not numerous times. There's no use harming myself over it, as it seems apparent I might not be one. Logically I understand, but emotionally a partof me can't get a grip around it. So I'm asking please if anyone would be generous enough to give me some advice and support in accepting I'm not.

I\u2019m in my late 20s and she\u2019s in her early 30s. We have been together for almost 6 years as of July. Tonight has been a very rough night for me and I just feel kind of helpless and want to express myself to anyone at this point. I love her with all my heart and despite the bad I do still try to focus on the good. She and I both have our own problems with alcohol, I\u2019m definitely doing a lot better but I wouldn\u2019t call myself sober. When she drinks she enters this loop that always results in verbal, emotional, and at times physical abuse. As soon as she cracks open her first bottle I get filled with anxiety because I never know who I am going to get and more often than not it\u2019s hardly ever good. She often gaslights me when she\u2019s intoxicated, about a year and a half ago I broke down and poured my heart out begging her to stop. Before that moment she did not know what gaslighting was, but ever since then she\u2019s added it to her arsenal to attack and belittle me. Tonight I was sober while she was not, everything was fine and I was having an okay night keeping to myself. I have just tried to keep my distance lately when she drinks these days because the less opportunity for a small misunderstanding to blow up into something much worse is kept to a minimum. I often stay in the living room she often stays in the bedroom. Tonight she came in the living room and we were having a dumb conversation, nothing serious just small talk. The cycle began here, this is what happens every time, I began to say something only to not finish my entire statement before it becomes taken completely out of context. Again this is just small talk, I\u2019m not making an controversial statements. She proceeds to cut off what I\u2019ve said and flip it, then I spend my time trying to clarify what I was saying. She starts accusing me of cutting her off and I let her talk even though she cut me off in the first place. Once she finishes whatever rant she goes on, I proceed to try and talk again only to be cut off again and then accused of cutting her off, she gets more angry for me trying to get a word in and diffuse the situation. Eventually I put my foot down and sometimes I get angry I\u2019m human I cannot help it. This only ever makes things worse, now comes the insults and threats of physical violence. I take these threats very seriously and in the past she has punched/kicked/slapped/spit on/ me, when it gets to this level I record it with audio/video because in the past I\u2019ve defended myself with a stiff arm to maintain my personal space, a push, or a hold and she\u2019s immediately played the victim screaming for help. She fully takes advantage of the fact that I am a man and trying to get me to harm her. She will proceed insult my masculinity because I don\u2019t do anything. Eventually some distance is found, we go our separate way. Time will pass and she will approach me like literally nothing happened, I\u2019m very upset and she knows it or is that far gone she doesn\u2019t realize what happened earlier. My body language is understandably not the most welcoming at that point, I\u2019m short and don\u2019t want to talk really. Tonight for example she came into my space as if nothing had happened, so I asked her if she was just going to pretend everything is all good? Immediately she\u2019s fired up again, begins screaming and I stand my ground I wanted my answer. I never got it... go back to be by myself, again acts like it\u2019s all good. Begins to talk about something in her work life she\u2019s upset about, I listen for a while and offer a different perspective. She did not like this and proceeded to scream and yell again. She has since gone silent and I think she\u2019s asleep now, and I\u2019m sure she will wake up in the morning to act like nothing happened because that\u2019s the way it goes. This same thing happens every single night, it\u2019s an endless cycle that I try so hard not to get sucked into and she acts like oh I was drunk lol but it\u2019s so calculated sometimes it\u2019s scary. She has BPD and I try my best to be understanding of this, but honestly I feel like I\u2019m just enabling this behavior. This has been getting worse and worse, happening more frequently. It used to be an occasional thing, maybe once a week sometimes twice but it\u2019s now becoming a loop you could set your watch to. I decided that tomorrow morning I am going to tell her it\u2019s the alcohol or me and if she chooses the alcohol I\u2019m going to put my furniture and electronics in storage and live in my car until I can find someplace else to live. I\u2019m so scared that I know what the answer will be and it breaks my fucking heart.

He tormented me, got off on putting me in physical or psychological pain, and did everything in his power to drive me to suicide (just like he told me he would; I just had thought it was some kind of sick joke at the time.) But he didn't win, I'm alive. So yay for me! I've defeated a psychopath who tried to kill me off. That's what my therapist bluntly told me last month, and accepting that fact has been very healing and clarifying.\n\nThere was a really sneaky hoover attempt recently, but I made myself invisible. He has no idea where I am or what I'm doing with my life. It's become something of a game now in my mind, because he reveals his entire f*cking deck trying to lure me back, and all I have to do to get him to reveal this is... remain invisible!\n\nWhere am I at now?\n\nEvery single month is better than the last one. I'm learning a new language. I've really worked on my appearance via learning new makeup techniques and working out, and I'm getting asked out by new guys literally every week. (I'm a uni student, which should explain a lot. I've turned all of them down because I'm not ready to date just yet; I want to work on myself more.) My continued journey to understand and describe the horrors I went through has led to me becoming a deeper thinker and a much more articulate writer and speaker. I laugh so much these days that it sometimes causes pain in my face! (Antidepressants have been a huge help in resetting my brain chemistry after the abuse. Keep in mind that this sort of abuse alters your hippocampus and amygdala and causes your body to facilitate the release of a toxic chemical cocktail.) Pretty much every single relationship in my life has become deeper and more enriched. There's a deeper sense in the beauty of nature, babies, baby animals and music; I mean **damn** life is rich now!\n\nThere are actually some weird perks I've discovered that come from being preyed upon. Firstly, I have zero fear of public speaking now. It's really bizarre and I'm not  quite sure how that works, but I'll take it. Additionally, I can smell toxic people from a mile away. I can confidently say I have zero toxic people actively present in my everyday life. Also, for whatever reason I'm significantly more intelligent and efficient than I used to be.

I really am a badass!\n\nHang in there, friends. I promise it gets better. In time, and with therapy, possibly antidepressants and support, you ARE gonna make it through this. If you've just been discarded in the last several months, know this: all you have to focus on is the light at the end of the tunnel. All you have to do is MAKE it. And I know that sounds like a lot, which is why you have to take it one day (or even sometimes one second) at a time. Know that things will get better, especially when you don't feel like that's the case. You are all truly beautiful souls who are going through a refining fire, and the reason why it hurts is because you're like a new weapon being forged. You're going to come out better than how you went in. Trust the process. Get the help and support that you need and deserve right now. Trust that you will make it to the other end. Focus on taking care of yourself and respecting yourself.\n\nLoves, you've got this. It DOES get better. Your future self will thank you for hanging in there \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b\n\nEDIT: Thanks to whoever gave me the gold. \ud83d\udc9b", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I supported his growth in all aspects of life. \n\n*But he took me for granted, cheated on me, &amp; repeatedly lied to my face.* \n\nYes, I'm upset to not have who I thought was \"my person\" at my side anymore.

They had been together for years before deciding to date me pretty close to 3 years ago. Things were going great until it was found out that we all contracted herpes(80% likely my fault that we all contracted it. 100% my doctors fault for not testing me for it. I know that because I asked him to test me). Then the exgf was looking for any reason to make me look bad, and when it came time to her and I having time alone, she would either grumpily be with me, or she would call her exhusband and talk to him. She blew up at me publicly twice, once when we were at the park and I had asked her if I should go ask Sir if we could/should leave because she was complaining about a headache. I didnt know that he was talking about an important issue with a friend of his. She rudely told me to \"get it right\". Well, her friends had overheard her say that, and they confronted me about this, telling me that she shouldn't treat me that way. Well, I tried talking to her about it one night, nervous as can be because I have never really stood up to someone before, I've never really had to because I've always been a nice person and have never encountered someone who just seemed to hate me(and I'm sure she thought I was stupid, she stopped calling me smexy, a combination word of smart and sexy) and I thought of myself as his gf, and that he didnt deserve to have his gf treated that way, and confronted her about it. As you can imagine, I got verbally attacked. I decided to leave shortly after that. The whole lesbian relationship was new to me, as i have always had an attraction to females but never acted on it, and he was my first bf. I felt that I was making them more and more miserable, and she had been telling me that it's possible that he and I weren't a match(I kind of agree with her, if only because he never went to me about this stuff, only to her)\nI was terrible at communication, but was working on it. I believe he thought I needed to push to communicate when I needed to learn HOW to communicate. \n\nWell, one of the straws breaking the camels back was that we all have a fetlife account. I asked him if I could post a panty picture. Apparently I posted one that wasn't up to his standards. It was lace underwear. And I had gotten them from my mother, and they were minorly see through. I got into a whole bunch of flack for that picture, and we ended breaking up later in part because of it.  \n\nI had roamed the internet a few months later and found out that my exgf posted a picture that was even more revealing picture than my underwear one. I have since blocked her and haven't unblocked her since.\n\nAnother similar instance of this was when I asked permission to wear a corset at a Booby party. It was an under bust corset, so my boobs were hanging out. It was the first time I was smiling in months (I'm a bit of a nudist). The first thing my exgf does is rail me, publicly, in front of people, about how I didnt think of him and that she waited years before being allowed to do something like that. Then she asked if she was too harsh. Repetitively, and it wasn't a good time or place to bring it up. After her getting to play, she looked at me and said, \"no, something is wrong, because you look like your about to cry\" in the middle of the dungeon. And I was trying hard to hold back unsuccessfully, tears. My BF was upset with me, I could tell, because he slammed my car door shut (not hard enough to break it, but with enough force to tell he was upset) and that night I felt at a loss as to what to do to save either relationship. \n\nI've forgiven but not forgotten what has happened, and I'm sure I've crossed posted this many times, and she apologized to me for what I'm not even sure anymore, last year. I believe it was more for her bf than her being legit sorry. I do not trust her, so I have her blocked, still. On get and facebook(I had read on one of the groups we are both part of that she has gotten over her anger issues a year later. I wrote that off as hogwash and blocked her on that. \n\nShe had read that I was briefly homeless and offered to help me out if I ever needed it. I declined the offer, stating that I have friends helping me out. \n\nTldr: I have a history of mental/emotional abuse from my exgf, and have her still blocked on multiple social sites, not for emotional reasons, but because of her stupidity.

I made myself take self-defense classes to toughen up, I have developed good qualities, but I am still harmless and easily palatable to people. I hate being harmless because I associate it with grooming and abuse. I took all possible steps to distance myself from childhood grooming, but the personality step is difficult to do. \n\nI am a primary psychopath, but it does not help me because grooming was installed from very childhood. I can look like what psychopaths are stereotyped as to avoid grooming, but it will in the end make my life worse, because it doesn't have net gain. Even the charm associated with psychopaths, when shown by me, turns me into a free cuddly warm huggy snuggly therapist.\n\nThe only solution I see is rewriting my childhood, or removing surgically the brain and inserting a new, un-groomed one. Another way I cope is by learning new languages or speaking Hebrew, because i didn't socialize in these languages, so there is no grooming. But when I live in my country and speak my language, I act like a snuggly baby. I want to get rid of grooming in these languages too.

It very quickly turned nasty.\n\nHe made a comment (self pity filled) about why he is not trusted to go to bars, like normal men. I told him. Last time he did that, he started an affair with one main woman, but it turned out to be a LOT of women (from what I can gather, in his 6 months of doing this, he whored around at least 15 of her friends either with the symapthy or fucks, who knows) and spent thousands I had saved for my kids Christmas within 2 weeks partying and playing big shot. He immediately turns it on me. He refuses to address that behavior and blames me for perceived affairs he claims I had (also see my last post about coercive confessions). He starts attacking my \"behavior\" like a bulldog. I keep saying \"we were talking about you and your behavior, which you are not addressing\". He keeps going on the blame me tangent then comes up with some stupid \"philosophical\" point he demands I address. I keep clinging to the \" we weren't talking about me, we were addressing your actions\". Then he accuses me of trying to brainwash him (again to detract from addressing the point), and I keep saying, this isn't the point. We are addressing your behavior. Then he tells me my brainwashing doesn't work on him because he is too smart. And on it goes.\n\nHe never addresses the point and it spirals into him saying \"and this is why you are a narcissist. This is why you are abusing me. You don't see how clearly npd YOU are.\" The usual. \n\nHe talks about introspection (apparently o have none, but I constantly looking at my actions to see what my problems are). I tell him I am happy to be accountable for all I do wrong and admit to it, while he blames everyone else. I tell him an obvious lie he keeps throwing about his parents, which is easy to prove. He pulls out his phone and gets me to repeat it because he is going to show it to his mom who is, apparently \"on her last thread with my behavior\" (she is actually furious with him at the moment because he is irresponsible) and they have told him they are going to fight for my kids (good luck with their dog shit filled house and raising 3 jobless, immature narc children), and also pay me to get out of my kids lives. Lol not going to happen, EVER. He also tapes himself \"taking responsibility\" for something, which turns into an immediate blame everyone else and everything else for his failures.\n\nTo cut it short, he had a total injury rage meltdown on me. He kept drumming how abusive I am into me for hours until I was just exhausted.\n\nIntitally I felt like ahh, it is all him and his abuse yet again, but today cognitive dissonance set in and I am in so much internal conflict. What if he is right and I am the abusive narc who just doesn't see it because I am one. What if I am the root of the problem and am abusive to him?\n\nLet me just add that I had little input into the \"conversation\" because it was him talking at me and me trying to ignore it and dissociate (which might mean I am the problem because I can't mental process this right anymore). \n\nSo, am I experiencing cognitive dissonance or am I the issue?

He was telling me I'm perfect, he loves me, \"I'm yours\", etc. etc. Merely a few days after telling me I'm perfect, we got into a stupid fight that led him to instantly devalue and discard me. This hurt and was kind of shocking because it was such a small thing that made his feelings change from I'm \"perfect\" to he doesn't even want me in his life anymore. We spent two months apart not speaking. I guess since I didn't reach out to him at all (and I didn't have any needs for him to fulfill given that we were no longer in touch), he started to idealize me again and reached out to me and was saying all these things that made it seem like he wanted to be in a relationship with me. I agreed to meet again to talk about what happened/reconnect. We had a nice time together and what I thought was a productive conversation. But it seems he has already started to devalue me again! I'm guessing this time it's because maybe a.) the \"real\" me didn't live up to whatever his idealized version was when we were apart and/or b.) the bother of discussing any issues between us is unpleasant/inconvenient to him and/or c.) since he realized he could fairly easily \"get\" me again, I lost the imaginary value of someone 'unobtainable' who had lost interest in him.

It does hurt, though, because the girl he dated after me got idealized BIG TIME. She left him and I don't entirely understand the circumstances but it was related to difficulties in her life so maybe she closely fit his love-map to begin with, he can no longer have her, and it was for reasons that she can't be blamed for...so when I saw him this last time he was still majorly hung up on her and idealizing her, which kind of crushed me...I'm sad and jealous that she gets to be idealized by him so consistently and for so long...she never got devalued or discarded...and meanwhile I'm already devalued again just by virtue of letting him back into my life after splitting up over a very stupid argument....", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

For the last three years I would not allow my son to talk to his father on the phone because his conversation with my son was always negative and demeaning of me.

Despite the fact that I can legally do whatever I want, I still feel like I carry all this weight for both the decisions of the father and myself. Am I wrong for cutting him out? Is this going to hurt my son in the long run? Or will it hurt my son being around someone who speaks and treats women like garbage?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

This all started from a break up that happened between a girl whom I believed was \"the one\", and apparently they think it too. \n\nThis girl and I were together for quite some time. When she left for school, she abruptly told me she did not love me anymore and that she is seeing someone else. \n\nFrom that point on, all hell broke loose and a series of very confusing signals were given. I should have left, but did not. \n\nEventually, after months of strange behavior and abusive behavior, I cut contact entirely.\n\nThroughout this stage of no contact, I begin to recieve calls on a weekly basis from a blocked number. It appears in my phone logs. Knowing who it is, I struggle with the choice of reaching out and re-enstating my boundaries or simply ignoring it. \n\nAs her return from school approaches, I find the calls increase. \n\nOne night, I walk out to my truck and find a four page letter inside. \n\nThis throws me off, and makes me miss them...but I do not contact. \n\nThey show up at my office only 3 days after with an old phone of mine I had lost ages ago. They said they took it as a sign they should drop the phone off and try to contact me. \n\nI panic and somehow end up making the dumb decisions of spending time with them and hearing it out from their side. \n\nThey explain they could never love me fully and that their consistent calling was a coping mechanism to see if they were still blocked. They did not think I could see the logs. \n\nThey mention they have found someone new, but do not know if someone could love them like I did. They mention they dont want a relationship with me, but that they had an intent to get me back (????). \n\nThey say I am their soul mate and favorite person, but they could never hurt me like they did before so they will leave me alone. \n\nThey showed up, confused me and now I am craving to go see them again somehow, someway. I also feel a deep sense of violation and it scares me, because I feel sick and out of control of my privacy and own motives. I am a bit anxious, and am now thinking about them a lot.\n\nThey cried and cried claiming they want to see me again, and that it breaks their heart they are still blocked. I told them to block me to keep it even, and she said no because they care deeply for me. \n\nThis makes me feel as though it seems I domt care but I do, and i for some reason want them to know how much confusion and pain i have for them. \n\nI feel it should be noted that I am not currently interested in a relationship with them, but do feel all of this would go away if I can end things with a lift of my block and a truce on friendship.\n\nI feel so guilty for some reason and do not know why. \n\nI dont understand what they want and I'm pissed off and confused.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

But the state always goes away eventually, and I feel like I'm losing something. If I can't pity myself anymore, what does that make my experience? Part of it is that I feel ugly in a sense. If I'm numb to the idea that a man was sexually attracted to me, I feel like I'm losing my sexuality.

What do you think?", "author": "throwaway200551", "self_text": "Okay, so a month ago I was discarded by my Nex. I had previously broken up with him but he kept hoovering and when I accepted him back, he dumped me. Have been no contact since then.\n\nAfter 30 days no contact I can't say that I'm completely healed from everything I went through with Nex.\n\nAnyway, there is this \"new\" guy: some time ago, before even meeting my narc for the first time, I met this guy from grad school. We're never really close, but he asked me on a date. At the time we both studied and worked, so our schedule was very restrict which led us to a series of mismatches. Until one day he asked me out, I was out of town and only answered a few days later, when he texted apologizing and saying he was recently back with his ex. I wished them good luck and didn't talk to him again. A month later I started dating my abusive ex. Something like 8 months goes by and the grad school guy reaches out and texts me asking about how is life. We have a brief exchange in which I tell him I am in a relationship he says his relationship with his ex didn't last long after our last exchange, and that he wanted to ask me out for a time but was waiting until he recovered from the break up. He wished me luck and that was it.\n\nFlash-forward to last week, when I randomly meet him, we catch up and exchange phone numbers. We text a lot, meet for a coffee, he gives me a book written by my favorite author and keep texting during the week. We went on 2 dates and on the last one we kissed.\n\nThe thing is, I don't know if I'm traumatized with the whole thing with my nex, but I'm feeling like there are some red flags. i don't know if I'm right or if I'm just emotionally unavailable. I'll listen the things that are making me uneasy:\n\n* He texts me the whole day incessantly. (This really scares me since my Nex did the same in the beginning of our relationship, he texted me nonstop even while I was at work or classes. By the end of our relationship, he would ignore my texts for hours, even when he was not busy and if I dared to ask about his change of behavior he would say I was being silly and vain for caring for texts. Never mind we were in a LDR relationship when he decided our texting was too much for him. Now I see that it was all bs since he was the one to establish the communication pattern). With this new guy I tried to establish some boundaries about communication, and he seems to understand it, but he is still texting me a lot.\n* He compliments me a lot to a point that made me uncomfortable and I had to tell him this and he hasn't stopped. It's so exaggerated that it feels fake (this one is a specially important red flag to me because that's what my nex lovebombed me in the beginning). He is aware I'm out of a really confusing relationship and i've told him that constant and out of nowhere compliments trigger me, but still, he continues...\n* He wants us to meet everyday and is always finding excuses for us to see each other. (My nex did the same in the beginning and it mad me get involved pretty fast).\n* On the other day he asked me out for a coffee, I said I would see if I could but that I'd probably stop by our college at some time and if he was available when I did, we could grab a coffee together, he proceeded to send me a long text stating exactly where he would be during the afternoon, including times and places, and said I should text him whenever I was there and he would stop what he was doing to meet me. I need to add that one of the activities he listed was a class in which he was the teacher, so I can't come to terms with the fact that he would simply leave class and students holding for a simple coffee.\n* Sometimes when I text him on whatsapp minutes after his last text, my messages will immediately show the \"seen\" sign, which means he had our conversation open. I don't really think this is strange per si, but it's happening frequently. Also, his \"last seen\" was not shown previously, but today, he put it to show which made me think maybe he did it to see my \"last seen\".\n* After 2 dates he keeps sending me these romantic texts stating he is thinking of me, that he misses me, wants to hug me, wants to kiss me and I just think it's too soon for this.\n* He knows I'm recently out of a relationship and am not ready for anything serious and want to take things really slow (I've told him exactly this) but keeps asking me out everyday (I'm not exaggerating, he has asked me out everyday since the day we randomly met)\n* I got sick this weekend and when I told him this he said he would love to take care of me. I said thanks but declined, but he kept going back to this subject and pushing it, saying  that i should let him take care of me.\n* He sent me a song that described a man who is so in love he'll make anything for a woman. I said it was a cute song then he said that he meant it for me, that the lyrics described what he felt, that he would do anything i wanted, I just needed to ask. I replied with an emoji and he said he was afraid of being too intense. I sent him a long text explaining (again) that I was fresh out of a crazy-making relationship and was not ready to enter a new one, that I understood he seemed to want one, but I was not ready for it, so I would understand if he wanted to pursue more available people. He said he just wants to see me and can wait. I said I don't need him to wait for me and maybe am not even ready to date again, only if it's casual and even then I don't know, he said he understood and wanted to try nevertheless.\n* On the other day I mentioned to him that I went to college with his friend's wife. He later tells me he was talking to his friend and him and his wife are asking us to visit them on Sunday so that the four of us could have wine and make dinner. I declined it, because I think it's such a couple's activity and it would make me uncomfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDo you think those are red flags or am I overreacting?\n\nI just think it's too much too soon, but am afraid I'm just being triggered by my old experiences. Also, some of the things he do are what I wanted to get from my ex, but never got, but I wanted to get it from him when WE WERE in a relationship, I just think this guy is kinda forcing a serious relationship that does not exist at this point.\n\nBy this point I'm thinking it was a mistake to go back to the dating scene. I was not even planning to do it so soon, but decided to go for it since it was a guy that I had previously met, even if not that well, and for whom I had wondered \"what if\"s since he was he guy I could have dated before my ex and if it had worked maybe I would have escaped that whole terrible relationship.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The last narc I encountered had some covert narc traits. He was very selfish, self absorbed and insecure about his appearance. Always blamed life for his problems. I guess we sort of connected over our hardships but he was obsessed with being abandoned by me. He used to constantly ask me if he was a bad friend would I leave him or stay. I thought it was a bit odd. We weren\u2019t even in a relationship. Also I think he was seeing someone but kept saying it was an old friend. I knew he was lying. So just a few days ago he messaged me and I took a while to get back to him so he just goes bye and then I replied but he just ignored me.

My mother has a boyfriend and they have regular sex, loudly. If I were a regular person I would just say \u201cew\u201d put in some headphones and call it a day, but hearing her is extremely triggering for me. As a kid she and my father had extremely loud sex nearly every day, sometimes more than once a day. Most parents would try to be quiet so the kids don\u2019t hear because they understand that it\u2019s inappropriate to expose them to that stuff, even if it\u2019s just audio. I mean, you wouldn\u2019t show a kid porn with no audio, so why is the other way around ok? Either way it\u2019s wrong. But my parents didn\u2019t care about that.\n\nAs a child I knew it felt dirty to hear them, especially considering they\u2019re my parents, but I would listen to them a lot and this is something I\u2019m ashamed of. Plus I didn\u2019t have an iPod or anything else to block the noise. My sister had the joy of being a deep sleeper but I suffered with insomnia and light seeping so if I wasn\u2019t already awake listening to them, I was woken up by it. My mother gave me the talk around five or six, so I knew what they were doing. I know I only listened because I was curious but looking back it really fucked me up.\n\nFast forward through the years and this goes on even into my teens and my sister and I have had our turns coming home to her fucking her boyfriend obnoxiously.

It\u2019s frustrating and made me feel disgusting and full of shame. Nobody should have their personal space invaded like this. It feels like such a violation, and just makes me feel like I don\u2019t matter.\n\nI really need a second opinion so please tell me if you think this kind of behavior is abusive.

Making friends has been impossible without social media, and when a kid I meet searches my name online, the results are sick. I'm too scared to even talk to other people because of this. \n\nI think about it all day, it controls my life. Just knowing that this stuff is out there makes it hard to get through a day. It has been 3 years since this. I reported it to police the same week it happened. Police did nothing. My family has tried everything they could in terms of legal and mental health help but nothing has changed. This stuff still exists out there and it's my only identity now... theres nothing to change that. I'm so hopeless and suicidal.\n\nThe first two years I was too scared to leave my house. This past year I did leave my house but any time I do I just break down crying. I cant see a reflection of myself in the mirror without thinking about how I'm just some girl in child porn to thousands of sick men.\n\nIt's genuinely been 3 years of trying everything we could. I know I just have to accept it's out there, that my name is tarnished, and move on, but how? Can anyone recommend books that might help? Maybe on acceptance or... I dont even know.

For context, we've been dating 4 years, living together 2 years.  I believe my \"live and let live\" nature has contributed to allowing this to happen to me without me even realizing it.\n\nI have begun to count the criticisms I receive on a daily basis.  It's staggering. \nI decided to do this because lately my self confidence, which I really struggled to build in the first place, has been incredibly low.  I won't list everything (would take forever), but no matter what I do, it ALWAYS would have been \"easier/smarter\" to do it another way.  On top of that, we both work similar hours, yet I do probably 85% of the housework and get to receive criticism for THAT as well.  Here are a few of the more common things I hear on a daily basis:\n\n\"You stink/smell bad\" (I shower sometimes twice daily now)\n\n\"Our house is disgusting, you need to clean it better\"\n\n\"THAT is what you're going to wear!?\"\n\n\"Why the hell do you put the baking sheet there (under the oven), it makes no fucking sense\"\n\nUp until now, I'd normally just agree and attempt to fix whatever is making her unhappy.  If I try to explain myself, I get a long drawn-out sigh, an eyeroll, and possibly a \"Jesus Christ\" muttered under her breath as a response.\n\nThe list goes on, if you're reading this there's a good chance you can picture what the rest of the list might look like.\n\nAnyways, one night, as I was getting to the end of my shift at work (late at night), she texts me:\n\nHer: I'm hungry\n\nMe: want me to grab something on my way home?\n\nHer: yes but whatever you want\n\nMe: Like snacks, or actual food? (Options are limited near where I work, theres a convenience store thats open and one bar that might still be serving food at this time)\n\nHer: Whatever you want\n\nBeing that I was basically done work when she texted (she knew this), and I was dead tired and not wanting to wait for the bar, I bought a few of her favorite snacks from the store.  On my drive home, all I could think was: \"I hope this is what she wanted, I hope this is good enough\".\n\nI get home, and she's dressed in lingerie, waiting for me.\n\nHer: That's not food\n\nMe: You said to get whatever I wanted, and you implied that snacks are fine (I made a point to use a neutral tone of voice, as I had guessed this might be her response no matter what I brought home)\n\nHer: Wow, no need to be a douche bag about it\n\nMe: (mustering up all my courage - normally I'd just apologize) I'm not being a douche bag.  You texted me that you were hungry, you said you didn't care if it was snacks or a meal from the bar.  If you had a preference, you should have said something instead of telling me to get \"whatever I want\".\n\nHer: Yup. Now you're just being a fucking douche bag.\n\nShe then storms off, making a big spectacle about changing out of her lingerie and into her normal pajamas.  Cue silent treatment for a couple of hours.  \n\nOnce she has decided to talk to me again:\n\nHer: Hey I know I was acting a bit crazy, but you're the only one who understands me and puts up with my craziness, so I need you to be there for me next time instead of being an asshole.\n\nMe: (regrettably) Sorry\n\nHer:  Thank you\n\nWe haven't had sex since, it has been weeks.  I guess this is a \"discard\"?  Still new here, so not sure.  She definitely started love-bombing me yesterday though.\n\nDoes anyone else have a similar story, or is anyone able to offer me some guidance here?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We get together as often as we can and try and help each other out in dealing with the narcissistic abuse we\u2019ve both been through. \n\nShe has suffered a great deal and is currently trying to get her life on track as her N had her entangled in a world of alcoholism, drugs and it got to a point where she was really depressed. It even got to a point where he would no longer let her speak to me or other friends and family who didn\u2019t agree with \u201chis ways.\u201d Regardless, she got out of it when she hit bottom and went away to recovery and is doing well.

Funny enough, to take things \"slow\" he doesn't want ANYONE to know about things while he's here with me almost every day. He refuses to add me back on social media accounts. \nNext problem is he has the biggest fear of giving me any kind of compliment, making me feel good or saying I love you. And he even gets frustrated and mad when I try to mention it. In fact any problem whatsoever is something I better not bring up or he blows up without an actual explanation on the matter. As if I made a mistake to even bring it up which will lead to me begging him to be calm and to \"shake hands\" and leave it all together. The problem will never be addressed and if I dare to bring it up at a later point he will discard it as something from the past. \n\nLast problem is that I'm now out of hospital and basically disabled for the next few days at least. Suddenly he is nowhere to be seen, leaving me to figure things out on my own. \n\nAs I'm typing this all I'm sure the red flags are very very clear but I love this guy so dearly and things are going on for so long. I would love to have people with experience on this matter to slap me in the face and point it out for me.

Let\u2019s call him Tim. I cut Tim off a few days before my 17th birthday in December of 2017. I feel like I\u2019ll never get over it and it\u2019s ruining my life. I feel like it\u2019s my fault, because I let it go on for so long and I hid it from everybody and lied to everyone including my other friends. I am kind of clingy and he gave me attention 24/7 and because of that I loved him more than anything and I did everything for him and protected him at all costs. He used to beat me up a few times a day, once if I was lucky. He never hospitalized me or anything but there'd always be bruises and marks and it wasn't great. Whenever I cried he would just hold me and tell me he loved me more than anything and afterwards we just didn\u2019t talk about it. Idk things just sucked, Tim would steal my things and break my things and punch holes in my wall/ceiling and he forced me to get into a relationship with a really toxic guy. Well anyways he was always a little possessive and jealous and that summer I broke up with that guy and it got so much worse, Tim would throw my stuffed animals at the wall if  was cuddling them instead of him and he was jealous of my one blanket just cause it had a guy on it and he told me I wasn't allowed to get a boyfriend and just idk it was weird. Well then he would like force himself on me. At first it was just him kissing me, which I told him i wasn't comfortable with because I was not attracted to him, but idk he's just say stuff like \"Oh don't pretend you don't like it\". At this point my close friends knew he was hitting me and stuff and he didn't really try to hide it, one time my other friend, let\u2019s call her Mal, was over and he hit me in front of her so she hit him and he hit her harder and like idk it was a mess. Well after I moved into a different house he kept saying that we needed to have sex and I was like um no but he told me that I didn't have a choice and that he'd just rape me and I was like hey that's not funny and he'd say \"Well I'm not joking\" but it was one of those things that I didn't want to take seriously because I thought i could not survive without him in my life. So I agreed to have sex like 2 or 3 times and then I was like yeah okay no more but at that point I he felt entitled to it I guess, like I'd say no and he's just say I wouldn't have a choice, it got to the point where I'd hold my pants and underwear on as hard as I could but he was stronger so. And idk I just hid it from everyone because I thought he was all that I had, he knew everything about me and he was really sweet sometimes, but it was really hard because he would just physically/verbally/sexually abuse me and I didn't know what to do. Well anyways my friend Mal moved in and Mal was very protective of me so I finally accepted that I would have to let him go and I told him I didn't him to come over anymore and then a few days later we got in a huge argument and he like told me that he never loved me and just idk it was fucked. So I've tried to get over all of this many times but it was just hard. I have problems with paranoia now, like I can\u2019t sleep in bed alone and I can\u2019t sleep without my back to a wall and the thought or giving another person oral makes me want to vomit.

When I am feeling down about myself, my achievements, where I am in life, and I stare in the mirror I am instantly an eighteen-year-old girl, locked in your bathroom hoping to God or whoever may answer, that it isn\u2019t the night my life ends. I think about how first responders may describe the scene to my parents. How the news and media will make the entire situation seem like a tragic event, \u201cShe was an excellent student, she was involved in student activities, she was beautiful, bright, full of life and hope\u2014a tragedy, really\u201d they\u2019ll say.\r\n\r\nIf I close my eyes for long enough I can remember the way that moment consumed me. I can see the way my hair was matted to my bleeding lip, the sounds of you screaming and beating on the door, and the smell of recently sprayed air freshener. \n\nI can hear you swearing on everything that I will never leave that bathroom alive and how instead of focusing on your threats, my mind narrowed in on the lime stain around the drain in the sink and I wondered how long it had been there and how many other people had noticed it. \n\nI drowned out the noise escaping your body for what seemed like hours, distracting myself with dirty tile grout and the dust collecting in corners of the bathroom when for whatever reason I decided to jump. \n\nI jumped out of a two-story bathroom window, knowing that anything that happened to me out there\u2014in the real world, was much better than anything confined to that sad excuse of a home. Without any of my things, abandoning my phone, my wallet, and my purse, I ran to the university campus, pleading for anyone, someone to notice.\n\nNo one did.  \r\n\r\nYou tainted the way I see the world and the possibility of seeing the good in people. \r\n\r\nWithout asking, you took away precious moments of my life and lit them on fire before my eyes. \r\n\r\nStanding in court, pleading my case, and hearing you declare that you will find me, you will kill me, and you will rid the world of another whore, rings in my mind every now and then. \n\nEspecially during the darkest moments of my life, the furthest I have ever felt down, I somehow remember your face and the truly ugly moments of preparing myself to see you in person and relive the most disturbing splices of my life for an entire court of strangers to witness. \r\n\r\nLooking back now, four years later, I realize that I have grown. I have learned to live with what happened to me, to manipulate and mold my life into what I want and who I want to be. I am happy, or as happy as I can possibly convince myself to be. \r\n\r\nGranted, you have stolen both minuscule and immense moments in my life. Graduating college on time, going out at night without double-guessing my safety, trusting another human being, or knowing what a stable and healthy friendship may look like. You have robbed me of a risk-free and care-free early adulthood. And for that, nothing in my being will ever forgive you. I may forget with time, but I will never forgive. \r\n\r\nIn saying everything, I have never looked for pity or sympathy from anyone, not even myself. The reality is that so many men and women of all ages have and will go through what I have, if not worse. Some will come forward, many will not. One day I hope that I can live without the constant thought of your potential in the back of my mind and that I will outgrow the thought of you possessing the ability to destroy my will to live a normal life. \r\n\r\nI am grateful to say that with time, unconditional support and the will to govern my own life, I have found happiness and have come to terms with most everything. \r\n\r\nI will never again let anyone steal parts of me that are essential to my well-being and happiness and for that,  I thank you.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

There was another girl in the car I thought he was going to get with so I went off with my own little world and then to the party - more tequila, more gin and such. \n\nI still believe I wouldn\u2019t of done anything sober, to my core I don\u2019t quite understand how I\u2019ve got here. It\u2019s triggered some past trauma I didn\u2019t realise I had until now. I\u2019m not quite ready to express what happened because in my own head it\u2019s fucked too, I believed I was safe and perhaps it was just harmless fun but no. I didn\u2019t want to go all the way so why did I, why did I ever think I was okay and made myself believe perhaps it was for awhile. I think I won\u2019t get a part of me back and I am terrified. I filed a case against him, but I am scared to go court yet since I can\u2019t quite find the words or make sense of why it happened! I didn\u2019t realise how much this all truly effected me until I got horrendously drunk with my friends and it poured out of me and that\u2019s when I realised something is wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s a weird battle within myself. I\u2019m going to be getting professional help to properly get to roots of these emotions and thoughts. I really don\u2019t want to be alone in this, please just someone talk to me.

A study at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, determined that children who see their parents verbally abusing each other are more likely to be depressed or anxious, and to experience more interpersonal problems of their own. Interestingly, the study also found that verbal aggression between parents was more traumatic to children than physical violence between parents.'\n\nWhile that matched up very accurately with my experiences, my brain really never registered this as a threat- instead it registered her constant screaming as a 'I'm going to die' kind of response and really built up strong anxiety fundamentals in my childhood.\n\nThe screaming was sometimes at me, sometimes at my dad, sometimes at my grandmother, often the target would switch because it was probably more a representation of her extreme emotions (anger, hatred, depression, panic, misery, unfairness, probably more stuff mixed in).\n\nAnyway my brain linked the anxiety flares to the constant weekly 4 hour long screaming sessions rather than her hatred of my father (although in adulthood I've noticed that that does factor into anxiety as well).\n\nFailing to find any articles on the emotional/mental effects on children that constant exposure to screaming has, I'm hoping someone knows about some peer-reviewed articles or studies I can read up on to figure out the causality and other issues I have developed but am not yet aware of.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I told said mans wife what was going on and my ex actaully had me convinced I was the problem for doing that.\n\nI caught her cheating 1 time before. I was 500 miles away finishing school. We shared a rental home where she was living and I rented a basement where I was going to school. Commuted back and forth at least once a month but usually more. I had 2 ipads and I gave her 1 to use. She logged into her FB messenger and it synced onto my ipad. I saw her convos with a guy she was seeing. I drove home unannounced to call her out. She convinced me I was a fault for snooping. Im pretty sure I apologized to her. What the heck was I thinking!?\n\n8 months later I have moved back and living with her. She worked 8-4 and went to school 6-10 mon-thurs. During this time I would get up with her kid, feed him, take him to day care, pick him up, make dinner, bathe him, put him to bed. All while shes a \"school\". I saw her grades in intermediate algebra and it was a 36%. I accused her of not going to classes and she blew up on me. Belittled me and told me how terrible I was. All the while she was grabbing drinks with all of these new girlfriends id never heard of, let alone met. She had very few friends.\n\nMothers day this year her 4 yr old son told me they went and had ice cream with mommies friend and mommy told him not to tell me. She told me it was nbd and it was her friends bf that they happned to bump into. She gave me a name. I snooped her computer and wouldn't you know it I found this guy. It was a man shes been talking to for some time and hes married.\n\nI ask her about him and she goes right into how Im not romantic anymore. We never go out. I don't show her that I love her anymore. I used to do little things just to surprise her. Saying anything to put the blame on me. Maybe the original excitement of a new thing was worn off damn we were a faimly. Raising her child whos father abandoned them both while she was pregnant I thought was the ultimate romantic thing to do.\n\nAfter that I told this guy shes been seeings wife and it started another sh*tstorm. Im a terrible person she could never trust again and told me I can never see her son again. That what she did was wrong but I was intentionally trying to hurt her. I also told her sister what the truth was so she couldn't make up some story about how I was the reason the relationship failed to her family. That really upset her that everyone knew the truth and she couldn't spin it in her favor. \n\nIts been almost a month now. Ive moved out and 3 days later married man moved in after his wife kicked him out. She told me it's not her fault she has feelings for married man and \"hes a really great guy\".  She knew how to break my heart by withholding her son from me. The kid ive rasied as my own since he was 6 months old. Hes almost 5 now. The last time I saw him was when I was moving my stuff out of the house. I was giving him a hug and she ripped him from my arms and left.

of NPD, but not all... it's got me extremely confused when trying to relate to him.\u00a0 Almost feels like I'M more of a N than he is.\u00a0 I'll start from the beginning, and hopefully get to the bottom of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am an outspoken, confident, sarcastic, Empathetic person.\u00a0 I met my now-ex back at the end of December of 2016.\u00a0 He and I fell in love almost immediately, and spent part of every day together.\u00a0 He would always come visit me after he was done for work, staying until the late hours, and then returning home.\u00a0 When I would inquire about visiting his place instead, he would always make excuses about it being too messy, etc.\u00a0 It became our personal joke, and after months of inquiring and getting no traction, I finally let it drop.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter 5 months of dating, I expressed to him my desire to leave my full time job and go back to school to be an auto mechanic.\u00a0 He supported my decision, offering assistance in whatever I needed, and financially supported me while out of work, even paying for my school.\u00a0 School was... bad.\u00a0 There was a huge learning curve, and I was not prepared for being a part of it.\u00a0 As he was wont to remind me, he had spent thousands of dollars for me to crash and burn.\u00a0 For us, this was basically the beginning of our major conflict and the end of our relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to December.\u00a0 I had been out of work since the previous May, fully living on his dime, while he paid for my apartment/car payments and insurance/food/everything.\u00a0 He starts interviewing for positions outside the state, accepting a position in Boston (a few hours away), and we agree to move there together.\u00a0 From December through March, I stayed with him at Air Bnbs for a few weeks, then a week or two back at my apartment, and on.\u00a0 I looked for apartments and found quite a few that would work, but each time I found one that we really liked, the application process would always be delayed by something or other.\u00a0 Sick of this, and after he encouraged me to do so, I started looking at real estate listings, and even arranged to see a few of them with a Realtor.\u00a0 This, too, came to nothing, and he claimed it was too expensive to consider.\u00a0 During this time we fought about money constantly.\u00a0 He couldn't figure out why I was dead-set against getting a job until we had a permanent place to live (so I could provide a real, local address of course), and I couldn't figure out why he was throwing up road blocks left and right preventing me from accomplishing this.\u00a0 I would land back at my apartment like it was some kind of punishment.\u00a0 He became more and more distressed by his financial situation, paying for his old apartment, my apartment, and an Air Bnb, while also trying to arrange for a 4th apartment in Boston.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, at the end of March of last year, I pinned him down and we agreed to get a place starting at the beginning of April in one of the suburbs.\u00a0 He put down a deposit, I changed my address on my resume, and diligently applied for jobs both in Boston and locally where I am (at his urging).\u00a0 I accepted part time position near Boston that would allow me to work while also continuing to interview for full time positions.\u00a0 When I let him know, he flipped out on me, started a huge fight, and made me accept a full time position back where I lived at home.\u00a0 (as a side note, I still work here now, and they have been a wonderful family through this stress)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQueue increasing difficulties in our relationship, dealing with a long distance relationship that had been forced upon me, and his waxing and waning interest in seeing me regularly.\u00a0 He didn't show up for the big holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, his birthday... and I just quietly seethed at home, continuing to accept his financial assistance and making excuses for him with my co-workers.\n\nWe broke up and got back together so many times beginning May last year, I can't even tell you how many there were.\u00a0 It became a very similar pattern: I would yell at him about how fed up I was by our situation, he would make promises and reconcile with me, then time would pass and he would flake on the promises.\u00a0 At one point he had me picking out engagement rings, doing the research, even met with a local jeweler who had everything ready to go if he would just pay for the thing.\u00a0 And he flaked again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI began seeing less and less of him.\u00a0 He gave up his local address and didn't have a specific reason to be near me except to come visit me.\u00a0 From September through this past May, our conflicts overwhelmed our good times.\u00a0 He still would promise things, and then renege or flake, and I was always furious with him, but we'd always drift back together again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've always struggled with depression, and it seemed to get worse and worse from each rejection from him.\u00a0 Finally, at the end of April, while we had been on the outs for several weeks, I threatened suicide.\u00a0 Although I did not go through with it, I know that he was very upset and it was very difficult for him to figure out what to do about it.\u00a0 He finally arranged to come see me the following weekend and we chatted and relaxed but I refused to have sex with him.\u00a0 This is the last time I actually saw the man.\u00a0 Once again, during this meeting, he had agreed to work on finding a place for us to live in Boston, and in the following weeks I was extremely disappointed to see his lack of effort, called him out on it, and eventually we broke things off for good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA week later, after trying to figure out if this really was going to be the last time we broke up, a woman contacted me here on Reddit, using my first name.\u00a0 She didn't message me back right away, so I took the time to scour her post and comment history, all over adultery subredits, and learned a bunch about her, including that she had been dating MY boyfriend since September of last year.\u00a0 Also find out that he has a secret wife and children (7 &amp; 11), still married to her, and who doesn't know anything about the two of us.\u00a0 This is the woman he had claimed to have been in an 11 year relationship with, but that he had never married, no kids, and it ended after she took a job in another city.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, this woman, who also shares my first name, finally responds back to me and starts unraveling this tale, something you only hear about on daytime talk shows, talking about how he met her on Tinder, told her the same lines he told me about never married/no children, except for one difference.\u00a0 She happened to see his gym membership card, with a different last name than he had originally claimed, and investigated it until she found her own info.\u00a0 Unfortunately for me, this happened in December of last year, and she sat on this info until she was quite done with him, only telling me months later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I decide that I'm going to inform his wife the following day, as I cannot just let this go.\u00a0 I draft a beautiful letter, detailing the outlines of our relationship, giving her examples of how I had influenced her life (like the fact that she currently lives with him in the condo I had selected for the two of us), choosing and buying his clothes for him, making him hand-made sweaters, cutting his hair and toe nails, introducing him to the finer points of weed smoking (he had no prior experience), reddit, and so many other things... he was like a chameleon, soaking up my tendencies and culture, and incorporating them into his own life.\u00a0 His other girlfriend mentioned several things he had introduced her to that came directly from me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat followed was a shit show of epic proportions.\u00a0 I had originally planned a fabulous way to pay him back for how he had lied to me about literally everything that mattered in his life, but my plan was thwarted early on (for the best, as most of my friends and loved ones have told me).\u00a0 His wife asked me various questions, and I forwarded her key conversations where I was able to prove his past involvement with other women (I thought nothing of it at the time, of course, but he had been married for the entire time, so...), all of our plans for engagement rings, and every time he mentioned her in our text history.\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also began insulting my ex at every turn, email, texts, our other ways of communicating with each other.\u00a0 I was determined to get him to admit to me directly all of his indiscretions, would call him out on his lies, and heckle him some more.\u00a0 He didn't hurl back insults, just took it.\u00a0 That was always his classic move, to say something like \"I'm sorry I keep hurting you, if you want to leave me and find someone better I completely understand,\" while we were dating.\u00a0 Now it was \"I'm so sorry I hurt you, I understand if you don't want anything further to do with me.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI squeezed him out for all he's worth, all the information he had to offer.\u00a0 I'm still not satisfied with his answers, and I doubt anyone but he knows the full extent of his betrayals of the women in his life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, back to why I'm writing all of this.\u00a0 Obviously I understand that the lying and manipulation are classic Narcissist behaviors, but every time he speaks to me, he's not trying for self preservation, it really feels like he loves me and is just hurting, like a normal person.\u00a0 A normal person who decided to string along not one, not two, but three separate women and also having unprotected sex with all of them, yes, but after everything I've read it really doesn't feel like he's a true Narc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny

After that age, I had virtually zero contact with my mom (abandonment and drug abuse, my father had full custody) and that side of the family - i had mental health issues all my life but had flashbacks around the ages of 18-20 and then flashbacks of the rape shortly after.\n\nMy sister also experienced abuse, she keeps in touch with our mother and has informed her (she did not know it occurred) so (i\u2019m hoping) that is enough to keep other children out of danger.

We've been great at the start - he was unemployed back then when we first started dating 4 years ago. After a long serious talk with him I managed to convince him to get a job so that we could both work for a future together. At first it seemed really great and everything was working out fine but as time went by he started changing and would often lash out at me if I asked him to spend some time with me. We would also more than often fight about some pretty small stuff, but it all always centers around his work - He comes home, tells me he has so much work to finish and his boss is telling him he's not performing, and he tells me I'm the cause of it. We've talked this through and I've agreed to be more supportive in the sense that I will live in this relationship by throwing away any expectations of him spending some time with me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt got harder as time passed by as he would only spend 1 hour with me on good days and on bad days where he says he was busy, we don't get to spend time at all. I value time spent in the relationship because in an LDR that's all we would get and I want to make full use of it. However we broke off about a month ago as he told me I was a huge waste of his time and he would be better off without me (in terms of career advancement, and what he wants in life). I couldn't stand the way he threw those hurtful words with me and I resolved to leave him as I believed that relationships should be able to help grow the both of us, not put us down. I also constantly hated the fact that I had to ask him for things as basic as \"could you spend some time with me today?\" I also couldn't stand being hurt multiple times when he kept saying I deserved everything he has done due to how I've pressurized him to get a job in the past.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow a few days later we got back together and he told me he would change his perception of me. He promised that he would make things better as long as I could give him time off and in return, I talked to him about how hurtful his words were to me and I hoped he would never bring me down like that again (It really hurts to be told you are an obstacle in his life when you are trying so hard to do everything you can for the relationship). I was really happy and thought that everything would go smoothly but I was wrong. Fast forward to yesterday: \n\n* He told me how negative his work performance was again and it was all because of him having to spend time with me. I told him he had to know how to prioritize his time and explained that maybe there are other factors causing him to underperform at work. I also told him to learn how to manage his expectations at work.\n* He got mad and started saying the same things I feared: He wanted to prioritize his family, career and friendships. He said he has nothing because of me. And because of me he can't get anywhere. The worst part was I wasn't included in his list of priorities so I got flustered and sought clarification from him.\n* He denies saying that and says I'm assuming things (But he did say those things and typed it out word for word I just don't know why he's not being responsible for his words). He also says I'm the one who is causing him to not advance in his life and when I wanted an answer from him he told me he's not letting go.\n* Of course by the time I hear all of this I'm confused as heck and I was outraged because the things that he told me were exactly the things I told him would hurt me! I wanted him to explain what he meant by that and I was insistent in getting an answer but he keeps denying his part for ever saying that and says I'm assuming things, and if it was indeed true then I deserved it because I started this whole thing by constantly stressing him him out about having to spend time with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told him I had his answer since he never gave me an explanation on what he meant by that and just said I am causing him to lose his footing in everything he does. In reality I'm a confused sheep and I feel *absolutely terrible.* I feel like I've been *destroyed.* Yet I can't wash away this sense of guilt that's consuming me: Am I really a toxic person for expecting him to spend sometime or put in some effort into this relationship? I don't know what I am. I tried to change, I really did, yet his perception of me is still the same. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat should I do to change the tide or should I even bother anymore? How do I change to be a better person for him? At this point it seems like no matter what I do he's not even going to listen. I feel like I'm getting stringed along for a ride. I don't know what I am to him, I want to clarify that but he's not giving me an answer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease help ;=;", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

For plenty of reasons. But the main reason people think I don\u2019t want to see it ever is because \u201cthey broke my heart so bad that I just can\u2019t get over it\u201d or something. That\u2019s not really the case... Yes they hurt me years ago, but there\u2019s so much more to the story than that.\n\nSo my friend who\u2019s throwing the up-coming get-together: she\u2019s one of the few people who talked to me about \u201cit,\u201d since she asked. I didn\u2019t tell the whole story, I just explained how he would lie to my face in order to get sex while doing things behind my back (we weren\u2019t official and he was my ex at this point, but he knew if I found out there were other girls I would leave).\n\nHer response was something along the lines of: \u201cMen can\u2019t help it because they\u2019re biologically wired to get as many girls as they can\u201d\n\nExcusing toxic masculinity pretty much... I get that science dictates that men are hornier than women on average, but I don\u2019t think that justifies lying and manipulation? I was kinda shocked by her response. \n\nThis friend group in particular seems to either deny or excuse everything he does, concluding that \u201cthis is simply how men in today\u2019s society behave\u201d which is really not chill with me. Aside from me, he\u2019s caused an insane amount of drama for everyone closely involved with him. Someone has accused him of trying to rape, although of course he and that group deny it and say she\u2019s lying. \nI took the time and money to do a background check on him because the curiosity was killing me. turns out that he has been arrested for 2 little DUIs and oh yeah, SEXUAL ASSAULT.\n\nI\u2019m already entirely done with this group. I have other friends. The question is: should I tell them why I\u2019m never going to show up, or just keep silently ignoring this? \nI don\u2019t think the narc and I\u2019s \u201cmutual friends\u201d are aware that I\u2019m not actually friends with them anymore. It hurts that I\u2019ve known many of them since middle school, but it\u2019s getting to the point where I dislike them almost as much as the narc itself... If they managed to stay friends with him this long, odds are they know very well of his abusive tendencies and yet they simply don\u2019t mind. Fuck that.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

(I\u2019m bad with time.) It lasted around four months, from beginning to end, and... After that point, I cut off all contact with the abuser. We, at that point, had two mutual friends. I told them it was me or the abuser - I wasn\u2019t content to have any ties to them. One of them sided with the abuser, because they \u201cdidn\u2019t want to pick sides\u201d and chose to lie to me instead. The other... Had a long back and forth, which has eventually ended in an uncomfortable \u201cwe don\u2019t talk but are friends even though he refriended my abuser\u201d situation.\n\nSo, now... I\u2019ve been checking my abuser\u2019s mutuals fairly regularly, and the other day when I did, one of my closer friends was among them. I told her, pretty quickly, essentially framing it as \u201chey, you\u2019re friends with my abuser, if I tell you who it is will you unfriend them\u201d and she wanted to know who it was before answering - which concerned me, but I told her anyway, and she basically said she isn\u2019t ready to commit to that kind of decision, and that she needs to not be cutting people out of her life right now.\n\nI can sympathize with her reasoning, and I know she\u2019s in a not very good, vulnerable place right now, but I also feel really hurt and betrayed. One of the things she said in specific was \u201cif this were any other time, I\u2019d do it\u201d or something roughly along those lines, but I... Fundamentally don\u2019t really get what makes it different, now. An abuser is an abuser, and I\u2019m confident in saying I\u2019d have unfriended the fucker without much hesitation, were I in her position.\n\nIt\u2019s been 3 days now, and I\u2019m getting more and more stressed, and my feelings are all just this big, jumbled pile of emotional turmoil and... I\u2019m at a loss, here. Is my baseline ask of her, or are my reasons for it, or my hurt in response to her actions, unreasonable? And, if anyone has it, advice on what to do here would be appreciated, though that I\u2019ve got figured out a little better, thanks to some of my other friends.\n\nSo HUGE FUCKING EDIT: she cut the abuser off. I\u2019m still hurt and conflicted in lots of ways but a lot less panicked.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

She got angry at me once for being hungry and pulled everything out of the cabinets while screaming at me to eat it all.

You can't raise your voice at her even if she's yelling at the top of her lungs at you. She once got mad at me for her deciding to get up despite me not asking her for help with the situation.

I haven't been diagnosed but I think I have ocd and depression because I have the symptoms for both.

She'll also threaten suicide when she gets slightly upset saying things like \"do you have a noose that I can hang myself with?\" in a joking tone.

(There will be mentions of sexual trauma and physical abuse.)\n\nSo growing up I had a really traumatic childhood. My dad beat my mom to shit when she was 4 months along with me and left &amp; my mom got an absentee divorce. I didn't see him again until I was almost 10. My step dad jumped in when I was a baby and although he was really good with me and later my little brother, he beat the absolute hell out of my mom pretty regularly. He was emotionally, verbally and physically abusive to her in front of us and as such my mom didn't have any self esteem to show of. When I was 9 he nearly killed her and ended up being committed to a mental hospital. We fled the house two days later with a few of our belongings and no clue what was going on. I was 9 my little brother was 6. \n\nWe ended up with my bio father in a different city. Things were okay there for about a year and my youngest brother was born a year after they reunited. After my youngest brother was born my bio father went off the deep end again and became outright abusive and neglectful again.\n\nBy now I was 10 nearly 11 and my paternal grandmother had started grooming and molesting me.  Keep in mind, she'd already let my father and aunt be molested and raped by one of her husbands and regularly used them as drug mules. Nonetheless my father sent me and my brothers over to her house constantly since he didn't want to watch us. \n\nBy the time I was 11 she was taking naked pictures of me, molesting me and grooming me to 'service' the men at her NA &amp; AA meetings in exchange for drugs for her. At age 13 I broke down and begged my father to make it stop, but instead he slammed me into a wall, choked me and called me a 'lying cunt' and that if I didn't shut up he would break my neck. I believed him. \n\nSo it went on for years. Needless to say I was fucked up. I ran away at age 14 but ended up being brought back within 24hrs. I ended up in a violent relationship at age 15 that ended up with me being raped regularly and losing a pregnancy to violent assault at 16 (I was 13 weeks along &amp; kicked down stairs/stomped on) . During this time my dad had committed countless assaults on my mother and basically broken her will. \n\nMy father got a job out of state when I was 17 so we only saw him once or twice a year and it gave us time to heal. But when he came back things always got scary. By age 20 I was still living at home bc my mother was diagnosed with a brain tumor and needed help homeschooling my youngest (autistic) brother. That was the same year he threw boiling water on her because she was smiling and 'being too happy'. \n\nI moved out later the next year with my now husband. I moved several states away and haven't had much of a relationship with my father since. He likes to pretend everything is okay and that he's a good father and none of us are allowed to bring up things from the past. But for the last 3 or 4 years my mother has been healing and getting stronger. this last month she even had the strength to tell him she was done with him and would only stay married to him so he could support her son. \n\nWell during this knock down drag out (verbal) fight she let slip that she knew I was molested by his mom. (I ended up telling her years later when I was 20) and so he called me out of the blue. I picked up and he said \"I have a serious question and I need you to be honest. Your mom just kind of dropped it on me that my mom molested you as a kid? I'm so sorry I COULDN'T be there for you\" I was shocked and angry, he knew what she'd done because I told him. I begged him to make it stop. so I told him \"Yes she did, I told you that when I was 13 and you told me I was a liar and to shut the fuck up. I was stuttering and already on the verge of breakdown. I just told him \"I can't talk about this right now.\" and hung up on him. \n\nMy poor husband had to hold me for 45 minutes while I had a breakdown and ended up nonverbal for a long time. I don't think I've ever cried that hard or been that angry... It was like he decided that never happened to me, he was just going to pretend he didn't know or let it happen. He apparently called my mom back and told her I was a liar after that. She ended their relationship and is hanging on until she can file for divorce. \n\nI know it's irrational but I feel like I ended their marriage. I feel like I did something  wrong. And now I want to tell my father I'm done with him but I don't know how. I'm 23 and married. I have a 4y/o step daughter. I don't ever want to put her in danger and I would no exaggeration kill anyone who did something like that to her. but I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I feel like I can't be the wife or mom or even daughter I need to be if I'm still so broken. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I guess my question is, how do I cut my father off without hurting my  mom anymore than I already have &amp; How do I heal so I can be a good wife and mum?

It would be anonymous &amp; would freak him out. The second part of my plan included contacting his new supply &amp; messing with their relationship. It wasn\u2019t a pretty plan. It was well thought out and vengeful though. \n\nI told a few friends what I planned. Cooler head prevailed, and they reminded me that the Lord says vengeance is His.

Thank you, Google! \n\nThen one reminded me of the grief cycle. Getting out of an abusive relationship can start the cycle. She said it\u2019s not stages you work through &amp; are done.

I know there\u2019s a shit ton of people going through the same thing, and maybe I can help other people in enough time. I\u2019m 18 and I just escaped last week and I\u2019m scared she\u2019s trying to ruin my life. About a week ago my best friend and his mother came to my house after he told her some of the abuse stories I fearfully told him. My best friend, his mother and my family had an intervention for me and forced me to get off the phone with my abuser for long enough for my anger and fear of punishment to lessen enough for me to hear them out. I still wasn\u2019t convinced, but his mother had been thorough a similar situation of narcissistic abuse a couple months back\u2014and simply told me to look up narcissistic abuse. I had already looked up emotional abuse months before and I convinced myself that even if she was abusing me she still loved me. I wasn\u2019t convinced even after the emotional intervention with my family, but I decided to do some research. I found antisocial personality disorder which we briefly learned about in my psych class, and then I found psychopathy and sociopathy which opened the floodgates for me. I didn\u2019t want to accept that this person that had been telling me they loved me and that I had trusted for so long could have been lying the whole time, but I realized this made so much more sense. The abuser had convinced me that she was psychic and could read my mind, so I was terrified every time a girl talked to me that she\u2019d read my mind and find out. She told me she was an \u201centity\u201d and had a higher purpose from the ultimate deity that ruled over the universe, and that I was only a \u201csoul\u201d with no defined purpose, destined to live my life out without meaning. Everything she said made so much sense at the time. She would casually call me stupid often and said I needed to gain 10 pounds in 17 days for her to have sex with me when I saw her, even though I have a hard time gaining weight. I\u2019m about 130-135lbs and have a decent amount of muscle but she still said I was getting too skinny, but wouldn\u2019t let me keep working out because it would mean ignoring her. One of the nicest girls I know was my last female friend and signed my yearbook and said hi to the abuser at prom so the abuser was convinced I was cheating with her, and started screaming and hitting me before taking my phone and telling the nice girl on my Instagram account \u201cI\u2019m tryna fuck\u201d, then threatened to beat her bloody if I ever tried to talk to her or explain that it wasn\u2019t me. I asked her why she would do this to me and that I would never say that and the abuser responded \u201clooks like you just fucking did\u201d. She made sure I never talked to any girls and unadded every female contact I had. She told me she couldn\u2019t hug or kiss or cuddle me anymore because of a sensory disorder and said she was angry at me sometimes because she had a disorder that made her periods last months. She consented to sex and then later said she wasn\u2019t comfortable with what I did to make me feel like an abuser. I eventually ended up crying almost every night, and I\u2019m someone whose never been super emotional, and I started talking to myself frantically and shaking and crying and developing probably some kind of disorder but when I would be panicking talking to myself and sobbing and trembling like a madman she would sit there emotionless and say this is what I deserved. She explained a lot of trust issues on an \u201cabusive ex\u201d who I now know to be another victim and a \u201cmanipulative\u201d stepdad and stepbrother\u2014that I think she made up\u2014that sexually abused her. All the times she would be with guys and I trusted her I now know to be cheating. She threatened so many times that she\u2019d leave me and fuck someone else and send a video, and now I know she fucked them and just didn\u2019t admit it. I\u2019ll never know how many people she cheated with me on and a lot of my memories of the relationship have been repressed by my brain probably to protect me. She told me she loved me and I spent so much money on her to get plane tickets to see her in Florida and she flew up to my prom and ended up leaving an hour in, slapping me and running out crying in front of my entire high school class only to go get drunk and fuck another guy in my sweatshirt. Even then I didn\u2019t leave, and I have known something was wrong for a while, but she\u2019s been telling me some of my friends have been trying to cheat with her and telling me they are stupid and that none of them understand her like I do, which I thought made sense. She made me feel like everyone else in the world was crazy except us and now I understand how smart people get caught up in cults. I\u2019ve always been an incredibly motivated ambitious and driven individual and when we started out I told her I didn\u2019t need a girlfriend, but it was an extra add on to my happiness. She overwhelmed me with praise and sex and got me addicted to the dopamine and chemical responses she invoked. Before long I did end up needing her, and once I started to love her enough, the fighting and abuse started. I know so much of my story is the same with everyone so I don\u2019t need to keep going about the abuse. I don\u2019t like to brag about myself or seem overtly cocky or self absorbed but I have always been the smartest out of my friends and I defeated the demons I had with hard drug addiction last year at 17 to become more focused on myself again, ended up getting 1410 on the SATs after a lot of preparation and got a 4.1 gpa the first semester of my senior year with 3 AP classes while working out and working 30 hour work weeks so I could get good scholarships and so my parents could afford the financial burden of college. I became so confident and knew the drugs would never get the best of me again but it seems like a different type of addiction caught me this time. It only lasted 5 months but it was enough to completely brainwash me and completely change my personality type. I took personality tests before this all and had consistently been either ENTJ or INTJ, but during the relationship with her i got worried about my recent changes and tested myself again to find out that I had became INFP, even though It wasn\u2019t enough to convince me to leave her yet. I\u2019m already starting to become more and more myself, but the only way I could finally break up with her was after the intervention, when I knew she could convince me of anything over the phone, I had to send her a text and block her on everything before reading the response. I did this, and she posted stories on social media after adding my friends and family to convince me to contact her and sent emails threatening to call the cops if I didn\u2019t respond in 5 minutes and tell them she was underage which she was bluffing on and shared google docs that I can\u2019t block her from and created fake Instagram accounts and numbers to call reach out to me constantly for days, all of which I\u2019ve ignored. Her declaration of false sadness at my leaving was all designed using my personality to be exactly what I wanted to hear from her. She\u2019s in college at 16 and is a psychopathic mastermind, and I can not hope to defeat her. I have never said anything negative or insulting to her directly, so she\u2019ll have a hard time using that against me thankfully. Some of my friends tried to contact her like idiots and she threatened to leak my sex tape and or nudes which is also probably bluffs but I don\u2019t care either way I could care less who sees and I have evidence that it was consensual. I have been already talking to other girls\u2014nothing serious but it\u2019s been so long since I was allowed to\u2014and was considering making a tinder although I know I can\u2019t get into a serious relationship for a little while. She posted that \u201cshe found out I was cheating\u201d today almost a week later, and blatantly posts on her story for any guys to hit her up (I\u2019m hoping another new victim does even though it\u2019s cruel just so she will leave me alone) and doesn\u2019t seem to show any signs she will stop harassing and slandering me. I just don\u2019t know what else there is to do at this point. She told me she killed small animals when she was younger and when I questioned her about it she made an excuse and changed the topic. She is a monster and I have no idea the lengths she would go to to destroy me if she made it her mission. We\u2019ve changed the locks in our house and might install cameras but she said one of her crazy friends was planning to cut her exes dick off. I don\u2019t know what is bluffs and what is the truth but I\u2019m very worried about the safety of myself and those I love. She is vengeful because I saw through the lies and ended it on my terms instead of letting her have the power to discard me when she used me up like what seems to happen to so many other victims. I just want anyone\u2019s advice or help as I try and make it to graduation on Friday and to make it through the summer without anyone trying to destroy me. This has been a nightmare and I\u2019ve had constant nightmares about it for the past 5 or 6 nights since I ended it. I\u2019ve been hoping she gave up after a few days of no calls or messages but now she\u2019s decided to move on to slandering me and labeling me a cheater or abuser or something. Please any advice anyone has to offer I\u2019ve never posted to a forum for help or anything like this and it might be a very common experience but I really could use feedback from people that understand since many of my friends don\u2019t really get it and still make jokes about the shit I did for her.

Because I told her I was gonna tell someone about the social services administration incident. I can\u2019t get over it the angry on her face as she said I was the one who lied to them when she made me do it. I didn\u2019t wanna lie to them but I was scared I would get in trouble by my parents if I told the truth to them. Now idk what to do my mom keeps trying to force disability on me. But this time I\u2019m gonna accept it and save that money so I can move into a hotel until I get on my feet she keeps saying she wants me to help her take care of me idk what that even means. My mom doesn\u2019t ever listen to me she doesn\u2019t understand what I need I need professional help medication and to learn how to do things on my own and grow up and live my own life. But she won\u2019t let me she\u2019s been forcing disability on me so she can try to keep this house. Nobody in my house wants to address the abuse that happened in my childhood or the abuse that is happening right now. My sister the day I ran away when I tried being it up I sent her a video on emotional abuse told me I didn\u2019t send her that video when I know I did. I sent it to my little brother 2 big sisters and I think my big brother and my big sister who I sent the video to Denied I ever sent it. And told me she doesn\u2019t think dad is abusive but the day I sent her that video she told me she does think dad is abusive because he\u2019s getting elderly and might have early Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia. She denied I ever sent it to her which made me feel like she was gaslighting me telling me it didn\u2019t happen and than telling me we ever had that conversation in the bathroom about it. I broke on the day I tried to confront everyone that was the day I ran away and called an ambulance and got committed to a mental hospital. And I got out but I\u2019m not doing good again I had another psychosis episode that day I ran away I think. But I remember so many things from that day. And I\u2019m trying to separate what was real from what wasn\u2019t and I know what happened that day. They all denied the abuse and said it wasn\u2019t happening and that dad wasn\u2019t abusing mom all I tried to do was help. But idk if I can if nobody won\u2019t acknowledge it you can\u2019t change something if you first don\u2019t acknowledge it and they won\u2019t even acknowledge that I was abused. My mom was abused dad is being abusive my sister was abused probably my little brother and everyone idk I\u2019m still trying to figure out what was abuse and what wasn\u2019t in my childhood. But I know my sister was physically abusive to me when I was little that I do know I remember it I know it happened I know it\u2019s not in my head I know i was abused I know my sister was too she was mistreated by my mom who took a glass of water and threw it on her. And everyone laughed so there\u2019s just a lot of shit this post is everywhere. But I\u2019m trying to explain myself the best I can. I hope someone can understand do I stop trying to bring up the abuse and just plan my escape quietly? Because idk if I can live at home when nobody is willing to address there abusive behavior either pass abusive behavior or present.

I told him that I don't want to do such things when we met and he was soksy with that. but he wanted me to send him nudes or mastubate on Skype. me, as an naive, insecure and afraid of loosing him, did it. i did it before with other guys so I was used to guys just wanting that. as long as I got the affection I wanted I was okay with it.\n\nbut it got extremer. I never wanted to do anal stuff or putting objects in me. but he forced me to to it or else he would send my previous nudes around. (later I noticed that he didn't know any of my friends, my hometown or my last name. so the chance that the publication wouldn't affect me at all was pretty high) but the pressure he put on me was so high that I did what he wanted for some time.\n\nat some point he forced me to tell my mom about our relationship so we could met. (I never tell my mom about boys and stuff because that's just not what I do. it's a big thing for me to tell her so it as kind of a proof of love for him). and as some of u may know, the most abusive relationships can still be the best as long as u get the love u want. so I still wanted to meet him, too. my mom wasn't happy about him being 17-18 but she was okay with it. he asked me for her number because he \"wanted to buy a present for our first date and he needed to ask my mom a few questions about it\". I didn't think and send it to him.\nobviously he threatened to send my nudes to my mom if I didn't send him more.\n\nthat was enough for me. my mom meant everything to me. if she would have seen them it would have been the last step to commit my suicide. I was so embarrassed. luckily I kept a clear head in that situation and told him thats child pornographie and he's an adult and I could go to court for that. so he stopped. we cut all ties. I'm happy that he stopped but it was a hard time for me. it really killed me. I got diagnosed with depression after all of this.\n\nabout two years after all of this happened he texted me again. we talked a few days but he would always tell me about how horny he is and how he fucks other people. I didn't want to hear that because it brought back the stuff he forced me to do and I was afraid he does that to the other people, too. I tried to cut ties again but he wouldn't stop trying to text me. I told him what he did to me, that I got depressed and stuff but he was like \"yeah, your still crying about haut I did two years ago, bitch\".\n\nI blocked him. should have done that when he asked me for nudes the first time.\nplease be careful, don't let people force u to do anything u don't want to do. never. not even if that's the love of your live.

I have called the police and let them know about all the threatening messages that he has been sending me since I filed for the restraining order and I have now reported this. They advised me to go back up to the store and to ask to see the security tapes from yesterday. I'm almost kind of hoping it was him so that way I'll have proof that he's been following me. I'm just kind of shaken up and unsettled.\n\nI'm not going to be paranoid but at the same time I'm not going to let my guard down. I read that the reason why people will stalk you is because when they have a personality disorder such as NPD, they see you leaving them as an injury. In other words they feel like you toyed with their emotions and played them so they see this as Revenge. They see it as well I'm suffering so you should be too. It's just really creepy and weird to think someone could be following you and watching your every move. Really kind of freaked out right now.

Im stuck in cycles and i haven't gone to a therapist yet, but ive been trying on my own for a few years. During that time though, ive been in a relationship that definitely is unhealthy for both me and my partner. \nCurrently we arent 'together' but he keeps up with being cute, wanting to do sexual things like how we've ways been, which ive tried talking to him about before that we should be platonic if we arent going to be together. \nI think i need to give some history before you can really understand though. \nWe were friends before, but not crazy close, more like aquaintances, but i really liked him for a long time and would try to hang out or be around and it was for sure one sided. Once i started hanging out with him, just us, at his house, it turned to basically me coming over and we'd watch something, smoke, and hed want me to suck his dick basically which i wasnt really signing up for but couldn't really get out of. Sometimes id stay over depending on if he wanted me to. Most of the time id walk to his house which was maybe a 20 minute walk. \nId get involved with other people but never could be in a relationship because of the one id been in before, that was emotionally abusive, 5 years long, before i went cold turkey basically and cut him off. \nAnd while i couldn't be close to anyone i still liked this current guy. So somehow we ended up hanging more, and with other people and we started working at the same place, right near each other so we'd talk a lot more. He came over to my house a lot and would stay over, our work was right by my house. \nWe ended up being together from that. Even when that happened though in my gut it felt like i was still way into him when he wasn't as much, but if he didn't really like me then why would he agree to, when he hadn't been with really anyone? \nSince then he had basically kept staying over at my house,  and ended up basically living there, especially when his mom had to give up their house and he brought a lot of his things to my house (a bunch of boxes of stuff, i can't remember how many), the rest went to his grandma's(dad's mom). So from then he was basically living at my house for a year,  as in sleeping there eating there sleeping there his things were there ( he had two jobs, &amp; the one with me he left and then a few months after that there was problems with the other).\nA few months in, i started having a bad feeling of him cheating on me. We were agreed exclusive since a few weeks in. I looked in his phone,  and found he was. \n~backup to my previous terrible relationship, i would look in his phone to see he was lying and sleeping with other girls and would tell me i was crazy, even though i ended up taking photos of things he would still say it wasn't true and i progressively went crazy in a few months but tried leaving a lot of times on, through 5 years.~ \nSo i asked him about it without saying i knew, and he continuously lied to me and i told him what i did. Obviously he was hurt about it and felt violated which fucks me up. But then thats basically been the repeating cycle for months. Even when he was living with me. I tried leaving him a few times, most he said he was going to kill himself and would blow me up, my phone all my social media, using his moms phone and at times his visiting grandmas phone (mom's mom). Hed threaten to come to my house, that his mom would, that hed do something bad if i didn't answer him etc. So i tried to distance myself, basically trying to be cold toward him or trying to put time inbetween seeing him. I suggested having an open relationship a few times and every time he said no. One time i took some of his things to his mom's temporary place so there was less at my house and less reason he could come back. \nAlso, i lent him money a lot and he said hed pay me back, which he didn't. For things id buy that he said hed give me money for, hed get upset and manipulate me to give it to him anyway. Then hed given me a few things as a way to pay me back a little, but a few weeks later would ask for back and would get mad at me for refusing to, but because he would forcefully take it anyway and i couldn't get him out of the house i had to give to him.\n Eventually his mom got a new place, and he was going to live there, which would be good for me but i was still really depressed about it and i knew id know less of what was the truth when he was gone. The open relationship was brought up again, and he was fine with that now which also was upsetting but i knew it would help him adjust and not want to be together.  So he moved in, the rest of his things out. \nThen it came up that he didn't want to be in an open relationship, and i said okay but we can't be cute anymore or do anything sexual. That was months ago at this point, overall the relationship has been over 2 years. ~the reason for the official not together was basically he couldn't tell girls he was in an open relationship, which i know because i looked in his phone and i think said about~\nThat was a few months ago right, but still now he acts cute, gets upset when say i don't want to do sexual things (mad yelling physically drawing away from me, leaves because hes mad). Even together this would happen but since we havent been ive been trying to stand up for myself more and voice that i dont want to and will get mad and tell him he can go. \nThere are lots of other things that are blatantly disrespectful and are clear he doesn't care as much for me or isn't proud of me, or at least not enough to get in the way of talking, trying to flirt or fuck other girls. He lies about things all the time for no reason. I don't know what to trust.\nThe problem with this is i don't know how to get away. At this point i think ive identified that i use this as a distraction for wanting to kill myself and overall depression etc, because its more intense and overwhelming than my own life. Also a social crutch, since hes in the music/friend scene and i cant get out much &amp; hes better connected. But now how can i still go out and see people i want to be friends with? And go to shows i want to go to? Even locally, im not friends with a lot of people or theres a lot of people who are triggering because of this and the past relationship. I can't keep boundaries or hardly make them. I feel like theres no hope. Id like to get out of my head, travelling helps, if i could move that would be amazing ive been in the same area for all of this. I need help, advice. Thanks if you've read this far.\nPS!!!!! a huge factor to all this is his mom, who is schizophrenic and an alcoholic. He is the younest of her three kids, and hes the one who has been around and trying to be there for her while also doing his own thing most of the time. Its holding him back but he feels a deep responsibility for helping her and being there for her. Its really hard for him, and really hard on him and he needs his support and people to be there for him. A lot has happened to him, and even in the past few years that hes been dealing with, which makes me feel guilty about trying to leave &amp; he also makes me feel guilty for not being there whenever he calls etc. He always says im not there for him. But ive put myself on hold and been there for him how i could. His mom just oded the other day, which is why we are close again because he needed someone close to be there, so me and his bandmate were and his grandma whos been taking care of her basically which is also a whole other messed up situation.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

This indeed inspiring story of my life is dedicated to all of those people out there who are suffering from abuse from their parents, or loved ones. \n\nThe abuse began when I was just an innocent little girl. My father whould do the most disgusting and disturbing things to me that I'm ashamed to talk about. But recently I found a video of me that he had recorded when I was like, 5 years old. In the video he's beating me up and bullying me for having a deformed nose (like it's my fault, right). My mom comes in and asks what is going on, he answers and explains that he is bored, and he is recoding this with intention to show me what a loser I was when I grow old. Well good job dad u did it. This kind of unreasonable abuse (not saying that any abuse is reasonable, just an expression) lasted until I was 16. The moment that completely changed my life happend in a religion class. We had a parenting lesson, what parents shouldn't be like, and what relationship between the parent and their children is healthy. This lesson made me realise that IT'S NOT MY FAULT AND NEVER WAS. I began thinking a lot, and understood that IM NOT ALONE. What I did first was talking about this with my dear Religion teacher, she was very understanding, supportive and most importantly, she taught me that I WAS STRONG and I could do this (I was having suicidal thoughts, obviously). I started going to church more, and eventually found GOD on my side. I feel like the Lord itself helped me through this. So since 16 I didin't let my father do that to me anymore , situation was of course intense, but I always had a safe place in the home of Lord. And yes, by this I mean the church. My dad kicked me out at 17. I began working in bakery of a church and with the help of the whole church community graduated the school. Soon i quit studies and found my place, my happiness in the house of Lord. Now, I'm 23 year old, happy nun. \n\nMy message is, YOU'RE NOT ALONE, there are always people wiling to help you, even if it doesn't seem like it, it's true, because GOD is good, God is the real, the most caring father we all have. You will always find a way to happiness, all u need to do it open your heart, let in the God and follow him. GOD is ALWAYS right. He will lead to the place you belong in.

He asked if I'd come to shoot him (he likes to say this a lot, I don't know why. I've never touched a gun in my life.) Then he got out a large butcher knife and started cutting up frayed computer cables at the edge of the bed. I asked him if I should be worried about him sitting next to me with a large knife after he's been yelling.\n\nHe doesn't like this at all, and turns on one of his phones to record the conversation and starts yelling out \"why did you bring a knife on the bed? why are you moving towards me with a knife? get away from me! You're hurting me! Stop threatening me with a knife!\" \n\nHe sounds so fake and sarcastic it's not like.. a legit recording anyone would believe, but he just kept doing it at me more and more aggressively and it was freaking me out while I was already having a panic attack- and also half dressed so super uncomfortable with being video taped.

I just kinda sunk into a numb space and just did what I was told for the rest of the time there.

I think I just felt so numb and alone and beaten at that point I thought if I'd gone right then it would be to drive off a cliff. So I followed him around while he played pokemon for three hours. My face was badly swollen and I probably looked insane, but I didn't even care. After he was done, he reached over, gave me the first real hug in that entire time, and whispered, \"You know I love you, right?\" \n\nAnd I just dissolved into sobs again, which he acted surprised by. \"Of course I love you. Why do you think I get so mad when you betray me?\"\n\n(Again, the latest \"betrayal\" was refusing to cancel a two night camping trip with friends I'd planned for over two months while we were broken up.)\n\nI know how pathetic I am at this point, I have no pride left to protect. A couple years ago I think if someone saw a video of the way he treats me and the way I keep coming back, I would be mortified. But now I don't even know if I have the energy to care. Sometimes I think this is just who I am- someone born to be used and then discarded as soon as I've been used up.

Married 15 years and own a business together.  \nHis new supply really isn't so new.  She is his 22yo assistant who has worked for us for 1.5 years.  Lots of ups and downs concerning her over that time.  According to him she can run the company blindfolded, but after being his right hand man for over a year she still couldn't count a drawer.  I finally threw my hands up, gave up, opened my eyes and am moving on.  They can have each other for all I care.  \n\nWell 2 Sundays ago they were doing their thing.  He was working while she was off and drinking.  She left work in a company car made it 1 block before plowing into a parked car.  Both cars totaled.  DUI and reckless driving.  I am still 50% owner so I demanded she be let go.  He has been projecting all over the place.  Trying to make it out like I am the bad guy for not being supportive during her time of need.  He is trying to keep her on staff.  I agreed to one week, but he is trying to manipulate every one into her staying.  Oh poor assistant, she's just going to work until she can find another job.  He says they are best friends.  I'm taking odds on how long she stays besties with him after the pay checks stop.\n\nThe rest of our staff sees through his shit at this point.  They are sick of watching her sit on her ass flirting with the boss, drinking while on the clock and making more than them.  We have had an almost complete turnover of staff in the last 6 months.  Today our manager, one of the last people who can run things,  made it clear its her or the assistant.   \n\nSo it looks like his supply is going away.  He has tried to start several fights with me over it, but I am not taking the bait.  I have been his scape goat at work for so long and now I am not around to blame everything on.  \n\nKarma is a bitch.  He is so crushed I almost feel sorry for him.

About two years in, between health problems and just settling into the relationship, I didn't want to have sex so often. If I said I didn't want to, he would keep pushing. He would ask me to touch him or if he could touch me. I would often agree, but only if it stopped there. Then he would push my head towards his crotch. He would start climbing on top of me. If at any point I said I didn't want to, he would give an exaggerated sigh, push away from me and sleep as far from me as possible. \n\nPretty soon, every time I said I didn't want to have sex, he would make a fuss telling me he doesn't feel close to me anymore, chastise me for not being affectionate enough, and threaten to break up with me because he just didn't think it could work out.\n\nMost nights I would just let him do what he wanted with me because it was easier than going through the fight. I know sometimes I couldn't hide the grimace on my face, but he kept going. A few times I couldn't manage to hold back the tears, but he kept going.\n\nThis went on every single night. Eventually I started having recurring panic attacks at bedtime, because I couldn't bear having to choose between having sex against my will, or being told he didn't love me anymore. I would sob, tremble, and hyperventilate, and beg him to give me one night where I didn't have to go through this.  I begged for one night where I could feel safe in his arms and we could just fall asleep holding each other. That night never came.\n\nEventually he broke up with me because he didn't feel close to me anymore. I guess because I didn't want to have sex enough or because I wasn't into it enough when we did.\n\nI don't really know how to process any of this.

We've had 5 arguments in 3 years.  Five.  And it's usually about him being late because that drives me crazy. I got mad at him the other day (for being late) and told him not to come over.  He actually respected that even though it made him mad and we disagreed about the issue, but he didn't try to force himself into my space when I didn't want him to.  I was able to calm down, nothing was heightened.  The next day I wasn't even really mad at him since I was able to chill out.  He came by the next day, acting silly and goofy and it was impossible not to make up because he was just being sweet and cute.  That's a genuine make up!  There was no long, drawn out argument, no shouting, no guilting or demands and insults.  I felt happy and uplifted, not defeated and shitty.  We still don't even agree about the argument we had, but neither of us felt like it was even worth being mad about.  So we just got over it and moved on.  It was so bizarre based on my history with ex, but also so eye opening.  Life doesn't have to be hard every day.  Every argument doesn't have to blow up like Chernobyl.  Then I left for counseling and he cleaned my whole house, walked the dog, and took my teen daughter and her friends to their friend's game.  Seriously, he's the best. \n\nSo!

This happened over a year ago, but I am still dealing with the fallout from it and have been worried about my marriage because of my toxic FIL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBefore my husband and I got married my parents-in-law and I got along very well. They seemed like nice people. Then a few months down the line my FIL started getting increasingly touchy-feely with me. It started off with him trying to hold hands with me and telling me he loved me all the time. I never reciprocated and told my husband I thought it was weird  his father was doing this. Husband just shrugged it off. I figured I could deal with it myself and didn't say anything else about it.\n\nBut then FIL started sneaking up behind me and grabbing me on my hips, my butt, my stomach. In a nutshell, he started groping me. He wasn't discreet about it, either. He did this in full sight of his wife and my husband, both of whom claim they \"didn't see it\". The first time it happened I didn't say anything immediately, but I was extremely disturbed. I did tell my husband the first chance I got though, which was on the same day, at a public place. Again he just shrugged it off. Now he says that I didn't make it clear how serious it was because I told him at the airport and wasn't crying. At the time I thought the fact that my FIL was groping me was serious enough in itself without me having to make a public scene about it.\n\nAnyway, next time we saw the in-laws again FIL resumed his attempts at groping me. Although I did not use any words, I made it very clear that I did not want him touching me like that. I swatted away his hand whenever he tried; I was on edge and looking over my shoulder whenever he was around. He actually responded to that, laughing, saying \"How did you know it was me?\". Clearly he enjoyed abusing me. After he'd said that, again when DH and I had a private moment I asked him to help me. I asked him to tell his father to stop groping me. His response was that he didn't want to because it would upset his parents. I said that he has to tell him, otherwise I will. Eventually he agreed, but instead of talking to his father in person, he texted him saying, \"My wife has a problem with touching.\"\n\nThe next day, after that SMS about the touching, his FIL was clearly looking for another chance to abuse me. He kept trying to run up behind me when we were out on a daytrip. At the end of the trip, I felt something touching my butt and knew it was him. I simply said to him, in a stern voice, \"Do not do that.\". He laughed, as before, and said, \"Why so serious?\". I said, \"I do not like it when you do that.\" Both my MIL and husband were right there and had seen and heard everything. There was just a silence. About two minutes later, my MIL goes, \"That was a nice day.\" Then my husband went, \"Yes.\" Neither of them were being sarcastic. Welcome to the Twilight Zone.\n\nAt the end of the day, I told my husband to have his father apologize to me and make sure he means it and never, ever touches me like that again. He didn't want to. Eventually he agreed to. The apology was something I find very hard to describe. I've never seen anything like it before, except maybe in Michael Douglas films. My FIL said, \"It was just my bag\" (in reference to touching my butt), \"I do this with everyone\" and \"I'm crying!\". (He was not crying; in fact he was grinning and had a malicious twinkle in his eye.) He really put on a show for me and my husband. I wish I had the words to describe how insane it was to witness my FIL manipulating his son into feeling bad for him. He never took any responsibility for his abuse, instead he acted like a sad little boy who should be comforted. I'm pretty sure he was expecting me to fall for his whole act as well.\n\nEnding it there would've been fine with me, had my husband not also acted like a complete psychopath. At the end of that night, my husband was mad at me for upsetting his parents. W.T.F.\n\nThe FIL has been on antidepressants for years. It was also an open secret that he's an alcoholic. Apparently he threatened to kill himself recently, which I gather is why he's allowed to abuse others while no one is allowed to say or do anything to criticize him. My DH has been conditioned to walk on eggshells around my FIL for God knows how long.\n\nLast year my FIL was arrested for drunk driving with a child in the car. Before that he had repeatedly locked his dog in the trunk of his car for over an hour to go out drinking while pretending to his wife he was taking the dog out for a walk. Because of the arrest and DUI his family has had no choice but to acknowledge he is an alcoholic. However they now use the alcoholism as a convenient excuse to say he is not responsible for his behavior. They saw him abuse me and turned a blind eye initially; now they say he wasn't himself because he was drinking. For the record, he was not drunk any of the times he abused or tried to abuse me, and he was also aware that his groping was unwanted.\n\nThere is a lot more to say about this as this happened over a year ago now. My in-laws have constantly tried to re-instate contact with me and have said the words \"sorry\", however without actually acknowledging what happened and insisting that the worst thing that's happened is that I have  broken off contact and that that's especially sad for my MIL. I have sought counseling both for myself and for me and DH as a couple as this has seriously affected me and our marriage. I never reported FIL but have been considering it, as the way he'd been speaking at the time indicated to me that he might be doing this to other women as well. I don't know if it's too late now. He talked about cheating on his wife and molesting women in front of me and DH, however DH claims to not have heard it (this happened several times). Now that he's got the DUI he's gone into mandatory therapy for alcoholism.\n\nFIL and MIL continue to deny and trivialize FIL's sexually abusive behavior towards me. I am unclear on whether the therapy FIL is forced to go to also deals with his abusive behavior besides the alcohol abuse. I am past the point of expecting either of them will ever come clean and have recently gone NC. (There was sporadic SMS contact between me and MIL before this.) The problem now remains squarely between me and DH, whose only emotion appears to be feeling sorry for himself or his parents.\n\nDH has begrudgingly agreed to do couples therapy with me. We're on a waiting list right now. He's become increasingly cold and distant towards me since I decided on the NC. In-laws have started sending DH huge amounts of money since the NC news (for no apparent reason - no birthdays or holidays in sight). What can I expect? I do love DH despite his weird co-dependency or whatever this messed up behavior with his parents is. I do want the marriage to continue. However I don't want my FIL to poison it any further (I have good reason to believe he is trying to poison DH against me).  I find myself wondering if FIL has already destroyed our marriage and it is now just dying a slow death?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: FIL sexually abused me, I asked DH for help but he didn't help because he feels too sorry for his parents. DH and MIL saw some of the abuse. MIL possibly saw all of it but denies and has been brushing things under the carpet. FIL is a psychological manipulator, alcoholic and sexual and emotional abuser. I've gone NC with both FIL and MIL recently. It's been over a year since the last instance of abuse but the fallout is still affecting my marriage. Despite all of this I do love DH and want the marriage to continue. What can I do to stop toxic and abusive FIL from further affecting DH's behavior towards me? We are on a couples counseling waiting list but that's not helping us right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Typos", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He would often bring up ideas of traveling with me, out of nowhere, even before he asked me to be his girlfriend, so I would take it as a sign he wanted things to be more serious. For example, he had to go to Europe for work and asked if I could take time off and even started planning places to go, but then when I pressed for more details so I could look up flights to see if it was within my budget, he would suddenly say everything was up in the air. Then all of a sudden a day before he would say they actually found a way for him to go, but then it was too late for me to accompany him. Another time, he asked if I wanted to drive home (across several states) with him for a holiday week and we even started looking at our schedules together. The next day I asked him about it and he was very vague and non-committal and the whole thing just dropped. Then two weeks before I caught him cheating, he asked me to go on a month long tour with him and we started talking about cities and dates. I am curious if anyone else had experiences like this.

He discarded me when he found another financial supply to buy him another boat after I said no.  He had my \"replacement\" fly in 5 days,  FIVE DAYS, after I left.  He beat her too and eventually she left a few months ago.\n\nSince the day I left him, Friday the 13th of July 2018, I have been no contact, I never looked at his social media and i blocked him everywhere.

It was my first-ever relationship and I didn\u2019t know what a relationship was supposed to look like. I didn\u2019t love her and I was confused/clueless most of the time. \n\nThe physical aspect of the relationship started immediately (literally the day she asked me out and I reluctantly said yes). I never straight-up said that I didn\u2019t want to do something, and sometimes I said \u201cI want to do X,\u201d but most of our sexual encounters involved her initiating them and me going along with them because I didn\u2019t want to make her mad. \n\nA lot of the rifts in our relationship stemmed from sex. I had no sex drive, and she was insatiable. Getting her off felt like a chore and most of the time I just wanted the sexy time to end because it was time consuming and boring. Pretty sure I\u2019m asexual. I didn\u2019t give a shit about orgasming, and when I did, my \u201cperformance\u201d always made her mad because I didn\u2019t make any noise or say anything. She also wanted me to validate her sexually (like tell her that she looked sexy or whatever in lingerie, and me saying that she \u201clooked good\u201d was never good enough). She also denied my asexuality and got mad when she asked me if I was *still* asexual and I said yes. \n\nI think most of the abuse was emotional. Most of the time she would just make me feel bad to the point where I didn\u2019t wanna hang out with her because I was afraid that she\u2019d get mad at me for something. One time she asked me if I was \u201cwet\u201d and I said that I wasn\u2019t sure. This pissed her off because what I said wasn\u2019t sexy. \n\nMaybe in a \u201cnormal\u201d relationship, stuff like this would be weird because I was a clueless Virgin with no sex drive. But she had borderline personality disorder. She had fits when I had never intended to make her mad. She got mad at me for the littlest things, like not touching her or not paying attention to her when I was doing work. Maybe anyone would get mad about that, Idk, but her reactions were so extreme that she told me that if I was ever unsure if she wanted to cuddle, I should \u201ctry anyway\u201d even if she pushed me away. \n\nBut yeah the sex stuff boils down to me being mostly indifferent to not wanting to engage because I had other things to do, was tired, etc. There were a few times where I actually nodded off for a second during sexy time because I was so effing tired and she kept me up because she needed to get off, sometimes multiple times. \n\nI\u2019ll never forget one Sunday where I told her that I had a full day of homework to do - she immediately said that I had to get over to her place ASAP because she was horny. I got there, pulled out my laptop, and she got mad. Then we had sexy time for 7 hours. I was pissed. I wasn\u2019t assertive enough to end it. \n\nIdk if I was \u201craped\u201d perse. Her asking me what I \u201cliked\u201d and her unbuttoning my top without asking me sounds kinda sketch. Her telling me to put my work away and go to her bed also is kinda sketch in my book. Her demanding that I go over to her place to satiate her and me objecting because I had shit to do sounds sketch. But yeah before this relationship I thought I knew exactly what abuse was, and then I found the Gray Area. \n\nOh yeah and before she even asked me out, we were clothes shopping and she legit walked right into my changing stall and watched me undress!

I called him... I opened up the gates of hell and let that Demon in again. I feel so stupid.

My gf said that my spending time with my mom instead of her, I was showing that I thought my mom was more important than her, and she said she won't stand for that in a relationship since she needs \"100%\" from me all the time. I tried to explain that it was mother's day, and that I literally spend every other day with her, but she assured me that she could find someone else who would put her first in every situation.\n\nLater on mother's day when she rushed to my house to take me away from my family's events, I did something stupid.

But, one night I came home with a horribly bruised leg from my girlfriend biting me (my whole knee and upper thigh were purple and green), and my parents said they wouldn't be supporting me going on a prolonged trip when my gf is so violent (I tried to convince them she didn't do anything, but it was pretty obvious), so I was unable to afford the trip and I had to cancel. Ever since, my gf hasn't stopped talking about how my parents hate her and are trying to get rid of her (even though they're surprisingly lenient given all the bruises I come home with and the times I have to leave abruptly in the middle of events in order to not anger my gf).\n\nBasically though, my gf says that staying home is me supporting my parents disrespectful actions toward her, so I must leave and cut off all contact with my family forever or else she will leave me forever. She tells me her parents and all of our friends say its what I need to do, especially since my parents \"have no respect for\" my \"new family\" with her. She says nobody would live in a situation where the parents would defund a trip like that to \"control\" their 19-year-old child (at the time).\n\nShe said it's such an insult that I even express sadness at the idea of having to move out, since I should be thrilled to be away from my \"abusive\" and \"controlling\" family, and now I'm starting to wonder if I really am the problem for disrespecting her. Should I want to move out? Today I tried to argue that my parents hadn't been that bad, and she said it was me trying to \"gaslight\" her, which I definitely wasn't trying to do. I'm so confused. Is this normal? Is it wrong for me to still want to talk with my family?\n\nShe's expecting me to move in with her in less than two days, and I don't think I'll be doing that, so I'm worried about what the fallout will be like that day. Could be the breaking point, so I'm worried about what to expect, then again I've thought other moments would be breaking points in the past but I'm still here.\n\ntl;dr since my gf says my parents have treated her \"ostracized\" her, she says I need to move out of my parent's house and live with her or else she'll never see me again, but I'm not sure my parent have done anything too bad and now I'm questioning everything.\n\nEdit: spacing issues", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I really think that I\u2019ve watched the ex narcissist I was dealing with become a narcissist in front of my eyes.\n\nWe met in middle school. He was pretty nice and laid back. In high school he became extremely cocky and arrogant. It was innocent at first until he started manipulating me in subtle ways triangulating me with other girls and would not answer my text messages and phone calls for days and would come up with excuses for why didn\u2019t answer. He slowly started the cycle with lovebombing , devauling and eventually discarding me several times. He even punched me in my stomach once and when I called him out on it he would say he was \u201cplaying\u201d. He only apologized when I told him over and over how it\u2019s not okay to treat anyone like that. He just apologized so I could shut up.\n\nWhen we became legal adults he didn\u2019t hide his abusive behavior to me at all. He would tell me things like,\u201d I\u2019m the only one that actually cares about you.\u201d, He even hung up the phone in my face and got a temper tantrum over the over when I told him I don\u2019t think its good for us to speak anymore. Currently he\u2019s using multiple people for money, is grooming my replacement while cheating on her and spreading lies about me. \n\nI feel like he became this way because of his family. They have always enabled his behavior when he\u2019s done something completely wrong and his mom seems extremely narcissistic herself. She treats him like he\u2019s the second coming of Christ and like that\u2019s her husband. It\u2019s creepy. This has really messed up the way I view relationships it makes me not even want to have another one. Honestly, I\u2019m scared to be into another relationship.

Today we are supposed to meet up at the zoo so I can spend more time with my exs son.\n\nIt felt wrong when I first saw the boy but after a few mins everything was like we never had been split up.

For the first time in months I couldn\u2019t fall asleep last night and I woke up at 3am. NH and I had a fight. He has been lazy for the last 3 years. His wealthy dad supports him and he keeps coming up with different business ideas. We live with his mom. I\u2019ve been a sahm for 7 years financially dependent on him. It\u2019s a long story.

I don\u2019t get a break. \nThis morning when my husband told me he had a new idea of opening a gym franchise.  (of the gym I started going to 6 weeks ago.) I got annoyed and calmly told him maybe he should focus on all the other things he was trying to do. He got mad and told me I need to take my exam and that I haven\u2019t done shit with my life expect spend his money. He told me that I don\u2019t get special credit for taking care of the kids. I am a hands on 24/7 mom who does everything myself. So it was very hurtful. The other day he was mean to me then demanded I have sex with him and I just did it.  I didn\u2019t want to deal with his moodiness all day. He also accuses me of cheating if I don\u2019t sleep with him. So a quick back story.

The longest we've ever been apart from each other has been 2 weeks.  Needless to say, I feel like I know my wife like the back of my hand, except when it comes to her history of abuse.  \n\nMy wife is reluctant to talk about what she went through during the ages of 6-17.  \n\nHer mom left her dad and immigrated to America when my wife was just a baby.  Her mother would work nonstop in order to hold a room with her extended family, and unfortunately, that's when the abuse supposedly started.\n\nUncle joey(not blood related) was the first, molesting/taking her virginity, then for years would have sex with each other whenever they could.  This lasted around 5-6 years, until her mother remarried and was forced to move into her stepfathers house.  This is when she told me that her stepfather, and step uncles would have sex with her daily while her mother was at work.  So for 11 more years she was stuck in that environment.   \n\nI remember way back in the day, (late 90s) when we were just high school sweethearts.  We'd talk on the phone every night, usually till  9-10, and  she'd tell me that she needed to go and that she'd \"call me right back\" and after 20-40 minutes she'd call me back and resume the conversation.  (i thought she had to go brush her teeth/take a shower or something.  She later told me that during that time her stepfather would come into her room and tell her that it's time to \"have fun.\")  \n\nI also remember at on point, talking on the phone with her while she was slurping/eating ice cream, which she later revealed to me (after we started living with each other) that she was really sucking her stepfathers dick while talking to me on the phone.\n\nShe told me that her stepfather's brother would come to vist her during the afternoon, and would sometimes take turns with her stepfather until they were finished all the while her mom was working next door.\n\nShe  also told me at one point when she was 14, she gave her stepfather a bj during the movie \"Me, myself, and Irene\" while other people were in the movie theater because he told her to.  She later said that they left early so they could \"finish\" at home.\n\nI was her junior, and senior prom date.  Which, She told me she had sex with her after she got home from both.\n\nHer mother to this day CANNOT believe nor will my wife ever admit to her that she was abused.  Her mothers reasoning is, why did her daughter wait so long to tell. I've heard her say that multiple times, to which my wife's body language just crumbles.  Even after we tried to take her stepfather to court.  (which was judged against my wife) her mother stood by her husbands side.\n\nLong story short, my wife got kicked out and moved in with me when she was 17 years old and we've been together ever since.\n\nNow this is going to sound weird but, after all that was revealed to me.   I still don't really know if any of the abuse is really happened.  Over the course of our relationship, she has repeated switched her stance and story numerous times.  She'll say that she was abused and all of that stuff happened for a while, then later she'll say she was never abused, and that she just made everything thing up.  It's flopped so much, that if it happened or not, I came to the conclusion that the only thing we can do is just move forward with our lives.\n\nThen around a month ago, we went to her half sisters graduation party.   Her whole stepfathers side of the family was there, along with her mothers side of the family(her motherside of the family believe my wife was abused).  It has been years since we've had any reasonable amount of contact between them, although we do meet up with her mom at times, but it is always tense.  I didn't want to make a big deal about this so I kept quiet.  (GIGANTIC mistake)\n\nUntil a man  came up and aggressively demanded my wife to give up her phone number and address right infront of me.  The way he asked was like that of a slave owner talking to a slave.  My wife's body language was that of submission.  I was in total shock, I couldn't believe it.  I've never seen my wife look the way she did in all of my time together with her.  It was like all the air went out of her. She quickly told me that the guy wasn't one of her abusers, and was just a 'family friend' so i calmed down and just watched her like an idiot hand over her information.  I didn't want to escalate the situation, which was a STUPID move on my part, because after that.  Her whole stepfathers side of the family started to ask for her phone number and address.  Her mother being on their side then began pressuring my wife to give out our information.  \n\nMy wife's family knows about the stories of abuse.  They also know that she flipflops on the story.  But when that incident occurred, my wife's side of the family and I just stood there while these grown men ages 50-60+ hungrily started hounding my wife for her information.  I am still absolutely disappointed with myself for not doing anything, like my wife, I was like a deer in headlights, I just froze along with her.  It was like i couldn't move or say anything to defend ourselves.  everything happened so fast and aggressively, and amongst all of that.  her stepfather came up to my wife and tried to give her a kiss her in front of everyone, to which my wife woke up and squirmed out of the way before he could touch her.  \n\nMy wife's family, and I still can't believe what we witnessed.\n\ni have been ruminating/going through mixed emotions since this event occurred.  My wife at the moment, has flopped on her story again, and is defending her stepfathers side of the family, saying she wasn't abused.  \n\nI don't know what to say or think anymore.  Even with her side of the family supporting her, it is as if my wife is taking her stepfathers side of the family over us.  My wife gets angry and doesn't want to talk about it at all.\n\nThe situation is just insane, i'm waiting for them to make contact with her, and hoping she chooses to make the right decisions, but since that incident where I froze along with her, I am hesitant to believe she will do anything to defend herself the next time an event like this occurs.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I\u2019m not proud of that but I just wanted him to feel bad for how much he hurt me and I guess I was trying to show him that I\u2019m not unloveable. \n\nAnyway, obviously I wasn\u2019t over him that soon and every once in a while when I feel sad I check his Spotify to see if he deleted the playlists we made. I make a lot of playlists on Spotify and for some reason he thought they were for him even though making playlists has been a thing for me since I was like 12. \n\nHe still has our old playlists and he made a new one recently asking me to call him as the title of the playlist and it just had songs about him wanting me back. I don\u2019t want to because I know this is some sort of a game to him so he knows I\u2019m still not over him. I always did whatever he told me to and I know this time I will be able to resist the urge to contact him. \n\nI still can\u2019t help but wonder, what if I did it? Maybe he has changed? The weird thing is even though he clearly treated me horribly I still think he was the one sometimes because of how good he was to me before things went south or as he liked to call it \u201cwhen his switch flipped\u201d and he realized how awful I am. \n\nI keep thinking if I don\u2019t contact him, maybe that\u2019s my last chance at being with him? I know I\u2019m not over him but trust me I\u2019m dealing with it much better than I was 6-7 months ago when I was begging him to stay. I sleep fine, I go out with my friends, study and I spend time with my family. I just can\u2019t get rid of this one unhealthy habit of overthinking and still kinda thinking I\u2019m never gonna find anyone and that he was the one. \n\nYou can see my other post about details of what he did.  \n\nIt also kinda bothers me that he plays the victim and acts like I\u2019m the one who left him because I was willing to stay and work through things. The songs he posts are just about how I played him and what not, that kinda makes me angry.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I now have to unlearn everything he taught me, which I am with help from wonderful, good people.\nHe would always complete dismiss my experience in the relationship. Say I never loved him, which is the opposite of the truth. I loved him despite how he treated me. Make me into having borderline as an offense, because he cant handle that his abuse created pain? He knows Im not. He acts like he never thought about himself first? What?. He wants others to think I cheated on him? What a fucking projection. Why do they lie to themselves aswell? What does he gain? Not love, thats for sure. I saw something he had written about me on a sub, probably a response to that he found mine as it was everything mirrored back as always, except that I know he loved me at times, or I hope so.\nIve never had to leave someone I love, and its taking a year to finally be able to make that decision. He is probably telling people that he was the one who left as final. He hurt me in so many ways, and Im incredibly sad to lose what I thought was forever. I thought he was my best friend, but he sure didnt feel the same. I thought we had a special connection, but I dont know him at all. He didnt give me a chance to make a real relationship with him. I wasnt allowed in. I never got to know him. But I ruined myself trying and now Im the one who didnt give enough? It was heartbreaking to leave, but being with someone that avoidant breaks your heart everyday if you stay. I hope he'll one day realize that.\n\nCan they ever take responsibility for their actions?\nWill they ever grow up?

He fits the bill of a narcissist. When we were friends, he didn\u2019t show me this side of him. But once he asked me to be his boyfriend, he revealed his true colors. As a background, I\u2019m out to my family and close friends, but he is not. So we agreed that it would be a \u201csecret relationship,\u201d which later on added to the stress I was feeling (since I really couldn\u2019t confide in anyone about the narcissistic abuse).\n\nOnce the honeymoon phase was over, he kept on \u201ctaking\u201d from me and demanded my time and effort for his own agenda, whether it be for his job or his own interests. The relationship always had to be about him i.e. it was one-sided - if something was inconvenient for him, he would disregard it. My little requests for open communication and compromise were not granted. And the first time I raised that we had issues, he ghosted me for almost three weeks. When I gave him an ultimatum that I was going to end it, that\u2019s when he finally agreed to talk, but he acted like he didn\u2019t ignore me at all. Finally, after several more months of the same tiring routine, I had enough and decided to initiate the break-up conversation. It was a mutual decision, though he kept saying that he would like for us to become friends again. I told him that would take time, especially since I invested more in the relationship. The discard was pretty quick - on social media, he seemed to be okay and not affected at all. He even made an insensitive joke that at least he no longer had to turn off notifications for my messages.\n\nIt\u2019s been about a month and I\u2019m trying to go through the process of dealing with the break-up. I haven\u2019t gone full \u201cno contact\u201d though, but I\u2019ve unfollowed and muted him on social media - I haven\u2019t unfriended though because we have the same social circles, which is really tricky to navigate. He has only messaged me once, inviting me to show up to an event where our common friends would be, and reiterating that he \u201ctruly meant it\u201d when he said he wanted to be friends. I didn\u2019t go to the event and I did not reply to his message.\n\nStill, everything that happened has been consuming my life the past weeks and I\u2019m not able to function properly - irregular eating and sleeping patterns, loss of concentration, irritability, you name it. It\u2019s also affecting my performance at work, as well as my relationships with family and friends. For the first time, I had to see a therapist just so I can unload everything that\u2019s been running in my head. I sometimes have relapses and I end up going to his social media accounts to check what he's doing and see if he's flirting with new victims/narcissistic supplies (which he is, with one of the guys who has been blatantly flirting with him when we were still together; imagine, this guy would post tons of pictures with my ex, while I couldn\u2019t do that overtly because our relationship was a \u201csecret\u201d - that made me feel like crap). I just can't stop thinking about everything that happened. I feel so much pain. Sometimes I want to post status updates or articles about narcissistic abuse, if only to warn those around him, especially potential supplies. But I won\u2019t, because I\u2019m not a vindictive person, and doing such things would only inflate his ego even more.\n\nIt\u2019s just so difficult and frustrating. I feel like this is going to drag on for a while, but I look forward to the day when I\u2019m healed from all the hurt.\n\nWould you guys have any advice how to deal with this phase of the moving on process?

My mom (F42) meet this dude (M38 we will call him K) on Myspace around the time that I (F21) was in 1st grade( about 7 years old and my sister was around 4 years old), they got married in 2010 (I was 12, and my sister was 10). Up until they got married things were fine, we were pretty happy. We never called him dad or anything like that, just called him K.\n\nFast forward to my senior year of Highschool(was about to turn 18) and my sisters Freshman year of highschool(15). a few weeks before my birthday(middle of january) My sister comes into my room, crying. She had just gotten out of the shower. I dont ask whats wrong and I just hug her and then she tells me, really quietly what happened. She told me that K was videoing her in the shower, that she saw his phone set up in the bathroom and didn't think anything of it, just thought it was charging. When she got out she thought it was a little weird and so she turned it around and saw that it was recording her. She deleted the video and set it back up like he had it and thought hopefully he would just assume it didn't record. I asked her if this has ever happened before or if he's ever touched her and she said no. I held her and told her when we get to school the next morning we will go talk to the counselor, or the nurse. and get the situation handled. When she left I told her to make sure her door was locked.\n\nThe next morning we get to school and we go to the counselors office, and she isnt in, so we go to the choir teacher because I really trusted her and I didnt know anyone else as well. They call the troopers and they have my sister go and they made me stay behind (which was honestly so stupid but whatever)\n\nOnce my sister was there they called my mom, and asked her to go down to the station (or wherever I can't remember where) to talk to her, she then got really upset and called me and was screaming at me about how dare you not tell me first and blah blah blah and she talked to K before she went even though they told her not too. She eventually makes it down there (i stayed with a friend that night) and they both make statements. and then eventually they go to the house and talk with K and he admits to having done this once before but he just deleted the video, because he felt \"bad\" and just \"couldn't watch it\" and then my sister deleted the second one. So he claimed he has recorded her twice, but did not watch the first one, and couldn't watch the second one.\n\nHe goes to jail for a few weeks, because my sister told the judge to make the call. she didn't want to deal with the situation anymore. It took MONTHS for him to finally get a sentencing because his lawyers kept trying to get the time down. My mom justified this because he had a job and needed to pay his bills. at the time (and currently) both of their names are on all of the bills for the house. and my mom didn't have a job then, and so apparently needed his help.\n\nwell it has been 3.5 years and she is still with him, she keeps saying she's going to divorce him but she doesn't, she frequently calls him on the phone, texts him, watches the house when he's away for work, her dog lives at his house etc. She has her own place with my sister, but she still has a lot of things there, and spends a lot of time there.\n\nFast forward to today -- I get a call, my mom has fallen and is going to the ER because her knee is super messed up and really swollen. I asked her why she fell, and she told me she was out at K's getting his keys and she fell over some chopped wood. She told me she hasn't told anyone else because she's worried that they are going to be mad at her and talk badly about K, and she said \"I am fragile right now, I can't take the abuse\" and she then goes on to bring in my marriage and said \"if your wife did anything to piss you off I hope that you wouldn't just throw away your marriage, especially if she was remorseful and served her time and is trying to change\" LIKE EXCUSE YOU getting pissed at your significant other is a little bit different than PURPOSELY TAKING VIDEOS OF YOUR DAUGHTER IN THE SHOWER WITH THE INTENTIONS OF BEING NASTY. after all of this has happened my sister was deeply depressed and anxious, she developed PTSD and OCD, she frequently talked about wanting to die.\n\nAnd before you guys try and invalidate the situation, I realize it could have been worse. I know that he could have done much worse to her. He caused so much trauma to her, and she will have to live with that for the rest of her life.\n\nI have a few questions -- how would you react in this situation? and why is my mom still with him? Should I just avoid the topic and keep my mom in my life? Should i limit contact?\n\nTL;DR My mom is still with her husband even though he video taped my sister in the shower - she's equating it to getting pissed off and I don't know how to react to the situation. How would you? why do you think my mom is still with him?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

My nex bled me dry; when we broke up I barely knew what was real, I thought I was a crazy, cold, drama-creating, heartless piece of garbage that could do nothing right. As time passed after the breakup, I started to read about emotional abuse, manipulation and gaslightning. I was shocked and stunned. Everything matched, almost down to the final letter. It all started to make sense; his accusations, his rage, his endless monologues of how bad I was and that I needed to go to therapy because I was crazy and so many more things he did and said. Finally I came to accept it; my experience was one of emotional abuse, along with sexual abuse and coercion. I didn't want to believe, still don't want to believe that someone could hurt someone like that on purpose for their own selfish reasons. It is one of the things I'm still struggling to come to grips with.\n\nYesterday, I found out that my nex has a new girl who he has moved in with less than a year after his last attempt at love bombing me.

He never touched me, only locked me in closets and threat, because I wasn't his child nor truely my mother's. But, of course I would always tell my father only about my brother's beatings, even at a young age, he came first. My father never cared, but my step mother was concerned and that made him slightly concerned, but he mostly ignored it. Then on one visit, she began hitting him, and would sometimes brag about it to me, I would smile and nod, but as soon as back were turned, I gave my brother all the love I could give, and always told him, if it even got so bad, I would hide him at my house.

For reference my sister-in-law lives many states away, and she is there without any of her family.\n\nRecently (1 month ago) my sister-in-law decided to leave her abusive husband after she had finally gotten fed up with a list of wrongdoings. She got her own apartment, and told him she was leaving so they needed to come to an agreement about their son (&lt;1 yr old). He was furious at hearing this, put his hands on her and told her if she ever came back to their shared home he would kill her while claiming she was an intruder. \n\nSo she left, she tried to be civil he wasn\u2019t having it. They got lawyers as they went through the process. She felt lonely at times, but she was also sure that she was taking the right action even if it was being hard on her. I\u2019m close to my sister in law, and even more so this last month. We talked almost everyday, and then all of the sudden I get a strange text from her which was just the thumbs up emoji. The following day, my wife hears from my SIL who tells her that my SIL and Brother in law are back together. However, the words seem forced.\n\nLater on we find out that all of my SIL friends and family got similar messages that didn\u2019t sound like my SIL. My wife tried calling her but she wouldn\u2019t answer. Eventually she picked up only after my wife threatened to call the cops. They talked, but my wife felt like everything my SIL was saying was forced \u201clike she had a gun to her head\u201d. This was Monday. Since then my SIL refuses any video calls, citing very weak excuses, and photos. My SIL\u2019s social media accounts are all disowning her friends and family, saying they will never be friends again or be close because they support her leaving the abusive spouse. My SIL had ONE local friend, who hasn\u2019t seen her since Friday. Apparently my SIL quit her job that she loved and was creating a career with.\n\nMy wife\u2019s family and I are terrified but we are all too far away to help her or see her in person. I\u2019m at a loss at what to do, and I\u2019m scared for her safety. Anytime someone tries to talk to my SIL she says she\u2019s fine and that it\u2019s her choice but no one is buying it.

This is really difficult for me to talk about as I feel guilty for even thinking about it, but recently I feel as though it's becoming more of an issue with my relationships. \n\nI was around 6-7 when I think this may have happened, and I had a recurring \"dream\" (I'm questioning whether it was a dream or just me repressing certain events) of an older man coming into my room at night and asking me if I wanted my blanket. I would be extremely scared and I think I peed myself sometimes, but I don't know for certain as that period of time is very very vague in my memories. The man would then come closer and closer and I would whisper \"no\" until the red blanket obscured my vision. I would then wake up in the morning and cry by myself in my room. I also would be half awake sometimes and feel like I was being moved around (sliding up and down on my bed, being moved to face the wall or the doorway instead of staring at the ceiling, mostly sliding though - it would feel as though my bottom half was being lifted into the air and I was sliding) I don't remember if there was any physical evidence of abuse, but I asked my mom about it recently and she told me that it may have just been my grandfather coming into my room. The issue with her saying that is the fact that my mother had watched my dad physically abuse me during the ages of 10-13 and pretends now that it didn't happen when I'm almost completely certain that I saw her watching him hit me from in my doorway. On top of that, my mother has a bad relationship with my grandparents, so I don't trust what she has said very much. \n\nI've had \"flashbacks (?)\" (I don't really know what is considered a flashback) of my father touching me but I can't tell whether I'm making it up or not. I feel uncomfortable around my father and have felt this way for a long time. He always makes comments about how he couldn't wait for me to grow up and has commented on my body multiple times (telling me to wear tighter clothing and made remarks about my breast size). I don't know whether or not this means anything. I love my dad, but I also hate him for the pain he inflicted on me physically. I don't know if I've been having these \"flashbacks\" because I don't like him and want to have a reason to not like him or because it actually happened. That makes less sense when I write it out yikes. \n\nI have sexual fantasies of being choked to death (my father has choked me and told me he would kill me), being raped, and being molested. I don't know if this is anything of importance but the few people I've consulted on this matter (NOT MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, my close friends) have said that it may be for a reason. I have problems with people touching me first (tapping me on the shoulder, hugging me, patting my head, etc) but I don't know if that is because of the physical abuse or something else. I also have trouble putting in tampons or masturbating and when I attempt to insert things I start crying and it hurts even if there's barely anything in (sorry thats really graphic sorry). \n\nAnyways, this was really long, I'm sorry but I'm debating seeking professional help again because it's becoming hard to cope with these feelings I have. If anyone could offer advice or opinions on what may have happened I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I thought this was normal. like i did something wrong, i deserve it. After the arguement cooled off she would call me into her room and apoligize and say how she doesn't like to yell at me like that but I needed to learn my lesson. Also  when she snapped at me she would say that she's ill and her back hurts. As I got older she got lazier. she would blame it on her depression and her back problems. She would make me do the simplest things like getting her a bottle of water or to heat her up some food. but it got to the point she would do it every time she needed something. she never got out of the bed unless she had to use the bathroom or take a shower. and if we needed to go grocery shopping she would have me go with her and i would run in and get everything. I would do all the cooking for five (me,my brother, my grandmother,my mom, and my uncle). and I would have to do all the cleaning. If i were to ever complain about it I would be reminded of everything my mom had done for me and then be told how ungrateful and unappreciative i was. fast forward to this time last year. fathers day.  My grandmother and my mom got in a fight because of how my mom treated me and she told my mom to get out. she said she could leave her with us until she found a place but needed to help with food and everything but she still took us and we went and stayed with my best friend at the time for a week. but my mom then went to the hosptital for a pancreaititis attack and left us with her parents to look after us. after we were told to get out and we had to go back to my grandmothers. at this time my mom had brainwashed us to make us think our grandmother was to blame and that she was abusive and we couldn't trust her. When my grandmother was the one working 80 hours a week to keep a roof over our heads and was never home. another month later got into the same arguement but this time my mom just took us without my grandmother saying a word. we then went to say at  her friends house for about a motnh my my mom would never help out. at this time she got a boyfrined and was always leaving us to go hang out with him. the whole mother we were there she was only there for about a week. then when we had to leave she went to her boyfriends after like not even a moth of dating and leaving me with the girl who is still my best friend to this day and putting my brother with our dad. we stayed were we were for about 4 months and i had to leave bc their grandmother was comeing to stay and they didn't have enough room. So i went home to my grandmother after having no where else to go. after hearing i was back home my brother came back home and my grandmother then explained to us all the stuff we didnt know that my mom didnt let is see. My mom tried to keep us away from our grandmother so we would favor her more. my mom would always say stuff that made her look bad that wasnt true at all. And when i actually thought about it my grandmother had never laid a hand on me she never said anything bad towards me and shes always done what she has to do to take care of us. now we are in the position that my mom has me and my brother with my grandmother and isnt giving her anything to take care of us. she gets child support food stamps and disability over half of all the money she gets is supposed to help take care of me and my brother but she always has excuses. she has also went on facebook and told a bunch of lies about my personal life and i told her to take it down but she won't.

He also told me once that he fantasized about kidnapping his exes because both of them left him (and one of them was 14 years old when he dated her as a 19 year old) and killing himself in front of them, or leaving a suicide note that just said \"it's YOUR fault\" without being addressed to anybody specific. \n\nDid he abuse me emotionally until he thought he could get away with violating me?

We arrived at around 1pm, and planned on studying until the place closed at 9pm. After that, she promised that we'd \"go to the grocery store and have a good dinner.\" Even though I had only eaten a slight breakfast earlier in the morning, I had a granola bar to keep me going, so this plan seemed good.\n\nSeveral times throughout the day, whenever I mentioned how hungry I was, she'd tell me to picture that dinner. Fine.\n\nWell, 9pm finally rolled around, and we drove to the grocery store (a special one we don't usually go to). As we walked toward the entrance, she says \"now I just want to let you know we're just getting one small box of macaroni and cheese.\" This stunned me, since I had been craving tons of food all day long. I had thought the point of the grocery store was so that we could pick out a few things for our dinner.\n\n\"Oh, well I'm gonna need a bit more than that\" I replied, not knowing the craziness I was about to start.\n\nShe froze in the middle of the parking lot. \"I changed my mind, we're not going in there anymore,\" she said. \"Take me home, now.\"\n\nShe stormed back into my car and demanded I take her home or she'd call her father or an Uber to pick her up. I begged to go into the grocery store, and she just looked at me and gave a bloodcurdling shriek. To stop the screaming, I drove her home, and she immediately relaxed, but she didn't much on the way home, except for stuff like \"you eat too much and you don't need more than a little bit of food each day. American portions are too big, etc, you don't want to become fat like your parents.\"\n\nThe moment I pulled up at her house, she stormed out of my car, went into her car, and drove away without saying a word. I started following after her in my car, but I lost her, so I drove to the house of the dude she triangulated me with in the past to see if she had gone there (I noticed she had been texting him recently after several months of what I assumed was no contact).\n\nHer car wasn't there, so I drove back to her place, where she had just gotten home. She had purchased some bread and a box of macaroni and cheese, and I was so thankful and happy that she had gotten food for us that I didn't even bring up the problems and we sat and watched TV together\u2014the rest of the night was pretty good.\n\nAnyway, this situations makes me wonder 2 things:\n\n1.

Boyfriend often makes me feel like I'm inferior to him or feel like I'm stupid by treating me like a child basically, laughing when I'm trying to talk to him about something serious (even though I've told him multipe times I think that is offensive), constantly questioning my opinions and pretty much everything I say and so on. \n\nAlso thinks that by defintion I'm wrong and he is right so when I call him out on something mean he said. For example like today when I called him out about saying how I'm complaining too much when I said that I'm in pain and that's why I'm complaining (I have some chronic issues that are getting worse ), he responend with \"You must apparently always be in pain then\" hinting at the fact that I'm always complaining I guess. So then he proceeds to act like everything is fine while I'm hurt and I distance myself away. This was yesterday and today I tell him that it hurt me (on his request because he noticed I was mad at him but didn't see what could be hurtful about the situation) and I recalled the situation so he could remember what he said. He then goes on to tell me that what I'm saying is a lie, that he meant something else and I just couldn't understand him AGAIN (he always says that I don't get what he's saying). Also starts telling me how it's actually me that's twisting his words because \"I have a pattern of trying to find something to fight about\" and because at that point I was done and just wanted to stop this convesation, I just told him that he's either going to stop lying and apologize properly or stop talking to me to which he responds by pretty much making fun of my, by saying what I told him sounded \"braindead\" and that I was acting ridiculous for supposedly wanting everyone to agree with me? \n\nHe does that pretty often. Saying I'm wrong just because he thinks that by definition he is right and because \"I have a pattern\".  Sure, I have my own faults and I'm trying to work on that but I feel like how he treats me sometimes is very abusive? I always hate the fact that he makes me question everything which is now starting to affect me in my day-to-day like too.  At the same time though we live together and I'm very financially dependable on him at the moment as my parents are also quite abusive and I'm trying to distance myself from them. So he's paying for pretty much everything which makes me think that maybe I'm just too ungrateful? He can also be great though and I know for sure that he loves me but some of the things he does make me feel so bad...It's also things that we've already talked about before a million times, although he's definitely worked and fixed some of the stuff I had issues with before. So...I really don't know what to do.

Please tell me whether you think he is a narc and why...\n\nSo, long story. I\u2019ll give you all the details. \n\nwhen I first started crushing on my husband, I met him at college. He was 8 years older than me and I thought he had the nicest eyes I had ever seen, and that was that. I was 18 at the time and he was 26. But I stopped talking with him and reconnected when I was 21 (him 29) we started dating.\n\nI seriously admired him so much. He seemed like such a Christian person. I was very zealous (honestly kind of a jerk too) at the time. Always going on about Jesus. Sure, I love Jesus and all, but I\u2019m not that way anymore. Anyway... he seemed to be the same. \n\nHe had a Christian band and all of his songs were actually very good (because you know how  Christian music can be...ugh) he actually had a Dave Matthews, punk rock vibe to his songs that were very good. He was very artistic like me in every way. I was just so head over heels. Blinded by admiration. \n\nWhen we were dating, he would want to make out all the time (super Christian, right?) which, usually I wouldn\u2019t be okay with but I just wanted him so bad. But as a religious person I didn\u2019t want things to go too far. I would tell him about something that bothered me that he did I\u2019m taking it too far but he got irritated with me. So I stopped bringing it up. \n\nThen, about 7 months into dating, he informally proposed to me. I said yes. I was pretty naive honestly. I had such blinders on for him. He seemed like such a Christian guy. But the thing I didn\u2019t acknowledge was that he was almost always irritated. Always complaining about something. He was pretty much always couch surfing. Staying with random families, and he really violated my sexual boundaries. we never fully went all the way while dating or engaged, but he was all over me. All the time pretty much. \n\nI think back to that and I am embarrassed for myself because we would go to social functionings with other Christian people, like the drive in theater. And we would be unabashedly making out in the back seat and making all of our friends uncomfortable. Ugh.., cringe. \n\nAnyway, so he was all over me, up to the wedding day. Then after we got married, it was like a light switch. It was like we did our business for the first time and he wanted nothing to do with me.\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to sleep in the bed due to back problems, which at this point I don\u2019t know the extent of the problem. I think it was an excuse. He did get back surgery but we never shared a bed and still don\u2019t. But when he went over the road as a truck driver (he changed careers once our son came) he could sleep in the bed in his tractor trailer with no problems. \n\nAnyway, I would try to dress up for him in sexy ways and he would tell me \u201cyou don\u2019t do this\u201d. And I was fucking humiliated. Then I would try to initiate sex and he would be irritated and make excuses. I would feel so ashamed so I stopped trying. \nTo him, everything seems to have to be in order around the house. But then when I put it in order, he is annoyed with the way I did it. I feel like he wants to control everything. \n\nI am extremely artistic, but I feel I can never be better than him or else he will not like it. I am an amazing singer but any time I sang around him, he would just get awkwardly quiet. He wouldn\u2019t tell me my voice was great (because it is) but then he would be listening to someone else\u2019s music and saying how amazing it is. It seems like it was just to rub it in my face, but of course he denies any of that motivation. So I literally cannot sing in front of him to this day. I don\u2019t feel any encouragement from him so I don\u2019t feel comfortable. He goes on about how art, etc is a waste of time now. He doesn\u2019t do any art anymore himself, although he is very good. Also, he doesn\u2019t go to church anymore either. I tried to go on my own but he has subtly discouraged me. \n\nSo, there wasn\u2019t a lot of overt insults. But this underlying current that still exists. I feel like he thinks I am lazy. I can feel it in the air even though he doesn\u2019t say it. \n\nI work my ass off for our 2 kids but I know he thinks I am lazy. \n\nAnyway, about 5 years into marriage (8 months ago) I find his porn. And yeesh, let me tell you... the shit I have seen. Very unChristian. Lol\n\nBut the way he treated me when he was deeply involved (8 months of really active porn use) it was a nightmare. He would flirt with people in front of me (who I suspected he was into to begin with, which was true) he would ignore me and not talk to me for months. I had no clue what was going on, but I felt like a piece of garbage being thrown to the side night after night. I cried myself to sleep and daydreamed about my ex all the time because I felt like utter shit. \n\nIt turns out, he was involved in porn since day 1 of our marriage, etc. he had a string of girls he was interested in, including a mutual friend, and a current coworker. His past relationships were with women with really low self esteem. I seem to be the only one with high self esteem, although I was naive at the time. I really had a weakness for sex as well because it was my thing before coming into my faith. So he used that to keep me intoxicated and ignorant through dating up until marriage I think. \n\nBut anyway, it has been 8 months since this discovery and I have PTSD now. I am in therapy, 12 step group for partners of sex addicts, and am on antidepressants. I am working on not giving a shit about his opinion about me or any woman because I will feel like utter shit if I let his opinion of me matter. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t just the porn though but the ignoring, the subtle belittling, the flirting with women in front of me, but it was so covert that it made you question yourself but it also made you feel like shit too. \n\nAnyway, I feel like this ruined person. Since discovery, he hasn\u2019t really been showing any empathy. The only time he seemed to show any change was when I went home to my moms a few weeks ago just to clear my head. I stayed there 8 days. He hardly contacted me, seemed to not want to see the kids, came up to visit one day, but the only time he said anything reassuring was when I was about to come back. He told me that he was training himself to just have eyes for me, and that he wants to write a book about it because it was such a revolutionary idea. It seemed we were better than ever.\n\nNow I feel it going back to where it has always been. He comes home, tells me about his day, and plays basketball video games and screams at it while I take care of the kids. Then we sleep in separate beds. He does come in and kiss me and tells me something affectionate and then goes to work. But it all feels like a check on a list. \n\nBut when I was away with my mom, he wanted pictures of me so he wouldn\u2019t turn to porn. So I gave him a couple. I felt uncomfortable doing it. But then he is telling me now that I am home, that he is using the pictures throughout the week and that he wants more. It has already replaced our sexual energy together and I am not giving him any more. But I feel things are headed right back where they were last year when I first discovered this shit. Now it just happens to be pictures of me he is replacing me with. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think? Is this a narc or is this just a guy with serious sexual issues?\n\nHe did seem like the guy who always wanted to help people out at his own expense. He was even part of a cult in the past that broke him down and he let them, so that makes me think he isn\u2019t because usually narcs are leading the cults. \n\nThat particular cult really sexualized women though and he definitely is about that. I wonder what happened in that cult. I had tried contacting exes, who mentioned girls from the cult in an email exchange. My husband said she was accusing him of something that wasn\u2019t true, but the one he was with during his cult experience won\u2019t answer me back and I need answers that he won\u2019t give. \n\nAnyway, I am just all types of confused. But going off of this information, can you tell if he is a narc? I watch narc videos and sometimes I\u2019m like \u201cyep\u201d but other times I am not sure. \n\nI sometimes think he has a hypersexual disorder, but the light switch when we got married of him not wanting me at all is confusing. Sure, he was turning to porn and nothing vanilla either. So maybe he was burnt out on that? I don\u2019t know..\n\nLet me know your take.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She came up with something, like painting door frame when I was at work. \"Why didnt you bought correct paint, I cannot do this without proper paint? You are worthless.\" Of course we do not have a special paint for door frames at home all the time. Who does? \nBeeing sick? Flu/cold/etc. \"Why you are sick? I will get infected from you. How could you do this to me.\" Then when I will feel really bad she is already gone to some of her friends.\nVacation in 24/48 hours? Someones wedding? \"I do not wanna go. Go there yourself.\"/\"I do not have proper clothes\"/\"I am tired\"/etc. Terror, stress. What have I done wrong this time?\nChoosing presents for my birthday? \"No, not this. You should have xxx or yyy. But you know? I do not care.\"\n\nQuarrel with her? There is literally no point of having any argument with her. Her response is ALWAYS the same, \"BUT YOU...\"/\"YOU...\". Transferring blame to my site. No matter the problem. She used all the toilet paper? \"Why didnt you bought more in the first place\". She broke the vase while trying to clean in? \"Why didnt you do this yourself? You are NEVER thinking about stuff like this.\" You get it right?\nProblematic things. \"Did you find the bailiff?\", \"No i did not, your friend is one, you told me that she will take care of it.\" \"Of course, everything is on me. You lazy shit. Call her and find out. Find her number yourself. I am done with this.\"\nClothes? I am always wrong. \"This shirt is awful. Change now.\" \"We do not have time for this, we are already late. shirt will be fine.\" Answer? \"So go alone, I am done with your shit\".\nTERROR? I am at work. She is at home with our son (3 weeks old). \"I am fed up with him. I am going to leave him here alone\". Then she turn off her mobile.\n\nI thought that relationships/marriage looks like this. That someone always must be a \"winner\". Compromise is a failure. You have to win at all costs. I tried to negotiate, explain. These are signs of weakness. After all, I am \"weak\", \"arrogant\", \"churlish\", \"soft\" or \"unmanly\".\n\nThese are only examples of my marriage. There is much, much more. Every day I discover new layers of my mediocrity.\n\nBut something changed. Narcissists, or at least SHE, constantly compare themselves to others. They must be much better, or a lot worse than all others. What is the best way to have a better mood than someone else? Destroy his mood. In my case, my mood. Constantly.\n\nAfter years of such \"therapy\" I stopped taking care of her happiness. I started to make sure that she was not always dissatisfied with everything I was doing. The intention has changed. I stopped looking at her as a person close to me. She has become a problem that I have to solve constantly. Love has disappeared. Suddenly there was jealousy about our dog or about a newborn child. \"It is always the dog, fuck her if you want! You dont care about my needs!\"\n\nNarcissists destroy our love for them. They destroy trust, respect, attitude. They burn our feelings to the ground and the sprinkle remains with salt. \nI'm afraid that I will be like her. That I would not be able to be happy.

(Post writing note: sorry this is so long and probably overly convoluted. It makes sense to me, as best it can anyways given the circumstances)\n\nI was driving home and for some reason got to thinking about my older brother. When I was a kid, he used to abuse me physically and emotionally. He always bullied me, picked on me, called me names, and even beat me up as we were growing up. He told me once that he knew he hated me the day I was born. Thinking back on it, I believe him. What else could you feel for someone that you made suffer so badly?\n\nNow, I've always known he was abusive in these ways, but today I randomly thought about something else. I have never suppressed what happened, and I never thought of it as abuse. I enjoyed it, honestly. I never had \"the talk\" with my parents, so I certainly didn't have any understanding of sex back then and he probably didn't have much more of an understanding than me. But, then it dawned on me that I'm roughly 5 years younger than him, and I was probably 8 or 9 when it started. Which would have made him a teenager. He was taking advantage of me. What he was doing wasn't innocent, it was sexual abuse.\n\nI know I haven't said what was actually done, and my hands are shaking so bad right now I can hardly type. I don't remember how any time started, but eventually he would ask me to do different stuff with him. Sexual stuff. I always said no, except for blowjobs. He used to give me blowjobs. My ~13 or 14 year old brother used to suck me off when I was only 8 or 9.\n\n(I literally just threw my phone down and covered my face with my hands after typing that last sentence. I'm so disgusted with just the thought of it.)\n\nI was driving home when I finally realized that my older brother used to sexually abuse me. I pulled up to a red light with my mouth hanging open as tears began to well in my eyes. I've since come to terms with all the physical and emotional abuse he put me through, but this is different. I wanted to puke. I got home and just sat in my car silently for awhile before going in. I had been thinking about so much that I just didn't know what to do. I finally decided I didn't want to be outside where people could see me and went in my apartment only to drop my breakfast on the floor and wrap myself in a blanket on my bed. I think I felt every bad thing I could possibly feel. Sick, disgusted, ashamed, scared, broken, sad, afraid, I don't know what else.\n\nI still don't know what to do. I want to talk to somebody but I don't know who. I just don't know where to turn with this. I'm 30. This shit happened, and eventually stopped, nearly 20 years ago now. How can I have never realized that what he did was abuse? I keep trying to rationalize it, but I know it was wrong. I know he probably didn't know much more than I did at the time, but why couldn't he just get a girlfriend? or a boyfriend I don't fucking care. Why did he have to use me like that? He took advantage of me and there's no excuse for that. I don't care if he was 13 or 31, it was still abuse. And it was a fucking disgusting thing to do to a fucking child.\n\nI'm sitting here thinking about all the stories I've heard and read and all the advice I've seen given, and even given myself. And now I'm terrified. I have another brother, younger than me, who he also abused physically and emotionally. Did he take advantage of our little brother, too? When we moved away from each other, did he start abusing someone else? What did he do in his high school years when he didn't have me to abuse? He certainly didn't run with any of the good kids. He got in trouble with the law more than once. He wasn't a good person by any account. I wonder if there's been anyone else. He's married with kids now. What the fuck is he doing behind closed doors? I'm certainly not accusing him of anything, but I don't know of a single abuser who ever stopped who isn't dead or in jail.\n\nWhat the fuck am I supposed to do? The only person I ever told of the physical abuse was my mom, long after my parents divorced. I don't even know if my dad knows about it. I don't know who to talk to about my own problems. But, I know I really want to tell his wife. I want to talk to her, far away from him, and tell her everything. She has a right to know, doesn't she? I don't know who my brother is anymore. I thought he was a better man, but can somebody really change that drastically? I'm talking about a person who abused his own brother in every way possible.\n\nI don't fucking know what to do. I can't even stop my hands from shaking right now. I just want to disappear. I feel so gross.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

The first couple weeks he was a smooth talker, romantic, knew all the right things to say. Then he\u2019d pull out excuses, \u201cI want to be independent, I think we should stop talking\u201d then two days later he\u2019s texting me at 3am, drunk, telling me he misses me and wants me to come over. Of course I fell for it over and over again because well, I cared and he was good at keeping me wrapped around his finger. This continued for 3 months, where things are good one week and off the next. \n\nWhen we\u2019d hang out I\u2019d see other girls texts pop up in his notifications and I\u2019d confront him on it and I\u2019m told I\u2019m \u201ccrazy\u201d because they\u2019re \u201cjust friends\u201d. Turns out every time we were not talking, he was sleeping with other girls just to hit me up two days later to tell me he misses me and start the cycle all over again. He never wanted to define our relationship, he never wanted to commit. Any time I tried to move on and start seeing other people he\u2019d get upset with me, block me for a few days, then come back to tell me he was in love with me (something he told me the second week after we started hanging out), that he wanted to be in a relationship. Would ask me if I\u2019d marry him, move in with him, have a baby with him. He\u2019d never actively make plans with me. I was always the one to contact him. If I didn\u2019t, I\u2019d go days without hearing from him. Or if I didn\u2019t respond back to him immediately, he\u2019d blow up my phone and get upset with me. \n\nWell he broke up with me a couple days ago because he wants to be \u201cindependent\u201d and that we just \u201caren\u2019t compatible\u201d but that he\u2019s in love with me and I make him happy. But found every reason to blame me. One reason was that he was upset that I would like some guy\u2019s pictures on Instagram. I later found out he told his friends he wants to be single for the summer and when I confronted him on it, I was met with extreme defensiveness, anger, and was told I\u2019m \u201ccrazy\u201d. When I told him he all he did was treat me like shit, he talked over me and told me I was \u201ctoo much\u201d and \u201ctoxic\u201d.\n\nI bent over backwards for him and all he did the entire time we were together was gaslight me, make fun of me, come up with every excuse for us being incompatible. Told me he thinks I might be \u201cretarded\u201d because I didn\u2019t know of some band he liked. Made fun of how I dressed, my hobbies, the music I listened to. Overall gave me terrible anxiety and made me feel so insecure and now that he\u2019s gone I feel like every little piece of me has been stripped away, and feeling like maybe I was the problem. I feel like an empty shell and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Somehow, the conversation ended up on the topic of awkward sexual experiences, and he told me about a time when he was a lot younger and had a one-night stand with an older woman. He played it off for laughs. I didn\u2019t think much of it ... we were both in our 30s and most people have had at least 1 or 2 awkward experiences by that point in their life! He then asks me if I\u2019ve ever had an awkward one-night stand or anything similar. So I was honest with him, and told him about a time over 12 years ago that I had a one-night stand with a guy who was friends with a family member. It was consensual, we were both single, it never went any further than that ... I thought it was just a silly, awkward story about something that happened a long time ago.\n\nHe immediately got weirdly jealous and acted as though I\u2019d admitted to having an ongoing torrid love affair with him. He asked for the guy\u2019s name, demanded to know if I\u2019d ever run into him after that and went on and on about how weird it must be if I ever saw him, kept asking if I still talked to him and just generally making the whole out to be a huge, meaningful deal. I told him that no, it wasn\u2019t a big deal, that I\u2019d run into the guy a time or two since then and it was maybe very slightly awkward but there were no bad feelings or anything because neither of us had expected anything more than a fun night out of it.\n\nHe then acted all disgusted, said \u201ceww, I don\u2019t want to hear about what a good time you had with him\u201d and kept telling me how weird the whole thing was. I got angry, and told him it wasn\u2019t fair for him to treat me like I\u2019m a slut over this when he\u2019d admitted a couple minutes ago to having done the same thing. He then told me I was \u201cgetting crazy for no reason\u201d and that he was tired of the \u201cdrama\u201d and gave me the silent treatment for the rest of the night. That was the first real fight we had.\n\nAnd after that, he brought that story up again and again as evidence that I was not suited to being in a relationship and do not have what it takes to love someone. All because I\u2019d made the mistake of being honest with him.\n\nDoes anyone else have stories about how your Nex tricked you into sharing something, and then continued to use it against you?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Thank you for your patience.", "author": "JoeMarch8", "self_text": "I\u2019ve never sought personal advice over Internet forums, yet here I am being compelled to do exactly that. No condescension at all though - as a recent convert to the pure brilliance that is Reddit, I\u2019m placing a lot of faith and hope (and gratitude) here. Also, I\u2019m deeply apologetic for the length of this post, although it\u2019s helped me finally purge. \n\n(Quick context before I delve into the issue at hand: I\u2019m a little over 30, have been seeking therapy on and off (had to let some therapists go), am working and studying alongside and am generally sorted in most aspects of life. As much as one can be. While I have loving friends and a concerned family, I find that I\u2019ve been unable to share much of my worries and pain with anyone to the extent I needed/wanted through the rough times I rode out over the past 2-3 years, having had to soothe myself all through it and just hold on and not spiral. This means that I have close to no one to share this long-standing relationship concern with other than having to rehash things in my head and some intervention from therapists.)\n\nOk, delving in. My ex and I met over a dating app nearly four years ago and hit it off instantly. We met a few days after and he seemed to like me instantly, seeing as how our first \u201cdate\u201d lasted over 5 hours, even if it consisted of him talking about himself and other deeply personal topics and trying to hit on me and slyly reference having a future. I dismissed this as mere banter and the effect of having plyed him with too much liquor. Anyway, in just a matter of days since we first met, I grew to like him quite a bit. He was quite unlike the men I had been meeting, and entirely unlike the Ex who had ripped my heart to bits just a year ago. He was gentle, extremely polite, concerned (at least on the face of it), goofy, had stellar taste in music and worked in the music business, classy, restrained, well dressed, and an overall cutie. However, I am always wary of letting my guards down too soon in a romantic relationship and I took my sweet time to open up. He wasn\u2019t pushy or aggressive, and we only slept together once I was completely comfortable and we had begun dating exclusively. \n\nThe first 4-5 months were a fairytale whirlwind romance replete with cute surprises, intensely memorable dates, spending every waking hour around each other being puppy-eyed, having FUCK LOADS of good, wholesome sex, meeting all his friends (and chilling with mine), AND a proposal. Yep, he proposed to me on one of our most romantic dates within just 2 months of meeting me for the very first time over an app. Did I think this was odd? Slightly. Did I say no? No. It actually felt right. It felt so right. It was almost as if it made perfect complete sense at the end of the date we had concluded that preceded the proposal. Was it a proper proposal? No. It was spur of the moment, and involved him giving me my own ring till he would buy me one. Did he buy me one? Sorta, but we will get to that in a jiffy. \n\nWhat I\u2019ve just described is either any regular honeymoon phase between any other couple (is it, though?) or what is commonly described as the lovebombing phase when dealing with a class A narcissist. \n\nI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t see through some of it. Or if not see through it, I suspected something. But it was so hard to put a finger on anything seeing as how wonderful, attentive, warm, loving etc etc he was. For all intents and purposes, he was the perfect boyfriend. But I remember I always felt it was too good to be true. Also, he always told me that ALL his exes cheated on him and left him in a cold, calculative manner. But conflicting conditioning over the years, and the over exposure to commercialised self-love culture, made me question my instinct as to whether I felt I didn\u2019t deserve such a love and was terming it too good to be true and deeming myself (and what we shared) unworthy. The dichotomy of wanting to trust your instincts while also not wanting to act out trauma patterns. Of course, two people can be soulmates and fall deeply and madly in love. Can\u2019t they? Well, I guess we\u2019ll find out. \n\nWithin days of the proposal\u2014which he convinced me repeatedly that he meant to do and meant to follow through on and that he had never felt this way about anyone before\u2014he was pressuring me to meet each other\u2019s families and set the ball rolling. Soon our conversations were permeated by near-constant talk of meeting our families and planning a spring wedding (about less than a year ahead at the time), of combining our work, of where we would live once we settled in together, of getting a dog, and peppered with loose plans of where to honeymoon (right down to which airbnb we would stay at, given the time of year we \u2018planned\u2019 to visit \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). \n\nTo be fair to my younger self, I tried to stop it. I genuinely felt pressured and felt it was way, way too soon. We met on a dating app, didn\u2019t know each other from Adam, and had barely been dating 9-12 weeks. But when I mustered the courage to have the uncomfortable conversation and let him know in no ambiguous terms that I was not ready and would not be ready for another year, I was told if I didn\u2019t see us being married soon, he would have to let go. That should have been a MASSIVE red flag, instead I was so taken in by my own growing sense of attachment and fondness for this man - I agreed to go ahead with the plan. \n\nFast forward to 2-3 months post the proposal - things were still fantastic. We never fought. We never had petty issues. We loved, laughed, ate, dated, chilled, got chubbier, and planned this promised future together. He now even insisted on buying me at least a promise ring.\n\nAnyhow, the following month we met each other\u2019s parents. And that\u2019s when shit got very real. We met my family first. Barring a few awkward moments and silences, the meeting went rather well. My mum really liked him, even if my father was a tad wary. However, meeting his family was a whole other story. What started off as a relatively normal, warm encounter at his family house (he lives with them) turned into something far more sinister and left me in tears at the end of it. Sounds dramatic, and even a few years on it is as dramatic in memory. I recall I walked in and greeted his mum and apologised for us having run an hour late (on account of me being very, very nervous and not feeling well; they were kept well informed of the delay), and she coolly retorted, \u201cThe damage is already done.\u201d Wow. Great opener for someone you\u2019re hosting who might be your to-be daughter-in-law. \n\nWhat followed was a 3-hour long semi-polite interrogation concerning my family background, my views on working after marriage and keeping a marriage stable, my career, why I liked their son (this was odd), and ended in them making it subtly clear that I was unwelcome and that I wasn\u2019t a \u201cgood fit.\u201d I felt like I had failed the most important interview of my life that I didn\u2019t know I was supposed to be taking. It took seconds within leaving his house (he dropped me back) for me to break down. I didn\u2019t know why. But I felt something was very off. I felt something really bad had happened and I couldn\u2019t quite tell what it was or how. At the risk of sounding baselessly occultist, I felt I\u2019d been cursed. Or something. It also didn\u2019t help that his mother practiced/practices some form of communication with the dead/spirit realm and had a generally unhappy, overtly sarcastic and snarky, almost mean spirited vibe. Of course, I\u2019ll never know if it\u2019s because of what he told them about me or whether this is just who she is/was or whether it was me. Either way, that\u2019s when the honeymoon officially ended. \n\nWe had our first fight within a week of this meeting when I pressed him to tell me what went down and where we stood now. After having evaded my tense moods for over five days, I pushed him into a corner and demanded answers and this is what I got: \u201cI think we should drop the marriage talk for a while.\u201d \n\nI was SHOCKED. But most of all, I flew into rage. I didn\u2019t scream or shout or throw things, I could just feel my sense of shame, lack of belonging, and pure rage rise up within me. I wanted him out. And so I calmly, if coldly and firmly, asked him to leave my house. He didn\u2019t. So I asked him again, and said I needed to be alone and that I was going to get very, very angry and that he needed to leave immediately so we could hash this out when I was feeling better. He tried to reason with him and started grovelling. I kept my resolve and could feel my cheeks getting hotter, my heart racing and my mouth beginning to form words I would come to regret deeply. But I held back, and yelled at him to getthefuckout. Instead, as he began to slowly and deliberately pack his stuff (he wasn\u2019t living with me, but he was ALWAYS over) I heard sobbing. Within seconds, he fell to the floor and began sobbing uncontrollably and seemed to be having a full blown panic attack and begged me not to leave him or let him go. I was stunned at first (felt kinda fake, ngl) and just watched him collapse into a heap, but at some point it felt real. He really seemed like he was breaking. So I comforted him like a baby, forgot about my own pain and anger, and just decided to let it go as I cradled his sobbing, trembling body in my arms. \n\nWe did drop the marriage talk for a bit. I kind of understood how conservative Indian parents can be and it didn\u2019t help that he had lost his only sibling a few years prior and was now their sole descendant (child?). His deceased sister was a recurring theme in every reason he would go on to give me for the next 9 months for why he couldn\u2019t make things work with me and convince his parents. And I still accept that as a legit possibility. \n\nA few months later we were meant to celebrate my first birthday together as a couple. Except we had another fight about the same issue a few days prior (I brought it up even though things were going just fine), and he decided to punish me (or so it seemed) by being completely uninterested and bored on the day of, the day preceding, and a bit of the day after my birthday. It really seemed like he couldn\u2019t give a damn beyond fucking me once in the morning and once at the end of the day. No gifts. Just a hug, a fuck, a lousy cake he picked off the market while we stepped out and a coffee date at one of the city\u2019s most exclusive restaurants. Cool. I\u2019ll take it. I cried that day in the loo. Something seemed so wrong yet I couldn\u2019t tell what or why or how. \n\nI kept my peace for as a long as I could and things finally seemed to get a lot better. However, around this time - his grandpa was admitted to hospital and was on his death bed. There had been a lot of tragedies in his immediate family alone in the years preceding us meeting, including his grandmother having been hospitalised around the time we had begun dating. Two months post the birthday, his grandfather passed away. I went to the funeral and had to stand outside because I wasn\u2019t sure his mother would want me there. I literally stood outside the crematorium while everyone else was inside. To be fair to him, I\u2019m the first person he rushed to greet and be with as soon as his religious formalities were over. I could tell he felt bad I couldn\u2019t/did not come in. I could tell he wished it weren\u2019t that way. I had cooled off and asked for space around this time because I figured we didn\u2019t have a future with the way things were going, but I came back when the tragedy occurred. Soon, our fights were occurring with alarming frequency and intensity. He accused me of being cold, aggressive, and \u201cfucked in the head\u201d because I was constantly kicking him out or threatening to break up. I know I was being a dick, but I wanted to get out before I got too hurt. I tend to repeat this pattern in most of my relationships. \n\nThe next few months were just an endless cycle of me pushing him to give me clarity about whether his parents would accept me or not and him being reluctant to speak with them and asking me to \u201cwalk away.\u201d And walk away, I did. At least 6-9 times in 3-4 months. Same story each time - he would push me away, I\u2019d stay the fuck away, he\u2019d come begging for me again promising to make things right and ask for some time and we would jump right back into it. \n\nThis shitty carousel lasted another 3 months until I decided enough was enough and I needed to move on. But hey, either go out with a bang or don\u2019t leave at all. So I threw him a LAVISH surprise party at a hotel penthouse suite, invited his friends and colleagues, toted crates of booze by myself after a long day at work, and blew up my entire month\u2019s pay cheque only to wake up alone in a trashed hotel room that became some sort of sad, twisted metaphor for our relationship: started off heady and glitzy, ended in party debris. He refused to spend the night and only sent me a two-word \u201cThank You\u201d before he slept off. Nothing more and nothing less. One year of our relationship in, all I got was a two-word, near formal phrase of what actually seemed like genuine gratitude. But it obviously wasn\u2019t enough and I blocked him. Everywhere. I was DONE. I also might mention that we \u201ccelebrated\u201d our first-year anniversary of dating that month by booking out a hotel room, which he left me in alone after getting mad at me for lighting a joint (admittedly, he always hated my pot habit) and I checked out and paid all by myself the next morning. \n\nHe came back within 2-3 weeks. Begging. Saying all the right things. We never really had any issues aside from the supposed lack of parental acceptance and his lack of spine, and I really did love him. It seemed he did too and that he was helpless at home. By way of being candid: I had begun to show my rage. I have been repeatedly diagnosed with impulse control disorder and struggled then to control my anger. As such, I would scream and yell during our fights, term him spineless and say nasty things about his family. I didn\u2019t mean any of it. I was usually functioning with extreme anxiety and work stress (I was also being sexually harassed at work), and my reactions to him were often regrettable. So I softened and we decided to start afresh and give this another go. He even promised to speak to his parents and make them come around. \n\nThis time, he came through. He met my mum again (who was very firm with him and made it clear that we needed to date more before we made a binding decision). He invited me home to meet and chill with his folks, and I did. And they were surprisingly warm and welcoming. I began to visit his place a few more times, and his mother really warmed up to me. He too was being a devoted, loving, mature-r boyfriend. Things finally seemed so alright. But not for long.\n\nLess than two months in, I was compelled to leave my job due to intense sexual harassment, I started preparing for formal litigation while being without a steady paycheque, and I had finally spiralled into moderate to severe clinical depression (I was diagnosed then), including some bouts of self harming, a habit I had long left behind when I was last clinically depressed as an 18-year-old. \n\nDuring this time, I was also deserted by my best friend who claimed he distanced because he didn\u2019t know how to deal with me and was entirely focused on his new relationship. In fact, he had once also attacked me for not being emotionally present for his new girlfriend and being a depressive, demanding mess who needed to stop expecting anything from people. That was the final straw. It was then that I saw my world crumble and I crashed out completely. \n\nMy boyfriend couldn\u2019t handle me by himself either and rapidly became irritable, snappy, and would stonewall me. We spent a month after in a loop of me crying and yelling on the phone for help and attention and soothing, while he would scream back in frustration at not being able to help me. Maybe he wanted to and couldn\u2019t, maybe he didn\u2019t and was just trying to shove me off. But it really did feel like he tried. In fact, I\u2019d say he tried very hard to save me but he just burnt out. Maybe he didn\u2019t care as much as he showed. Either way, I stand by the fact that at a time when I wasn\u2019t even turning to my own family, he stood by me through a lot of verbal and emotional abuse I threw at him because I was burning with rage, grief, confusion, trauma, and more on the inside and at least half of me knew that his bullshit over the past year had a lot to do with my collapsed mental health. I even said as much and held him constantly responsible while pushing him to be there for me when he felt he couldn\u2019t. \n\nI eventually got a lot better, even though my litigation began in full swing, replete with character assassination in court and outside and losing my best friend and slowly but surely losing my boyfriend (whom we all thought would be my husband/fianc\u00e9) too. \n\nWe eventually broke it off in September when my mental health had stabilised a fair bit (the outbursts and hand slitting had abated entirely/was on medication). He dumped me. He said he too had fallen into depressive symptoms and just didn\u2019t have the will or hope to carry on a relationship with me or anyone. He assured me there was no one else and he just needed some time to recalibrate and that he still hoped we had a future. Just not then. Maybe later when we were both better. He also said he had sought out therapy and that is another story. \n\nI was wise enough to not fall for that again. So I walked out. I left. I took off for a solo trip to a remote mountainous region with no connectivity and I fled. But after 10 days of near silence and purging the childhood trauma that erupted from nowhere, I came back a calmer, happier person with an overflowing well of love and gratitude for the man I believe stood by me like a rock when I needed it most. But should he not have anyway? Was that all I needed to be so besotted and impressed that I forgave the break up? \n\nTo be fair, I didn\u2019t jump back in. I merely told him I still loved him, that I wanted us to be together but I was going to move on for both our sakes. He flipped out and tried to stop me from going on dates or moving apart. He even went so far as to tell me that he would marry me someday come what may. That it was \u201cwritten in stone.\u201d I fell for it a little, but decided I would try and move on anyway, inspite of his puppy-face pleading with me not to. \n\nI\u2019m glad I did. Because not only did I meet some interesting people who went on the become warm, casual friends, I also did start to get over him. Little by tiny little. And he began to cool off a bit as well. \n\nA few months later (early to mid last year/2018) we began to hang out again (as friends with benefits) and he insisted that he still saw a future with me. But he wanted me to visit his therapist and see if we could work around couples\u2019 therapy or individual therapy to bring us back together to a healthy, loving place. He was  quite persuasive about me visiting his shrink, but I was wary. For obvious reasons. It would be a roast for me. But I gave in, and asked him to get me an appointment anyway. \n\nHere\u2019s a story that should also go down in the books for what ought to never happen in the supposed safe space of therapy. \n\nThis charming, gregarious lady (divorced with a teenaged child, extremely tall and well spoken and good looking) of 40, made it abundantly clear that she thought I was there of my own accord and in order to get my ex back. The moment I walked in I remembered having this odd thought that either she had a soft corner for my Ex, or that she was somehow biased against me. This was confirmed when she ended the therapy by telling me that this was not going to be a route to getting him back (which is odd, because he pushed me to her) and that she was relieved to see I wasn\u2019t a narcissist. What?! Even if that were the case, till this day I\u2019m befuddled as to how she made that assessment within an hour of meeting me for the first time. \n\nTherapy, it soon became clear to me, was not a safe place, even though I was visiting her as a separate patient. I often raised the subject with her, and even went as far as to suggest that she had a perceptible bias towards my ex. I would have to censor what I felt about my ex, or she would often avoid his topic completely. Sometimes, she would even cross reference what we said about each other and the relationship with either of us in our respective therapy sessions. I thought this was quite odd. She termed the proposal as a figment of my over active \u201cgirly\u201d imagination, and that I misread the situation. She even repeatedly dismissed my concerns about what I felt I had been through, while downplaying my ex\u2019s role. She would tell me she thought he was a harmless, sweet,  non-clever, simple young man who was clearly besotted with me too but was troubled and wary by the darkness he had seen during my depression. That he just needed time and that I needed to lay off him and work on my own happiness and myself, and that if it was meant to be we would find our way to each other. \n\nI\u2019d be lying if I said some part of her therapy didn\u2019t help, especially in how I began to respond to my ex and whatever fragments of a relationship we were still clinging to. \n\nTo cut a relevant digression short: exactly a year ago, she threw me (yes, threw) me out of therapy because I politely, but firmly, confronted her about her bias for my ex, and that I was the emotionally abusive narcissistic monster in the relationship who was, and I quote her here, \u201chell bent on feeling wretched and hurting those whose loved me.\u201d \n\nAnd this is where our long, sordid story ended. I cut him off. He cut me off. And we both knew this was over. \n\nOf course, since then he tried come back many times for a shag, or a date, or emotional comfort. I tried moving on and even dated someone on a rebound for a few months. The ex was aware of this throughout, and decided to cut me off because he couldn\u2019t \u201cbear to see me move on.\u201d All fair. \n\nAfter I dumped the rebound, the ex and I reconnected and he got back to his mushy ways to get me to grab a meal, or attend a gig, or watch a film all while hoping it would end in sex. And it did. It always did. I\u2019m not sure why I kept believing that he was just scared and needed time and this was his way of showing love and holding on. To be fair, he hasn\u2019t dated anyone after me. He also claims that I\u2019m the only person he has slept with since the day we began dating. As of this morning, he still stands firmly by that assertion. I can\u2019t be too sure about the latter. \n\nTwo-three months ago, I finally decided I wanted to get off this now-rusted carousel, and I told him something I knew would make him get off me forever. On a particularly cleansing acid trip (alone, in my house), I confessed to him that I\u2019d slept with the ex prior to him within the first 5-6 weeks of us dating. I told him it didn\u2019t mean anything, that we barely knew each other then (although we were very much dating exclusively) and that I was very very sorry. He was shocked, and he didn\u2019t say much. I don\u2019t blame him. He said it was odd to hear this over three years later when we were far from being a couple, that it hurt him nevertheless, but he reiterated that it did nothing to affect the massive \u201csoftest corner\u201d he had for me and always would. \n\nI thought things would end there for good, but within a few weeks he texted again and asked to hang out. We did. We fucked again. He went sort of cold again, but this time I was prepared. And by now I had begun going on dates with someone new. I told him this and told him I wanted him to never contact me ever again. But we ended it sweetly. Exactly a week in, he texted me saying he too had met someone else (first time in the time we were together in any capacity), and that he wanted to pursue it to see how it goes. This was mid-April this year. \n\nI\u2019m posting this today because we fucked last night. We completely cut off in April, and were in complete NC (I asked for it, he always wants and pleads to be friends/in touch) for 50+ days until he swiped right on me on Bumble yesterday morning. I had swiped left on him twice, and when his card showed up the third time, I knew he had swiped right on me. Out of pure ego-stroking curiosity on both our ends - we matched. Many hours later, I sent him a text acknowledging that we only did it for the ego stroke, and he didn\u2019t seem pleased with that opener at all. We had a brief conversation where he seemed either cold or awkward or both. Don\u2019t ask how (I was horny and I miss him) - but I invited him home and well, here I am. \n\nMy only questions in all of this are: \n- Was I involved with a narcissist? Some of this seems entirely from the well studied  Lovebombing\u2014Devaluation\u2014Discard cycle?\n- Have I been/am I being used/abused? Because I always power through without checking in with my feelings and force myself to be \u201cchill\u201d\n- Am I the narcissist here? Was the therapist right about me being the problem? My friends love him (and are still in touch with him), while his friends and family are either indifferent or don\u2019t like me.\n- Is there any chance in hell that I have misread the situation and that his constant back-and-forth is significant in any way or reflective of him wanting me? (I kinda already know the answer to this one, but I\u2019ll throw it out anyway.) \n\nI do miss him. I\u2019m not sure why. Perhaps because on most occasions, save a few, he treated me very, very well. Or maybe this is all misplaced grief. But his presence (and any time spent together) still makes me happy. Unless this is what Stockholm syndrome plays out like. \n\nI understand that this is a very lengthy post, and I\u2019d be grateful for just about anyone who had the patience to go through it. I\u2019d love to put a TL;DR here shortly. For now - thank you for giving me the space to say this to someone after so long and try and make sense of it. :)", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Among various other sexual assaults etc, I was gang raped when i was 17. I\u2019m 21 now and a lot has changed. \nMy first outburst of any kind of reaction to the most major assault wasn\u2019t until I was 18, when I walked out of an exam because I felt trapped, like I had done during the assault. \nThen I broke up with my boyfriend (after three years we\u2019re back together and happier than ever), moved out of town, developed an eating disorder, substance abuse problems, self harm issues etc. I fell in with a troubled crowd of people. I was being beaten by one of my housemates on the daily and eventually moved back home with my mum. I was unstable. Unwell. Me, the perfect, straight-A student who had wanted to do medicine in university at one point, was taking meth in the toilets by myself during class at community college (which I hated, by the way lol). \nOne day I had just had enough after a friend took too many drugs and held me against the wall with a knife. \nIt took me a few tries to get clean, but I eventually did it. I was clean for two years on May 12th. I ended up going to uni for a while and did psychology for a year and a half. I wanted to impress people. Saw a counsellor while I was there. She saved my life. I was doing a lot better at this point but some of my friends were .. a bit bitchy and to be honest just plain old high maintenance. They judged me because I had slept around when I was younger. I had no confidence and I just wanted them to like me so I started to change myself even more for the people around me. I didn\u2019t want to feel alone ever again. But I did. I started to feel that my thoughts weren\u2019t my own.. my thoughts were confused and saturated with suicidal ideation. All I had ever wanted to do was art and now I was doing psychology in a place I hated, surrounded by people I was only using to fill my time so I didn\u2019t feel alone? \n\nI told my counsellor about this feeling, the belief that there were two people in my head and one of them wanted me to die. She took me to hospital and I was assessed. My mum came to take me home. I talked. I talked to her, my granny, my counsellor, my friends back home, my doctor, the psychiatrists, the psychologists. I started to take medication around February time. I left uni and came home. I worked part time. I got a full time job after that. I stopped having panic attacks. I stopped drinking. I started eating. I even do some of all the yoga bullshit sometimes. I take medication. I go outside every day. \nI lost my job last week. So as it stands, I\u2019m unemployed, but I\u2019m ok. I\u2019m stable. There\u2019s only one train of thought in my head and I can sit beside a guy I don\u2019t know on the train and not freak out. I make mistakes and don\u2019t starve or cut myself.

I wondered at the time, 'Do they think I'm lame or something?' \n\nOr a conversation we had where they criticized something a friend of mine did (that was admittedly pretty cringeworthy). I had asked them, \"Do you ask that often of yourself? 'Am I being too harsh?' \"\n\n\"No. Most of the time I'm harsher than this.\"\n\nOr our first argument (of many) early into our friendship where they reacted negatively to me asking if they had trouble talking about emotional topics. \"I'm just fine with emotional stuff, idk how not being able to adequately respond to messages by someone I barely know about whatever random thought passes through their head has to do with it.\" \"You don't know me, you don't get to say that shit about me.\" \"Good lord, where do you get off on passing that kind of judgment on people?\" I apologized for violating boundaries at the end of the conversation. They never responded. \n\nHow they would criticize me for venting too much (something I agreed with them on and later tried to fix) and tell me I couldn't demand \"emotional labor\" from him, but when I would try to ask about them to even things out they would say something like, \"Idk why I'm expected to spill my guts to you.\" \n\nOr the time when they were bragging in a discord server we were in together about having \"big dick energy\" (pretty silly, I know). I tried to light-heartedly roast them. They then lashed out at me in front of everyone. \"All you do is detract and undermine everything I say.\" \"You rely on me saying stuff so you can undermine me.\" \"Your energy is tiny.\" I felt bullied, but I played it off like it was nothing and shrugged it off. \n\nThen there was one of our last arguments. I told them they were right about what they were saying, but also said I found their words painful. Despondently, I asked them if they cared about me at all. \"I'm only being as harsh as I have to be.\" \"Of course I care.\" \"Trust me, if I didn't care I would have expressed myself differently.\"\n\nOr some of their words in their last message to me. \"You only care about people if you can gain or benefit from them.\"\n\nI have such a mix of emotions about it now that it's over.

While he enjoys hanging out watching the oldest do crafts, I am running around like a headless chicken trying to stop the lo from taking items from other kids, getting in the way or simply doing everything in the world that would harm her or piss someone else off. He takes over for 15 mins while I take my eldest to the bathroom and to play with the sand box. Just as we make it there I get a frantic text from him that the lo is just too hard to handle and we have to swap back. Typical. Again, I got no time to enjoy activities with my eldest.\n\nJust as we were about to leave, my youngest throws the tantrum of her life, complete with flailing, kicking, punching, screaming and laying on the floor. Basically she is over stimulated and over tired. He just takes the endest and walks outside the front door, leaving me to deal with her, as usual. I managed to get her outside where she squirm so bad and swings both her arms, hitting me repeatedly in the face, that I have to put her down. She crawls right by the door (about five foot away) and swings, flails, kicks, everything so I can't pick her up. Like physically I can't get close to her to pick her up. Then, just as I go to grab her, she throws herself backwards and hits her head. He is just standing by watching, by they way. No attempt to hel, just watching it all go down. Just as she does this, a woman and her 6 yo open the door. Thinking they bumped me as I was picking her up and she went back, the woman says \"WE didn't hit you or her did we?\" I said no, she is having a tantrum and thew back. The lady gave me the look every mom of a child 3+ gives another mom who's kid is playing up, the \"I have been there too. I know what it is like\" look.\n\nWe finally got the lo to the car and she throws another fit about getting in her seat, so we sit in the parking lot with her on my lap, trying to snuggle her as she whacks me over and over in the face. I had to put my hands up to protect myself to my face, hunched my arms in and cover my face up. Then he starts with this\n\n\"Oh so now you want everyone to think your kids are abusing you too. You want to play the poor hard done by mom. You are doing this for sympathy\"\n\nThen he says \"that woman asked if YOU were hitting the kid  she obviously sees how abusive you are. She looked at you with disgust. I bet she will call the cops on you. You look so trashy. You are a horrible mom. You are fucking crazy and everyone can see how crazy you are. You are a fucking evil bitch\".\n\nI called out his gaslighting lie. I told him verbatim what the woman said. There was staff outside who witnessed the whole thing too. Then he started with the \n\n\"Oh, so you want to make this all about you and accusing ME of gaslighting YOU? And you don't see this is YOU being abusive to me and the kids. You don't give a fuck the kid (he always refers to her as the kid) bashed her head open (it was a fricken tap, no bump, nothing), you just want to sit here and play victim again\".\n\nThe I see why he is saying it. People have just pulled up next to us and are trying to get out. Of course he is being super loud and the lo is still swinging at me. \n\nThen he starts shouting what a horrible abuser I am, how I neglect my kids (I am their personal slave 24/7 360 who gets in trouble for taking a five minute shit because that is too long and I am selfish).\n\nI feel like he really just set up the situation to abuse me by not helping on the first place, knowing she was in meltdown and knowing how she is in meltdown.\n\nIt isn't the first time either. Whenever we go shopping and he has her in the cart while me and the eldest go get something on the next aisle, he will take the lo out to walk about, rather than get her involved in the experience and happy like I do, then she throws a fit when I have to try and get her back in\n This results in me either having to chase her everywhere or trying to hold her as she struggles to get free and I can't get anything done. If she stuggles then he accuses me of trying to get sympathy from other because I pretend I can't hold her (she is the size of a 4 yo and strong as hell), or starts a fight because we can't get the shopping done.\n\nEating out too. I hurt my back on mother's day and we had to go with his family to dinner. After 3 hours of sitting at a table while his mom got drunk, my lo had enough\n I had to limp around the place keeping her calm (they ALL knee my back was out) and he just sat there with my calm 5 yo.\n\nIt is like every fucking excuse he will set me up to look bad, like a bad mom (or at least make me feel like it), and for him to abuse me the second we get in the car. I posted a couple of weeks back about how he pulled a mega rage in the car after a grocery store trip.\n\nSo thought, was this another set up or am I just being over sensitive? \n\nWhen you see obvious patterns it feels like a total set up.\n\nBtw, I am at the point of not wanting to go anywhere ever again.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This is my story.", "author": "pepesilvia2792", "self_text": "I'm at the end of my rope. I just want to share my story. I Don't know if it will help, but I want to tell my side for once. \n\nLast January I was forced to resign from my job after my boss sexually assault me, and demanded sex in exchange for my job. He did a lot of other things too, like masturbate in front of me and threaten my safety. My boss was one of the top executives in a massive legal partnership, and everyone was afraid of him. The abuse got more and more intense after I walked in on my boss snorting crushed pills off his desk one morning. He flipped out and, used high ranking legal position to threaten me into silence. Then he tried to go after me in the men's room, and I hid in a stall while he tried to get in by force. I was afraid for my safety, my job, and my career, but eventually I knew I had to do something.\n\nWhen I tried to speak out, almost everyone accused me of either asking for it, making the whole thing up, or being crazy; no one believed me. HR wouldn't help me because these sorts of things \"didn't happen to men.\" Everyone ignored the problem.\n\nA few days before Christmas, I went to throw myself of a bridge at during my lunch break, but couldn't bring myself to do it. When I came back to the office, my boss walked up to my desk, kicked it, leaned down close, and grunted at me. I was so afraid, but I knew what would happen if I didn't leave. I when to HR and resigned. \n\nThe director of HR launched a fake investigation to help covered it all up, and then blacklisted me by privately sending a blacklisting memo to all the company's partners saying that I was a \"problem candidate\" and not to hire me. I was threatened into silence, and afraid I would be sued for slander/libel if I spoke out. The company even called and threatened my unemployment caseworker to try and prevent me from collecting unemployment (props to my caseworker for not backing down though!)  \n\nDespite being an expert in my area, I can't get a job to save my life now. I have not been able to get full time work in my industry since. This incident has become a black stain on my life, my career, my social life, my romantic life, and my mental health. I can barely making ends meet now. I'm personally broken, suffer from ptsd, and can't hold a relationship because of my problems. It haunts me everyday, and I can even talk about it without ridicule and stigma over being assaulted as a man. \n\nTo be clear, I'm NOT saying that sexual assault isn't a huge issue for women too, defiantly more so overall, but as a man it's different. I get made fun of by other men, and have had a group of guys even slap me in the ass and yell \"go tell HR!\" at me. I'm tired of being called a \"fag\", \"pussy\", \"weakling\", \"freak\", etc...  People have said that if I was so weak as to let this happen, I deserved it. My own mother doesn't even believe me. I'm tired of being told that this makes me not a man. \n\nI tired therapy several times, but it was useless and expensive. Talking about what happened with a stranger I pay didn't help. Fuck, I'm going to snap if one more person tells me to be mindful, practice breathing, get a good diet and exercise.\n\nThese days I don't talk to people anymore. I'm alone almost all the time. I can't date anymore. I don't want to see my old friends because they all just see me as \"crazy\", and keep saying I'm gay (no issue with gay people, but I'm straight being assaulted didn't change that!) I'm exhausted from having this turned into joke. I drink and cry in my apartment when I'm not working at the part-time job I hate. My bills and loans are piling up. I'm too broken to even care anymore; I'm just waiting to die. I'm angry, sad, exhausted and, ashamed. I don't want to go on anymore. \n\nI've had people tell me that #metoo isn't for me, because I am a man, and men are the aggressors and the problem.  Fuck that.

Adam was around the same age as my brother so he was about 7-8. He started to take a liking to me and would pull me under a bed, cover it up with pillows and undress me, he said it was a game i forget what he called it. I was only 5 so i believed him. \n\nI thought this was normal at this point, because he would try to do it when in the middle of playing a game with us and my brother. He would just make sure that my brother or parents weren't around. Like he knew what he was doing was wrong. I still remember it clear as day to this day, I am 23 now. \n\nThe more I think about it the more i wonder if this was going on in his home and so thats why he thought this was ok? I also downplay the abuse because he was a young kid too. I assume he didn't know any better but the way he'd sneak around with it and take precautions like he did felt like he knew what he was doing. \n\nThis ruined my insight on what was normal and what wasn't in relationships. I thought that because I had originally consented to sex with an ex I had to go through with it even though i didn't want to. So when i asked him to stop and he didn't I had to just lay there and take it anyway. I was easily coerced into sex by men. I'm not proud of it, I'm actually very disgusted in myself for letting it happen. \n\nI blame myself for all of this happening because i never told my parents and they still don't know to this day.

It was like I didn't know what hit me. And the devastation and longing after he left... Now I'm learning that it was a classic Narcissistic move, the obsessive love bombing that is like opiate for the brain, and the subtle but pervasive devaluation that always kept me on my toe, the dichotomy of him telling me that I was the embodiment of everything he ever dreamt of and at the same time, tiny criticisms that would keep me on guard. And oh boy, did he lie, pathological or not, even the most audacious lies, I let pass because I wanted to hold on to the fantasy. His obsession with physical beauty was pervasive but it made me feel good that I was beautiful to him. As I read up more on Narcissism, I wonder if they are ever aware of what they are doing... it can not be so maliciously intentional because I think they do believe that they are in \"love\" (or lust) with you at the moment. You ARE all they can think about. I don't think that can be manufactured as a pretense. And that is why it is so hard when they leave, so coldly one day. They have another supply that they are obsessed with and its only months later that you realize, this new supply must have been in the wings or he couldn't have jumped ship so fast. All those times he expressed his doubt of my fidelity, he was just projecting. And now, reading about all these Cluster B personality types, I realize that I embody a lot of the traits. Different from Narcissists but definitely we share the same traits, attaching at an obsessive speed, idealization, deep rooted fear of abandonment (could fit BPD, histrionics) and hence, no matter how logically I understand what happened, I can't get over it in a normal healthy way. I am idealizing what we had, my thoughts immediately revert back to the euphoria I experienced with him and is in a never ending loop like a broken machine and the thought of him with his new supply drives me insane with humiliation and jealousy.

I was in a shell-shocked stupor. I simply could not understand how my wife had seemingly changed into a completely different person almost overnight. We had been together for 18 years \u2013 happily, or so I thought \u2013 but my world had been ripped apart when I discovered that she had been having multiple affairs for an indeterminate number of years.\n\nI was in terrible pain, having discovered that she was apparently in love with a 31-year old Italian stud. My wife, I learned to my abject horror and distress, had been having a \u2018relationship\u2019 with him for at least two years while still having physical relations with me, admittedly sporadically compared to the early years of our partnership. This, however, didn\u2019t stop her from regularly telling me I was the \u2018love of her life\u2019. \n\nNow that I am better educated about narcissism I look at this email in an entirely different light than on the day I left her. I pick up on lots of standard narcissist catchphrases. Hoovering, manipulation, blame-shifting, etc. I think one could almost place this email in the Narcissism Hall Of Fame.\n\nAs always, however, I fluctuate in my opinions. I will never be completely sure that I am right. Is she really a narcissist or am I conveniently rearranging the facts in order to suit my desired outcome? Motivational reasoning, is what I believe they call it. \n\nSeven months after leaving her we are now almost completely NC. This situation was achieved after enduring incredibly hurtful and cynical treatment at her hands. I could and am writing a book about what has happened to me.\n\nOnly last week, for example, she physically attacked a close female friend of mine at a concert, claiming that my friend had said something that had upset our daughter. A callous attempt to turn mutual friends against her. The problem is that several people were there to witness the mask slip and were shocked by what they saw. It was a lie of course, as my daughter and friend met up this Friday and had a lovely time with no hint whatsoever of any ill feeling from my daughter. \n\nI\u2019m posting this up here because I\u2019d love to hear anybody\u2019s opinion and/or interpretation of this little missive.

After a long pause she says to me:\n\n\"Don't you think you're selfish?\"\n\nThose words basically sent me crying and now I've locked my self in the basement, contemplating my life. I want to confront her about how I feel. I'm not sure if I should do it now or right before leaving university, but I want to do it. I'm not sure how to go about telling her about all the things I've thought of, of all the times I've cried, beat my self up over something I've done, or wanted to commit suicide. \n\nDo you guys have advice for how to confront an emotionally abusive parent? Should I do it now or later (since I'm finishing highschool this week and will be stuck at home for months)?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I\u2019m so angry.", "author": "oculus_caesius", "self_text": "Apologies for the wall of text, I\u2019m on mobile. \n\nSo on Mother\u2019s Day 2018 I told my then n-husband I wanted a divorce. Our marriage was short, but we had dated and cohabitated for three years. He was a covert narcissist. We had a 16 year age gap (which should have been my first clue), but I was blind to that at the time. He used the classic tactics of love-bombing, followed by word salad ramblings\u2014trying to act like he was much more \u201cdeep\u201d and \u201cintelligent\u201d than me or anyone else, subtle digs at my self-esteem when we were with friends, bouts of drunken yelling and stomping through our house\u2014occasionally cornering me and belittling be for claiming to feel physically threatened, and deep depressions he refused to seek treatment for where he would leach sympathy from anyone who would listen and completely neglect the most basic tasks (hygiene, paying bills, keeping a job, etc.) constantly landing us in financial peril. \n\nOur separation was brutal. He instantly began running a smear campaign on me. Many people I considered friends took the bait and listened to his sad story and doubted my claims of emotional abuse. He harassed me by continually calling and texting me. He would follow me in public places. He made my life hell for a few more months leading up to our court date. The divorce was granted without issue. He then blocked me in every mode of communication possible (I had to try and contact him about a car title issue in our divorce decree, and discovered he blocked me). Eventually the car title ordeal was sorted out, but only through letters from my attorney. \n\nA few months ago, I found out he moved three hours away and felt like I could breathe a sigh of relief. \n\nI have been in therapy since I left him. Just recently have I been opening up to my therapist about my traumas; the relationship I had with N-ex being quite significant. We\u2019ve been scratching the surface in therapy and processing things at a pace I am comfortable with. \n\nHowever, I\u2019ve started having nightmares about n-ex. Nightmares that he\u2019s still here, making my life hell. Or still stalking and harassing me. Or that I am being forced to marry him again. Every time I wake up I am so angry that he\u2019s still stealing my peace. I don\u2019t worry about it when I\u2019m awake, and I am so pissed that the memories of him are bothering me in my sleep. I\u2019ve tried everything I can, I have rid this house of all the possessions he left behind, I journal my thoughts before bed every night, I take a sleep aid, I occasionally even say an affirmation before bed out loud such as \u201cthis is my house. I am safe here. N-ex does not live here anymore. He never will again. He cannot hurt me any more.\u201d Anything I can do to solidify that concept in my brain before going to sleep. \n\nHas anyone else dealt with similar issues? Did they ever resolve? Did you learn any tips in therapy/on your own about managing the nightmares? I just want him gone from my life as much as possible.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Post is a bit long.", "author": "CharmingWonder", "self_text": "I'm hoping for some insight on my situation. I'm not sure whether I was in a relationship with a narcissist or if I was the problem (or we were both the problem?). The post is long but I'd really appreciate your opinions.\n\nAround 8 months ago I went through a breakup that left me completely destroyed. It left me incredibly hurt, angry, and confused, and back then, even suicidal. I've improved a lot, but I've still been trying to make sense of everything that happened. I ended up going to see a psychiatrist who actually brought up the possibility that my ex was a covert narcissist.\n\nBasically.. My ex broke up with me when I moved to go to school. It was only going to be for a short time and then we were going to move back in together, but he started getting very distant as soon as I left. A month later, he broke up with me, saying that he had been planning it for months and just never told me. We were together for 4.5 years.\n\nThe breakup feels like a discard. He seemed like a caring guy, but after the breakup pretty much showed no emotions at all. He actually told me he didn't feel anything. We tried to stay \"friends\" after the breakup, and his personality was all over the place. He would act sweet and kind - like someone I recognised, and then completely disappear and not answer any of my calls or texts for days/a week. He even blocked my number a few times, seemingly out of the blue. I tried to get answers about the breakup from him from the very start, and he immediately said it was \"the past\" and that he owed me nothing (we were together for 4.5 years btw). During this time I was going through a lot of emotional distress and would occasionally get upset while on the phone with him. He continued his hot/cold behaviour, and I got desperate for explanations or really just anything at all. This is where he started to insult/blame me - and he'd do it either casually like \"I forgot I actually like talking to you\" or outwardly \"You fucked me up by not having enough sex with me.\" After the breakup he also pressured me to have sex with him, and when I was out of town, he pressured me to send him pictures/get on video chat. I told him that him asking was upsetting me/messing me up, and he continued doing it. At one point I told him I wanted to go no contact, and he said it was stupid and that \"no contact wasn't a thing.\" So things continued and the whole \"breakup process\" lasted about 3 months. Then, he had one last conversation with me one night. He was really charming.. and then he told me that I actually never knew him at all. He didn't care to be friends (and saw no point in it) because I didn't really know him anyway. He said during our relationship, he was basically controlling/manipulating me. He made it seem like he had to do it, accusing me of being a person who gets mad easily and holds grudges (I don't). He even said he had a girlfriend, but didn't tell me earlier because he was afraid I'd \"attack her.\" Funny enough, he also added that he felt like I was always manipulating him. I was really confused by this and he said he'd be willing to meet and talk, but the next day when I asked if he was still up for it (I was back in town), he sent me a message telling me to never contact him ever again.\n\nThe things that stood out to me the most were things that happened during our breakup. The thing is, I feel really guilty about a lot of my actions and I'm not sure whether his were justified. When I spoke to him on the phone, I'd get upset and cry and even beg for him to give me an explanation/closure. I lashed out at him for being hot/cold. He later on told me that he had a USB stick full of proof (that I was crazy?) in case he ever needed it. He accused me of threatening to kill him, although I know 100% that I never did this and wouldn't say that to anyone. After he told me not to contact him ever again though, I drove to his house demanding an explanation and broke his glasses after he just sat in my car with no emotions and nothing to say.\n\n**Side note**: I did feel really guilty about the glasses thing and tried to apologise later for it. To be clear I've also never had any other incidents like that and am not an explosive/aggressive person.\n\nIn addition to the breakup, it seems like I might've experienced love-bombing at the beginning of our relationship. It seemed like I had met the perfect person - he was charming and had similar interests to me (and opinions). We spent all of our time together very quickly after starting the relationship. He'd sleepover at my house almost every night. We were in high school at the time and kiss between every break. We'd text when we weren't together. He did romantic things for me - put together romantic dinners, write cute notes for me, and asked me to prom by spelling it out in his backyard with lights (he pulled me onto the roof to see it). We waited a decent amount of time to have sex (since we were both virgins), but it got physical very fast when we were making out. He would start touching me/putting his hands down my pants. I'm not sure if he could tell I was uncomfortable with it, but he'd quickly stop what he was doing and quickly start expressing regret about it and say he was such a bad person for doing it. I actually always ended up comforting him for doing things I was uncomfortable with. Looking back, I'm not sure if his actions were normal or a way to manipulate me.\n\nAnd on the manipulation front.. A year after we were together he cheated on me with my friend. He told me that he didn't remember doing it because he was blackout drunk, but it was definitely his fault and he felt so awful, didn't deserve me, etc. I ended up going over to his house and basically asking him to get back together with me because I thought he was such a good person. But maybe it wasn't a manipulation and he was just really mature?\n\nAlso.. A little after this he had \"sex\" with me while I was incredibly drunk. I blacked out for most of the night but have one short memory of it happening. I couldn't really move and I didn't really get what was going on, but he was moving me around. The next day I talked to him and said that I wasn't going to report it, but that would be considered rape. He didn't take any responsibility and said that he had been drinking too so it wasn't his fault (although I literally couldn't participate at all and he had to do all of the work....). I mention this because I feel like he had a habit of crossing boundaries when it came to sex.\n\nAll of the things I've mentioned make me feel like he was a narcissist. The thing is, I don't feel like there were a lot of signs during the relationship. Other than the incidents I mentioned (that happened in the first year or so), things were ...boring. He was always \"too busy\" to go out and do things with me (he'd be doing work at home) and he never shared much about himself or his feelings. He insisted on doing everything for me (like chores and whatnot) and we never fought. He was really clingy (physically) and our sex life was admittedly not great. I'm really not sure why it wasn't great - whether I felt unsafe, emotionally disconnected from him, etc. I still wonder if there was something wrong with me. Still, he always complimented me, said that he was happy with the relationship, and generally had no complaints. We spent almost all of our time together. It was honestly an unhealthy relationship, but near the end of it I expressed my concerns and said I thought we should work on being more independent.. obviously that never really happened.\n\n**Just want to add -** I might seem like I was really stupid for forgiving some of the things that he did. But I really did love him and thought he was \"the one.\"\n\nBut yeah, guess I wonder whether he was a narcissist or whether I was just really messed up. Or both. Also, I do have an appointment with a therapist.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to mention we were both 17 at the beginning of this relationship. I'm 22 now.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I wanted what she was giving me the same way someone wants the next shot of heroin.  I had to have her no matter what till my world came crashing down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWalking in on her in bed with her boss is what finally started the beginning of the end of our toxic relationship.  I ended up in jail 3 days for assaulting the guy.  Lost my job due to no call no show during those 3 days of missed work.  Got evicted for causing a disturbance and having the apartment trashed during the fight.  Got served with restraining orders from both the guy and my ex.  But she explained it all away.  She told me he propositioned for sex in exchange for more hours and any shift she wanted.  That we needed the money and it was just a blow job.  I bought the story.  This is the 3rd guy that I caught her with and she's made it all make since.  She moved back in even with a restraining order against me.  I bought her an engagement ring and proposed.  It made since back then because she was willing to sacrifice herself for us, how could I not make her mine till death do us part.  This is the same woman that a few months before helped to nurse me back to health everyday for a month while I was recovering in an ICU.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen it happens again.  I catch her with her boss.  She doesn't have to even give an excuse.  I'm a full time college student, working 2 part time jobs, I figure I'll focus on graduating and she comes and goes.  Then one day I discover messages she'd been deleting from my old tape answering machine.  I play them for her.  25 to 30 minutes of messages she thought she had deleted that were all from her boss.  He was calling begging and pleading for her to come home.  This dude was crying and whimpering.  I had enough and she gave me back my engagement ring, then reaches in her pocket and puts on the engagement ring her boss gave her.  One day I just moved to a new apartment and changed my phone number.  I told no one where I moved.  Back then there was no internet, cell phones or email so that was it and I never looked back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6 months later I met someone new.  I graduated college, got married and my wife was expecting a baby.  Life is good.  We have been together 23 years.  Our kids have graduated college and we are looking forward to early retirement.  Then I get an email a few months ago with a few photos of a young woman.  It takes about a minute for me to realize this child has got to be mine.  I have a friend tell my ex to call me and she does.  We talk for about 2 hours and the conversation is great.  When I mention I've received pictures of her daughter she tells me I have no right to look at her photos.  She tells me to delete them and stop stalking her and her kid.  The words that hit me like a brick are when she tells me she can't do this to her ex-husband / her boss that she ended up marrying.  She hangs up and blocks my number.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince then I mailed the young woman a letter introducing myself.  I explain who I was to her mother and who I maybe to her.  I have also learned she has the same non-life threatening genetic disorder I have.  Both of my children by my wife have the same disorder.  Neither my ex or her now ex-husband have it.  This should not be a big deal.  Instead of me having the chance to meet my daughter my ex tells this young woman I was a crazy abusive ex-bf who use to beat her.  She tells the police the same thing and they call me down to the police station to answer a few questions about an investigation they are conducting.  My ex's daughter has scrubbed her online social media presence.  Why sacrifice your child's peace of mind to continue covering up the fact that you let another man raise my child.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to my race I believe my ex's now ex-husband most likely already knows he is not her biological father.  I understand he's on her birth certificate an he raised her from birth so he is her dad.  He also knew my ex was involved with me when he started his relationship with her.  I just want to know my daughter, but it seems like it will never happen.  My lawyers advised me not to attempt reaching out again.

This discard was humiliating as he reeled me in with lies to have sex only to turn around and discard me the next morning by telling me he was actually with the other woman and moving back in with her.  I took this event to immediately go NC and work on myself - I assumed I would never hear from him again.  (I even bet a friend I wouldn\u2019t and now have to fork over for a very expensive golf game)!  Friday I noticed a filtered message in messenger - it was sent in March and for some reason I didn\u2019t see it.  But now that account has me blocked.  That alone sent me for a loop - and then the very next day I was shopping and went into the self check line only to find myself face to face with him - he was at a till with her and he was looking at me with a petrified deer in the headlights look.  I was shocked but had enough sense to pretend to be the bigger detached person - I looked at him and kept walking - and did not look back when I finished before them.  I know it looked like I ignored his first message and the encounter yesterday looked like I was indifferent (rather than cause a scene and blow up his perfect life which was tempting).

Why is the universe testing me with 2 encounters in 24 hours when it has been 7 months and I felt ok?  I\u2019m worried now that I\u2019m not and need a lot more work to feel strong.  I\u2019m also worried with his encounter I\u2019ll hear from him again.  I had him blocked and his message was from a new account... Any advice for those that have had bumps in the road to stay strong and try to see reality rather than fake memories?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

In short:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- You never knew your ex, whatever lies they used in the beginning were the foundation for everything that they said and did after you fell for them. They had to remember every little detail of every single lie, they had to act in a certain way so there was no dissonance, basically the narcissist was forced to follow a plan in order to avoid revealing their callous and conning personality.\n\n\\- When you met the narcissist they lied to you, whatever they said it was all false. They're pathological liars and just can't help themselves, they made up stories and appeared as a person they can't never be. Also, they cannot fathom the idea of being alone so they were idealizing you while someone else was being devalued and discarded. The narcissist uses a lot of people at the same time for different purposes, they overlap relationships, they're just experts at hiding this fact.\n\n\\- They don't usually ask personal questions about you, they're rather shallow and act accordingly expecting that you won't dig too much into their reality. If you ask them about past relationships they will lie about the names and the events, if they can hide details they will do it just in case they need to come back to these old supplies or interact with them while they're in a \"relationship\" with you. They will usually play the victim so you let them do as they please... you don't want to be another crazy, controlling ex.\n\n\\- They will usually hide you from their friends and family, most of them don't have long-term friends since they're too busy dealing with the trail of destruction they're leaving behind.\n\n\\- If the narcissist has to tell you about their past, they will lie, if you're having a conversation about the future... they will future-fake everything. They're constantly lying, no matter what. At the end of the day, you never knew who this person really was, there's so much confusion in your brain that the body reacts with anxiety, panic, agoraphobia and depression.

{"post_id": "c1b8wc", "created_utc": 1560699637, "title": "Is he really a narcissist? Emotionally unavailable? Trying to make sense of what happened. Should I go no contact or accept his friendship?", "author": "fra4675", "self_text": "I (25F) just came out of a very roller coaster-y, painful \u201crelationship\u201d (if we can call it that) with 25M and I am looking back on things, trying to understand if he really has narcissistic traits or if I\u2019m just finding ways to cope with the brutal rejection and the breakup. Also I'm sharing my story with whoever might find it useful.\n\nA brief summary of our on-and-off story:\n\n* We met in school a few months ago, we liked each other from the start. We start dating early after respective breakups (I ended my relationship, he was left). He takes the lead and pursues me, starts and carries the whole thing on.\n* Literal heaven for the first two weeks, great chemistry, we move fast and date intensely. Thought I'd found my dream guy.\n* Then he stops and says we're rushing things, he's still too burned from his recent breakup and needs time but he really likes me; asks for a BREAK.\n* During the break we date \"platonically\". He keeps pursuing me and asking me out and flirting and doing cute things, he makes it clear that he doesn't want to let me go and he just needs time.\n* 1 month later he finally asks me to get back together. Heaven again, big talks and promises, met his mom, all good for 2 weeks.\n* Then he stops asking me out, avoids me, he is also very distant physically but keeps calling me for hours on the phone every day. He\u2019s not even interested in sex anymore.\n* Weeks later we transition to friends and never talk about it. He keeps calling me as much as before, spends hours talking to me and sends mixed signals so I\u2019m thinking he needs time again and I wait in confusion.\n* After two months in a limbo I ask, turns out he cares for me as a friend and enjoys talking to me a lot but he found he wasn\u2019t feeling \u201cthat way about us\u201d (me), also his ex had showed up again once while we were dating; nothing happened but he knew he was not over her, she made him feel things that I never could.\n* **He also admitted he wanted me as a friend and kept reaching out to me because he enjoyed my company, but he kept me in the limbo knowing that I was so available because \u201cI was expecting something from him\u201d (his words), and things would change if he would tell me the truth, so he didn\u2019t speak up. When asked if he thought about the impact this was having on me, he stared blankly and said no.**\n\nThe last bit especially sounded disgusting to me and got me thinking he could be a real narcissist. I had a gut feeling from the beginning that something was off, but I always excused him and refused to believe he could be like this.\n\nHe apologized, insisted he truly wants to be my friend and that he cares about me and wants us to keep talking. He is very likeable as a person, I do care for him and I really enjoyed having this support &amp; presence in my life, but of course for many reasons I don\u2019t know if I can do that now.\n\nDeep down I am still struggling and trying to explain to myself what didn't work, what is wrong with me.Is it my fault that I didn't manage to strike deeper feelings in him? **Is he emotionally unavailable because of his personal history or because of a narcissistic personality?**\n\nNow I've done a lot of research about narcissistic behavior and I have found some similarities.  I'm not sure if I\u2019m just confusing things after being discarded and treated as a second choice, but I am trying to make sense of him and what happened. These are some of the traits I might have recognized, if anybody feels like reading. (Otherwise you can just skip it, I'd just love to hear some stories or thoughts on the whole thing.)\n\n**General profile**\n\n* **The charm**: a very charismatic, handsome, fascinating guy, the alpha male in the room, a leader, good at talking and entertaining, very charming with girls, chivalrous. Always cool, never lost his temper, always the one in control.\n* **Confidence and display of high moral standards**, such as a strict adherence to truth, helping others and putting them before himself, loyalty and fidelity, independence and devotion to work.\n* **Subtle arrogance:** a lot of bragging, showing off achievements and telling stories of how others have acclaimed him for his intelligence and looks. Talks about being superior (but I was included on his pedestal, he never tried to put me down).\n* **Sometimes a bit cocky and condescending,** passive-aggressively demeaning certain people with short remarks and subtle looks. Never did that to me, except maybe once.\n* **Grandiosity**: throws casual statements about his selflessness and how he's always ready to do this and that for others, but then he's ranting about ungratefulness or making you regret exploiting his kindness.\n\n**In the relationship**\n\n* **The too-good-to-be-true love bombing phase.** He really got me thinking we were so compatible and that he liked me so much, took me on great dates, wanted to spend time with me, very attentive to details, romantic. Made me trust him, said \"we really clicked\" and I was special to him and repeated that for months, till the discard.\n* **Flattery:** during the very first few days he seemed to idealize me and treat me like I was some kind of angel sent to meet all his needs, he would constantly express awe at anything I did and said and was (he became more \u201cnormal\u201d in the following months but I was nearly suffocated with this attention). I was so pretty, so sweet, so smart, so fun.\n* **The questions:** he asked a lot of questions because he wanted to know me, like \u201cdo you like this or that,\u201d \u201cwhat do you fear\u201d, \u201chow would you act in this situation\u201d etc. On the other hand though, he opened up much more than I did.\n* **Self-centered**: a lot of talk about himself, about his struggles, his needs etc, little room left for the other person. Even in the relationship, he was constantly studying and testing me, concerned that I could fit his \u201cideal woman\u201d picture; the whole question was whether I was going to make him happy or not, never the opposite.\n* **Selfishness and using others:** It was all about him taking and never giving, as though he was entitled to that because he allegedly suffered from self-sacrificing in the past. I felt he was trying to take revenge on *me* because of the harm *his exes* had caused, for which he was still very bitter.It was always on his terms, especially later on. And the fact he used my feelings for him to keep me close as a friend and a listening ear and treated me like I was disposable is just the tip of the iceberg. He, however, didn\u2019t use me sexually and stopped having contact with me as soon as he knew he was not in love, because that would have ruined his morally upright perception of himself.I was always ready to listen to him, care for him, comfort him and give him advice, at any time of day, adjusting my time schedule on him.\n* **Deeply rooted insecurity:** I could see glimpses of his insecurities surfacing every now and then, his defensive reaction to criticism, his anxiety to appear righteous in every situation, having been bullied as a child and heavily criticized or abused by his partners etc.\n* Because of that, he was constantly **seeking for approval**, and I can see he could easily find it with me. He probably used me as a rebound and as a tool to boost his ego and restore his confidence after the painful and unwanted breakup. He was constantly reaching out to me to vent about people criticizing him and/or things that made him belittled and concerned.\n* **Seeking for attention** and not giving it back: there were phases in which he seemed very insecure, asking for my attention and worrying I didn't want to talk to him if I didn't reply to a text in 5 minutes; while at times, on his behalf, he would leave me on read for hours.\n* **The victim syndrome:** The constant talk about crazy, violent, abusive exes (and thank God I was so different from them, so sweet, so compliant and reasonable, a treasure to keep). Complained about being the one who always gives and never takes anything back (which is ironic in my case).\n* **The complicated family history:** an ongoing conflict with a negligent, irresponsible and unstable mother, a distant and idealized father, having to take responsibility for younger siblings and never being rewarded or cared for. He stressed a lot talking about childhood traumas his mother had caused him with her behavior. Gotta say he had reasons to, if he was telling the truth. Made me empathize with him, right from the first date.\n* **Intolerance of guilt:** he always failed to apologize even for mildly serious things; often remarked how he did not like being accused or made to feel guilty; I noticed his first concern was to clear his conscience and his public image, rather than the consequence of his actions on others.\n* **Mean remarks and triangulation (?)** At the end of the first love-bombing phase, right before he called for a break, he started saying lowkey mean things to me and looked at me weird to see the reaction.Example: talking about a friend who should just \u201csettle for the first decent-looking girl who\u2019s after him\u201d but then gave me a funny, mean look as to imply something. And then, with fake nonchalance, he started mentioning several girls who were texting him or flirting, and looked at me with a clearly mischievous, amused glance, waiting for my reaction. I didn\u2019t fall for it and acted indifferent. This meanness never came back again in the following months of our relationship, but it really threw me off, not because of jealousy but because he meant to upset me. He did, however, continue mentioning girls whom he thought he unwillingly charmed for all the duration of our dating relationship.\n* **The discarding/indifference phase**: maybe he was genuinely torn because I had failed his expectations and he still felt too much about his ex and whatnot, but there was a moment he turned very cold, ignored me, acted distant and avoided cuddling and touching, which was weird for a fresh couple of young people, also he used to be a very passionate guy. He could keep on the other side of the room from me for the longest amount of time, or get himself distracted with work when I was there, and every kiss or hug from him felt mechanical at some point. I felt like I had to beg for attention. Also he had some moments where he just vanished (mostly on Sundays) and never felt the need to explain.\n* I entered an **addiction cycle,** in which I was craving for my dose of attention and positive signals from him, with his calls, texts, looks, touching etc and I would freak out the moment he would not behave as expected. This way I was completely subjugate and available at all times.I became very insecure, mistrusting, obsessive and thought everything he did or did not do was a consequence of my own actions.\n* **Something empty** in his eyes when he talked about feelings, especially about his hurt from the past.\n* **Passive-aggressiveness** and inability to speak clearly, he often used metaphores, parallel situations, ambiguous remarks or even song lyrics to communicate.\n* **Lack of empathy?** When I asked what he thought I was going through as he kept me in a limbo for two months, he looked at me cold and clearly uneasy, and answered \u201cno\u201d, as though he was realizing then and there he had done some harm (but, I must say, he seemed mortified).\n\nHe is certainly on the spectrum; I\u2019m not sure, however, he is completely incapable of love as a narcissist should be. He has many regular, nice traits and lacks the worst, monstrous traits of the full blown narcissist.\n\nI\u2019m not sure he does not have feelings, maybe he\u2019s a very messed up soul because of his upbringing and does not know how to handle them. I don\u2019t think he intentionally meant to harm me, it was mostly unconscious selfishness that he can\u2019t help. Another thing is he never put me down, he never criticized me or gaslighted me and never made me feel belittled. He was always very supportive to me as a person and with my career. Also I think he genuinely liked me for some time, and did not mean to manipulate or hurt me. Despite his high opinion of himself he is not demanding, he is capable of self-criticism and can be sincerely humble.\n\nSo I'm wondering what caused things to go this way. Is it really narcissism? Emotionally unavailability due to the breakup? Or was it just me?\n\nAlso I am unsure what to do. Deep down I want him to regret losing me as a partner or at least as a friend, and maybe going no contact would be for the best, but I am not so sure.\n\nThanks to those who made it here. I\u2019d really appreciate talking to someone who has gone through something similar and hearing thoughts. I also hope this post will help someone like me.

{"post_id": "c1bp0k", "created_utc": 1560702062, "title": "I blocked her", "author": "[deleted]", "self_text": "I\u2019m almost in tears typing this. I have written here before but I will give a background story. \n\nI dated my ex for 6 months. From the very beginning of our relationship people warned me about her. They said she was a cheater, pathological liar, manipulator, etc. She seemed so kind, patient, and caring that I could not believe a word people were telling me and I went for it. There were small things in our relationship that bothered me but.... they seemed small so I didn\u2019t show a lot of concern. For instance, she wouldn\u2019t talk to me about her past... at all. I even asked her to tell me something good about her life that happened when she was younger even something small like one day her mom gave her a dollar or some shit and she kept saying whenever she opened up to people they let her down so she wouldn\u2019t. Because I felt that, I excused it. I have mental illness so I wanted to be very open and clear with her so I was at all times but I still didn\u2019t wanna force her because she said her past was hard to talk about. After doing an unnecessary amount of research and finding out she was opening up to one of my best friends about our relationship BUT NOT ME, I realized she was stonewalling. \n\n\nAnother thing. She\u2019s bisexual and I am a lesbian.. I came out to my family about a year or two ago and when I started falling in love, I wanted them to meet her. They did and loved her. I asked her when I\u2019d be able to meet her family and she constantly told me that if she came out to her parents they would kick her out.. That pissed me off so bad. One night while she was drunk she told me that her dad straight up told her that if she was happy he wouldn\u2019t care (I guess he knew somehow) and she told me she was going to tell him. I told her to hold off until she was sober just to make sure she was positive she wanted to. The next morning I asked her how she felt and she said she changed her mind. It hurt but I understood.. But she did this maybe one or two more times and when I asked her if she was still going to she would get upset and tell me I wasn\u2019t being patient with her. It made me feel terrible because my goal was never to rush her but I also hated being a secret. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about arguments. I have to talk things out because I believe things can always be fixed with proper communication. But, she would always shut down. Which.... in the beginning I thought was because of her terrible past but it was because it made her in control. If she said \u201cno I don\u2019t wanna talk about this\u201d and I tried to force her guess who looked shitty? I did!!!!! Any time I wanted to open up to her about how she hurt my feelings this would happen. Every. Single. Time. \n\nAnywho.... Things started to feel off but I knew if I mentioned it she would shut down and we would get nowhere but she started to ignore me a lot. She would text me maybe 1-2 every few hours and would only sometimes respond if I double texted her. I didn\u2019t want to do that anymore so I finally asked her how she felt about our relationship and if it was working and she broke up with me. She told me that she just needed space for a while to process and figure things out. It was hard but I said ok. I won\u2019t lie, I didn\u2019t give her space and that\u2019s my fault but something just didn\u2019t feel right. Before I started dating her I got out of a relationship where my ex \u201cneeded space\u201d and when everything cooled down she finally told me she just didn\u2019t know how to actually end things. I knew the game. \n\nMy faults come in a lot now. I constantly texted, called, tried to meet up, etc. We met up around 2-3 times and I was so happy but she didn\u2019t seem thrilled. After each time she would tell me she loved me and shit which made me think we still had a chance. Even one time she said she didn\u2019t know if she still loved me and didn\u2019t wanna say it if she didn\u2019t mean it but she then would say it. Every time I would make sure we were still good and every time she would say she still needed more time and that we needed to just be friends for now but never that we didn\u2019t have a chance. Maybe I was an idiot for not reading in between the lines. Probably. \n\nOne day I was having a rough day mentally and I blew the fuck up on her. I can\u2019t even deny it. I told her things I had been wanting to tell her for a while but she remained calm and even laughed in some of our messages which only made me seem more crazy. This was also the day that I found out she had been lying to me, hiding things from me, and even allowing her sister to be in the room during private phone conversations that we had. Does that excuse the things I said to her? Nope. I will take full responsibility for everything I did and said. I have to for my growth but that\u2019s also the last day we spoke. I reached out a few times but she ignored me every single time. I blamed myself because like I said.... I blew up a few times on her. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I reached out to a girl who was in an emotionally abusive relationship to ask her how I could redeem myself because I felt shitty about being so shitty and told her about my relationship that she told me that my ex displayed the same behavior that her ex did and that day everything changed... \n\nIt has been a long, very hard, healing process but I am everyday and I know it. But some days are hard. I still check her social media and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s holding me back so today I went and blocked her. I will no longer see her on my TL and when I got to her page i will be reminded of why I blocked her in the first place. I\u2019m just really proud of my own progress and I hope I continue down this path. \n\nTo everyone reading this and going through the same thing, I love you. Stay strong.

Made a small note with all his info in case I can use it. \n\nI can\u2019t stop being angry. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m avoiding being angry at myself.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve just replaced an obsession with an obsession. \n\nShort review - I\u2019m married. About two years ago things started to go bad, really bad. Family problems, struggling in a newish marriage, depression, bad career move. \n\nWent to therapy and wasn\u2019t clicking. Changed my meds a few times and felt worse. My husband didn\u2019t/doesn\u2019t believe in psych meds or much around mental health. I struggled and struggled until I was an empty shell of a person dragging myself through days. \n\nIt got so black and so deep I took all of my pills and tried to die. I lived, but the 72 psych hold did nothing and I continued with my ineffective therapist and meds just to keep going. It was dark and I was alone. \n\nLiterally, within three days of being released from the hospital, enter the N. One of my husband\u2019s best friends, a groomsman in our wedding. Within three days. \n\nYou all know the drill. Messages telling me how he understood. Gifts. Subtly putting down my husband for not understanding. Checking in on me and stopping by. Gradually making me feel like he was the only one who understood. Compliments to a person who felt so low she was willing to take her own life and to be honest it felt like the best thing in the world. Then, getting me alone. Offering me drugs I have never touched, which I took willingly, desperate to feel better. Or feel anything for that matter. \n\nI didn\u2019t see it. I guess maybe I couldn\u2019t see it then. But it\u2019s crystal clear now, and it was absolutely predatory. And I fucking fell for it. \n\nI probably don\u2019t have to even say where this led but of course it was sex and drugs behind my husband\u2019s back. \n\nI felt horrible but that escape kept me alive. \n\nThen came the devalue. And I obsessed and kept making contact. \n\nIntermittent reinforcement. Pull me in, push me away, pull me in...\n\nI\u2019d make a strong attempt to stop everything and he\u2019d Hoover. Then devalue, then discard, over and over until I was an obsessive mess who was using drugs with him, making me more unstable. \n\nA year and a half of this. \n\nI\u2019ve been in therapy with a new therapist specializing in addictions, especially sex addiction. \n\nI came completely unglued on him over text and used everything he ever told me in \u201cconfidence\u201d as prof he is a drug addicted loser. Insulted his sexual performance. Cut all contact. \n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t know. He likes the guy. And actually years ago he slept with the first girl my husband was going to marry and they didn\u2019t speak for years before finally fighting and making up. This would destroy him totally. I think I\u2019m going to have to carry this secret forever. I\u2019d feel better telling him what this price of shit did to me, but that would be for my relief and it\u2019s not fair. \n\nI\u2019m stuck working through my issues, trying to stay clean from the drugs, work on my marriage,  hurting for my betrayal to my husband, take care of everything I\u2019ve neglected...and he still lives his user life, sleeping with as many random women as he can pick up on Tinder. Which he threw in my face many times, once even sending me all the naked pics these girls had sent him and telling me he banged them all. \n\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks but I am so angry at N. I can\u2019t stop dreaming up ways to destroy him, hurt him, embarrass him... not healthy for me in the least bit. \n\nHow do I let I go of this anger? I know part of it is anger that I let myself be manipulated like that. Anger at myself. It\u2019s time to let it go and move on but I\u2019m stuck. \n\nPlease note that by expressing all this I\u2019m not trying to absolve myself of all responsibility. I know I have a hand in all of this. \n\nI just didn\u2019t see the whole picture till it was to late.\n\nEdit. I\u2019ve reread this a few times and realize it sounds like I am whining about having to do the work to be better and face the consequences of what happened. That was not my intent and I really apologize for coming off that way. \n\nI guess I just read enough to really realize the malice, the triangulation of my husband and I, the intent of not only destroying my husband but me as well and all the ways he fits the narcissist profile to a t. I was confused as to why someone would do this, then suddenly aware of how much of a target I was/am and now I\u2019m angry. \n\nI also came to realize that my first relationship with the father of my son consisted of tons of narcissistic/borderline psychopathic physical and mental abuse. Somewhere inside me I\u2019m addicted to this pattern and that makes me so sad.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I told him I'm going to my dads for fathers day and I asked if he was doing anything for fathers day (i considered his for babies as kids and figured would take them to the park of something) and he said No i dont have a father (passed away 15 years ago) and i dont have any kids. I said ok well u can do what u want then. Lol  Ok no biggies but he continued with even if I had a kid I would do what I want.....\n\nThat threw me off. I'm not sure how to take that.

We've always had the most complicated situationship... he always made sure I knew he was dating other women and free to do so, but lied to me about so many things over the last 2 years. We haven't been \"together\" since November, hadn't seen each other since March and had been NC for a month.\n\nI caved Friday and messaged something in reference to something we both enjoy, an event, that I knew he was probably at too. He responded immediately, asked where I was (at the event), and said he'd call me shortly. He did. He came to me right away, we hugged, caught up. \n\nWe walked around the event and got into why we hadn't spoken in a month (we never fought prior to the NC, I just completely pulled away when I knew he was likely dating someone new...which he admitted he has been on some dates.) Anyway, he said he wished we hadn't gone that long and should have talked but he understood why I needed to. Then I broke down and just completely poured it all out, ripped into him about all the things he said and did, throwing women in my face, ignoring my presence when he'd have me over, not talking to me for days on end, making me always feel like his last option and like I wasn't good enough, that this is the shit people go to therapy for, he had been a death sentence on my self-esteem and I never deserved any of it.\n\nTo my complete SHOCK... he teared up. It was genuine. I could tell he felt completely awful for everything. He told me he never meant to hurt me and was sorry he had, never did it on purpose, that he is a broken person and realizes he pushed me away. That he doesn't think he'll ever be ready to get serious with someone again and that's likely why he did the push/pull with me not realizing he was doing it. I kept telling him he was a liar, that I didn't believe him, etc......  pretty much ripped into him, which I feel bad about now because I do fuckin' care about him.\n\nAm I stupid to think he GENUINELY feels bad???? We're not getting back together or anything but did have a really long, good talk about it all and he apologized a lot. So I don't think there are ulterior motives... is it possible he does actually give a shit and didn't realize what he was doing? Or am I being completely naive?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

You take me sending you a Father's day card as another reason to sneak up to my door at night and leave me something snide and nasty.  It was actually quite difficult for me to do that, but you had given me a mother's\u00a0day card, and I decided to give the grace to you to receive a Father's day card. I guess I should have known that doing something nice for you can so easily backfire and become a weapon, and good intentions don't exist, when someone has a victim complex. You just don't give up on the attacks do\u00a0you? And it's funny how you come over here harassing me and waking up my whole household early in the morning, after weeks of relentless harassment and unwanted attention, and then make it all about me doing something to you? At least it (the phone call to your mommy that you live with, at 42 years old), got you to stop,\u00a0because that's all I ever wanted was for you to just freaking stop... the attacks, the onslaught of unwanted attention and visits and letters and notes and phone calls, at any time you feel like you wanted to force them down my throat, even into the latenight. I have asked you over and over to chill out, to please call me and make sure it's a good time before you decide to \"drop by\".  But you like to surprise me, because you think I have some imaginary guy hiding in my home, or some mysterious secret that you are going to discover, or catch me doing something that you can use to condemn.  You also spent months using spying apps on the internet to try to find out everything you possibly could about me and every person I know, even though I have known you for twenty years and told you every possible thing you could want to know about me.  On paper I am one of the most boring simple people you will ever find, yet you want to make me into some scandalous devious person with some scandalous secret life that doesn't exist. You wasted your time trying to find nothing, and now you know it.  it only makes me wonder what you yourself are hiding, that you would think there is so much going on behind the scenes.  I have begged you to stop sneaking up and banging on my bedroom window, often causing me to scream in fright because it is so startling, or waking me up out of a dead sleep and nearly giving me a heart attack. I begged you to quit waking up my household ringing my doorbell and calling both my phones until I have to unplug them, or leaving endless photos, property and nasty notes at my door, is not the kind of attention I was looking for.  Yet you want to convince me that all the times in the past, that you were ghosting me and ignoring me, is what you are trying to make up for now that we are broken up? That call to your mother also got me threatened, as if I had done the worst thing on the planet by exposing what you've been doing all these weeks, and who you really are. I have never seen anyone so self-absorbed, and then you use your alcoholic mother's smoking sicknesses as a reason\u00a0to get away whatever you like, and say and do whatever you want. Quit using your mother being sick (for years now) to pull at the heartstrings of everyone around you, and try and make me look bad. It is amazing the tools you will use for your manipulations,\u00a0and your mother being sick is somehow about you, not about her, everything is always about you, everything. And then you leave a message saying that I'm getting some kind of gain by calling your mother and expressing my feelings and my experiences, in the hope that somehow someone will finally get through to you? I made that call out of desperation, I have health problems and I cannot go through the stress any longer, it is flaring up the illness that caused my kidney failure years ago.  I used to be close to your mother, I was there for her the 10 years you were in prison, when no one else would visit her or talk to her. But you drove a wedge into that, because you found that you\u00a0needed to be the one that got the approval, since now you have your elderly parents manipulated into feeling so pitiful for you that they pay for all your bills, and tiptoe around you as if you need coddling, and let you sit around for five straight months not working. Did I mess up the extreme smoke and mirrors game you have going over there? You convinced them that you're\u00a0a victim, and all your repeated drug use and alcohol abuse, which began when you were 10 years old, is perfectly excusable, because I somehow made you do it. Do you have any idea how much your relentlessly obsessive phone calls visits and letters have done the final damage to any possibility we had to be together, even as friends? Not to mention the schizophrenic, paranoid, terroristic behavior and constant bizarre insanity/mental-emotional instability. The things you have going through your mind and coming out your mouth, are so downright disturbing that I just can't even listen to another word. And then you try to proclaim that I'm no longer part of the body of Christ, as if you gave\u00a0me my salvation and you're the one that can take it away? For being practically the most heathen, corrupted and dark person I've ever known personally, it really amazes me how you like to pull out the God card and use it as a weapon, anytime you feel like.\u00a0Not to mention the frequent abuse of scripture, only mentioned when you wish to quote what happens to certain wayward women in the Bible, as if I'm one of them and it should happen to me - even though you are well aware that I have not touched another man in 18years. So you label\u00a0me as the spawn of Satan, and doing the devil's work, simply because I tried to go no contact with you and stood my ground. \n\nIt's also very typical of you to take everything you know about a person and save it up for your personal use, so that later, if theydon't please you, you can turn it all on them and use it as bullets in your gun. Every single thing I say to you ever, becomes a weapon against me, even good things I do in my life or with my life or try to say or do, you always find a way to turn them around\u00a0into something ugly. Everything I ever gave you became something to throw back at me, everything I ever did for you became something that never existed, every dollar I loaned you became something I wasn't worthy of getting back, every hour I gave you of my\u00a0life became something I owed you the next day, and the next and the next, without any thought of what I needed to do with my time, God forbid I have a life or any rights to anything whatsoever, including sleep. Every prayer that you ever said was only to\u00a0get what you wanted, never to give God control and let him have what he wanted. As if God was going to manipulate situations for you, the way that you thought you could. Every time I was intimate with you, became something to use against me, because then\u00a0you owned me, and you could control me and shame me and put me down for it, and call me \"those\" names. You turned every potentially sweet thing into poison, you turned every good moment into a chance to drill your perpetual pain into me somehow. Took every opportunities to be\u00a0building up our relationship, and turned them into a chance to take withold from me that I needed from you, or to withhold something that you know you could put into my life and into our relationship. As if emotionally starving a person, yet convincing\u00a0them that they owe you everything and you are giving them everything, is going to create what you need in a partner/relationship. That is why there is no relationship, because you do not know how to relate. You are not even friendship material, having you\u00a0as a friend is having someone forever there to jab at you and look down on you and flaunt their next relationship in your face. I'm not stupid, I know you only want to keep me around for your own purposes, I know how useful I am and I know that you're aware\u00a0of my kind, generous, and helpful nature. I'm not interested inpersonally watching you tramp around with women like you did last time. I'm not going to be there to hear about the life you're living without me, because you promised to spend your life with\u00a0me, and you promised not to hurt me (that one was a huge lie) and you promised to protect and love me, and you did none of those, not one of them did you do. You actually became the most demeaning, threatening, hateful, destructive person I've ever had in\u00a0my life. Your idea of love is control, obsession, put downs, accusations, threats, expectations beyond anythings someone could bear or physically perform, someone who has no feelings or rights or critical thinking mind of their own and response as such, someone\u00a0who has new needs and doesn't expect you to keep your promises or be there for them when they need you, you basically expect someone not to be a person. They are just supposed to sit there and be there for you 24 hours a day, never speak up if they are mistreatedor you say ugly things to them, or you are using humor as ugly ways to jab at them, or if you are saying things about them or their thoughts feelings and behavior, that are absolutely entirely untrue. They should never speak up because then you will label\u00a0them as argumentative and contentious, discount everything that they have to say and ghost them until they agree to \"play nice\" again. They should never never expect you to pay them back or to take care of yourself or plan for the future or actually follow\u00a0through and make the future into something. What you expect is someone to be a puppet, to notice nothing and to say nothing, to pretend to be happy no matter how miserable they are, or they will be punished, and follow you through your roller coaster ride\u00a0of emotions and bad behavior and poor decisions and childish whims. They are supposed to turn their head when you brag about women flirting with you at your job, they are supposed to shut down everything in their life while you do whatever you want, and of\u00a0course not notice or say anything about it. You expect them to do the impossible while constantly being told that they are doing nothing right. You are allowed to be an utter hypocrite while they must be a saint, or pay the price. You expect them to endure\u00a0constant harassment and criticism of everything about them and the people attached to them, yet you continually want more information and more insider access and more total honesty, even though you are proving to be an unsafe and untrustworthy person, toxic\u00a0and unpredictable, harsh and unkind, self-centered and ugly. You also expect to play God over another grown person's life, and expect them to hand over everything so that you can judge it and condemn it, and they can seek your absolution, which will never\u00a0quite be achieved. You must always have the upper hand, You must always defeat and dominate, terrorize, manipulate, lie, make excuses or use guilt to get your way. Not just with me, I know there are others. Communication is the enemy, and the only communication\u00a0allowed is you talking about yourself and the really empty, boring or corrupt things that you are obsessed with in life. You offer absolutely nothing good, and therefore you are going to receive absolutely nothing from now on. I am bankrupt when it comes\u00a0to you.   I will not miss your harsh judgment and criticism, being lied about and scandalized and slandered, I will not miss being responsible for everything in your life, including your happiness, your sanity, your lack of motivation, your poor decisions, and your sobriety (or lack thereof).  I will not miss spending endless days and nights alone and being told that I am any number of foul names if I do anything else with my time.  I will not miss your constant insecurities and jealousy, and the strange thoughts that go through your head that I am always put on trial over, but and expected to convince you otherwise.  I will not miss how incredibly boring you are while you make everyone else around you think you're so exciting and interesting.  I will not miss how bad you are in bed, which I would never be so mean as to tell you about, and I will not miss how bad you are in general at just being a friend and a partner in life.\n\nI see now that you have used me all this time, that I was just a tool, that you don't know how to see a woman as a person or truly love anyone, especially yourself. The books will never be balanced, because you refuse to acknowledge that they even\u00a0exist. I had to leave you entirely so that I myself may exist again. You have done so so much damage to someone that was finally healed and finally looking forward to life again. The only reason I am not entirely broken is because I had become stronger\u00a0while you were gone, the only reason that I was able to get away from you, is because I learned about boundaries, I learned about healthy and unhealthy, I know when I'm being manipulated, and I know when someone is playing with my hair, I know what I'm worth\u00a0and I know what I need in life, I know what I offer and I know what I deserve and return. I didn't know any of that when I met you 18 years ago, but I grew up, and you are still a little boy. A scared, desperate, hurt, wounded, damaged little boy. You are\u00a0dangerous to women, emotionally, physically, mentally, socially, financially, spiritually, in every possible way. I fear for the next woman that doesn't see you coming... I fear for her life, for her sanity, for who she is before she meets you and who she\u00a0will be after you are gone, if she survives it.\n\nAs a side note, I am aware that many people would get a restraining order or move, and it is a long story but neither of these have been an option for me.  I knew eventually, something would get through to him. I know there is no guarantee that he will stay away, and it is painful to have someone who I considered a best friend many years of my life, for the sake of probably not having anyone else, to be nothing now to me but a memory. But an empty shell simply cannot hold my heart.  It is worth much more than that.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was in disbelief to learn that I, too, had a narcissist boyfriend, well, fianc\u00e9.\n\nWe had an on and off again relationship for 6 years since high school. I saw everything with him. My best friend forever, future father of my kids one day, he would pick me up when I was down and vice versa. \n\nWhen we were teenagers, of course things were easy. We both were not perfect people, no one is. I made sure I was there for him when he needed me, turns out he needed me all the time, I was okay with that for a few years.\n\nI tried things he wanted me to, and sometimes giving in because he would ask about certain things, I won't go too into detail but these things made me feel like a dirty person. Why? I suffered from sexual abuse several times as a child/toddler and he didn't think not once that maybe these requests might trigger dark memories for me. I still went ahead and gave him what he wanted.. because I loved him. \n\nHe went into the service for some time and our relationship turned into long distance. Honestly, I felt like I could breathe. He kept asking for things and there was just no way to execute them as he was not there with me, but man when he talked about these things with passion it started to scare me. \n\nFast forward a few years, we broke it off maybe about two times, seen other people, and came back. He was out of the service and came home and we got a place together. Im not sure what happened over the time we were apart and not together but when I looked in his eyes, I saw something else. Not someone, something, in the body of the guy I was willing to do anything for, so I thought.\n\nI started giving up on satisfying him, nothing seemed to make him happy but giving him what he wanted. Our arguments tripled over little things. We would say hurtful things to each other on the regular, we would disrespect each other. I say we because I honestly felt like I was fighting and I don't go own easy.\n\nHe got a new job that consisted of traveling 24/7 and he wanted me to go with him. After a few months of convincing, I quit my job, gave up looking for apartments after the lease was up, left my family, left my friends, left my home for this, for him. Things were alright the first couple weeks then things got sour. I started thinking clearly, I guess that's what staring into beautiful sunsets/rises do to you.\n\nI started thinking about how he, over these years, didn't really do anything for me but just listen. I don't ever ask for anything but do I have to? I mean in you're really into someone like you claim then you should at least be open about your feelings and have patience, among other things that are vital in a romantic relationship. Especially since we wanted to get married. Days went by and I started to erase those hopes and dreams of the future with him as I saw him turn into this thing over the course of years and now days. \n\nThe last straw.. this past March, we we're stopping to get fuel and he was rather frustrated with other drivers. His vibe, aura, groove, mojo, whatever you wanna call it, was very tense and angry on a level I in these years have never seen. He had an outburst that literally made me almost pee myself, out of nowhere like a bomb. Yelling, slamming and bashing the steering wheel with skin peels on his knuckles, im surprised he didn't break them. I froze in my seat and clenched so tight. I was terrified. It got dead quiet, in a scary nasty tone 'what is the matter with you?' he says. I started crying and I felt this mass of an aura just swallow me whole. 'Nothing' I said, he slammed his hands again and I started crying. I lied to him, that's why. We we're at each other's faces for the first time, I wanted to punch him, I wanted to slap whatever was inside him out. \n\n'And you wonder why I want to leave you', I said. I thought I was going to die from the outburst on that statement, I already felt dead.\n\nA lot of things have happened since, I came back home and I never wanted to hug my loved ones so badly until then. We are no longer together, broke off connections, gave back things and washed my hands of this. I learned that he was always this way, the narcissist in him grew over time and I tried to embrace it. I let those years go by when I could have been someone by now. \n\nNot to matter anymore. It's been since March that I let go and slowly im starting to come out of my shell when I didn't know I had one. I have a more positive mindset as it isn't clouded anymore. I can breathe, I can be happy all by myself. I guess I feel like a survivor? \n\nIf you're still here reading this then thank you. I've been meaning to get this off my chest but without the nasty details.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Long story short, we broke up about a month before my 18th birthday. He was the first guy to look at me in a romantic way. So, needless to say, I had little to no self-confidence. Which is what made me the perfect target for my abuser, who we\u2019ll call M. The night before my 18th Birthday, so Valentine\u2019s Day, my best friend at the time called me and told me to get ready as she was taking me on a double date with her boyfriend at the time and M. M would hold doors open for me, hold my hand, and showed a genuine interest in me. So, me being self-conscious, I grew a crush fairly quickly. That night, M dropped my best friend and her boyfriend off for the night and took me to a secluded area. One thing led to another, and I got my first kiss, and lost my virginity in the same night. When I got home, I had blood trailing down my chest because of how rough he was with me. I couldn\u2019t sit without pain for a few days. But that wasn\u2019t where the assault happened. I told my best friend that I didn\u2019t want to hang around M anymore because he was rough, and demanding, in ways I was not prepared for. Well, a week later, we all hung out again. I picked everyone up, and we went to a lake that was an important park of my childhood. My best friend and her boyfriend split off from M &amp; I, and were getting frisky on the other side of the lake. M and I were laying in the grass, watching the stars. I thought, maybe that\u2019s how it was supposed to be as I\u2019d never had any experience with intimate relationships. So I got comfortable. As we laid there, he made me touch him, and started feeling me up. I told him No and that I didn\u2019t want to have sex. I repeatedly told him this as he held me down and shoved his hand down my pants despite me forcing my legs together and trying to keep him out. He raped me. He only let me get up because my best friend called my cellphone to tell me that we needed to get home. As we get in the car, I\u2019m a mess, and M is bragging about how he got some with my best friend\u2019s boyfriend. I drop the boys off first, and I explain the entire situation to my best friend on my way to drop her off. Shes apologizing over and over again and said she would never leave me alone with M again. \n\nNow, for a bit of context for this next part; I didn\u2019t have a mean bone in my body back then. I was ignorant and thought that everyone around me had my best interests in mind. I thought, surely my best friend wouldn\u2019t leave me alone with M again because she promised. He can\u2019t do anything if we\u2019re all together right? I was the one with the car, and my best friend couldn\u2019t go anywhere unless i was picking her up, so I became the chauffeur. \n\n\u2014\n\nFast forward about a week later, and I\u2019m suddenly picking up my best friend, her boyfriend, and M. We told her boyfriend what M did, and he was LIVID. He put on this great show of how he was going to beat his ass, never see him again, yada yada. Now, again, because I put everyone else in front of myself, I told her boyfriend he didn\u2019t have to stop being friends with him, I just didn\u2019t want to be left alone with him or anything like that. Her boyfriend said he was going to get his shit back from M and that was that. Well, we all go hiking on this mountain, and lo and behold; my best friend and her boyfriend are nowhere to be found. And once again, I am stuck with M feeling me up, trying to have sex again. I\u2019m telling him no and pushing him off of me as best as I can. My best friend and her boyfriend are higher up on the mountain, without a care in the world. I make some excuse that we needed to leave, and tried to yell for help, and my best friend\u2019s boyfriend said \u201cOh come on OP, just 5 more minutes.\u201d \nAfter more back and forth, I convince them, although they are reluctant, to leave. \n\nFast forward about a month later, and me, my best friend, and her boyfriend are moving into an apartment together. Her boyfriend would lie to our faces and say he was done talking to him, but we kept seeing them messaging each other, he even went to a party with M. So, I made her boyfriend promise me that M wouldn\u2019t know where I lived, that I was with him, or anything about my life. Her boyfriend agreed. The first week we\u2019re there, I pull up to the complex, and M is walking by my car and he gives me this haunting smile and disappears. I call my roommates and beg them to walk me from my car to my apartment, and they said \u201cyou\u2019ll be fine. Just start walking\u201d. They wouldn\u2019t even walk down the 12 steps to make sure I was okay. After that, every night I would come home, her boyfriend would make me talk about M, and how he missed his best friend and how he\u2019s really a great guy if you know him. I was constantly bombarded with flashbacks and I no longer felt safe in my own home. One night in particular, her boyfriend told me he invited M over to hangout in the pool at the complex, just to \u201cgive you a heads up\u201d, and couldn\u2019t understand why I was upset. I told him if he was there by the time I got back that I\u2019d have a few of my guy friends with me and we\u2019d make him disappear, etc. (he wasn\u2019t there when I got there). \n\nNow, this entire time, my family has no idea what\u2019s happened and why I\u2019ve changed so much in just a few short months. My mom found out later, but she asked me why I didn\u2019t fight harder. She couldn\u2019t understand how he could hold me down. And she said she wasn\u2019t going to tell my dad because it would only make him angry. \n\nLong story short, I move out of state, and M continues to make new profiles so he can stalk my accounts, and when I went back to the state to visit a few friends of mine, I found out that he was still stalking me. He found out about my fianc\u00e9, knew his name, how long we\u2019d been together, that I\u2019d lost weight, what state I was in. He even found out my brother was moving to New Hampshire and made one of his profiles say so. I got a tattoo to remind myself that I survived an assault that a lot of people unfortunately, do not. Word travelled about what happened to me, and my dad called me screaming and cussing at me about how I\u2019ve branded myself for future assaults, and then found out my mom knew. My mom told him a different story, and I had to retell the entire story, and relive the trauma. My dad told me that the reason my brother broke up with his long time girlfriend was because of my assault; that his girlfriend couldn\u2019t understand why my brother was so angry. Everytime I\u2019m around my family, they find a way to bring the assault up. My poor fianc\u00e9, I only get to see him once a week, and if I\u2019m just getting off the phone with my family by the time I get to him, he gets greeted by me, bawling my eyes out. The nightmares are being triggered by smaller and smaller things. My boss patted my back to tell me I did a good job and it caused me to go home and have nightmares all night. Things are getting worse, and although my fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t make me feel this way, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to scare him away by being unable to escape my trauma. I got diagnosed with Anxiety, Depression, PTSD, and severe OCD. I take pills to help fight the nightmares and the rest of my mental health issues but I still find myself afraid that M is going to show up one day to get his revenge. I heard M tell my best friend\u2019s boyfriend on the phone that he was going to kill me, and talk about how badly he wanted to do it. If you\u2019re still reading this far, thank you. I just don\u2019t know what to do anymore, and I needed to get the full story out just to help myself and maybe get tips from those of you who come from similar situations. I\u2019m such a mess, and have been these last few months. My paranoia has spiked, and I\u2019m constantly looking over my shoulder. My dad blames me for being surrounded by him because of those times I picked him up afterwards. But, I didn\u2019t know any better. I was just a teenager, a kid. I thought my friends were supposed to watch out for me like I do them. I\u2019ve since cut them off, but for whatever dumb reason I tried to get closure with my best friend from that time, and she said that I ruined her life and I was a horrible person. I was traumatized, I was alone. How else was I supposed to react? There are still times where my fianc\u00e9 and I get intimate and we have to stop because one thing leads to another and I\u2019m suddenly back at the lake. I don\u2019t want to keep bringing it up to him because as I\u2019ve been told numerous times by my family, it\u2019s not fair to him  because I\u2019m making him feel like he can\u2019t help me or make me happy. \n\nHow do you escape trauma?\n\nEdit: I also found out that M had been showing my intimate pictures to my best friend\u2019s boyfriend and their friends, trying to pass me off to them and telling everybody I was a \u201cfreak\u201d. That was the night he told my roommate he was going to kill me. My roommate didn\u2019t see a problem with it.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

My mental state is bad anyways, so having two big topics on my mind made me want to vent and ask questions etc. (this is one of the big things in my mind) \n\nTwo years ago...? A very good friend introduced me to his girlfriend at the time. (Both living in another country, I did not meet them.) She seemed to be nice, was a few years younger than me and me, being assigned  the \u201cjob\u201d of trying to be her friend was very nice to her. \nI was a littler jealous, because my social anxiety makes me think, people aren\u2019t allowed to have other friends than me (Which is stupid to think of me, but I still do, I\u2019m working at it.) but I am very good at hiding this and still being genuinely nice.\nWe eventually became friends, me being there for her when she fought with her bf (my friend) and just generally chatting and being nice to each other. \nAt some point in time later, I went to the hospital for two months to get treatment for my depression etc. and it was going quite well. \nShe on the other hand had more and more fights with her bf, granted, they are both complicated people. I was beginning to be her rock and, me, being limited with my phone usage to evenings or something led to both of them being the main people I talked to, outside of the hospital. \nThat\u2019s when it began. She got sick, she constantly collapsed, she took medicine. Maybe it has been that way a little before already, but it magically always happened when there were problems in the relationship. \nWe were of course worried. Me, being completely useless in a hospital, kilometers away, got worse. My treatment didn\u2019t really help anymore at that time. \nThings got worse also. She seemed to have constantly been in operation rooms, having seizures, just generally being very unwell.\nWorry rose.\nMe and my friend were constantly trying to make each other a little more happy. \nThere were times, when she didn\u2019t text for a day. Sometimes someone else would \u201ctake her phone and inform us what was happening\u201d. \nApparently she had cancer. Lung cancer. 3th stadium, she was constantly telling us that she was going to die. \nWe freaked out, basically. \nThis went on. Until one day, my friend told me, things were a bit fishy. I didn\u2019t even think about that, but he was right. Some things didn\u2019t add up, she refused to show operation scars, she knew absolutely nothing about the illness she had, because \u201cthe doctors never told her anything\u201d which is unusual in the country she lives in. \nWe got more and more suspicious. Still worried, hoping, she\u2019d never be as stupid as to lie about that. \nThings got a little better, she didn\u2019t constantly die all the time or was rushed to the hospital because her heart stopped and sent home the next day. \nMy friend broke up with her and we got together for a while, just being a little happy, enjoying summer. \nWhen, after her being so desperate to get him back, arose the idea of including her in our relationship. We wanted to \u201ctry poly\u201d anyway. (Sorry, if that sounds offensive. But he still loved her and I didn\u2019t mind that much so that\u2019s how I\u2019m gonna call it.) \nI really liked her so I was positive. Pushed away the cancer stuff. It probably was true anyway, i kept telling myself.\n\nWe did not stay three people for long, her being weirdly possessive and also jealous of me made my friend break up with her again. \nShe sent me crying Voice Notes while I was at dinner with my grandma, complete breaking contact. \nI didn\u2019t hear from her. \nMy friend was very pissed. He can be a bit resentful (can\u2019t blame him here), so he tried to worm as many secrets out of her, using her affection for him.\n\nTurns out, she lied a lot. She lied about being sexually abused/raped by a classmate, which severely pissed me off. She told him, she did not love me (which, okay, I don\u2019t really care) but also did not even like me (which stung a bit more) and that, in fact, she did not have heart failure every time she stated it. She didn\u2019t confess to every lie that we accuse her of, but she also barely apologized. To him more than me, which I get, since she was his proper gf for some time. \n\nNow, she\u2019s not sick anymore. None of her friends knew she was. She is the \u201cvictim\u201d because maybe me and my friend told her to duck off a few times. \nI even reached out to her and apologized, for god knows what, I was drunk and sad and felt like I was at fault. She accepted the apology, still not admitting to her faults and barely being sorry herself, just calling me a \u201ccute bean\u201d and all that shit. She once said I was like a big sister to her, but I guess that was a lie too. \n\nWhen telling this to my sister, she basically laughed, saying that this was such obvious stuff. Oh well. \n\nThough, still. I have recently watched a video, and it contained a picture, with a face that reminded me very much of hers. Since then, I can\u2019t stop thinking about this. It makes me intensely angry, I have never wished harm upon people, but I just want her to be hit by a truck. I don\u2019t know how to deal with this intense anger, also this feeling of being betrayed and just very disappointed in someone I liked. \nI have her name carved in my leg, from when I was feeling very bad - I can\u2019t hear her name without completely clenching. Recently, my friend started talking to her again, just casual, and constantly commenting to me (and probably her), how glad he is, not being emotionally invested in her and that he\u2019s not in her friend circle anymore. \nBut I am.\nI still feel very strong emotions. And every time cancer is mentioned somewhere in the media, or in a conversation or anywhere, I get pulled back. \nI was used to thinking about my other grandmother passing because of cancer, and my aunt surviving cancer, both making me a little sad, but in a accepting way, since that was a long time ago. But now, her face and her actions have taken over this, and in some way - she has taken my grandmother from me. I used to at least remember her then, and smile, whenever cancer got mentioned. Now, I just get anxious and furious and can\u2019t concentrate. \n\nI have told my friend about me being triggered by that picture that looked like her: And he told me I should get over it. Not let it get to me. Move on, she\u2019s not worth my time. \nI know he\u2019s right, but I don\u2019t know how. There\u2019s so much bubbling underneath, and I don\u2019t know how to deal with it. \nThere\u2019s so many things she ruined for me just by liking them or mentioning them. I feel sometimes so obsessed with her, even though I just want to forget her and how she made me feel. \n\n\nTldr: A former friend/girlfriend pretended to have cancer and almost dying multiple times for attention, admitted she didn\u2019t like me somehow became the victim and is now haunting my dreams and thoughts, after being triggered to that memory again. \n\nWhat do I do?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Had been to a mental hospital for the criminally insane and everything. My mom, and my brother, and I finally didn\u2019t have to have any more contact with him about 8-9 years ago. I\u2019ve gotten my last name changed, my birth certificate changed, I\u2019ve been legally adopted by my dad. That man is no closer to me than a stranger on the street. And I was so happy because I felt like I was completely done with him ever having an effect on my life again.\n\nBut I guess not.\n\nI can\u2019t really remember any of the abuse, it was all verbal and emotional, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I was child and you naturally forget these things, or if it\u2019s repression. I do know that he would stress me out to the point of becoming physically ill. And I lived my life serving him. I was born to make him happy, and if he wasn\u2019t happy it was my fault. I\u2019ve talked about this with my mom and she said it was sickening how I was this 8 year old girl, but he was grooming me to be his mother. I had a problem with expressing emotion, or having any wants or desires because I felt undeserving. I constantly was apologizing for everything I did and easily driven to the point of begging for forgiveness. And I absolutely struggled with not being a doormat who did everything anyone asked of me. I had developed I guess something like OCD, I\u2019m guessing because of the lack of control of my life. Lol I couldn\u2019t control how stressed I was, but I can control how many times I turn the lights on and off before I leave the room. I never really considered I guess how abused I was until recently when I realized I regressed. I always felt like a faker, saying I had suffered abuse because I was so young and \u201cI had gotten better.\u201d\n\nEventually I learned to stop bottling up my emotions. I learned to accept kindness and gifts and express if I wanted something. And more importantly, I finally gained the strength to tell someone if I didn\u2019t want something. If I didn\u2019t want to do something. If I was not going to make you happy, I was going to make myself happy. And the OCD and nervous tics went away. And I really and truly would have said, it was like I had never been abused. I didn\u2019t have flashbacks, I couldn\u2019t even remember much of it! My behavior was totally normal now.\n\nThat was until I started dating my boyfriend. I\u2019m not sure why I regressed with him, he was my first boyfriend so I think it probably was because he was a close male figure, since I had the same problem with my brother, but managed to break it. But it makes me worry for any future relationships. I didn\u2019t notice I had regressed until we had broken up. It was just so easy, so normal for me to fall back into that behavior I didn\u2019t even see it happening. It started because I felt this need to make him like me more. The relationship was in a gray area for a long time, and I wanted to show him I could make him happy. And so I started giving him lots of gifts. I would change my opinions on things to suit what he thought. I would research his interests so I could learn about them. And then, I started getting stressed. My boyfriend struggled with depression, and so I literally couldn\u2019t make him happy a lot of the time. I would buy him more gifts and it wouldn\u2019t work. I would plan elaborate romantic gestures and it wouldn\u2019t work. I would say everything right, I would be sentimental, and I would drop whatever I was doing to do whatever he wanted. But it wouldn\u2019t work. And I just started feeling this stress. It was my fault. It was all my fault. I\u2019m not serving him enough, I\u2019m not doing enough and so he doesn\u2019t love me and he\u2019s not happy. I would spend literally most of my day thinking about him, planning what I was going to do for him next. What I was going to say to him. What I was going to do for him. It was like an obsession. An obsession out of necessity. I was going to be perfect for him. I was going to devote my life to make him happy. I needed to.\n\nEven though he didn\u2019t ask for it. And he had no idea what I was doing.\n\nAnother thing that I noticed was that if he was ever critical of something I did it would almost make me physically flinch. He tended to be an irritable person, and wouldn\u2019t directly be angry with me, but even hearing a tone of anger in his voice would fill with this\u2026 dread? Fear? I couldn\u2019t really describe it, but I would shrink up and start apologizing again and start thinking about whatever I was planning on doing to make him happy. And then one time, we were in the car and he was having a bad day and was in a cranky mood and he started telling me how the clothes I was wearing weren\u2019t appropriate for the weather (I was going to be cold). This was like an inside joke between us, but also he was sincerely fussing with me because he didn\u2019t want me to be cold. But I remember being in the passenger seat, hearing him fuss at me and then I suddenly felt this complete lack of control and fear in my stomach. And in a weird way I felt like I was a kid again. I mean I know I wasn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t physically feel like a child again or believe I was a child again, but I just *felt* it. I felt like I had my 8 year old brain in my head again. And I had never, ever had that happen to me before.\n\nI just look back now and I feel so stupid and mad that I fell into that behavior again. When it wasn\u2019t like I was with another abuser. It wasn\u2019t like he was encouraging my behavior. I just did it all myself. It was natural to me. And it pisses me off. I just feel betrayed by my own brain I guess. I really thought I was all better. I could pretty much forget that whole part of my life. And now I feel like this dumb little girl. I just did it all myself. I did it to myself. \n\nWe broke up for many reasons, many that in no way related to my childhood abuse. But when I told him how stressed I had gotten and he asked what he did that stressed me so much I finally realized it.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just posting this to vent. And I guess I want to know if anybody else can relate. To the situation I was in as a child, or about regressing later in life.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

For obvious reasons, this is a throwaway account, and also keep in mind that I\u2019ll be talking about sexual abuse. For those reading, consider this a trigger warning.\n\nI guess I\u2019ll get straight to the point - I was molested by my uncle when I was seven. He was living with us while my dad was trying to help him get on his feet (he was from my parents\u2019 native country, we live in Canada). I remember in the beginning he would do little things that lead up him molesting me, such as putting my hand on his pants, letting him give me back massages, etc., but didn\u2019t understand how bad it really was, as I was a young seven year old. Needless to say, I never said anything to my parents even though I felt so disgusted with myself. I was always an obedient kid growing up, and was raised to trust anybody and everybody older than me.\nI then remember him getting a girlfriend and introducing himself to us. That\u2019s when the abuse stopped from when I remember, and I also remember him pressuring her to have sex in front of me. They eventually moved out together, got married and had a kid.\n\nSeven years later, everything came back all at once after suppressing it for years. I\u2019m not sure what triggered it, but I ended up crying and confessing everything to my aunt who was picking me up at the time. She was shocked and ended up telling my parents that night... it was so emotional. I thought it was going to get better after that... it got worse.\n\nMind you that I was FOURTEEN when this all occurred. I was still a kid and could barely make fully rational decisions at the time. This is important to the story, as I was still a minor and basically went through this on my own.\n\nMy aunt then proceeded to tell the entire extended family what he did. I\u2019ve been told that they all had a family meeting with my uncle and as expected, he was crying his eyes out and telling everyone I was lying. Another uncle urged my aunt to take me out and sneakily \u201cinterrogate\u201d me to see if I was lying or not.\n\nShe asked me questions that still make me upset to this day - \u201cwhat were you wearing? why didn\u2019t you tell anybody? are you lying? are you doing this for attention? this is a serious allegation, when this is brought up to court, you\u2019ll mess up his entire family and his kids will grow up without a father.\u201d\nSince this was a long time ago and I suppressed some of those awful memories, there were some details I could not remember and she invalidated everything I said.\n\nNow the real fucked up thing was... my parents and my grandparents wanted to sweep it under the rug. My parents thought they would be \u201cprotecting\u201d me by not even bringing it to light. However my grandmother\u2019s and others\u2019 reasoning shattered my heart - \u201cI\u2019m begging you to not tell the police because think of his kids. You\u2019ll ruin his family. Bring it up to God, he can heal you\u201d. At the end of it, my parents gave ME the final decision to press charges. Everyone was pretty much guilt tripping me into not telling authorities... so I didn\u2019t. It was a difficult decision as a minor fourteen year old, I was so afraid of the outcome. Turns out my extended family never believed me, and even fabricated rumours about my own mother telling me to lie.\n\nI\u2019m 19 now and it still fucks me up to this day. The sexual abuse screwed up my perception of love and trust. I\u2019m so angry and hurt because nobody stood up for me when I was a kid, and nobody cared enough to ask me how I felt during the whole thing. Most of my family wanted to protect HIM and HIS family, and cared more about reputation above anything else. I wish someone stood up for me, urged me to tell somebody. I wish it wasn\u2019t so hard to talk about it. To this day, whenever I bring it up to talk about it, my family tells me to \u201clet it go, forgive and forget\u201d and don\u2019t understand how fucked up it all made me. I avoid family events as much as possible. I\u2019ve brought myself to therapy ever since then but still find it incredibly hard to live with all this suppressed anger and sadness. Some nights it hits me harder than others, and I guess tonight is one of those.\n\nIf you made it this far - thank you for reading. I know it\u2019s long and I rambled during some parts, but I also feel like I needed to tell this traumatic story in case someone is going through the same thing I did and is feeling very alone.\n\nThank you so much guys", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I stopped missing him and I\u2019ve come to realize that I 100% made the right decision in leaving him, which is something I wouldn\u2019t be saying a month ago. I wouldn\u2019t feel as free as I do now. The relationship itself was only 2 months so not that long at all however I sometimes find myself rushing through life the way he rushed me. He would always get in me about not having my own apartment on my own saying \u201cwe need to get our own place ASAP so get your shit together\u201d meanwhile he\u2019s running a successful yet also unsuccessful business that pays extremely well but he doesn\u2019t know how to mange his money whatsoever. He would easily blow $600 in one day on food and weed and be broke by the end of the day. He was convinced that at the age of 30 was when you\u2019d be able to tell if someone \u201cmade it\u201d in life or not so he wanted \u201cus\u201d to get our shit together when in reality it was just me because he needed his habits which mind you were \u201cjustified\u201d because of all the things he\u2019s been through in life. So he always pushed me and at times it was very helpful because I needed hat push but it wouldn\u2019t be helpful when he would scream at me... asking why I\u2019m nobody in life. Or when he\u2019d see me crying because of the pressure he was putting on me and threatening to leave me yet didn\u2019t care. Anyways. I find that I still pressure myself to a breaking point like he would break me. It\u2019s becoming overwhelming and I wish I could stop. I\u2019m no longer with him and I\u2019m better off without him but some of the qualities of the relationship have stuck with me. Has this happened to anyone else? Not only that but he had bad road rage and would get triggered over the smallest of things like someone not turning fast enough.

Lots of future faking. I'm pretty much an open book, and I have empath written all over my face. I was married to an actual classic narcissistic man for 10 years, and I let this \"nice\" man totally walk all over me while wearing rose colored glasses. He wasn't really one to argue or fight like my ex was, but certainty went back and forth on things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* within the first few weeks he'd say things like \"I'm looking for forever love\", which obviously I am too- I just don't openly say that.

Normal people don't say this stuff. \n* he told me that he'd told everyone about me. he had me meet his brother after 2 weeks of us being official. I told him i was nervous since that is a big step and he said \"my girlfriend should know that i'm smitten about her, and most of the time i'd be nervous too, but I'm not with you\" While he was stand off-ish on me meeting his family who was local to the area \"they get attached quickly\"\n* early on during sex he literally freaked out on me because I couldn't have an orgasm. He said \"my ex couldnt have one, and it was a huge issue\" First of all, this is less than 5 times, and secondly, you dont know my back story. THIS IS WHERE I SHOULD HAVE RUN! I did not, he asked me to stay the night after I said I should leave. He said he was sorry the next morning, and we discussed things- and he asked for sex again.\n* what he often thought at the beginning was endearing- jokes, or me messing up my idioms, or being silly -seemed to start bothering him. He'd correct me, or say something in a demeaning way when he used to think it was cute.\n* he made me feel comfortable about speaking about my past, or my terrible childhood. He'd say things like \"I'd never hurt you\" \"if you stick by me, i can give you everything\" But he was shady as fu\\*k about what he'd share with me. He'd go from being really open to half stories. All his ex's were terrible people, though he never really talked that badly about them, but based on his half assed stories it was all their fault.\n* his social media is full of selfies, posts about his band, or his sharing his \"good deeds\" at work.\n* he has an older son that he seemed to use sob stories with me about how his son was sick and all he used to do for his son when he was sick.\n* he seems to only be friends with people he works with or people who don't live in the area. One of his \"close\" friends was friends with his ex prior to their relationship. Looks like he probably used a smear campaign on him to get him.\n* he texted me all the time, and then when he discarded me told me \"we text too much\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe seemed to try and pick fights or make me feel self conscious about things.

He came over one night and he seemed a bit cold, but said he was stressed. We'd made plans to go out of town the following weekend. The next day he came over and said \"he didnt want a relationship, and we texted too much\" and started crying.  \"your feelings are too strong, and if this was me a few years ago I would have just stayed with you and dumped you in a few years\" Which seems par for the course as all 5 of his previous relationships in the last 8 years have been 2 years long. I'm almost jealous of those relationships because mine only last 4 months.  I don't think I'll get a hover from him. He seems to discard and not return. I'm hurt that I let myself fall for this.

It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve seen her, and I thought it would be a great time for me to get away from home with everything I\u2019ve been dealing with. \n\nTo kind of sum things up, she recently got an apartment with her \u201cnew\u201d girlfriend (I recently found out that she\u2019s an old ex from maybe 10 years ago). When I came to visit, it was kind of awkward, because I didn\u2019t expect to see her there. My sister was recently separated, so I didn\u2019t expect her to be in a relationship. My sister said that she just showed up one day with all of her things. Okay, kind of weird. Anyways, I initially planned to stay for a month max and then return home. However, things happen and I ended up having to stay an extra month. \n\nThis is where things made a wrong turn. This mini-vacation turned into a min-nightmare. \n\nThe longer I stayed, the more I started to learn about my sister\u2019s relationship. When it comes to things like this, I usually try to avoid budding into people\u2019s personal stuff.\n\nI woke up in the middle of the night around 2am because I heard a door slam and something  that sounded like furniture being tossed around. My sister\u2019s girlfriend comes storming out of the bedroom and into the kitchen and begins throwing pots-anything that she can get her hands on all over the place. It\u2019s the middle of the night, so I\u2019m trying to figure out if they were arguing before or if something bad happened to cause her to behave this way.

Okay...\n\nAbout two or three days later, I\u2019m in the living room watching tv, when all of a sudden, her girlfriend comes in and accuses me and my sister of tampering with the ac unit. She goes completely haywire about it, calling my sister names, saying she\u2019s stupid and weak, amongst other things that I can\u2019t say here. This verbal abuse continues for another week and a half. And it becomes more severe after my sister loses her job. \n\nNow, it\u2019s as if the entire apartment is a prison cell and her girlfriend is the CO. She tells her when she can and can\u2019t go outside, eat, drink, use her phone, watch tv, what volume to set the tv on, etc. She can\u2019t even go to the bathroom without her sitting in there with her. When her girlfriend isn\u2019t here, I try to talk with my sister, because this is definitely a toxic situation and I won\u2019t be here for much longer to do anything if things become physical or more severe. But at this point, she has become fully compliant with everything that her girlfriend is doing and expects of her. She goes out of her way to try to not upset her, which is basically impossible, because she\u2019s always angry about something or nothing. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve never dealt with anything like this before, so I don\u2019t know what options I have/what options are available to her.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

You will never be the one thing that holds me above water. There will be other things that I find joy and happiness and comfort in. That being said, you will however be the keystone to it all. You may have learned in AP Bio that a keystone species is the species that holds the habitat around it together. It is the sole reason the beautiful things around it are allowed to exist in harmony. You will be my keystone. You will be that which allows me to find comfort and enjoyment in things other than yourself. This is not a godly status, nor is it worthy of worship, but is an integral piece to a beauty much larger than itself. The keystone species allows the body of nature to thrive. Without the keystone there would be nothing, yet without the rest of nature, the keystone would be meaningless. You are my keystone.\n\u200bThe way I act tomorrow is not an act. I will not have a fake face on, or a mask. Will not fake my laughter or forge my smile in poor metal, but show truly what it is to be full. Physically and mentally full. It is possible it will appear fake to you, and perhaps even repulsive as a result, but it is genuine. It will not be not a glowing smile or a huge boost in charisma, I am aware. But it will be simple. It will be simple and easy and effortless. That is what I wish to be, and I hope that I can prove tomorrow that I have the capacity and willingness to do so.\n\u200bI see now how valuable you are, and how valuable and meaningful your thoughts and opinions and desires are. I see that you have needs and wants the same way I do. I also see that they do not always need to be lined up with one another, and that we may not always want or need the same things from each other. In that same regard, I also see that we will not always be willing or able to give to each other what it is that we need or desire. That does not mean that we are incompatible. It does not represent an irreparability between our strung and dried out relationship. It means that we are real human people. It means that we will not so smoothly fit together like puzzle pieces, and that when jagged edges appear, contortion is not the solution. I must love the parts of you that do not quite exactly fit against myself, and I understand how to now. I understand how to see something that belongs to you outside of me and still find it to be just as beautiful as that which finds its place alongside my own desires. I know now how to see you as you are, jagged and smoothed edges, and truly love every manifestation of your genuine true self.\n\u200bI know how to have desires without having expectations. I know how to make a request without making a demand. I understand now how to express a need without pointing fingers at you for not being able to meet it. I know how to talk without yelling and disagree without calling names. I know how to love you like you deserve, and I know that I can be satisfied with exactly what I am given in return.\n\u200bI see now how trivial flesh is, and how temporary fleshly desires are. I see now how little it truly means. I am willing and able to be with you without forcing you into a contract or promise of sexual intimacy. I will allow that to be a spirit which can be comfortably and piously grown. Grown on standards set and held by both of us as equals. It will be a spirit which manifests itself naturally, and not at the artificial will of the flesh. It will be true genuine intimacy, and it will take time to become what it should finally be. We began this relationship under the idea that we would \u201ctake it slow,\u201d and we must now return to those roots that made us. Regardless of the emptiness and heartache of these last couple of years, neither of us can deny the true tether that has formed between us. An undeniable connection that reminds us that we want each other. This bond was created outside of fleshly desires, and it will be restored and preserved in the same way. If you never want to send a nude photo of yourself again, you are free to make that choice. I now have the freedom inside of myself to not mind that decision. I can now feel liberty from my own prison by freeing my only prisoner from it: you. Sex will never become an obligation again. Ever. Sexual intimacy should represent a true intimate spirit, and between us now, it will. Sexuality between us will be out of a place of love instead of hate, and it will be taken one step at a time. Each step taken by both of us, willingly, simultaneously, and gracefully. You are freed from the sexual prison I have held you in for so long.\n\u200bI give to you the comfort in knowing that you are allowed to forget things. That I understand now how unfair it is to blame you for that which is out of your control. That if you fall asleep without telling me so, it is not a slight against me. I now posses the maturity and confidence to see your true intentions, and true feelings.\n\u200bI give you this message in faith that we can be something. That you will allow me the chance to be what I should have been all along, for I now know exactly what it is I need to do. It would not be any simpler if it were spelled out on paper in front of me. I know what you mean to me now, I know how valuable of a soul I am allowed to share my life alongside of, and I know now that I can make every wrong right. I am asking you to take this leap of faith with me.\n\u200bI see how much children mean to you. I see the value that they have. I see the place they have in your heart, and I see your true and deep desire for them. I see everything now. I want to have children with you and raise a family with you. Not in the spirit of bending to your will and your desire, but in the spirit of understanding. I understand how deeply you wish to be a mother, and as a result it only makes sense that I should be just as willing and wishful to be a father. Any gift I give to you is a gift also to myself. A happiness given to you is a satisfaction given to me. It is through the spirit of providing and maintainability by which I have reached this conclusion. If children really have that deep of a place in your heart, it only makes sense for me to wish to meet you there. I will never hate my children, and I will never resent you for \u201cmaking me have them.\u201d I will love them and raise them the best way I know how. I will learn and make mistakes beside you. We will buy cribs and car seats, toys and tiny toilets, walkers and pacifiers, roller skates and nerf guns, skirts and dollhouses, and children\u2019s movies and board games. We will raise children together and fashion them to represent our family in a way that would make us proud.\nWe will become the Kelley household, and we will not do everything perfectly, and not everything will be smooth. Not everything will be easy, and we will not always be proud. Sometimes we will try to harmonize with each other but instead make dissonance between our clashing notes. Sometimes our children will love us, and sometimes they will wish we would just go away. Not everything will be perfect and flawless, and there will be no road we take together that does not have at least a single pothole. We will not be flawlessly perfect, but instead, perfectly complete. Completeness comes from satisfaction. Without hardship, there can be no sense of accomplishment, and no satisfaction. Without contrast, there can not exist beauty. We will not be the model family that never made mistakes or wrong turns, we will not always handle our money the right way, we will not always make the right friends, and we will not always make the right judgement calls for our children or pets. We will, however, be beautifully imperfect. We will shine a light so bright that the world will notice us. Other children will wish their parents would act the way we act. Other couples will wish for the intimacy that we share. Other relationships will search for the bond that we have crafted with one another. Our light will shine to everyone that comes into contact with us. Our light will flicker sometimes, and maybe even occasionally dull out, but it will never die.\n\u200bRight now, our light is bright.

He said out of nowhere \"my exes keep trying to call me from different numbers, so I have them all blocked.\" Weird, but whatever. They were all just numbers that were blocked. I never questioned it. Then a few months later he said \"my phone won't let me block just a number, I have to put them as a contact in my phone in order to block them\" which WE ALL KNOW is a lie. You don't have to make someone your contact in order to block their number. It was like this random obsession with making me understand (even though I had never asked) why he had so many blocked numbers.\n\nThey say when someone is lying, they give too many details. I realize now that all the blocked numbers were most likely other women he was trying to run game on while being with me. He blocked them so their calls and texts wouldn't come through when we were together. Then when we were apart, I'm sure he unblocked them and did whatever stupid shit he was going to do with them. \n\nSo, if you think your dude is messing around, don't check his messages and calls, check his BLOCKED messages and blocked phone numbers.

But I feel that the people here can hopefully relate to some of this.\n\nMy parents, especially my mom, are really strict. To get an image of her, although she can be pretty nice and pleasant at times, at her worse she is extremely strict, very controlling, and can get really angry over small things. \n\nI usually have to hide some aspects of my friend group (Some of them have substance abusing/neglectful parents, and they aren't the best of people, but they're really kind and helpful). I have to pretend to be some clean-cut, goody two-shoes, Straight-A piece of shit, because that is what she wants me to be. I keep things like internet friends, money and other things I do a secret because she'd get really (unrealistically) pissed if she found this out. Some of these things are really small too.\n\nFor example, I went to Cedar Point (A popular Rollercoaster park) last week, and she gave me $30. I spent like $23 on stuff, and some of it wasn't good (she only allows me to buy food). The next morning, she asked me what I had and how much each item cost, so I tried to lie, but I was tired and she could see through it. She got really angry about all that and how I can't be wasting money on extra or useless stuff (She wanted me to eat/spend the least I could there).\n\nSo, now back to the main part.\n\n(For some context, I'm F(14), I don't have a close relationship with my family, and I'm more of a reserved and introverted person who enjoys alone time, and only likes interacting with a few people/friends. My family is the complete opposite. I usually feel really uncomfortable around them.)\n\nRecently, she's started taking away my freedom to go out and do stuff. First, she told me I couldn't go biking anymore because \"someone could kidnap me\". I really enjoyed biking and it was one of the few healthy ways I cope with whatever the fuck is wrong with me. And I also could go anywhere I wanted without her knowing (She only let go to a certain neighborhood near mine), so that kinda hurt me. So, basically I couldn't leave my street by myself.\n\nShe also forced my dad to come along with me whenever I went places to make sure I'm \"safe\". My dad's pretty respectful and keeps his distance, but it's still pretty uncomfortable having someone follow me all the time. \n\nShe's also stop letting me go to some of my friends houses because she \"doesn't like the area they live in\". I can barely see my friends now because of that, unless she or my dad is there with me, stalking me all the time. My friends and I are the kind to cause a little bit of harmless trouble and what-not, acting like the average teenager. But, like I said, my mom wants me to be a goody two-shoes and all that shit.\n\nI get that she wants to keep me safe, but I need privacy. And if my mom finds about the parts of my friends she wouldn't like, she won't let me be friends with them anymore. \n\nSince a lot of my friends are busy, I basically can't leave my house, unless it's with my mom. If I do leave the house, I'm basically on a leash and I can't leave my mom's sight.\n\nIt hurts me a lot. I feel so confined and trapped. I can't do anything I love and I have to pretend to be someone I hate. I'm seriously tempted to run away or something like that. I'm not allowed to have any freedom, independence or whatever. It's extremely painful to be sitting around on a beautiful day doing nothing, because I can't get out of my house. The loneliness and pain is getting worse and I don't know what to do?\n\nCan someone give me some advice or help?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

She was part of an old group of childhood friends and she liked me, and she started pursuing me back in the fall of 2017. \n\nI never really thought about a relationship with her before, but I always admired her intelligence, independence and apparent stability. We eventually started dating in October 2017 and she pressured we became exclusive by December of that year. \n\nShit hit the fan by January 2018. This happened not 24 hours after being intimate for the first time with her: she blatantly flirted throughout the night of Christmas Eve with an old fuck friend that I didn't know about right under my nose.  I'm not gonna get into details, but the subtleties of one of the acts (the guy wanted me to see certain things, he made sure she knew he wanted me to see those things, and she had no reaction to any of it) made me have a breakdown that night after everyone left (we were at her place btw). I started crying saying I don't understand what the hell happened, she always said how she hates flirty guys that are all about sex and she's actually repelled by their touch and how lucky she is that I'm not like that. My actions always follow my words and it was literally shocking she acted so against her words. She admits to having had sex with that guy before but it was a long time ago, like that was supposed to justify any of it. Anyways, I wasn't having it and kept pushing for answers and pointing out incongruencies between her actions and words. I know I should have left that very moment and never look back, but I just fell so hard for her...\n\nBy the end of December, everything she had put on the table (exclusive relationship, meeting family, vacation plans for the summer, me moving in, kids - I know, lots of red flags) were replaced by dead stares, smirks of satisfaction at my suffering and confusion, playing with my fears, ignoring me, making plans then cancelling, \"forgetting\" or changing them on her own accord, sarcasm, put downs, fault finding. This lasted until the final day together (around May last year) when I decided I had had enough. Cheating was probably happening too, but I was just too tired and upset to even try and find out, there was a gut feeling it was happening, I think she even left clues I chose to ignore because there was no winning anyway. \n\nNot one month into the breakup and no contact initiated by me, friends find out she's in a relationship with a coworker. By Christmas last year, she gets into her third relationship with an old friend of mine which I haven't kept in touch with for a very long time. This \"friend\" chose to distance himself all of a sudden way back, I hurt a lot back then, but that's a different story. It couldn't have been better: two of the people I thought the world of break my heart a second time.\n\nAnyway, I've been NC for a year and almost two months. I blocked her on FB and blocked her number. I opened an Instagram account and she tried following me there three months into NC but blocked her there, too. I didn't even peek once all this time. But it still hurts. It's indescribable how much it hurts. I lost my childhood friends because I can't allow myself to see them as a group because she might turn up anytime. I lost my ex as a friend , as a lover and as a human being. I lost myself. \n\nI'm a diagnosed socially anxious person and it's so hard for me to make friends. And a year later, this bleeds so hard into my life. I feel so isolated and alone. I cherished that group very much and having them ripped out of my life hurts so much. Nobody questioned her and she apparently has no problem going out with them like nothing happened. I still keep in touch with some of them but in very small groups of three people tops. I've met with two of them today and had such a good time. It felt like the old times and this has sent me into a spiral of sadness and despair knowing it will never be the same. I still have close friends that are on my side in that group but they never openly picked anyone's side and they are passive about her being a part of a group.\n\nI wish I never knew her that way and I just want my life and my friends back. She destroyed so much of what I held dear, it's so hard to get over it...\n\nThank you so much for taking your time to read so far, it means a lot to me to be able to tell my story here, among people who've been through the same, or worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR I'm a socially anxious victim of abuse that has lost his childhood group of friends and is very lonely, desperate and just wishes his life went back to normal", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I had no idea this was wrong or weird and i'd carry on doing this until he made me stop. I vividly remember him spitting on his dick as lube. The reason he used to make me stop was because he'd come and gone soft. Obviously me being a child wouldn't have known this, and it's only as I discovered what sex was I realised why he made me stop.

I've been freaking out for over 18 months on how to tell my dad he's not welcome at my wedding. Me and my father have never spoken about the abuse and i've always been civil if not distant from him. Maybe he thinks I don't remember or maybe he genuinely thinks he did nothing wrong? Who knows? So a few months ago I sent my dad a very long message explaining that I remember the abuse, that I do not want him at my wedding as the thought of him walking me down the aisle makes me feel sick and that I haven't told my parents as I feel that my younger brother probably benefits from whatever relationship they have. I told him not to push me on this and that my mum and stepdad are fine with him not attending the wedding as they no we have no relationship.\nNot sure why i've posted this, just feel like getting it off my chest a bit.

However, I can't be sure so I wanted your opinion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy relationship started off super fast. In that, I mean the love bombing. He flirted with me a lot, told me how beautiful I was, he couldn't stop touching me (e.g. hand holding, cuddling, etc.), bought me flowers and was always taking me out and about. By the third date, we were official--technically, when I asked him, he said \"I thought we were official from day one.\" He made plans about the future: the dog we'd get, how we'd move into the second house his parents were currently fixing up, showing me the place and then telling me how we could turn the second floor into a library for me...\n\nI was ecstatic, he was my first and he gave me a dream I'd always wanted to have with a significant other. He introduced me to his friends and would always think about me. But a few months later his entire demeanor changed. He was no longer the person I knew from the beginning. He became cold and distant. Stopped bringing me to hang out with his friends. His mood fluctuated: if he was feeling great, he'd give me all the love I craved. When he was feeling shitty, he was silent. It would make me so anxious because I wasn't sure what I did or what he was thinking. It was like the silent treatment.\n\nThere was no communication between us. When I did want to express something, he'd shut me down. In that, I mean he dumped me. I made the mistake of begging for him back. Since then, I had the \"walking on eggshells\" feeling every day around him because I was terrified that in speaking up, he'd dump me again. I felt like he devalued me because he would prioritize his friends all the time. He'd only see me if he felt like it. When I tried to suggest something, he'd throw a fit. We never fought, he was pretty passive-aggressive. I felt like he didn't want to do anything with me in the end. He'd go out with his friends and not even tell me about it. I only hear about his activities from mutual friends or social media. He basically kept me in the dark.\n\nI once told him about my dream position at my job and he shot me down and told me I wouldn't make it because \"I'd give up eventually.\" I once tried out a new hairstyle and he mocked me for it by gesturing at it and saying, \"What is this?\" He said it teasingly, but it still made me feel bad. The first time I lost my virginity, he didn't say anything sweet. Instead, he said, \"I haven't done this in a while.\" Sex always ended with him bouncing right up and doing homework or something or just not even cuddles towards the end. I feel so used by him. I feel like he was only in it for the sex, but never a relationship even though he always claimed we were together. I don't think a boyfriend would only see you when he felt like it, throw fits when you want to celebrate a holiday together or go somewhere together, or not even message you when you aren't together physically.\n\nWhen we went to Vegas together, he wouldn't stop making jokes or comments about the stripper ads with his guy friends, who were obviously uncomfortable with how ecstatic he was at the idea. Ex. \"Let's invite those girls to our room!\"\n\nTo his friends, he's so sweet. He's charming, funny, sarcastic, outgoing, yet with his family, he's the opposite. He ignores them most days (dinner is very quiet), doesn't go on family vacations because he thinks it's dumb (yet would jump at any offer to go out on vacation with his friends). At home, he's the laziest person I've ever met. He just lays in bed all day. His parents cook and clean for him and the only thing he is capable of doing and has interest in is homework. When he broke up with me, he wrote out a long-ass message almost instructing me how to cope with our breakup. It was the typical, \"hey I don't love you but we should be friends. Please take this time to talk with your friends. I'll do the same. Then we can talk again like normal in a week!\" And sure enough, he reaches out a week later to ask me how things are going.\n\nThe main reason we broke up was because I tried communicating to him about how he never seemed to prioritize me. Instead of talking it out, yep, he dumped me. He also admitted later that he was just stringing me along, I guess until he found another girl who he liked. That hurt a lot.\n\nI'm currently struggling with anxiety and depression after all this. I feel like he's a narcissist but I'm not sure and it's driving me nuts. I miss him but I hate him with a passion. I think he could be seeing someone else right now, I'm not sure. But I'm still hurting and it's been 5 months.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

A lot that I stayed blind too and a lot that I   didn\u2019t even realize was \u201cwrong\u201d. I definitely understand if you don\u2019t want to read it all BUT will be eternally grateful for the ones who do\ud83d\ude0a.\n\n\nI(F) was 18 and my S/O (M) was 20, when we first met and to say that it was \u201clove at first sight\u201d would be the understatement of the century, as I was IMMEDIATELY drawn to him, we\u2019ve literally been together EVER since and that was 15 yrs ago.\n\nFast forward about 6(ish) yrs into our marriage, we had 3 daughters by then and had bought our very first house. He worked grueling hours and I was a SAHM, I truly put him on a pedestal....I was just SO happy and SO in love with him.\n\nWhen we firs met, he was SO sweet, kind, generous and treated me like I was the \u201cbest thing since sliced bread\u201d. That\u2019s why I was SO confused and couldn\u2019t understand why in 2011, he started to verbally abuse me.\n\nHe would literally \u201cpick me apart\u201d point out what I was doing wrong, he would start arguments and I would ALWAYS be the one to go to HIM and apologize, he would degrade me in front of our daughters, he would shut me out/ignore me and right around then, is when I found out that he was having multiple online affairs. He swore he\u2019d stop, he begged and he pleaded for forgiveness and he did stop the cheating, but NOT the verbal abuse.\n\nBy the summer of 2012, I was literally a \u201cshell\u201d of the person I used to be....I was NO longer the \u201cattractive, bubbly, optimistic girl\u201d from before we met. Now, I was heavily medicated for anxiety and felt like I was the equivalent to the dirt on the bottom of his shoes....I felt worthless/hopeless and couldn\u2019t understand WHY he would be SO cold one minute and loving the next.....it was exhausting.\n\nBy 2013 things has improved a bit, BUT I caught him(yet again) having the sexually explicit online affairs. That time tho, I was pregnant and because of that-admittedly, I swept it under the rug.\nAFTER he apologized AGAIN and said that he had no desire  to continue doing it, I didn\u2019t ask anymore questions.....but I SHOULD have.\n\nIn 2016, I truly didn\u2019t feel as if he was cheating on me, BUT his behavior changed, when it came to being\u201dphysical) he would legitimately be kind to me, ONLY when he was \u201cgetting what he wanted\u201d and then it\u2019s like a light switch would go off and BOOM, he was back to his normal self by the very next morning.\n\nSince 2011, we\u2019ve had some good moments, some happy moments BUT he STILL treated me horribly most of the time. They say you can tell how a man will be towards you, by watching him with his own mother. Well......he is an ANGEL to his moms and he\u2019s NEVER been ANYTHING like that with me, so yeah....that\u2019s sometimes a false statement.\n\nOn April 8th 2019, after FIVE years of staying \u201cblind\u201d to all of it, I found out that he was having the online affairs AGAIN and it FINALLY broke me completely and it\u2019s because I literally thought about ALL of the shit I\u2019ve put up with over the years and how much I\u2019ve allowed myself to endure, for HIM.\n\nThe thing is, while he was busy all of these years with ALWAYS putting himself FIRST, I was busy as well....putting him FIRST. \n\nHis verbal abuse had gotten worse over the last 6 months, so I knew that something was up and BOY was I right. \nAfter I caught him, he confessed to having a addiction to porn/masturbation AND to gambling, on TOP of the online affairs. One of the worst parts is, he covered up his gambling by blaming ME for out financial issues(even tho I NEVER spent money). So, I spent YEARS believing that I was the problem, when it wasn\u2019t actually me at ALL.\n\nSo basically, he\u2019s spent the last 15 yrs, ONLY worrying about himself, NEVER considering ME, ONLY doing what satisfies HIM(because I require \u201cwork\u201d and it\u2019s easier to just jerk off), verbally abusing  me, (to the point of my having NO self-esteem). He\u2019s put women he doesn\u2019t even know OVER his own wife and for what? sex? I seriously did ANYTHING he wanted sexually, EVERY TIME he wanted it.\n\nIt\u2019s ALWAYS been about HIM and what truly kills my soul is that, he was willing to do ANYTHING ago keep his \u201csecrets\u201d even if it mean tearing me terribly and breaking me down.\n\nAfter TWO months, he finally admitted that its was SOLELY about sex(he told me it was emotional at first), TWO FREAKING MONTHS, fo fell me what I already freaking knew.\n\nHe gets WAY too dramatic when I\u2019ve asked him about certain things, he\u2019s distant when we are at \u201codds\u201d, he STILL hasn\u2019t come to me , when I get overwhelmed/upset with everything, because he\u2019s \u201cpast it all\u201d so automatically I should to as well. \nI\u2019ve also begged for him to bring up the conversation about everything (because I\u2019m way TOO anxious about bringing it up) and he\u2019s yet to do so.\n\nHe 150% thinks that he\u2019s doing WAY more than he\u2019s used too(when it comes to the kids and I) BUT he ONLY treats me well, when I\u2019m in a good mood......if not, he\u2019s STILL distant/cold. \nHe was all of the way \u201cshut off\u201d from emotions and he allowed himself, to remind himself how terrible I am, JUST so he could continue living this life.\n\nWhat he wanted he ALWAYS got and it didn\u2019t matter how I felt at all. Hell....he admitted that he NEVER considered me/my feelings. He says that he felt \u201crejected\u201d by me BUT I called bullshit on that because I threw myself at him and have ALWAYS been uplifting towards him.\n\nIt ALL boils down to him wanting to have sex with other women, because the porn wasn\u2019t \u201ccutting it anymore\u201d and I was NEVER an option(unless he didn\u2019t have any other options) so logically, he out up ads on affair sites and spent his nights telling strangers what he wanted to do to them and got off on reading what they wanted to do to him.\n\nI TRULY thought that we could work it all out BUT considering he knows ALL that he\u2019s done to me and he STILL can\u2019t bring himself to do the few things I\u2019ve asked of him- TRULY shows me that he will ALWAYS come first,(in his mind).\n\nI\u2019ve told him a MILLION times that when you TRULY love someone, it\u2019s EFFORTLESS. You  WANT to put them first, you WANT to think about their feelings and you WANT to be uplifting towards them. He has NEVER done any of that for me. \n\nI will NEVER EVER again spend SO much damn time asking myself \u201cwhat I did wrong\u201d for him to treat me so terribly. I can promise you that, IF I had a nickel for every time I asked him what I had done wrong(because his behavior would change SO drastically) I would never have to worry about money AGAIN. It\u2019s caused me to question EVERYTHING that I do because I am terrified of messing up/making someone upset with me.\n\nI\u2019ve spent the last 15 yrs(and almost half of my life) putting him first, walking on eggshells. Worrying about his feelings, being a \u201cbody\u201d for him to have sex with and allowing him to tear me down, little by little because, I TRULY thought that one day he would be different.\n\nI NOW see that, he never will and he\u2019s got his OWN ideas of how things went, or how he\u2019s treating me now,m and to him, he\u2019s doing \u201cenough\u201d. \nWell, I\u2019m sorry buddy BUT I\u2019m MORE that just \u201cenough\u201d and I\u2019ll NO longer accept ANY less the what I DESERVE.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The woman he convinced me for years was crazy, evil and out to get me. The woman I didn't speak to for three years in fear of upsetting him and hearing about how she was out to destroy me. The woman who really has always had my back, listened when we finally made contact, who has gone above and beyond to help, who saw through him the second she met him and who is my biggest advocate. \n\nIt was my mom who said yesterday \"if you or your siblings treated people the way he treats you and I knew it, I would cut your guts out. I would not stand for one of my kids acting like that or treating others like that. I would tear you a new asshole and have nothing more to do with you. I certainly NEVER would back you up. You would be done.\" Harsh? Yes but 100% honest from a woman with integrity who doesn't put up with shit.\n\nConversatiown turns to his family and how his mom, who has seen me with bruises on my face, saw him try to knock me unconscious in her home with a bottle, has heard the things he has said to me, knows I am basically imprisoned here and knew all about his cheating, keeps saying \"I hope you don't think the way he acts is a reflection on my parenting.\n\nIn the past, I have agreed with her, because I don't want to hurt her feeling and said no, even though I know it is a clear reflection of her parenting. All of her kids are vicious, abusive, grandiose, entitled narcs, so yeah it is certainly a reflection of her shitty parenting. \n\nNow, I have reached breaking point with her and the entire narc clan.

I'm willing to type it out now because it's getting extremely hard to bottle it up, and anonymity allows me to say everything without worrying about people in my life finding this post. I don't know how long this will be but I just want to finally let everything out.\nTW: Sexual and possible emotional abuse and child pornography\nFor context that somewhat matters to this story I am a 17 yr old girl that recently graduated high school.\nTo start, I was 14 yrs old when everything started happening. I was a freshman in a private school that never interacted much with boys. For most people they wouldn't focus too much on dating, but at my school that's pretty much what all us girls cared about. So the thought of boys not liking me destroyed me. At the time one of my friends reccomended that I go on kik and find a guy there. Looking back on it now it was a horrible idea, but at the time I saw how much attention she was getting from boys so I just followed whatever she advised. \nSo throughout the next few weeks I was on kik and talking to people on there. That's where the trouble started and while I met many creeps on there, one stuck out the most, TB. TB was an 18 yr old that I started talking to on kik. He seemed pretty socially awkward and he cheered me up whenever school stressed me out. He accepted me for who I was and that's what drawn me to him. As time passed I told him everything about me, how I was a virgin, how for some reason I never seemed to appeal to boys etc. He in turn replied that it was due to my looks. That \"immature boys my age\" wouldn't treat me well like an older man would. At the time my family was a more traditional christian household. So the church I went to taught us younger kids to date with the purpose of marriage and to never do anything sexual. So TB convincing me to do sexual things for him was disgusting but I was scared that he would hate me if I didn't do everything he said.\nI'm not gonna be specific but let's just say that the fucked up \"relationship\" between us lasted up to a year and some months. At the time I was also being groomed by other older men. I hated doing it but whenever I refused they would call me ugly,\n worthless and other things that would make me feel even worse, so I just went along with it to avoid confrontation. I felt worthless and most of my sexual experiences came from that, I didn't have a healthy first time experience with sex, it was forced upon me by all these men. These creeps that knew my age and would threaten to post pictures if I ever tried to refuse or tell. \nWhile it would seem bad to tell someone, I come from a state that will and has sentenced victims of child pornography as perpetrators themselves. Me being a girl that's in a catholic school didn't help matters either. \nEnter TF, a guy I met in church. He was 18 and a senior while I was only a sophmore. We quickly started dating and I stopped talking to the men on kik. The relationship we had quickly turned sour and TF quickly turned sexual. He was the first guy I had physically did anything with. He had a strange habit for choking which he did, too roughly. Months passed and after a family member of his died I went to his house to console him. \nWhen I went I was met with him trying to push up on me and his uncles calling me \"a very beautiful girlfriend\", and that \"I'll make a man happy one day\", ugh. He lured me to his bedroom in the basement under the pretense of him showing me his writing and he ended up forcing himself on me. He was physically bigger than me so he was able to lift me up and hold me down if I tried to run. When I struggled too much he grab my neck and squeezed. So hard that I felt my face tighten and I would just beg him to let me go. He did, after he forced me to do a few things and attempted to sodomize me. He kinda succeeded but failed due to my father calling me to tell me that he was on the way to pick me up from TF's house.\nHe reluctantly let me go and I went home after he proceeded to talk my dad about random shit while smirking directly at me the whole time. I didn't get a rape kit, hell I didn't tell my parents until a week later and I broke up with TB. I quickly started a long distance relationship with a dude hereby named L. \nL was a friend I had right before I was assualted by TF. When it happened and I told him in tears all he said was \"I told you so,\" since apparently he warned me that TF was going to rape me if I went to his house. This narcissistic gloating about how he knew everything continued throughout our year long relationship. I was beginning to have a deteriorating mental well-being. I began to hear different voices in my head, I never felt like myself and time would seemingly pass in a blink of an eye. \nL, get this, described that as me being a eldritch being that was destined to be with him, and I was just trying to get used to this. It's stupid, I know but I was so used to being called a whore that I just wanted to believe that I was more than what those men told me. So I went along with it and everything else. Him berating me because I was too scared to tell my parents about the groomers from kik. Him telling me that I was a bad older sister because I would sometimes have mental breakdowns around him. Him saying that every coping mechanism I had didn't work because he know what heals rape victims more than anything.\nOh yeah, one of the biggest things he would do throughout the relationship is whenever I was trying to heal and console in him about everything that happened to me, he would instead talk about how he was raped when was a toddler. Therefore, I didn't deserve to talk about how traumatized I was or that I wanted to commit suicide because the nightmares of it were too much. He would do this every time. He would make me feel like shit about everything he didn't like. And the worse thing is, he didn't seems like this at first. It was like a complete 180. He went from calling me beautiful and making me feel safe, to lying to my face about everything and making me feel awful about not going along with his sexual desires. \nOne day he told me that all the shit he told me about knowing the future, and that he was my soulmate, was all a complete lie. He was just willing to do anything for me to stay with him, and he felt like he could never admit it because I was too mentally weak to confront the truth. I broke up with him right then and there. He threatened suicide and I just told him that I can't heal myself if I have to walk on eggshells to appease him. \nAfter all that I came to the relization that I never was into being with men, was because I'm gay. So now I've been trying to heal and I'm planning to go to therapy and myself checked for any mental illnesses once I turn 18. L has been trying to come back into my life again but after I found out that he basically emotionally cheated on me throughout the entire relationship, I got off the phone and haven't talked to him since.\nTo this day I have an unhealthy relationship with myself. I desire and love girls. But I tie my self worth to my ability to look beautiful and please men, specifically older. Due to that, I blame myself for everything that happened since I was 14. I know that none of it was my fault, but I still hate myself for what happened. I don't care about being judged, or not being believed by anyone, since TF always find a way to talk to me to this very day. He tried to get into contact with my mother and father. He smirks at me whenever he sees me in public. He texts me whenever it's close to my birthday and asks if I \"finally forgave him since both the church and god did.\" So I don't care about anything anymore, I just want to finally be able to say that I am okay and mean it.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

We have a brother born halfway between us and a much younger brother. She has been in a relationship for almost ten years with this guy who is the same age as she is, and they have a little boy together who is the sweetest, smartest little thing and whom I love to pieces. \n\n\nMy sister\u2019s boyfriend has a good deal of qualities. He\u2019s intelligent, earns a huge amount of money, and has good taste in wine. He can also be a charming host and a good father. But he\u2019s a terrible, terrible boyfriend and always has been. \n\n\nMy sister does not have an education and hasn\u2019t worked in years. The last jobs she\u2019s had were poorly paid, backbreaking jobs\u2013sorting out potatoes, waitressing, McDonald\u2019s etc. She got her driver\u2019s license just a couple of years back. Before meeting this guy, she was having unstable housing for a while and suffered abuse at the hands of both men and drugs. My sister is an extremely kind, patient, understanding, lively and smart person but she is also virtually resource-less and petrified as a result of the terribly difficult conditions she has spent most of her adult life in. \n\n\nA few years back, my sister and her boyfriend moved into a house in the countryside to start a chestnut farm. Thankfully, it\u2019s a relatively easy and lucrative thing to do and although they aren\u2019t exploiting as much as they could, this activity plus the boyfriend\u2019s high paying job are enough to allow for a rather comfortable lifestyle. \n\n\nNow, the boyfriend is abusive. Abusive enough that someone in good health and resourceful would have run away years ago. I guess that I did not see the signs until after they had been together 4 years and did not feel legitimate to say anything then (which... is not an excuse, I know). Also, I did not have any experience with relationships and pretty much thought that abuse was normal. My parents are too apathetic to have noticed anything, I guess. My sister is not a battered woman *per se*, as they both insult and hit each other equally on a pretty regular basis, but his superior strength and economic/social status make her the victim 100%. Also, I\u2019ve witnessed their fights, and he starts them often as he\u2019s the one with bad character. \n\n\nSo, my brother and I have recently been starting to tell her about breaking up with him. I\u2019ve told her we could move in together in the city I live in and in which she could easily find a job. My brother told her she could move in with him just to be safe for some time. Options exist but she\u2019s scared of her boyfriend getting full custody of their child because of his comfortable situation. \n\n\nNow... my sister is officially a farmer, meaning she took an exam plus went through some other procedures to get the much needed status. However, she does not officially has a business and couldn\u2019t survive on her own and pay back her loans at the same time. If she were to leave, she\u2019d have to find a minimum wage job, or live on benefits, or be hosted by family, or by an refuge...\n\n\nI think it\u2019s doable. I truly think the only solution is to move out &amp; sadly leave their nice farm and area &amp; get support from her family to build a life as a single mother. Anything but abuse is great. And I believe she has some chances to get full custody eventually if she stabilises (which she can) and has good defense (which she can, too; we know lawyers and my mom knows about those things as she works for child protection services). \n\n\nWhat do you guys think? Please give your best advice and most sincere opinion.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He is a \u201chighly intelligent\u201d covert narc/sociopath/what ever with a great job and many worshipping followers. And these are the types of things he does and says. Lol. \n\nOnce you see it you just can\u2019t unsee it.

It\u2019s like he was TRYING to act like a little goblin. He would Say something nasty or confusing- peep my face for a reaction and, skip off into the woods. That\u2019s freaking hilarious. Who actually does that!? Him. He actually does that. The forest goblin apparently. \n\nPoint is trust me- you will see them VERY differently when you are able to open the curtain behind the mask of the \u201cgreat and powerful OZ!\u201d There\u2019s just a little old dude in there pulling a bunch of levers frantically and being a little brat for NO REASON. \n\nSo please help me demystify these people who we give way too much power.

I don't think it was right of me to drag things out and avoid speaking the truth, so I'm partly to blame for how the situation unfolded. \n\nI met her in January of 2018 through a friend finding app, and at first things were really great. In hindsight, there were definite red flags that I should have seen (shoulda coulda woulda!). For example, she would often come across as very arrogant or as a know-it-all, and would talk down constantly about her coworkers. Everyone around her was \u201cincompetent,\u201d she knew what was best, etc. I felt that I should just accept that as part of her personality since I feel I'm sometimes too picky about my friends, so I let it slide. Would not recommend!  \n \n\nAnother red flag was that we very quickly went from barely knowing each other to hanging out once a week. She would get me to schedule in the next week's hangout with her while we were still hanging out. It was weird, I would just get tongue-tied and agree to the friendship on her terms, even when I didn't necessarily have the time to see her. I'd just agree and make time. Things started getting too intense for me. She was always baking me something or coming up with all these ideas for outings for us to do together, which sounds so nice on paper. But there was this feeling of pressure, that I needed to reciprocate or come up with something equally great all the time. I started feeling drained. Most of my friendships are more laid-back: we might grab a bite, go for a walk, or just watch movies at home. Things subtly began feeling like a sort of competition with her, but I didn\u2019t notice it until I was 6 or 8 months in. If I mentioned doing something with another friend, she would blank me or change the subject. I felt that she low-key wanted to have control over my schedule, who I was seeing, etc. She would make little digs at me and then claim to be \u201cjust joking.\u201d I mentioned I was 7 months sober, which I was very proud of, and she sarcastically referred to my \u201cstraight edge\u201d lifestyle. She would get into debates with me about topics that she knew were close to my heart, nothing was off limits for her. And she could never accept that it was possible I could know more about a topic than her.\n\nI wish I just brought up at the time that her comments were hurtful. I wish I called her out more often on her bullshit. Instead, I thought that maybe just seeing her a little less often would be helpful, that I could get some distance and bring some balance back to the relationship. I assumed maybe she\u2019d be a little disappointed, but that she would ultimately accept it. I used the excuse of being busier after work (which was true, I\u2019d picked up more responsibilities in terms of hobbies/volunteering). She totally freaked. Started love bombing and sending me links to fun things to do together, and then when that didn\u2019t work she\u2019d sort of sulk and disappear for a while. It would alternate between the two. I tried to keep consistent, messaging, but not always being the initiator, saying yes to hangouts sometimes but not every time. The first time I saw her after I started this process she looked so uncomfortable and went on about if she did anything wrong to let her know and how it had been so long since we\u2019d seen each other (it had been 2 or 3 weeks). The whole thing just felt off, like she was trying to get info about what I was up to. I wish I was honest with her then. But I had no clue what to say. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you and don\u2019t like your personality?\u201d It felt like I was in too deep.\n\nShe would tell me stories about really controlling things she would do to family members or her husband. The alarm bells kept growing louder and louder as she would slowly reveal these things to me. I started feeling a little afraid of her. Our conversations felt more like recon on her end than genuine sharing. Everything she told me was meant to impress me, or to get attention. I felt like she was always watching my every move, it was very disconcerting. The less we hung out, the less I wanted to hang out, and the more I started noticing odd or disturbing behaviour on her part. She\u2019d alternate between no contact for a week or more followed by a sudden message full of memes, asking to hang out, what I was up to, etc. It broke my heart, I honestly felt awful dragging the situation out. I finally realized this wasn\u2019t someone I even wanted in my life as an acquaintance. I sent her a message last night, and was tactful (I hope), but honest. I told her that when she tells me about keeping tabs on her other friends, etc, it makes me feel like I can\u2019t trust her. That I don\u2019t feel our personalities are a good fit. I was finally honest with her, which I should have done long, long ago. I hope this is the end of it. I don\u2019t feel angry at her, I feel sad for her, and guilty that I didn\u2019t handle the situation better. I wish her peace; I hope she gets help for herself. But I know that life is too short to fill it with people who are negative, controlling, and manipulative. Things are hard enough as it is. I have so many wonderful friends who support and encourage me, and there\u2019s no time to waste on draining relationships. If you\u2019re in the middle of this type of friendship, I beg you to be honest with yourself, and with the other person (if it\u2019s safe), and remove yourself as soon as possible. Half measures simply don\u2019t work with these people.\n\nPeace and love to everyone struggling.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Bad as ever?\" or \"When are you gonna move out?\" followed by something about wanting him to leave. He used to be really insecure about his grades. I'd usually leave him alone, and he left me alone, unless we had to talk. He'd usually protect me too. I remember, she tried to throw me down the basement (long story), and he legit started fighting her.

She used to constantly insult us, hit us for no reason, belittle us, gaslight us, etc etc. My experiences with her were tame (when he was still here) in contrast to his. She used to pick him up and threaten to throw him into the fireplace when he was 8 or so. Used to cut him with a knife, he's got scars all over his fingers. We all have scars, it's like a family mark. Even my oldest brother (whom my mother loves) has one. Just one, a small one. I have a giant one, goes from the start of my left ring finger to my wrist (the knob part). \n\nSo, enfin, Kevin is like 1.5 years older (he's supposed to be 18) than me, and he ran away about 2-3 years ago.

My mother was functional but had sever psychiatric issues and was often not in a relationship. I was often alone, without anyone to communicate with or a male role model. She would rely heavily on gaslighting for dealing with unpleasant memories. I tried to listen to what she ask of me. However often she would forget what was said on monday by friday and I would be in trouble. she would try to make up for mistakes by buying me things.\n\nmy ealiest memories are very nice living with mothers family around. However my mother was single and we ended up living with her friends and just us sometimes. around 3 I was still diapers and I remember a fear of of my mother. maybe around the same time I remember being yelled at until I was breaking my things, hitting and biting myself. I couldnt get the yelling to stop. Yelling and hitting were regular methods of communication. \n\nA little later I was 4 or 5, I had my first sexual encounter with 2 sisters older than me, maybe 8ish. I believe sometime after that was raped by a man, my mother was aware. My childhood ended being very sexual for awhile. growing up my mother would make comments about me being gay, I am not. \n\nBy the time I was 10 my child had a few years of no sexual contact and I was healing.  One night my younger sister said her friend was playing games with her brother in the shower and asked me if I would play those games with her. I said no, the thought had never crosssed my mind. I was a good brother. After a moment of my sister talking with our mother, I was told that there was nothing wrong with doing what my sister wanted and I had better go do it now. It was at this moment my life was ruined, all trust and faith was gone. My ability to say what happened to my body no longer existed in that house. The beatings hense forth would become much worse. I became isolated, suicidal, and very depressed. My sister brew up repeatedly trying to touch and nothing was allowed to be talked about. I was blamed for everything even though I said no. \n\nwithin a few months I tried writing a letter to my mother and left on the table while I left the house for a bit, I needed space. I tried to explain what happened to her and asked her to listen more to me. The note was thrown away, I was severly beaten and kicked out of the house. Within a few hours she found me and yelled at me for running away. This pattern of blame, kicking me out, and pulling me backin lasted for a very long time.\n\nIn came the cops, counselors, and psychiatrists. they tended to listen to my mother who tended to cover her ass. No one cared about the bruises, my side, or that I did my best as I was a bad child. I once got arrested for grabbing her hands while she was hitting me. I was constantly told I was lying. To get her way, she would start a fight over something miner, yell till I exploded, then called the cops to have me arrested. \n\nI spent sometime in mental institutions. during one of my stays a counselor started to listen, so my mom had the counselor prevented from dealing with me. But others still listened, and for once I was taken off meds and allowed to be myself. Though I still went home and all the progess was destroyed. \n\nI have never adjusted well, I cant hold a job. I keep asking for help and no one will. I dont know what to do. I think my sister molested my daughter because noone every told her its wrong. my daughter intern was told by my mother those things were ok. When I see my sister she still tries to touch me. Fuck I just wish this wont get down voted and somebody maybe can atleast listen. I am not the monster in the story....", "subreddit": "abuse"}

(Advice Please)", "author": "bite_sized_lilz", "self_text": "J=Him\nA=His GF\n\n\n\n\nMy best friend has been in a minipulative relationship for almost a whole year. He was the same old him at first and we were still talking on a regular basis like always. But as time went on he stopped talking to me all together. And he recently kinda started talking to me after a big fight they had a month and a half ago but still is really weird. I have tried talking to him but idk if I did it in the correct way. \n\nBack Story:\n\nSo J met A around mid July of last summer. J just got out of a wobble relationship with one of my childhood friends. They were talking for a little bit before they started dating but not that long. They even had sex before they started dating which ik it can be love bombing which is typically used by narcissists. Also before they were even dating A was already treating him weird and I told J it wasn't a good idea. But of course J went through with it anyways. Fast forward to March of 2019 J had a friend staying with him and A was also living with him. A apparently did something with Js friend when J went to sleep because J didn't feel good that night. Js other friend was there and would tell J what happened. So J met me after school to talk to me. J told me that before he left that A accused J of going to meet me to have sex with me. This would never happen we are like brother and sister. This ended up in them being separated for a couple of days. J told A he wanted to talk about what happened but A wouldn't do it. But A then asked J to have sex and when J said no A got mad and blocked J. A few days later J and A talked and also got back together. It turned out that A ended up kissing Js friend. A had the excuse she gets horny while drunk but I'm calling bs on that. Fast forward a month later and they have this big fight at his house bc A started talking shit about Js new friend that was living at the house. Which led to J telling the friend what A said. This got A mad which led to her saying a bunch of shit. Most importantly A bragged about still cheating on J with the previous friend that was living there. Then it got physical A tried to push herself up against J so he lightly pushed A back. A ended up punching J then taking the Xbox J bought her then storming out of his house. They again were broken up for a couple of days again. We were talking again during this period of time before they again got back together. J would not talk to me again until I talked to him about my worries about the relationship he was in. J said A never kept cheating on him A said that just to hurt him bc she was angry. I seriously doubt it was a lie bc J said A was being weird with her phone leading up to this. The final major incident is when we started playing Xbox together sometimes bc J couldn't play if A was around. A said she was going to her moms in order to visit her autistic cousin the hospital. J asked if A wanted him to go for support. A said no so J decided to play Xbox with me and a few of our friends. A's little sister was in our party talking to us and A decides to get on the mic and snapped about who's in the party then J tells her who's in the party. A automaticly starts acting nice as soon as she hears my name. I'm really close to J's mom and A knows this. A was also drunk while in the mic and told J she was coming home in a bit. A also never went to see her cousin in the hospital. It's now 2 in the morning and we are still playing when J gets a call from A. A starts going off about how J is a asshole bc hes playing with his best friend (aka me) instead of texting her while her cousin was in the hospital. J said I asked if you wanted me to come and you said no and you never even went to see your cousin. J also said that A is allowed to hang out with her friends on the weekend so why can't he. A then called J a douche bag. A was also drunk when this happened. \n\nA also controls who J hangs out with and when. \n\nA makes J delete Facebook post she doesn't like (he never said that but it suddenly started happening when they got together) \n\nA also made J remove all girls on social media and his phone the only one J wouldn't remove was me. But A can still have guy friends on everything. \n\nA won't even talk to J's friends in Xbox Live parties even in team communication critical games. Plus I can't even join the party if she's playing. \n\nIf we try to point out what A is doing A will make herself look like the victim in J's eyes. \n\nI also asked him if he was ok the other day on Instagram and he asked me to unsend the massages and when I asked why he wouldn't tell me. \n\nUpdate 1:A accused J of cheating over a hair tie that he found. Then when i came over to see if it was mine. A asked J why i was over there all of a sudden. A also started a agrument with j blaming him for her losing in a game. A also tried to get me and j personal friend kicked from the online party for no reason.\n\nHow do I get my friend out of this?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I for whatever reason, am extremely sensitive. I hate failing people I hate disappointing people I hate conflict. Sometimes I feel like everything is dialed up with it come sto emotions for better or for worse. I\u2019ve never felt out of control I just..I feel haha. Which makes me if I may say a very loving and empathetic person...and also sometimes I feel it makes me weak. \nSo my question is \nMy roommate who, thankfully is moving out in 12 days, just... i can\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. \nHalf of the time she\u2019s extremely nice and friendly. Half of the time I feel like we are actually friends we have a relationship and I can trust her.  Half of the time she reaches out to me always talking about stuff going on in her life and her thoughts and...never really asks me in return but half of the time it really is really good! \nUnless I mess up. And granted I did mess up. Once I left the key in the apt door. Not the door outside but the one to out soecific apt. And like that was my mistake! 100% and I owned it. I felt pretty stupid and said sorry and it hasnt been an issue since. But at the time when my roommate found out....it was a level of anger that didn\u2019t seem to make sense. I always will respect how someone feels in a situation because that\u2019s just how they feel. But I also strongly believe that there is a good and bad way to deal with conflict and that you can address an issue with out tearing a period apart \n\nBut she tore me apart and I just... it sucked. Can\u2019t even really put words into it. The amount that it hurt felt silly. Like I am the weirdo for being so upset. It\u2019s my fault. \n\nThis is one example but there are many others. She will be fine and happy and then blow up out of no where. Over small things like the dishes or something random. And she will go full on \u201cthis is unacceptable\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s no excuse for this\u201d. She will be funny and laughing and chatty and then not speak to me for a week. I never know that\u2019s coming next and it scares me!! She once told me that she just didn\u2019t understand me (and my mental health) and later she realized that was wrong of her but she.. idk. She doesn\u2019t take it well when I calmly and politely say something about something that she\u2019s done (like putting the wrong kind of soap in the dish washer )....once I had a panic attack so bad I was stuck on the floor under my desk. When she heard me sobbing she just...went into her room. Claiming later it she thought it was better for me to be alone....\n\nShe\u2019s never once asked me what I feel is best \n\nShe\u2019s moving soon. I\u2019m moving on. But I feel like somehow all of this is my fault. Surely it must be. Cuz if she\u2019s just \u201cbeing honest\u201d then it can\u2019t be mean right? If she\u2019s just \u201ctelling the truth\u201d then it must be my fault. If she has all these excuses and reasons for being the way she is then I\u2019m the one who\u2019s wrong right? \n \nCan someone be toxic with out even meaning too? \nAm I just too sensitive? \n\n... is this abuse?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

when you do \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ instead it messes this up\". he always says it like its a lecture about something that should be obvious. like hell talk really slowly and go super in depth into a issue tha t wouldve been solved with a few sentan ces.\n\ni cant think of many specific instances when he was really really bad,  but there are two similar ones that come to mind. when i was maybe 9/10-ish i had a friend over and we were watching youtube on the computer in my parents room. i clicked on a video to show my friend that had cursing in it (i either didnt know or didnt think it was that bad) and once my dad heard it he started yelling at me repeatedly to turn it off. i dont remember this very well but i just remember crying and saying \"i cant\" because he scared me so much i couldnt turn it off very fast because my handss were shaking.\n\nthe other one was much more recently, when something similar happened with my brother. background info: he has some developmental issues and problems controlling his anger. hes gotten much better at it but he still has moments where he cant walk away from something and ends up getting a litle violent. hes playing a game and got frustrated, was most likely about to start banging on the keyboard or somthing, and my dadd started screaming at him to walk away and leave it alone. i was in the room next to them so i didnt see everything,  but i saw my brother walk past the door on the way to his roo  m and my dad followed him. my brother slammed the door and my dad opened it and slammed it harder (which actually broke it lol)  by this point i was trying to get as vfar away from him as i could, but to get to m y room you have to pass through my brothers room, so that way was blocked. i ended up running downstairs and had my sister comfort me, and eve n though i couldnt exactaly hear, my dad was definately still yelling at my brother upstairs. he lter apologize d but honestly it felt very lackluster and he promised to \"try and do bettr\" but he has yet to actually improve upon anything\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nim really sorry this is so long, i just really need a second opinion. also please understand that this is probably skewed in my favor and i might be unintentionally exaggerating or only pointing out the bad thjngs\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: i know i just posted but i forgot something. while hes never been actively violent he has threatened violence or been  mean to our pets , which makes me scared because if hes willing to do it to them why not me? i cant remember the wording but when i was younger h e was mad at our cat and said something about drop kicking him. we also recently got a dog and hes trying to train her but his patience is really bad and he keeps getting angry and yellng at her and calling her names .  hes never really yelled at any of our animals but he ver y frequently calls them names . not in a loving manner either (ill call them idiots sometimes but its never with bad intentions) , i t always feels like a genuine dislike", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I was 15 and was afraid to lose him because I was moving away (seriously flawed thinking, I know). I loved him, but had he not pressed the issue I'd have stayed a virgin. But I made the big decision and gave in. During the act, he says to me \"don't I have something that belongs to you?\". Now, I'm a 15 year old girl, scared that I'm having sex (which was a bit painful) and confused about what he's talking about. He's looking at me when he says this, and has this Cheshire grin on his face. I'm just wanting to be cared for and protected, so I search my mind trying to figure out how his question pertains to the act of making love. When I don't answer he responds \"your virginity\". In a flash I feel embarrassed, mortified, regretful, ashamed, and awful. Yet all I could do was nervously giggle as he hovered over me. I felt scared. After that, we never had sex again but continued dating for the short time left in the school year. Then I moved away. After I left, he told everyone that he could that he'd \"done it\" with me....and this was a small town, so reputation was important. I was humiliated and just completely hurt. I was the talk of the school (and I hadn't told anyone - not even my best friend).\n\nFast forward 30 years, and he contacts me on social media to apologize for not being a good friend to me. So I told him exactly how he made me feel and how it really messed with my head and (I think) caused a domino effect of bad relationships in my adulthood. I just never felt like a guy wasn't just trying to nail me. No guy would ever not hurt me. So anyway, he apologizes, and is very good at saying all the right things. We start a friendship online that, regretfully, progresses to an online emotional affair. He tell me things like \"you are so strong, so beautiful, such a good person\" he praises me for starting my own business, tells me how proud I should be helping people, and basically starts bemoaning on what could have been, using the word \"transparent\" to explain his feelings. He listens to everything I say with zero criticism.  \n\nThis part I am deeply ashamed of: we are both married to other people. I would try to set a boundary, only to give in when he'd get depressed about me asking to stop talking intimately. And because I was going through a very rough patch in my marriage, I gave in. This was until his wife found out. Never in my life have I been more sorry and awakened to my complete wrongness in the whole scenario. I apologized. I sought a counselor/therapist, and I confessed my sin to a priest. Both the therapist and priest suggested that I NOT tell my husband about the online relationship because it was obvious that I was repentant and didn't want to hurt him now that everything ended with the online relationship (the old boyfriend basically told me he could no longer talk to me, and I agreed). \n\nFor three months, life went back to normal and I decided that living with the knowledge of my sin would forever hurt me, but thankfully not my husband (even though I wanted to tell him). Then one day the old boyfriend contacts me....calling and leaving messages and texts. At first he's kind and reaching out. But I am firm in my decision to repent and never allow boundaries to be crossed again so I ignore him. After a week, he becomes beligerant. He leaves horrible messages telling me how weak I am, calls me a pathetic loser who always plays the victim, tells me I'll never be half the woman his wife is, and that he's made over a million dollars and would have given me the world. He tells me I'm a bad person and that he's sorry he ever met me. Through everything, I didn't respond except on the final day, texted to tell him that I was sorry he felt that way but that there was no way possible to reconnect due to our spouses feelings and that I wished him a happy life and all the best. I was kind despite how mean he got. I felt strong and righteous finally in putting that boundary up.\n\nThe next day, he wrote to my husband and told him everything. It ruined so much of myself. I was betrayed, yet I had also betrayed my husband. I own my responsibility in this mess and thankfully my husband has forgiven me and we are working on our marriage. But for some reason, I cannot shake this fear I have of being \"fucked\" by that ex twice in my life....and so far apart. I worry about revenge or retaliation. And mostly, I just second guess everything because all it took was someone pretending to be into me only for their own benefit. Looking back, I always had to do what he wanted or else I'd pay for it somehow. I chose to push that thought down all the time. So basically, this is a story of what not to do....of how not to be. Find your strength ladies and hold onto it. Your questioning thoughts are valid and no one should gaslight you, patronize you or coerce you otherwise. Take it from me.... I almost let this person destroy my life because I couldn't think for myself. I'll never stop regretting it. I never understood narcicism until I re-met this person. Some lessons are truly rough.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

None of them felt like this deep sense of security and inner peace I had with him.

{"post_id": "c2enyo", "created_utc": 1560934555, "title": "Urgent advice needed - TW", "author": "HiddenForttress", "self_text": "Hello everyone. I've been following this subreddit for about a month or so, and I created my own account about a week ago because I felt things ramping up with my N, and I didn't think I'd get to this point so quickly but it looks like tonight was the night everything went to pieces.\n\nI'll start by just summarizing what happened this evening. I don't know where to go from here.\n\nSo today after work my N (21f) and I (20m) were driving around town running some errands. For dinner, she wanted to go to one fast food store, but I got it confused with another and started driving in the wrong direction. When she finally revealed to me that I had been going the wrong way the whole time, she said I was such an idiot and that this moment was indicative of \"how stupid\" I am. I said I just made a simple mistake, and started chuckling at how outsized and aggressive her reaction was. \n\nMy laugh, however, made things worse, as she immediately grabbed my arm and dug her nails into my skin. Then she punched my arm. I told her that that was unacceptable\u2014the scratching and the hitting. She replied that she never hit me. I was like \"huh?\" you totally just did, and then she gave me the silent treatment. So I'm not sure if she really doesn't think she hit me or if she was just trying to cover her tracks.\n\nEventually we got back to her house. She told me not to come inside (but I've been conditioned to come inside anyway to prove my devotion) and when I went inside I found her slicing some oranges with a large butcher knife next to her father. The moment I walked in, she gestured into the other room with the knife and we left the kitchen. She kept using the knife to point at me then at the door, saying \"get out.\" At this point, I know I should've listened, but I was so upset that things had finally come to the knife (she's never used a weapon during our arguments, ever), that I kept pleading with her to set the knife down. She refused, and after she made one motion too fast (not directed at me, I think) and I flinched, I became super uncomfortable and removed myself from the situation, driving away.\n\nAs usual, within a few minutes, she called me and asked if I'd come back. Since I'm desperate and want this relationship to either magically improve or just end\u2014and I suspected I was clearly on the right side of this knife disagreement\u2014I came back, even though she promised to have the knife nearby when we were on the phone.\n\nThe moment I walk back in, she pulls a larger knife out of the rack, sits down at the couch, and gestures to me to join. I said no, that's ridiculous, and that she had to put the thing away, now. She said I was in no position to make demands, to which I replied that knives and other forms of violence are non-starters, and that I wouldn't spend any time with her if she was just gonna hold the knife.\n\nShe was so upset when I told her I'm not gonna deal with the knife that she grabbed my arm and yanked me into her own room, where she threw me on the bed and proceeded to scratch, hit and punch me. She'd get on top of me and spit on me and put her face scarily close to mine, yelling about the thin ice I'm on and how I shouldn't make demands. It was so sad because usually in even the worst arguments I still see that person I loved, but it was all gone today. Nothing redeemable, during this part of the day at least.\n\nShe said I've treated her so horribly in the past that I don't have a right to make demands. Since I'm on such thin ice with her, I should be begging to spend time with her even at knifepoint. (Related issue: when I initially confronted her about pulling the knife on me, she said it was already out to slice watermelon, and that she only used it during that initial confrontation because it had been in her hand at the time, so she claimed she didn't \"pull\" or \"brandish\" anything at me when I accused her since she hadn't pulled it out specifically for me. When I returned, she also made a fake throwing motion with it that nearly made me jump out of the chair. I was so sad). I said that asking for no knife is not a ridiculous \"demand,\" and she got closer into my face, seething.\n\nEventually she started telling me \"Look, you have two options, either go home and never see me again or deal with the knife. Finally standing up for myself and feeling annoyed by the situation being boiled down to just 2 choices, I sat upright (after laying down) and told her \"No. Those are not my options.\"\n\nEnraged, she grabbed a half of a watermelon she had been eating and raised her hand to throw it and strike me in the head. I grabbed her hands before she could do this though, and threw the watermelon at the wall out of her reach. Before the fruit even hit the wall, though, my gf's fist hit my eyeball, causing my vision to go white for 1-2 seconds and a whole half of my head to throb (as it still does several hours.\n\nEverything changed. I almost threw up. That punch was an epiphany moment for all of us. The argument about whether I should stay and suffer abuse or leave and never see her again had answered itself. For the first time in a long time, she apologized, started crying, and came beside me to take care of me. She went from saying \"I'll never apologize\" and \"I have no sympathy,\" to giving me a heartfelt \"I'm sorry.\" She even admitted that\u2014physically\u2014 she knows she's been expressing herself horribly, and that she knew it's been bad but hasn't known how to change it. I was so thankful to see this side of her, but the conversation had shifted\u2014these were our final moments together. She rounded up the stuff I'd gotten her over the years into a cardboard box and told me to take it when I leave. Then she gave me some ice for my wounds, and we watched Internet videos like the good old days. We were both crying a bit, and telling each other how much we loved each other.\n\nShe started saying some really painful things about how hard it is \"letting go\" but that it feels good. That got to me.\n\nThen, as I prepared to leave. She kinda stopped saying \"I love you,\" and I sensed something was wrong, and I asked what I could do. She said, \"you know what I want,\" which I thought I did: stuff like a \"real\" man with an apartment and no attachments to anybody so he can focus all his attention on her. She said these answers were wrong.\n\nShe said all she wanted was family.\n\nThis was such a sucker punch. I felt so horrible and guilty.\n\nHer family is dysfunctional (they basically communicate through post-it-notes) and not affectionate at all. For the past 5-6 years, I've filled that role in her life. I gave her hope, and this explains her hatred of my family, who she complains about so much because I try to spend time with them on holidays and such and thus they \"take away from her.\" But this comment really made me sad because it showed all the hopes she's put into me and how I've really let her down.\n\nAs I iced my puffy eyeball, she literally started railing into me again about how this is all my fault. How I can't be in her family if I'm also a part of my original family. How she won't talk to me unless I move out within the week (and cut off all contact with my family, quit school, get a job, find a way to pay for insurance and my own car). Suddenly all the stuff we just shared with a sense of finality had been replaced by the same old, same old (at least our same old). She told me she has no sympathy for me, and then she talked about how she doesn't feel things for me. She only sees me for what I provide to her\u2014which, according to her, is nothing right now. I felt like dirt, and I wanted to just leave, but I also wanted closure.\n\nShe wouldn't say anything with a sense of finality, just silent treatment whenever I tried to exit, so I just waited and bided my time. Eventually, as she readied herself for bed (with my help), she became more open to me, letting me give her a hug, tuck her into bed, say goodnight and turn out her lights before heading home. I love taking care of her like this. It was like turning the lights out on our relationship, and I broke down thinking about how it might very well be my last time walking on the gravel path up to her house, the same gravel path that had been so happy and exciting 5 years ago.\n\nToday really just sucked, and after the big punch I thought it was done for good, but the 3 hours of arguing/discussions afterward make me wonder what to expect next or how to handle it. She did say \"don't expect communication from me anytime soon.\" I know I want a happy, N-free life, but this is so sad already. I miss my best friend.\n\nSo that's basically where I'm at right now. Any advice/feedback would be very helpful. I'm worried about what tomorrow will bring. Also, I'm happy to add any more details if people have questions.\n\ntl;dr my N gf and I, after months of intense arguing over me moving out, finally reached a breaking point today. She was physically violent, so I put my foot down, prompting her to punch me in the face. Immediately afterward, it seemed as if we both acknowledged we couldn't move forward. But then, after hours of arguing, these positions changed, and now I'm worried about what to expect next.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I also apologize in advance if there are any errors because I am writing this at 3 am haha. \n\nShort backstory: My biological father was verbally + emotionally abusive towards my mother, sister, and I. However, I can forgive him somewhat because his behavior was a result of PTSD after serving in combat (Plus, the last time I talked to him proved that he has been trying to better himself and that he wants a relationship with my sister and I. But understandably so, my mother won\u2019t allow this to happen). \n\nAnyways, what I\u2019m trying to get at here is that I (sadly) had prior experiences with abuse, but I can\u2019t help but feel that I am overreacting to situations that occurred with my former \u2018stepdad\u2019 (I\u2019m going to call him Tom in the rest of this post). \n\nI met Tom (him and my mom never got married but he was in my life for a long time + they were engaged) when I was in first grade. He was very normal and nice but I was weary of him. As time went on, some situations occurred that I\u2019m struggling to determine if they were some sort of abuse or not. Some examples are:\n\n1) He would always lecture me about my \u2018attitude problem.\u2019 Of course, I was young and I could be a brat like any other kid, but the issue was that he would always bring it up when I hadn\u2019t even done anything. I remember one instance where my sister and I were getting along incredibly well (we used to fight a lot which resulted in us getting in trouble lol) and he pulled me aside before I went to bed. He started this long lecture about this attitude problem he saw in me and he simply told me that people like me would never be successful in life. I was crushed but confused why he was bringing up at that moment (my sister overheard his talk with me too and she thought it was wrong of him). Another time, I went bowling with Tom, my mom, my sister, and a couple of other relatives. We were getting ready to pay for everything and Tom asked if I wanted to bowl too. I politely declined because I wanted to sketch instead. Well, to my embarrassment, he pulled me aside in front of everyone while they were beginning to bowl and started to give me a long lecture about my \u2018attitude\u2019 again. I felt ashamed even though I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong. These two instances are all I can remember in enough detail to explain, but he lectured me more times on my attitude at weird times. What made it worse he would try to excuse his mean lectures as a gesture of his concern because he claimed that he thought of my sister and I as his own kids. Additionally, he would frequently tell my sister and I to shut up when we laughed which I don\u2019t really understand at all. I don\u2019t know if all this is manipulation or what?\n\n2) He would insult me often, mostly regarding my physical appearance. I was a very skinny child before I hit puberty and I was super self conscious about it (other girls at school would occasionally give me a rough time about it too). He would tell me things like that I was just \u2018skin and bones\u2019 and that I needed to gain weight. He also told me I was ugly numerous times. He made rude comments about other things too, but my appearance was a recurring theme. This isn\u2019t awful compared to what others have gone through but I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t normal parenting behavior, right? Maybe it\u2019s stupid of me to ask that but I never had a real father figure so I honestly don\u2019t know if this is normal. \n\n3) Tom would interact with me physically in ways that made me uncomfortable. For clarification, this physical stuff started when I was in like fourth or fifth grade and it ended when I was in seventh because Tom and my mom soon split. So, he would force me to \u2018wrestle\u2019 with him, aka him getting on top, pinning me down, and play fighting. He would always do it at random times and I would beg him to stop because I never consented to it. I began to defend myself as I got older because it just felt more and more inappropriate. However, he would get offended when I would fight back and he would say things like \u201cC\u2019mon, I thought we were just playing.\u201d Other times, he would basically pin me down and tickle torture my armpits. It never tickled through, it just hurt, and I when would ask him to stop, he would just start doing it more intensely. He would also force me to cuddle with him by simply stating, \u201cbiglongnow_, let\u2019s cuddle!\u201d I would say no and he would cling to me anyways (one time he fell asleep on me and I was forced to just remain there). Sometimes, if he was near me when I was sitting on the couch and I got up, he would spank me. Not in a punishing way, but like the way a boyfriend would playfully spank his girlfriend. If I\u2019m being honest, as I got older, I began to fear that he would violate me sexually at some point. Luckily, my mom and Tom split before anything else could happen. I realize the physical stuff is probably the most disturbing out of all the things he did to me, but I don\u2019t know what it would be classified as? If someone could give me a name for the physical stuff specifically, I would be of great help to me in order to understand my situation better. \n\nYears of going through all of this led to bad effects on me, such as fear of being touched (I used to panic if anyone touched me.

When we returned to his house, in the early evening I had a single can of beer with me that I had been looking forward to drinking. I had 1 sip of that beer and sat it down on the table at his place and left the room to go to the bathroom, when I came back, the drink was where I had left it, but I can't explain it I just felt like something had been done to it, I swallowed my gut feeling and continued just doing normal things and took a second sip of the beer but I started to feel - weird. Like the back of my mouth slowely tightening and like I was severely feeling a surge of alcohol - but I had only had two/maximum three sips of it. While this was happening and my thoughts started jumping around askind myself what is wrong with my body I started to feel really tired, so I put the beer aside and wrapped up in a blanket on his couch, thinking \"what is wrong with me?\" He joined me and carried the beer saying \"don't forget your beer\" while smiling and kind of cuddling me. I felt weird and faint. He \"empathized\" by asking if I'm alright, I said, no, not really. But at this point I almost felt sure that something had happened to the beer. I could feel the side of my face kind of twitching ( I know this sounds horrible but I can't help it - this is what happened and I am still severely confused by it all) and I remember looking at the beer while thinking \"that beer is full, I had a maximum of 3 sips how can I be feeling like that?\" And at that point he asked me if he could have a sip of my beer. I said yes - he drank a sip of it - but didn't put it to his lips, just poured it out of the air into his mouth. I kind of felt like I was crazy at this point, thinking that my partner tampered with my beer - however I did not continue drinking it and neither did he. He wanted me to stay the night, I really did not want to at all, so I said that I feel tired and want to be alone, and I left. This is the next day and I feel like I made a horrible job at explaining this situation, but I just feel unsafe or that I may be losing my mind. \n\nCan someody relate to this ?

My mom would make dinner for the two of them,and I couldn't even have the leftovers because \"well maybe he wants to eat that.\" I couldn't make my dinner whenever the two of them were in the kitchen. They would stop their conversation as soon as I entered the room, like I really cared about what they were talking about. He would become very annoyed if I made something while they were eating in the kitchen, and didn't even attempt to make conversation with me. Sometimes, he would just get up and leave the table. Like I was some horrible figure to look at, I guess. I was still in college at the time, and I was using my mom's car to get back and forth. \n\nApparently, according to him, and he would use my mom's phone to text ME, that I wasn't working enough hours to sustain myself, and how I should have gotten more hours while I was in school, because I \"didn't do anything after classes\". Whenever I was promoted to a manager, I always worked between 32-34 hours a week while going to school full-time. Apparently that wasn't enough. He told my mom that I was the one who was throwing away her contacts (I wasn't), that I was irresponsible, and that I was stealing stuff from her. (Make up, perfume, etc.) I always bought my own make up, and my mom always put the shampoo and body wash that she wanted me to use in the shower IN THE SHOWER. (We have a ton thanks to my grandma.) I've only ever used my mom's shampoo out of desperation, maybe twice. He began to become really cold towards me, even though I did nothing to him.\n\nHe really got irate whenever I asked him to put the brakes and rotors on my mom's car whenever the came in; he said that he would do them if he had time, I was just confirming this fact. He flipped out on my mom, who then flipped out on me, because I was \"starting drama\". And that I was the center of the drama in the house. He threatened to break up with my mom because of \"me\", because I was the \"problem\", all because I asked him to put parts on a car that aren't even that hard to do. This would become a long, running theme with him. Anything that had to do with the car, he would pounce on me and go for the offensive. One night he was looking over the car, and he lectured me by saying, \"I'm not trying to be your dad, I don't want to be, but you need to be responsible for the car.\" I went upstairs and cried because I was having a panic attack the entire time. My mom always asks me why I let shit like that get to me, and how I shouldn't be affected by what someone like him thinks, but I can't help it.\n\nHe's accused me of not caring about my mother's health.

I was the one that gave her the other possibilities of what it could be. He told me that I never even talked to her or asked her how she was doing or how her appointment went. He thinks that just because he went to the appointment with her that he's somehow superior. I guess.\n\nAfter the pittsburgh shooting, he texted me while I was at my work and belittled me for being upset. I have Jewish family members, but because I don't believe in God, that means I have no reason to be upset. He told me that all shootings are tragedies, and that I should be upset about all shootings, not just about the jewish community.

I have everything I could ever ask for and an amazing husband who treats me so wonderfully, yet I keep getting these flashes of my past. \n\nLately I have been having some seriously real dreams which cause me to wake up the following day and dwell, for hours, on the person/situation from my dream. They have been ex\u2019s that have caused me serious harm and then follows the flow of emotions from my memories. \n\nAs I am nearing 30, I can count on one hand the number of ex\u2019s that have caused this life-long scarring that I am speaking about and it all happened one after another.  I had never pressed charges or called the police on any of them and when these memories come to me these days, I kick myself for that.\n\nIn particular, two nights ago I dreamed about an ex that really, really harmed me and somehow I forgot all about what I am about to explain. I was in my second year of college and we had met through mutual friends - I think he was two years older. Things were great, but I had just broken things off with another guy and we were pretty entangled. It was kind of like a fight between the two for who would be dating me. I was at a bad point in my life at this very time, into drinking and doing drugs so you could say I was a mess.\n\nAt one point, things got so bad with the original boyfriend that I tried to end my life. The new boyfriend was my neighbor and he swooped in to be the hero and save me. We had a good connection after that, as you could imagine. So I got better and things got serious, we were a couple at this point. I started staying with him, we had sex and came to a point of decision - I wasn\u2019t on birth control, didn\u2019t want to be (personal decision) and he didn\u2019t like using condoms (personal decision) STUPID one, at that, and low and behold - I got pregnant.\n\nI can\u2019t remember if we had gotten into a relationship ending fight before this or not, but after I told him I was pregnant, the relationship ended. He did NOT want me to have the baby. I found out he had 2-3 other girls get an abortion with his child during this time.. and on came the intimidation and threats. \n\nI moved away, back home, and he stayed. Now the reason I am talking about this is because I was going to delete my school email from my phone so I searched through the inbox to see if I needed to keep anything from there and I came across an email from him that shook me to my core last night, remembering the situation.\n\nHe sent me the longest, most threatening email I have and will ever receive in my life. He said he was legally advised to send it to me. He threatened me over and over again about keeping the baby. Saying his new girlfriend will be it\u2019s mother and I will not be able to keep custody because I\u2019m a walking piece of shit. His family had money so they would fight for 18 years to ruin my life if I decided to keep the baby.\n\nI was back with the original boyfriend at this point and I let both of these men talk me into an abortion. As strong as I tried to be, #2 did scare me into doing it. And #1 claimed he wanted me to do it so we could be together. Mind you I was 20 years old and had a lot of lingering issues. \n\nWell, #1 didn\u2019t stick around for too long and around the same time, #2 cried in my arms because I GOT THE ABORTION. Like, legitimately asked me to come over and just weeped because of what I had done. \n\nA few years later we rekindled (don\u2019t ask me what I was thinking) and I don\u2019t think we ever talked about what happened. We moved north of our hometowns together and things were great until they weren\u2019t. He was pretty physical, and ended up slamming me into a table and breaking my phone. That was the breaking point - I left and flew to a different state to stay with my sister. \n\nClearly he was a manipulative, narcissistic psychopath. What kills me is that he and the other men got away with everything they\u2019ve done. I know I\u2019m not the only one it\u2019s been done to, but it makes me feel so sick and I have been living in the feelings lately.\n\nMy husband is so wonderful and truly must be an angel sent from above. Every day I find myself just so appreciative that I was given a chance to be loved by someone like him. A \u201cman\u201d that I dated for a year before my husband and I got together, was prosecuted for being abusive to another female, right after me. She contacted me and another girl and built her case against him. She asked if I wanted to join the court proceedings, but I wasn\u2019t Interested. I sometimes wish I would have because he was truly physically abusive and so mentally and emotionally abusive that I tried ending my life, again. Thanks, in part, to his kind words of \u201cwhy don\u2019t you just try and kill yourself again. Just be successful this time\u201d \n\nFrom the things I\u2019ve gone through to the place I am now, I know my hard work has really paid off. I just struggle letting go of these memories. I don\u2019t think speaking to a therapist would make them disappear, even though I would actually love to speak with one. I have over the years.

I guess in the end all I want is the final word. I've talked to friends and family about this and it's split...some say go for it while others say keep going with no contact.

She constantly belittles me and anything I've done. For example, if I make my bed, she'll ask why I didn't clean the closet. She's told me many times that I won't amount to anything and that I will fail in life. She swears at me and calls me names a lot, some of which are very hurtful because they were the same things I was bullied for in middle school (being dark skinned, being short).\n\nShe often ignores me for no reason, and will just look away when I talk to her, or go talk to my siblings instead. She is incredibly controlling, she has gone through my garbage and always goes through my backpack. She is also very inconsistent with her behavior. 9/10 times she is hostile and cruel, but sometimes she can be kind. This stresses me out, because I don't know what to expect when I go home. On top of this, I have seen her weak before, I've seen her break down and cry. And even though she's tortured me to the point where I've self harmed, when she's like this I find myself being there for her. I want to help her. I love her even after everything she's put me through.  \n\n\nI seem to bother her for no reason. Sometimes if I eat or drink in front of her, she acts as if it annoys her. This lead to me having a hard time eating in front of anyone at all.\n\nShe has seen me cry because of how she treats me, but she wasn't phased at all.\n\nShe makes me feel so unloved. It is hurtful when your own mom doesn't love you.\n\nI also don't want to become her. I can sometimes see her habits in me, like closing myself off or being annoyed at my siblings for doing nothing.\n\n1 more thing, I don't want my siblings to go through what I have. I'm 15 at the moment, and I'm not sure if I'll stay with my parents once im 18. I'm worried that with me out of the house, my mom will turn her wrath on my younger siblings.\n\nAny advice at all would be wonderful. Thank you.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Not uncoincidentally that roughly coincides with when she fired her fourth and last therapist.  The same final issue, they suggested medication.\n\nNothing we could say would convince her to go back, and everything we said she started to take as a personal attack, even if we were to look out the window and comment on the weather she'd turn it into an excuse to yell at someone.\n\nIt continued to progress.  She started to threaten to throw us out when things didn't go her way.  Then she started to threaten suicide if things didn't go her way.  And luckily she only got a violet a few times.\n\nThis group helped me recognize the signs.\n\nShe'd get home from work and walk in the door yelling and criticizing the first person she saw.  And if she didn't see anyone she'd check the bank transactions for the day to make sure I didn't spend any money.  The only money I ever spent on myself was 3 - 4 days a week I'd go to the local coffee shop and spend $2.80 on a pot of tea while I worked.  Then have it refilled for free so I'd get two pots and 6 hours in the coffee shop for $2.80 when I'd get 12 hours of work done because that's just how I work.\n\nMy favorite days I'd get yelled at for having a pot of tea came on the days when she stopped at the same tea shop and had some fancy drink then picked up a bottle or two of wine on the way home from the coffee shop.\n\nAfter the decision was made getting our things in order was also a long process.\n\nFirst order of business was finding a way to get my own money.  Luckily I work from home as a professor in a field that has ample consulting opportunities.  Students, when they graduate, can earn more than I do, but I love teaching so I teach.  But for this endeavor, I started taking some consulting gigs and putting the money aside in my own bank account.\n\nAfter about six months of saving we were ready to start looking.  We knew our city.  It was the small city about an hour away that my brother lived in.\n\nWe looked at several places, nice ones that I was lucky enough to afford, but we ended up going with the cheapest of the three we looked at seriously with the hope of being able to both buy what we needed and take as little as possible and also for us to save as much money after we moved.\n\nSo it's been five days.\n\nWe're enjoying a much quieter life and the last of our packages has arrived from Amazon.  A small dining table.\n\nOur entire apartment is about the size of the bedroom I left.\n\nThree guys, five days, and only one panic attack, my oldest, later this week we're going to be looking for a local therapist to start working with.

This was ongoing for about a year or so. As I grew older, I was able to repress those memories. Although I did have some \"hiccups\" where I would tell friends or teachers about what I experienced when I was 5-6 (I see now that my teachers did not do an adequate job in reporting any problems), I cruised through my teens pretty well. Unfortunately, in my junior year of high school, a friend sexually assaulted me. Again, I was able to convince myself that it was nothing so I started repressed that weekend as well. Fast forward a few months where my older sister threw a party at my house when my mom was at work where one of her friend's friends sexually assaulted me the morning after when he broke into my room. Again, I ventured back to repressing these memories.\n\nI entered university in fall 2016 and repressing these memories became a little bit difficult. They did impact my grades, but I was able to manage with A's and B's. Fast forward January 2018 where I was back home and was sexually assaulted by my mother's then boyfriend. Again, I tried to repress these memories as best I could since it was the only thing I knew how to do. A month goes by, two weeks before my birthday, when I get assaulted again by my roommates friend. My roommate was present and didnt do anything (I told him that I was raped before). I tried to repress these memories, but it just got so difficult, but I was able to finish the quarter with two A's and two B's. As for the next quarter, I flunked all my classes. This is unlike me, my GPA before the quarter started was about a 3.7, but it dipped.\n\nI started going to therapy for the first time in my life in June 2018 back home, and it has helped tremendously but I had to discontinue services because I had to go back to school. I started getting therapy from the rape crisis center near where I go to school but I had to discontinue services bc I ran out of services. This was around the time of the anniversary of my latest assault. I almost killed myself on my birthday.\n\nI decided to get help again, and now getting therapy from a private organization since early April. However, my grades continued to be impacted. From the 15 clases I have take since last spring quarter, I have received 3 C's, 6 F's, and 1 D. This has brought my GPA down to a 2.9. Getting into university, I never thought that this would ever happen to me.\n\nI dont know what to do at this point. After receiving my grades last night, I heavily contemplated suicide, I have banged my head against things. I just feel so worthless, out of tune. I'm not...me. I dont want to suffer anymore, I dont want to be a \"survivor of rape\" anymore. I wish none of this shit had ever happened to me.\n\nI want to drop out of school but that comes with its complications since school is my life (I consider myself, and people have reassured me as well, as an academic) and is something I want to continue in the future. So, I wouldnt know what to do with my life. Even if I come back to school, my GPA is still going to haunt me. I want to go to top five law school and grad programs, with this GPA I know that I will not have a good chance getting in.\n\nThese past 15 months have been extremely difficult. I fucked up so many relationships, i fucked up my grades, I fucked up my trajectory.\n\ni dont know what to do, I dont want to write anymore.

{"post_id": "c2mydo", "created_utc": 1560979650, "title": "A realization about my nex behavior towards social media: hypocrisy, projection and a way to punish me (and others)", "author": "throwaway200551", "self_text": "I was thinking back on how my nex dealt with his social media (mainly facebook and instagram). He had this \"above you all\" approach to it and always said people who care about social media are shallow and empty, that he believed in a world in which social media would not matter and people would only live in the moment. Curiously, he is online and active on a daily basis on SM. By the end of our relationship he used to tell me I was too obsessed with social media, with online life and so on... All this despite the fact I was never really active on social media. I don't have anything against it, I am just too lazy to post all of the time lol but I spend some of my free time on facebook. I didn't even have instagram before I met him, I just created an account there because he insisted I did, since it was his favorite SM. Turns out that now that I'm seeing through the FOG, I'm realizing he is the one obsessed with social media and was, in fact, projecting on me his feelings towards it while also using it as a platform to punish me and other people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**These are some weird aspects of his social media behavior that now, looking back, all point to his narc tendencies:**\n\n* **Deleting sprees:** During our relationship he would consistently go on these sprees in which he would delete a lot of people from his facebook page. He would show me a specific person tell me who they were (\"Oh, this used to be my friend in HS\", \"This was my best friend while I was abroad\") and proceed to delete those people. He used to say he did it because he had nothing to talk to this people anymore and would only like to keep in touch with people he was talking currently. Despite that, when people he was actually in touch with nowadays would add him as a friend on facebook or ask to follow him on IG, he sometimes would decline their request, or leave them forever in the \"limbo\" waiting to be accepted. But sometimes he would accept the request from people (specially cute girsl) he met once and never really talked to. I never thought much about it all, until after realizing he was a narc and it made crystal clear the way he treats people on SM reflects the way sees people in his life (as disposable objects that once are out of his life, or are still in his life but he doesn't care for them, aren't good enough to be in his precious SM list of friends).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Withholding likes**: He is not someone who likes or reacts a lot to other people's posts. In fact, he rarely liked or reacted to anything, despite being online on a daily basis on facebook and instagram. Sometimes, particularly during the devaluation phase, I would post something, he would be online and make sure I knew it (by posting things the or liking things after I posted) and would never like nor react to my posts or selfies while liking other people's (many times girls) posts and selfies. He acted as if a like by him on SM was some sort of precious gift he would only give to those who truly deserved it. I used to feel petty for caring, but after many occurrences I asked him about it, and he acted carefree, said he didn't even saw my posts and said I was obsessing over SM and reading too much into small details. We had a few fights about it and once he said he didn't like my posts or photos because he liked to be truthfull and sometimes my pictures had the wrong lighting or my posts were not interesting. After a long discussion about  it (I know is indeed a petty subject, but the discussions would never exist in a healthy relationship in which people don't use social media to punish their SO), he said that from then on he would like everything I posted but I should know he was doing it only to avoid other fights and it was not a wholehearted like (who would say something like that to their girlfriend?). Even after that, he never liked anything I posted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Almost never answering DMs on instagram**: He posts a lot of stories weekly and when people react or answer to those he will only answer to them when he is on the mood to do so, leaving hundreds of messages ignored. Also, this used to make me sad, because every time I sent him a DM, he would leave me on \"seen\" and never respond to my messages. Sometimes I DMd him memes, poems or actual messages and he wouldn't even acknowledge it, I would only know he saw/read them because the \"seen\" sign was there. After being ignored many many times I complained to him about it and he acted as if I was some kind of lunatic for wanting to get a reply to DMs and that I should be happy he's actually opening my DMs since he doesn't even open the DMs many people send him. He acted as if he was a Kardashian or some other celebrity who can't bother to open or read to the lots of DMs his fans send him (nevermind his IG is set to private and he only has like 200 followers. It's not like he's indeed a SM celebrity that can't keep up with the tons of messages they get daily).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* **Acting carefree about social media but being actually overly conscious about it**: He acts as if SM is bullshit, but posts on it very frequently. Sometimes, when he doesn't get many likes on a post, he'll delete it later (he never said that's why he deletes those, but I've seen there is a pattern). If he follows someone on IG and that person doesn't follow him back in a couple of days, he unfollows them (which is funny since he would act as if I were crazy for wanting reciprocity from him, who was my boyfriend, both in real life and online, but his attitudes on IG show he really values reciprocity, when it's toward him, of course... lol).", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

R was abusive. Not in the hit you kinda way but the kinda way where he made me feel like garbage all the time. \nI loved R even though he treated me like dirt. While we were dating he called me names and called me a whore and said I was disgusting. He mostly said this due to the fact that I a 21 year old female had sex before I met him. I took the name calling and the abuse. I thought I deserved it. At the time I thought he was right. I was disgusting. I was dirty and horrible and I didn\u2019t deserve him. To me R was perfect. Let me add the fact that R had been in previous relationships and also had sex before we dated. I never saw anything wrong with that. To me what he did before we got together didn\u2019t matter. As long as there were no STDs I didn\u2019t care. I loved him. \nHe has BPD (Borderline personality disorder), PTSD, and Severe Depression. He has been dealing with all since he was released from the military. I blamed all of his meanness and anger and all the bad things he did on that and the fact that I deserved it. He would tell me that he should kill him self because that was better that being alive and dating a whore like me. He would tell me how disgusting I was and how he couldn\u2019t even imagine sleeping in the same bed with me. I would always reply the same way. I would apologize and beg for his forgiveness. I would beg him to live and I would tell him he\u2019s right. \nR would then apologize and bring me small gifts. He would say he was sorry and he didn\u2019t mean the things he said. He would be sweet and loving. \nOne day 7 months ago I told him I thought I was pregnant. He told me I wasn\u2019t and if I was it didn\u2019t matter I would just get an abortion if I was. I agreed because I didn\u2019t want to fight. He was right anyways. I wasn\u2019t ready to be a mom. I was still two weeks from missing my period so no big deal. I talked to him a week later and told him I think I\u2019m pregnant. He said again it doesn\u2019t matter that I\u2019d get the abortion. I agreed because I didn\u2019t want to believe I was pregnant. I even looked up natural ways to have an abortion. I knew this would make him happy. I always wanted to make him happy. I didn\u2019t do any of the things that would cause a natural abortion. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do so. I deep down knew I was pregnant. I didn\u2019t want to kill my baby. \nThe day after my missed period I talked to R again. I told him I thought I was pregnant and wanted to take a test. He and I went and bought three different tests. I took two that night and got inconclusive results. He told me I wasn\u2019t pregnant and even if I was I\u2019d get an abortion and it wouldn\u2019t matter. The week after my missed period I took the third test. Inconclusive again. I told him I thought I was pregnant and wanted to go to the local women\u2019s pregnancy center to get a test done. He told me I was stupid but he said if it\u2019d calm me down we could.  So I set an appointment. \nI told him I didn\u2019t know if I could handle getting an abortion and he screamed at me. Told me he didn\u2019t want kids. Told me I had to get the abortion. \nR used to hate how much time I spent with my family. Before the appointment I decided to visit my mom while he was at work. I told her I thought I was pregnant and she was so excited. I told her that if I was I had to get an abortion. She told me I didn\u2019t have to if I didn\u2019t want to. I told her that he wanted me to and I wasn\u2019t ready to be a mom. She begged me to reconsider.\nI cried.\nThe day of the appointment R and I sat in the lobby of the pregnancy center and waited for them to give me the results. They told me I was right. I cried. \nThey set up an ultrasound.\nR got so mad. When we were alone he told me I was going to get an abortion and it\u2019d be fine.\nI told him I didn\u2019t want to. I told him I\u2019d rather give the baby to a family who would be happy to have it.\nI invited my mom and his grandmother to the ultrasound and that pissed R off more. He said that I still had to get an abortion.\nThe day of the ultrasound my mom, R, R\u2019s grandmother and I sat in the waiting room. His grandmother and my mom were trying to convince \u201cus\u201d to keep the baby. I wanted to. I so badly wanted to raise my baby.\nHe told them I could keep the baby.\nI cried and smiled and hugged him. I was so happy. My heart felt so full. I was so happy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever felt so happy.\nWe went into the ultrasound room and I got to see my little peanut. I got to hear the heart beat. I was so happy I got to keep my little peanut. My mom held my hand and cried. His grandmother cried. He stood emotionless as he looked at my precious little baby. I was so happy. \nI took him home telling him how happy I was.\nHe stopped me from getting out of the car. He told me I was still getting an abortion. \nI was shocked. \nI wanted to keep my peanut. He told me I could.\nI told R I was keeping peanut. \nThis pissed him off. I went inside and started getting my stuff together. He grabbed me and spun me around and told me I was getting an abortion or he\u2019d take care of it himself. He then pushed me. I fell back. I was so afraid I called my sister.\nI was sobbing and left the house quickly. \nI broke up with him.\nI moved back in with my parents. \nI decided I deserved better and so did peanut.\nThat\u2019s when things started getting worse.\nHe tried to kill himself.\nR blamed me. He told everyone I was the reason he tried to kill himself. \nHe kept calling and sending me such mean texts.\nI changed my number. \nR got admitted to a mental hospital for two weeks.\nThe day he was released I thought things would be different.

I just didn't think that making me tell my mom that something horrible had happened to my sister was anything other than uncomfortable, and the duct tape stuff was wildly upsetting, since I didn't like people touching me in normal situations, but hoo, boy, was that minimal contact, comparatively.\n       Things kind of slowed down for me when my sister hit middle school though- it really switched up the dynamic, since my sister went from an  ordinary bratty kid to a kinda standard angsty preteen, and James seemed to decide that he hated her more than me, as he started railing on her for her weight (she was not, and is not, anywhere near overweight), her friends, her work ethic when cleaning, and all sorts of other things. That standard teen rebellion stuff led to lots of very loud, slightly physical shouting matches between  them that I spent the next five-ish years desperately trying to block out from inside of my bedroom.\n       In this chunk of time, my sister and I had started doing more chores, and if we forgot to do them, or didn't do them well enough (a standard that wildly fluctuated from day to day) we would be punished, which is normal enough, I suppose. It was just very frustrating, because it is hard to do something \"without being told\" when you get berated for, say, feeding the dogs early, and feeding the dogs late, but the time at which we have \" always\" fed them changes all the time, or when suddenly not cleaning the windows along  with the floors was unacceptable. I often got in trouble for cleaning the dishes \"too meticulously\" when he was upset with me, and he called me a Hitler youth for the way I fold towels. We weren't given an allowance for doing chores, and the reasoning was that we were \"paying\" to have clothes and food, which is whatever, I guess. We were both in trouble almost constantly, and I think that people that we interacted with at school thought that our parents were crazy when we'd say so, since we were always pretty well behaved kids.\n      This time marks another point, as this is when he began to constantly accuse me of lying- he never believed that I had homework to do, and would accuse me of trying to get out of doing housework. I guess that this is a good enough point to say that I have \"autism, maybe\", or at least lots of compulsive hang ups about finishing things before I start others and doing things \"correctly\" (properly, in order, with enough time to mentally \"switch gears\"), and the fact that he would constantly bust into my personal space (also very important to me) and angrily demand that I \"get off my ass\" (stop doing my homework) immediately to do something or other that he came up with for me to do really made it hard to do what I needed for school, and there was some time where it was really hurting my grades, which in turn got me yelled at for \"not trying\" in school. (I became severely depressed, and the pressure about school let up when I told my mom that I was having dangerous inclinations, but all of this eventually led to another part of the point of this).\n        It was during the middle of this time that I was really beginning to get fed up with him, as the little things that I didn't like but tolerated started to bother me more and more, like when he would order me to hug him, barge into my room and move my stuff (very upsetting to me), say creepy or upsetting things to me as a joke (acting as though I was a delusional patient in an asylum, asking me, a middle schooler, if I was \"having sexy times\" when I was in my room), or simply berating me as he had in the past, with new additions ( \"Hitler youth\"- mentioned above, saying that I looked like I had just walked out of Auschwitz- unprompted, and literally calling me Hitler- 20 min late feeding the dogs, telling me that I am abusive to animals). The fact that these things made me upset led to me trying to get my mom to do something about it, about anything, by talking to her, and if she ever really did anything that worked, I didn't see it, because most of the time after I would talk to her, he'd get worse, he'd mock me with things that I had told her, and he started mocking and threatening me with punishment for talking to her about it at all.\n        After a few years of this, James started telling me that I was an \"angry and hateful person\", that I \"used to be nice\"- he started saying that I was manipulative for talking to my mom about him, that I was trying to convince her that he was in the wrong because I hated him, and that I was always \"playing\" my mom as part of an elaborate \"game\" (he insisted that the depressive episodes I had were part of me deliberately trying to make my mom miserable (I was already convinced that my existence made my mom miserable, so it was a sore spot), but I digress). I think that he really convinced my mom of that. Worst of all, I'm not sure that I  can be certain that he's wrong- what if I am manipulative? I mean, not too long ago I finally decided that I would hate him, and I feel so bitter and angry about it all, and there's so much time that I feel like a bad person, I'm afraid that he's right, about everything- that I'm a terrible, boring, creepy, unfunny, unlikable, manipulative person that cares too much about stupid shit like how to fold towels.\n         \n\nTL/DR  my mother's boyfriend has been harassing and maybe gaslighting me for years, but the fact I kind of hate him makes me feel like he's right about me being an angry, manipulative, awful person, because I really, genuinely feel like I'm an awful person a lot of the time\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I don't really trust him when he does act decent now, as the bad parts come in cycles, kind of, but I think that a big problem is that no one besides my sister seems to believe that he is a bad guy, which also makes me think that it might just be me being a bad person", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

My NEx attempted to have his friend serve me child custody paperwork today. I didn\u2019t answer the door as I originally thought it was a salesperson.

A family member came and took me to their house so I wouldn\u2019t have to be alone. We were heading down my street and both looked at each other and said \u201cis that Nex\u2019s car?\u201d parked 4 houses up from mine.

She is incredibly kind, a great listener, so sweet, and the most innocent person you\u2019d ever meet. It seems like an unlikely match, but she doesn\u2019t have a mean bone in her body. Both of them go to school together. When they first met, he developed feelings for her, but they went away after a couple of weeks because he says he realized they were better as friends. She never made me uncomfortable in our relationship even though he constantly talked to girls behind my back (especially ones he \u201cused\u201d to have feelings for/almost dated or did date), lied about who he talked to, withheld the truth, belittled my feelings, and treated her and every other random girl he met better than he ever treated me (I texted him a goodbye and told him how I felt, and he just ignored it and was able to move on so fast, as before I blocked him on social media, he started following all of the girls that tried to flirt with him while we were together, and the ones he unfollowed just to appease me) Classic narcissist. \n\nWe broke up a month ago, and he\u2019s been spending time with his friends, including the best friend. This best friend mentioned in the beginning. She confides in me all the time, always tells me about exciting things going on in her life, and is always looking forward to hanging out with me. She never brings him up, and she genuinely cares about what I have to say. Her and my Nex hung out yesterday and I said to her \u201cif he said anything about me it probably wasn\u2019t very nice\u201d and she agreed, but I didn\u2019t ask any questions or push it further because I didn\u2019t want to make her feel like she was betraying her friend by telling me anything. I still want to be friends with her, but I feel like my Nex never completely got over her (he really did treat her better than me, was there for her more than me, and liked personality traits she had that I had as well, but treated mine as flaws, and he just spoke to her more and talked about her as if he was a schoolgirl with a crush) so it hurts to know they\u2019re hanging out even though she has no feelings for him (one of the things she confides in me about is guys, she has really strong feelings for two of them and she always updates me on things they say to her and she is absolutely smitten with them) and frankly seems a little tired of the way he acts sometimes (she has a Nex as well, but she never  talks about it). \n\nI decided I would tell her what happened between me and my Nex, because I wanted her to know what I was feeling and thinking before moving forward with or friendship. It\u2019s hard to tell someone that their best friend abused you, and I never wanted to influence her opinion, just be honest about the situation since it\u2019s clear he has been saying things that aren\u2019t so nice about me. She listened to everything I had to say, said she can see how he would act that way given the way he acts at school/around her, and that my situation even reminded her of her Nex. I just feel conflicted because they still talk and my Nex is openly flirting with her at this point (on social media as well, before I blocked him) even though she just wants to be friends, and I feel like I was meaningless (I mean I was, I was just a supply, but this still hurts like a bitch) and that he wanted her all along, along with every other girl he spoke to. I guess if I\u2019m not special, she won\u2019t be either. Nobody is to a narcissist. I want to continue being friends with her, but it\u2019s difficult when she hangs out with him and hears his smear campaign. But she still wants to be friends with me and likes me, so I assume she knows he\u2019s full of it. I feel like I\u2019m at a dead end and this situation caused me to have an awful nightmare about him. I just want to curl up into a ball and cry.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was with my narc for 4 years during that time he cheated on me with two women. One of them was a close mutual friend in the city and the other was his online friend. He claimed that he was becoming poly and in order to be with someone she HAS to give him the option to be open to flirt/ touch other women. I always called bullshit on that because it was clear he is too secretive and couldn't handle one relationship how could he handle multiple? Anyways, after disposing of me he got together with the girl online. I did warn her of his behaviour with women and relationship but she went with him anyway and eventually married him. I am still positive he just used polyamory as an excuse to cheat. I remember he wouldn't even show a picture of us together to this girl because he didn't want HER to get jealous. Do you think he will treat her like that? Will his marriage burst into flames eventually? Any others who are in a  similar situation?

Since most of them are men (and one woman); I seriously begin to doubt they are just the ones to have lose the most; since they have rapy tendicy's themselves.

Last year was complicated, I had health issues with consequences on my body image which is the reason I chose to not date anybody.\n\nIn March I was feeling better so I started to date again. Met this guy (also in his thirties) on a dating app. We were talking a lot, had a lot in common, and I felt a real connection with him so I asked him if he wanted to get drinks. It was like love at first sight for me\u2026 In my opinion (at the time) it was mutual and he kissed me before even the end of the date. I liked it but at the same time deep down I felt like it was too soon. He asked me to come to his place which I declined telling him I like to take things slow. He was totally ok with it and he continued to send me cute and adorable texts and we saw each other on a second date (where he kept telling me sweet stuff, never too obvious though, just compliments but it felt sometimes too good to be true like everything I wanted to hear). Some things were strange though: he wanted to tell me how much money he was making at his new job (it\u2019s a bit rude in my country to display your wealth), he had this very intense stare that was both frightening and arousing, he told me he could be very sensitive sometimes and that he liked to tease people, and he also liked to make sex references (I felt a little pressured to have sex, but not overly, like always with him actually, everything was very subtle).\n\nWe ended up having sex on the third date and it was pretty nice, I have to admit. On the fourth date, he started to act less \u201cnice\u201d. Still sweet and (falsely?) empathetic about some stuff, but on the other hand he was criticizing other people, being moody, telling me how busy he was, and for the first time he called me names (Nothing really insulting, I can\u2019t really translate it) the moment I tried to express boundaries. We didn\u2019t see each other for a week and during that week he was starting to act like a little crybaby (sending me texts complaining about how tired he was and about his hangovers for example) but also nice sometimes, so blowing hot and cold. He felt that I was not liking it and asked to see me on a fifth date which was nice but he revealed other things about him: how he could get very jealous in a relationship, how important it is for him to look good. Of course we ended up at his place and had sex again. We didn\u2019t see each other for a week after that. I went to his place and he was less and less nice. We had sex and for the first time I felt like he really didn\u2019t care about my pleasure. When I tried to talk about it (not very well I have to admit) he started to sulk and then later called me names again but this time it was stronger (kind of like asshole). I didn\u2019t sleep well that night and had a huge knot in my stomach. The next morning I tried to talk to him about it, he said he was sorry. But after that we didn\u2019t see each other for 2 weeks and I felt like it was a way of punishing me for expressing myself (told me he was too busy with this new demanding job, he was sorry etc\u2026). \n\nWe saw each other for 2 other times where he was blowing hot and cold (sweet and then moody) and one time he even told me out of the blue to shut the fuck up. I told him later that it was not ok to say that and he answered I was too fragile. 2 days after I finally told him by text that I was feeling there was a lack of communication between us and he answered that it was because he could not move things forward with me. \n\nI took the decision to end things, that I was disappointed but also thanking him for our time together. He agreed and told me how much more mature I was compared to him. \n\nIt was early may and we haven\u2019t talked since that time. But yesterday I noticed he unfollowed me out of the blue on social media (I didn\u2019t). I wonder if it\u2019s a way for him to get a reaction from me (I won\u2019t)? \n\nFor all the time we were together, I was not feeling like myself, lost weight, and never felt secure.

I'm a 30 year old man. I was born and raised in the south, but eventually moved to the west coast. I had several abusers throughout my childhood, but the one who did the most damage was my father. Well, for the context of privacy I will refer to him as dad, but I do not by any means deign to refer to him by that. IRL I refer to him by his first name, the man who gets to be called Dad is my loving stepfather, who treats me like his own.\n\nI will spare you lengthy sentences and try to keep this brief and concise by referring to events in bullet points.\n\n\u2022 Dad was physically abusive. He frequently fought with my mother. I have a vivid memory of playing Gamecube with the two of them fist fighting on the couch behind me. He was also frequently physically abusive to my sister. I remember an instance, when we were teens, where he shoved her up against the wall, trying to strangle her.\n\n\u2022 He often dismissed my interests and frequently compared me to my friends. When speaking to a friend's father, for instance, right in front of us, he would often say something like this:\n\nFriend's dad: \"Oh, I (forced) got my son into playing Tennis!\"\n\nDad: \"Oh, I've been trying to get Uglarinn to do that!\" *que the look of mild disdain for my failings*\n\n\u2022 He was religeous to an insane degree. I'm not talking about actually following the bible. I am talking about that culty go to church every sunday and Halloween is satan's holiday/burn your Harry Potter books kind of Christianity. He imposed his way of thinking upon us so strongly that I briefly became agnostic and my sister, to this day, is convinced she is going to hell for every minor infraction. Dad taught us that God would only forgive you so many times before you commited some kind of \"unforgiveable sin\" (which my sister is obsessed with btw) and could no longer be forgiven.\n\n\u2022 Occasionally the physical abuse extended to me, but rarely. Often, for me, it was belts, switches and spankings by hand to begin with. The only really bad instance, I remember, was being struck across the face for talking back, as I was tired of his shit by that point.\n\n\u2022 Corporal punishment was a common thing in our household. My sister and I would be forced to sit in corners in \"time out\" for 30 mins to an hour crying and facing the wall. He would often select our favorite toys, hang them up on a nail in a shopping bag and exclaim that he was going to sell them as a punishment for our bad behavior.\n\n\u2022 I did not get a driver's license until I was 28 and living on the west coast. I was terrified of driving for years. Dad tried to teach me, but spent the whole time screaming at me.\n\n\u2022 Mom and dad mercifully divorced, but one day mom brought in a new bf without any prior warning. He was an abusive alcoholic. I threatend his life with a bb gun (I didn't own a real one at the time) when he attrmpted to strike my sister in one of his drunken moods. I also prevented him from slicing his own throat open with a steak knife, ironically.\n\n\u2022 Dad remarried. My sister (a teenager) was sexually assaulted by his wife's brother. Dad convinced her to drop charges against him, as he would \"take care of it himself\" and he wanted to save embarassment in the church as his wife and her brother were related to the preacher (their uncle). There is more that I may add later, but this is all the time I have for right now. (I am on break at work.)\n\nSuffice to say I am no longer in that situation.

Found beer bottles and cigs at her place and she didn\u2019t even smoke, she said it was from the neighbor but then when I was helping her move, the neighbor doesn\u2019t even live there anymore.

I get one day off, she\u2019s able to start a new job fast forward two months into the job and I surprise her with a phone case she gets while I\u2019m at work.

She doesn\u2019t tell the truth again, I ask one of my friends that work with her and turns out the whole time she\u2019s at work she\u2019s with a guy and they go off site to lunch and sit in each other\u2019s cars.

She went nuts. \n\nShe contacts me everyday saying I was the best, I miss you, I want to work on things with you, etc \nBut still entertains that guy \n\nThe worst part from all the moments I thought i was so crazy, she told me I\u2019m the narcissist and I really question myself daily over it. \n\nI know ultimately I need another job to be able to be away from her grasp, but I hate how they can say everything you needed to hear in the relationship after it was all over. \n\nAnd I HATE the feeling of still wanting to help and provide and make her life easier.

I want a relationship with my dad and my childhood home and I'm at an age where marriage is coming up with my partner, and I'm going to be having my own children soon.  I want my dad and childhood home to be some part of that and I do NOT want her involved in it at all.  The thought of her looking at them or wanting to touch them is nauseating.  Just no.  \n\nMy partner and I are flying to visit in a few days and it's his first time coming with me.... it's really triggering a lot of bad emotions because I know she's expecting to meet him (it's my dad's first time meeting him too) and for the last few days instead of being really excited I've been crying all day.  I'm super depressed about the whole trip that I was previously looking forward to.  My partner totally gets it and he's really understanding \"we don't have to do anything you don't want to do; we don't have to see her\", he's great.  \n\nBut my dad will not let go of it.  He's always calling me and telling me how much it means to her if I call her on her birthday (it was yesterday.  another trigger for me.  but i didn't call. and I couldn't call him either bc he'd then bring it up-trigger).  And he forces the visits.  He says the typical \"she's not gonna be alive forever, you'll regret it if you don't do \\_\\_\\_\\_\" kinda stuff.  \"she's your mom\".  I don't feel like I need to give details of what the abuse was or what that means here or to my dad or to my mom at this point, I'm 30 years old and it's honestly not like I haven't tried telling him or her how I was feeling back then what was happening; no one was hearing me and no one thought anything of it and no one believed me.  I have a sister that's really messed up in really different ways so that kinda makes it ..... just a really interesting situation.  \n\nBut it doesn't matter, yeah?  I don't owe anyone anything.  I only should have to say no.  And my whole life it's never been enough.  So I'm basically sitting here crying bc I'm feeling like in order to be rid of my abusive parent I'm also going to have to cut out the one that I love, and never visit the childhood home that I love too.  And my kids will just never get to know or see anything of my childhood.  Because what's any other solution?  Even if my dad finally says \"okay fine\" I know he will still keep bringing it up and I don't even want to fucking talk about it anymore...... I just want her out of conversation.  Stop trying to guilt trip me and telling me that my behavior is hurting someone.  She hurt me.  Why doesn't that matter to you????\n\nI love my dad so much :( :( I don't want to lose him.  I really, really don't.  He's pretty physically ill.  It broke my heart to move to the other side of the country tbh.  I hate that I can't be near him more.  I'd hate to not have him in my life at all.  But I really really don't know what to do.  And I have a lot of physical health problems of my own.  And I love visiting my childhood home.  Is there any other solution here that I don't see?  I feel really trapped by this situation and I don't want to be so stuck anymore.  I need to find a way out before I get married and have kids.

I'm fully willing to have a conversation if something I'm doing bothers her, but I never seem to be able to keep a conversation about HER doing something that bothers ME on track.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3)  She will use negative non-verbal cues to initiate conversations about the things that I'm doing \"wrong\".  These conversations happens at least once per month, if not more.  Here's the one we had a few days ago, without warning, after an awesome day/date night together:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were be lying in bed, and she kept glancing over at me with eyebrows raised (picture a look that says \"well, are we going to talk, or not?\").  When I turned to face her, she let out an exasperated sigh, rolled her eyes, and turned her body so that her back was to me.  I asked her if something was bothering her, and she started to unload on me (more you always.../you never... type stuff).  I tried again and again to explain my thoughts and feelings to her, but she kept telling me that she doesn't understand me, and that I never open up to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n4) She will throw tantrums.  I don't mean to sound facetious, but there really isn't a better word I can think of.  She will use a whiny, over-exaggerated childish tone when complaining about things.  I usually try to ignore, but this happens a LOT (and my ignoring it will often add to the accusations that I don't care about her).  I will sometimes even apologize for things I never even did just to get her in a good mood again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5) She will give me \"options\"  (ie: Do you want to go over to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_'s house with me?)  It is usually quite obvious which choice she wants me to make, and if I pick the wrong one, it's often more of \"you never want to do anything/you're so fucking lazy\" type stuff from her (I work two jobs and am trying to start a business on the side).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6) I do most of the housework (dishes, cleaning, laundry, etc.)  She does help out sometimes, but it's few and far between.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7) She shit-talks people behind their back.  Her family, her friends, her co-workers, random people.  It happens daily.  I tried bringing this up once, as it makes me uncomfortable.  Her response was \"holy shit, are you fucking serious?\", followed by the silent treatment for a couple of hours, followed by her telling me that if I'm not going to be there to support her when she's feeling down then why even bother being in a relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n8) Drinking amplifies everything.  If she's planning to have any more than two drinks, there's a huge chance that the night will end in her crying and screaming at me.  I have also tried to bring this up to her, but she laughs it off and says it's just the alcohol, not to take it seriously.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n9) She goes through loving (love-bombing?) phases.  I'm currently in the middle of one right now I think.  Compliments all day long, loving hugs and cuddles, hot passionate sex two times or more per day, constant statements that idealize me (I don't know what I did to deserve such a perfect man in my life, etc.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n10) She will guilt me.  This can be about what I'm wearing, what I'm doing, or anything else really.  She will often tell me she's \"embarrassed for me\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have gone from an introverted, but confident and happy man to nervous and confused with constant feeling of guilt and failure as a partner.  I don't know if there's something wrong with me, with her, with our relationship, or with all of the above.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Has anyone ever experienced anything similar?", "author": "melody_c9", "self_text": "Hi there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry - this is going to be a **very long post**. I just need to write it all down, as part of my healing process and, maybe, to get some answers from you guys.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, I know that I will never know *for sure* if he was a narcissist. \n\nSecond, I had my thoughts about him being a narc already years ago - so I'm not just saying \"it didn't work, he **must** be a narcissist\".\n\nThird, some might say it doesn't matter whether he was a narcissist / had narcissistic tendencies - it's over anyway. But I'm so hurt and would still like to get some answers as I am very confused.\n\nand...\n\nFourth: I have read about narcissism / narcissistic personality disorder for years. I'm not an expert though and am happy talk to others about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The relationship / background**\n\nI am a 28 year old woman who just got out of a relationship with a 25 year old man. We were together for almost 3 years, we met in his home country (we're both from central/western Europe), where we lived together on / off because of my studies for almost 2 years.\n\nWhen we met he bought be roses, not just once or twice but several times. This is something noone had ever done to me. Yeah I've gotten roses before, but he was different (love bombing?). We went for dinner, had fun, and I remember googling \"what does it feel like when you meet your soulmate\" because I thought I really met \"the one\". I was so happy, finally I was with the perfect man, and so on. (not saying that every man who buys his woman flowers all the time is a narc ofc! There are also gentlemen out there. But me, and neither of my friends, had ever experienced this before like that).\n\nYet he started talking about his ex very soon. They just had broken up a few months earlier and he had to mention her all the time. He wasn't saying good things about her though. She was a \"crazy bitch\". He even called her \"*the bitch*\" when he talked about her. He said she was a psychopath (she really was very mentally ill as I later found out, so I actually believed him for very long), was dumb, was mean, and so on and so forth. She even destroyed his room after they broke up. Who on earth would do this to such a lovely man, I thought? Now I - kind of - know why she did it.\n\nHe also had to tell me some other details, about intimate piercings she had, about how sex wasn't good with her, how he enjoyed sex more with the girl he met up with after her, and so on. I'm not the most self-confident person, so I had bad problems because of his ex - talk throughout our entire relationship.\n\nI barely mentioned my 2 long-term ex boyfriends, as I find it inappropriate. Yet I told him some standard things, how old they were, how long it lasted. Briefly mentioned why it didn't work out. Also said that I was backpacking with one of them for a few months. HELL. Jealousy! He insulted me because of the fact that I travelled with someone for years. And I swear, I avoided talking about it so much.\n\nAnyway, \"The bitch\" contacted him as soon as she heard about our relationship from someone else. He then skyped with her, even though I didn't like it, claiming she was \"suicidal\" and he needed to talk to her. Now I think it boosted his ego that she wanted him back after she saw him with someone else. I know everyone is different, but I wouldn't necessarily skype with an ex I refer to as \"the bitch\" and am not in contact with (= no friends anymore) if I had a new partner. Just out of respect. Whatever.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDuring the next months, maybe after about 6 months or so, he started twisting everything I said, I started feeling something wasn't right in my head anymore. So many examples I don't even remember. But I remember being confused around this man, all the time. He was extremely sensitive, one \"wrong\" and harmless comment about something could turn him into a 3-year old child. \n\nHorrible fights started happening, and I \"lost it\" over and over again. No one had ever made me so mad. I'm not sure if this is common around narcissists, or whatever problem he might have, but I didn't understand his mind. It seemed as he couldn't think clearly / rationally, everything was turned and twisted around. He wasn't even to have proper conversations.\n\nHe would call me a whore, a crazy freak, and constantly **provoke me** during fights. Little things, big things. He knew how to \"push my buttons\".\n\nHe knew I had problems in the past (depression, wasn't able to finish the first course I started etc.), so he used it against me, which triggered me. Our fights were very destructive and unhealthy, and I didn't understand what had happened to me.\n\n**Throughout the entire relationship he was either a cold assh\\*le or a loving prince.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe pretended to care about me, but never cooked, hardly ever cleaned the house. He did pay for a few things for a while to be fair, as he has a lot more money than me, but I washed his clothes and cooked. Every day basically.\n\nHe didn't really care about my interests, the place I wanted to move to, said a few times that he had enough of this shit (my passion), even made me cry in front of his friend in the pub. After my final exams I went for drinks with an old friend, unfortunately male but freshly engaged, we even invited my ex to join us, but he declined, was angry, treated me like shit, with his common \"asshole attitude\". My last day of college was ruined again, thanks to him. I remember how I was crying and shouting and feeling desperate.\n\nMany things I said (e.g. you never wanna plan our future and make compromises), he used later on in the relationship, and said ***I*** was the one who didn't care. After I honestly tried to get him to talk about our future for ages.\n\nNo mater what I said, if I said X, he used X later on, said the very same about me. Weird. Confusing. I still don't even know how to write or even think about this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also feel like he was lying to me about some things. I cannot proof it for sure, but you know when you just get that certain feeling in your stomach?\n\nI don't think he was cheating on me. I know people say that most narcs do this, but I don't think he was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes he was a really nice boyfriend and we had fun.\n\nBut still: Almost every weekend we fought.\n\nEvery time I left crying, he begged me to stay or to come back.\n\nHe was able to switch from hot to cold to hot again within seconds. I think all men should be allowed to cry (of course!) but I saw him crying like a toddler many times. I saw my male family members cry before, other men, but I've never seen this before. Like a hurt child. Almost creepy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHis family is an absolut mess. I mean a *proper* mess. The worst family I have ever met, and I'm not just saying it.\n\nHis father doesn't talk. Few words a day. Was in the army, and I think it fucked him up.\n\nHis mum isn't very nice to me either, also not to his friends or anyone else. Doesn't know how to have a proper conversation. They never asked me questions, never showed interest in me.\n\nHis siblings have extreme problems. Drugs, extreme mental health issues, unemployed for years, problems with their sexuality and own self etc.  My ex said his dad never talked to him properly his entire life (until a couple of years ago), and I think his mum has proper issues too, and wasn't particularly nice to him either. He kind of gets along with them now though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI seriously forgot half of the things that have happened. It's very weird, as I usually have a very, very good memory (according to friends, family etc.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I'm not saying I'm perfect. I have problems too. But I have not experienced this before.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The break-up**\n\nTrying to make this one short: I flew home to be with my family about 2.5 weeks ago. I was initially meant to stay here for 3 weeks and go back to stay with him. I'm working from home at the moment so I can do this kinda stuff.\n\nAfter I was here for 1 week it started.\n\nHe didn't talk to me for a day. Then he said he's breaking up with me. He started insulting me. Remember, I wasn't the one talking about my ex all the time, yet he was saying I'm horrible, did everything with my ex, stuff I've never done with him, I'm a whore, stole condoms, cheated on him, again, a whore, don't care about him, and so on and so forth. This happened after I nicely told him that I don't think it's a good idea if he comes to visit me on my family \"holiday\", as I have to work and it would be boring for him.\n\nSo he insulted me, and broke up.\n\n2 days later we talked again (We had \"broken up\" in our wonderful fights many times, but never properly), but he still wanted to break up. I tried to explain myself, said that it has nothing to do with him that I can't travel with him right now, money, life situation etc.\n\nAnd we messaged a bit for a few days, whatever, people say this is not good but I was still like what's going on, + I have all my clothes in his house, so I can't just stop talking to him.\n\nThen at some point he started saying I don't want him back, I'm not trying, it shocks him how I don't love him, etc.\n\nHe wanted me to BEG for his love, I didn't do it, he got pissed.\n\nWhat a f\\*cking game.\n\nEventually, he gave in, started begging, started sending me photos of us, started saying he will change, we can change, we can move to my fav place (HAHA! Suddenly!? He really wasn't interested before, even though it's a very good place for work, beautiful nature etc.). All these promises.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is still going on.\n\nHe expects me to fly back next week. He doesn't get it.\n\n**He broke up with me, thought I would run back to him, and I didn't.** \n\nHIS GAME DIDN'T WORK OUT!\n\nAll my friends support me. My family does. Noone wants me to get back with him. NOONE. Everyone who has met him agrees that he is weird. He doesn't even really try to talk to my friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI heard trying to get someone back like this is called \"hoovering\", and is also a common thing narcs do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat do you guys think of my story?\n\nDo you think he is a narc? Or maybe just an overly sensitive person with lots of issues because of his family / childhood?\n\nDid he want to gain power / control over me by breaking up with me because he thought I was weak enough to run back into his arms?\n\nAnd: can anyone help me? What should I do? I know I need to finally block him, but I still need to go back to his country &amp; his house (in August) to get my stuff. Noone can get it for me btw, all my friends moved away from this town (we were studying there and they honestly all left)..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease note that I'm not doing well mentally at all; No mean comments please.\n\nThank you.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The jist of this, I was with my ex for two years he is 29 and I am 25... it didn\u2019t take me until a couple months ago to realize how passive aggressive he was. He was very selfish and manipulative. We\u2019ve been broken up for about two years but I am still struggling with everything and I don\u2019t feel like this is normal. During our relationship I caught him cheating literally in the act ... I took him back (dumb I know) anyways after that I started to get paranoid, jealous. I will admit I had some toxic tendencies in the relationship. I remember not feeling good enough, worthless, ugly, very insecure. He would drink a lot and I remember missing work the next morning or calling in bc it would be a fight just to go home early. I could never talk about how I felt about things because I\u2019d be \u201cstarting an argument\u201d or \u201c dramatic\u201d, \u201c that\u2019s not how it happened\u201d. We had good times, we would travel places and have fun together. We had the same exact sense of humor and we laughed together.  He would always try to leave me and I was hurt at first and I would cry, I\u2019d be upset but I wouldn\u2019t say anything just let him go and then he\u2019d take me back. It got to the point where I\u2019d be begging him to stay with me when he tried to leave over and over and idk if it was because he felt sorry for me or not? He left me via text while I was in the hospital. He got tired of waiting. He was only waiting for thirty minutes. It tore me apart. When he met me to pack his things I was crying my eyes out and he had this look in his eye I could swear it was satisfaction but idk.. maybe I want to paint him out to be the bad guy so I can move on? Anyways after our break up, he slept with my \u201cfriends\u201d. He let some random girl tell me to kill myswlf and no one would miss me while he was right beside her and didn\u2019t say a word to stand up for me. I felt like trash like I meant absolutely nothing to him. He would speak to me while he was out of town working but once he got back home I didn\u2019t exsist to him. He\u2019d shut me out. When I try to tell him how it made me feel he\u2019d give me the silent treatment for days sometimes weeks and tell me I\u2019m being negative and starting arguments. Recently I caved after two months no contact to see how he was doing, he told me he hoped I was doing well and that whoever ends up with me is a lucky man and I didn\u2019t deserve the treatment he gave me and he knew he was passive aggressive towards me and to never end up with someone like him.. then he went on to say he was gonna treat his girlfriend better, that, that might not be fair but that\u2019s life. I told him I appreciated his apology but that last part wasn\u2019t necessary and that I actually really hurt my feelings. He went on to say \u201c this has been going on too long. You always try to find ways to hate me and are always negative and try to start arguments\u201d he didn\u2019t reply to my message and then blocked me. I was so confused. I\u2019m afraid he will be a better person to his now girlfriend. That he has changed for the better and it will be with her. I obsess at the thought of this and I try not too. Idk what to do or think anyways. I\u2019m not sure if he is a nar or just an asshole or if he will actually change. I know I was toxic, I\u2019d yell, get frustrated and mad and take it out in bim. I sought out therapy for help and it\u2019s been two years and it\u2019s helping some but why can\u2019t I get past this!?\nAny advice is welcome", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Anyways, I need you strong souls to help me decide whether or not my ex was a narcissist, I feel like I need other opinions to verify it. I started talking to this guy a year ago during this time, I met him online, he lives in Cali and I live in Az so it was long distance. Although, that didn\u2019t really stop him from being abusive. Btw I was 17 at the time and he was 30, he lied to me about his age (27) -which i didnt mind because im attracted to older guys. He would get mad at me for the dumbest stuff such as dying in a video game (we would play online) and he\u2019ll block me on everything and wouldn\u2019t talk to me then eventually come back, apologize, and blame it on his personal life. This happened repeatedly to the point where I would expect it every month. He would also make me send sexual photos and videos that I was not comfortable with but said if I didn\u2019t do it that it meant i didnt love him or trust him. Fast forward to January 2019 he visited to me from California, it was my first time meeting him, I was scared and excited all those emotions, when I met him he was skinnier than his photos, he had bloodshot eyes, and veiny arms, (i was guessing he\u2019s on drugs??) because he also offered me molly. He was drinking and smoking in front of me he also stold from walmart. We also had sex :/ i was still 17 at the time (2 weeks before my birthday). When he went back home everything was fine, then on my birthday i got a dm from his sister asking me to give her my address and phone number to that my ex could contact me from jail she told me that he violated probation, I knew absolutely nothing about him being on probation. Online it said \u201cconspiracy to commit a crime\u201d but he still did not tell me why he was incarcerated, and this is when I found out his real age. (I found out before bc i saw his facebook but he denied it). He sent me letters from prison and they sounded so sincere and when he got out of jail he told me that he wanted to change and that he was sorry for all of his wrong doings. March came around he completely stopped talking to me actually he was ignoring me I had my friend dm him asking him to contact me and he ended up doing 2 weeks later, he told me he was in rehab which then he said that he really wasnt that i was too clingy and he didnt like me. He was threatening my friend through dms saying he was going to beat up her family and her mom read those messages and told me she was going to tell the police and i felt like i had to tell my parents about this relationship ive been having with this man. So i dont know why i did this but i left him a voicemail and told him that i was going to tell my parents about his and i\u2019s relationship he called me back 2 hours later and threatened to kill someone i loved and that he was on his way to my state, he was screaming at me, threats after threats over the phone, i was terrified. The law enforcement said they couldnt do anything. But i still check his social media just about everyday :( and recently i told him to block me, and he never did we basically forgave eachother which felt good and i told him that i didnt want to pursue this relationship and his reply was \u201cwho is this, you got the wrong number\u201d :/ he\u2019s such an asshole. im sorry this is really long i just need some advice \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Scraped up my shoulder pretty bad, rug burn that took off a nice area of skin, and some rug burn/scraping on my arms and legs but it was really nothing. Didn\u2019t hit my head, baby is still kicking, no bleeding or contractions or pain (I\u2019ve got an ultrasound in the morning, so everything will be checked out anyway).\n\nI started crying pretty hard, called my husband, cleaned myself up. But I\u2019ve had flashbacks all day. Not panic attack inducing ones, so that\u2019s a big improvement. Just bad memories of childhood abuse. Getting rug burn from being dragged down the hallway, taking pictures of bruises and welts, the screaming, and feeling of lack of control over what happens to my body. The discomfort of having to lay certain ways not to aggravate the wounds. Idk. The feeling of being hurt I guess. \n\nWhen my (really wonderful) in laws found out I fell, they came over to check on me and bring me food, which was super nice, but they kept saying I should have called them and stuff, and I didn\u2019t know how to explain that it triggered me and I just wanted to hide and I\u2019m scared that if anyone is around I\u2019ll just be describing all my memories and feel embarrassed later. That I have a gut reaction to feel shame when I\u2019m hurt, a gut reaction to hide it, and hide myself. And that I\u2019m just feeling really really sad. I have a good life now, I\u2019m happy with it, but I just feel really sad today. \n\nI\u2019ve been sad lately. This year was kinda insane, the pregnancy has stirred up a lot of memories, my mother pulled a lot of shit so I went no contact with my parents, and of course my extended family got involved and it became a huge thing.

I couldn\u2019t stop myself from compulsively counting it. Sometimes this stuff is just hard to live with. \n\nIdk. I just needed to get this out somewhere. I\u2019m not really telling anyone about the stairs because it\u2019ll probably just be an excuse for people I don\u2019t want to talk to to try to wiggle their way back in.

He replied immediately, happy to hear from me, asked where I was at the event. He was by my side within the hour, giving me a huge hug, saying he was glad I reached out. We walked around through the massively crowded, he led the way and turned to ask if I was ok, as he knows I have really bad anxiety around huge groups of people. I nodded and he held his hand back for me to hold. He's never done that before, nevermind in public. He then said his friends were there and he wanted to find them (I've never met them) and I stopped and said \"are you sure you want me to come with you?\" He said \"yes of course!\" And led me to them.. introduced me, first time in almost 2 years I met his friends. We all chatted a bit then his friends were going another direction and he again choose to stay with me.\n\nWe went off to a quiet corner to have a heart to heart. He blurted out he had been on a couple dates lately... weird, I didn't even ask so why tell me that?? I said \"oh ya, how's that going?\" He said \"well I'm seeing her again.\" I was so confused as to why he rushed to see me, walked around holding my hand, then decided to tell me that?? I was about to say \"nice to see you, I'm going to go..\" because I was so annoyed but then we just ended up sitting and having a huge talk about everything that happened between us.\n\nI blurted everything out and just ripped into him about how shitty everything made me feel, the shitty things he said and did to me, how he was a death sentence on my self-esteem and I never understood why I was never good enough. His eyes welled up in tears when he saw my pain and he apologized and said he never meant to do any of it on purpose. That he is just a broken man, fucked up. (he had two failed relationships before our \"situationship\" and claims it's why he cannot get serious with anyone right now.... he's broken and doesn't trust.)\n\nAnyway, we both cried, let everything out. I felt it was a turning point. Like maybe he missed me and now he was finally opening up and I was starting to understand why he is the way he is. Long story short, he went in for a passionate kiss, I yelled at him some more, he gave me his coat because I was cold, then we went home together and had the best sex we've ever had. He slept over, cuddled throughout the night and in the morning when we woke up, kissed me goodbye.\n\nAnd here we are, a week later and I've heard from him ONCE. I know he's on a date tonight (we get to be pretty good investigators round these parts) and I'm feeling absolutely completely stupid and heartbroken for falling (yet again) for his shit.\n\nWhy would he act like everything I said about him hurting me hurt HIM?? Act like he felt awful and never meant it? It seemed so sincere, but then he just goes and has this crazy passionate night with me then fucks off on me again? WHY???? Why do that to someone?\n\nI've since blocked him again everywhere but my heart is shattered and I feel so stupid.

It definitely had an impact on my life, and it always will. \n\n9 years old, playing in the living room floor. Mom sitting on the couch watching tv. Waiting for her entertainment while I craved entertainment from her. My back was up against the couch, I had to be as close as possible in hopes that maybe she would have to acknowledge me. Maybe she would tell me to move or maybe just maybe she\u2019d ask to play with me. Although this would never happen my heart would race at the thought of the attention that I have craved for my entire life. You would think after 9 years, a boy would give up. Not this boy, his mom is all he has. No father, no siblings, just his mom. While she was always around she never was available to me. The only way to get attention was to act up, this became my new game. If I did something deliberately wrong she would have to acknowledge me. She wouldn\u2019t have a choice, she can\u2019t ignore me if I catch something on fire. She would have to yell at me, and she did. I enjoyed it entirely too much, at 9 I would rather be yelled at then spend another day in the living room floor, hoping, pray for the slightest attention. Mom would stare blankly into the television making sure she didn\u2019t catch my eye. she wouldn\u2019t dare look me in the eye, this would make her uneasy. She knew I craved for her to mother me, but she knew she didn\u2019t have it in her. She wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye, the guilt haunts her to this day. As I play with my toys in the living room floor, I would be both the good and the bad guy. I didn\u2019t have a choice seeing there was never a soul that wanted to play with me. Many times I recall playing board games with myself, I was extremely smart at a young age and it was my favorite past time. Have you ever tried to beat yourself in checkers? When you have your next moves planned out for both colors. One thing that I never did was beat myself, i refused to lose. I used to think if I beat myself I will never get to win, I will always be a loser. This ate at me, the kids at school knew I was a loser and made sure I never went a day with remembering that. At age 9, I needed glasses but \u201cwe couldn\u2019t afford them\u201d due moms money being spent on meth. I couldn\u2019t read the board in class and everyone, including the teachers, just thought i was mentally challenged. In 4th grade I decided that if played retarded at least the teachers wouldn\u2019t be mean to me anymore. I could handle the kids but having a grown woman ask you if you are stupid isn\u2019t easy to process at the age of 9. On top of that I noticed that the children that were retarded had their parents bring them all the way to the classroom, I thought this was finally it! My mom is going to spend 30 minutes a day walking me to class. Boy was I wrong, I have played mentally ill but \u201cmy feet weren\u2019t broken, so i could do this myself\u201d. Between home and school i just wanted attention. Playing in the living room floor was all i had to look forward to, every morning I woke up, this is the day! my mom will lose her blank stare into the TV. Every time I was filled with disappointment because this never happened. In the middle of playing with my toys almost every night there would be a knock on the door. I knew it was time. A man or multiple men, every once in a while a few girls would be standing at the door step. My mom would look back at me and give me the look. I knew what the look was but I put up a fight every time. The tears would come crawling down my face, I didn\u2019t want this to happen, I just wanted my mommy. The strangers would all acknowledge my existence, I assume just to ease their conscience a little bit. They knew the drill as much as I did, walk in, take a right and take a seat on the bed. Let the mom deal with her screaming kid. After putting up my best fight every time, I would lose. My mom didn\u2019t care to calm me, she just had to get past me fast enough to get in her room and lock the door. Some times I would lock on to her leg and beg her to not leave me alone, others i would just stand in front of her door. The result was the same every time, slam, lock. I am now alone, even with people in the house, I am alone. Countless thoughts raced through my head each time, why am I not good enough? what did I do to deserve to sit in my own silence, that i did not create. What caused the most pain was hearing the happiness that came from inside the bedroom. Even from my mom, the joy that radiates through her voice was a joy that a 9 year old boy craved. It hurt every time and it never got any easier. I would try different things to be heard like pretending to fall and get hurt, no one came to my rescue. I know they heard me though, their guilty silence ate through the walls of the house. My bedroom door had an old style key hole and I would peek in to see what I already knew. Everyone was sitting on the edge of the bed, a few glass pipes to be shared. and of course the countless amount of lighters. every once in a while someone would bring a needles to give out shots, while this was different, i knew i got shots at the doctor so I was happy that everyone was being healthy. I stared through this peep hole almost every day for countless hours. Waiting and waiting for my time. Mom was going to come out and everyone would leave! This is my time to be with her, as usual I was disappointed, often times she would walk to the couch and be asleep before i could even try to sneak a reason for her to tell me goodnight. This was my daily routine, play, crave, cry, crave, sleep.I never once blamed her for anything, it was always my fault. I wasn\u2019t good enough, there was nothing I could do to make her proud of me. Since positive attention was not possible, I had to result to even more tactics. Home alone was my favorite movie and daily I waged war on the meth crowd that frequented my home. A few cut tires and I think she started to catch on. JUSTIN WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING!!  Finally my craving was being satisfied she said my name, context didn\u2019t matter to a 9 year old me. I just wanted to be acknowledged. You can only be invisible for so long before you wonder if you really even exist. I once poured rubbing alcohol on the door and lit in on fire, I was 9. I wanted to be forced out of the home by my mother, maybe even she would show that she was worried. Wrong again, as my door to exit my door was in flames and I screamed for help no one came. I had yelled fire too many times before. I knew the only way to make it was to put in out myself. I did it, at age 9 i put out a fire with my blankets while my mom heard me scream from only 8feet away. I had one last trick up my sleeve, I put my super soaker squirt gun up to the key hole and let loose on the crowd of zombies on the bed. I hear the door swing open and with joy I turn to see my mother, finally i craved this. I was shocked, it was a man that I had not seen before, he cocked his hand back and smacked me in the mouth. I never felt such pain, he left and I laid down in my bed. The hit was so hard that I didn\u2019t want or crave anything from my mother. I just wanted to be in my room alone where I was safe. She didn\u2019t do anything about it and it was the last day that I tried to change the course of my daily routine. From this point forward I would play in the floor with my toys still hoping for my mo not join me. But now when the knock hit the door I was already in my room. I would push my football toy box up against the door and I wouldn\u2019t dare look through the key hole. I would play with myself until it was time to take a bath, after bathing I would lay in bed and fall asleep. In the back of my head I always wished that my mother would step in and kiss my forehead but as you can imagine this never happened. At age 9, you could say that all of my needs were being met and I was being taken care of. But this doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t impact the rest of my life. Neglect exists in many ways, more than the eye can see. That recreational drug use you claim doesn\u2019t effect your children, effects them more than you will ever know. You cannot provide a good healthy relationship and use drugs. PERIOD.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

That was one of her many justifications for cheating.  Well it turns out the 5 years she waited for me to marry her was nothing compared to having to wait 10 years for the guy she cheated on me with to officially marry her.  I say officially because they had some sort of off beat ceremony that declared them married by a religious man supposedly right after I left.  I learn now that the ceremony was not recognized by the city, state or any law due to them never having gotten a marriage license.  They were officially married in the eyes of the law after she waited on the other guy twice as long as she waited for me.  At least my excuse was telling her to wait after I graduated college.  Anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe divorced the guy 5 years later.  Took the house, alimony, child support, half his retirement savings, car, college tuition and what ever else that wasn't nailed down.  I here she can't afford to maintain the house she got.  Taxes are killing her and once her alimony is up she doesn't earn enough to stay there.  She dating again.  Why not.  Good for her.  Some lucky guy will be over joyed to have a woman that passes one man's child off on another man to raise.  She's still full of shit.

I love him, I dont know why, but regardless this needs to be my final goodbye.\n\nHe lost his license due to a 3rd OWI and I was back in his life because I was the only one around.  I have been driving him back and forth to work for 6 months now, and things were actually better than before.\n\nBut now he has new friends, and once again I am simply the crazy woman who cannot handle us being \"just friends\", and wont let him have a life of his own.\n\nI have no friends in this town, my kids are about it.  I suffer from social anxiety and depression but am in therapy and on medication.  I have a job I love which gives me a purpose.  But without him I do feel very alone.\n\nI cant do this anymore, I told him for the millionth time he needs to find a new ride to work and back (it will be tough), and of course here I am \"threatening\" him instead of being a good friend.  I told him I simply cannot be around him because it hurts so much.  He doesn't listen. His favorite line is \"I didnt do anything wrong\".  \n\nMy girls are gone this weekend and I told him earlier in the week I would like to hang out.  He told me today he had an \"event\" this weekend and when I pressed he said maybe playing tennis or go-carts or something with his buddy.  It's not that, it's a concert with several people from his work, who know nothing about me because I am nothing but a ride to him.  \n\nI'm sad, but this time it feels different. I deleted his texts and blocked his number.  When I started to feel sad about certain things I questioned myself \"why\", as they are truly things I want but dont get, like kisses and cuddling. They are just things i hoped he would do someday.  How can I miss and be sad over something that never was?\n\nI want this to be it, but I know he will be around without a solid ride to work and no supply that I know of yet.  We had a HUGE falling out last year and when his phone broke and I wasn't able to text him begging to talk and work things out, he showed up at my apartment to \"set the record straight\". \n\nI guess I needed to get a little out.  Now I'm kind of looking forward to this weekend.  I dug out an old book about controlling men and gaining myself back, and plan to actually read it.\n\nI feel oddly different.

He tried with another as well but she was already dating someone new. \n\nHe never tries for a third time, but he has gone for many second tries. My guess is because he wants something he can\u2019t have anymore and knows how to easily obtain it? I also know from his relationship before me (the one that he tried to go back to that was dating someone new) that their fights were similar to ours. He would talk about how she would scream \u201cyou don\u2019t really love me\u201d at him and how that \u201churt him\u201d. I never screamed at him, but there were many times I asked him \u201cdo you really love me?\u201d Because it did not feel that way.

He does have one ex from 2009 that he is still friends with and I always have found that weird, especially because he has always talked so poorly about his exes (and me) that I wondered why she was fooled by him?

From reading one of my old posts, I can see I\u2019ve improved but there\u2019s a ways to go. \n\nHey everyone. \n\nY\u2019know, I\u2019ve posted in here using different handles over the years (unless I\u2019m getting confused - there was a big crossover with a couple other subs). \n\nAnyway I\u2019ve got to thinking today about the damage my nex did to me and how it manifests itself. \n\nOne of my major issues at the moment is \u2018problem drinking\u2019. I don\u2019t mean boozing every single day, rather ending up out alone and drinking to the point of engaging in risky or unwise behaviour. It feels as if alcohol brings up a sort of \u2018bitter demon\u2019 that behaves in an extremely aggressive and unfriendly way. I often have flashbacks to things I\u2019ve said and done in this state and I don\u2019t recognise myself. It\u2019s usually around strangers so there\u2019s no impact on my day to day life, other than feeling absolutely terrible for it. \n\nI feel like this \u2018thing\u2019 is a manifestation of all of the hatred and revulsion I suppressed in order to survive. I really want to get rid of it, because it\u2019s going to get me into trouble at some point. There\u2019s only so long before you end up being reported for saying or doing questionable things, even if you\u2019re clearly drunk. \n\nI\u2019m not beating people up or being inappropriate around women, or anything like that, it\u2019s more a case of being a bit crazy. Saying things that are NOT my opinion, just to annoy people. Pushing boundaries. Being quite rude and abrasive about things because I felt I was treated badly. A psych would probably call it projection. \n\nWhat makes me sad (and that\u2019s in no way descriptive of the sadness I feel) is that before my nex I wasn\u2019t like this. I felt quite light. You know? I was someone who could make people laugh and never hurt a fly. There wasn\u2019t really a dark note there, sure I had a bit of an edge I suppose but it was benign. Just a bit cheeky sometimes, irreverent, I suppose. Nothing harmful to that. \n\nOut with the incidents I\u2019ve described I generally feel this low level weight on me. Like it\u2019s there all the time. \n\nAnd the hardest part is that nobody compares to the fake person she presented when she love bombed me. Nobody could ever live up to that ridiculous ideal image she crafted for me. I miss being loved like that. I feel that\u2019s one of the deepest cruelties of the narc. They sort of spoil it all, going forward, by making you feel like nothing compares to their fraud. \n\nI actually miss her, if you can believe it. I wouldn\u2019t tell my family that, they\u2019d think I was mad. But I do, I sit and think about her sometimes. When I meet new people, it doesn\u2019t seem to work, I wonder if they can detect that my mind isn\u2019t all there. But then it\u2019s possibly also because I\u2019m a husk compared to what I was. I know I don\u2019t look as good as I used to. You can see to look at me that I\u2019m low. \n\nI just need to keep it together. I\u2019m going back to university to complete my post grad. If one or two of you could tell me to hang in there I\u2019d appreciate it. It means a lot reading that, especially when it\u2019s coming from people who understand what we\u2019ve all been through. \n\nOne year and things change, maybe I can get back to who I was before.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My parents split when I was four and my dad had custody of my younger sister and I but let us live with our mother as we got older, assuming that we would have some questions and thought our mother would be best to answer them. My mom got married to another man when I was about 11 or so and this is what brought my world down around me. I'm not going to go into too many details, but I will say that until I was 18 I was the victim of physical, sexual, mental and verbal abuse. There was a lot of grooming to make me think that it was all normal and I didn't fully realize what had happened to me until I finally moved away from my mother. It's best to just say that my mother is just the most disgustingly entitled and delusional person that anyone would have the misfortune of meeting. She's the type of person you knew in high school and were sort of friends with but didn't really care about because she always seemed to get you into something you didn't want. That type of friend who would pressure you into taking 5 more shots than you really needed along with snorting 8 lines of coke while calling you a pussy if you tried to reject, only to chastise and talk shit behind your back and tell your parents, grandparents, preacher and who ever else you might respect all that you did if it meant saving her ass. A real professional liar that specializes in guilt tripping and victimizing herself. Hell, she could give most politicians a run for their money.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHer husband wasn't much better. A hateful, racist, homophobic angry drunk that only got worse if you ever dared to disagree with him. Basically a Karen but stands around 6 foot tall and is an iron worker. He'd either start a fight when he was drunk, or he'd get very.... Physical in a VERY inappropriate way. Don't worry, he got his. No, not jail time unfortunately. But he did have an accident at his work place that ended up with broken ribs, collarbone, several fractured vertebrae and both legs needed to be amputated. The way I see it, even if he ever gets to walk with prosthetic legs he'll be in pain for the rest of his life so I feel somewhat satisfied with knowing that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main issue is that my mother left her husband and got back together with him but didn't tell me about it until TWO MONTHS BEFORE MY WEDDING DAY. She had been with him for three months in secret when she told me. Which she did over the phone. While I was working. As an ICE CREAM TRUCK DRIVER. I think that was the moment that I knew I couldn't keep her in my life. Which now means I can barely visit my sister, nephew and cousins that I love dearly because I refuse to see her or be within a five mile radius of her pet pedophile. No one aside from my dad, who didn't know about the abuse until after I moved away, will actually reach out to talk to me without bringing up my mother and her husband or tell me that I'm over reacting. Even my in-laws want me to try putting more effort into having a relationship with my mother and have no problem telling me that. Where I'm from it's easy to hate a father for being abusive but it's never even considered abuse if a mother does it. I've been thinking about confronting my mother with what exactly her and her husband's abuse has done to me and force her to face her sins by going into graphic details of the night terrors I remember having, what my husband has to do to keep me from hurting myself or him when I'm having a night terror, all the years of self doubt and feelings of being subhuman along with the self harm and suicide attempts I went through for everything she did to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI want to tear down all of the walls I've made to keep her from seeing the scars I have from her choosing dick over her CHILDREN and destroying me to the point that I thought it was better if I would just die when I was only in SECOND GRADE. I want to show her everything she's done to me, then I'll show her what I've done to move on without her help or guidance. The only influence she had over anything I've become and anything I've gained in my life I got out of spite and hatred for her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, if I do confront her I might never see my new nephew when he's born. I might never see my cousins. I might never see the girl I spent three years of my childhood raising. If I finally do this, I might never be able to repair what few relationships I still have left of my family. But if I don't, the night terrors may never stop. I might never get answers for why she did all of those things to me. She has heart problems and has been planning her own funeral for around 8 years now. I feel so lost an confused. I want to confront her for my own sake, but I'm afraid of the risk that I might loose what little family I have left and officially become an orphan because my own blood didn't want me. I don't know what to do or where to go. This woman has caused so much damage to my mental state that I have a huge fear of having children of my own because of my insecurities that I might somehow ruin them like I was ruined. The only saving grace in my confusion is my husband. He helped me at my lowest moments by helping me first stop the self harm (I'm now going on 7 years clean), to taking me in when I was homeless, taking care of me, building up my confidence and showing me my own self worth. His unrelenting support has been the only thing keeping me somewhat level headed and I am forever grateful.

Well, 1,5 week gone by, he broke up with me when I had gone back to my crountry(Brazil) 3 days after my landing. Told me that he wanted to be in a \u201cnormal\u201d relationship with someone who owned their own place, date the person for at least one year, blah blah blah... \n\nWell, 3 days after I was dumped, I found out that my ex was cheating on me, 4 days after the breakup he was in a serious relationship with a guy. In this meantime, my ex gave me a hard time to give me back all my stuff, because he only wanted me to pick up everything from July, 1st, but I refused to accept his demand. He was not available anytime before, and I was like, what?!  Why?! I had to wait 7 weeks when I was in Brazil, why would I have to wait more 2 weeks in Canada to have my stuff back? I know that he was up to something! I told him that I was sure he didn\u2019t work 24/7. I got the police involved last week and got almost everything, he still kept my TV and other expensive stuff. Lied to the police that he had all the receipts, which is a lie! I was like, if my ex can easily lie to the police like that, even the police warning him about it, imagine what else he can do!!\n\nWell, last night, he posted on twitter that he was moving in with his boyfriend as of July 1st! So, he wanted to keep all my stuff. I was all the time right about all his plan!! \n\nHe wanted me so bad to believe that the breakup was all my fault when it was always about his needs, wants, and ambitious! \n\n\nI am so devastated to know that I was being used for one year! It\u2019s devastating to see all your plans to marry, have a family, have my puppies to be destroyed and made fun of by a demon like that. I had never met such a diabolical person in my whole life.

I packed all my things on the first of October along with my cat and left back home. Since then I been back once to the place to pick up my last things, it was in shambles and filthy to the core. Cigarettes everywhere with a smell of hate. Months after he asks me to come to court with him, he was being evicted.

I\u2019m currently trying to think what I\u2019m going to put. Ok, I met my \u2018bf\u2019 (I say that way as I don\u2019t think of him that way at all, I\u2019m planning my escape but I have a child with autism so I\u2019m tied to him at the minute.) 4 years ago. He messaged me on social media, we have friends in common. He was direct and funny. Not my type but I liked his sense of humour. I was also coming out of a relationship which is a whole other story. I was, looking back, vulnerable. At first he was great was very charming etc etc. But pretty quickly I realised he has a very jealous streak. Basically would accuse me of liking his friends. Once even freaked out and said I was flirting with a cab driver \ud83d\ude33 I left him eventually after him accusing me at his 30th party (which I organised) of liking his friend, shouting and swearing at me in front of all his friends. A couple of days later I found out I was pregnant. We decided to try and see. Cut a long story short the jealousy flared up again, I left him when I was 8 months pregnant. We got back together after our child was born. The child had a lot of issues including autism so without him I would\u2019ve went crazy (even more than he\u2019s made me) fast forward 3 years, the jealousy has mostly gone but there are other behaviours. I\u2019ll list them..\n\n1. He will shout and scream at me for the smallest thing, if he can\u2019t find something it\u2019s my fault. Literally roars. My neighbours can hear him and it\u2019s mortifying.\n\n2. Everything is about him and I mean everything. \n\n3. He will sit perfectly straight faced when he has made me cry (only happened an odd time, I\u2019m tough) \n\n4. The jealousy, although has majorly cut down but when he goes out he always hears \u2018rumours\u2019 about me cheating. \n\n5. Arguments. He will turn everything around on me and I mean everything. I end up exhausted from arguing with him. Every argument we have, even as simple as me nagging at him to pick up his shit escalates into a huge argument as he just basically explodes, he thinks him being louder makes him right \n\n6. After said arguments, he will text me when he\u2019s left for work or whatever all nice as if nothing happened. So I\u2019m still mad and will text him angrily, same with when he comes home he acts like he did nothing, whereas I want to talk or vent about it. He makes out I started it and he did nothing! I think he shows people texts to make me out the bad one. \n\n7. Tries to make out I\u2019m lying about things he\u2019s said or done, even when I have proof! It\u2019s like he\u2019s trying to make out I\u2019m crazy.\n\n8. Takes zero responsibility everything is someone\u2019s else fault or mine. \n\n9. Hates when I go out always makes comments. Or texts me using a loved ones illness i.e. \u2018you\u2019re a disgrace being out when my .... has &lt;illness&gt;\u2019 (trying not to give too much info away)  but he can stay out till 5am. Also uses loved one\u2019s illness to excuse his crap behaviour.\n\n10. Throws tantrums exactly like a toddler. Practically jumping up and down screaming. Will follow me about arguing till he gets his own way.\n\n11. Lets other people think bad things of me like I\u2019m controlling etc due to him twisting things. Also twists everything I say. He\u2019s basically starting a smear campaign against me and I haven\u2019t left yet.\n\n12. Threatens to kill himself when I say I\u2019m looking for a place. \n\nThis is all I can think of just now. I think I know the answer but I need to hear other peoples views. One thing I will give him is he is a brilliant dad. As I said I\u2019m getting out, putting money behind me as we are in his house so it\u2019s not like I can kick him out. I tell him why I\u2019m leaving explain everything and his answer is it\u2019s because He\u2019s fat and ugly and I\u2019m cheating. I\u2019m never out the door! Aargh! Anyway thanks for reading.

The only reason I don't commit suicide is because I don't want to shame my parents which is a mind fuck given that they have made me this way. well my mother not so much in that she didn't abuse me but let it happen.\n\nMy father was my abuser and i'am not talking about just being spanked or slapped once in a while, i mean full on beating with boards with turned down nails, continued beatings if i failed to cry or if i cried to much. i'll never forget the bruises he would leave on me and that fact he relished in them. An example of this is one of the memories that breaks me every time I talk or think about it. but here it goes. I cant remember what day it was but i can remember that I was 11-12 yo cause I was in the 7th grade. But anyways me and my bother(15) were in our room and had gotten into an argument over something mundane nothing big, no screaming or yelling just arguing. Well fast forward a bit and he goes to take a shower but leaves the radio on because he's hoping to record some song he had request the radio station to play, this was back in the day before the regularity of internet in homes, I'm currently 32 so this was either 1997 or 1998. But anyways I had forgotten this and as he was in the shower I turned it off as I was trying to watch Pokemon and the music was very distracting and annoying, so when my bother gets out of the the shower he comes into the room and gets upset that I had turned off the radio and goes and tells my father. And without a word my father comes into the room grabs me by the neck, pins me to the bed while on top of me and begins to slap me and back hand me with all his strength over and over until i'm screaming to the point that I cant breath and i'm pretty sure I blacked out for a second. Well anyways fast forward to the next day I go to school with bruises on my face and I didn't even know this until in gym a couple of friends asked me what happened to my face. So I go to the mirror to see, and there are bruises covering my face so I tell them my brother hit me while playing, so as to cover it up. To this day I can\u2019t believe not a single one of my teachers asked me or did anything about this. But anyways I don't say anything because fear of a worse beating if i say something and it gets to my father. Well anyways later at home that day i'm called into the living room where both my mother and my father are sitting he tells me to \"come here\" he puts the back of his hand to my face to see how the bruises matches his hand at which point he tells my mother \"I don't give a fuck let them come and get me\" and smiles. But they never did come for him and this is why I think death would have been better because knowing that there is no such thing as justice or reprisal.\n\nThere were beatings that left far more and worse bruises but that one day I will never forget because he was proud of what he had done and to this day has never apologized for any of it. i'll never forget when he beat me a board so hard that I had bruises on my butt and running up and down my legs and neither him nor my mom ever want to admit what they did to me and deny it anytime I bring it up.\n\nAnyways this shit has fucked me up for good cause i trust no one, I can barely even trust my girlfriend. I always think she is lying to me and maybe she is how the fuck do I know. I mean I know shes probably not but my sense of trust is so fucked I have no knowledge of what is normal.\n\nWanna know the fucked part, I give them money on the regular close to a grand a month to help them get by so that my mother and him don't go without. idk why I do this, cause I hate him so much but I know that just because I've been wronged by them doesn't mean that I should wrong them, but still every day I pray a semi truck runs a light and grabs me so that way I don't have to be a shameful piece of shit that put the gun in his mouth or tied a rope around his neck.\n\nMy girlfriend is currently trying to help me cope with all of this shit but I have a feeling that because of how fucked up i'am is only going to drive her away. And in that moment well we'll just have to see. Some of us are born to suffer and no one is entitled to happiness and well I just pulled the short straw on this go around.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

So my now ex bf and I have been together for a few months. He was jealous all the time, accusing me of cheating, ignoring me than love bombing me and our relationship basically consisted of fights and me crying because he would upset me or never make time to see me or put any effort in. But I still loved him because even though I was stressed and not really happy most of the time, being with him, seeing him could be just so wonderful and he could be so charming, loving and caring sometimes. \n\nI found out he had another girlfriend with who he has been for four years. He begged me to forgive him saying that I\u2019m the only one he wants and loves that he isn\u2019t able to live without me and I forgave him and we got back together. And it was great, he really made an effort and we made serious plans for our future together. \n\nWell turns out that he told the other girl the same stuff and was also with her again and so again a lot of fighting, crying and begging but eventually he picked her. \n\nRight now I am at a point where I am almost over him and don\u2019t want to be with him anymore and don\u2019t miss him that much. \n\nI know that it\u2019s going well with the other girl and she wants him no matter what he does. But something weird happened. He asked me if I would give him another chance and see if we could work out again. He\u2019s telling me he\u2019s serious about it and wants to give me some time but eventually he wants to be with me again and her he is telling that she shouldn\u2019t worry that it is just to hurt me because I told him that I don\u2019t wish him the best and that he doesn\u2019t deserve her and that he is just a bad person. It\u2019s been going for a few weeks now and I still can\u2019t figure out what his intentions are and what he wants and WHY now when it\u2019s all going good with her. \n\nI have to add that she and I are completely different. She is just accepts everything he does and doesn\u2019t fight with him or says anything at all. She just looks the other way. But I don\u2019t I can be really petty and I confront him with everything he does or says (that\u2019s also the reason why we were constantly fighting). And I know that he also loved me and he even said he is crazy for me. \n\nBut I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s just because he can\u2019t let go and wants me too or if I should be like plan b in case it doesn\u2019t work out with them. It just seems really weird because I even told him it\u2019s okay you picked her that is how it is just treat her better this time. And it is going pretty well again despite everything that happened.

She was amazed, we wound up together and became a so called \"under-cover couple\"... I allways felt kind of guilty knowing that she could be seen as ths \"cheater\" and I as a \"home wrecker\"... I never wanted to make a child suffer, and she told me that this is not the case, and that her \"home was wrecked already and there is no chance to repair it\", they stay together for their child only...\n\nFor God knows what reason I fell in love with her. I do get very attached and I lived the last year of my life just for her. Whenever I had the occasion I spent time with her, I cooked for her, bought books and toys for her child, and allways had this question on my mind: \"How could we be a couple and integrate our lives together\"...\n\nShe kind of avoided this question for a long time, saying that \"she does not make long term plans\" or \"we shall see what the future has for us...\"\n\nI was blindly in love with her and could not see anything else but her, from sunrise to sunset... we spent time together when she was working from home or when her child was on holiday at relatives... \n\nthe first time she broke up with me was when I told her that I have loved a girl 3 years before I met her but that girl left me and I felt unlovable and worthless ever since... she reproached me that \"I have already had the biggest love of my life and that she does not want to be second to anybody\"... I felt devastated... I was expecting sympathy but I got rejection for something that was not even true :/...  I somehow convinced her that it was not the case to react like this...but lately she started reproaching me that I have feelings for some other girl because \"I blush whenever she is around\"(which I could swear I don't) I do not have the remotest feeling for that girl, and I did not even notice her that much... she threatened me with a break up over this.. so I just ignored the girl.. I even got to the point where I was seeming almost rude without no reason to that poor girl, wishing in my head that she would just pass me by and not ask me how do I do whenever at work...\n\n\nShe told me that she does not want to be together anymore...of course I felt devastated, but I just haven.t had the strength in me anymore.... I told her honestly that it hurts me and that I can not hold on to her if she does not want me, although the reason she stated is far from reality... If I were to try and convince her anymore that I do not have feeling for another girl(when I clearily do not, and the only thing that worries me is our future together) I would break down psychologicaly... I even cryed on the street once because I could not take theese false accusations anymore....\n\n\nI kind of shut down emmotionally now...went to see a shrink and stopped talking to her...\n\n\nShe calls me up, we met and she said she wants to get back together. I just look at her and cannot not be in love with her...she is so beautifull... I just hope that she will understand how I feel someday...\n\n\nWe are now back together so to say... she still lives with the father of her child and tells me that she is not happy with me going out alone and is not willing to go out with me at least once a month after she moves out from her abusive husband.... she is also reluctant to meet my parents and she said that she will never want a child with me... \n\n\nAmong other things she said that hurt me during our relationship were: \"I don't care what you think\", \"I don't give a f#\u03a9\uffe6 that you cry when you miss me\"(for which she kind of apologised later, saying that it was about the context...)... aand...although she moaned with great pleasure and almost always used to tell me how great it was...that she did not stay with me because of the sex and that \"it is still long untill we will synchronise\".... \n\n\nI honestly wonder why do I still love her.?! She is so mean to me...and says that she does not see the thigns she did or said as mean.... I feel like nothing I could do or say would ever please her...

I'll post a tl;dr at the end. \n\nBack in September, my then boyfriend broke up with me, probably thanks to my NMom(which is another post for another sub).  I took it very hard and hurt him by vague posting on Facebook.  Around Thanksgiving, I saw him with the girl who would end up being my NCrush.  For the record, I'm a bisexual woman.\n\nWhen I initially saw them together, the wounds opened back up and I said some mean things about the other girl to a coworker.  Me, my ex, and NCrush were all working at the same place but in different departments at the time.  After I calmed down, I approached her and told her I wanted us to get along.  She seemed to agree to this, until a couple weeks later when she apparently caught wind of what I said in anger, leading to her to call me out in front of a coworker who had nothing to do with it.  She then started giving me dirty looks every time we passed each other, and parading my ex around my area.  \n\nFast forward to late January.  NCrush starts being nice to me out of the blue, and wants to add me on Facebook.  After some hesitation, I went for it.  Now, I'm sure that everyone who has Facebook knows those stupid instant games like \"OMG\" and the like.  One such game had presented NCrush as someone who wanted to take a bubble bath with me.  I posted it, leading to a \"lol\" reaction from NCrush and a comment that she'll \"wash my back \ud83d\ude1c\".\n\nWe did get into a fight because I accidentally sent her old screenshots of some conversation my ex and I had while he and I were together.  Things calmed down, and we had a very long conversation a couple weeks after.  It was around this time I started feeling something for her, which was the first time since my ex left me.  \n\nShe started telling me that she and my ex were having problems.  He was being immature and selfish, and not being helpful while she was trying to leave her husband behind for good by renting a new house.  Whenever I visited her at work, she'd always give me a big hug.  Now, my hands always rested right at her hips, to which she would giggle and tell me to go lower.  Another instant game led to a post about her owing me a drink, leading to her tagging two coworkers in it and her admitting that she once got drunk and flashed a handful of people.  She added, \"maybe j0sie95 would like to see my boobs too?\".  Rosa Diaz bisexual panic dot gif was my reaction.\n\nA couple weeks after she finished moving, she told me that she had broken up with the ex for good.  They had broken up six times beforehand.  I let her vent to me, after which I leaned in for a kiss.  She initially hesitated, then consented.  A couple days later, we passed each other as I was coming into work, and she gave me a kiss on the cheek.  We also started taking breaks together, but never a lunch together.  I also bought her a head wrap from Icing which she seemed to love. \n\nNow I have known that I'm bisexual since my late teens, but my mom, despite not being outwardly religious any more, is pretty damn homophobic.  I explained this to NCrush, who wanted me to come out so that she would be more comfortable taking me out.  She promised several times to take me out, but nothing ever came of it, despite her now living a mere five minute drive from where I'm currently living.  The only thing she ever really did for me was driving me home after we both got off work after my NMom never showed up to take me home. \n\nWe were affectionate for a couple weeks, almost a month, when she started to tell me that she didn't want a relationship.  While she kept being friendly to me, it wasn't the same kind of friendliness.  She claimed that she no longer regularly spoke to the ex, yet she started chatting him up one day when I was leaving.  When I asked her what was going on, she got defensive and threatened to block me.  Then she calmed down again and started being friendly.  Then she'd say that she would alternate between reuniting with him, hooking up with him, and being single and trying to get along with her husband.  AFAIK, she hasn't even started divorcing her husband yet.  They have two small kids together. \n\nI even gave her relationship advice while she was openly dating my ex.  And in between breakups with him, we had flirty conversations.  I never brought up a subject that she didn't bring up first.  I even promised her that I wouldn't pursue him for a long time if we were going to be friends.  She claimed that he made a hateful post about her on Facebook at one point. \n\nRemember that long conversation I said I had with NCrush?  I mentioned that I had my eyes on another coworker but I was reluctant to approach him because two of my favorite coworkers liked him as well.  She said she would vouch for me to him.  She also claimed that the two coworkers were spreading rumors about the two of us.  She unfriended me after she claimed that I was telling people that we were together even though I never did.  The two coworkers were her scapegoats.  I cut them off, which seemed to make her happy. \n\nI finally came out in mid April, which led to my mom losing her shit.  Thankfully, I wasn't kicked out of the house.  NCrush didn't acknowledge my posts until we saw each other at work, and only then did she congratulate me.  That coworker I was interested in?  She had him spend her entire shift with her a week later.  The next day, I watched her walk up to my ex and give him a big ol hug and kiss.  I could feel a mental breakdown coming, so I took some extra time off. \n\nShe promised that she would go see Endgame with my dad and I for my birthday.  She unfriended me and blocked me shortly beforehand, claiming she didn't want to be friends with any coworkers any more.  I didn't even get a text from her on my birthday.\n\nAbout two weeks after my birthday, she quit work, claiming \"too much drama\".  I checked on my ex to see how he was doing, and he was pleasant to me.  However, I never did tell my side of the story and I think that's what did me in.  The day after I reached out to him, he told me that there was a rumor that I was telling people we were back together, even though I made sure not to be seen with him at work.  NCrush then messaged me on Facebook, gaslighting me and telling me that she never talked shit about me, but admitting that she did try to get me in trouble for harassment.  She is now with the guy I tried to get with, and parades him around me whenever she is in the store.  AFAIK, she is still friends with my ex.  The good news is that I repaired my relationships with my two favorite coworkers.\n\nI guess what I want now is to clear my name with my ex.  I have apologized to him twice in the past and even wished him the best with NCrush before she became NCrush.  He's a very stubborn guy who doesn't like showing emotion.  He never looks happy whenever I see him.  I know that she drove a wedge between him and I for no good reason.  While it would be great for me to get back with him, I really just want someone to joke around with at work. \n\nTl;dr, got emotionally manipulated by another bi girl, who made the gap between my ex and I even bigger.  Now I want to set the record straight with him.  \n\nEdit: while I did delete our messages on Facebook, I still have a lot of screenshots that should be enough to incriminate her.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm not entirely sure where the line is crossed between discipline and abuse. But I do know that they are aggressive. My boyfriend was in an abusive home for the first little bit of his life, and has multiple family members working in Social Services. I have ADHD, ODD, and suspected Anxiety, so I'm not sure if my overwhelming emotions during those times had changed my point of view, but I'll explain it the most basic I can.\n\nFor example, my father has slapped me in the face multiple times, he's tried to sleep with me when I was younger (about 7 or 8, I would sleep on the floor and it ended thankfully.), has thrown me onto my bed (VERY forcefully), has yelled in my face about how much of a failure I am, beaten my 2-year-old brother (only once, thankfully. He's 4 now, but has Autism, but he was not severely hurt.) Has picked me up and thrown me, has beaten me (he says it's \"playing\" or \"teaching me self defense,\" but does not let me defend myself.\" and sometimes he gives no excuse at all), drinks about 4-5 cans of beer in one night, choked me twice, pinned me down to the floor twice, has threatened to call police on me for violence (I never hit, I only talked back after he had gotten me worked up) 3 times, picked me up and slammed me against my wall, holding me by my throat, unable to touch the ground or breathe while screaming in my face to stop crying when he was the one that made me cry, has made me do physical labor (running around with a log over my head with straight arms in extreme weather like heat/cold without proper attire) until I become lightheaded or dizzy and even after that he does not let me stop or get water, has not allowed me to eat/drink, and threatens to \"actually start abusing me\" if I tell anybody.\n\nMy mother, on the other hand, is much more verbal, but some of her punishments are physical. She has hit me, pinned me down onto my brothers bed for no reason, constantly accuses me of lying, calls me a b\\*tch, brat, sl\\*t, worthless, retarded, gay (I'm bisexual, but there's nothing wrong with being gay) (etc...) even though I make the Honor-Roll every semester/year and have never had sex. She, like my dad, has made me do physical labor, has not let me eat/drink, and also threatens to call the police or \"actually start abusing me\" if I tell anybody what they do, has grabbed my arm forcefully and dragged me, accused me of theft for stealing food when I wasn't allowed to eat, and when I don't eat I get in trouble for \"trying to be Anorexic and have a disorder I don't have\". She has stopped me from speaking to many of my friends, causing me to get bullied and destroy my self-esteem (I am much more quiet and reserved now, because of her actions) She threatens to send me to a mental hospital because of my ADHD and the fact that I used to self-harm (I was a year clean until today), does not allow me to apologize, but gets mad when I don't apologize. When I try to start a friendly conversation with her, she just yells at me or acts rude and tells me that I'm irrelevant, and that she hates me and wishes I were never born (sometimes I wish I was never born too, and yes I have been suicidal in the past, and I've gotten much better with help from my one friend and boyfriend.)\n\nI live with my grandparents, and they have threatened to call Child Protective Services on my parents. They are the nicest souls I have ever met, and I want to live with them instead. My boyfriend plans on calling Child Protective Services after begging me to call (my parents would act worse to me if they found out) since the start of our relationship since they would lose custody of me and my grandparents would be able to take care of me in the same house, but less violence and overall a better life.\n\nI really don't know if this is abuse, can somebody please clarify if it is?

He's been emotionally abusive most of those 10 years. I didn't recognize it as abuse and him as a narcissist until a few years ago. He's displayed traits of bipolar disorder this year as well to make things worse. He would go from doting on me to hating me and calling me all sorts of insults in just minutes. There was an incident earlier this year that was the catalyst to making him leave my house for good and it's been a roller-coaster ride every day since.\n\nI got to my breaking point last week after excessive disrespect toward me and threatening of physical harm that would end in my death. (He took the physical harm threat back later that night). Once he found out about the protective order I filed against him, the shit hit the fan as I expected. I didn't expect the type of retaliation he was threatening me with. But following his usual pattern, after raging out at me, he apologized and said he wasn't going to retaliate, that I deserve better, and that he was grateful for all that I've done for him over the years. His anger scares me even if it's not directed at me. He speaks in violent terms often, and I don't know what he's capable of especially if alcohol and pills are part of the mix. It's worth noting he hasn't actually physically hit me before.\n\nBecause of his criminal history before I met him, the content of the form I filed put him at risk for being imprisoned for a substantial amount of time.

I hadn\u2019t made any threats, I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. I was just trying to get my things and maybe see his son one last time. His new gf then found me on Facebook and told me to stop being crazy and messaging her bf. She said she would not hesitate to involve law enforcement and if my things were so important she would meet up with me somewhere and give them to me. She said I would absolutely NOT be coming over to his house. I didn\u2019t give her a response and just blocked her right away. What in the world had he told her? \n\nThankfully he lives 45 minutes away, but we have mutual friends so I have been back to that town a time or two. These friends have disowned him pretty much after they found out what he did to me. They saw first hand what I did for him and how big of a part I played in his life. Everyone I knew that was around us said I was the best thing that had happened to him and he should hold on to me. One of these fiends he has known since high school.\n\nGoing back to that town is a trigger for me. Too many memories and I\u2019m terrified of running into him somewhere. I know his son would come running toward me if he recognized me and my heart wouldn\u2019t be able to handle that. \n\n\nIt\u2019s been 3 months and the process has been slow, but the hardest part is for sure realizing that the person I fell in love with never existed.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I would appreciate any help or support. \n\n\\-\n\nI am 17 now, turning 18 soon. The abuse was by one of my brothers when I was still in primary school, and he is 5 years older than me. I don't have a specific age that I can give as to when the abuse happened (although I can calculate it because I do remember the grade I was in back then), because I don't want to link and associate the abuse to an age, I don't want to have all the good things that happened in my life in whatever age I was back then to be tainted and overshadowed by the abuse. \n\nAnyway, I won't be going into detail about the abuse because that's not what the post is about - I have never told anyone about what happened, and nobody knows (assuming my abuser kept quiet about it which I'm fairly sure he did). I've been wanting to tell somebody, anybody, about what happened for a long time - and I never have because I have not met someone who I felt would be able to take the news with respect. I trust several people - but I don't think they would react to the news the way I want them to. \n\nI've wanted to tell my parents before, but I honestly don't think that's a good idea. Our whole family is close, and I am still 'close' with my abuser. My parents are also close with my abuser. It is a complicated situation but first of all, I'm not sure if my parents would believe me since I have 0 evidence, and second of all, I'm sure it would cause them immense stress (and maybe would lead to health issues) even if they believe me or not. If they believe me, I'm afraid they would blame themselves. If they don't believe me, I will obviously be heartbroken and well, my relationship with them would be strained. \n\nI met a new friend 2 years ago, and sometimes we discuss news about abuse and she seems to be really compassionate towards the survivors. If I told her what happened, I feel like she would react alright. However, I'm just scared that she would feel defensive for me and tell my parents and fight for me which is thoughtful but is not what I would want. I am also scared that I would be putting her in a 'bad' position - she might feel burdened by this or stressed out. I feel like I know how she would react, but at the same time I don't. Will she feel so stressed she would tell her mum? And her mum would tell my parents? \n\nI REALLY want to tell someone because this has been kept to myself for such a long time, and sometimes when I have random episodes of thinking about the abuse in detail, I feel very alone. I don't know how to describe it, but maybe you all would understand what I mean. I'm also worried that when I tell her what has happened (if I do decide to tell her), I would appear emotionless which might be a bit weird?? Sometimes I cry like crazy when I think about what happened, but sometimes I just feel empty, lost, sometimes angry, and no tears come out. If I don't cry would she think I'm just making it up? I also REALLY do not want her to say BS like 'he was young and didn't know what he was doing' - he was 5 years older than me, and even I kind of knew that what was happening was wrong - and I also threatened to tell our parents in the middle of an act of abuse one time (because he was trying to further the stage of abuse) but he stopped and begged me not to tell my parents. I still wonder what would have happened if I did tell my parents back then. I suppose he would just deny it, and it would be brushed under the rug, because that's the easiest 'solution' for everyone besides me, the survivor. Anyway. If I go through the 'crying like crazy' route, I'd probably get no words out of my mouth as my emotions would run too high and I'd be too anxious. Also, what if she completely disconnects with me and asks me to seek help from a therapist instead and then proceed to leave me? I don't know how I would react if she did that. I also don't want her to replace all her thoughts of me with the master label of 'victim of abuse' - because I'm still the same person she knows. I'm so much more than a person who was abused. At least I want to be. \n\nShould I tell her what happened in person? (if so, where should I meet up with her - it has to be an isolated area because I don't want random strangers hearing me). Should I say it verbally? Should I write it down on a piece of paper and hand it to her? Should I text her? \n\nI also don't think I want to go into the graphic details of what has happened - I just want to tell her who my abuser is, and the main thing is that I want her to believe me, even though I don't have evidence. She has never met my abuser at all, so maybe it would be easier for her to believe me, because people that know my abuser would never believe he is capable of doing such things (everybody says he's better than me and more compassionate than me). He is super smart, he was a scholar, he acts nice, and he now has a high paying job. He had his first girlfriend a while back (they've split up now) and honestly I was really scared for her safety. Anyway I have gone a bit off topic, it's probably because this is my first time 'talking' about it even online. \n\nThe abuse will always be a part of my memory. But I don't want it to affect me anymore. I've just gone through exam season, and on 2 of the nights before an exam, I felt really anxious which somehow led me to think about the abuse which led me to stay awake until 4am. I feel like I want to take back control, and I feel like that starts with having outside support. I really want to tell this friend what happened to me but at the same time I'm really afraid to tell her. I feel like if I don't tell her now, I'll never regain the strength to do so. And I'm really scared of being a burden to her - I don't want her to overthink how to help me, I only want her to believe me.\n\nI think once I tell the first person, it would be easier to tell more people in the future. How should I deal with this? Should I tell her? If so, how? Thank you for reading all this, and even if you don't reply this thread, thank you for listening.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Until around Memorial Day weekend, at which  time, I was discarded.  \n  During the course of our relationship I had been introduced to his \u201cfriends\u201d but  I didn\u2019t go around them enough to consider them  \u201cour friends\u201d \n  When things started  to get real bad between us, I went and talked to his \u201cbest friend\u201d hoping that she could provide some clarity.  Found out today that,  that was a huge mistake.  I confided in her some of the crazy shit that I\u2019d been subjected to, because she genuinely seemed concerned. She shared with me some of the crazy shit that she\u2019d seen and heard  my ex do. Most of what I shared  with her she already knew bits and pieces that he had told her, of course he never told her the entire story. \n   She has dealt with sexual assault issues, a few times in her lifetime, and  I foolishly told her about an incident last year that  occurred between my ex and I.  Up until that point in time, I had not told anyone about this, and it wasn\u2019t until I talked about it that  I understood how fucked up the entire situation had been. After she and I talked and spent some time together, I almost considered her a friend until a few hours ago.  \n Apparently my narc-ex  had gone through and checked my reddit posts and comment history, and he found a comment that I made on someone else\u2019s post, where I talked about the sexual assault. He in turn shows her, and she tells him that I\u2019d told her about it, but that I\u2019d not told anyone else at that time.   \n I had lent her money earlier in the week in order for her to get a few groceries to get her and her family through until payday , which was yesterday.  I called several times and got no answer.  This morning she calls me and starts talking about  messages that I\u2019d sent the ex. And about the Reddit comment that he showed her yesterday.    I Drop what I was doing, and drive over to her house, because I\u2019m not having this conversation over  the phone when she is yelling and screaming in some language I  didn\u2019t understand. Going on and on  about me posting that he raped me on social media. ( also she isn\u2019t familiar with reddit) as if  everyone would know who I was talking about.\n  I show up at her house and we start talking,like normal people, and then the reddit thing comes up again and she\u2019s calling my ex to talk about what happened. \n  So over speaker phone he was being a douche bag ,right from the beginning.. and she\u2019s asking him questions , because apparently when he showed her the Reddit comment last night , he denied that it ever happened. \n  So she\u2019s saying to me that maybe it happened differently than what I remember.  she goes on to say  somebody raped her years ago and blah blah blah and maybe I wasn\u2019t remembering  it the way it actually happened.  She\u2019s getting louder and the ex is yelling into the phone that he\u2019s going to put a sign up in front of my house saying  \u201cI RAPED iFEELsadMAN!\u201d  I stood up and then she jumps up and grabs me by the hair telling me to get out of her house and leading me towards the door.  I told her several times to give me my money and I\u2019ll be on my way. She then proceeds to grab my car keys and toss them into her kitchen while yelling for her son to call the police.  \n   We tumble out of the house into the porch where she is telling me to get off her property ... while  I\u2019m telling her to give me my keys and my money and I\u2019ll be on my way.  So now we we\u2019ve got ahold of each other, rolling around on her back porch, on a mountain of garbage.  She let\u2019s go and goes back inside to call the police.  Meanwhile , I go and get into my car, and wait.  I wasn\u2019t going any where. \n  Once the heat shows up, they are back and fourth between her and I , about what happened , and they  are asking me weird questions, like did she know I was coming over, or did I just show up. How long have we been friends. Stuff like that.  Of course they are asking me what happened...\nI dunno what she told them,but I explained everything including the reddit comment.   Then they want to see it and I obliged. \n    For someone being concerned about a comment that ordinarily would have remained unconnected to either one of our actual lives and mostly Anonymous, she turns it into public knowledge.\n  I feel like she was insinuating that what I had told her wasn\u2019t the truth.  She said that since I told her about this, that she is unable to look at him the same.  I\u2019m not sure how that Is my fault.     My experience with  this guy really fucked me up, and for her to think that anyone would make up such a story, is insane.\n This and her willingness to fake befriend me makes me question her integrity not just as a woman, but as a human being . I think it\u2019s even more fucked up  coming from someone who claims to have been affected by physical, mental , and sexual  abuse.\n She told me that she knows my ex lies a lot.  She has told me about him being at her house while telling me over the phone that he was somewhere else doing something else .  She has told me about him lying about things that didn\u2019t need to be lied about.\nI think it\u2019s weird that she would want to make this shit public, just to get out of paying back the $50. \n   Now I have to chillax and wait for the police to return the rest of my car keys.  And they said they have a meeting with her tomorrow for some reason, or another.  And they will be in touch. \n\nLess than 30 seconds ago my ex called to ask me what happened. (He was still on speaker phone when the scuffle started)  I said \u201cyou heard it what do you think happened?\u201d \n So then of course he starts screaming into the phone and talking over me. I hung up. \nWhat the fuck is wrong with these people?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I had a second account (which i've now deleted) were I posted ads for men to dm me and degrade me. I sent pics, videos, audios, some really humiliating stuff. Some even still have those files of me and could use them against me if they wanted to. And now even the idea of them doing that turns me on. I even almost had several real life meet ups where I would be taken advantage of by multiple men at once. Thank god I was stopped by my now romantic partner. But I still think about were my life would've gone if they didn't stop me.  \n\nI've tried to convince myself that it just kink and pretend but I think it's actually hurting and affecting me. I've always had low self esteem and confidence problems, so maybe that ties into it. I don't want to feel like this, but in a way I must want this right? If not I wouldn't be doing it. I wouldn't have craved these men's attention right? I think i'm becoming addicted. I can't stop watching rough sex and misogynistic porn. I feel terrible and disgusting because it's the only thing that can get me aroused. And then when I feel disgusting it just makes me more aroused, it's like a never ending cycle of lust. The videos just keep getting more and more violent. Even though i'm with my partner i'm still having constant fantasies about getting raped and treated like i'm lesser. In public, whenever I see any man I can't stop imagining him taking advantage of me, I don't even have to be attracted to them, being completely dominated and humiliated is enough. It's really messing me up but I can't stop and now I don't even wanna be around males because of it. I hate these thoughts but it's what my body wants. \n\nI had a \"dom\" before I deleted my secondary reddit account and he still messages me. Saying things like \"deep down this is what you really want, a whore can't resist, if you actually didn't want this you would've just blocked me buy now\". Isn't he right? Why haven't I blocked him, why can't I block him, why am I listening to him, why can't I stop? It's been 3 days and he hasn't messaged me and now i'm missing him! I've reached out to him, asking is he still there! What's wrong me, i'm already in a relationship and i'm thinking about him. Is it possible to be addicted to and crave abuse? It just seems so unheard of, I feel like i'm disrespecting women who have actually gone through traumatic experiences.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

{"post_id": "c3ynv4", "created_utc": 1561260862, "title": "Should I tell my family about my past abuses?", "author": "zikezod", "self_text": "Hi all.  This is going to be a long post.  I'll post a TL;DR at the end, but thanks for taking a look at this either way.\n\nMy (27F) first abuse occurred when I was 11.  It was minor, but what I find most difficult about coping with it was that a) it was committed by a family member and b) 2 of my female family members watched while it happened and did/said nothing.  it's never been discussed or brought up since.  My grandfather was driving the car, I was in the passenger seat, and my mom (his daughter) and my grandmother (his wife) were in the backseat.  He began to talk about how beautiful I was and kept rubbing the inside of my thighs, brushing up against my groin.  He talked about he we would've \"sucked lips\" if we had gone to high school together.  I remember wondering what that meant.  I just sat still and silent and waited until we got to our destination.  Upon leaving our destination to head home, I ran to the car so I could sit in the back.  The three of them laughed about me not wanting to sit next to my grandfather.  While this was the first physical contact, this was far from the first or last time that he made me feel uncomfortable.  As a child, I never felt uncomfortable wearing a t-shirt and underwear as PJs around the house, or walking from the bathroom to my bedroom wrapped in a towel after a shower, even if my brother and my dad were around.  I stopped doing both of those permanently around 8 or 9 because my grandfather would wolf-whistle and comment every time.  I hurriedly dressed in the bathroom after every shower and dreaded when we went to the beach because I would have to wear a swimsuit.  Even when I wasn't in revealing clothing, he would compliment my legs or other parts of me, and I could often feel his eyes on me.  I will note that my dad and brother were never present during any of these instances.  Only my mom and my grandmother.  \n\nUntil yesterday I had accepted that I will just swallow my discomfort for the sake of some semblance of family harmony and have never told anyone other than my husband about it.  That is, until my mom told me that her first cousin (my grandfather's niece) revealed to my aunt (my mom's sister) that she had been inappropriately touched by my grandfather as a child.  My mom immediately dismissed it and said that she really has a lot of problems.  Now that I know this is patterned behavior for him, I worry about the future.  I don't have/want kids, but I know my brother and his wife do, and I worry about their future daughters.  I worry about my aunt's 6-year-old daughter.  I feel the need to say something to protect the girls in my family, but I am afraid of the backlash and I'm feeling really angry at myself for not being strong enough to protect them.\n\nMy second abuse occurred when I was 18.  I was raped by my then boyfriend.  I'd like to skip over the details of my rape/relationship in order to get to the point of why I wonder if confronting my family is the right idea.  My ex was a friend of my brother's.  He was emotionally abusive during and after our relationship both before and after my rape.  I tried to kill myself shortly after we broke up.  He spread vicious rumors about me in our small town on social media and would call me just so he could hear me cry.  My brother undoubtedly knew about all of this due to them having mutual friends and his access to social media.  We also lived together at the time so he could clearly see how upset I was.  What no one knows about in my family is the rape and my suicide attempt.  I didn't tell my mom because of how my grandfather was handled, and since my parents are married I feel like I can't tell one parent and not the other.  My brother still hangs with my rapist from time to time.  Invites him to parties, etc.  I know he doesn't know about the rape, but he does know about everything else and it seems particularly callous that he still hangs out with him, even though my ex has moved away and has pissed off most of their mutual friends to the point that he has very few in our hometown.  Again, the only person that knows about my rape/suicide attempt is my husband.  I've been wondering if telling my family about this will change my dynamic with them \u2013 I generally feel less loved and a lack of connection with them at times.  What I fear is that I won't be believed and/or that I will but my brother won't care enough to change.\n\nTL;DR: I was abused by my grandfather at 11, raped by my ex-boyfriend at 18.  I haven't told anyone in my family due to lack of support on their part and fear on my part.  Should I tell my family in order to a) protect other young girls from my grandfather and b) allow myself some sort of closure?\n\nThanks for reading.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I actually spent years sifting away through academia (I have a BA in Criminal Justice/Psych Sciences and I\u2019m doing a Masters in Law now) trying to understand, and fit the things that happened to me into some sort of explicable framework.\n\nFrom the outset it was grooming and he would push me to talk about sexual things that made me uncomfortable. He insisted on things like anal sex and deep throating which I felt uncomfortable with. He was pretty obsessed with porn, it\u2019s almost all he ever talked to me about. The first time we had sex, he talked me into unprotected sex. Then after I thought we were done, he insisted that I would just like anal sex if I tried it. I told him then and multiple times before that that I didn\u2019t want to do it. But he just disregarded my boundaries and had anal sex with me - no lubricant either because that was my fault if I wasn\u2019t turned on enough.\n\nThis set the tone for the rest of the relationship. If I refused him something, he\u2019d just growl and grouse at me. He didn\u2019t have to get physical or threaten me because I already had the underlying fear that I couldn\u2019t predict what would happen if I said no. Often, he\u2019d force me to have anal sex, probably because of how much it hurt. But generally, the rule was the more humiliating the better. \n\nI remember once telling him I was feeling suicidal. He responded that I definitely should kill myself, it would do everyone a favour. He\u2019d miss me though. I told him at times, I felt like he was abusing me, maying raping me by making me do things that I didn\u2019t want to. He said that I\u2019d *know* if he were raping me, and I loved it. I was just whinging for the sake of.\n\nI had to leave the state to get away from him. He threatened to kill me if I left, I guess because he didn\u2019t want to lose control of me. It\u2019s been nearly 20 years, and I have flashback so intense that I can feel him and smell him. I still want to kill myself every time they happen. In a lot of ways, my life has been ruined. I haven\u2019t had a relationship since, I really struggle with my mental health and I treat myself terribly because I don\u2019t think I deserve to live, just like my abuser said on more than one occasion.\n\nIt\u2019s been a bit of a comfort to realise that his behaviours fit really well into narcissism. But oddly enough, knowing that other people have probably experienced something like I have is pretty horrible.\n\nIt\u2019s left me feeling like if I can do something well, it must be easy and if I can\u2019t do something then obviously I\u2019m a failure. I have bulimia now, which developed to help me cope, so I often feel like I have to \u201cearn\u201d my food.

We became friends and now we are more than friends but we are not and haven't been in an exclusive relationship at any point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis guy has a narcissistic abusive ex girlfriend. She spreads smear campaigns about him, me, his family (saying he is a violent rat, I am a crazy stalker and his family are all child abusers). I've seen her be physically rough with him. When they were in a relationship she isolated him completely, first making him cut out his friends that she didn't approve of but the extent is so bad that he hasn't properly seen or spoken to his own parents or brothers in over 3 years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe problem is, she isn't done with him. She goes through regular cycles of hoovering and discarding every month or two. She comes back, tells him that their breaking up was all a mistake, he disappears for a week or so (he isn't allowed any contact with me when she's with him) and then eventually she discards him and then will make no contact for a few more weeks until it starts all over again. Especially now that she has realised that I exist and that when she's not with him there is somebody new he is sort of seeing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt took me a while to clock that she was a narcissistic abuser. He always believed (and still does) that she is actually the sweet gentle person she pretends to be, and that every thing else is just a result of her traumatic past. He thinks he has a duty to be there for her because it's not her fault and he loves her. He thinks that the lies she tells are not lies but delusions - that she genuinely believes them through paranoia resulting from her traumatic past rather than because she is manipulating, gaslighting and smearing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince the last hoover and discard I've finally found out about narcissistic abuse and I've started to give him information I've printed off the internet about it (he doesn't have internet at home). I've watched dozens of youtube videos, all the Vivian McGrath, Dr Ramani, Angie Atkinson, etc. I can see everything they are describing in the situation with my friend and his ex. Since I've started telling him about it he says he can see it too but he just can't get his head around the idea that she isn't the person he thought she was and that everything has been a lie. I think part of him knows what I'm saying it true but part of him wants to keep believing that she is just very fragile and damaged but is deep down the sweet person she pretended to be at the beginning and during every hoover and love-bombing phase. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout this time, though, we've been growing closer. During the longest period of discard, he said he was beginning to fall in love with me. But every time he goes back again his feelings start again at square one so now he doesn't have those same feelings. But he is making progress. He's started acknowledging that she isn't healthy for him. He met his dad for a half an hour talk and even sent him a text message (Happy Father's Day) for the first time in over 3 years!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I want to know is: How can I help him finally see and accept the truth? From your perspective as somebody who has been through this, how did you get out and how can I help him get out? What can I do to help him stop going back every time she hoovers? And finally, and this is a very selfish question, will he be able to love me back or is her hold on him always going to be too strong?

I haven't yet joined any groups or communities or had therapy, which I plan to do, but in the interim I thought I'd come here and speak to people that may have this lived experience.\n\nThere were a few red flags, but in the beginning we were so deeply and passionately in love, but within a matter of months things started to become volatile. It started off small - he called me an idiot every now and then, pulled me by my hair to stop me from leaving, then begun to escalate: during fights he'd called me fat, lazy, boring, used something very personal and traumatising against me, said I wasn't sexually worth anything because of how I looked and my age, I had no ambitions, needed to lose weight, had too much body hair, would scream he hated me and wanted me to die, and on and on and on, during which I was mostly quiet which only angered him more (I totally shut down when it comes to violence and abuse, learned from childhood). The physical abuse became him hitting me across the face and kicking me while I was on the ground. He'd cry after and express remorse, after one instant I went into the bathroom and slashed my wrists (the wounds were benign but he was still really freaked out), but he later used this as proof that I was abusive too (I had become immune to risk/violence at this point and was gesturing I wanted to get out). In between these moments I'd jump when he'd slam a cupboard, or bite my tongue instead of making suggestions, but we also still had a strong connection and a lot of affection - we would talk about philosophy all day - he is a self-described philosopher and wanted to be a writer. As the months went by, I was the only one working/paying rent, and he'd be either at home all day or at uni. Financially it was really difficult, I had no time or money to myself AT ALL, I didn't feel feminine, he became insecure and paranoid that he relied on me fully (I believe he has genuine psychosis now, but his insecurity could have been remedied if he had gotten a part time job, I even paid for him to get his resume fixed up etc. In fact, I consistently supported his dream of being a writer, encouraged him to set up a blog, happily listened to his rants, and put my own dream of going back to uni and overseas on hold because we needed money for rent obviously. There's no doubt how much I sacrificed for this guy, I just loved him so much, but he resented me because I'd be tired after work and didn't do anything interesting and was wasting my writing talents. He took it as a personal insult that I didn't \"aspire\" for anything (I did, but my soul was hurting due to abuse and we had no money). Escalating still, during the fights he slams me against the wall by my throat, hits me across the face, tells me he's gonna kill me, kicks me in the back, and cry afterwards and say he loves me. During the last month, he confessed he'd cheated on me several times, and to this day it keeps me up all night, I have nightmares about him with other women and how I feel so worthless sexually. He broke up with me, took his things and left the apartment in shambles to live with a \"woman\" he met on Tinder (I left the apartment for a \"break\" and he was bringing women back there within a day of me leaving, worth noting he never paid a cent for it and it was technically my apartment). Before he cut all contact with me he was cold, told me he hadn't loved me or been attracted to me for a long time and implied he'd met another woman and he may be in love with her (he wasn't but wanted to hurt me). This is really everything in a nutshell.\n\nI go back and forth, trying to dissect all these memories and reconcile them, but there's too much - the hitting, the cheating, the put downs - where I genuinely don't know who I am anymore. I feel so alone, unsightly and worthless. I'm trying to immerse myself in heavy theory/philosophy, poetry, writing, exercise, meditating, etc, but I am just being assaulted with memories every day and trying to put everything in its place, what I possibly did wrong, what I could've done differently, etc. He has a whole theory about how memory isn't real, etc, and is good-looking enough to have woman after woman in his life (which also makes my stomach turn when I think about it). I just wonder if there's anywhere to \"start\", what should I actually do to stop torturing myself? I just remember everything, I question myself, I wonder what he's thinking.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She and I had been friends for 15 years; since college. But through her friendship I lost most of the friends I had made in college (I know, I should have seen that as a sign). I noticed I could not have a deep meaningful romantic relationship with someone because she felt threatened. My friend felt that my attention should go to her and only her. \nWhen I got my first real job out of grad school and called to tell her about it (not an undulating thing to do with a friend) she told me she couldn\u2019t really be happy for me because she didn\u2019t have the same kind of opportunity, even though she is an actor and I\u2019m a teacher; two very different careers with two very different measures of success. \nI could go on and on, but it would bring me back to that place that I just got myself out of. The last 2-3 years of our friendship, I felt like I was walking on eggshells around her.

I was too young to remember how long it was going on, but I do remember it happened so often that it felt like a daily routine. Something like a chore.

We're not problematic in any ways really, besides our grades, which aren't the best, and we desobey her often, nothing big, but also something we should probably not do. But the issue that causes the most problem is defending ourselves. For a while now, since perhaps 12th grade, I've started to point out aspects I realized and thought weren't correct about my mom, and especially since I've been living abroad, because things she does that arent't correct become more clear. I'm actually begun to be pretty defiant when defend myself or other members in the fam, but mostly because i feel like the way to fix the disfunctional family is to actually deal with it.\n\nHowever, my mom is a very complicated situation. She's really against any kind of defense or any defience when it comes to trying to express that something you don't agree with. She tends to get really agressive and violent when either of us try to defend ourselves. She'll also constantly be talking and spiting us and kind of prompting us to talk, and when we do she uses it as an excuse to be violent again. And she tends to lock herself away in her room after this not allowing any sort of communication. When this happens she also tends to threathen that she'll sedate herself, in fact she actually allegedly does, and uses that against us. I feel like a lot of these behaviours come from the fact that she's a judge and as such doesn't really like being talked against, no matter how calmly, and there's a lot of misplace authority. Yes she is the mother and kind of the head of household but I'm not sure that's an excuse to behave the way she does. There's a very dictator like vibe with my mom.\n\nNow, here's why im really worried now. Today, i arrived from my latest semester abroad and almost immedietly her and my sister got into an argument about something ridiculous, and it escalated into more violence and then i interviened, whenever I thought I was going too far, which made her mad at me as well. I think she feels victimized and disresepcted when I do this, but i've just trying to have a fair attitude. The problem is that I'm worried for my sister, that revealed today she's been having suicide thoughts and what i believe is a lot of pressure for a 14yo. There's a lot of things she said that make me worried, especially since I absolutely relate since I also fell into depression, suicidal thoughts and other similar stuff with my mom being a big source, but I really dont want this for my sister. I think there's a lot of emotional neglet at play here, which I think my mom justifies by showering us with a well-off life. She doesn't realize the harm she does i think because she does a lot for us monetarily, and usually uses that as an excuse and an argument to how she's a good mother.\n\nI realize this situation is very complex and there's a lot unsaid, like my father and a lot of other issues but I'd like some advice. Should i contact a social security worker, child protective services, a therapist for my sister or my mother, is there such thing as family councelling? I'm really unsure and have been trying to take these issues into my own hand by continuously adressing my mom's issues and putting my foot down, but I think this got a lot more serious and I think I might need professional help. What happens if I do call protective services?\n\nAlso, there's the issue that my mom is a judge, and a big authority. There's been a situation before, where she really violently hit me for putting my foot down and not leaving the house like she told me, after an argument, only because I thought a talk woul'dve more productive. During this fight, she bit me, ripped my clothes and hit me in the head with a cane till I was actually bleeding from it, and proceeded to call the police as a strategy to get me out of the house. The police did show up and eventually the situation was \"solved\" (like always i end up having to pretend apologize for my own sake), but the police did see me, clearly beatened up and BLEEDING, which shouldve been a huge red flag for abuse, but nothing happened? Im afraid that as a legal authority, anything I try to do wont help (corruption, fear and shit).\n\nHelp?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I am feeling really confused about the whole relationship and it\u2019s like a mist has lifted and I\u2019m slowly starting to feel horrified that what I experienced was something to do with narcisstic abuse. \n\nSome info; we met when I was 21 and he was 33 when I was really vulnerable, coming off another extremely physically, sexually and emotionally abusive relationship. \n\nIn the beginning, I wasn\u2019t very keen on him. But he was persistent and I was hurting. Certain things gave me red flags; excessive, expensive gifts, a pressure to go serious very quickly, and him telling me how successful he was when cracks started appearing (he really lived with his parents and his job was at his father\u2019s business)\n\nI stayed. Please don\u2019t judge me. He was very supportive to begin with, a best mate. I thought we could move slowly, I don\u2019t know. \n\nI broke it off with him when bigger cracks started to appear: he said he was going to do lots of different things but never followed through to work or move out, he had pretty degenerate friends, he white lied a lot it seemed about friendships and work stories. It was always someone who screwed him over, not the other way around. Or it was his dyslexia which meant he never got ahead in life. \n\nFast forward, I go to university. He pressures to move down there with me but I won\u2019t. This was for me and it was nothing personal. He loses it. \n\nFrom uni onwards, it\u2019s been resentment. Slowly gets more controlling but insidiously: he tells me everyone is out to hurt me and I need to be colder, more controlled, not drinking, being careful of sharing myself with people. I isolate myself a lot, snap at my friends heaps, push everyone away. \n\nEvery time I get a great work opportunity, he\u2019s outwardly supportive but says he resents me working away all the time. I go to China for work for 3 weeks, he says everyone says I\u2019m selfish and a bad girlfriend. \n\nHe gets more aggressive, shouts at me a lot, blames me for making him mad...if he wants to do something, we have to do it, but not vice versa. His family aren\u2019t very nice and don\u2019t treat him nicely, but it\u2019s my fault for not making an effort. When I say I don\u2019t want to have sex, he wheedles and touches me until I give in because I would snap at him otherwise and I know it will cause an argument. He threatens to leave me all the time because he knows I have abandonment panic and it gets me back in line. Goes through my phone when he feels like it. Took pictures of me naked without my consent: \u201cyou give your body to everyone else except me.\u201d\n\nEven if I wear nice makeup and clothes, I got \u201cyou look so good and I just look like shit\u201d, as though I should\u2019ve looked daggy to suit him!\n\nFast forward. I have a huge job coming up. He comes to my parents house for dinner, all nice...I go off for this job, he goes mad at me for calling him on a night out. Says I\u2019m controlling. Says he doesn\u2019t want to speak to me. I wait up all night, sick with worry because I heard girls\u2019 voices. Next day, he texts me saying he wants a break and blocks me and not to contact him. \n\nI text him off my mother\u2019s phone telling him it\u2019s over. NC since and all I feel is relief and like I didn\u2019t know this person at all. \n\nI\u2019ve had a lot of therapy, I\u2019m a strong person...I don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t see all this until now. \n\nWas this narcissistic abuse? Or am I just a codependent mess and he\u2019s a typical abuser? Or are we both just awful people....An explanation for this would help. I know it sounds bad, but I feel like I\u2019ve been sleeping next to a stranger for three years. And I didn\u2019t even realise.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I've learned so much about myself and about how I'd been so broken to allow someone like him in my life. \n\nI've learned I need to accept that I had an abusive childhood. A Narcissistic family that reduced my self worth to nil. That I never had any self worth because I was never taught how to love myself...or how to self soothe.\nHe came along and gave me that kind of love and support I never knew how to provide for myself and I was so relieved that I'd finally found what I thought I was supposed to be looking for. But then devaluing happened and that was taken away along with any sense of identity I thought I had.\n\nBut I've learned that I'm a fighter and I worked on learning how to provide that love for myself. Because expecting it from someone else makes you vulnerable, and while I expect love and respect from any person I now allow in my life, I am self sufficient enough that any such contribution from an outsider is now an addition, instead of it being a vital source.\n\nAfter him I almost became entangled with 2 other narcissists. But I got out as soon as I figured it out. Before him...I would've stuck around, made their problems my problems and tried to make them \"better\".

Please be kind and understanding- this story does not include physical abuse for those who are sensitive to that. I will be using made-up names, of course. (I am female btw).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will try to keep this as short as possible. In February of 2018, I made a horrible mistake. Let\u2019s call him Peter. At first, we were friends in one of our school\u2019s clubs; we both helped lead it and spent time together because of that. I was drawn to him because of his.... passion, I guess. He was very outspoken about what he believed in and was intelligent enough to be in the gifted program that I chose to drop out of. We were able to hold high-level conversations and he made me laugh. The red flags, while there, were small. At first, he was very good at controlling his behavior. Eventually, we started dating and all seemed well until about 3 months in. Going into the relationship I knew he had depression; who was I to judge... I had it as well. However, I did not know that he had deep family issues that would cause him to be emotionally unstable. Peter started being short with me and he expected me to help him through everything- even when I couldn\u2019t *(ex: drop your family dinner to help me stress about \\_\\_\\_\\_).* I told him I did not like this behavior and if he continued it, I would have to end things. And that\u2019s what I did; however, I did want to remain friends. My mistake soon took its toll. He did change. A month or so later we were back together... a few weeks in he turned the tables. Apparently, ***I*** was a horrible one. Asking him to change toxic behaviors was hurting him. I know it sounds ridiculous, but he had a hold of me. My heart can be bigger than my brain- and it was then. I told him I was sorry.\n\nTwo months later I was literally checking my phone during soccer tryouts for him. ***Always. On. My. Phone.*** Once I took a 40-minute nap instead of a 30 and I got yelled at, cussed at, and belittled for over an *hour*. He called me names. He cut people out of my life. He controlled me, even got me to stop wearing makeup and start wearing clothes he liked. A big issue is that I am a busy person. Sometimes I would get stressed about it and because he was now one of the only people in my life, I turned to him. He found it insulting that I was stressed about things that \u201churt him\u201d (because they took time away from him). He would go into every discussion already deciding that he was correct. He would always turn me into the bad guy and I always apologized even if he was the culprit.\n\nBy the end of our relationship, we were \u201cfighting\u201d almost daily (he was yelling at me and I lost the will to speak back at this point). He would yell at me loud enough to send me into a panic and he would do this in public. He had no fear. He had the control. He would slam his hands on the table during lunch, screaming while I sat nearly silent. Everyone else was silent.\n\nI finally stood up one day. \u201cYou\u2019re treating me like shit, and I don\u2019t have to deal with this.\u201d I broke up with him that day. Little did I know what this would do... I don\u2019t know if this part belongs in one of the revenge subreddits, to be honest. I didn\u2019t do anything to make this happen, though.\n\nEveryone turned on him. Everyone. The entire debate team, that we were part of, some of his \u2018friends\u2019. Everyone. I didn\u2019t say a word, but because he verbally assaulted me nearly every day in the hallways of school, the student body collectively decided to shun him. In this way I am very lucky. I am lucky that I was believed. However, I also had screenshots to prove the emotional/verbal abusive happened regularly from him as well as brain scans proving that my neuropathways had taken a toll. He had me convinced that it was my fault.\n\nHad it not been for my new best friend, Oliver (made up name as well), I may have never come out of this.\n\nBut...\n\nMy old best friend. I lost her. We were friends from the time we were two. He cut her away, but she decided to stay away. My self-esteem was low. He had taught me to hate who I was before him, and I\u2019ve spent every day of these past 5 months trying to bring her back. I\u2019ve started to make new friends. I go out to get-togethers (big no-no with Peter). I wear makeup again. I dress how I want. I\u2019ve had a few setbacks. Peter had Asperger (very high functioning autism with high intelligence for those who don\u2019t know) and because of this, a few people have said that it was my fault for breaking up with him because I was \u201cdiscriminating\u201d. That one hurt- set me back a few weeks.\n\nI needed to get this off my chest to people who wouldn\u2019t judge me. I gave everything to that asshole, and I am ashamed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:   [Update here](https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/cltflg/an_update/)", "subreddit": "abuse"}

That\u2019s a lot to get into, but I had my own fault in that ending. \n\nAbout six months later I met her, we had seven to ten incredible dates, I was absolutely enthralled and hooked but I had a confidence in myself. Which is super rare for me to have real confidence, not just faking it until I made it.\n\nTwo weeks after we met she broke up with me, it was cold and calculated and cruel, and it stung, but in my mind - her loss. She had decided that I \u201cwasn\u2019t the one\u201d and that she had found that person already and wanted to \u201ctry again\u201d with him. He was wealthy and good looking and \u201cin great shape\u201d and \u201cEnglish\u201d with two kids. She told me these things. \n\nSeveral weeks later, she called me back and we had a fight because she wanted to get back together with me, because the English guy had cheated on her. \n\nWe were together for months, and we kept fighting. Usually about the lack of sex we were having. The first time it happened she freaked out while I was actually trying to be intimate with her and she cried and fought with me because she didn\u2019t know why we weren\u2019t having sex enough.\n\nWe had sex two or three times a week on average. Often much more. \n\nShe\u2019d always accuse me of cheating on her or talking to other people, literally any contact with a woman that wasn\u2019t her was cheating. I had to cut off some of my friends. That sucked, but I thought this was real. \n\nWe fought again and we broke up. I begged her back because I don\u2019t know, and she agreed, then ghosted me and got back with English guy. \n\nTwo months later she\u2019s fighting with me about a relationship I had with my friend who I called pet names. Sweetheart and darlin\u2019 and pretty basic stuff. I made a plan to get coffee with her purely as friends and kept it from my abuser, because I was terrified of her being mad at me. \n\nShe has two kids of her own. She separated from her ex-husband very shortly after he had stage 3 lung cancer. They \u201cfought a lot\u201d, she says. I never saw them argue even a little.\n\nWe fought every two or three weeks. It was always her getting angry at me over some imagined insecurities like \u201cI\u2019m porn addicted\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m chatting with other women\u201d, I wasn\u2019t. At all.\n\nI was always loyal and honest. At some point I started lying to her and fighting back and being just as irrational and nonsensical as she would be. I turned into a horrible version of myself that I really hated. \n\nRecently we went on vacation and she fought with me for six days, then came home and fought with me again because we weren\u2019t having sex. We had fought and were totally fake with each other for six days on vacation with the kids. We shared a hotel room with them.\n\nShe came home from work the next day and was tense and quiet. I made her a nice dinner. We watched TV for two hours. We went to bed and she fought with me immediately because we weren\u2019t having sex. She had at me, really nasty, sarcastic and angry ... I was actually trying to be with her, cuddled with her, out my arm around her and her heart rate spiked and she freaked out and started fighting with me because I spent two minutes playing a game on my phone in full view of her. \n\nI lost my mind. I said every hurtful thing imaginable. She threw the engagement ring at me and I just screamed at her to get out of my house. I tried to physically remove her because she wasn\u2019t going to move. I didn\u2019t hit her, but I tried to carry her out.

I regret what I said and what I did. I shouldn\u2019t have done that ... but I didn\u2019t know how else to make it all stop.  \n\nSince then I\u2019ve tried to not be in contact. But she still has things here. The contact I\u2019ve had to have has been minimal and precise and she still turns it into how she\u2019s the victim here. That she didn\u2019t want this. That she\u2019s homeless, she\u2019s staying at her ex-husbands house that they co-own with him and their two kids. She keeps making plans to pack her things without notice and I have to leave the house for her to do so, because she\u2019s said she doesn\u2019t want to be around me privately.\n\nToday I tried to set a boundary and asked her to arrange time with me in the future. She started immediately telling me:\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t what I wanted. I don\u2019t have time otherwise. I have to be home for my sons birthday. \n\nDon\u2019t date anyone. Stay single for a while. Don\u2019t do this to anyone else.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s always a projection or a twist back to me. It\u2019s always my fault. Always and entirely. I feel like maybe it is and I just don\u2019t know it. \n\nBecause when I asked about making arrangements for her to pack here she said she thinks I have someone else over. \n\nI never even came close to cheating on her. Ever. I never gave her a reason to even think I would. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m lying to myself. She keeps telling me I\u2019m crazy and I\u2019m the abuser here and she\u2019s defending herself. \n\nI keep telling people I trust and love that this is happening and it\u2019s as if no one understands or believes me.\n\nI\u2019ve even reconnected with old friends who are wonderful. One of them is smitten with me. She\u2019s been giving me natural compliments and flirting and making plans to be with me and it feels amazing and wholesome and normal. A huge part of me is thrilled but I don\u2019t want to fuck it up. I keep waiting for the other show to drop. \n\nI feel so fucked up.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

because my mom says she isn\u2019t and my dad says he isn\u2019t but i just, i don\u2019t know. sometimes i think they must be right and i must just be making it up, i don\u2019t know why. but i know what has happened did happen.\n\nthere\u2019s not a lot of it early on i can genuinely remember, so i think it started relatively recently. i\u2019m 16, f, for reference.\n\ni was always a pretty miserable kid from my home environment. when you saw pictures of me when i was younger, there was like, maybe 2 total where i looked happy. when i was younger, maybe 6 or 7, i remember my dad forcibly trying to get me to go to my room and dislocated my shoulder in the process, but other than that, just constant spanking/occasional slapping from my parents was the usual and that\u2019s not all that bad i guess. \n\nthe real bad stuff started when my parents got divorced i think. the timeline still feels a little wonky to me because maybe i\u2019ve blacked it out? i don\u2019t know.  that was maybe 3-4 years ago, honestly can\u2019t remember. sorry my concept of time is so fucked.\n\nthis is when the emotional and physical stuff was getting bad. i won\u2019t go over every circumstance throughout the past few years because honestly? i can\u2019t even fucking remember most of it. but i\u2019d say it reached it\u2019s worst when i was 15-16. \n\ni guess the most mundane is the constant yelling from my parents when i don\u2019t even do anything wrong despite me picking apart every little thing i do. i go out of the way to make food or something from my mom and she screams at me for waking her up. i do little things to try to appease the maniacs that are my parents but every single time it ends in me in trouble, in pain, etc. being called lazy because of my depression, a pig, a rat, by those surrounding me in my family. \n\nbut there\u2019s the physical stuff, too. despite me being a relatively good kid (my only problem bein school and my depression) my parents only seem to attack me in this way (and the mental abuse stuff too, i guess?) today my mom threw hot food at me for asking her to knock before coming into my room (after many circumstances of her walking in on me changing), would drag me by my hair, threw me to the ground and pulled me up again so hard she ripped a portion of my shirt off, etc. \n\nbut i think the worst part was the night after i turned 16. i hadn\u2019t had my room cleaned and my alcoholic father was drinking, and those two things combined equals trouble for me. long story short, after slamming me against the wall, yelling at me, etc, he was choking me, only doing what i would assume was to kill me. i called the police on him. that was one of the hardest things i had ever done. it was so scary. the police officers did nothing because since it happened so quickly and his girlfriend pulled him off me i didn\u2019t really have any bruises or anything to prove it.\nhe\u2019s long since kicked me out, about 3 months ago i think, so i don\u2019t have to deal with that anymore, i haven\u2019t seen him in a long time. \ni go to therapy for my depression but my mom doesn\u2019t allow me to take pills because i \u201cdon\u2019t deserve it\u201d and gets mad at me when i self harm and i can\u2019t go to a psychiatrist about my assumed adhd  and haven\u2019t been to the doctor in forever no matter how sick i get so maybe that\u2019s medical neglect too idk\nhonestly there\u2019s probably more stuff i can\u2019t remember just because i genuinely block it out.\n\nand luckily for me the abuse didn\u2019t even stop at my family. i had an abusive boyfriend who would threaten suicide and controlled me so much (then stalked me online for 1.5 years after, this is still going on but doesn\u2019t affect me as badly anymore.). \n\ni don\u2019t know. i really wanted it off my chest because i feel like even though people know bits and pieces i\u2019ve never told it all together and maybe this is to convince myself that i\u2019m not crazy and that this really is abusive and i\u2019m not just dramatic about small fights i don\u2019t know anymore. i can\u2019t help but feel like it is my fault because i\u2019m the only one in my family who gets abused (my best friend suggests it\u2019s because i\u2019m the smallest, physically and mentally [im in a  house of almost all 6\u2019+ people while i\u2019m 5\u20192] and i guess that could be true but who knows). \n\ni guess that\u2019s all. if you read it thanks, you know my story as it is for now and i can feel a little better.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He has very few friends, so if I want time alone, or with other friends, I have to be the one to initiate it 100% of the time, and I feel guilty the whole time. When I return, he\u2019s aloof and it\u2019s uncomfortable in the house for the next couple days. He\u2019s basically subtly punishing me for doing anything without him. He has never once in our 12 years together said \u201cI\u2019m gonna catch up with my friend for a few hours this weekend\u201d to give me the opportunity to have some alone time without feeling like I had to initiate it. \n\nI explained this 3 different times, in 3 different ways and watched him either \u201cmisunderstand\u201d me or invalidate me each time. He insists that his reaction after I spend time with friends is in my head, because he \u201chas no problem with it\u201d. He finally said, \u201cyou know, when you talked about your ex in the past, you always complained because he would disappear for weeks at a time and now you\u2019re hitting me with this news. It\u2019s hard to tell what you really want.\u201d Clearly this grown ass man knows the difference between ghosting someone for WEEKS at a time, and needing personal space, but he\u2019s trying to make it seem as if my boundaries are ridiculous. I just sat there, straightened my posture, narrowed my eyes, looked him in the eye and said simply, but confidently, \u201cIs it really though?\u201d\n\nThe change in the power dynamic was palpable and I saw him lower his posture, gaze, and volume. He admitted that he doesn\u2019t actually HAVE a lot of his own friends and he DOES feel bad and pout after I come home. He said he never does anything without me because he thinks we should want to do everything together. He literally admitted to all the problematic shit he does/thinks without really realizing it. \n\nHe suddenly went back to normal and brought up an unrelated issue that he was mad at me about, and the moment was lost, but it was incredibly validating for me to feel that power shift and that budding assertiveness within myself that I haven\u2019t felt in years.

He truly only cared about winning and not me or us. I never should have trusted him. I\u2019m more angry with myself for doing so much for someone who clearly valued so little of me. One of the hardest lessons to learn by far. I still wish him happiness and hopefully change.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

And both of us have sleeping issues so alot of the times it would be like all throughout the night, we even talked on days we were so busy that we only could just text.

And I was hurt and fucked up but pretty much in shock so I was just like \"I- I get it. You don't feel things normally. I understand.\" but I stopped responding after that but they continued texting me, and I ignored them for an entire week and it was insane to see how- they just texted me about normal shit and like \"aw i wish you were responding i'm watching colby brock and jc\" and like it DIDN'T EVEN OCCUR TO THEM THAT WHAT THEY SAID WAS AN ACTUAL PROBLEM\n\nAnd for a few more days I didn't look at their messages but I picked up my phone and saw two texts basically saying \"woah- you haven't been talking and I'm honestly so concerned something happened. i keep thinking about your health, did something happen? just please respond.\"\n\nAnd after that I basically sent them a long paragraph about how I won't be treated like this and that I can't do this anymore (it was really never something I thought would happen.) and I just went completely no contact whatsoever, i didn't even wait for a response.

Soooo.....I\u2019ve spent literally hours and hours reading posts here from people who have gone through what I just survived. Three weeks it took me to do anything more than pretend my way through the days any way possible because of my four children. The first entire week they all spent around me on the bed and we watched movies, they used their tablets, played X-Box etc because I couldn\u2019t even move from the nausea. Guess that\u2019s how being broken really feels. For almost a year I had been with this man who had me wholeheartedly convinced he loved me, I was the last person he\u2019d ever love, yada yada. He brought his three kids and moved in with us because I was already a SAHM to my 4 and he was raising his 3 children alone. The two mothers that belonged to the children both ended up on drugs and had abandoned them years prior. So I went from 4 children to 7. I loved them immediately and became their mother-figure. I picked everyone up after school and basically began the single parenting shortly after. He would start coming home from work later and later and I was having to cook, get baths, do all homework, etc and get them in bed by myself 75-80 percent of the time. I had dinner waiting when he got home. Red flags were all over the place that I actively ignored because i was so in love with this man. But he never asked me about my day, acted interested in what I needed, he always wanted to just talk and me listen mostly. I didn\u2019t mind. Four or five months in he started being on his phone when he was home more and more. He would constantly throw insults about me being on social media too much while he himself was on there as much or more than me. He actively friend requested people he said to \u201chelp his business\u201d but it was 90 percent always an attractive woman. The one time i jokingly said something he said I was being crazy and reacting because of being cheated on before. Two months ago he REALLY changed. He changed his phone passcode and when i asked about it he flipped his shit and wanted to know how I knew. Well, because I saw him typing it in and it was obvious immediately. And i wasn\u2019t even looking for that i was just sitting beside him when he opened the phone one night and it wasn\u2019t hard to notice. Of course he had to lock it because I picked it up one night and saw a Snap from a girl with hearts and shit that he of course yelled at me about for the entire night so it was my own fault he had to lock the phone now. Okay. He had never been one to like my social media posts it was very rare. My pictures especially any selfies he would never react to. But he would like selfies and make comments on post after post that other women would put up. It hurt my feelings but i knew saying something would be the worst thing. He started selling this diet supplement that is marketed mostly to women. Well then he was spending hours and hours on his phone messaging women about it and telling them to come by his shop to get free samples. Of course he would always post pics of himself doing something \u201ccute\u201d and was even sending some of them flirty selfies that literally had zero to do with the diet pills he said he only talked to these women about. Wouldn\u2019t you know the ones he talked to most were young and \u201cattractive\u201d by their Facebook filtered pictures. He spent so much time obsessing over this diet pill business pyramid scheme thing but it was just a cover for him to get the attention of all these women. He is a handsome guy but charismatic so that women respond to him positively over social media when they\u2019ve never even met him and they just fawn all over him loving his posts etc. He stopped letting me tag him in anything period. And if i dared ask about it he would say i was trying to fight and argue and flat out REFUSE to even talk about it. Then out of spite he would sit there by me and just do it even more. He got a motorcycle that he then obsessed over and stayed even later at work working on. I was here being mom to seven kids and not any of my emotional needs were met and my need for physical touch got nothing. He would complain if i wanted to have sex more than once every two weeks by then and said i was too needy and made me feel like a pervert or something for literally craving his touch by that point. Two weeks ago he called from work and said he was leaving there in the RV and going to this huge concert called Rock the South for the weekend. Said his work buddy was going too. Didn\u2019t hear from him till Sunday afternoon when he called puking up blood and asked me to meet him at the shop and bring him home. He ended up in ICU after I got him to the ER then they transferred him by ambulance at 2AM an hour away. I thought he was going to die and was literally a basket case. I was at the hospital with him a few days and even brought him home when they let him go. He posted selfies from his bed to social media about it all and not one time did he mention me. I am the one who never left him and the one who dressed him and made him go to the ER. He talked about his kids and his mom coming to see him but this man made me completely invisible to everyone while i was actually sitting right there! I found out later he lied and nobody went with him down there that he just took an RV to go by himself?? To a rock concert and just disappear only to reappear deathly ill 24 hours later? He will not explain anything further about going except to say he didn\u2019t cheat on me. Zero people who have heard about him going believe that period but I really tried to even though I wanted to puke every time I thought about it. And then just gets pissed and shuts me down if I try to question further. Says I\u2019m acting crazy and don\u2019t love myself. He left and moved his kids and himself out the day i brought him home from the hospital. Crushed his kids, crushed mine and literally broke me. A few days later he left for a family cruise for over a week now and got back today. During that time i nearly died here of grief and loss and have been in therapy trying to find a way to deal with this. My therapist suggested I read on Narcissistic partners and discarding and that\u2019s how i found this sub. He has refused to text me or talk to me the entire time he was gone till after about 5 days he sent me a selfie and wanted me to see him posing shirtless and cute with cornrows he got on an island!? I had gone all that time not looking at his social media because I knew it would have killed me then he blows my phone up and the only thing he has to say really besides to tell my son he\u2019s proud of him for winning a baseball game...is look at my cornrows? I still have not seen him but I did text him last night and tell him some pretty mean things about how horrible of a person he has been to me and now i know it doesn\u2019t matter. He will never see himself as anything above a good looking amazing man who does nothing wrong and will not admit he\u2019s been fucking around the past two months. He said I am paranoid and crazy from past relationships and need to work on loving myself. I can say that I\u2019ve daily been feeling much better and have finally started seeing this man not as someone who ever loved me now. I almost died of grief and he didn\u2019t even message to check on me. He\u2019s got no telling how many other women\u2019s attention now and I simply just don\u2019t matter. It\u2019s been horrible and hurtful but now it\u2019s survivable. These stories from everyone else show me that these people are literally so much alike in their behaviors it\u2019s actually fascinating. I felt like I had lived half of these stories. I\u2019m glad this sub is here. It could be the difference in a person dying of shame and blame or learning for the first time it actually was never their fault because they never would have been good enough. That realization makes all the difference. It still hurts like nothing I\u2019ve ever experienced, but there is so much more out there waiting for me. I was always worth it and I know one day I\u2019ll love someone who will love me back so hard I will be horrified to think this is how I wanted to spend the rest of my life.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I hate using the word \"molested\" me.. because it wasnt really anything like that (that I can remember now) but often made inappropriate comments or would.. There were a few times he had asked me to undress in front of him, I was smart enough to say no but that didnt stop his attempts. We lived in a house with a lot of people and 1 bathroom, so when someone was showering it was common for another to use the bathroom. While I was bathing one day, he came in and tried peaking over the rail, knowing who it was, I hid myself, but he just stared. As I got older and we moved out, he'd visit and many times he would sit in our house, on a very visible chair.. pleasuring himself in front of me and at times my step sister. When I came out about it, I went to therapy once or twice then didnt go back and I'm not sure why. I dont think I wanted it.. but after that, nothing happened. I was forced to kind of just sweep it under the rug and hold back my feelings and still have to be around him when I'm at my grandparents.

I'm both happy and sad she blocked me. On one hand, her blocking me proves I got to her. It proves I did end up getting the last word and showed her that she can't hurt me anymore. On the other hand, she didn't try to reach out via Twitter. She went straight to blocking me which if she really wanted to contact me that was her one opportunity to do it. \n\nShe hasn't used or made a Twitter post since I had her make it over a year ago meaning she only went on to look me up and I guess also block me.

There's just been so many instances, it makes me feel ashamed of myself. I feel ashamed for not being stronger, not being able to say no, not knowing how to feel or move on, not being able to do literally anything else other than freeze up and cry myself to sleep. I'm 19 by now, and I feel like the sheer number of instances it's been happening is just ridiculous. I feel like maybe I'm purposefully putting myself in these positions. I feel like **I'm** the problem amongst many other things. \n\nWhen I was 7-8 and lived in CA, my mentally ill uncle would watch my then 3-4 y/o sister and I, but at night he would molest me in my own bed. After about a year and a half of it, he moved out and I didn't have to deal with him again until we moved down South when I was 9, and we stayed with my mom's oldest uncle (my mother had 6 brothers) , while the mentally ill uncle coincidentally was also staying with him. He continued to climb into my bed early in the morning to touch me, kiss me, even almost rape me at a one point (thankfully my mom came to the rescue by coming home early). This went on until I was done with my 7th grade year, so I was roughly about 13 years old I think. \n\n\nAround that same time when I was still 7-8, another uncle was having a wedding going on and my cousins were staying with us. She convinced me to sleep naked with her and would touch me in weird places. Fast forward to a summer later and she made me make out with her, let her touch me, hump me, and vice versa. \n\n\nAround my freshman high school year, an upper classman who lived a few houses down noticed me and grew a liking to me. He was the worst abuser by far. He forced me to hold his hand on the bus, told me lewd things and would constantly ask for nudes. He even told me one time that essentially I was lucky nobody was around other wise he would've taken me to the woods behind my house and raped me.\n\n He sat outside my house for hours and hours on end until I would talk to him, even if I didn't want to talk to him. He was everywhere, always passing me notes and drawings and trying to give me gifts that I was always declining. Eventually my aunt let him live with us and the abuse was every day just about after that. He would force me to sit on the steps in the backyard and do what he wanted with me, and I was too scared of him and what he would do to my family if I ever said anything. He would harm me, cut me, choke me, bite me, pin me down in positions I wasn't flexible enough for, punch me, black mail me-- one time he bit my nipples so hard they scabbed up and didn't heal for weeks. He knew I had a boyfriend and would keep going anyways, making me choose whether I wanted to be his \"master\" or \"slave\", and when I said neither he \"chose for me\". Eventually it got to a point where he was fondling me on the bus in front of people and nobody would bat an eye. He offered my body to \"play with\" to one of his friends who thankfully declined. He was dangerous. When he finally got detained he was only detained for a day. A good amount of people didn't believe me. I could go on for hours what he did to me, but sadly the abuse didn't stop at him. \n\n\n\nMy first boyfriend pressured me into giving him nudes. Mind you, this was going on during my freshman year too. I would bend over backwards to make sure he was sexually pleased, even if it meant compromising my own mental health and self. Eventually my mom found the nudes and he was angry at me for him getting into trouble. I was suicidal between my own mom calling me a whore and a slut and everything in between, my step dad calling me a \"porn star\" and promiscuous-- telling me I can't have male friends at all because I'll want to fuck all of them, and him for completely and outright ignoring me all because his precious PC got taken away for the very nudes he pressured me into giving him. \n\n\n\nI had my third boyfriend in my mid sophomore year all the way to mid Senior year. He was talking to another girl from out of state, and I gave him my virginity as a way of keeping him with me. He would sometimes talk about thinking about other girls when I wasn't around and put up a single persona when I wasn't around. The group he was in was so toxic, he eventually started neglecting me for them and continued to talk to the out of state girl to impress them. Days together would basically consist of maybe two hours of watching a show, 8 minutes of sex, and then we would be with the boys. Just about everytime we had sex he would finish, piss, and leave me to masturbate in the back seat of the car while he drove me home. I had to eventually break things off, and it was a pretty messy break up that had me jumping into a rebound relationship with my exroommate/ex boyfriend. Of course that isn't his fault, it's mine. \n\n\n\nWhile I was in a break period with my third boyfriend (this was around November of my senior year by now), I had recently started getting closer to a guy I had choir with. He was nice, but not very popular due to his looks and personality. We ended up clicking, but he ended up catching feelings for me later on. I told him that I wasn't able to reciprocate them, since I was on a break with my at the time boyfriend, but I was more than happy to stay friends. Sooner than later he became possessive of me, started telling me that he wanted our hangouts to be worth it and that I owed him. Eventually he ended up touching me in his media room while we were trying to watch a movie. I told him it was getting close to my curfew and I needed to get home. We get into his car and he hopped on top of me and reclined the seat all the way down and shoved his hand down my pants. I freaked out and couldn't even look at him, let alone keep telling him, \"I gotta go home dude, please I gotta go home.\" in the loudest voice that I could muster which unfortunately wasn't any louder than maybe a mouse squeaking. After a good 10 minutes he finally took me home, dirty talking to me the entire time.\n\n The next morning he freaked out, and I told him that it wasn't okay, but maybe we could try some petting so I could forget about what happened. He agreed and said that he was comfortable with whatever I was comfortable with and we could stop anytime. I strictly told him no sex and no kissing, and those were the first two things he wanted to do. I told him no sex and the first thing he says is, \"what if I put it in anyways?\" and I immediately told him to stop and that I wanted to go home. It was another half an hour before I could go home because of his lack of orgasming, so I had to awkwardly sit next to him as I was crying while he finished himself off in the drivers seat. After a while he told me he was frustrated that he wasnt \"getting anywhere with me\", telling me that I was broken due to being molested. I cut things off with him as soon as I read those words, but that didn't stop him from pestering me to talk to him. I tried my best not to lead him on, but other people said otherwise. \n\n\n\nAnd finally, my most recent encounter: my exroommate/ex boyfriend. We clicked really well, but the relationship was not good at all. He would ridicule me in front of friends and even when we were alone sometimes. He would guilt trip me into staying or doing something for him because he had depression. He would ask where I was going/who I was hanging out with and what time I would be home, then get mad if I responded I didn't know. When we would argue he would always yell and make me pay attention to him when we would argue-- blowing up my phone with texts, calling me, showing up at my work to \"talk\". We broke up, but still lived together afterwards and it was a huge mistake. He would grope and have sex with me while he thought I was \"sleeping\". I would always freeze up while he was doing it, but usually would try to covertly avoid the situation by moving away so he couldn't put it in. Any time I would move, he would jump back to his side of the bed and when he thought he was good, he would try to go at it again. I never knew how to feel about what he was doing. I still don't. Saying I was raped doesn't sound right. I didn't want it, and he was under the impression I was asleep, but it doesn't sound right even if that's what happened. I eventually moved out after a fight gone wrong and I brought up a single instance to see what he would say-- he only admitted to one instance and said it was only for a few seconds, when I know for a fact that there were multiple times and he usually finished. I cut him off yesterday after he guilted me for being depressed and needing time away from him because of the \"once instance\". I feel more guilty than ever. \n\n\nI just feel like something is wrong with me. I feel like a living sex doll. I feel like being used is my purpose and nothing else. I feel like maybe I bring it upon myself sometimes. I'm 19 and have been used and abused by more people than I can count on one hand. I've been through all of this, yet I have had a disgusting masturbation addiction since I was 10. I have sex often with my boyfriend, and usually I feel fine afterwards, but other times I feel like I'm no better than a cumrag. It's hard to get through life feeling like I'm the cause of my own pain and suffering. I'm already depressed and suicidal as is, and sometimes I get a little too close to the edge than I like. I feel like a lump of worthless meat that is going to rot on the side of the road. I am exhausted. Sorry this is so long, I really just needed somewhere to vent because I am so tired of being angry and hurt and I'm tired of dealing with this trauma. Thank you.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I\u2019m a week over four months since I left him after almost 22 years and I realized that anniversary went unnoticed! At least for a week! \n\nI know four months isn\u2019t much and I have a very long way to go so I\u2019m not giving myself too much credit but a little pay on the back is due! \n\nGranted it was a very busy time as my parents were visiting for two weeks and I have a girls weekend coming up that I\u2019ve been planning for and am super excited about so I\u2019ve been distracted. Yet I can\u2019t help but feel a victory. The last three and a half years of the relationship with him (after realizing he was a narc when I discovered his infidelity) was an absolute nightmare. Never physical abuse but mental, emotional and sexual abuse daily. Constant lies, manipulations and abuse. It was horrible. I didn\u2019t know up from down. Was deeply depressed and contemplating suicide regularly. I drank myself twenty five pounds heavier and into a concussion after a particularly bad drunk episode. I could barely function. I looked terrible, I felt terrible. My house was a wreck and so was my life overall. My credit went to shit and I racked up 20k in debt from medical debt and college loans for our daughter. I was so angry all the time! If I wasn\u2019t angry I was crying my eyes out! It was a really bad few years for me. The worse part was knowing what he was and what he did and was continuing to do and still being unable to leave. It compounded the nightmare. \n\nUntil, finally, one day just over four months ago, I found my backbone and kicked his scumbag ass out for good! I won\u2019t lie, it was so hard at first! I cried all the time. Or I raged! The first month was hell! Thankfully when I kicked him out I raged at him and caused serious narc injury so he refused to speak to me except through text. I think if I had to speak in person to him I would have crumbled and begged him back. Either way he basically left me alone (except for showing up here randomly to get tools until I put my foot down and made him come get it all at once. Enough of that!) and doing that helped me keep walking away.  \n\nThe second month was a little easier. I was less rageful. A little more nostalgic for the loss of our family unit, the future I had planned with him and the man I wanted him to be that he pretended he was. I was still angry (he wasted over two decades of my life!) but there was less rage for him. I started to feel pity for him. What a sad and pathetic life he lives always pretending. To constantly have to put others down to make yourself feel good is sad. To always be in completion with everyone must be exhausting. To be so fragile and weak that you can\u2019t engage in even a moment of empathy must be terrifying. So month two was mainly just feeling disgusted with him yet at the same time feeling pity for someone so lost and unable to be real. \n\nMonth three was mostly about me. It was when I demanded he finally come get all his stuff (there\u2019s still a lot here but nothing he needs immediately or for work so no more last minute surprise visits!). I got my house back in order, mostly! Still a few problem areas but it\u2019s no longer embarrassing if anyone sees it. I started reengaging in my interests since he\u2019s not here to insult me over them. I\u2019m even beginning to write a book! Fingers crossed I finish it and it becomes a best seller! (Total amateur here but one can dream!!) I also noticed during month three I looked so much healthier! I stopped drinking (not totally stopped but not getting shit faced every night. Maybe one to two drinks every few weeks!) and so my extra twenty five pounds just fell off and I\u2019m back to my normal slim, petite self. My hair and skin became healthier! People started commenting how much better I looked. Month three was a confidence booster I seriously needed. \n\nThen the four month mark came and went and I didn\u2019t even notice for a short time! I don\u2019t miss him. I miss the fake future we had planned. I miss the \u201cgood guy\u201d he pretended to be when he needed something but I definitely don\u2019t miss him. I get small snippets about him (I don\u2019t ask and keep a distance from anyone who is spending time with him) and he\u2019s still playing the victim. Which is good because every time I hear it I am validated in my decision to throw him out. I still get angry and find myself yelling at him in my head more often than I\u2019d like but I take back control easier. Some days are harder then others but overall I\u2019m thinking about him less and less. I care less about what he\u2019s doing and spend more time thinking about what I want to do. My relationship with our daughter has greatly improved since he\u2019s been gone. I\u2019m less on edge and so our interactions are less strained. While my parents visited she slept on a cot in my room and each night before bed we would chit chat for sometimes an hour or more and it was wonderful! No arguing! Just easy chatting about anything and everything. He brought a lot of tension into the mix and I never noticed until he was gone. My parents also noticed how the overall atmosphere here was better. \n\nIt can only get better. As I heal and think of him less and less I think of me more and more. When I take care of me I\u2019m better able to take care of those I love. I\u2019m staying in better contact with family and reaching out more to friendships I let slide in my depression. Each day I get closer to being me again. \n\nI know I still have a long journey to be of healthy mind and spirit again but I\u2019m well on my way. To all of you still stuck in the nightmare please don\u2019t lose hope. I know how scary it is to want to leave. I know the endless doubts but trust in yourself. Each day you spend without that toxic person the sun shines a little brighter. There will be many dreary days at first but it gets so much better! Believe in yourself and know that you can have a better life without that narc. You deserve happiness and real love. You deserve better! And trust me please that it is better! Narcs are dead weight! Drop that burden because it\u2019s not yours to carry! Let them flounder through life because you will shine so much brighter without them!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Do her stories or explanations have huge holes in them, to which she blames on a poor memory?\n* Do you feel like you\u2019ve sort of gradually lost yourself in this relationship?\n   * Do you feel emotionally and psychologically exhausted?\n* When her character comes into conversation, does she attempt to divert the conversation to an unrelated topic?\n   * Often interrupting you mid sentence while doing so? (Can be as simple as \u201cLook at \u2026\u201d)\n* Did she claim to be cheated by every one of her exes, so she knows how it feels and would never do that to another person? B/c she knows first hand what it\u2019s like?\n   * Did she mention \u201cIf you\u2019re in a relationship and you want to hook up with someone else, why not just end the relationship first like a decent person rather than be a cheating scumbag\u201d?\n\nIf you\u2019ve answered yes to any of these, my advice to you is **RUN**, I wish I had someone send me something like this. \n\nTrust me on this, do not show this to her (at least for the rest of the night) and **google 'covert narcissism'.** You can also **google \u2018love bombing\u2019, \u2018gaslighting\u2019, and 'being discarded\u2019.**\n\nTo be blunt, **you are in love with a lie**. With a facade created by an emotionally broken child in an adults body. I fell for it too. Only once I saw what was under the mask, did I commit to never contacting her again. There is seriously a monster under there.\n\nShe does not care about your feelings, she may say that she does and put on an act to display she does, but eventually you will see through it.\n\nFor the majority of the relationship, I thought she was my soulmate and the person I was going to marry. It is **very** likely she has been cheating on you the entire time. Hopefully you haven\u2019t been with her too long.\n\nRegardless of how long you\u2019ve been with her, once she knows you\u2019ve seen under her mask, you will be discarded. It will be as if you never existed in her world. So my advice to you is discard her first. Block her number and on all social media. Completely block all forms of contact with her.\n\nShe will try to lure you back in eventually, however at first she will be preoccupied with trying to find a new narcissistic supply (most likely on Tinder). Brace yourself, any communication she sends you about \"I'm so sorry\" and \"I'm such a terrible person\" and \"I just want to say one thing\" is not sent because she feels bad about her behavior to you. \n\nShe wants to draw you back in to feel that she still has power &amp; control over you. And once you are back with her, she wants to punish you severely for discarding her previously.\n\nShe is capable of a lot more than the vulnerable victim she presents herself as. \n\nMy best advice to you is to block her and don\u2019t look back. The person you love never existed\u2026 it was a facade created by an extremely toxic, manipulative person. She lacks empathy and I know it may be hard to see and believe, but she is using you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople like her are dangerous to be around, please take my word rather than learning the hard and painful way.\n\nI wish you the best of luck on your journey. Remember to always trust that gut feeling, it's always right.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Not a peep for a long time. I often heard he was \u201csurprised\u201d I hadn\u2019t gone crawling\n\nA few months after the break up I met a sweet man. We continue to be in a loving and healthy relationship. However, when my ex found out about my new relationship, i started to hear about things he was doing that I firmly believe he was doing to get a reaction from me. From asking mutual friends out on dates to actually dating a mutual friend of ours (someone he often called mean names). He and said girl are still dating and he recently took her on a very romantic trip to Europe. A trip he took me on several years ago. Yes,Europe is a huge continent but he decided to take her to the one tiny beach village and lovely hotel that meant a lot to us. It\u2019s one of the only happy memories  I still have of our 3 year relationship. He\u2019s taking  the same pictures in the same spots as before.  I\u2019m not sure why he chose that location out of all the places to go. \n\nWhile the breakup is years old and I finally feel like he did me a favor by breaking up with me, learning about this trip  triggered some sad feelings.  Im in a wonderful relationship full of honesty and trust now. But I can\u2019t help feeling that he chose this trip with her on purpose.

I have a younger sister who is 16 and I'm 17. I always help her when she needs help, and I'm nice to her in general. I'm that kind of person who likes discussing everything in a calm and diplomatic way if there are problems and stuff, so I know for sure that it can't be my mistake for what happens.. On the other hand, my sister keeps acting in a way, as if we're enemies. By that, I mean that everything is going fine, and then I'm there questioning what I did to her, as she's acting aggressive towards me out of nowhere. By aggressive, I don't mean hitting me (well..we'll get to that later), she talks back at me like she's trying to start a fight, and I'm there trying to dodge it and be calm, as I hate fights and anything violent..I just try to talk to her and find out what's wrong using logic and being calm, but logic doesn't seem to exist from her side...she sometimes brings up stuff I did over a decade ago (yeah, when I was like a kindergartner) trying to make me guilty for them, trying to make me feel bad for stuff that I literally did as a baby. She keeps trying to make herself look like the victim, like we all did something bad to her, while I never did anything but give love and help to her.. There are times where she doesn't respect me at all and takes my personal stuff, and I always end up with bleeding scratches all over my arms in case I try to defend my self or take back what belongs to me.. I just don't get it. If someone takes something from you and then you ask for it back, aren't they supposed to give it?? Yeah I know.. That's not how it goes for my sister though. The other time, I had an important essay to write for school, using my computer, and she was the one using it to play videogames that time. Not only I let her use my pc, but when I kindly asked her to let me use it, she talked to me back in a rude way, and ignored me. I found myself begging for my own stuff back, as the day was about to end and I hadn't even started my essay for tomorrow. She then started to hit me, and I even tried to stop her but it didn't really work... At this point, I feel like she's stepping all over me, not acknowledging my rights, just thinking of herself. \nI don't know what to do anymore..our parents know what's going on, but they always just give her a mini lecture and that's it..they just dont take it that seriously, while they should. I don't know who can help me, if my own parents can't. They just want us to get along as we are a family, but at this point its impossible. \nNow that I'm writing this, she has again hit me, just because she was demanding to use my stuff.. I feel so useless right now.. I think that I'm getting abused, but I don't know what to do, my parents just think of it like \"oh its normal, siblings fight, we are a family after all\" but I don't agree at all..

{"post_id": "c57km2", "created_utc": 1561464365, "title": "I let him back in", "author": "ohaithr_spacecadet", "self_text": "It had been 8 months no contact and 11 months since I had physically seen him (he was arrested last July and I left him while he was in prison). I heard he was doing pretty bad, as unfortunately we both still have friends in the same circle. I met him in a 12 step program, and even though I'm no longer active in that program I still talk to a good amount of the people I met there. So I heard he was back doing drugs and stealing from people, wrecking havoc on other peoples' lives. Something clicked in me again where I wanted to know what he had been up to. My best friend kept telling me the latest news because my Nex started staying with her ex, and I ate that shit up. I'd try and casually ask questions about my Nex so as not to make my friend suspicious that I might have cared. Because the truth is, the last 8 months have been very hard, but I'm doing better than I ever was before and none of my friends or family want me to go back. So I would try and nonchalantly ask for more information on my Nex, trying to piece the puzzle together, trying to get as much as I could... for what?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm pretty sure it was just selfish motives. I started getting roped back into caring about him, about what he does, what he is up to. I knew before he was doing poorly he had started seeing a passive friend of mine--and I didn't care. I knew I was better of, far away from the abuse, the drug use, the anger, the cheating. But sometime in the last month, I feel like I started to soften towards him. I wanted to know what he had been up to. I wanted to see pictures of him on Facebook or for him to see how well I was doing. So I unblocked him Thursday. I creeped on him, but of course because he's using drugs he wasn't posting anything for me to creep on. I told my best friend about it, for accountability purposes and she understood but suggested I block him ASAP. I went to try and reblock him and wouldn't you know it? Facebook wouldn't let me block him again for 48 hours... it was \"too soon\". So two days go by and it's Saturday. My friend reminds me to block him again... and I do. But I message him on Facebook right before with something like \"Heard you burned your last bridge. Please go get help before it's too late.\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe read it and didn't reply. Two hours I got several long, angry texts. Accusatory, hateful, hurtful text. He was lashing out at me in any way that he could. And I fed into it. I knew better, but I still couldn't help but reply. I did feel different though. I wasn't emotionally dying like I used to when he would come at me. I was calm, and I felt like I could see through his anger and know that he was just trying to hurt me. I responded each and every time though, and I shouldn't have. We ended up texting back and forth for an hour, then he called me... and I picked up. We spoke on the phone for four hours. About the past, about how much he hates me and I hate him, but he loves me... About relationships that we've had since we broke up. About how I stole his voice from him when I went no contact. About how he should have treated me better. About how he is so sorry for never being there for me... I ended up crying a few times. I told him goodbye and that we couldn't talk again, that I had moved on. He said he knew and that he could hear something was different. He knew we could never be together. But he kept making these stupid, manipulative comments and my heart just started to melt. I started to feel responsible for him again, I started to feel like I was abandoning him again. I started to feel like I needed to save him again. But I know how all of that ends. He drains my bank account, he makes empty promises, he cheats, he lies, he steals, he hits me, he isolates me from my friends and family.... and then eventually I end up homeless and alone while he's in prison again. I've done this dance too many times with him and this is the first time I've successfully walked away. He has always walked away from me like it never mattered to him, leaving me to chase him and feeling devastated and alone... but for once I feel confident and capable. I don't want to lose this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo a day went by and he didn't bother texting me--which is good. He made me promise not to block his number and said he wouldn't blow me up. Then he texted me yesterday. I told him in the nicest, loving, most sincere way that I could no longer talk to him and that it was not good for either of us. We argued back and forth. It ended with me crying at my desk at work yesterday. Finally he conceded and said he would leave me alone... but \"won't say goodbye...not yet.\" He swears he's going to find the man that I used to love, swears he can't move on until he knows it's over. But, it is over. And he's making it harder on me and himself by doing this. I went on a date last night and for the first part of the date all I could think about was my Nex. He was an evil, hateful man. But I've never felt so much emotion for another person in my life. It's hard to shake. And it's hard to shut that damn door again. I should never have opened it to begin with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've told my best friend, my mentor, as well as some random friend. But no one else. I can't tell anyone because they will worry about me and worry I will follow him out there into the chaos all over again. I've got a really good job where I was just hired as perm after a year of temping. I'm in school again and doing really really well. I've got a relationship with my family after isolating myself from them for five years. And I'm about to move into my own place. My. Own. Place. I've never lived on my own; it's always been with boyfriends or roommates. I've got so much going for me, I shouldn't be playing with this fire... I am posting this because I have minimal people I can tell... and I need to be honest about what's going on because I know myself and I know I'll hide this until it's too late and I'm running with my Nex again, ruining the life I've rebuilt for myself.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Don't like sharing friend stories because I don't want to get them involved in it.\n\nAnyway, after the last argument, I was planning on going back and explaining where I was coming from, apologizing for my part in it, and maybe trying to repair things. But it's felt so freeing to not stress out about how to respond to him and to not think about how to approach him without setting him off. And after reading about DARVO (thank you to the mod who introduced me to that term), I don't think going back and revisiting the argument is going to result in anything other than him spinning my apology. But going no contact also feels just like a discard. I'm not worried about a smear campaign (we have a few mutual acquaintances, but no real mutual friends or colleagues)... I know I'll get brought up to any new friends as his most recent shitty former friend (probably with BPD or NPD. He likes to \"diagnose\" people), but again, I'm not too worried about that. But I'm worried how good it's felt on my end to basically go no contact with him. My anxiety has been low and manageable the last couple weeks, compared prior to the argument where I was having regular anxiety attacks (a couple big panic attacks too), but I can be fairly avoidant when it comes to confrontation, so I don't know if this is the right way to go about this. \n\nHow do you know if you're going no contact or if you're the discarder? And with a friend where I'm not worried about physical backlash, is there a better way to go no contact?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u2019ve only recently realized the way my STBX treated me during the marriage was abusive and manipulative and just plain mean.  The irony is, now that I\u2019m learning to put my needs above her\u2019s, she\u2019s accusing me of being a mean and abusive husband with no relationship or people skills.  The truth is that I\u2019ve just stopped playing her game and I refuse to take the bait and get into these long winded, one sided arguments where she plays the victim and cast me as the persecutor, even as she does all of the yelling, all of the name calling and cursing and gaslighting and all of the complaining and accusing.  I don\u2019t even respond anymore.  I don\u2019t argue.  I don\u2019t defend myself.  I don\u2019t try to set the record straight.  I just stand there and listen without taking it personally. I\u2019m able to see so much of it as projection of her own guilt that she can\u2019t acknowledge.  Education about narcissistic abuse is really the key to being able to become impervious to this crap.  \n\nThe one issue that keeps coming up for me, however, is this idea that part of what she\u2019s saying is true.  I have stopped talking to her, I have stopped trying to share intimacy with her, I have stopped trying to seek comfort from her.  I logically see this as a matter of self preservation but when she points out that these behaviors are not part of a \u201chealthy relationship\u201d, she is technically correct.  It\u2019s at this point in the conversation where that nagging doubt (that I think we all feel at times) creeps in.  Am I the narcissist?  I want to be an open book to people, especially in intimate relationships, but this person has proven time and time again that she is not a safe person to share deep thoughts with.  You cannot share your insecurities with a narcissist because they will always find a way to use it against you.  So it\u2019s quite distressing for me, now that I\u2019m so close to escaping, that she appears to be trying to reconnect by asking me to be more open, intimate and friendly with her, but deep down I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s safe to do so. I guess what I\u2019m getting at is, she\u2019s trying to gaslight me into believing that I\u2019m being an uncaring and thoughtless husband because I have all of a sudden started prioritizing my needs above hers.  Does that make me a narcissist?  Has anyone else felt guilty or disloyal when they stopped taking care of the narcissist\u2019s feelings?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My therapist at the time forced it out of me because my self harm was a daily thing at that point. My grandmother yelled at me for not telling her on the way home. I wasn't the only victim. My closest friend of a few years now and I were both victims. The abuser was a man down my street. I live in a very small neighborhood, so it's not far at all. Maybe a 2ish minute walk. He would talk to me every day. It started off with friendly conversation passing by and me petting his dog after school. He started following me up the street in his car to talk if the timing worked out. I would go on runs and he would make comments about my body. I was in middle school at the time. Eventually, my dad passed. I told him about it because he had become someone I could talk to for support and advice. He told me his was a doctor of some sorts and wanted to know what all was wrong so he could explain it to me to make me feel better. At some point, my best friend and I started going out for walks in the middle of the night. He would be awake during this and would come outside and talk with us. He became increasingly sexual towards us. He told us to take a selfie of us naked before skinny dipping and show him so we could see how much we've grown in a few years, and things like that. He would tell us about sex and said we could come to him to learn what to do. One night, we walked his dog for him. He promised us $5 to split between us. We loved that dog and he was like an uncle to us, so we did it for him and when we got back, he somewhat forced us into his garage. We couldn't really do anything because we're both petite middle school kids and he's an adult in his late 50's who's over a foot taller than us. So, in his cramped garage, we all talked. We were near the back wall and he sat in a chair in front of us. There was a car on each side of us, meaning we were now trapped. Eventually, he saw car lights and decided to pull down the garage door almost all the way. There was an inch of space. It was about 3:30 AM now. He got more aggressive and sexual. He put a vibrator on my inner thigh and then put it on her belly button. We kept looking at each other in fear. He then made us kiss. He wanted us to make out. He kept forcing us to. I started giggling because I was about to break down. He yelled at me to take it seriously. I decided to keep giggling. I didn't know what he would do. She and I had been holding hands out of fear. He stood up and his voice somehow boomed while not waking up anybody when he told us to just fucking stop if we couldn't be serious. He didn't force anything else physical, but he wanted us to touch each other sexually for him to watch. Now it was nearly 5 AM. I checked my phone and told him my family would be getting up and if I didn't get home they'd come look for me. Defeated I guess, he lifted the garage. Everything was a blur after this. I just remember sprinting up the street and holding her hand with a strength I've never experienced before and haven't since. My at the time boyfriend made jokes and looking back, I should've just left him at that moment because of it. Since then, he confessed everything to the investigator that went to ask him questions. He got bailed, but there's a trial soon. I don't think I'll be in town during it and if I'm not there my friend won't be. We both had to tell the story many times to adults and had CPS check on us periodically for a little bit. I'm glad to say that everyone in the case is set on giving him at least a year in jail. He still lives down my street, but he has to get out of my sight when he sees me. Sometimes he doesn't, but I tell my grandparents and they call the detective. I should be happy because of this, but I can't be. Sometimes I hear him yelling at me in my head and I shake or I freeze up and just blank. I already had trauma from early childhood before this. Sometimes at night I can't sleep because the night won't leave my mind. It's filled me with trust issues. My boyfriend is understanding, but he doesn't get it entirely because you just can't. I have extreme guilt and feel like it's all my fault still. The incident was almost exactly 2 years ago. I just wish I knew what to do to get over it and be able to love myself.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I struggle to *feel* anything or I feel everything all at once. And for a while I have had depersonalisation - I don\u2019t feel real, nothing around me feels real.\n\nI have realised, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been in denial. I\u2019ve denied my feelings - which are that I still love him and I hate myself for it. I hate myself for loving a monster. For loving someone who never did and never will love me back.

I feel out of sync, because I can\u2019t accept how I feel or what I think. \n\nThe pain/truth is too much to handle so the only way I have learnt to deal with it, is by shutting down emotionally. So I am numb and I have gotten use to feeling this way.

I will never be able to look at human beings the same way again. \n\nI still love him. I wish I didn\u2019t. I wish the nightmares stopped. I wish I didn\u2019t still feel like my mind is owned by him. \n\nI am in therapy. I talk, I cry, I do mental exercises, I look after myself. Yes, recovery is a long road. Yes there are good days.

I\u2019m nothing, but the girl he abused.\n\nRight now, I am cracking. I want to unblock his social media and stalk his accounts. I even thought about unblocking him and asking him how he is. I know it will end in my feelings being hurt or an argument. So why do I want to do it? It\u2019s like any attention is better than none so I\u2019ll settle for the worst. I\u2019m in pain, but it\u2019s like I want to make myself feel worse than I already do. Like I want to punish myself for how I feel.

He has booked a room again for another week but it is very expensive.  We live in a 2 bed flat in london.\nHe has agreed he needs therapy. We both agree we should do individual and together as we need to be able to communicate for the kids.\nI feel like it would make more sense for him to move back in but sleep in the living room so we can spend the money on therapy instead of on his room. \nIt feels right.\nPrior to all this i was ready to leave and divorce but we have been talking now. \nThere is still loads to sort but as long as we can be civil and work together like we have done since Saturday i think we cpuld actually be happy.\nHe has apologised.

Before I go on my rant I just want to say that I\u2019m fully aware that men get abused by women, men get abused by other men, etc and the effect of abuse are traumatic for anyone. I really don\u2019t want anyone commenting trying to make this a struggle contest on who has had it worse than the other. I want to talk about specifically narcissistic men right now, and not women.\n\nWith that being said I\u2019ve really been wondering why the hell do so many people defend narcissistic men for? In my experience after dealing with the ex narc people would bend over backwards defending his abusive behavior. He\u2019s a malignant narcissist, but he is more overt than covert. There was many times where he disrespected me in public and people just pretended like it was normal. He was abusive in every way except for sexually abusive, but when he would abuse me it would mostly be in public and people would make any kind of excuse for him. It was always,\u201d He\u2019s a man. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing.\u201d He didn\u2019t know what he was doing when he physically abused me? He didn\u2019t know what he was doing when he manipulated me into thinking I was a horrible person because I didn\u2019t want to be around him 24/7? He didn\u2019t know what he was doing when he kept on abusing me knowing I was suicidal?\n\nAfter the abuse was over and when I finally realized he\u2019s abusive I reached out to a few people and one of them is someone on youtube that allegedly is supposed to help narcissist abuse victims. When he was reading everything I went through with the ex narc and talked about how he once hysterically laughed a video of a girl getting slammed on the ground by a police officer and dragged.He read that and pretended like that normal behavior and basically said that I shouldn\u2019t have had any expectations for him and he was right to treat me like trash because I\u2019m his ex. \n\nI had an argument online with someone that basically said I deserved to be abused because I was still talking to him when he had new supply. This person was bending over backwards defending the narc.  Yes I know now to be careful who to tell, but that\u2019s not my point.\n\nThe scariest thing about this is that I think this is normal for people to do. My best friend has been raped over 4 times by multiple men and one we both think is possibly a narcissist.When she reached out to someone else for support they told her,\u201d Maybe it\u2019s the way you present yourself that makes them do that.\u201d I was horrified when she told me that and yes now (obviously) to be careful who she tells. \n\nIt just feels like when it comes to narcissistic/abusive men a lot of people will dismiss it and come up with every excuse in the book to defend them. I also strongly feel like if it was the other way around I would not be able to get away with doing half the things the ex narc I was dealing with did to me in public. \n\nYes I know everyone doesn\u2019t act like this, but it does seem like a lot of people do make excuses for them and support them anyway. This post is really all over place. I just really want to know if anyone else can relate to this. I just feel like this isn\u2019t talked about for some reason.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He said because I said no that gave him all he needed to actually do it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t answer me for hours, I would sit and cry while texting/calling him hoping he would answer and when he did he said he was sorry and it was his fault. But later he blamed me for it.\n\nHe always blamed me for everything that went wrong, then he would apologize and blame me again. \n\n\nI had to remove him from my life, I felt like I couldn\u2019t breathe, sleep or eat with him present.\nWhen I did this he made fake accounts to talk to me, he gave my phone number to his friends to get them to call me and harass me, they would said \u201cadd Jon back, he says he\u2019s going to kill himself because you left\u201d and similar things.\n\n\nI\u2019m 2018 he DM-ed me on Instagram and tried to have a friendly conversation with me, while telling me it was my fault the friendship ended, because I was the rude one.

The enormous amounts of cheating and then gaslighting me to believe his lies almost really broke me. I know when you go playing detective your going to find stuff you wish you wouldn't have but it was the only way I could get the truth.

Of course she's already seen the signs and follows me and wants my # and wants to know if I can tell her a little bit more about him. I'm still so fucking angry all the time that I know I probably shouldn't talk to her but I give her my number anyways. I have had 2 at length conversations with her now and it's really not my intention to break them up. I just wanted to school her about just what it is she's working with. I'm pretty sure she's still in the love-bombing stage so nothing I say she is going to believe anyways. I hate him so much that I sent her parts of recordings and screen shots of all my missed calls from him on my phone to prove I am not some psycho bitch he is portraying me to be. But then again that's kind of crazy that I did that but I don't care. I'm sure none of made a lick of difference he knows how to sink his claws into a chick and get them to stay - I'm a prime example.\n\nOn the bright side I have been no contact since March 1 the day I kicked him out for cheating on me for the very last time.\n\nTHANKS FOR LETTING ME VENT!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The stepmom physically and emotionally abused me while my dad was away at work or too busy drinking in his room. Stepmom wouldn\u2019t feed me, and when she did, she would force feed me garbage from the trash and get a kick out of watching me down it. Made me shower in cold water because she didn\u2019t want to waste money on hot water on me (not that she was paying for any of the bills). Cut my hair to a rough bowl cut because someone made a comment that I was pretty and didn\u2019t say anything about her biological daughter. Dad eventually didn\u2019t want to take care of me anymore (not that he really was taking care of me) so he handed me off to my mom. She was living with my brother in a different country at the time, but moved to where I was living so we could live together.

I got rid of my male friends. \n\n\n* when I got pregnant he accused me of cheating and said the baby wasn't his, but he would alternate this with being really nice and sweet until something set him off (usually me being lazy and not deep cleaning the cabin after work. I should note we lived without running water at the time).\n\n\n* i stayed home with our kids for several years while he worked in the oil fields \n\n* when he was gone he would call me and accuse me of cheating, when he came home we would constantly fight.

{"post_id": "c5nubv", "created_utc": 1561542366, "title": "An expats experience with an emotionally abusive boyfriend", "author": "champagne_raptor", "self_text": "In early 2017, I ended a long-term relationship to fulfil a dream of moving from Australia to London. An old work colleague who I was friends with kindly offered to let me move in to his spare room, offering cheap rent and to help me get set up in the country. After about a month in his home, he suggested we become a couple, insisting that he thought it would be great. I had reservations about our viability long term, did not feel ready for a new relationship so quickly after my old one had ended and was worried about my housing situation if it did not work out, but I agreed, craving some kind of security and familiarity so far away from home.\n\nThe red flags popped up almost immediately; after a few months ticking off places I'd always wanted to go to in various London tourist spots, he had an angry outburst one morning, complaining about how much of his time and money I was taking up. Not wanting to anger him further, I did not suggest anymore weekend outings and we rarely went any farther than the local pub for the remainder of our relationship. Keen to see the rest of Europe, I suggested holiday destinations which he expressed little interest in, saying that \"we'll go one day\". Unsatisfied with that response after waiting for over 2 years to commence my life here, I planned a holiday with friends, which enraged him when he discovered he was not included. As a punishment, it was almost 10 months before he agreed to go on holidays with me.\n\nAlmost daily arguments between us started that no new couple should go through - he liked to dip into my money when he ran out of his before payday, yelling at me if I questioned how he could run out when my rent money cut his living costs in half, calling me stingy if I asked for the money back. Satisfied that he had already secured me, he made no effort to make me feel important or prioritised, and we rarely went for romantic evenings. Fights over who did more cooking and cleaning were a regular occurrence, and while he insisted on undivided attention talking about his hobbies or complaints, he would keep his eyes firmly on his phone or laptop when I confided in my homesickness or frustration with adjusting to my new lifestyle.\n\nMy new partners indifference to my struggles manifested itself into depression, anxiety and insomnia. Anxious about the possibility of being homeless, I would ruthlessly throw away items preparing to fit everything I owned back into the two suitcases I had brought over. At work, I lost count of the amount of times I would sit in a bathroom stall and cry uncontrollably, averting eye contact with my work colleagues to hide my red eyes and blotched face. After a 2 hour commute home, I would regularly be greeted with silence as a punishment for some minor transgression which went on for days at a time despite my pleas. Giving him further ammunition for what upset me, I would lie awake and cry alone in the early hours of the morning, wondering where my once happy life went.\n\nBefore I knew it, several months had gone by with my hopes for my new life long forgotten amidst long evenings spent either screaming or lying in bed alone. The more effort I made to communicate in a healthy way, the more he doubled down on his opinion that his ways were correct and I was the one who needed to change. I would lose my temper, telling him it's not fair that I've changed my entire life while he changed nothing. No amount of heartfelt pleas seemed to work, and he reaffirmed his opinion that anyone who thought my behaviour was acceptable clearly didn't know me very well - my friends, family and ex boyfriend included.\n\nI recognised much of his behaviour as both abnormal and abusive from the outset - the refusal to admit fault, the inability to either say sorry or show any empathy, the entitlement he felt to what was mine and his insistence that anyone who showed me an interest either \"didn't know how bad I could be\" or was simply drunk. I played into the routine as well, keeping my fights with him a secret from my loved ones, not wanting them to think badly of him. Despite being insecure about his looks after bad dating experiences, he began to mock me about my body and my clothing, lashing out if I made any retaliatory remark or asked him to stop, claiming it was a joke. I knew I needed to leave but the dynamic of our relationship made me fearful of carrying on my life with no friends, in a bad job and deteriorated mental health. So I clung onto the hope he would realise how miserable he made me and change his ways. When he left me alone at home on New Years Eve because I tried to give him a drink when he was busy working on a hard drive, it became clear that wasn't going to happen, and gave me the push I needed to make the move into a house-share.\n\nThings improved for me from that point but his mind games increased and I endured many humiliating walk outs in pubs, his food and pint half finished in front of me, scrambling to sell tickets to events when he changed his mind because of a message he decided he didn't like the tone of, or simply because he changed his mind. During our extended break ups which often lasted a month or longer, I would hop on Tinder to seek validation from others, less sure of myself after months with a man who refused to compliment me.\n\nAs many others who have similarly been in unhealthy relationships, there isn't one defining ending moment that caused me to break free. Realising that I only identified with every sad song on my playlists, had forgotten what security and intimacy felt like with a partner and generally spent walking on eggshells trying to monitor my words and behaviour to please him just became overwhelming. I cut all contact after a row over something minor and never looked back, focusing on my own happiness and self-sufficiency. Besides an enduring case of insomnia, I take many things from the shit-show of a relationship that dominated my life, and I feel I am a much better partner because of it. I hope that my story can inspire someone else to take the leap that I wish I took far sooner than I did.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

People don\u2019t understand (including myself) why I\u2019m still not over it when it was so short. \n\nI\u2019m certain she was a narcissist but what really gets me with this one is that she didn\u2019t even think I was worth the love bombing phase. I don\u2019t know if all narcs do this but she essentially seemed to see me as a very easy target and used me for sexual and emotional gratification. I was in a very weak place mentally at the time and she clearly identified this. She even said she thought I was incredibly shy on our first date. From day one she said she didn\u2019t want anything serious but we\u2019d see where it went. So it was never FWB, casual or serious. I had no idea what it was and she wouldn\u2019t address it until I forced the issue essentially. At which point she told me she\u2019d never be exclusive with me in any form whatsoever. \n\nShe would get very intimate with me on our dates and I was convinced she was into me.

They've been trying to insert themselves into my life for the past 13 years. They manipulated me into doing things at a young age that I was not ready to do. It wasn't until I recalled a memory from when I was 14, that I realized it was abuse. I made this realization last month and couldn't stop crying. All of a sudden it all made sense: why I felt hatred toward them, why I couldn't get them out of my mind, why I would alternate between wanting them as a friend and wanting them dead. \n\nI always excused their behavior because they had a rough start in life. I realized that their rough start did not excuse what they did to me. I always knew they wanted to control me. I would be in new relationship and they would send me texts saying \"Hey\" or \"I saw that you moved, I'm glad things are working out for you.\" They always had to remind me that they were there. They always were trying to contact me.\n\nI blocked their number. All of social media, whatsapp, etc. I even went to far as blocking them on venmo. I wanted to be sure they had no way of contacting me ever! I want nothing to do with them and to never see their face. I don't even say their name. On the days that I do need to talk about them or vent, they are only reffered to as They/Them or 'the person whose name we don't say'. It seems excessive sometimes, and I feel ridiculous because this all started at a young age. It took me 13 years to realize what happened to me and to make sense of it all.\n\nMy problem now is that they are haunting me. I've been having nightmares about them. I can't stop thinking about them either. I moved out of my hometown two years ago, so I don't run into them or have any reminders of their existence. But my mind keeps reminding me. I feel like I'm obsessed. I've been with my current boyfriend for a year and we moved to a new city together. All of this stuff about my past has been brought up in the last two months and I feel like my boyfriend is tired of me venting to him. \n\nToday I decided that I needed help. I had a nightmare last night that they were coming after me and I was in my childhood home. I was crying and screaming at them all of the things they did to me.

I just feel like I need validation as to whether it was or not. This is going to be long, so I apologise. \n\nBasically my mum was the main instigator of this \u2018abuse\u2019 although my dad did sometimes too. I have diary entries from when I was 9, one being that my mum tried to strangle me. This happened twice. She didn\u2019t properly try to strangle me though. Just pinned me against the wall, put her hands round my neck and squeezed slightly. I could still breathe, although I pretended I couldn\u2019t to make her feel bad. But that still didn\u2019t make her stop. When the \u2018abuse\u2019 actually occurred, I never retaliated because I was too scared, which makes me wonder what would happen if I had retaliated. Would she have actually tried to strangle me? Part of me wishes I had been brave enough to do something. I also have diary entries talking about how my mum was in a good mood then a bad mood then a good mood again. To write about that seems like I was constantly analysing her mood and whether to avoid her or not, which I think I did do, but my memory is not clear. \n\nAt nursery (or kindergarten) I used to be too scared to ask to go the toilet. As a result I\u2019d wet myself often. My mum used to pick me up and get mad and take me home and make me have a cold shower as a punishment.\n\nMy mum also used to shout at me and chase me up the stairs to my room when she was going to hit me. I ran up to my room when I knew she was going to hit me because for some reason I thought it would be \u2018safe\u2019 when in fact there really was no escape. I used to sit on my bed to try and avoid her hitting me but she used to shout and scream at me so loud that I was too scared to do anything but comply and stand up and let her hit me. She used to pull my pants down and hit me, sometimes multiple times. I remember her hitting me one time and shouting at me that if I didn\u2019t stop crying she\u2019d hit me again, but I couldn\u2019t stop because I was scared and so she hit me around 5 or 6 times. I don\u2019t know if there were marks. I never checked. I thought that being hit was completely normal, which is probably why I never brought it up with anyone. She then used to blame her sore hand on the fact that \u2018she had to hit me\u2019. \n\nShe also stopped the car and made me get out twice. I was probably about 9 both times. I was being annoying in the car. One time my sister was singing and I put my hand over her mouth (and maybe her nose? I can\u2019t remember) in an attempt to stop her singing and also breathing I think. Obviously that was a horrible thing to do, but my mum got so mad at me for it. But I bet I learnt that from her, that doing stuff like that is ok. She did stuff like that so why couldn\u2019t I? When she chucked me out the car she\u2019d drive off maybe 100m or so and leave me there, then stop the car and then scream at me to get back in it. I used to think it was because she had changed her mind, but now I realise it\u2019s probably because she didn\u2019t want anyone to see what happened (happened on country roads with little traffic).\n\nShe also used to scream at me. One time I ran up the stairs because I thought she was going to hit me. Instead she just full on screamed, it was the most awful noise. She was very on and off with her moods. I always had to be on my guard. Spill a drink by accident and BAM - both mum and dad would shout at me. If this happens now I still find it hard not to cry, even though they don\u2019t get mad at me anymore if it happens.\n\nI used to tell her I loved her ALL THE TIME. I\u2019m not sure if this was a cry for attention. But I felt like I did love her. I was very very clingy to her, probably looking to seek her approval when in reality she didn\u2019t care. I wanted to hug her all the time but half of the time she would reject the hugs and say she was \u2018claustrophobic\u2019. \n\nThe thing is about all of this though, is that most of the time she said sorry. But it happened again and again. So I don\u2019t understand.\n\nI had forgotten about all of this, it had been completely blocked out of my brain somehow until at 13 my mum hit me and kicked me and screamed at me again. Afterwards my dad came into my room and told me I deserved it. I was being an idiot yeah, I was complaining a lot, but I just think there are a lot better ways to do things than blowing your lid and using physical violence.\n\nI haven\u2019t been hit or anything since. My parents have changed for the better (well, mostly. There are other issues but they\u2019re not abusive), but towards me and my sisters they are no longer abusive. \n\nIf you read this far, thank you. It means a lot.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I have been with my NH for more than 20 yrs less than 30 yrs.

Finally went to therapy to \u2018fix\u2019 myself and find out what was \u2018wrong\u2019 with me. Several therapists later (because the first 2 decided they weren\u2019t equipped for my situation after some time) and am finally making some headway. NH is an insidious covert narc, never physically harmed me, never has once used a curse word or derogatory word toward me,  will never raise his voice, and is on the outside and to any other female, the \u2018perfect husband\u2019 and \u2018perfect father\u2019 and is the type of guy for which males will have a \u2018man-crush.\u2019  So, I start figuring things out and suddenly NH decides he needs therapy and admitted he likely is a Narc. Most likely a manipulation tactic, but whatever placates him while I work toward my issues and eventual freedom. So, NH has had 4-5 sessions, and now tells me that tomorrow (thurs) the therapist wants to see both of us after work.  First flag, NH waits until after he knew that I had my therapy session for this week so that I couldn\u2019t discuss it, even though he\u2019s known since last Friday. Second flag, NH tells me that I should be aware that this therapist isn\u2019t very good. Third flag, NH tells me that this therapist is weak. So... my questions for the community at large are:\n1. Is this a common thing for Narcs in therapy to have partners join them? (FYI I had begged for marriage counseling for YEARS on end and we even attended a few sessions finally... until of course, he was told the 2 week silent treatment was NOT an appropriate reaction to me being 10 minutes late getting home from work, and that was the end of marriage counseling. \n2. Is this something a I should call my own therapist and get an opinion on whether I should attend, out of fear it might set me back. \n3. What have any of you experienced with a joint therapy session if attended with a narc partner?\n4. How likely is this therapist to have been manipulated by NH, and I may be walking into lions den?  \n5. What is your honest opinion on what I should do, based on real experiences if you\u2019ve dealt with this situation.\n\nWe have 2 older children and sadly, they are fully aware of our situation, having lived thru it all of these years. \nI am typing this all out rather quickly so I do apologize for mistakes in grammar. \nAny advice would be appreciated at this point.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I keep worrying either :\n\nA) He'll try to contact me again indirectly or show up at my door injured like he did his last ex.\n\nB) I break again after blocking and things will be worse than before in the devaluation stage.  \n\nI've blocked him again and I hope I can stay strong. I'm so tired of feeling like I don't deserve to be happy. Tired of worrying about rumors. Sometimes I even end up binge drinking and crying myself to sleep. It's been a year.

We are never going to get a genuine apology from them, an admission of wrong doings, they are never going to validate our feelings or our experience. They are simply not wired this way. Closing their eyes to the pain and destruction they cause in our lives has become their religion, and they are fully devoted. They even blame us, tanish our image and convince themselves we are truly the problem. It is not personal, this is their survival.\n\nBut we with healthy minds or at least people with a real conscience struggle to understand this. We don't need to. It is what it is. All we can do is educate ourselves to confirm that we have infact been dealing with a Narcissist and run. If like me you have children with the narc, become totally boring and bland, he will flee from you and look for more 'interesting' supply.\n\nI know it's hard, I been there, begging for him to understand in tears, sending essays of texts and messages to his phone pleading for understanding and even a speck of humanity. I never got it. The most I got was a fake apology with no change of behaviour. I always without a single doubt always felt worse after expressing myself, because I was constantly invalidated.

If anyone reads this all. Give me advice. Anything is better than nothing.\n\nMy ex, 17 now (who is severally narcissistic and bipolar) (I was her first love) and I, 18, have been around each other for about 3 years now. We dated for a little over 2 years and been broke up since last November. \n\nDuring our relationship. My ex (who we will call \u201cK\u201d) never acted narcissistic, she actually seemed like a mentally healthy teenager until about a year an a half into our relationship. We had our fair share of problems and I had a really bad cheating habit at the time too and wasn\u2019t the best boyfriend by any means. \n\nAfter she had caught me cheating on New Years 2018. She changed as a person. Not just towards me but in general. She eventually got a job and I didn\u2019t get to see her as often and she became distant. In June of last year, we had broken up and it was constant arguing for a week but we started talking again and we got back together right before the end of June. The day before we get back together she tells me that she was talking to a guy who came and saw her once or twice but left it as that and told me to not message him. (I messaged him anyways)  Luckily I did because he told me she kissed him etc. A painful part about it wasn\u2019t kissing him but she had sex with me while talking to him and me never knowing any of it until after. After that I forgave her and moved on because I knew I was far from perfect given my past with cheating. \n\nIn July, I went on vacation to where my first love lives  but I went because my family had grown up there. Over the time I was there K didn\u2019t let me log into my Snapchat much or she\u2019d get mad and be that way for a week or so (I was in her Snapchat instead and kept it that way) My first love never knew I was in her city until after I had left and that\u2019s because my ex bragged that I was coming home on Snapchat. \n\nAround a month later in August. My brothers girlfriend who use to be her best friend. Told me that K had cheated back in May with a whole different dude (named \u201c C\u201d) who she worked with. I confronted her and she ignored me for 2 days (at school and at home)  My brothers gf had invited me over and I decided to go to free my mind and get rid of the bad feelings I had. Anyways I ended up drinking and I had told her and she finally decided to come over and speak to me. We were fine and I forgave her.\n\nThere\u2019s some small things in the past until November but mostly on her side because I was doing the best I could to be a good boyfriend and not cheating etc. There was a slight build of time where she\u2019d ignore me. She didn\u2019t want to hang out or anything even at school she\u2019d not talk to me and if she did then she\u2019d have an attitude and it went on for about 3 weeks and she started really dressing up for \u201cno reason\u201d at the beginning of the 3 week mark. I had known something was up\n\nThis next part is where she shows the narcissistic personality \n\nIn November. I had been on her Snapchat a few days while she was at work (usually it was okay) I had saw she was really talking to the C dude she cheated on me with again and they were big friends at work etc. On the 16th we broke up because I asked her if she was cheating on me with him. No reply. She said she was done and later on I had logged into a friends Snapchat and asked the dude about it myself pretending to be my friend. She said they kissed the day before we broke up and the night of it as well as the following day. I was heartbroken. She never said anything to it but she blocked me on everything except kik. We talked for the rest of the night and she promised she\u2019d think of getting back together and a whole load of promises and statements as well as questions. She started putting all the blame on me and made it out that she was the good guy who never did anything wrong. \n\nAbout 2 weeks later in about early December. We had been fighting the whole time and I had to practically beg for her to speak to me because she didn\u2019t want to talk anything out except hurt my feelings (and occasionally leading me on saying how she missed me etc)  One day she had told me that I was whipped and like an hour later she told me that she missed me and she\u2019d been still thinking about getting back Together. The next day \nShe changed her profile name to 12/3/18 and she kept saying it wasn\u2019t for anything but I knew it was for her and C. On the 23rd she had a new guy text me saying he was about to get with her and I had a break down, lots of Anxiety and I was just freaking out because she kept leading me on and told me that it would be me etc. Me and her eventually argue until like 2 something and I had done something that worried her and she changed her attitude and everything, promising that we\u2019d get back together and that she wouldn\u2019t date until we do etc. Things go smooth for about a week or so. I was kissing ass showing her presents I had of hers from before we broke up and even stayed up all night on FaceTime a few nights. She told me on New Years that she was blocking me until the next Tuesday and she left and never unblocked me. When school started, I didn\u2019t go, I completely stayed home and eventually had to be put into online schooling because I was so depressed (missing over 3 months of school) and unsure of myself and what I\u2019d do if I saw her. While she was at school she got it around that I was wanting to hurt her despite me never even being at school or saying anything at all directing that I was going to harm her. They send 3 school officers to my house telling me to not come back to school for the following days and told me something like if I show up then I could be charged with several things. I never went. She eventually messaged me a few days later after being told to cut contact several times from November until Then. She at first kissed ass to me again and started leading me on for about all of January telling me things like she missed me and she wanted to be with me but she was scared she\u2019d get hurt and all that. (During all of this time she had an Instagram keeping eyes on me because she didn\u2019t want her main to have me unblocked. This is still on going) \n\nUntil the 8th of February. Dude number 4 had text me saying they were talking (I had no clue) so being led on and hurt I had went off on her and we cut contact until a little after  the 18th or so. Me and K were up all night talking and trying to talk about stuff that needed to be talked about. She eventually  starts accusing me of stuff without saying it directly and still making things out to be my fault and even tried to lead me on AGAIN while talking to dude 4. I told him and they stopped talking for a day. About 2 weeks later. They stopped talking because of me. \n\nOn the 4th of March she messaged me and Saying how she\u2019d like to be on good terms and just friends. I told her I couldn\u2019t do that because I wasn\u2019t ready to be friends and the next day she got with another different guy (\u201cS,\u201d who plays a bigger roll soon)\nThey break up on the 23rd and I message her being a smartass but she was being genuine and nice after she replied. The next day we talked and she hinted at not being busy and wanted to come see me. (Me being still in love with her, I get dressed up nice etc and gave her her Christmas stuff as well) she didn\u2019t once look me in the eye or hug me. We talk even after that and she starts leading me on again saying maybe there is a chance and other stupid phrases. We talk for about a week and she acted funny again and I started asking about it. She said there isn\u2019t anybody but I knew that was a lie until she sent a picture of her most recent bf. (J) \n\nA day after they got together. I had slept all day because I couldn\u2019t sleep at night. I had gotten messages from both S and J saying to meet them and fight. I told them that it wasn\u2019t worth my time but if they insisted then they could meet me at my house. 2 hours later at 9:20pm I see my ex\u2019s car (K\u2019s car) being driven around my block 3 times being trailed by another truck that ended up being S. She showed them where I lived. On the 4th time it was just the truck and S pulled up with 4 other guys trying to jump me. Both her current boyfriend (J) and her ex (S) were there. That situation does deep into it but the next day I message J and he kisses ass saying he just wanted to be civil. We were fine after. \n\nAbout week goes by in April and I\u2019m hanging out with my cousin and we go to McDonalds (her old work place) she got mad saying that even when she\u2019s not there I\u2019m not allowed on the property or even go through drive through ( I only wanted a fricking ice cream cone) that led to a lot of arguing but it stopped after I had my choice of words. \n\nAround a week or so later again. I text her saying if she wants her clothes back from me. She said no and to stop texting and that no body cared about me.  Later on into the night she messaged me again with her current bf and started accusing me of rape  and a few other harsh accusations that weren\u2019t true. (Idk why she accused me of that but if so then why did she come see me again) but it led to mostly an argument. Later on into the night. I get contacted by the police telling me and her as well as her bf to not have contact at all or we could be arrested. \n\nThere want any contact until just recently like 3 weeks ago out of the blue. She messages me asking if I was \u201cchill\u201d. I told her yes but that I didn\u2019t want to talk or be friends since I wasn\u2019t ready for it. (By then I was having a really bad anxiety attack and I was freaking out.) She said she understood but She post it on her instagram making it a big deal about me telling her no. I messaged her back saying it doesn\u2019t need to be public or a big deal. Later in the night. She text me asking why I was upset and we eventually talk for a bit and she just didn\u2019t get the hint (All of this while she has the same boyfriend from before) she eventually posted something saying she wanted something or someone and even put a C for my name in the smack dab middle of the post. She told me it was for me. She kept hinting saying she didn\u2019t want things to be like this and that there was a plan that No one could know because if her circumstances (she was talking about being in a relationship).  Eventually a few days of hunting back and forth and me Being distant to her. She got me in my feelings and I had anxiety attack while texting her. She ended up admitting that her and her current boyfriend wouldn\u2019t last because of several reason and then eventually over the next week, pushed it into my head that she was 100% going to be with me. She might\u2019ve even had herself convinced too. Idk.. \n\n(Keep in mind she\u2019s still with the same guy) \n\nOver the next week just the same old stuff. We talk and she made plans to see me etc. 2 Thursday\u2019s ago she came and picked me up and we went to her spots that she knows and we hung out. About half way into hanging out she kept trying to push my feelings out and get me to admit everything I had felt. (Biggest mistake of my life) We eventually hold hands and we start riding around and before she dropped me off. We kissed 3 times or so. She sent me a paragraph 2 hours later saying how she wanted to do all that and that it felt comfortable and that she missed how my kiss felt etc. Then said how that makes her worry again from the past then an hour later she sent me 120+ questions for me to answer. I spent an hour answering them for her explaining every answer and even gave me her Instagram login after.\n\n She broke up with her bf the following day. It all goes good until about the next day. She messages me freaking out at like 10 pm because I took a nap and told me to never leave. Shit gets said etc and apparently. He had sex with another girl the day after they break up and even had a second girl over the next day. Monday comes along and K told me she was hanging with friends (thank u guy feeling) she lied. She went over to his house and had sex with him while still talking to me. On Tuesday night, he sent her some freaky-post from freak accounts. I  didn\u2019t get to see but she deleted the DMs the following morning and I woke up and asked her why. She make it over dramatic and didn\u2019t talk to me at all that day until the night. She start Saying she didn\u2019t want to be in anything serious. I respected that but I eventually messaged J and asked about the situation. She deactivated both his and her instagrams until yesterday. I\u2019ve tried to talk to her and ask her why but she doesn\u2019t do anything but block me and thing that she can do whatever without an explanation even when it hurts. I eventually got her to speak and I asked her if she was done with me. She said she was and that it was for good. \n\nBefore I knew about all of this she had told me. She didn\u2019t want to be with me yet And us just talk until she\u2019s 18 is because she said her dad hated me and would kick her out etc. he found out because I\u2019ve told him, he\u2019s even said he\u2019d rather me than J because of reasons and she still said she didn\u2019t want to be with me.  Incase it\u2019s not obvious. She\u2019s a compulsive liar. Not just to me but to everyone. I\u2019ve recently become closer to her dad and I\u2019ve gotten him to try and talk to her to get herself together instead of being so messy and figure out what she wants. She will lie about it even to my face or her dads etc. I\u2019ve had to talk to him and even find out some stuff about this situation in the last week. \n\n\nI\u2019m sorry if anyone\u2019s read through all this and it\u2019s messy and a lot (I might have missed a lot of side details but oh well, it\u2019s been a lot these few months.) .

He flipped back and forth many times between accusing me, blaming me, apologizing, making promises he never followed through on... but all through it I could see his actions were selfish.\n\nStill, I struggle with breaking the cycle of being sucked into arguments and denying his claims and trying to use my own empathetic and caring ways to transition him into seeking help. \nNow I seem unstable because one moment I am trying to be loving in hopes it will make him realize what he is doing and then immediately blowing up with frustration because I know it is pointless and I am still being dehumanized while I carry his child.

Apologies for the extremely long post, I\u2019m trying to lay out as much context so I can get some informed opinions at the end of this. \n\nLet\u2019s call him T. \n\nBackground: We are both 29 and I\u2019ve dated a fair bit before we met. It was lovely to begin with, we liked a lot of the same things and we had fun. We were intimate a couple of times and then he suddenly woke up the next day and said he didnt see us working out long term. It had been only a month, so tbh, it didnt affect me that much, and the sex was quite tedious. He had made it amply clear to me in the beginning that he was inexperienced, so that I was prepared for, but the real thing was a different level altogether. The second time, something happened and my body and it completely shut down, needless to say it was terrible. That same night we also had a chat about something that we were on the opposite sides of, and I noticed he would just NOT let up unless I agreed with him, which I didnt. A few things about him: \n-He has a tendency to say horrid things that he knows will ride you, and then immediately say he was joking and I should lighten up\n-He constantly forgets (or pretends to not remember saying) things he said and has been proved wrong innumerable times but still comes out arguing in his favor constantly. \n\nAfter he said the thing about us not working out,  he kept insisting, even pushing that he wanted me in his life and would not let it be. I told him that maybe we should take some time (because while saying it wouldnt work out, he said some very unnecessarily mean things like the sex would have been better if you didnt direct me so much, or you made me nervous bossing me around) because he was clearly doing some sort of weird flex move with all this. He went to the extent of saying something along the lines of I-cant-even-remember-what-you-look-like, which I think was an attempt at showing me how over it he was because he was being defensive about being terrible in bed. I brushed it off because I could see he was being defensive, I take care of myself and I\u2019m very happy with what my body looks like, plus I\u2019ve had enough feedback from people I\u2019ve been with to know that my body is beautiful. \n\nAnyway I let it go, and as timing would have it, happened to reconnect with someone I cared deeply for a while ago which had abruptly ended due to a miscommunication. He started seeing somebody else he had met around the same time as he met me. She is 5-6 years younger than him, and he seemed to keep bringing it up when we did talk. I didnt care because I had reconnected with the man from my past and was very relieved to have the weight of that abrupt end off my shoulders. Let\u2019s call him AP. \n\nSo while I was ecstatic from knowing that AP had been thinking of me when I was thinking of him, the reasons we couldnt be together were still there so I knew I had to not get involved this time around. T encouraged me to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and break up with him. I had my reasons to. T said we should workout together to get my mind off things. I genuinely believe this came from a place of care. When I did go to his gym with him, I was wearing tights, sports bra and a tank top. While doing core exercises the tank top loosened up and I guess my sports bra was showing, he later basically just shamed me for wearing what I wore to the gym. \n\nHe went to meet this young girl the same night that we were supposed to do dinner. I didnt know it was a date with her, I would have insisted on doing our dinner another day. He was so weird about it, when he called saying he was going to be slightly late. I asked him if he was on a date, and he made it so awkward, he made her say it wasnt in the background, and insisted we keep our dinner (platonic). He finally showed up, said something about how he could smell me, so I told him to stop sniffing him because it was weird. He again got super defensive. ( I do have a very distinct smell cloud around me, it is a mixture of my shampoo-conditioner and my perfume, Gucci Bloom, so I smell like flowers and vanilla). He seems to say things and get very defensive if I respond to it at all. \n\nThis repeated another time when he went on a date with this girl and came to meet me after. I didnt know he was on a date with her this time either, I think it is weird to go out with someone and then go see someone you\u2019ve been intimate with before. Would be so weird to explain it to the date if things got serious later. Also, I found out that he had actually been a virgin when we got together and the whole story about him having been with two other women before was a lie he told. Honestly, it wasnt a big deal but the lying really got to me. I felt deceived and manipulated. He has, as I later discovered, told several lies in the course of our interactions, about things that didnt even matter. I let this go, because at this point we werent dating or involved and I honestly couldnt be bothered to react anymore. \n\nAnyway, we had an argument about something else this night and I essentially kicked him out of my house. I was quite over him saying things to get a rise out of me and then laugh it off saying I was being sensitive when I reacted. So when he said that he wouldnt fight for our \u201cfriendship\u201d if I was doing this (throwing him out). I told him i was okay with that. We talked after snd I told him he wasnt good for me and I dont feel like my best self with him around so I\u2019d like to not be in each other\u2019s life. He was respectful of my space for over a month. I will admit, I missed him during this time but knew that he wasnt a good presence. \n\nCut to 3 days ago, he reached out asking if I was well. I thanked him for checking on me and asked how he was. 4-5 messages at most. \n\nYesterday, out of the blue he reaches out with some update he made to his bumble profile (that\u2019s where we met too). I think this was to update me that the young lady was gone? And he kept saying how she never let him be about the night he made tell me it wasnt a date. I told him that I would have been weird about it too, it was quite shady. So i knew it wasnt me, because she went out with him after that night again. I asked him if he had made mean comments about her body like he had mine. This is where shit hit the fan. \n\nHim: wow did I really say that, maybe I need a therapist. \n\n\nMe: maybe\n\n\nMe: i knew you were doing some weird flex, i didnt dwell on it. Doesnt matter anymore. Sorry it didnt work out with her. \n\n\n(15 mins later)\n\n\nHim:sorry to say this but you\u2019re lying. I would never comment or compare someone\u2019s body to somebody elses, that is such a dick thing to do. For you to accuse me of something like that, makes me believe you\u2019re not as nice a person as I thought you were. \n\n\n(He always keeps telling me that I\u2019m one of the most decent people he\u2019s known, so this was clearly an attempt to get a rise out of me)\n\n\nMe: I remember what you said. I\u2019m not going to engage with you on this. \n\n\nHe then proceeds to go off on me, calls me names, tells me I\u2019m classless for accusing him of saying something he doesnt think he is capable of (he forgets so much, it is astonishing) blows up on me saying I had no morals and I was a disgusting person, and that all he had done was check on my out of the goodness of his heart and this is how I repay him. He kept saying \u201cshow me where I said this in out chat\u201d which is conveniently forgetting the HOURS we spent talking on the phone (and he said the thing he was refusing to admit he said on the phone once and to my face once). \n\nHe then tells me he is going to block me on Whatsapp. I told him I would never reach out but he can do as he pleases. He did it anyway and while the shit he spewed on me angered me, I refused to pursue this conversation. I know he thought I would angrily message him on text message. I refuse to engage. \n\nhe has always \u201cforgotten\u201d and argued for hours only to be proven wrong based on some message he had sent a long time ago that showed him saying exactly what I said he had. I have been through this with him several times when we were still talking and it was EXHAUSTING and emotionally draining.  He has often in the past said something mean, and when I tell him it hurt me, he said he was joking and I should lighten up and of course he didnt mean it. He has shamed me for what I wore to the gym, said if I got unwanted attention it was because I was asking for it with my clothes, slut shamed me for having dated in the past and been with \u201cso many\u201d people, \n\n\nI guess I\u2019m trying to figure out:\n1. Wtf is his angle? What does he want? \n2. Is this narc behavior or is this just some privileged douche used to getting his way and throwing a tantrum? \n3. I think he will reach out when he thinks sufficient time has passed and try to make this sound like a disagreement we had instead of straight up his abuse of me. My birthday is in a month, I think he will use this as an opportunity. If he reaches out, Should I ignore him or respond asking to be left alone?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Which usually at the beginning of any relationship is standard. The \u201craw, animalistic\u201d type of sex. \n\nHe somehow got out of me very early on that I  was sexually assaulted / raped when I was 14. It felt very good to tell someone so early on and that someone accepted and understood me...\n\nThe second time we had sex he asked me to spread my legs open wide and bend over. I was not comfortable with at the beginning of the relationship; I started to think of myself as a \u201cprude\u201d when he\u2019d talk dirty to me even though I\u2019m an extremely sexual person. \n\nWithin the first couple of weeks, he told me he loved anal, and that it was very important to him that he got that. I told him I was open but also that I\u2019d need time. He said \u201cin the past all of my girlfriends loved it and it was such a turn on for me!\u201d Basically introducing insecurity from the get go. \n\nHe would constantly cram fingers in my ass during sex. Like non stop. Without warning. I got to the point where I enjoyed it but at first it was weird that there was never any permission on my end. \n\nWithin 2 months of dating, the sex stopped altogether. I felt neglected and unattractive and couldn\u2019t understand why it suddenly stopped...\n\nI found myself asking and begging for it, which was so odd to me. He would always say \u201cI\u2019m so financially  stressed.\u201d Or \u201cmy stomach hurts\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m too high.\u201d Etc. But \u201cI\u2019m still so attracted to you!\u201d \n\nAs the relationship progressed, when we had sex he would pull out his phone and film us, sometimes without me knowing. \n\nHe would always avoid sex on a romantic vacation or after a great night of giggling, kissing, hands all over one another. In public he\u2019d whisper, \u201ccan\u2019t wait to fuck you on the kitchen counter when we get back\u201d and would literally start rubbing me or grabbing my nipples under the table to get me riled up. Then when we got home... NOTHING. \n\nWe eventually had anal... with no lube... and was a spur of the moment thing during a wild night of sex (which was rare for us) he was SO sweet and intimate with me (more than regular sex) like passionately kissing and grabbing me so tightly. It almost made me WANT to have anal again so he\u2019d touch me like that....\n\nHe never KISS KISSED me... it often felt very dead. No sensuality. No spontaneous make outs or anything. He only initiated sex late at night when we were already in bed and it felt robotic...\n\nHe never made any noise... ever. No \u201cthat feels good\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re so hot\u201d ... which also was so odd to me. Like, are you even enjoying this? I was always in my head. \n\nSome nights we had more \u201cintimate\u201d sex and he\u2019d hold a gaze with me. It always felt really weird to look into his eyes, felt dead. I blamed this on me and my sexual abuse... maybe I was the problem ?!\n\nWhen I confronted him about lack of sex again, later in the relationship, he said \u201cfor me, it\u2019s lack of emotional connection.\u201d Which felt sooooo weird because ugh, how can you connect w me when you don\u2019t even want to be intimate at all? Also, we lived together and were inseparable. He could barely even make decisions without consulting me first. \n\nThe oddest thing was....he was EXTREMELY affectionate. His hand never left mine. Ever. In public or in private. He always needed to be touching / next to me in a hand hold, arm around me, hand on legs or cuddling. \n\nAnyone else have weird sex issues like this?! Especially the withholding sex thing. Beside the obvious lack of emotional depth... where does this come from?!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When i told him my mom says i'm very impressionable he then was like can i ask you a very personal question. I said sure. They he proceeded to ask if i had ever been abused. I thought about it and was just like i don't think so? He said a lot of times people are impressionable when they have been abused. This had me thinking though because this isn't the first time by a long shot that someone has asked me if i was abused before. I feel like people are picking up on something i'm completely blind to??

{"post_id": "c6a50u", "created_utc": 1561665166, "title": "My Story (Long post)", "author": "corgo_cat", "self_text": "Hello all, I have finally decided to explain my abuse story with my ex boyfriend. I have unfortunately been abused by most of the men in my life, but this was and still is one of the hardest ones to heal from. My therapist suggested that I tell my story in hopes of finally moving on from it. I learn from my expirence in this relationship. Names and places have been changed as to not reveal anyone's location or identity. This is extremely long, but I would appreciate if you read the story. It is very complicated and long, but please bare with me. This relationship took place in a very dark time of my life. I am no longer with this person or my father, for those who are curious. I am in a much better and safer place now. \n\nTRIGGER WARNING\nEverything you're about to read is true and very graphic at times. If you want to read ahead, I'm warning you this is not pretty. \n\nI was just entering middle school when I met my first soon to be boyfriend John. He seemed charismatic and edgy, but I immediately wanted to be his friend. Being the little emo teen I was at the time, he was perfect. He made me laugh, teased me, and overall was my escape from my abusive father at the time. A few years passed and we finally started dating. I felt like I had someone who cared about me. He would tell my friends about how much he loved me and showered me with little notes and tiny homemade gifts. I was on cloud nine, but it wasn't how it appeared after a while. He started to call me names more and more. He would put me down in front of my friends whenever he got the chance. I felt a bit hurt, but pushed it off as him teasing me. One night we, about 2 weeks into our relationship, he started calling me over the phone, telling me he was scared his father (who he hadn't seen in 2 years) was going to break in and kill him. Worried for him, I told him to address this with his mother or therapist, but he insisted they wouldn't understand. I tried to reason with him, but he began screaming over the phone. I told him to calm down and he stopped talking. When I tried to get a response, out of nowhere he said \n\"I am going to kill myself.\" I froze in shock and confusion. I begged him not to, asking him if I could help. He then said\n\"I'm not good enough for you, [my name]. I knew I would never be good enough!\" He hung up the phone with me shaking. I tried calling him and texting him, with no responses. I freaked out not knowing what to do. Nobody knew we were dating in my household, and in hindsight I should've told my mother, but I was too scared she would scold me about dating when she had told me I wasn't allowed to. I kept calling and calling him, scared, and after an hour he answered. I asked him if he was okay. His response still haunts me:\n\"I just needed to know that you cared. I'm draining the water from the tub, but thank you. I finally feel like you care about me.\" That shook me. I had told him everyday that I cared about him, and this is his response? Before I could respond he said he had to go eat dinner and that he would text me later. He hung up and I sat on my floor unable to fully process everything that just happened. I wish I could say that was the last time and or that I told someone. He begged me not to, he said if I told anyone he would kill himself, hurt himself, or break up with me. In hindsight I really should've done something, but I was too scared to. My father did the same thing around this time and I felt like John was my only good thing. As the weeks went on these calls/threats of killing himself increased. If I didn't text him back, he threatened to hurt himself, if I tried to talk to my friends instead of him, he threatened to kill himself, telling me that I cared more about them then me and \"if you care about them that much then it wouldn't matter if I died.\"\nI slowly became alienated from everyone. He took over my life. If I wasn't with him, I was texting him and if i wasn't texting, i was calling. My sleep schedule became worse. He would make me stay up odd hours talking to him. \n\"If I'm asleep, you're asleep. If I'm awake, you're awake. That's how I know we are meant to be together.\" So I complied. I became more and more depressed. One night my dad emotionally manipulated me into letting him touch my legs after a shower. I had refused and he screamed at me. I ran up to my brothers room and locked the door. He banged on the door until he gave up and told me he was going to kill himself. Terrified and scared, I thought I'd call John for help. When I started to explain, John snapped at me.\n\"Why haven't you answered my texts?! Do you even love me?! What was so important that comes before me?!\" I tried to explain that what was going on with my father, but he did not listen. He screamed at me and said I wanted him dead. I made up a story just to be away from him. I started to cry and assure him no he was the only thing that mattered. He hung up, and the cycle continued. From then on, I didn't mention my father to him. John insisted I made it up for attention ever since that day.\nThis went on for a total of 4 months, to the point where my friends started to notice. One night, him, myself, and my bestfriend (Eliza) where talking over hangouts. I thought, with my best friend there, I could express that I was feeling depressed and alone. I wanted to tell her that it was because of my dad throwing things the night before, but I kept it vague. Saying I just FELT alone and depressed.\n\"You should tell your dad.\" Eliza said hearing about my thoughts. \"Maybe you just need medication.\" I wanted to explain that I couldn't, but John was texting me while on call that I made up my father's actions for attention, and that if I told Eliza that it was my father, he would hurt himself. I said:\n\"No, he just wouldn't understand\" I explained. It felt like a half lie not to tell her, but I valued John over my own self (yeah I could kick myself for that), so I kept it quiet.\n\"You're just being dramatic!\" John budged in. Eliza went a bit quiet as John lectured me about how him and Eliza had real problems with their parents, and that I just was being dramatic to fit in. I was about to insist, when Eliza agreed. I felt alone when she did this and went silent. They decided to leave the call. John then texted me:\n\"Hey.... \nI think....\nYou're unstable....\nAnd....\nWe should....\nBreak up....\"\nI looked at this message and cried. I tried to beg him to stay, but he then told me he was going to try to get with Eliza, that she understands him better than I ever could, and that if I didn't allow him to do so, I never wanted to see him happy in the first place. I shut off my phone and started to cry. My father came into my room all drugged up, passed out next to me. He was the only thing there, I felt alone, so I hugged his unconscious body and shook the rest of the night\n(Quick note, my parents were divorced at this time, but had shared custody)\n\nA few days passed and I told my friend Ashley everything. Showing her texts John had sent since the start of our relationship. She told me not to go back to him. I agreed, but John texted me the next day, and begged me to come back. Little did I know at the time, Eliza rejected him, so he came back to me. At the time I thought he wanted me back. He said he would be better and that it would be good. I told my friend Ashley, who immediately advised against it, but me craving attention that wasn't my father's actions, I took him back. \n\nAnd a week after taking him back I was back at square one with his threats of self harm, but this time, he wanted more. He would beg me to video chat him naked and make me touch myself. If I didn't he told me I didn't love him, that he would hurt himself, that he'd run away, or that he'd kill himself. I didn't learn my lesson the first time and complied. After every call I cried asking myself what I had done, what if he screenshotted me, what if he uses this against me, but he never did.\n\n(Short PSA please please, if you find yourself in this situation, tell someone. I was stupid and didn't tell my mother or another trusted adult about my father or John until it was too late. Please, you are worth more than you think. Nobody deserves to be treated like this)\n\nOn Valentine's Day of 2016, he invited me to his house to have sex and work on an English project. I walked into his house, his parents didn't disturb us, thinking we were just doing the project. Nobody knew we were dating, none of our parents at least. As we blasted music, so no one could hear, he looked at me and instructed me to strip, feeling my breasts and kissing my neck. I started to feel nervous, telling him I wasn't sure if I wanted to. He insisted that it was just me being silly and pushed me on the ground. He took of my pants and I started to panic. I started to push him off telling him \n\"Oh come on, we have a project to do.\" He insisted that this wouldn't take long and we would do that project later. He said I promised him all week, and seeing me over video wasn't enough. I tried to insist on the project once again, but to no luck. He started to eat me out, and I began to try to push him off. He smirked once I finally gained the strength to push him back entirely. He grabbed my arm and smiled, insisting that I just wanted to play. He pulled off his shirt and started to chase me around his room. I didn't know what to do. I looked at him and said.\n\"I just don't feel comfortable.\" He turned angry and yelled at me.\n\"You tease me with the videos and the texts and now you won't fuck me?!\" I moved back in fear. He yelled that I didn't love him, that he knew I would chicken out, and said that I was going to be the reason he was dead tonight. I started to cry and say I just didn't like his parents being so close and that of course I wanted him. He stopped and looked at me. He then said we could work on the project and then we could do stuff. I agreed, hoping he'd forget. But everytime we finished a part of the PowerPoint he would ask if we could do something. I then came up with the excuse of playing with his little sister. He guilted me afterwards saying I promised him, but eventually my mother came and picked me up. I finally was able to go home, but that night I endured more threats on himself. I finally came up with the excuse that I didn't want to get caught and that of course I wanted him. \nFinally, March 2016 came around and Eliza invited me over to her place to sleepover. John seemed fine with it, which surprised me, but I thought maybe he was finally understanding me. I hung out at her house and around 9pm, John showed up. Eliza had planned for him to come hang out. Eliza's mom said as long as John and me stayed in separate rooms, he could sleepover. So I agreed, thinking it would give me more of a chance to be with Eliza, but that didn't end up being the case. John and Eliza ignored me the rest of the night, to the point where they started flirting. I started to feel alone and noticed them getting closer. As I was about to try to hang out, my dad called me to say goodnight. He screamed at me for not calling him first and that he should just drive off a cliff. I hung up and cried in Eliza's bed, feeling helpless. Eliza heard me and decided to try to make me feel better by watching one of the movies I had mentioned earlier. We watched the movie as the night went on, but Eliza and John started to get even closer, snuggling on the couch opposite me. I decided I wanted to get John's attention so I drank some nail polish remover. This didn't end up killing me, instead I threw it up immediately after drinking it. Eliza and John called me stupid and I ran into her room, crying. After an hour John came in, saying he was sorry he didn't pat attention to me, saying he wanted me to see how it felt when I didn't give him sex on Valentine's. I said I was sorry. He smiled and said, if I was sorry I could make it up to him. He pulled out his dick and slammed my head towards it, forcing me up and down, and I started choking. I finally coughed so much that I forced myself back and hid under Eliza's bed. He started to backpedal. \n\"Oh you don't have to, you don't have to! Just come on out and we can talk!\" Me, being naive, came out from under the bed saying that I wasn't comfortable and I wanted to just talk, but as I fully came out, he forced my head again. I tried to push him back a few times to no avail, but then I finally fell back gagging. He looked at me and smiled. He told me: \"if you aren't going to suck me off, then you're just going to have to take it on your face\" I sat there shaking and coughing as he finished on me, then pulled up his pants and looked at me. He then said he was done with me and walked out. I threw up the rest of the night. Eliza asked me what happened in the morning, but John told her that we fucked. Before I could object she started saying how I was so cool. Later on we walked to a local bagel place, John lecturing me that I didn't have it bad. That I needed to live in his and Eliza's shoes to see what true pain was. I ended up leaving around 11 am that day and he texted me saying how we needed to talk. He said that he thought Eliza was into him, but he \"chose me\". I started to shake. I texted Eliza who admitted she had feelings for him. I started to sob, the last thing I did was set up a call with the three of us. I told them that they should just date. I hung up and called Ashley, telling her everything. She said she told me so. I then recieved a call from John telling me that he was leaving me for Eliza. That they couldn't hide it anymore. They dated for 2 months after that, and she broke up with him because he tried to force her into having sex when she said no. \n\nHe has threatened me ever since, until I finally left my fathers and started seeing a therapist. Telling me that if I ever told anyone he would kill me or hurt someone i love. I finally told my mother and therapist what happened and I've been trying to get him charged ever since.\n\n\n\nI know this was long story, and a lot of you won't believe me, but I wanted to get it out there and finally try to move on. The texts and threats have been seen by my therapist and anything else he sent he deleted/I accidentally deleted out of fear he would hurt me. The amount of evidence I have, has been seen by authorities, but I don't feel I should post it here. I understand this may depleat any credibility I have in you believing me, but the point of this post was to get my story out there. I really do appreciate you taking the time to read this.

Now my BF and his NEX have been broken up for over a year, mutual friends are opening up not only about how they don\u2019t like her and the wrongs she\u2019s done to them- but also, sheepishly, how they now recognise that she didn\u2019t treat my BF well and they should have said something at the time.\n\nFor context, my BF is the sweetest, most easy going guy you could ever meet. He\u2019ll drop everything to help someone out. He wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly, It\u2019s incredibly difficult to make him angry and he never has a bad word to say about anyone.

My head started spinning and I grew ridiculously fearful. \nI tried just yesterday again and was unsuccessful when I was hit with a sudden dizzying headache and ringing that lasted 2-3 minutes. \n\nWhat I think of most are these two vague memories. I am outside of the bathroom in my basement. The door is open and I am watching him showering. Then I am on the counter in the bathroom and he is over me. I am not looking up. He is naked. I am not looking down. His hands are somewhere on me. Under me. I am staring at his chest. \nWhen linked to sexual experiences, these memories give me overwhelming distress. I freeze and cover or close my eyes and don\u2019t speak or look at my partner until my head stops spinning and I feel capable to move again. It feels very embarrassing. I feel guilt. \n\nI\u2019m making progress though. I got a bit of the tampon inside of me the other day before the fear/ringing/dizziness and I even almost had sex. Fingers are the worst.

What do you think?\n\nI have this co-worker who is like 65 years old. He's a korean immigrant who is still pretty old-fashioned. He started hitting on me last year and did progressively weird things that to me seemed like red flags. I may just be sensitive because of narc abuse, though. \n\nI made it clear I was married, but he didn't take the hint. He followed me every lunch and when I started leaving the grounds to get away, he started following me out, too. He followed me to a grocery store for lunch and got in line with me and insisted on paying. I kept saying no, but he ignored me and said no please let me pay for the nice lady. He pushed me out of the way and gave money to the teller. Then once he asked what my favorite pizza place was and I told him. I thought it was innocent, but he actually went there the next day and bought a damn pizza and brought it to work. He told me to go to the break room (I thought it was important, work-related). \n\nNope. He not only pushed me down into the chair with his hands, but offered me my favorite pizza. I wanted to be nice, so I said ok. I got up to make it and he said no, here let me. He took the pizza slices with his bare hands and put them into the microwave. then gave the plate to me. I didn't eat any place he touched. That's a huge pet peeve. He also put his hands on me a few times. He pretended it was friendly, but he knew I hate to be touched and I always pulled away. Once he even took my hands and put them around his throat. I was totally fucking weirded out. \n\nHe also sent me weird poetry via text even though I asked him not to text me because my hubby (who IS a narc) was extremely jealous and didn't want me texting other men. He got my number from the work's emergency number board. He never asked for it. He also kept asking me for pictures and I told him that's inappropriate and not work-related at all, my number was only for work emergencies.\n\nThere were a few other times when he asked me to do something and I was busy with work duties and I said I can't. He got really upset and acted depressed all day, and would act angry and standoffish with me. Just because I said \"no\". \n\nNow I noticed a few things I see as red flags. \n\n\\-1, he didn't respect my boundaries after I repeatedly asked him to stop touching me. \n\n\\-2, he forced me to sit when I wanted to leave. \n\n\\-3, he didn't let me have control over my own food, he did it for me like I was a child. twice. I don't need people to pay for me or serve me. \n\n\\-4, he could not take no for an answer without getting offended. \n\n\\-5, Texting me without permission even though I specifically asked him not to. \n\nI complained to a friend and she said it's just his culture and it's innocent. I really think he was giving off \\*\\*\\*extremely\\*\\*\\* controlling vibes. Eventually I kept avoiding him until he got the hint that I wasn't interested. He stopped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\---&gt; Now my main problem:\n\nI really think he's a covert narc, like my hubby. But I may be wrong. He's into another co-worker, my friend. She's a very naive 19 year old with very little experience with men and zero experience with abuse.

Both my parents are 5'8 and my mom is not a petite women and is active, but a little chubby, she around 210 pounds and is very strict. I'm 5'4 and Im around 115 pounds and Some of my first memories of my mother is that, she would always be yelling at my sister and using a belt to hit her on her back, so people wouldn't see the bruises. At the age 3, I remember saying \"no\" to my mother, in my mother's mind a child should never say \"no\" to their mother, so I would be put me in a empty room (room locked from outside)for one day and night with no food, while the family leave out of town. I always said \"no\", so I spend many days in the room. The main punishments I would receive was called the 5 minute game, which this punishment is where my mom would wreck our rooms by throwing items and pushing our shelves over and breaking as much stuff as possible while we would be standing in the middle of the room and watch. For 5 minutes would clean and once the alarm went off you would stop and stand in the hallway, which is were my mother would have a belt and she would use a belt for 5 minutes then we would have another 5 minutes to clean this punishment was received for a unorganized room. Another punishment was I would run on the back dirt roads until the sun when down I would recieve this punishment for poor manner and bad posture. The punishment I only recieve is to be left outside for the night with no jacket after having been drenched in water. Growing up me and my sibling were told emotion showed weakness and my mother told us to never tell anymore what happens at home. I hate to say it but I'm have attempted suicide, I never went to the hospital for my attempt.

I was devastated, tried all the self help tips online, and finally, stupidly decided to rebound. \n\nTo make things more complicated, I\u2019m rather submissive in the bedroom, with some masochistic tendencies. The guy I rebounded with was totally into all of that, and understood that I had just left a serious relationship and was mainly looking for sex, play, and a distraction. We had limits, a safeword, etc. we started very slowly, but things progressed. One night, he violated one of my hard limits. I used my safeword, and he did not stop. When he finished, we cuddled, and he apologized. Said it would never happen again. \n\nIt happened repeatedly over the next two months. Every time he would apologize afterwards, or say \u201cYou were really enjoying it, I could tell\u201d.  I began having panic attacks during \u201cplay\u201d. Sometimes he would stop, sometimes he wouldn\u2019t. I remember once, while he had me tied up and was using the cane on me, telling him that my hands were going numb. His response was \u201cAm I supposed to care?\u201d, and left them tied another 20 minutes. When he finally untied me, it took about 30 minutes before I could flex them open and shut again. \n\nIn relationships like this, consent and communication play a huge part, they are what separates them from abuse. But somehow I\u2019ve got the lines blurred. By violating my limits and ignoring my safeword, I withdrew consent. But by repeatedly going back, for 2 months, is that essentially giving consent? Knowing that he probably would go too far, since he had started too every time?\n\nI finally left for good the night he ripped the skin open on my back with a chain, hitting me with it over and over while I gasped and sobbed and begged him to stop. \n\nIt\u2019s been 3 months since.

Very grateful for what I have learned so far.\n\nI do still find it hard to recognize what is healthy vs. non-healthy in a new relationship when it comes to dating.  I'm finding it hard to move past a 2nd date when it comes to creating new bonds. Everyone in this world is different and I accept it now.  I truly enjoy learning new perspectives in the world in the people I meet these days.\n\nI've currently been in contact with a new woman, whom I've been texting/talking to for about 6 weeks or so. We've seen each other twice and i can feel the positive energy when we see each other (even had a bartender tell me when she got up to go to the bathroom while we met for drinks that we were having a good connection from her observation of the conversation), but I'm finding it hard to keep the connection when we aren't face to face.\n\nFor example, we don't text each other everyday, which I feel is healthy especially since this is so new to both of us and I believe we both should be comfortable in our independent lives if there is any hope for this being a real long lasting comfortable relationship.\n\nWhat has been on my mind though is I noticed I'm the one that is always initiating any conversation and/or meet up.  I'm beginning to feel she may not have the same developmental feelings, but at the same time I want to stay positive as it is still so early and we've only been talking for a small amount of time.\n\nI want to think she is being cautious and protecting herself (she is divorced and caught her ex lying to her about buying and taking prescription drugs).  She's been out of that relationship for over 3 years so she has gained independence and could very well still be working on herself and not one to rush into anything (neither do I). We also live about 45 minutes away from each other so it takes a little planning if we want to meet up and we can't simply meet up after work or on a weekend on a whim.\n\nAm I overthinking this? I got strong vibes of connection when we have seen each other both times, but she never reaches out for any reason when we aren't face to face.  I know it shouldn't make me feel insecure, but for whatever reason the feeling is starting to creep up a bit...\n\nUpdate: If anyone still reads this I confronted her after about a month of her never making time to meet up.  She insists our distance is the reason we haven't met up and it is holding her back. Then she went on to say (not her exact words) that she spends her weekends with friends and family and wants to date someone nearby during the week. Frankly, I know she is going to have a hard time with that mentality and I had to just walk away and let her be.

Those were her *exact* words, I was baffled and when I told her I was hurt by her trying to dictate my lifestyle and attacking me, as anyone would be, this first group of texts happened. \n\n- \u201cAnd now we\u2019re back to this.\u201d\n\n- \u201cHoly shit you did it again. You pick what you hear.\u201d\n\n- \u201cThat\u2019s not what I said so don\u2019t make up quotes\u201d\n\n- \u201cI GET IT. Can you hear that? I hear you I get it. It\u2019s done.\u201d\n\n- \u201cNo matter what I say it\u2019ll NEVER be good enough for you.\u201d\n\n- \u201cOkay master.\u201d\n\n- \u201cI\u2019m actually so done with this conversation right now.\u201d\n\n- \u201cKeep going, keep telling me how terrible I am I love it so much. Go on\u201d\n\n- \u201cThink whatever you want. Leave me if it\u2019s not good enough for you\u201d\n\n- \u201cIf I really make you feel like shit then divorce me. Clearly I just make you feel like fucking shit all the time because that\u2019s all I hear from you.\u201d\n\nMe, completely exhausted after nearly an hour of back and forth and texts like this: \u201cPlease stop\u201d\n\nHer: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do.\u201d\n\nThese next texts happened when we were talking over FaceTime (we were long distance at the time) and I don\u2019t remember what triggered it but she started screaming and cussing and absolutely losing it over the phone after something I said. It was the most traumatic fight we\u2019d had so far (and only got worse after that) and it was honestly like talking to the devil. That sounds dramatic but it\u2019s honestly the only way I can describe it. The rage in her voice and the blackness in her eyes still scares me to think about. It got so bad that I started having a full blown panic attack and had to hang up on her because she absolutely would not stop. \n\nAfterward she continued her tirade over text and here\u2019s some of those. At this point she was more upset about me asking her not to scream and cuss at me on the phone and saw it as \u201cdisrespectful\u201d for me to speak up. \n\n- \u201cAfter everything I\u2019ve done for you and all the bullshit I\u2019ve been through with you, I mess up one time compared to your hundreds of times and you have the nerve to treat me like this.\u201d\n\n- \u201cI\u2019m sending all your presents back, you don\u2019t deserve shit if this is how you\u2019re going to treat and speak to me. Say goodbye to $400 worth of presents\u201d (this was a month before Christmas)\n\n- \u201cLMFAOO are you serious right now? Take a good look in the mirror sweetheart. And look back at ALL the times you\u2019ve made me feel like shit over nothing\u201d\n\n- \u201cAnd I\u2019ve already apologized but clearly that\u2019s not good enough for the princess\u201d\n\n- \u201cMust be nice to be flawless right?\u201d\n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t re-visit this stuff but honestly it\u2019s all almost ingrained into my head word for word already because I remember every horrible thing she said. It\u2019s just that the more I heal, the more time passes, and the more distance that I get from her with NC, the way I perceive it becomes much different. I used to think it was my fault and that I deserved it and did something to provoke her. I still have those moments sometimes. But right now I read those texts and I wonder how I was capable of loving such a fucking monster and am in shock that I didn\u2019t recognize just how terrible it was. \n\nI don\u2019t have much else to say. I was already having flashbacks today and writing those out has me fucking anxious and on the edge of a panic attack but I\u2019ve never shared those here and hearing from you guys who have been through this always helps. I just can\u2019t believe it happened sometimes and in the moment I was blind to just how bad it was because I was just trying to survive. Looking back now I feel proud of myself for surviving it and healing every day but now I\u2019m able to see just how terrible it was and it takes my breath away sometimes seeing what a nightmare it was and that that was my life for 3.5 years.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It was a long distance romance that mostly existed over messenger. Long story short, after recent experiences and some thinking, I decided to contact his ex, which I was able to do with Facebook information. I did this with confidence that she would react this way which I can only justify by having read several books and feeling confident in myself based on the interactions. \n\nShe confirmed all my suspicions, and has been supportive. She and I compared timelines and lies about both of our experiences. He contacted her out of the blue while we were talking and she disclosed to him that I had contacted her (with my permission). he\u2019s behaving predictably by lying to her about things (saying he ended it, he did not, etc) because he wants her to support him, but she isn\u2019t, and also saying he thinks I\u2019m \u201cunstable\u201d because I did that. \n\nWe both know who his new \u201cflame\u201d is and we both feel bad for her. We haven\u2019t discussed contacting her, and I\u2019m on the fence about it. I have decided that I\u2019m going to hold off on that for now, depending on whether I feel safe, or whether I have a solid plan for what I would say and what avenue I\u2019d use to say it (anonymous or not). I have proof of both him lying about \u201cending things\u201d with me and him contacting me recently without me initiating any kind of meetup (I was in the area where he lives recently, he contacted me the day he knew I was arriving). \n\nI discussed this with my therapist today, and  she agreed I should only do anything I feel comfortable with.

I know the risks, feel free to say anything you feel, but primarily I\u2019m looking for others who have tried this and also potential ways I can talk to the new woman IF I feel ok about it. \n\nI want to make one thing clear: I am very much interested in changing the social landscape around this kind of thing. That does not mean I\u2019m encouraging anyone to do anything where they could be in danger. It means I\u2019m tired of the expectation that doing anything remotely like this automatically means someone is doing something wrong or gets tagged as crazy, dramatic, or unstable. I want to promote conversations like this, like I have done (because it takes examples of others doing it for people to follow suit). I contacted his ex because I felt safe and nearly certain she\u2019d corroborate my story. This is very complicated, but the narrative of \u201ccrazy/unstable\u201d etc around abusive behaviour needs some serious push back. \n\nLet me know your thoughts.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Sometimes, alone; sometimes, in pairs. One even stayed around a couple of hours staring at me in a garage eatery across the street, while I was tending the garden. I thought I was hallucinating because it's been a subtly tempered five years then this just whacked me out of nowhere. But my younger brother pointed out the times he saw them peering over the fence. A neighbor, much later on, had asked me how \"my friends\" were faring and then gushed on how they were so sweet to \"check up\" on me regularly. The eatery owner, too,  across the street mentioned them eating there a number of times asking her to \"keep an eye at me\" for them. It creeps me out that they were talking to other people as if we were still very close friends. It's like they didn't take advantage of my FLEAs. Or take big part on why I may not be able to finish college in my entire life.  It's like they're saying I'm tied to them for all my life and I owed them explanation of what I'd gone though in relation to my childhood which I didn't even understood and realized at that time.

English isn't my first language so I appologize for any typos I might make. I'll talk about some stuff in details. Also, it's pretty long...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI grew up with my mom, dad and brother (2 year younger than me) and later got a 2nd brother (10 year younger than me). \n\nI started uderstanding that my situation wasn't normal pretty early during elementary school but decided to not talk about it because I first wanted to fully understand what was wrong and what was okay in my parents' attitude before trying to do anything. At that time my dad and mom would spank me for small mistakes or when I asked them what the words I heard at school or in the street meant (words like 'sex', 'sexy', or insults) even though all I did was ask. But later my mom stopped.\n\n My dad would always ask for better grades no matter how hard I worked. In my country we are graded  /20, so it's impossible to get over 20 and a lot of teacher refuse to give 20 even if their are no mistakes (so the best you can usually get is 19), but the even the few times I managed to get 20 my dad would say 'Why didn't you get 21 ?' \n\nI tink the first time I tough about killing myself was in 3rd grade, I didn't really understood what dying really meant but I understood it as 'not being here anymore'. In 4th grade I actually tried wrapping something around my neck but stopped pretty quickly thinking my parents will be angry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut it got worst durring middle school. My dad started watching me by slightly oppening the door, he would come in front of the school to pick me up and threw stuff at me at home (shoes, water bottles, phones, ...) if I didn't do things as quikly as he wanted or the exact way he wanted.  \n\nHe once confiscated my phone for no reason, the next morning he couldn't find it and woke me up by kicking me asking me how did I dare taking it away why he was asleep... but I didn't. So me and my mom started searching  and found it next to his pillow, exactly were he had left it after taking it away. \n\nHe would also often ask me to come out with him. Once we were outside he would start singing my name out loud while holding me by the neck. People would laugh thinking he was a sweet and loving father while I would just pretend to smile but was actually dying inside and feeling ashamed. After some time I started refusing to go out with him. \n\nSince I was barelly allowed to get out, I spent all my time on the internet and started learning about depression, sex and all those thing we were forbiden to talk about at home. People were free to talk about the things they liked, to befriend the people they wanted and their wasn't anything considered 'taboo' in this world called internet. I didn't had a place I could call home in real life, so I builded a home for myself here. \n\nI barelly interacted with anyone in real life and spent all my time interacting with people on the internet, I made friends and found things I was passionate about. So during the night I would often spend a lot of time on my phone to ease myself and stop wanting to jump by the window. Instead of being sad all the time, I had something giving me hope and making me smile. \n\nEven tough my dad was throwing forks at me in real life because he didn't like the way I looked at him, I didn't care as long as I had this to escape. But my dad became more and more harsh, always using religion to defend his actions, my mom would always be on his side and the things that happened 3 or 4 times during the week started happening multiple times each day. \n\nHe took my phone away again, and this time asked for my password... He spent the night looking at it (I'm lucky because I always deleted everything just in case, so he didn't see my social media accounts)  I tried taking it back in the morning before going to school but he punched me. \n\nI always had a pretty good control over my emotions but this time I wasn't able to stop crying and went to school like that. I ended up talking to the counselor and she called my parents (only my mom came). \n\nI already knew this was a bad idea. When my mom cameback home she told me that the counselor told her to be more strict with me. She had told me she would call me again but she never did.\n\nWhen I asked for help I end up getting left behind and my parents find a way to make things turn in their favor, so I never did again. \n\nBut at least my dad only did physically hurt me occasionaly from there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy grades were so low I barelly passed to High School. \n\nThe 1st high school year was ... weird. My mom started pretending to care about my mental health and would always come and ask for me to talk with her... But how could I trust her when she took my father's side all those years and after all the horrible things she told me ? (I wish I didn't had kids, You're a monster, I did a mistake by giving birth to you ...)\n\nBut my grades didn't get better and teachers started doubting my future, so she got more and more angry at me. I ended up telling her 'I'm depressed and suicidal\" and she replied 'I don't see why you would be'\n\nI tough my mom was the only person I could relly on ... But when she said that I heard the sound of something breaking in my head \n\nEven the oldest of my two younger brothers is on their side and doesn't have the slightest amount of respect for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere I am today... I just ended 11th grade and I'll start 12th grade in a few months. I have social anxiety, I can't stand open doors and looking into my own eyes in the mirror, my heart beats way to fast all the time, I wake up at night from nightmares, I feel depressed, don't have a lot of energy and even hugs gives me anxiety because it makes me remember the way my dad put his hands on my back and neck, so my friends avoid touching me... but I have internet at least, my dad no longer takes my phone away. He still insults and yells at me but at least I don't get hit any... I would love to be able to think that\n\nBut now he hit my smallest brother instead... He is only 6 years old... I try to protect him, I ask him to stay with me... But he doesn't want to... He always goes back to his dad just like I used to when I was his age... \n\nAlso my dad still looks at my ass when I walk around the house, my memory from early childhood is kinda blury, I'm not sure if he ever sexually abused me or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't do anything about them, I've tried to make this house change but none of them is willing to. So I'm planning to leave once I'm 19 (curently 16) , I'm trying to get money but it's hard and my parents often takes it away because they don't have enough for the house and other stuff... \n\nI need to fly somewhere else, my father has friends everywhere here, they'll find me right away, and even if I ask for help I'll never be helped. In this country, single mothers who try to protect their kids from their sexually abusive father are taken to jail for not letting him see the child who will then be given back to him.\n\nSo I have to save myself on my own. \n\nI haven't tried to end my life since the end of 2017, I want to take a new start ... It will be hard but I'll find a way to escape somehow. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for reading me \\^\\^ I just wanted to get things out.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

This is because both of my parents are for the most part absent, although for different reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut our family is deeply broken, and tends to run on backwards logic. I've watched my grandmother blame her daughter for being raped as a child. When my little sisters and I were followed by a man out of a store, my family told me that it was normal and that I should have felt flattered, not disgusted or afraid. I've had to hold an aunt back before she could bash her brother's head in with a hammer. I've watched a relative puke up blood and stomach tissue moments after she begged me to call the ambulance (and after her sisters told me to just ignore her). Recently, a young cousin of mine shot his best friend outside a club. These things are everyday news.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can imagine, verbal abuse is also pretty common in our family. As a kid, I could expect to be yelled at, criticized, or demeaned for *anything*, even if it was tame and normal. Speaking the wrong way, liking or not liking a particular food or kind of music, dreaming to be this or that as a child - literally anything was subject to being quickly criticized at great length. And there were no boundaries: I've been backed into a corner and told that I never understood my dead biological parent. After making (what I thought was) an innocent and normal comment to a cousin at a holiday get-together, an aunt shot a look at me from across the room and - in front of everyone - demanded to know if I was gay. I developed the habit of apologizing profusely over everything because I could never be too sure if what I was doing was right or wrong, even if it was something as simple as standing in a certain area of a room.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also a little bit '*touched*', in the southern sense of the word.  This means that I got a few extra lashings - being told that I was weak, that I wouldn't go as far in life as my siblings would and the like.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm now an adult, and several hundred miles away from family. But I still hear their voices. I was afraid to take out the trash this morning because a nonsensical, irrational part of me expected my housemates to ridicule me for doing it at that moment. As I scrubbed down our messy bathroom, a voice assured me that everyone would think I'm stupid for doing so. Wherever I go or whatever I do, my instinct is to expect that someone is closely watching me, and preparing to lash out at me at any moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want to be free. I don't know how to tell confused friends that I literally cant tell right from wrong (or socially inappropriate from appropriate), and that part of me is afraid that they will quickly turn on me.   I'm not sure what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** Grew up heavily criticized in an unstable family.  Afraid that anything and everything I do will get me in trouble or hated.

My parting words were that I couldn't make him go, he had to want to improve his behavior himself. Silence. This was after gushing texts and tearful words of how he will always love me and wants to stay friends. After introducing me to his family. After telling me he wants to move in with me. After offering to help move my possessions out of storage and across the country.\n\nI still miss him. I hate that I still miss him. There are days the pain derails me. There are days it feels like a dream and never happened. I will see a picture of him on my phone (I know), and his face is both familiar and devoid of any recognition. Who is that guy?  I used to look at him with such love and such feelings of contentment. My soul mate! I found him! And he was wonderful! I had never been happier.\n\nBut then I also remember the tears, and the incredulousness at some of the things he did and said: The silent treatments, the gaslighting, the emotional unavailability. Both his and my excuses and rationalizations for his shitty behavior. Then the shock and hurt at his words of my \"brokeness\". He went from being one of the most important people in my life to a stranger, overnight.\n\nI have a mantra that I repeat when I catch myself thinking about him: \"I miss him. It's okay to miss him. But I didn't love him, I loved the way he made me feel. I wanted him in my life but he doesn't want to be in my life.\" And whether he is a narc or just a fuckboy, he doesn't want to change and I can't force him to be in a relationship with me. I lost friendships over this man. I lost pieces of myself. Isn't that enough? How many more examples do I need to prove to myself he is a lost cause and I deserve better? \n\nDespite the healing and missing him less, he is still in my thoughts. I can't get him out of my head or heart. I love too deeply, and am too forgiving. I see an actually broken person. I know I can't fix him. But I care so much. Too much. Therapy helps, but not enough.

I ended up in a mental health hospital one night because I thought I was going to loose my mind. After months and months of struggling to even have the ability to get up and make myself some food, I decided to give Zoloft a try. I really didn\u2019t think it would help me at all, especially with my brain overpaying all the emotional abuse. \n\nI have now been on Zoloft for roughly 2 months, and it has extremely helped me. I brain rarely replays those ptsd moments, if anything- it gave me the courage to walk away and never look back. I have more energy now and am able to live a normal life. Yes, I still do miss him sometimes and I still get sad. and that might not go away soon, but one day it will . I am doing so much better, so for anyone thinking about giving  an anti-depressant a chance after narcissistic relationship if you seem depressed and not well, I recommend it. \n\n( p.s. I am not a psychiatrist but I know for a fact that sometimes you need to try a few different SSRIs before finding one that works with the chemicals in your brain. Everyone is different, there is no 1 formula, I found Zoloft to work for me only after trying Prozac and mirtazipine. Stay patient, sometimes it takes time.)", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I didn\u2019t realize that I was in a narcissistic abusive relationship until a couple days ago. I\u2019ve known my ex fianc\u00e9 since 2010. We\u2019ve been on and off since 2010 and have been together for the last three years. We were about to get married in August.\n\nLast week everything escalated into a really big argument. It was one of those rock-bottom moments where I couldn\u2019t walk away and just brush it off. I don\u2019t want to go into all the details but let\u2019s just say there is a lot of manipulation and shaming after the escalation and argument from my nex. Luckily my parents were able to come to my rescue the night of the incident and stay with me the next day. The next morning it was as if the scales came off my eyes and my parents were really concerned. They said they had been holding back a lot of concerns about the way that my nex had treated me and them. The lies. The manipulation. The disrespectful way my nex had treated me in front of my friends/family. His gossiping behind my back. His callousness. \n\nBefore the fight, I had had second thoughts about whether it was right to marry him. For the last year he\u2019s hated that I got sober and started going to AA. He tried many different ways to get me to stop going to AA. Luckily I\u2019m strong enough and kept my friendships in AA. He hates that I go to church. A couple weeks ago he said that he hated everything about my faith. That he would never accept my faith or that part of me. Earlier last week he said that because I had a conservative viewpoint I was a white supremacist. It seemed that whenever I stood up for something that I believed in, he would dig his heels in and convince me that I was wrong or that I was mentally ill because I had faith in God.\n\nI now know that as a classic narcissist he likes to \u201ccreate chaos \u201cfor the fun of it. He openly told me that he likes to pick fights with me because it was fun for him. he told me that he liked to have fights with me and argue with me so that he could ultimately \u2018straighten me out\u201d. He was always right and never wrong. Over the last year he started to withhold affection and refused to sleep in the same bed with me. He preferred to sleep on the couch. And he would find every excuse in the book to not sleep in the same bed with me. He was always on his phone. Even when I was trying to talk with him he would be on his phone. The list goes on and on....\n\nIt\u2019s so crazy because I never realized that I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. I always thought that it was just \u2018him being him\u2019 and nothing more. It\u2019s so crazy how you can tolerate mistreatment for so long. It wasn\u2019t until my parents confronted me the other day and I looked into the definition of emotional abuse and realized \u2018oh my god this is me this is my life.\u2019 Now when I look back at our entire relationship it makes so much sense. The little moments on their own didn\u2019t make sense but when you look at it through the lens of narcissistic abuse everything makes sense.\n\nI texted him today and told him it was over and told him that I didn\u2019t want to have any contact with him. He texted me back a long sappy text message about how much he loved me but I\u2019m going to try to hold this boundary and have no contact. There are so many personal things that I can\u2019t share on this subreddit. As I\u2019m sure you guys can relate there are so many little moments where a narcissistic partner can just be out of line or rude or mean or dismissive etc. \n\nSo now I\u2019m here picking up the pieces. Luckily I have a supportive family and a lot of friends. Luckily he didn\u2019t totally isolate me. I know I need to find a counselor and start working through all of the tangles in my mind. This shit fucks you up. \n\nI just think God that I didn\u2019t marry him. That we don\u2019t have kids together. That it was just three or six years not 30 or 40 years that I wasted with him. I hope that I can find somebody in the future that really loves and cares about me. And nurtures me not ignores me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

While my mom might have around 3 beers a day, she never ends up angry or abusive but my dad does. He drinks around 7-9 beers a day and gets extremely angry and abusive towards me, my mom, and my sister. I get most of it though because my sister is his favorite. I\u2019m 17 and my sister is 13. The reason she\u2019s his favorite is because she does whatever he asks without a fight but I will fight back because he constantly treats us like maids. My mom works Monday through Friday but my dad only works on the weekends so me and my sister end up alone with him a lot. He wakes us up whenever he wakes up, it could be 7am or it could be noon. We never know. He says it\u2019s because we\u2019re lazy and need to work to be allowed to stay in this house. \n\nThat brings me to what happened a few days ago. So me and my sister needed to go to our grandmas house (his mom) to spend the night because my uncle was out of town and she can\u2019t be left alone in case she falls or hurts herself on accident. My father knew this but he woke us up at 10am and kept yelling at us to do a whole bunch of yard work. We told him that we needed to go to our grandmas house because we were supposed to leave right when we woke up but he yelled and said that she can take care of herself (which she can\u2019t due to back issues and other health issues) and that we were just making up an excuse. Now I can\u2019t drive due to the fact that our cars aren\u2019t the best working cars so I couldn\u2019t just get in my dad\u2019s car and drive us there so I called our mom and told her what was going on and she came and got us because she knew we needed to go and we snuck out and left. My dad became furious but he only became furious at me of course and he texted me and told me he was going to throw my cat outside (she\u2019s been an inside cat her whole life so she wouldn\u2019t be able to survive being outside) and that he was packing up all my stuff to sell and that I wasn\u2019t allowed back into the house. I called my mom and told her what happened but she was still at work so didn\u2019t know if any of it was true. I started having a mental breakdown and told my grandma what was going on. She tried to calm me down and told me that \u201cit was just because he was drinking\u201d which is always everyone\u2019s reason for what he does. \u201cIt\u2019s just because he was drinking\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s just because he\u2019s off his medication\u201d. It doesn\u2019t matter why he did it, it matters that he did it either way. So a few hours later when my mom got home, she told me he didn\u2019t do anything that he said he did but he kept telling her how they shouldn\u2019t have had kids and kept insulting me and I could hear him from the background of the phone call insulting everything about me. It really hurt me. He\u2019s insulted me plenty of times before but it never stops hurting. So the next day we went home from my grandmas house and it was Friday so my dad was at work and didn\u2019t get off until 8pm. I stayed in my room like I always do and I heard him talking to my sister like everything was fine, until he saw me walk out of my room. Then he started freaking out, yelling at me, throwing stuff, and telling me I wasn\u2019t allowed in his home. He kept punching my wall and telling me that he would kill me the next time he saw me if I didn\u2019t leave by tomorrow which terrified me. My mom started an argument with him until he left and I was a crying mess. She tried to calm me down but it didn\u2019t work and she eventually left. \n\nNow fast forward to today. He got off from work and I didn\u2019t leave my room or show any sign that I was home in fear that he would try and kill me. Then he barged into my room and apologized for what he did but I asked him to explain what he was sorry for because I wanted an actual apology instead of just \u201csorry for earlier\u201d but he told me that he didn\u2019t have to do that since it was his house and that it was my fault he was so mad anyway. I asked him how it was my fault and he said it was because I didn\u2019t buy him anything for Father\u2019s Day. 1.) I\u2019m poor. I have no money that I could have used to buy him anything and 2.) he has never bought me anything for Christmas or my birthday. He bought me a speaker last Christmas but made me give it to him a few hours later because he decided he wanted it instead. He\u2019s selfish and heartless. It then led to me yelling at him about how much pain he\u2019s caused me and how he\u2019s the reason for my depression and how suicidal I am which then resorted in him throwing a shoe at me and telling me that I hurt him way worse by not buying him anything. He compared the abuse he\u2019s given me for years to him not getting a materialistic item. That hurt. Later I found out the only reason he tried to apologize in the first place was because he wanted something. That\u2019s the only time he\u2019ll ever apologize for anything is if he wants something. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the worst he\u2019s done to me but it doesn\u2019t make it hurt any less. I might post more stuff as it happens or write more about past stuff he\u2019s done to me but I just needed to rant about what he\u2019s done to me just this past week. \n\nSorry this was pretty long but thanks for letting me rant here and thank you to anyone who read all of that.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Didn't go well.", "author": "Mechanicalpinstrap", "self_text": "I used to do gymnastics and me and other children my age got abused. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe\u2019d generally get hit (open palm or a thin whip-like bush branch) if we fell off whatever apparatus we were on (uneven bars/beam), or if we didn\u2019t stick the landings, or if we were so tired we just stopped \u00a0(we\u2019d get hit in order to continue and not allowed to rest). Things like that. \n\nThe worst part of it wasn\u2019t even when we got hit, for me it was when we were yelled at. I was between 6-9 at the time so I wasn\u2019t really fully understanding what was happening to begin with to be honest, not as I do now. \u00a0I just remember them screaming being absolutely frightening. There were multiple coaches that did this, but I had like the 3rd\u00a0worst coach, there were 2 others that were incredibly bad.\n\nAside from being hit and yelled at, I remember us being shamed for small things as well. I\u2019d generally be called fat all the time and that left me with a lot of body image issues. I know there\u2019s the meme of \u2018 big boned not fat\u2019 but I am genuinely big boned. I used to have a 6 pack when I was a child because of the intensive training. I\u2019m more muscular than fat, so I weighed a lot more than the other girls so even at my skinniest, because I was bigger, I was fat. \n\nWe would also be shamed for small things. The only memory I have is being ridiculed for not knowing a word properly. I was like 8. Give me a break. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne time I fractured one of the bones in my arm and I was only allowed to recover for 3 weeks before I was made to go back on the uneven bars. I didn\u2019t stop going to training sessions while I had my arm in cast either, and whenever I told them it hurt they would call me a liar, hit me, ask me if I thought they were stupid and that I could trick them, and punish me.\n\nThey also wouldn\u2019t let us drink water whenever we were thirsty, only before and after starting training on an apparatus. I guess this was to not have us throw up (which I actually did once), but because we were all just so thirsty we would sometimes use water from the spray bottles. The spray bottles were used to take off the magnesium build up on the uneven bars (we used to use magnesium on our palms in order to not rip the skin on our palms, which happened sometimes anyway. My first one was incredibly painful to the point I couldn\u2019t do anything with that hand.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhenever they yelled at us, if we talked back, we got hit. So the general practice was\u2026 when you were being yelled at, you put your head down and took it. This thing has followed me into adulthood and when I have an argument with my partner now, I generally can\u2019t bring myself to genuinely talk back, my mind goes black, I freeze, and it takes me anywhere between 5-15 minutes to get myself to say anything. Luckily my partner is understandable. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can almost hear you thinking \u201c Did the parents not know? \u201c\n\nYeah, they did. They all knew about what happened but I don\u2019t think they knew the extent. This didn\u2019t happen in the UK, or USA where there\u2019s laws against hitting children, and if anyone\u2019s caught you get sent to jail. This was happening in an eastern country around 2000s. The general thought pattern was \u2018 the more they scream at my child, the more they care\u2019. Which yeah, I can see it happen, but at the same time I don\u2019t think it was healthy for any of us, and I\u2019m pretty sure that everyone that went through that probably has some difficulties with things in their adulthood because of them. I haven\u2019t kept in touch with any \u00a0of my colleagues from there. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can\u2019t hold it against my mom for knowing and wanting me to succeed. I was good at what I was doing but in the end my grandmother took me out of it because when she\u2019d try to pet my head I would flinch away because I was expecting her to hit me. The thing that made her take me out was when my original coach left for a better country, I was left with the meanest of the coaches. Within a week she hit me twice and gave me an actual beating the third time. \n\nWhat happened on the third time was that I was tired, she kept making us go between 2 sets of uneven bars, so instead of giving us time to rest she would make us go from one to the other. And I did that twice, and the 5th\u00a0time I had to do a full exercise on one of the bars, I had to stop because I couldn\u2019t breathe. So she got mad at me, called me a liar, grabbed my by the arm and hit me in the back with both open palm and fist and I think she then punished me by making me go do physical exercises (the kind where you build muscle. We\u2019d usually do these at the end of the session, and those were another can of worms).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was horrible, and that was most of my childhood. When I quit gymnastics, I started gaining weight and then got bullied by both students and one of the teachers. God, she was a cunt. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m considering going to see a therapist but I\u2019m not sure what would actually happen regarding this.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

You can call me Alorxico and I am looking for support.  I am looking for a reminder that I am loved and mean something.\n\nSee, long ago, back when I was in college, I was in an abusive relationship.  Mental, emotional and sexual abuse were common but in never got physical.  There were never any marks so I assumed that meant I was not a victim.  He controlled every aspect of my life for 6 years before I up and left.  I moved far away, got a new job and started a new life.\n\nI met a man.  He was sweet and funny and kind.  We shared a lot of the same passions and hobbies and we fell in love.  We got married and we were happy.  Then he hurt himself fixing our roof.  He had two major surgeries and was on medical leave for over a year.  It was tough.  The meds he was on made him violent and he would say horrible things to me.  But I thought \u201cthat\u2019s the meds talking.  That\u2019s not him.\u201d\n\nThen the doctor told him he could go back to work.  He went back with his note and asked when he could\nget back to it.  They fired him right then and there as he was no longer protected by his medical condition.\n\nThat was 3 years ago.  Since then he has jumped from job to job, always quitting just before he can qualify for benefits or retirement plans because he\u2019s being \u201cbullied\u201d by his coworkers.  Every time he talks about his day, he shouts.  He yells and slams things, throws things.  We have a cat.  If the cat annoys him by scratching furniture or trying to scratch him, he hits him.  He says that is how you teach them not to do what they are doing.\n\nI have tried to be there for him, I have listened and offered insight but he just keeps yelling.  He says yelling is how he vents.  It is scary, it reminds me of my former abuser.  But I tell myself \u201cit is the stress.  This is not him.\u201d\n\nAfter 3 years of hell, I have fallen into a pit of depression.  I am numb.  I don\u2019t want to be near him or talk to him because all he does is yell.  He has started calling me useless, saying I never want to do anything because I am lazy.  When I ask if he wants to do something he says we can\u2019t because we are broke then buys a hands full of video games.\n\nWe live in a trailer that is falling apart.  It has a mold infestation that is making me sick.  The water pipes are bursting and the roof leaks.  We were set to buy a house, a beautiful ranch.  He canceled the contract last minute saying we could not afford it.  He then went out and bought trading cards.\n\nLast night, my depression hit bad and I shut down at a gathering of friends.  I felt nothing, I could not talk or look at anyone.  I went to the bathroom to cry, hoping that would help but it didn\u2019t.  After dinner he snapped at me, demanding to know what was wrong.  So I started to tell him and he started yelling.  When I told him yelling at me hurts me, he got out of a moving car and started walking home.  I called friends, told them what happened and asked for back up.\n\nThey all went to him.  They all went to talk to him and support him.   I was left alone in our trailer for 3 hours waiting for him to come home with no one to talk to.  When they finally brought him home, they all left and the yelling started.  Everything was my fault.  I don\u2019t listen and that causes stress, I don\u2019t sleep at the same time he does (I\u2019m a night owl and function better when I sleep during the day) and that causes stress, we have not had sex since the yelling intensified last year and that causes stress, I put the drawings my kindergarteners give me on our refrigerator and it causes stress, I don\u2019t let him grope or fondle me when ever he wants and that causes stress.\n\nI apologize and try to tell him he\u2019s scaring me and yelling hurts, that he has called me horrible things and I am depressed.  \u201cI\u2019m depressed too but you get fucking over it and move on!\u201d he shouts \u201cand stop taking things so fucking personally!  I\u2019m not yelling at you!  You always do this!  You shut down and it pisses me off!\u201d\n\nI told him I loved him several times during the fight.  He never said it to me.  Told him I was sorry.  He never said it to me.  He then went to bed and fell straight to sleep, snoring.  I was not allowed to sleep on the couch because not sharing the same bed causes him stress.\n\nSo, I have not slept.  I have had to remove my drawings, I have to change me sleep schedule and I have to let him yell at me when ever he wants.  There is a small part of me that keeps saying \u201che\u2019s right, this is all your fault\u201d but I know it is wrong.  I am not blameless, I have not been good at communicating, but I should not be yelled at.  No one should be yelled at.  No one should be afraid of their spouse.\n\nSo, that\u2019s my story.  I\u2019m not looking for sympathy, I just need to know I am not alone.  I need to know there are others out there who understand.  Advise is always welcome, but I get a lot of that from my parents and brothers, but they live 3000 miles away so can\u2019t really be here when I need them.\n\nThanks for listening to me.\n\n~ Alorxico", "subreddit": "abuse"}

{"post_id": "c7exst", "created_utc": 1561905410, "title": "One-Year Anniversary of My Ex Meeting His New Soulmate", "author": "stevenjs2480", "self_text": "This weekend marks the one-year anniversary of my ex-partner meeting the person he'd leave me for two months later, setting into motion his discard of me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd, reflected upon everything, I couldn't be happier to have him out of my life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was a couple of weeks shy of turning 28 years old, and he was my first relationship. Hell, I even came out of the closet to my family so they could meet him in an honest way. Before meeting him, I was (and am) an introverted person, and I've always been comfortable with my own company and have a life full of interests, passions, and hobbies. When I met him everything felt perfectly right. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUntil, of course, everything started to feel very wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was officially with my ex for five years and seven months, and it was a challenge beyond all challenges maintaining the relationship. But I was absolutely determined to hold the thing together to prove to the world (and ultimately myself) I was capable of hanging on to someone. Never once did my own health and and inner peace factor into this equation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI noticed the early red flags: the road rage, the DELUGE of texts and FaceTime calls, the rapidly rotating moods, the mean-spiritedness, the hypersensitivity, the angry competitiveness, and this really uncomfortable trait of not seeming to recognize and/or care about my feelings or position on anything. This defining trait I not recognize as a lack of empathy, and one of the key traits of narcissistic behavior. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was also his tumultuous relationship history full of infidelity on his part, but it was the fault of everyone else and he was pushed to it, and this fixation on his appearance and sense of masculinity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, hey, I equated it all to a passionate and masculine guy who excited me beyond anything I experienced. Sure, I had the lows of worrying if I upset him (which I did often, with no effort at all), worrying if I WAS going to upset him (which was completely unpredictable so I was always on alert), and relishing the times when I was the center of his attention. The psychological anguish was worth those few highs -- which became fewer and fewer along as well as less and less potent -- right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOpen relationships are somewhat typical in gay relationships. Sometimes they work when both partners are respectful, and sometimes they don't when the respect is lacking or missing. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot only was any kind of respect missing from my narcissistic relationship, but it was a great deficit. My partner went from wanting to spend the rest of his life with me because I was \"the one\" he was \"looking for his entire life,\" to a dirtbag with a wandering eye who loved flaunting it at every opportunity. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the years the \"rules\" of our open relationship changed in his favor more and more, and I felt this nerve-racking anxiety I could not shake until it got to the point where he'd go out with people during \"our time\" and even spend weekends away because I was smothering him and he was allowed to have time to himself. And I put up with it because I was terrified of loosing him. As Doctor Ramani said, it's all about hope and fear. I hoped he'd eventually start caring about me the same way I cared about him and change, and I was desperately afraid of loosing him because I was convinced he was my \"one\" too.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, one year ago this weekend, we went to a gay campground where my ex met a rather plain and uninteresting person. I wasn't attracted to him, but I drunkenly green-lit a threesome. After that night, my partner verbally attacked me when I told him he was behaving way too intimately with the guy and gaslit me into believing it was my fault for not paying enough attention to him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that weekend, he began working on me to go away with this guy for a weekend alone, at the end of July 2018, at the campground. My ex also began shopping around for campers to have a perm site there (he is beyond irresponsible with money, and when I wasn't stressed about sex, I was stressed about money). I stood my ground for weeks until he more or less told me he was going because he \"needed to get it out of \\[his\\] system\" because he \\[only wanted to be with \\[me\\].\" \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, I asked him in a moment of clarity if he just wanted to break it off completely and end the relationship, and he panicked and said not and reassured me. So, I broke and allowed it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWant to guess how this turned out? He went, and his mood changed to utter darkness. I even went on a family vacation with him two weeks before he dumped me, and he was so cold and distant. As I still say, I remember seeing his back to me the entire time. Very rarely would he talk to me. I wanted to die, and I fell into a depression where I lost over 30 pounds. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so, he eventually did dump me, and one week later I found out, officially, it was for this person. This guy also had a long history of cheating and his partner of 14 years kept taking him back. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was so addicted to my ex, though, that I made an arrangement where we lived together still, because I didn't have anywhere to go, and he didn't either, so it worked out for him. He carried on his long-distance relationship with this guy, and still had me there during the week. I allowed it all because I was broken and weak and confused and I didn't know how to survive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe didn't make it easy. I saw him in pure ecstasy as he carried on this \"relationship,\" behaving as he did when he was with me in the beginning. Suicide was a very answer to all of this emotional trauma. I work in Manhattan, and I'd go up to the twelfth floor and just stare over the edge, thinking how easy it would be to end it all, since I wasn't worthy for his love anymore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it wasn't for my therapist, a strong core set of friends who saw through his bullshit, books, blogs, and Youtube, I might have just ended it all, and I'm very serious. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't get into all of the weird and cruel stuff he did to me while we lived together in the post-breakup relationship. Maybe I'll write about it in a new post. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut I eventually found a new apartment, and he moved two-and-a-half hours away from the city, and is commuting in a few days a week and is working from home the rest of the time. He moved very close to his family, which is the route of all his own personality pathologies, and still was two-and-a-half hours away. He's renting a huge house with a new list of bills that's all beyond his means. I am back to living a quieter, simpler life within my means. I managed to pay off my student loans with him now gone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was hard when I first moved out, but got much easier as time passed. He was very much interested in maintaining a friendship with me, but I have not heard from him much since moving. I now understand with total clarity that if and when I do hear from him, it's only because he wants something from me, and not because he has developed a deeper understanding of anything. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm enjoying my company once again, I cherish my freedom, and I am thankful beyond words that I've found my love for books, movies, video games, writing, exercise, cooking, now that I am able to do so without taking care of him and worrying about his next move. Therapy was vital for surviving my living situation with him, and for understanding what the relationship truly was and why it happened to begin with. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't genuinely say that at this point in my life, I'm thankful to be single, living alone, and free of my narcissistic ex. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wanted to share all of this for those of you who are going through this. I didn't think I'd survive, heal, grow, and appreciate having him gone. I thought I'd be the exception to the rule. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wasn't. I did the work, and I'm better for it. You will be too, but you MUST feel the feelings, understand them, and develop a relationship with yourself. Exercise, read, write, cook, meditate -- whatever you can practice some quiet mindfulness with. You will get there, but don't fight getting there. Take it not one day at a time, but one minute at a time in the beginning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEPILOGUE: I should note that being discarded for another person is DEVASTATING, and I was convinced my ex would change for this person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe wasn't given the chance. The person my ex left me for dumped him at the end of May and went back to his partner of 14 years. Since that's happened, I have not heard from him, I have no interest in reaching out to him, and I am editing down friends and common contacts because I don't want to be reminded of him, nor do I want him seeing into my life.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Spoiler alert none of this has happened he has gotten worse over the years.\n\nTypes of abuse I have suffered note this isnt a definitive list just what i observed/remember and what white ribbon australia tells me \n\nPhysical -&gt; throwing stuff at me, smashing a window with a knife, pushing me and mum, Physical restraint at one time, pulling my hair, councillor says slamming doors is abuse and boy does he do that a lot, kicking the dog. \n\nFinancial -&gt; monitors what mum spends, since he took control of the food shopping my food gets forgotten like my lunches, not sure if its one but most of our expenses go to beer and tobacco and also not sure but he is always complaining that i dont buy my own food/wants keep my mum doesnt think i should pay whether it is because im away or that he wants keep to go up higher than my pension like a 50% increase when i didnt get that much extra from getting on my pension. Not sure if it counts Expects me to pay mum for petrol even if shes surprising me with a lift home/sets a minimum limit on what i can spend on mum eg 80 when mum would kill me if i spent over 40 on her.\n\nEmotional -&gt; blaming me and mum for everything, always in a bad mood, intentionally embarasses mum at the pub and once made me seem stupid to his bar mates(i wanted to do my online test for uni next to the router since router = strongest signal, he called me a liar, said the internet doesnt work like that and his bar friends agreed with him. Ive done computer science for 3 years in high school and im the one who is always called for tech support when hes broken something),name calling such as dingdong(his favourite) and bitch or dirty dog and lazy fucking cow(the last two he has called me tonight), sort of telling me what to wear like hes started saying are you going out in that or something similiar, has threatened online intimidation and humiliation like if we divorce ill post on facebook that you kicked me out and that your a dirty person about mum and ill post pics of your dirty pigsty of a room about me.\n\nVerbal -&gt; name calling, continuous criticism, swearing ,humiliation, attacks on me and mums body and intelligence and mums parenting(hes literally never fully raised a child let alone a disabled peep like yours truely) and yelling. He literally does all of the ones listed on the webpage... On multiple times a week basis even if he hasnt been in an absolute shitty...\n\nSocial abuse-&gt; he grounded me for two weeks at age 20 because my room was messy(i literally didnt have enough space in my room cause of christmas). It could be argued that he moved us away from friends and family(he made us move house and the only house we could afford was near the edge of the metro area.)\n\nSexual -&gt; well its none of my business but he makes sexual jokes at dinner(like Having sex with his high school teacher), it could be argued assaulting the genitals if nipples are classed as genitals cause womens ones are obscene cause he used to put clothes pegs on mums nips as a joke, it could be argued unwanted exposure to porno(he got drunk and was showing mum his penis and pulled down his pants too far to show his testes and i was mistaken for mum), i do know they dont have sex but i dont know if its used as reward or punishment. \n\nStalking-&gt;did this more at the old house a few years ago like mum had a restraining order against my stepdad  for a few months in 2014/15 and i recall him loitering around the house at one point at night\n\nSpiritual-&gt; i dont think it counts but he says hes a buddist faithful like you cant show him souls of feet or touch his head but i read buddists cant drink or smoke.\n\nImage based-&gt; hes taken photos of my room being messy and threatened to put them online. sure they arent intimate but he says its to show facebook how much of a slob i am and he had no permission to take photos of my room. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese arent listed in a category but they are worth noting.\n\nWalks into my room when im away and makes excuses about why hes in there. (Thats whats gotten me in this state.) Last two times ive gone out with mum hes done it, its getting more frequent. \n\nHes looked through my phone before because it rung and looked through my messages on it where im complaining about it because \"the phone was on and thats what showed up\",i sleep mode my phone when its on charge.\n\nHe restricts what i can talk about like talking about video games , my boyfriend(which i do everything with so i cant talk about my day)footy, my footy team, asking for advice, uni and anything he finds boring. \n\nTurns the internet off for what he counts as being naughty. Classic examples of me being naughty include me being right(we got in an argument because apparently women cant be scouts despite my best friend and her sister was in scouts and has been since they were little, i was apparently dictating to home) and me apparently dictating to everyone to shut up cause i was doing a etest for uni in the kitchen(routers in kitchen for strong signal my room signal is near nonexistant)\n\nBeing a hypocrite like he can do things we cant. Me and mum cant eat on the couch, he can. He can smoke in the house mum couldnt when she smoked. Both of which he said specifically said noone can do when we got the couch and moved. Like i leave a glass of cordial n the side because im expecting to drink some later since i cant bring drinks in my room, i get scolded for attracting ants, meanwhile halfeaten food is left on the side or dirty dishes with sauce on them every night. \n\nLies constantly and when hes caught wont admit it. Like hes lied about pushing me. We caught him lying once since he put the wrapper for a crunchie back in the candy bowl, mum has fake teeth and cant get her teeth through them and I don't like them. Seemed to blame me still because when i grabbed a dairy milk he asked where i was going to put the wrapper.\n\nDemands i clean my wardrobe and drawers despite having nothing to do with them.\n\nI called him out on being an abuser and be made me apologise because it has different meanings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nContext\n\nAs i said before my folks split in 2014/2015. After christmas he was pissy. He threw a lighter at of me at a train station so i whacked him with my towel(we had gone to the beach and he didnt enjoy himself lets just say) so he slapped me on the back of the head so we ran off and caught the bus home without him. A few days later he got drunk and threatened to set me and mum on fire  and threw a knife which smashed our window so we called the cops who told me and mum to stay at my aunties. Mum ended up putting a restraining order on him. I recall him skulking around the house threatening to break the windows with rocks. Mum ended up removing the restraining order a few months later cause she missed him. He had two conditions to moving back in, read up on autism(he doesnt think its real and thinks its an excuse for being lazy, i'm autistic if you can't tell) and quit booze(he was sober during the split since he didn't have money for beer being homeless in the city)\n\nHes done neither and the hospital told him specifically quit alcohol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIm so sick of my stepdad trying to run my life, i can count on one hand how many times he has complimented me for something good ive done. I got suicidal because ive begged mum to get rid of him but she wont until x happens or that hes been acting good lately or that he is depressed/in pain with his knee or he bullies her too. Today was the last straw, my bedroom door was closed so he specifically opened it hecause \"it stunk\", mum says it doesnt stink and even if it did i cant help it because its probably my stomach issues and two that doesnt give him a reason to walk in. Ive asked politely for him to stop but he can \"go into anyone rooms he wants, its his house\"(his name isnt on the deed and mum married him after mum got my old house as inheritance). I walked in after a disappointing loss with the footy and the internet was off and he was yelling at mum about how im a dirty cow and shit. I can't have any privacy. I'm scared to leave my room in case he walks in and invades my privacy. The only escape feels like death. Mum won't let me move out. Stepdad ignores everything we say so we cant tell him off. Mum wont kick him out because he would be homeless or would burn the house down or change the locks. I am at my literal wits end.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you need aught clarifying or translated(i use a lot of british slang and not realise it and people cant understand me lol)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you made it this far thanks for reading.

I've spent all my years second guessing it everyday, trying to convince myself whether I'm overthinking it or not. Today, I have taken a step in facing it and understand that I was abused. Not anything physical though, just really psychological and emotionally abused. I use to think that was the normal for many people until I've met other friend's families or people in general that didn't do abusive things. My whole life, I always wondered why I could get up and stand strong. I get it now, for a start. Little by little, I've allow my myself to become so low with others that I eventually lose myself in the process. Fortunately for me, I've beared the brunt of being who I truly am and know how to accept this. I'm getting back into my hobbies and beginning to have a bit more happiness unlocked from this hell, one second, one minute, one hour and one day at a time.

I\u2019m not sure if I am in the wrong like he says, or what? The entire thing feels off, I want some outside opinions.... sorry in advance for the long post.\n\nFor background, he would keep saying things after we broke up like that he had to work hard so that in the future he would be able to support me and our children (after I had told him in no uncertain terms I was never going back to him). I told him if he were to keep bringing up me being with him in the future in any way, I would block him (regardless of his stuff). He agreed at the time.\n\nAlso other minor note, we both just graduated, I broke up with him mid-semester. He later told me he felt that if he was able to get good grades this semester (he was usually borderline failing some of his classes) it would prove he could do the hard work to change because he had thought he couldn\u2019t get good grades. And so would have the right in his own mind to try pursuing me on the premise that he would change and I could wait however long I wanted to marry him (relationship right away though). He got good grades. I told him, still no. A couple days ago he got notification he was on the dean\u2019s honor roll, following conversation ensued (we are bilingual, I tried to translate the non-English parts as faithfully as possible):\n\nLast night:\nEx: I never thought I would get this! Only you ever believed I could! I am so grateful to you, you are the best woman I ever met!\n\nEx: [my name], I think perhaps I can tell you how I feel, I still want to be with you forever, that is my dream! I am sorry to tell you this, maybe it will make you uncomfortable, but I won\u2019t force you to do anything....\n\nEx: There are other things I want to tell you, respond when you see this, cute little [my name]~\n\nMe: congratulations, of course I always believed you could do it. However, I believe I said before that if you kept mentioning being with me again that I would need to block you? You told me before that you already decided you wouldn\u2019t marry anyone besides me [he was telling me he had come to terms with everything and he wouldn\u2019t mind no matter who I married], and so I already could guess you probably thought this way, otherwise why would you add \u201cbesides me\u201d? Remember I told you there is no way I am going back to you, and told you not to mention it again, now you bringing it up again is very disrespectful of me. And afterwards you apologized and said you knew it might make me uncomfortable? It feels like before you said that you were buttering me up, making it uncomfortable for me to call you out? [probably went too far here? I was a bit upset at the time...] I\u2019m sorry but I cannot accept this.\n\nEx: you still haven\u2019t slept.... I wasn\u2019t making it uncomfortable for you to call me out. If I do something wrong you should call me out. Maybe it\u2019s because of you can\u2019t see tone of voice through text......why would I butter you up? How could you think such a thing \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 I just think you believing in me probably isn\u2019t fake, unless you were just saying it, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very possible. This counts as buttering you up....what good does it do me to butter you up? Make you feel good about me? What would my motive be? \n\nEx: I am very touched by the time you spent with me, and so these are feelings from my heart. I don\u2019t know how you turned it into buttering you up and making it uncomfortable for you to call me out. I don\u2019t know why, but every time I talk to you it makes me feel degraded. Makes me hurt myself. I used to be like that but I\u2019m not anymore. This isn\u2019t healthy, I want to share positive things with you, good things. Life is so short. Nobody is perfect, I\u2019m no exception, but my starting point is that I am grateful to you, I know you would hate to be with me forever, I know you don\u2019t want to at all. That\u2019s ok, but I\u2019m not trying to do anything or say anything to cause us to be together forever, it\u2019s impossible anyways, so I didn\u2019t even consider it. You did a lot of things too that hurt me when we were together, you aren\u2019t perfect either, but I don\u2019t bring them up every time we talk, use these things to analyze your every word, what\u2019s the point, if there\u2019s only hate and no love, no relationship will last, not just with me but with anyone......\n\nI had a grateful heart, at the time I was moved and missed you....but you turned it into something evil....\n\nI just want to say, even if you don\u2019t want it, I still have the right to have a dream......I will never mention it again, just hide it in my heart, that was the mistake I made this time, because I was so moved\n\nThis morning:\n\nMe: Thank you for not bringing it up again. Of course you have the right to dream.....I wasn\u2019t saying that me believing in you was buttering me up, but more of the \u201cyou are the best woman I have ever met.\u201d It is true that I always believed you could do it.\n\nEx: that counts as buttering you up? If you got a first place medal in a race, and we\u2019re going to have an acceptance speech,  and you were moved and thanked your mother and father and said they are the best, should your parents say you are buttering them up? \ud83e\udd14 I\u2019m not sure about the motive of that, but it seems toxic. Not you the person but the words from the person\n\n[insert screenshot from Pinterest \u201c8 Toxic People You Should Just Get Rid Of\u201d]\n\nMe: Oh really? I was talking about in context where you say that, and then mention being together forever  when I told you not to?\n\nEx: last night I browsed Pinterest because I couldn\u2019t sleep cause the words so hurting and the attitude so negative I didn\u2019t mention that today\n\nMe: Ignoring people\u2019s boundaries is also toxic?\n\nEx: I said that was my mistake I won\u2019t mention it, not the same as ignoring \n\nI never dreamed of having that, Dean\u2019s honor roll with 15 credit hours\n\nIgnoring your boundaries does no good for me, will cause you hate me why I intentionally do that\n\nMe: yes kinda. I told you I have a boundary, and you continue to overstep it. It was important enough to me that I said we should block each other if it is a problem. Then why did you do that if it is obviously overstepping a boundary I set with you earlier?\n\nEx: from the chat I didn\u2019t mean to, I stated it was my dream and I let it go. I didn\u2019t force. I won\u2019t mention that forever.\n\nMe: But I believe the boundary wasn\u2019t to force to begin with, but rather just bringing it up.\n\nEx. Ugh. I don\u2019t know why every time we chat, not just this time, it always makes me unhappy. Maybe I felt wrong.\n\nMe: I guess what I\u2019m saying is, it feels like you overstepped a boundary and then downplay it like it\u2019s not important, perhaps I am feeling wrong?\n\nEx: you make me feel like I\u2019m an evil person, ignore my messages and everything \n\nMe: you know, if you had not mentioned being together earlier, I would have simply wholeheartedly congratulated you?\n\nEx: really hurts \n\nNo\n\nMe: You overstepped the boundary and I am supposed to ignore it because you have good news?\n\nEx: like last several times, even if I don\u2019t mention things like that, I\u2019m trying to be friendly and nice, but every time I felt the wrath towards me. I want to share something really positive.\n\nMe: what\u2019s wrong with last time? [a civil discussion where he shared that he was fine with me marrying anyone and he wished me happiness, I wished him happiness in return]\n\nEx: what do you mean?\n\nMe: and you did! And then overstepped my boundary! And I can\u2019t ignore that!\n\nYou said every time the last times. What was wrong with last time?\n\nEx: that was me, I shouldn\u2019t be so emotional \n\nMe: like I said, I wanted to just say that I was proud of you and you did a good job\n\nEx: caused I had an hones roll [sic]\n\nMe: if you had left it at that and not overstepped the boundary I set\n\nEx: that was all the problem, I shouldn\u2019t have\n\nMe: then I would have done that\n\nEx: probably I shouldn\u2019t tell you that\n\nMe: being emotional and happy doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok to overstep \n\nEx: all I did was to thank you, and at that time I just want to express that I love you, and my dream is trying to get you back. Like that honor roll things\n\nMe: all? No, you did not just thank me! You said it was your dream to be with me forever! I had already told you not to talk about or mention that sort of thing!\n\nEx: maybe the directions shift a little to make you felt I intentionally to ignore your boundaries \n\nMe: if there was not that boundary, perhaps it would not be that bad, but I feel like you are still not making my boundaries important \n\nEx: I won\u2019t mention that again. I will never mention that again. Are you happy now?\n\nMe: ok, that you in advance for respecting my boundaries.\n\n[change topic, he asks to see my cat, I congratulate him on honor roll]\n\nEx: don\u2019t mention it. I don\u2019t want to hear anything about honor roll. Let\u2019s just forget about it. The pain it brings more than happiness\n\nI\u2019m crying right now, cause I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s just forget about it forever.\n\n[sends crying selfie]\n\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTL;DR: ex got upset after I brought up boundary.

In my last post on here I talked about how my dad slammed into a wall, leaving a big hole in the wall, but i want to talk about my childhood and what he has done to me in my childhood. \n\nThere plenty of things I can talk about but I will just start off with what I can mainly remember, when I was younger, about 5 years up until 8 or 9 my dad would always try to scare me and sometimes my mom would join in, now, i have a sister and they would never try to scare her, only me, almost all the time it would be after I watch a scary movie or just at random. They thought this was funny but I never thought it was, then them scaring me eventually lead to me being REALLY scared of the dark and have me fear that I could die at any moment at night. I eventually got over this at around 10 or 11 years.\n\nThe next thing is my dad when it comes to discipline when I was younger, let's say 7 my dad would have a tool he called a paddle and he would use the paddle to hit me whenever I did something wrong, usually on the butt, now this paddle was made of real wood and he hand crafted it, it was basically a really thick wooden paddle with holes in the center I guess for less resistance? But he would use that on me like as I said for discipline, but one day I really faintly remember this, he hit me in the wrist with it, it was either the paddle or his hand and it broke a vein in my wrist. He did apologize for it and he told me that when I go to school and people ask about it I say that I fell down a hill. \n\n\nNow my final thing I'm going to talk about is when my dad, again was using the paddle, I remember this quite well. He was using the paddle on me because I hit my sister. When he was trying to hit me with it I kept on resisting and ran away from him in the house, eventually a hid in a blanket on my couch and my dad started going ham with the paddle, he didnt care where he hit he just kept on hitting me on the legs, eventually he hit me on the knee hard and the paddle split and broke, it left a bruise on me and it hurt for a few weeks.\n\nIs this abuse? I really need to know.\n\nAlso recently ever since December of 2018 he's been calm but I still dont trust he will ever be completely calm, there are many other little things that he has done to me through out my life but these are the things I mainly want to highlight", "subreddit": "abuse"}

So I went back to NC and was making good progress.\n\nA week ago I woke up to a text from her asking how I was and she sent a picture of herself. We talked a little (stupid I know), and then I asked her how her kids were and was ignored. The next morning I tried to call which of course wasn't answered. But she texted me later saying she was busy and continued to update me on her life. This went on for 3 days. If I asked to speak on the phone or to meet for a coffee she was suddenly busy but then would continue to text me.\n\nI left it at that and started to ignore her, so she found reasons to message me. \"Hey I need a favour....\", \"Sorry to bug you but....\" was how each morning started. So I called her out and asked if we were meeting up or what. She said she was too busy but she promises we will keep in touch. I told her no, that I need to move on and would rather not keep in touch.\n\nBoy, did that get a response. About a 20 paragraph text response! She said she didnt understand why I was upset because  we were never even dating and she made that clear from the start. Then her tune changed and basically put all blame on me. Saying my house was too dirty, she didnt like my dog, I pushed and pressured her into things. I'll admit my house wasnt perfect and she helped me clean it up once and then I maintained/improved on it, while we were dating she was obsessed with my dogs as were her kids, and I didnt push her into anything. She asked if I wanted to go on a trip and I said sure, but apparently I took that place away from her because she felt pressured to go with me since I wanted to go. She was also trying to book a second trip  with me and her kids before the discard but ok? lol\n\nShe then told me my toothbrush wasn't new enough (? lol) and that this all drove her away to not want to date me anymore (but she had first said we werent dating lol).\n\nFinally I asked her to come get her stuff which she replied that she would when she felt like it, and that she understood my anger but I had no right to be angry towards her because she only treated me with respect and honesty.\n\nFinally I had it, called her out on all her contradictory responses and told her I'd get someone to drop her stuff off and this was the last text Id ever send to her and to not contact me again. She said I was being nasty but if that made me feel any better then fine. And that was that.\n\nPeople, just stay no contact with these emotional leeches. I guess she needed to contact me for supply, or she was bored or she wanted to get me to lose it on her and make me the bad guy. Thankfully I made sure each and every message was respectful but to the point. I cannot stand how these people operate and conduct themselves, and wouldnt wish anyone ever has to have a relationship with them in any way.\n\nThis is just more of a rant / journal and way for me to get it all out, but I hope for anyone in a similar situation you can take from it that they dont change, they dont take responsibility, they think theyre perfect and there is no point playing their game because they truly do not care about anyone but themselves and will just fuck with you for the fun of it.\n\nI have an appointment this week with a therapist and I absolutely cant wait to start to truly recover from this person who has messed with me off and on for almost 2 years", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She had issues, but was getting help. We communicated well, bonded well, had amazing chemistry, she treated my kids well, and we could rely on each other to lift either of us out of a bad mood. I saw a couple very small red flags that she owned up to and explained as things she picked up from her narcissistic mom, but without her mom in her life much, I thought she'd be able to get past those. She was perfect in my eyes and we were talking about getting married later this year.\nBut then her drinking and drug issues got worse. She stole my kids ADHD meds, which were in a lock box that she cracked the code on. I called her out on it and all hell broke loose. She blamed me for not buying a lock box she couldn't crack. She harassed me for 3 days on her adderall/alcohol binge, not letting me sleep because she couldn't. She started a physical fight with me but I overpowered her, only acting with enough force to defend myself, not injuring her in any way.\n\nShe ran off and flagged down a cop car and apparently told her that I tried to kill her, choked her until she passed out, none of which were true, she didn't even have any marks, but they had to book me anyhow on a felony DV charge. I had bruises and scratches all over me so they booked her too but only on a misdemeanor. \n\nI'm still waiting to go to court. I'm 90% sure the judge will see through her lies and either drop or reduce my charges. But all this has destroyed my life in the meantime. We lost our residence and my children are temporally placed with their dads. I had to move into my grandpa's cluttered, dusty basement full of old mouse droppings. I'm having trouble finding a decent paying job that wouldn't worsen my disabilities (primarily bad back, bad foot, and fibromyalgia). And I keep hearing from mutual friends all kinds of awful lies about me. Luckily most of them are smart enough to see through that and don't believe a word she says.\n\nYet my story is not unusual. There are stories of abuse like this that's gone on for years. People's lives have ended because of this stuff. Children have been hurt.

He also told me he hopes I'm doing well, how I deserve to have a good life and hopes to hear from me... I'm not responding.\n\nSo how do I feel about his life being like that now? Genuinely happy for him, Ive always wished him success and happiness, he's taking steps to improve and I'm glad for him. All I want really is nothing to do with his life.\n\nSo I asked myself, it's nearly been 2 years, I haven't spoken to him in all this time, why has he contacted me? What does he want from me? What are his motives?\n\nI know my answer, I don't care.\n\nEver since learning about separation of tasks (I will go into detail if anyone wants to learn more), I realise it isn't my job to work these answers out. I don't need to know his motives, why he wants to talk to me, none of it.\n\nIt's a huge weight off my shoulders, I'm still upset but I'm handling this well.\n\nThank you for reading", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u2019m talking about emotional dependency, which to healthy people is completely normal. Narcissists take this and use it against you. \n\nIf you are the type of person who is honest, allows yourself to be emotionally vulnerable, and likes to connect with people, you will have a huge target on your back. Why? Because any emotional vulnerability that you show is seen as an \u201cin\u201d when it comes to a narcissist. Anything you want, need, or are looking for from another person is viewed as a way in. Into your mind and heart, so they can mess with you. \n\nPeople who are nice are prime targets because nice people are energetically open. They like people and relate to them in a trusting manner. They don\u2019t think to be suspicious, so they don\u2019t put their guard up. A narcissist sees this as a free meal ticket. You\u2019re letting them in at no cost. \n\nIt\u2019s nothing more than a game to these creatures. A person who is open, trusting, and shows their emotional reactions is seen as a toy that the narcissist feels entitled to play with. So, normal human interconnectedness is seen as a weakness to them, and they will attack you for it.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

What if the triangulation was about getting my attention? What if he was really too polite to tell me in so many words that i've become a fat repulsive slob, so instead a few gentle hints about losing weight, and refusing physical intimacy, were given, which I mistook for devaluation? Should I have given him the 3 days \"space\" he wanted when I was brain-injured, instead of calling it silent treatment/discard and demanding that he deal with me when i was sick, calling his refusal a dumpable offence? Serious accidents can cloud one's judgement after all. Have I jumped to the conclusion that he's a narcissist just because he couldn't tolerate one situation in which my needs were the appropriate priority? Or does his inability to see anything wrong with his behaviour in that situation indicate narcissism as strongly as I believed at the time?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I just put my two weeks in at the job I work, which is his family's business. I cannot work there anymore, as he shows up and makes it clear his only motive is to hurt me. Let's see, where did I leave off last? oh yeah thats right, he was trying to get with his brother's ex girlfriend after hoovering me back in with those fake promises and fake declarations of love. This was the beginning of this month (June.) He's already on girl number 3, in a matter of weeks. Priceless..\n\n I have since ran for my life from him. I was done. He has since texted me from different phone numbers and made a fake Instagram and Twitter to harass me. His texts:\n\n\"I wouldn't be able to trust anyone either after all things I did to you, so I understand.\"\n\nand when I did not reply,\n\n\"Fuck you.\"\n\nTwo days later:\n\n\"I need my wake board back.\"\n\nThursday:\n\n\"-sends picture of his mothers Find My Friends iPhone location, as she is in Yellowstone, a place we would visit and loved.-\"\n\nI did not reply. \n\nFriday: He now magically has a new girlfriend! Wow, shocking! This is where it gets creepy. On Friday, I went to the beach with some friends. I kept getting notifcations on my phone saying \"@\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ has liked your tweet.\" over and over and over. He went onto my twitter and liked every single tweet I have ever posted. He did this with a fake twitter account. He gave himself away because my friends took a group snapchat of us at the beach, posted it on his story, and he immediately messaged my friend and said \"Wow you all look like you are having fun.\" busted....\n\nMy twitter has always been private. It is now magically public, which is leading me to believe he logged into my account. A flying monkey today sent me a photo he posted with the new supply. Lovely. I just blocked and laughed. Unbelievable.\n\nMy question is, if this stalking keeps up, which i am sure it will, do I take action with the police?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}
