I respect myself, I have good self-esteem, and I know that I am enough for myself. A year ago I wouldn't even dare to think those things, let alone say them out loud to myself. I am on a path towards becoming whole, developing my sense of self, and all in all I think I'm headed for great things. Of course not everything is perfect, but I understand it all now. \nAll I needed to do was connect the dots and it was over. Once I started researching narcissistic abuse, it all clicked, and I realized that I was never in a relationship with him but merely a pawn in his sick game. He lied to my face with such ease, convinced me time and time again that I was crazy, and even continued to swear he never cheated on me after he gave me an STD. \nI am done with him forever. He's trash. He's attempted hoovering multiple times and gave up once I told him to stop asking for head because it was never going to happen again. The fact he had the audacity to ask that after giving me an STD that has caused so much pain and anxiety for me... that on it's own proves he has no sense of morality or being a decent human being. \n\nI honestly can't think of a way he could get me back. Nothing he can say will ever make me forgive him, because I know it's all lies. I feel so strong in this and I know people will probably discourage this but... \nI want to fuck with his head the way he did with me. I am not a narcissist by any means, I am a loving, compassionate, and empathetic person who tries to see the best in people. That's probably why I became a victim to him. \nI feel like I could pretend to be the insecure, self-loathing, codependent little girl I was when he found me, and I feel like he'd believe it. \nGetting him into my hands would be easy, but I'm lost about what to do after that. Probably because I'm not a psychopathic piece of shit who regularly contemplates how to use and abuse people. \n\nHis situation is bad and it brings me great pleasure to know that this sad, pathetic fuck is still homeless, still smelling like urine, still friendless, and still sitting alone in his car in a sad, empty parking lot. But I just want to hurt him so badly. \nJust\nwouldn't it be hilarious if he thought I was back at his service, and he begged me for an unreasonably unfair \"favor\" like he so often did before. Tried every technique and concocted one sob story after another to gain my pity, only for me to say \"sike! tough luck fuckface. and by the way, I DID fuck the guy you always accused of me cheating on you with.\" \nIt would bring me so much joy to see him struggling yet again, begging me to empty my bank account to fix another one of his mistakes, only to have him feel as alone and uncared for as I did for the entire year he had me at his beck and call. \n\nAm I a bad person for thinking this? I don't think I am. I don't feel this towards anyone else -- just him, because he deserves only the worst. I don't believe in god or karma. I hate having to hope that he's suffering. I want to know that he is and I want to revel in that. I want to soak up his anguish and laugh at it. Perhaps it is evil, to an extent, but it's a justified evil. \n\nThis is mostly just a sick fantasy. I really don't have the time or energy to develop an entire act just to degrade him. In all truth, the game plan as of right now is just to get back the money he owes me (I'm actually fairly certain I am going to get it back. He paid me back for almost everything else, mostly because I won't let him forget about it.) Once I get my money, I miiiiight send a final text about how I did end up sleeping with the guy he was jealous of all along, just because I find it hilarious. I'm also hoping it triggers enough anger in him that he'll try to hurt me back and will finally admit to cheating, though I doubt it. \nI probably sound crazy tbh. But after a year of having my reality completely distorted, experiencing a living hell, and hearing every day about all the things that make me a repulsive, unlovable human being... can you blame me? \n\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: I know it's been awhile but I read every single comment and the advice you all have given me has helped tremendously. I realized that it isn't like me to want to hurt someone like that. I spent a few days trying to think up the absolute worst things I could ever say to him to try and dig to the core of his vulnerabilities and say something that would really burn his ego. As a few commenters pointed out, he most likely wouldn't care, would only get amusement out of it, and would just use it to hurt me even worse. I do feel ashamed, because even if I pretended that it might hurt him... that there was something I could say to make him feel pain, I would feel bad. \nThere's a reason I don't blurt out things during arguments that I know could deeply hurt other people and target their insecurities. Because as mad as I might get at someone, I don't want to make them feel \"less than\" as a person or cripple their self-esteem in some way. I don't want to do that to someone else, because I know how easily it can all fall apart after that. The thing is, even if I could hurt him, he is not capable of the self-reflection and shamefulness it takes to know what he did was wrong and improve it. He will never have that self-insight, and it isn't entirely his fault that he doesn't have that. \nSo thanks to all the replies, I'm going to work on replying to each one individually, but if I don't just know that the feedback was greatly appreciated and I feel more much stable now. &lt;3", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

This is a throw away, obviously. \n\nTrigger warning...\n\nSo, in college I dated a girl, and she was amazing, and we're still friends, but she was there first person I told about my dad. I didn't really think it was abuse at the time, but I know better now thanks to her. She actually directed me here, to this forum a couple months ago. \n\nSorry, I have a lot of thoughts going on right now. \n\nMy dad is really religious, he used to be a part time pastor. I had a really religious upbringing. I mean, was never spanked, or beaten by him, my brother was not so lucky. My dad always took us to church, and made us go to youth group constantly. My brother was not into religion, and that's why he always got beaten. I got spanked twice, but it literally altered my life, and it took a long time to realize it was actually abuse, and not just for my betterment.\n\nWell, one night my dad heard me in my room. I think I was 12, I remembered it was 6th grade. My dad heard me in my room late one night. It was really late, like 1 or 2 in the morning. I realize now, it's totally normal, and not at all wrong for someone that age to experiment with their body. He walked into my room to yell at me that my TV was on, and I was on the bed, half exposed, masturbating. \n\nIt was so embarrassing, and he just starts yelling at me. Telling me how sinful what I was doing was. I remember I tried to pull my underwear back up, and he dragged me by my arm out of bed, I got rug burn on my hip and thigh as he dragged me to the bathroom. The entire time yelling at me, I know at that point I was crying. He never hit me before, but I got really scared that he would spank me like he spanked my brother. \n\nHe put over the edge of the bathtub, and just started spanking me, I know I was crying hard, and even screamed for my mom, but she didn't come out of her room. She said she didn't hear me when I confronted her about it last year. \n\nHe kept telling me how I was going to hell, and how dirty it was, and started quoting scripture, and telling me Jesus saw my filth. I mean, he was strict, but never like this. He picked me from the bathtub, took my underwear completely off, and put me by the sink. He kept telling me how dirty it was, and I was dirty, and my hands were dirty. There was a cuticle brush by the sink, and he started scrubbing my hands. Hard. It started to hurt. I kept apologizing, but he didn't listen. Then he took the cuticle brush to my genitals, and scrubbed. \n\nThe next morning my brother asked if I was okay. He told me dad did that to him too a couple times. I didn't tell anyone about it. I thought I was going to hell, and God was hurt by my actions. \n\nI believed that for a couple years. I hurt God, and my dad was right, and what I was doing was filthy. I didn't touch myself again for at least a year. \n\nAfter about a month my dad didn't mention it again, and I tried to forget the shame. \n\nA couple years later, I started touching myself again. There was always a level of shame to it after that. He had me go to more youth meetings, and things resumed their normal routine. I thought I was keeping it a secret. \n\nThis time my mom caught me. It was again late at night, and she came into my room to turn off my TV. She closed the door right away, and I felt all the shame like before. I remember being still in my bed, and I just started crying. \n\nLike who the fuck, would have instilled that level of shame into their child. I'm not even 25. It's not like this happened years ago. \n\nI don't know how long it was, but I was lying there crying, and my dad burst into my room. I started apologizing immediately. He was furious. He had a belt in his hand. He made me get out of bed, and kneel down, and he made me pray while hitting me with the belt. After I cried, and prayed, and cried, he grabbed me by the arm, and forced me into the bathroom. \n\nSorry, I'm like, crying while writing this.  I just don't understand, why...\n\nHe told me about being dirty and he scrubbed my hands, and my genitals, and then he made me face him, and he opened the medicine cabinet and got some arthritis cream out, and rubbed it on me. It hurt so badly. I was sobbing, and he pulled up my underwear, and lead me back to my room. He told me that should keep me from touching myself again. \n\nI didn't sleep the rest of night. Between the physical pain, and feeling like I one again let God down, I couldn't sleep. I think I cried until I got up for school in the morning. At breakfast, no one even spoke to me. My brother was already away at college, so it was just my parents and I at the table. \n\nMy genitals still hurt, but I made it through the day. I stated in my room all day. I had dinner early, so I wouldn't have to be around my parents. \n\nIt was getting late, and I took a shower, and as I was getting out of the bathroom my dad pushed me back into it. He said he was going to remind me not to touch myself again. He told me to pull down my sweatpants, and I didn't, so he pulled the belt out of his pants and got me several times. I pulled down my pants, and he put the cream on my genitals again. It burned, and skin was so raw. \n\nHe did this every night, for a month. A whole fucking month, he did that to me every night. He would sometimes threaten me with it, but after that month he stopped. I didn't touch myself again. In fact, it's still hard to touch myself.\n\nWhen I dated this girl in college, she wanted to have sex, and I wanted to be cool, and I tried, but when we both started to undress, I just started crying, and I couldn't stop. She kept asking what was wrong, and we didn't talk for a bit after. It was a couple days before she texted me to come to her apartment. \n\nI told her about how God wouldn't want us to have sex, and how any pleasures before marriage were a sin, and I just kept crying. We had a really long talk that night, all night, I finally told her why the thought of sex before marriage made me cry. I told her about my dad, and she just hugged me, and told me about how she survived abuse. \n\nAt first I didn't see how the two were related. I viewed it as my sin. Something horrible I did. She was the one who told me that what my father did was wrong. And unfortunately, it took a lot of convincing. I just couldn't believe what my dad did was abuse, and I didn't think my parents would hurt me, and what they did, they did for me.\n\nIt honestly took about two years before I could even start touching myself again. It was like every time I tried, it was like the burning from being scrubbed with the cuticle brush and the arthritis cream. We ended up dating a while, but I actually ended it because she was ready for a relationship, and I was still getting used to myself, sexually, and I thought she deserved more than I could give her, both emotionally and sexually.\n\nAbout a year ago I asked my brother about it. The beatings, and I told him about the scrub brush, and he said that, yeah that was what dad did. Dad caught him a couple times when he was younger, and that was why dad was always more aggressive with him. When I told him about the scrubbing, he said that he remembered, and I told him about the cream, and he said dad never did it multiple days in a row to him. My brother has no relationship with my parents. When we talked, he cried, and said he felt bad leaving me there when he went away to college, and I told him it wasn't his fault. He had been in there for a couple years after college, and it helped. \n\nThat's one of the reasons I wanted to write this down. I have my first therapy appointment later today. It's like 2am, and I can't sleep, and my thoughts are all over. \n\nLast week, I went to my parent's house, to confront them. My mom was there, but my dad want home yet. I just directly asked her why. Why did dad do those things... Her response was... \"I just thought he spanked you a bit.\" I just couldn't believe it. She went on about how since it was a sin to touch yourself, she didn't really see a problem with a small beating, but she never would have let it go on had she known. I mean, she had to have known, right? I still can't believe she didn't know. \n\nMy dad got there, and at this point, I'm pissed, and confused, and angry, and as he walked in the door, I started berating him. I told him how dare he make someone hate their own body so much, and there is nothing wrong with touching yourself. \n\nI still believe in God, but I do not think good would want us to be punished for jacking off! That thought is ridiculous to me. \n\nMy dad's response was almost as heinous as mom's. \"Well at least I kept you from sinning.\" \n\nI just left. I left their house. My mom had called a couple times, but I just can't talk to her right now. I called my brother, and he said that I should forgive them, but I should not communicate with them either. I get what he's saying, but there is so much I want to say to my dad. \n\nI'm still crying, but at least I feel somewhat different after writing it all down. \n\nIt's just hard to think about taking someone you love, and hurting them like that, and saying it was good for you, and it kept you from misbehaving. \n\nThis was abuse, right? \n\nOne thing that I still find difficult, even after all these years, is I still have sympathy for him. Like, well, he tried to make sure I would get into heaven, so I'm sure he didn't mean to give me years of trauma to love out. Is that normal? \n\nI'm sorry if it's all over the place, but thanks for letting me write it. \n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I also know that since this is my first relationship, I have looked up to him as I would a parent on occasion (as a result of needing to have someone to anchor myself with as a replacement of my mom) hence, the emotional need to seek validation from him from time to time. \n\nHe has apologised since and I have been able to communicate that his words have hurt me immensely and will take me time to possibly heal from it. If not, then maybe this isnt meant to be for me, and thats ok. \n\nHowever, in certain cases now, his ideologies around politics and feminism are coming in the way of my ability to connect with him. While he approaches things with reason, I dont agree with some of his view points. Now, I dont have a healthy template for relationships hence, posting here, how does one balance ideologies in a generally decent relationship?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

It's also really hard to put it in words. Crying expresses the pain in the best way. I'm not exaggerating, though.\n\nMy childhood was pretty much perfect. My parents loved me, cared for me. But when the puberty hit in, it all started to change. Important thing to mention - I wasn't an awful teenager. I've never arrived home late (without telling them), I've never been drunk, nor did I take drugs or steal something. They had literally nothing to complain about, but they *did* complain.\n\nBoth of my parents grew up in a toxic environment. My father's dad had died when he was just a little boy and my mom had suffered from a very harsh abuse from her own mother, so I know where all of this came from. My dad used to beat me for everything. I left a sock on the ground, he hit me. I forgot to close the door, he hit me. And when we had an argument, beating was his answer to everything. I could never express my own opinion, I was never allowed to speak up. Everything they said was sacred and when I tried to defend myself, I got beaten up. \n\nWhen my grandmother was still alive (most ironically - my mother's mom, the abusive one), she was the only one I could talk to. It sounds like a bullshit now, I know, but as she got older and wiser, she had realized her mistakes and felt very sorry for what she did to my mom. Their relationship got much better as the years passed by, but it was never completely fine. \n\nNow I'm 18 and I suffer from BPD and some other post-traumatic syndromes. When someone raises their hand towards me, I twitch. I don't trust people, I'm extremely anxious and I hate my parents. I really do. Although there were many good things about them, I could never forget that... puberty episode when they psychically destroyed me. I still live with my parents and they still abuse me. It's just psychical now, but it hurts even more. They deny everything, they blame me for everything, when I'm trying to make things work, they ignore me and even force me to apologize for the things they hurt me with. Soon, I'll be off to university in a different town. Sadly, finally escaping my parents is the main reason I want to go there. Not education. So... wish me luck in the entrance exams.\n\nI just wanted to let you know that if you're going through something similar, you're not alone. There are thousands of kids all over the globe crying in their rooms right now because their parents aren't a good role models for them. Including me.

The door will always be open...", "author": "Matty_Bo_Batty", "self_text": "This is going to be a very long post, so please bear with me to the end. This is my account of what has happened and the way I interpret everything having to do with my relationship, or past relationship.\n\n\nWARNING: Some descriptions and experiences below are explicit and NSFW. Proceed with caution. TLDR at the bottom.\n\n\nBack in 2015 I met and immediately fell in love with a girl. She was a college student, and she would come to hangout and drink in the bar I worked at. We became close, and she eventually had to make a choice between me and another guy she was interested in, but had known for longer. The sparks flew when we first were dating, and everything seemed so perfect. Yes, it was love at first sight for me. Cheesy, but I know even now that it was true.\n\n\nAt the very beginning, we disclosed so many deep and personal aspects of ourselves. This was incredibly difficult for her, as she distrusts most people and has difficulty opening up to them. I, on the other hand, have always been an open book. Anyway, I confessed so many things about my life. That I had been battling depression since I was a teenager, and even attempted suicide after finding out that a former girlfriend was cheating on me. I also included at the start, though it was nerve-racking, my interests in fetishism. Being that I have almost no limitations whatsoever, and that my personal favorites include but are not limited to watersports, ABDL, and even scat, I felt that it was necessary to include before entering a relationship. Aside from that, I told her plenty of other important details. Like my father having passed away due to cancer earlier that year, past relationship issues and trauma, fears and phobias, etc. Nothing was off limits, and I made sure to let her know who I really was deep down. No secrets.\u00a0\n\n\nLikewise, she confessed in her own way. She is a writer, an English major, and preferred to put her thoughts out on paper. So, she wrote me what felt like a novel, and I read and interpreted it. She went into detail about past trauma from abusive relationships, as well as having been cheated on, and cheating on someone. Going so far to admit that she could even cheat on me. She went on to elaborate, describing in detail her experience with a former significant other who sexually violated her. Which, later, would become an even more relevant topic for the two of us. Elaboration on her family issues, attempts at suicide, self-harm, experiences with toxicity, bisexual orientation, trust issues, genetic disorders, and more followed throughout the letter, and through conversation. Nothing she ever said pushed me away, or scared me. I was always confident that as long as she loved me, I would happily be by her side.\u00a0\n\n\nThe relationship she had with this other man became a problem for both of us. She couldn't decide at first who she wanted to be with. Her decision process took most of the summer, and was met with waves of emotions and passion from both parties crashing against her. One particular evening, after she had invited me over while he was visiting, I noticed a condom wrapper in the trash. I stormed out, nearly broke my hand hitting a tree, and went for a walk. Eventually, I came back, and we got into a heated discussion. After all, she had told me that she was thinking of telling him that she was done, and was going to choose me. I have a history of anger management issues, but I would never hurt someone I love...apparently only myself, when I hit inanimate objects. That afternoon, we came to a reasonable agreement, that we both loved each other, and that she would tell him. I apologized for the way I reacted, but also let her know how much it hurt to find that after having been told that I had her heart. After long late-night discussions, intimate evenings, and a heavily drawn out process of elimination, she told him, and she took hold of my heart. Relief washed over both of us, and the passion and emotion we had expressed behind closed lips could finally see daylight. Though, we never officially declared our relationship until Halloween of 2016. We wanted our anniversary to match with the night we first met.\n\n\nFast forward a little, and we had been together for approximately three months, officially. Early on, she told me she was unsure of whether or not she could involve herself in my kinks. Though, she understood the importance of them, she didn't share those interests. By this time, she expressed that she actually couldn't see herself partaking in any of them. Rather, it felt as though she had gotten my hopes up, and then decided to give up before ever trying. This impacted me very negatively, as sexual compatibility and fulfillment is also very crucial to a healthy relationship. For someone who is so involved in fetishism, it can be one of the most defining details. We discussed this for some time, but it always seemed to get worse. This caused a reaction from me, and led me to become passive aggressive and doubtful in the future of our relationship. Though, I loved her and never doubted that for a moment, I still had my own needs of which to be aware.\n\n\nJanuary 25th of 2017, I made a mistake that continues to haunt me to this day. Using an alternate Facebook account I set up for sharing with like-minded fetishists on a platonic level, I made a post. I stated that I had no interest in \"vanilla sex\", and that I wanted something more kinky in my life. Which, wasn't entirely true, as this girl I was with was literally the first person able to get me to achieve a climax. I always enjoyed the sex, regardless of whether it involved my kinks or not. Anyway, I went much further. I asked aloud to those I had befriended if anyone was like me and craved my fetishes as much as I did. Asking if any women wanted to do something with me that was far from \"vanilla\". When I did this, I never sought a response. All I ever wanted was validation that I could leave if I wanted to, and that I wasn't stuck. I didn't want to give my heart to someone for years, and be stuck in a position with children, marriage, or other such commitments, while not being satisfied. That would not be fair for either of us. No one ever replied, and I never followed up with any action. Even after the posting, I stayed with her because I wanted to work it out and be there with her always. My love was never brought into question. In time, we would eventually ease into my kinks, and some even became a semi-regular occurrence. Though, she never could commit to scat, and informed me even after attempting to take an enema for me that she wouldn't be able to do that for me. The rest seemed to be okay, but she never really enjoyed any of it. Understandably so, but at least she was willing to meet me halfway. I never ceased in my desires to further our experimentation, and would occasionally state that \"it would be nice if you would\" or \"if you ever surprised me with ____, it would make me so very happy\".\n\n\nUnbeknownst to me, this became an internal struggle for her. She wasn't ever interested in my kinks. Though, she had a few of her own, she only ever admitted to a couple. Again, alluding to her distrusting nature, and inability to open up. As time went by, she would continue to react to my comments or mentions of kink with disgust and minor derogatory gestures. Often times, she required alcohol to free up her inhibitions, and allow herself to partake in my interests during sex. I recognized this as a potentially harmful means to handling it, but she insisted, and I wanted to support her decisions. Later, I will go further into the topic of her self-medication. We were relatively open about our sex life, and she expressed that she supported me and my interests. That she wanted to give me what she felt she could. However, later I would find out that she called me a \"weirdo\", and considered my kinks and personal interests to be gross. Followed up with plenty of other unfavorable descriptors.\n\n\nNow, onto the self-medication aforementioned. Being a bartender in this small college town, she would very often come see me at work. We would drink together, and spent many nights and moments involving alcohol in each other's company. After she had chosen me over the other guy, she tried to maintain a friendship. He became inconsolably and erratically emotional. His friends, who were also her best friends, decided to take his side and defend him. They abandoned her, and she never forgave them. As it turned out, the guy was taking a mental disorder to try to earn her back and make her feel guilty. So, due to all of this and her pre-existing depression, she began to drink frequently. And in very copious amounts. I would often bring her home drunk, and put her to bed. Though, we also used the lack on inhibitions brought on by her inebriation to open up and experiment in bed. We agreed beforehand that this was consensual, and she preferred to be a little drunk before engaging in any of my kinks. As such, we would sometimes have sex while she was intoxicated. But, this became a serious problem. I recognized that it was feeding into her depression, and that she often would become relatively toxic and/or extremely emotionally unstable. As much as I tried to remedy the situation, it only got worse. To the point where she eventually dumped all of her depression on me, and expected me to handle it for her.\n\n\nTime continued on, and our relationship with it. We were so incredibly happy with each other, and even moved in together. We adopted a tiny kitten I saved one fateful night. Everything became shared, and our love grew substantially. Though we, like any other couple, had our own issues of varying severity, we were an amazing pair. Sure, our issues obviously would become increasingly worse as time went on. However, I was always open and very direct, and thus I focused on handling situations as they arose. The above mentioned self-medication, depression, and toxicity didn't become a real issue until after we moved in together.\n\n\nNever did my love for her waver, nor did my support. Through everything, I always was there and willing to help or pick her up when she fell. Though, I must admit, my own issues became a problem as well. Her depression seemed to fuel my own, and had an increasingly negative effect on my mind. My anger issues also became worse, as I would express my anger and frustrations in front of her. I would never react violently towards her, but I would snap at her and occasionally be rude. For which, I would immediately feel guilty and apologize, recognizing that I had done wrong. She was scared of anger, and couldn't handle it. So my anger became a point of conflict between us. Over the course of about a year of living together, we would develop other issues in addition. Nothing major, but little points of confliction that needed to be addressed. This fed into the summer of 2018.\n\n\nShe and I became part of a local group of friends. Most of them were my friends from years prior. We would join them for an annual vacation to a medieval festival and reenactment. Our first time visiting was the year before. This year, we went into it with a few unresolved problems. I couldn't get time off for both weeks, so I could only tag along for the second one. The girlfriend sprung on me the surprise news that she was no longer only going for one week, but instead for the full two. I was a little upset, but I got over it. The issues we faced mostly included distrust due to another friend of ours developing feelings for her, and she often would spend time with him (I suspect that she also had some for him). The other issue of grave importance involved a specific intimate night, which would lead to her blaming me of sexual abuse.\n\n\nOne night, she was incredibly drunk, and I was entirely sober. We had talked about having sex earlier in the evening before drinking. After getting her home, she reverted to what I called \"Hurricane\". The reason for this nickname was because whenever she would get this drunk, she would become belligerent, her emotions unleashed, her lack of inhibitions would shine through, she needed physical support to stay standing in many cases, her lack of balance and coordination would lead to breaking things and knocking them over, and plenty more. Anyway, it was a particularly \"stormy\" night, and I eventually got her into bed. My intentions were to simply put her to bed, but she had other plans. She asked if I wanted to have sex. Which, I admitted that I did, but I told her that it may be a bad idea. She insisted time and time again, and I continued to ask her if she was sure. I eventually caved, and we had very sloppy sex. We discussed me putting her in a diaper as well as her using it for me, but she wasn't sure. So, I put it next to us on the bed. We continued having sex, and when finished, we cuddled. Shortly after, she fell asleep. Normally, she would be sure to put underwear on beforehand. She explained long before that this was due to her fears of getting an infection, and due to her own personal comfort. I searched for her underwear in the immediate area, but they were nowhere to be found. Funny enough, I didn't ever pay attention to them after removing them whenever we had sex. Imagine that. Instead, I saw the pull-up on the bed next to us. So, I hesitantly put it on her to give her something, anything really. I was tired, and given the circumstances, I didn't think anything of it at the time. This choice of undergarment may have been a mistake in and of itself. So, after clothing her, I felt asleep with her in my arms.\n\n\nWake up the next day. She is immediately upset with me, and confronts me about the night before. She becomes increasingly hostile about the situation. Unfortunately, she had no recollection of the night prior, nor of any consent. I expressed to her my feelings and knowledge of the events. Hearing me through, she insists that I took advantage of her. That she didn't consent to sex. I went into extreme detail about everything that happened. She then also refers to the pull-up, and gets even more upset with me. I admit to her that I didn't think it through, but that it was available, and that I had her best interests in mind. I meant no harm, and didn't impose my kinks on her during sex. It was just a form of underwear that I selected given the circumstances. The rest of the time she continued to blame me, and said that I had sexually abused her. Perhaps it was a bad judgement call, and I should have just told her no. However, I never violated her, nor did I cross any lines in having intercourse that night. The only possible genuine mistake I made would have been the diaper. Even that, however, remained a possibility, but was only used for the purposes of providing her underwear. Nothing more.\n\n\nTo this day, she holds that against me. I know what happened that night, and I know that I didn't cross the line. I never violated, abused, or took advantage of her in any way. I'm willing to accept that it was a bad judgement call, but it's not what she makes it out to be. I believe this is something much deeper within her own mind. That regardless of me, this is an unresolved issue that I received the blame for. I would never, ever, do anything like that. Like the man who actually did violate her years ago.\u00a0\n\n\nBack to the summer now. We had these unresolved issues, and they followed us to this event. I had worries, and with what had been going on between us, felt validated in my reaction. She became distant, and sought more space to do whatever she wished without my involvement. I had become a little clingy, and worried that she had other intentions. Given that this event had thousands of people, tons of alcohol, and plenty of open minded and free of taboo practices and ideologies, I was worried that someone might take advantage of her. That due to her frequent alcohol-abuse, she would lower her inhibitions and fall prey to someone else. As there are many people who partake in extremely liberal practices while there. I checked in with her everyday and expressed extreme interest. When I came to visit myself, she didn't behave like she had even missed me. I became emotional, and throughout the entire time we were there, we had intermittent issues. We met someone who became close to both of us, and we even confided in her the details of our recent relationship issues. The time came to pack up and we came back home. Shortly after arriving, the girlfriend prompted me with a proposition.\n\n\nEarlier, she had prompted me with the idea of possibly opening up our relationship, or adding another person. I have always been strictly monogamous, and have been cheated on. Even though I knew I didn't want it, I considered the possibility. The proposition she gave me upon arriving back at home was to include this person we had become friends with. I expressed that I had no feelings about that other person, and that we hardly even knew them. That I still didn't feel comfortable doing anything with anyone else, or allowing her to do the same. Her insisted plan of including someone else kept raising flags in my mind. I prodded her for insight, checking to be sure that it wasn't a desire to attach herself to someone else. I couldn't handle the thought of her leaving me for anyone else. Especially not if that was someone I consented to sharing our sexual relationship with. Now, I don't even believe I would be able to ever do this. I'm willing to invest the trust, but I don't think I could handle seeing or imagining my significant other with anyone else.\n\n\nIt wasn't until September of 2018 that she even found out about my Facebook posts. Shortly after we came back from the medieval event, she found my posts on my computer while I was at work. I came home to her on the couch, and she looked very upset. She told me to sit down. For the next hour or better, she told me what she had found, and accused me of possibly cheating on her. I told her what had happened, and that it meant so little to me that I didn't even remember the posts themselves. That I never cheated on her, and that I only sought validation in myself. I must have apologized a hundred times. I broke her trust in me, and hurt her. Whether or not I did anything is irrelevant. We argued and emotionally responded to one another until we reached an agreement. She asked me what we should do. Though she suggested ending the relationship, I knew that I didn't want that to happen. We agreed that we would ride it out, and if things improved we would allow for that improvement. That we may eventually call it off and end it when the time came.\n\n\nOver the next couple of months, everything felt like a mess. I had an conflict at work which resulted in my leave, and a start at the same workplace as the gf. We started becoming close again, even feeling a lot like we did way back before all of this shit happened. Yet, our problems remained unresolved. Our sex life last year went from little-to-none, to completely non-existent. However, in some ways, it felt like things were also improving slowly. We were looking to move, and had our eyes set on a few different cities. Our plan was to leave by the end of the summer of 2019, to allow us plenty of time to settle things and build up enough sustainability to be able to leave. Plus, it would allow us time to work on our relationship. This sounded like a great plan, but she had ulterior motives, and many secrets.\n\n\nDecember became so much more than a month. In short time, it would become a defining moment in both our lives. She hinted at the idea that we could be leaving even before the end of the year. Which, turned into the possibility of just her leaving. I begged her not to go, and insisted that we could work things through. She humored me, but secretly she had already made up her mind. Early in the month, she disclosed to me her plans to visit her cousin in Denver. One of the cities we had been considering. The night she was supposed to leave, I caved on a feeling I had been having for weeks. I've never invaded someone's privacy like this before, but I opened her phone and read through her texts. What I found derailed everything, and broke my heart.\n\n\nShe had two contacts that she had been extensively talking to. One, a co-worker, and the other was simply named \"Orange Soda\". The discussions between her and \"Orange Soda\" seemed to be happening a lot, and they seemed to message each other fervently. I noticed that when we would be sitting together and watching a show or movie or something, she was always on her phone and seemed to be messaging someone. I asked, but never seriously pried for any information. It was semi-flirtatious, and it could have even been taken as a friendship alone. However, when I referred to the texts between her and the co-worker I realized it was so much more. They discussed the mystery boy, and the co-worker showed support for her to engage with him. Even more, she condoned being flirtatious in return, and suggested that she date and make-out with him. The gf responded telling her that she made plans to go home for the winter break with him. That they would go out on a date, and she would in fact make-out with him.\n\n\nI was broken hearted, and couldn't contain myself. I took her luggage and dropped it at the bottom of the stairs in the snow. I threw her phone across the street at a building, and it broke. Then, I returned and shoved her precious teddy bear into her chest as she slept on the couch. The next half-hour to an hour was filled with us screaming at each other, crying, and so many emotions. She dressed in a slutty outfit and, I threw her out of the house. As she walked out into the cold night, I returned upstairs and slumped against the wall, fell to the floor, and cried uncontrollably. I eventually gathered myself enough to go driving for her fearing that she would walk into town without warm clothes. I didn't find her, so I came back. I found her back in the apartment. We talked, without yelling or screaming, and said we would not talk until she got back. The next several days, I was a disaster. I spent them either laying on the floor crying, laying in bed staring at the empty side crying, or sitting in a chair staring at a noose and crying. I got really good at tying knots.\n\n\nWhen she came back, she found me sitting in the chair in the dark. The noose was gone however. I chose a noose because it symbolized so much more. She can't even look at a noose, as it is relates to trauma from her past, but that's why I picked that.\u00a0 We sat down together, and we talked. I had written her a very long letter, and left her alone to read it. To summarize its contents, I told her how much I loved her, what I had done wrong, and that I was capable of being so much more. That I wanted to rectify my mistakes, and be a better man. I begged her not to leave me alone in the dark. After reading it she joined me in our bedroom. She told me that she had found an apartment, and she was leaving for Denver. And that I couldn't come with her yet. She wanted to take a break, but that we could come back to this relationship later. We also discussed what I had found in her phone, and she insisted that nothing had happened, and that she wouldn't have cheated on me. I didn't believe that last part. Since I had no other options, I agreed to the terms, and we started our break.\n\n\nWith no better options on the table before me, I moved back in with my mom, and have been working on myself since. For a period of time we stayed in contact. Admittedly, I texted her quite frequently, and was still a bit clingy. I've never done anything like this before, and given the context, it has been anything but easy. Since then, I've focused heavily on improving myself. Reading more, keeping a daily journal, writing a lot, working out (lost approximately 10 lbs. and a waist size), cutting back on soda, eating healthier, starting at a new full time job that pays really well, going to counseling, reconnecting with friends and family, minimizing my possessions, working on personal projects and trying things I've never done before, and much, much more.\n\n\nThis all sounds pretty good, doesn't it? Well, aside from my vast improvement, things haven't been so easy. Every single day is a struggle, and I'm still learning how to handle it.\n\n\nWe kept in touch, but we haven't been close. Sure, the beginning of January seemed tolerable, but it eventually fell apart. I was still clinging on, and she wanted space. I would react to some of her posts online or what she said or did unfavorably. For instance, I saw one of her posts she made about harming herself, and not having health insurance to visit the hospital to get help. She thought she might have given herself an infection in the process. I checked on her to be sure she was okay. Another example includes my passive aggressive reaction to her talking about someone who might have had a thing for her. It was childish of me, I know, and I apologized immediately after it happened. Lastly, I wish to cite one night in particular. She had an interview the following morning, but had put off taking a general online assessment for it. When she went to take it, her computer gave her troubles, and she freaked out. I tried to console and help her through it. Instead she became irrationally upset, and directed her emotions onto me by insulting me and treating me like I had done something wrong. I tried reasoning with her, but as she kept getting worse, I wished her luck and told her how awful she was treating me. She eventually got back to me and apologized for her behavior.\n\n\nShortly after she moved to Denver, one of our friends made the decision to move out there as well. And since he needed a place to stay, she volunteered. At first, this sounded like a great idea, and I was in favor. Yet, I would later find out that he is not actually gay, and that he began to develop a crush on her. Knowing our situation, and being one of the closest people to it...he violated my trust. I can't help but feel that he picked a side, when no one wanted him to. Honestly, it feels a lot like what her friends did to her when she chose me over the other guy.\n\n\nSince sometime in January, we've had continued problems. She wants space, and I'm giving her that much. At first, I still would message her plenty, but she insisted I back off. So I did just that, but I didn't want to entirely. I started sending handwritten letters, as I felt that she might appreciate a weekly letter as opposed to an everyday text like I was doing. She seemed to be okay with the letter idea. And I've given her plenty of space, and refrained from sending her a single message in several weeks. But I still think about her every single night and day.\n\n\nShe was kind enough to call me on the 12th of February. It was the fourth anniversary of my father's passing. She knew it would be difficult for me. She also sent me a few messages about the gifts I sent her for Valentine's Day. I sent her an orchid plant, preserved rose, and another letter. The orchid was meant to replace the orchid I had given her a long time ago which unfortunately died. Too bad that when she opened the box, the flowers of this orchid were already wilted. I have no idea if she kept any of what I have her, or if she just tossed it away.\n\n\nOne very important note before I continue any further. Before she left, I gave her my father's wedding band to hold onto. It means a lot to me, and I swore on that ring that I would one day marry her. She told me she still wore it sometimes. I can only hope she wasn't lying.\n\n\nNow, it has been a while since we last spoke. But I've had time to think, and time to assess. Thanks to my wonderful friends, family, counselor, physician, and others who have helped me through this. Whether it be advice or just someone to listen to me talk. However, thanks to them, I now know so much more than before. And I've come to realize quite a few things. Due to my own morbid curiosity, personal reflections, and skills as a detective, I've figured out plenty more on my own.\u00a0\n\n\nI've realized that she is the one who has wronged me. That my feeling sorry and terrible for myself is not necessary. I take responsibility for my own actions, but I should never blame myself for the way she treated me. She always had her issues, sure, but this recent edition of her shows me that she needs to work on herself. That she is the one who needs therapy most of all. She owes it to herself. I don't know exactly what it was that made her so bitter and cruel, but this isn't okay. She abandoned her friends, family, and me when she left. All we ever wanted was to love her, and support her in life, and it seems she has turned her back on all of us.\n\n\nSo, I am faced with the hardest decision I've ever had to make. I know it's not fair, and I can't fully blame either one of us. But, I don't want her to hurt me like this anymore. I deserve so much better than this treatment. I'm done with the lying and infidelity. No more toxicity, abuse, or villainizing. I will not be her excuse anymore. It's time she grows up, takes responsibility, stops playing the victim, and becomes the best person she can be. I know that if she can do that, she will realize that I am right. At least, I hope she will, for the sake of my heart.\n\n\nI will always love her with all of my heart and soul. I gave her my heart the day I met her. Unless someone else walks into my life and changes my mind, there it will remain. My hope is that someday soon, she will get better, realize what she did wrong, and forgive herself. Once she can free herself, then and only then will I be willing to return to her. I can't hold her heart any other way.\n\n\nI am letting go. This isn't a goodbye...this is a see you later. When you're healthy and happy and have forgiven yourself. I love you, forever and always, my Jellybean...\n\n\nTLDR; The only simple answers are to simple questions.

I'm in an emotional abuse relationship, but if I leave I fear I'm going to lose my kid!", "author": "RoseCentaur1916", "self_text": "Hi, I'm a 31 year old female, who is married to a 27 year old male, we have a 4 year old boy. We've been together since the spring of 2013, so 6 years all together, and married 2 years this July. \n\nWhere to start... the beginning I guess... v.v; It wasn't obvious until about a month ago, but my husband is emotionally and mentally abusive. I have a pickle of a situation and have no idea on how to handle it. \n\nIt makes me sick to my stomach even posting this... I don't know if it's fear, guilt, or my denial trying to stop me, but... it has to be said... &gt;.&gt;\n\nI can't really pinpoint when it started, I suppose it had been there all along. He has exhibited all of the behaviors, gaslighting, guilt trips, making me feel cut off from the world, making me feel like if anything goes wrong its my fault, calling me a bad mother so much in fact, he has ne convinced that he'll get full custody, and all over bad person, calling me worthless, and stupid. He denies any wrong doing, and give plentiful amounts of excuses when I try to get him to do anything around the house. \n\nAt first it was small things that weren't very noticeable. For example when we first got together we went through a lot of drama thanks to people we had surrounded ourselves with. One of these people who was supposed to be our friend had hurt me in an awful way and he didn't want me to see her anymore because she had hurt me. He was right, but I felt I should have made that decision myself, even if she had hurt me worse. It was a way to separate me from friendships. It was small things like this instance that went under the radar.\n\nSometime into our first few weeks living together, when we moved into our first apartment, he turned it up a little bit. Our apartment had gotten a bit messy, as it usually does when you're moving, and I had asked him to straighten up a bit. He grunted and nodded, indicating that he had heard me and would help. I then went off to work and came back and he hadn't done a fricken thing! It was still messy, so I got upset. He said I was over reacting, and that because he worked a manufacturing job which was \"harder work\" than my retail job, that I should do it, (an argument he continues to use.) I was not having that and I lost it. He then preceeded to give me the cold shoulder for the next 42 hours. When he finally started talking to me again he told me I had to put all of my books in storage, because it was what he called \"most of the mess\" and then he would proceed to pick up. My books were my first love in this world, and my first best friends and he knew that, and he said it just to hurt me. He did eventually pick up after I abandonded my books in the basement.\n\nLater when I got pregnant for our son he ratcheted it  up a bit further. He and my mother could never agree on anything. He wouldn't help me with chores, and Mom (even though I told her to stay out of it) would badger him to help. He wouldn't let me have any of my food cravings or respect my food adversions. One night I wanted a barbecue bacon hamburger so bad I couldn't see straight, and because he didn't want to leave the apartmnet and we had chicken, I should just have chicken. I was starving, and this would most likely would have been my second meal that day. I understand his suggestion because we were strapped for cash, but I was strongly adverse to chicken, just the thought of it at the time made me want to vomit. He denied me and went to bed. I cried and called my Mom who found a place that made the hamburger I wanted and delievered and ordered it for me. There are many instances like this throughout my pregnancy. He would deny me what I wanted/needed and would get stuff for himelf all of the time. He still does this.\n\nEven when I gave birth our son he made it all about him. I had the room too cold for his liking and wanted the heat turned up, but because my Mom was there, she and the nurses made sure that the room was kept the way I wanted it. I am so thankful to them! \n\nLater after our son was born he would verbally beat me down for wanting to spend time with my family and leave him with the baby for one night a week! It was only a shopping trip to get food, or supplies for our son! I wasn't even gone that long and he would blow up my phone asking when I would be home. I'd tell him an hour, and if it passed even a second after the hour he'd freak out! Though, when our son was weeks old he would go out with his friends (whom have since disappeared) and I wouldn't blow up his phone for answers!\n\nEven when my Father was in a coma, dieing from a motorcycle accident, he made to be all about him, using the baby as an excuse! He said he should take the baby with me to the ICU! Are you kidding me?! The ICU is the last place a baby should be! It could be very traumatizing for a 5 month old! It could have been traumatizing for him to see his Grandpapa hooked up to machines and tubes and I was not going to have that be his last memory of his Grandpapa even if he hadn't been making memories yet. He said it was because our son missed me. I get that, but as my boyfriend and his father (who wasn't working at the time anyway), during this hard time, it was his job to be at home with the baby.\n\nWhen we moved out of my mother's place and into our current apartment I had to quit my job, because living on our own I could no longer work my previous job, because I had no way to get there. The entire time I wasn't working I kept up with all of the chores and everything. I then aquired a job at a local factory, but because my family was on a different scheduale than I was it was hard to get groceries, and I hated the work. I lasted 3 months. In those 3 months I slipped on my housekeeping duties and he refused to help, and so the house got progressively worse, and I couldn't keep up, my depression didn't help either. Well, now he didn't have the excuse that I had an easier job, so I had to clean up everything, and he turned to guilt tactics, and name calling. He would pick up a little sure, but just to say he kept up his end of the chores. He still refuses to touch the kitchen, because I joked that I wanted to be the only one to clean the kitchen when we first moved in. I then quit that job, and proceeded to actively look for jobs through the summer. I also made sure we were fed by going to food pantries all summer. At the tail end of the summer I had found a new job. The whole summer though he belittled me, and picked fights with me, just because I was having a hard time finding another job. He would constantly gaslight me, and use my bad temper (which flaired up in the summer heat) to do it.\n\nHe would do this where ever. I'll be the first to admit I have an explosive temper, but it gets worse when I am egged on and gaslighted. He would add more fuel and gunpowder to the fire per se.\n\nThen I got another job at the end of summer 2016, and he was happy for a while. He and I agreed when I had gotten a new job, that because I would be making less, the only bill I had to pay was my phone bill. The very day I recieved my first paycheck he renigged on me and said I had to help him pay rent he had said nothing, absolutely nothing! About helping him pay rent. I was furious! He ended up saying that he had told me when he hadn't and made me feel like I was crazy! \n\nHe laid low on the controlling behavior, and manipulative behaviors for a while other than the pissing contest of whomever had the harder job and who should clean, and help clean up until I quit my most recent job. He'd also throw hus depressin in there for a little added spice. (which was not the job I had gotten at the end of 2016, the job I quit was one he cohersed me into getting and I hated, but those stories are for a whole other post!). Then he gave me a month, and he started in on me harder than he ever has before. He became so bad that I have fallen out of love with him and am now afriad of him.\n\nHe about a month ago tore into me about not having a job, and that I wasn't looking for one because I wasn't out pounding the pavement. Anyone who has expertise in retail and customer service knows that all of the applications are online for any big retailer, food chain, et cetera. The only ones that have physical walk in the door applications are small Mom and Pop shops. He tore into me hard. By this point we had been married for a year and 6 months. He said he was going to treat me like a roommate rather than a wife and deny me food! Thats not just mean thats down right cruel. He said all of that in front of our now 4 year old son! He bitches and complains about me to our son behind my back and our son has started treating me the same way not knowing any better.\n\nI have been going to my mothers off and on since then with my son in tow. My latest visit has been over a week, but since my husband refuses to pay my phone bill and wants me to use his phone, I don't feel safe going \"home,\" because I no longer have a way to call for help. I know I need to go back especally to gather evidence of his mental and emotional abuse. I'm terrified that once I and my son go in, only one of us, or neither of us will come out. \n\nI swear since we got married in July 2017, he thinks of me now as his property instead of a person.\n\nI have been applying for jobs since we arrived on my birthday (which I nearly forgot, and he used as another day to tear into me, and remind me that since I'm not contributing that I basically don't deserve one), and want to divorce him, but I'm also afraid that I'll lose my little boy to him, and I don't want my boy in his clutches, to be twisted to become like him!

I still have nightmares about discovering the truth and the disgust and pain I felt. I still dream about the lies that she told me, straight to my face. I had asked her multiple times if she had found someone else while after being ghosted for weeks, and each time she told me no and wondered why I was being suspicious. But I already knew the answer. I had seen the picture of them online with their arms around each other, and being told by one of my friends that she was hanging out a lot around this one guy (just for some perspective, we're both freshman in the same college, and this guy is applying to grad schools).\n\nI searched for answers, and in place I found a love letter written to her new supply from her, here on reddit. As if all that wasn't enough, I had also ran into them going on a date one night about a month ago, as she's all dressed up and telling the people around us how she's going on a date with this guy. And I just had to sit there and fucking take it. Why she had to lie to me, I'll never know, and what she really did with this guy while I was being ghosted is only up to imagination now. I just wish I didn't have to become this detective. It's been over 6 months and I still have these same dreams.

I decided to just let it be and let her learn for herself and hopefully she wouldn't be hurt. \n\nFunnily enough, I got a dm two days ago from her asking if we could talk. My heart started racing and I instantly started sweating. I told her of course and tried to play like I didn't know who exactly she was. She went on to describe who she was and that she had been speaking with my nex for a couple months after he found her seemingly randomly on Facebook. Turns out he has been harassing her all hours of the day and night with texts and calls and it got to a point where she couldn't take it anymore. She started asking around if nex had any type of mental illness and a friend told her what he did to me. \n\nI told her my side of the story and showed a couple pictures as proof and turns out he never mentioned me to her. That stung. She was astonished to say the least and was hurt that he was starting to love bomb her after having just stepped out of a relationship that was over a decade long. It made her realize that she wasn't special to him at all, she was just someone to fill an empty space. The thing is they were supposed to have their first date tonight and she got to me in time to find out that she wants nothing to do with him. \n\nIsnt it funny how things work out? At first I felt extremely validated and my mood perked up a bit because she came to me, I didn't \"seek revenge\", I did the right thing because someone asked me to. But then something weird happened tonight. See, she didn't properly cancel with him, she just blocked and went NC like I told her I did. So I'm sitting here minding my own business and I became swept with this awful, palpable...sorrow? Sympathy? I'm not sure. I picture him sitting at a table at a restaurant waiting for this girl to show up and realizing hes been stood up and it makes me feel so awful I cry. I feel so sorry for him I dont know what to do. It's not the type of \"feeling awful\" about MYSELF that everyone on this sub describes when you seek revenge, I feel awful for HIM. It's like I see him as the poor kid getting picked last for dodgeball in grade school. I always felt sorry for \"that kid\" when I was younger, so my natural inclination is to reach out and comfort him but I cant. It's such a mind fuck. I'm glad this girl was smart enough to do some research and I'm glad I've made a new friend but how do I handle this new, foreign feeling?\n\nI appreciate your time.

He convinced them the rectory was a \u201csafe space\u201d to drink underage. I was one of these children that participated, yet was always asked to leave before the altar boys. David spent MANY nights at the rectory and would return in the early mornings hungover. His parents, Michael &amp; Carol Schuster, Joe Maher, and Fr. Perrone allowed this to happen and encouraged him to continue this behavior. \n\nDavid became the right hand man of Joe Maher and Fr. Perrone for Opus Bono Sacerdotii. He would be assigned to sex offender priests, bishops, and cardinals to be their personal assistant for anything durning their visits. He was rewarded handsomely with large paychecks every week and was knighted the youngest Knight of Columbus in history with his own chapter at Assumption Grotto Church with Perrone as Chaplin. David now runs Perrone\u2019s altar boys and hosts an \u201call male\u201dretreat where no mothers or women are allowed to stay the night, only the men &amp; priests.

I have an autoimmune disease that is kinda opposite of diabetes. I haven't had it get this bad except a handful of times last year. I actually physically passed out (not asleep) Tuesday night while on the phone with SO. He didn't notice, nor care.

He literally somehow talked me into coming to his place on Saturday at 6am... for an 8 hour bus ride WITH MY CAT. I SAID OKAY. I couldn't find a babysitter for my cat. I will be there for a few days and have to come back a few days later. Literally 2 days ago I was so sick I passed out twice and almost had a seizure. WTF am I doing?

They aren\u2019t triggered by anything in particular, like a lot of stress or something related to it happening that day. They just\u2026sort of happen randomly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll my nightmares/flashbacks happened after high school. I\u2019m in my mid 20s now, and have been living on my own and away from my mother. She\u2019s the main source of my trauma. Lots of emotional abuse and gas lighting. Manipulation. Making me doubt myself because I have autism. Made me hate my dad (divorced) all my life and left many psychological scars that are healing and have been acknowledged, but still sting now and again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI may be bipolar, and was diagnosed from a hospital stay (anxiety attack) but then undiagnosed by a psychologist who knew me better later in life. I am certainly manic if I am off my meds, which I know to take regularly and they help keep my mood, anxiety, and depression stable. I am dealing with life quite well all things considered, and have learned to cope, but I still keep getting nightmares and flashbacks to things I thought I had come to peace with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tend to forget my nightmares very quickly, so I never really remember to bring them up at my therapist appointments. And they don\u2019t really bother me in my day to day life. But they are so horrific and so vivid and so strong that I wake up in a cold sweat and an awful feeling in my gut that takes a few hours to go away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey are mostly due to fears of my mother (emotionally) hurting me. Berating me. Telling me I\u2019m wrong or forcing me to do something that would trigger my anxiety.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA recurring theme is my mother and step father (both white) having a child of their own, and me (my bio mother\u2019s child, mixed race due to black bio dad) being left behind or feeling like an outsider.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was always a fear I had even though my mother never had another child. I always knew I would hate that child. That I would be considered an adopted child when I was a biological one. That me being the mixed-race child of two white parents made me less legitimate somehow. Even though I had no problem with others being adopted. Had I actually been adopted by my mother and step-father, I doubt this would bother me as much. Hell, to this day, if I ever had kids, I would ONLY adopt or foster, never have my own bio kids.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut for some reason it still bothers me. I mainly feared the other child would be born a white-raced boy: the thing I always wished I would be. But instead I was born a mixed-race girl.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am transitioning to be male, and have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. But there\u2019s nothing I can do about my race, not that I\u2019d want to even if I could. I just have these strange thoughts about being mixed with a mind that doesn\u2019t match that identity. It just doesn\u2019t seem to click for me.I very likely have racial dysphoria, as I was raised \u201cculturally white\u201d and had mostly white family and friends.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI never questioned my race until I was bullied later in life for not fitting in with racial stereotypes. But despite the actual physical abuse I received from my black peers, I never have nightmares about that. Oddly enough, that never bothers me. I kind of resolved it mentally one day by standing up to my bullies, and just like that, the bullying stoped.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI haven\u2019t had a chance to do that with my other traumas.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd so, I continue to have these nightmares about the horrible thoughts my mother put into my head about my father doing terrible things to me, about the terrible things my mom DID do to me, and every so often, sexual abuse. It\u2019s rare, but there was a dream that things I am certain never happened to me happened very vividly, and even while unconscious and asleep, I could FEEL it. I woke up in a could sweat, shaken to my core. I felt sick to my stomach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI rarely have sexual dreams.

I was reminded of this because I had one just today, and I was able to see and feel genital stimulation. I didn\u2019t feel anything pleasurable or painful about it, just that it was happening and it was not something I minded but didn\u2019t really want either. Just\u2026meh.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don\u2019t know if my lack of sexual dreams come from some sort of dysphoria or repressed sexual trauma. I can\u2019t think of anything that would count as an event to say \u201cYes, this happened to me,\u201d but I feel like something did. I can\u2019t explain why I was so oddly sexual as a child. Maybe it\u2019s my autism. Maybe something did happen to me as a kid. But the way I acted as a kid was not normal and I feel like someone should have noticed it sooner. My sexual identity is a mess and I still don\u2019t understand what to do with myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\u2019m pretty lost as to where to go from here.

I currently see a therapist, I've been diagnosed with depression and C-PTSD, and I take medication for anxiety. \n\nBut for the past few weeks, I've been having bad nightmares; some about real events, some about how they made me feel and situation similar to real events.\n\nWhen I was growing up, elementary school years, my mom was never emotionally present. Shit, she was barely physically present. We lived with her and she was pretty much either hiding in her room or somewhere else. During these years, she was a barely functioning alcoholic and an on-and-off drug user. Idk what drugs, but she had a lot of random people come over and party often; hiding in her room with her on and off. Sometimes forgetting to feed my brother and I.\nA lot of sex things went down. Random people in the living room once. But the worst was her having sex with this guy that she was dating at the time, hated the bastard, while they were high. He left the room to go to the bathroom, leaving the door wide open, to reveal my naked mother. Who proceeded to look at me, smirk, and slap her ass at me. I remember feeling so fucking weird?? I wasn't entirely pissed or sad, I just felt so so wrong. I locked myself in my room and didn't talk to them for the rest of the night; not that they noticed.\nI also had a hard time with relationships. I was only close to my grandpa, who on-and-off raised me. He was always emotionally there for me in my younger years. But that wasn't enough to teach a child social etiquette. I was very blunt and distant as a child. I still smiled and played with kids occasionally but I would often be cold and quick to dismiss them if they annoyed or disagreed with me. But it was much, much worse with teachers. I wouldn't look them in the eyes, I wouldn't respond to them, I wouldn't do anything. Not in the, 'this is a shy kid' way, but in a, 'this child literally doesn't seem to notice me' way. The teachers thought I may have been deaf. Trips to the doctor proved that I wasn't. Next, they assumed I may have been on the autistic spectrum. Tests later, I wasn't. The pretty much wrapped it up by saying, \"She just lacks confidence.\" Which...wasn't entirely true, considering I got into fist fights with kids over not believing in dragons Lol. I think it was from the neglect.\n\nSmashed cut to a few years later, my mom has two more kids. They're 10-13 years apart from myself. I'm in middle school around this time and this is where things start to go south for me. My mom decided she wants to go to school to get a degree. She'll be doing it online so she can stay at home with the kids and not worry about a baby sitter. Long story short, we supported her decision and she signed up. Her first math class. Fuck, do I remember how panicked and angry she was over failing the test. I remember her muttering to herself over it and I asked her what was wrong. She immediately lashed out at me and told me to 'fuck off'. It was so out of character for her, it offended my younger self. I left the room feeling down but eventually brushed it off. As the classes went on, so did her anger. She would get pissed when the kids would make ANY loudish sound. She would come barreling out of the screaming at all of us to shut up.\n\nAnd then the hitting started. She was very vocal on how much she HATED my interests. She hated that I drew anime and watched it. I hardly ever mentioned anything of it to her, and I never took on weeaboo traits or anything like that. I just liked naruto a lot at the time Lol. But I remember I was struggling with art one day. I was frustrated and went to her room crying about how it wasn't turning out right and that my other friend was better at drawing. She very irritatedly responded with, \"Well, maybe if you stopped drawing that anime shit, you'd actually have fucking talent.\"\nIt hurt so fucking bad to hear that. I remember being in shock at first. I was so crushed by this, all I said was, \"You're such a bad mom!\" And I high tailed it out the room to cry. I was in bed and she walked in with an energy I never felt before. I thought she would come in to comfort me when all of the sudden, she slapped my in the face. I was so shocked I couldn't move at first. She then continued to hit me; mostly slapping. I covered myself as best as I could but she crawled on top of me and lashed out. Literally slapping with everything she had. After she was through, she just pointed a sharp finger in my face and said, \"Don't ever talk back to me like that again.\" I was so shocked and torn up inside, I experienced my first panic attack. I was crying so hard, I made myself throw up foam in the toilet. My dad was in the other room and he did literally nothing. And that was my very first experience of my mom hitting me.\n\nAfter that, it stayed like that. But it got worse. I was going into high school and my siblings where now toddlers. My sister, I lover her dearly but she turned into a brat. My two brothers pretty much hid behind playing xbox all day. My brother entertained my youngest brother and I took care of my younger sister; definitely the hardest out of the two. I love her very very much, but she was very spoiled. With my parents not raising her, mom doing school and dad working through all of the day and night to provide for a family of 6, she got whatever she wanted. Which included me entertaining her at her beckoned call, giving her whatever she wanted that was mine, and having her sleep in my room almost every single night.\nWhenever I didn't want to play dolls for what felt like the 50th time of the week or I didn't want to give her a toy because it was special and held memories, she would cry to mom. And that would result in my mother hitting me. It went from slapping to full on punching. And the put downs turned into name calling and worse. Almost everyday, she would treat me horribly. She would tell me how, \"I would never get a boyfriend.\" And, \"I wasn't pretty enough.\" And, \"I wish you would just kill yourself already.\" I was 5'8\" and 140lbs. She would constantly make mean remarks about my body. I was a healthy weight and she was so mean that I developed an eating disorder in later years; anorexia.\nShe would constantly put down things I liked, my art, anime, my style, my music, my hair (naturally wavy), my makeup. Even though I did EVERYTHING she told me to do, it still wasn't good enough. \"Fix your hair, it looks like shit when you don't straighten it.\" Or, \"Wear makeup. You look fucking dead and ugly without it.\" Nothing was good enough.\nEveryday I looked in the mirror, I felt like I was so grotesque. I felt like I was a fucking monster. And even when people said, \"It's what on the inside that counts.\" She made me hate that too. I was a relatively lively girl. I was optimistic, responsible, honest, and loyal. I had my flaws for sure. I was emotional at times, selfish at times, judgmental at times, and I suppose vain (since I became so focused on being perfect for mom). But those flaws weren't ever over baring. I was such a straight laced teenager.\nI never drank, snuck out, dig drugs, lied. None of that. The worst I'd ever do was fail a class and that was because I never had time to do my homework.\nAt home, I cleaned the house every. Single. Day. I cannot emphasize that enough. Toddlers were messy as fuck, toys and food were always everywhere at some point. We rented a two story house that was pretty big. We were a family of 6, after all. We struggled with money because of that. But I cleaned that house everyday with NO HELP. I asked my brother here and there and he would never help. I learned to stop asking him. Occasionally he'd get into fights with my Dad over having to do yard work but that's about all he had to do. I washed dishes, did laundry, vacuumed, swept, mopped, cleaned bathrooms, cooked dinner. You name it. I did all of my moms work while she did school shit and watched tv. All she had to do was watch the kids while I was at school; which fucks me up today because I imagine she'd beat my sister at some points through out the day. \nI could never leave the house. I was lucky if I left to go to my friends once a month. It really took a toll on my social life. My brother could go see his biological father every other weekend AND go see his friends occasionally. When I asked why, my mom made the excuse of, \"Well, it's his dad.\" When I asked to see my biological father, she said, \"Fuck no.\" (Met him later on, he fucking sucked but he wasn't terrible. My mom and him just had bad blood). But it pissed me off. She treated me and my sister like shit, while our brothers got...well.. at least NOT treated like shit because they were hiding downstairs play video games every single day. \nI really don't want to be harsh to my brother. He was a boy in middle school going through his own things. I'm sure things were hard on him at times too and I love him very, very much. But he wasn't present for any of it; even most of the abuse. When I began talking about how Mom was abusive, he didn't even know what the fuck I was talking about and pretty much didn't want to talk about it because he hates conflict. So please be kind to him; he was just a young boy doing his best to survive in that household, I think.\n\nThe physical abuse ended at some point. Junior year of high school. Mom beat me pretty bad at the wrong time. My sister spilled nail polish remover in my moms bathroom. I knew she'd be pissed. Later in the night, totally forgot about it until I was washing and Mom came down to the bathroom, all angry like, and was like, \"Why does my bathroom smell like nail polish remover?\" I told her I accidentally spilled it and she immediately slapped me in my wet face. She was asking the same question over and over; all while slapping me. I was trying to desperately get away from her; climbing on the sink and get shoved into the mirror which resulted in it getting knocked down. I tried to break away and she grabbed my hair and pulled me back to her; punching me more. Tried to get away again and she put me in a head lock and literally almost knocked me the fuck out. My siblings were crying for her to let me go. I told my brother to get the kids out of here and to not see this. He listened. (Another thing that confuses me on how he doesn't understand how  what I went through was abuse when he literally saw all of this happening and was also crying..). She said mean shit. I eventually said fuck it and said mean stuff back. Something along the lines of, \"No one in this house loves you!! They're all just nice to you because we're scared of you and you know it!! Fuck you!!\" Stuff like that while she was hitting me. I never hit back but I did try to push her off me, for once, during this fight. It went on for HOURS. Starting the bathroom, ending in my room. My sister got pushed into the dresser at one point trying to stop her. The fight started around 10:00 and finally ended at 2:00 am.\nNormally, there was a, \"I'm sorry. I love you.\" At the end of it all and, \"It'll get better once I'm out of school.. I promise.\" But not that night. Got up the next morning at 6:00 am, caught the bus, and...cried my eyes out at school. I didn't have time to have a break down at home and I just broke down and cried in the hall way. An old friend saw me crying asked what happened. I eventually told her on Skype, two days later; a Thursday. She was so fucking scared for my life, she immediately told her mom. The next day, I got called to the office. I was going to youth group with my friends that night so, I thought it was just my friends sister picking us up. When I saw my friends Mom and the school police officer behind me, it clicked. I started to cry, panic, begged. Everything. I was scared to go to the Attention Home. I was scared that they would take me and my siblings away and it would ruin their lives for good. \"But the toddlers are young, they'll forget about it.\" But the second oldest wasn't! He was in middle school. It would fuck him up! I begged and pleaded but I eventually caved. I was so scared. I couldn't stop crying and shaking the whole way through the investigation. I stayed at the Attention Home for about a week. I wanted to be taken out of the house, but I wanted my siblings to stay. I didn't want to ruin their lives.  They said no. I had to go, they had to go.\nI eventually stopped cooperating all together. Telling them I didn't want to leave and that I wanted to go home. They eventually let me go home and dropped the case; visiting me once a month every now and then to see if I was still alright.\nShe stopped hitting me then. Was still mean to me with her words, but didn't touch me again.\n\nThe reason I ask if this was abuse is because I had a shitty friend, same friend who got the police involved, who basically stopped caring because I refused to be taken out of my house and couldn't see her anymore. She started to downplay my pain a lot and said she met other people who had 'worse' abuse stories. Still thought mine was bad, but others had it worse so I had to get over it, in her eyes. Also, my mom constantly gas lighted me. Whenever I called her out on her behavior and said other moms didn't do what she did, she'd say, \"Yeah they do. They just do it behind closed doors.\" Or tell me I was crazy for thinking she was abusive.\n\nSo..yeah. That's the majority of my story. There's much more that I left out, obviously. But it all basically played out like this on an almost everyday occurrence. \n\nSo was this neglect and abuse??? For sure??\n\nThank you for taking the time to read it and thank you for helping me find the strength in myself to believe in myself. I was shaking so bad writing this all. I just hope to god she never sees it. I hope you have a good day.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

When I was a kid, my best friend (who was a girl - I am also a girl) abused me. We were friends from around age 3/4 to 15. I remember her emotionally abusing me, and I remember her covertly sexually abusing me. I have had flashbacks and dreams about her raping me but I do not have conscious memories about this happening, so I'm not sure if it actually did or not. \n\nI am bisexual. I'm 20 and only just coming to terms with this, although looking back, there have been signs for a long time. And now thinking back to the abuse....it scares me. Our friendship was very much like a relationship. I wonder sometimes if maybe I was attracted to her even though she was abusing me. I remember I used to really like cuddling with her when she would spend the night. I don't know if that's because she abused me and I was conditioned to think certain sexual things were normal or if it's because I was attracted to her.\n\nIt just sort of makes me feel like my sexuality is a product of my abuse.

For a long time he would call me names when we fought, usually saying I\u2019m dumb or saying that I hadn\u2019t said anything smart during the whole conversation. A few days ago, we got into a huge fight because he called me retarded in what he says was a joke, but I didn\u2019t think it sounded like that. After a while I left the conversation and he said that I was on thin ice (because he hates when I walk away from him). I was very angry after being insulted for a couple hours and never calling him a single name or raising my voice. I went back and said that I know I could have handled my self better and maybe I should have brushed off what he said as a joke, but I was still mad about the way he had talked to me. I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to apologize and so when he came back to talk to me, he said I should leave if I\u2019m not going to change my mind about it. I said fine and decided I was going to go in the morning. But then I started crying and asked him to give me some time to myself, but he stayed and eventually convinced me that I should stay and I ended up apologizing to him. He promised that he wouldn\u2019t insult me anymore because it wasn\u2019t \u201cworking.\u201d Jesus this isn\u2019t actually relevant to my question but I guess it\u2019s just been on my mind. \n\nSo yesterday, we got into another fight. I don\u2019t remember the details very clearly. I usually zone out after a few hours of arguing because I know that he will just follow me around if I try to disengage or take a break to collect myself. Anyways, I mentioned to him that he does this thing a lot where I will say something to him and he will go on a rant for a couple minutes about things that disagree with what I said, and then when I ask why he doesn\u2019t like my idea he will be like \u201coh obviously I agree with you I was just bringing up some other points.\u201d So I asked if when he\u2019s gonna do that, he could just start by saying something like \u201cyeah I agree\u201d or \u201cI get what you\u2019re saying\u201d and then talk about the things that disagree with me. He quickly made the conversation about how I always have an attitude like I\u2019m better than him. I asked him what I could do differently and he said \u201cjust don\u2019t act like you have moral high ground\u201d I asked if he could clarify what things made it seem like I think that and he said that I just don\u2019t understand social situations and that anybody who was capable of change would know what he was talking about. Also, during this conversation, multiple times, he would say stuff like \u201cI\u2019m just trying to think of a nicer word since I\u2019m not allowed to call you dumb.\u201d And I couldn\u2019t get made at him because he technically didn\u2019t break his promise. He would not go back to talking about the thing that I brought up for hours. I eventually got him to talk about it and he said that he had agreed with me in the first place and that my issue didn\u2019t happen like I said it did. He\u2019s said thing like this to me before, so I usually try to avoid arguing about the specifics of what happened in a conversation. I said that it didn\u2019t seem like he agreed with me and he told me I was gaslighting him. He says this almost every time we argue. I believed him 100% for a long time I always promised to be better about it, but I\u2019m really starting to doubt it. He always gets to be right about what happened in the end. I could be wrong, but I\u2019m pretty sure in order to gaslight someone, you have to actually convince them. He tells me that I\u2019m lying to him, but I know deep down that I don\u2019t say thing that I don\u2019t believe are true. Even if I\u2019m wrong, I wouldn\u2019t say anything to intentionally make him doubt himself. He says he feels crazy because of me but I always agree with him in the end and I come out of it confused. I admitted a long time ago that I just have a bad memory and whenever I say something he doesn\u2019t think happened I say something like \u201cokay maybe it happened like that\u201d or \u201cI guess we disagree so let\u2019s talk about something else\u201d. I don\u2019t think I pressure him into believing my side. By the end of every argument I feel like my head is in a fog and I can barely make coherent sentences, which he will say makes him right about whatever stupid thing we started arguing about 5 hours ago. I just don\u2019t know. Is it possible that I\u2019m abusing him or is he trying to convince me that I am, when he is the one who is gaslighting? \n\nI\u2019m sorry that turned into a rant and I don\u2019t know if all of it makes sense. I\u2019m happy to answer any questions to clear things up or give more info about this incident or the relationship in general. I just need some support and advice. ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Dont walk, dont try diplomacy, and sure as hell retaliate", "author": "chaosandcorndogs", "self_text": "A narcissist will hold on to grudges for a lifetime, and maybe longer. When I finally pinpointed the source of my negative feelings, I got the fuck out of there. They'll push you to the brink of self destruction then step in to fix their mess just to look like the hero.\n\nIt started a years ago but just saw it a couple weeks ago. The patterns were uncanny for someone who says they're a \"changed person\". Actually, I caught on about 2 years ago and remained cautious because I didnt want to act on my gut instinct(trust you gut). I just let it play out because I didnt want to be alone. Nowadays, I'm all for being alone. And this is all I can think about right now. I'm not comfortable admitting this, but they get into your mind and alter you core values. Thankfully I made it out alive. I will never seek revenge because I'm above that, but their actions have left a permanent stain on my soul that will never allow me to trust another person in this lifetime.\n\nI recently ended an almost 4 year relationship because I thought he was the source of my abuse. I confronted him on numerous occasions and we talked it out many many times. He presented logic in such a confident way that I started questioning it. I thought he was gaslighting me but looking back that couldnt be farther from the truth. The truth of the matter was that there was a narcissist present in my life; and I could sense it with every fiber in my being, but I was unable to see it because of my blind faith and loyalty to family that I couldn't see that the abuse was right in from of my face.\n\nLooking back, I noticed how obvious the red flags were and feel like a fool for allowing myself to be put through the ringer time and time again. My abuser is family through marriage, so thankfully I'm not obligated to stick around. I listened to her disrespect her actual family and rundown her own mother just to witness her flip a switch when they would come around and act like nothing was wrong. She spent over a year talking shit about their insecurities and shortcomings, and this last time I just sat and waited for my turn to roll around to be the \"bad guy\". Sure as shit, the tables began to turn and I was becoming irrelevant yet again.\n\nNarcissist have the power of manipulation and have the ability to start wars for their own personal pleasure. I do not mind being the bad guy, but I still feel bad for the ones who are stuck in her grasp. That is why I'm not angry with the people with who she turned against me. I did not want to be right on this, and I was actually praying that I was wrong. I was mentally exhausted and confronted her and was hoping that she'd tell me I'm wrong. I saw the snake within her and it was one of the most scariest moments of my life. I probably spent 3 days trying to figure out what to do and all the google searched pretty much came up with the same results. I didnt have the energy to fight, and frankly didnt find it necessary to play her mind games any longer. Game over for me.\n\nOne red flag I would have seen had I not been so fixated on the idea of my ex being the narc was when I was investigating narcissism on YouTube. I was playing videos that listed symptoms of NPD. She got ridiculously uncomfortable. It triggered her passive aggressive and condescending side. See, at that point, I didnt divulge any deets about what and why I was investigating. She told me that I shouldnt listen to people who arent accredited. That's putting it lightly, though. She was a lot more rude about it. Imagine someone saying that in an extremely condescending tone and making you feel like shit for trying to spot toxic energies. I'm not trying to expose her for the snake she is. I'm just happy I made it out alive and with my sanity intact. \n\nAnother notable attribution of her personality that leads me to suspect is her desire for notarity. One instance stands out to me that I remember vividly. A director at an institution we belong to has the ability to advance the narcissists career and the narc kisses ass pretty good. I remember the narc saying how she suspects that the director feels awkward because of the love bombing or excessive complimenting. Well dont do it, amirite? This is kind of what I said in a nutshell. The narc was visible shook by this so I just asked \"why do you care what she thinks so much?\" The narc just looked at me like I just committed a mortal sin. \n\nWorst part of this whole thing is that she will eventually be responsible for people's health and wellbeing. I'm caught in a moral dilemma but good. I'm not in any way going to expose the snake, but I feel bad for her future patients.\n\nWhen I realized how and who she was, I felt dirty. She managed to make me feel like the most insignificant being on earth and she had no remorse. One characteristic of these sorts of people is their ability to make you feel bad for thinking this way. For using your gut. They'll convince you that you're just paranoid and have to start trusting more freely.\n\nIt's been close to 3 weeks and I'm no where close to being fixed or rid of the situation. BUT I dont feel anxious, nervous, or trapped anymore. The people she turned against me are throwing passive aggressive bs my way but it doesnt bother me, nor am I angry about it. Starve a narcissist by not feeding the snake. If this helps one person, then it's worth it for me!\n\nLast point I'd like to make is how crucial it is to not try and bring it up to them. Dont do anything too extreme but dont try and expose them because they will ruin your life if they know you're on to them. Do not let your ego cause you harm! Just let this one slide and run the fuck away as fast and far as you can. First do experiments like prolonged absences from that person you suspect, if you can. If your energy becomes stable while the absence then the possibility is high that they're negative energies and you need to get yourself out and fast. \n\nRemember, you're not a narcissist abuse victim.

And there is a TLDR at the bottom.\n She raised my sister and I up to where I was 6 months old (my sis is older than me by a year so she was 2 and can remember some of the stuff she did). \n\nShe wouldn't feed us sometimes and would put stuff in my milk bottle to make me sick. She tried to get pity from every single person she met and threatened my male family members who called her out on her abusive actions by saying that she'd report them to the police for r@ping her - which the DID NOT and WOULD NEVER do to someone.\n\nMy dad confronted her about leaving us on my grandma's doorstep one day and not even telling grandma we were there and she kicked his head into and THROUGH the driver's side window. She goes into the police station (which was right around the corner, go figure) and says that HE kicked HER through the window. But of course, the shattered glass in his clothes and cuts all over his face proved otherwise as he carried my sister and I in as we were crying.\n\nHe took her to court and won a custody battle and had a restraining order put out on her. She broke it, of course, and got arrested. I only found out about this when I googled my last name in a mugshot searching website.\n\nBasically, she's all kinds of fucked up. Not to mention she has Ehlers Danlos (basically a degenerative cartilage disease) and we have it too. It causes lock jaw, dislocations, hypermobility, etc. And it sucks. My sister can't even walk anymore because the tendon in her left leg wont tighten anymore because of all the dislocations! I'm starting to suffer the symptoms of EDS myself with my legs popping out of the socket in my hip all the time. Munchausen Mom goes to the hospital and uses this to her advantage all the time.\n\nHere's the post she sent to me and my sister while we were meeting the son of the woman who I actually consider to be my mom.\n\n\"I love you both very much, and I miss you more than you could imagine. You are always in my thoughts &amp; my heart. You have both grown up not really knowing me. You have, I'm sure, been told God only knows what about me. Whatever you have been told about me must not be accurate though, because if you knew the truth about me &amp; who I am, you would act differently than you do now, you would act like I was actually an important person in your life. I don't blame you girls for what you believe because you were never really given the chance to truly get to know me. But, both of yo are old enough now to decide for yourselves about whether or not you want me in your life, and you have both chosen not to. I had tried to lie to myself about it but I finally had to admit the truth. Neither of you make an effort to get to know me, to message me, to call me...Neither one of you has reached out to me in any way. I have tried reaching out to both of you, but it hasn't done me any good so far. But, it has caused me an almost endless amount of heartache &amp; pain, tears &amp; self-hatred, and an endless amount of what-ifs. Well, I am going to take a moment to straighten out a few things. First of all, I did not want to leave you girls, I only wanted to leave your dad because things were not good between us; that had nothing to do with the two of you. But there was a big difference between me &amp; your dad...I didn't have family to lean on, I didn't have a vehicle because he had made sure the car was in his name &amp; he took it, and I didn't have any money which meant I didn't even have anywhere to live. I had to do what was in your best interest at the time (and being homeless &amp; on the streets was no place for you two). So, if you fault me for that, then I will take the blame for that. But I never once stopped loving you or wanting you with me. Your dad is the one who has fought to keep me from being in your lives, and he has succeeded. I am not a perfect person, and I never claimed to be. But I am not a bad person. I always try to treat people right, lend a helping hand whenever possible, and do good for those less fortunate. After having been homeless myself, I understand how it is to be down on your luck, no matter how good you are, or how hard you work &amp; try. I am not stupid by any means...I have a BA in Social Sciences w/ a double major (one in Social &amp; Criminal Justice &amp; one in Child Development), an MBA &amp; I am a member of the Golden Key International Honor Society. But I've had 34 surgeries in the past 11 1/2 years &amp; I was in a car accident almost 4 years ago which caused me to have a broken back in two places, so I am unable to work. My medical has went steadily downhill for the past 10 years, but just recently it has taken an even worse turn. My kids are my life....ALL of my kids. Even though I love you both with all of my heart, I am not going to sit by anxiously waiting for you to realize that I care, and for you to actually care about me. I will never stop loving you, but I am going to stop trying to force a relationship with you when you obviously don't want one with me. I have so much on my plate as it is dealing with my medical &amp; dealing with my own body trying to kill me. I don't have the emotional energy for much else. If you ever do decide you want to get to know me &amp; you want to be in my life &amp; have me in yours, I'll be here and gladly welcome that day...But I am not going to hold my breath. If you ever even wanted to come up &amp; visit, you would be more than welcome. Until that day, I will always love you both &amp; wish you the best that life has to offer, I just hope &amp; pray that I live to see that day.\" \n\nI feel sorry for my brothers for having to be raised by her, and I'm surprised they can still walk after she paddled them on the bottoms of their feet with bamboo. To my brothers, I'm sorry and I love you. I hope you find a way out of her disgusting world.\n\nTLDR; Munchausen mom who made her kids sick on purpose tries to pity us to care with an overly dramatic Facebook private message in a group chat.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

(X-Post)", "author": "Thrwn_QtFarAw4y6237", "self_text": "Hello, this is my second post; I apologize for any formatting issues, and if this was the wrong sub to post this in.\n\nBACKGROUND: My boyfriend and I met at the highschool we attend (in the U.S), and are in the same grade level. Shortly after meeting him, we started dating. We've been dating for about half a year, and we both think we have a great relationship, as we get along, communicate well, and give each other support and motivation, among other things.\n\nInitially, when I met him he was mostly aloof and reserved, and stated his mistrust of me (he was wary as he didn't know my intentions, and he generally mistrusts anyone who isn't his friend) when I wanted to get to know him. Now, I know him as a caring, loving, and protective person who trusts me. He is also an intelligent student with good grades.\n\nSince the beginning of our relationship, he mentioned he hated his parents, especially his mother. He explained he hates her because she lies to him, curses him, and gets angry/upset with him easily.\n\nWhen we're in the car with his mother, I've witnessed her saying this:\n\n* Calling him stupid repeatedly\n* A couple of times, she has stated she hates him\n* She called him a bitch, then she looked at me, smiled/laughed a bit, and apologized to me (I assume she was sorry/embarrassed that I heard that)\n* On the topic of birth dates, his mother asked him when her birthday was and he said he couldn't remember, so she got upset and called him a \"little bitch\" twice\n* She has acted concerned and caring in a couple situations, but when they got home, she screamed at him (she tends to scream in his face quite a bit, and they both know he abhors that)\n\nMy question is, how can I support this person? Should I contact someone? I have already told a parent, but they basically told me to start focusing on myself and detach myself a bit from their problems.\n\nThanks, any advice is appreciated.\n\nTL;DR: Boyfriend seems to have an abusive mother, and I'd like advice in what to do/how can I show my support to him?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

They lived together for over year. The relationship began in the typical fashion. She was love-bombed until that slowly began to change. She had shared with him that she had struggled in past relationships and had cheated on her ex before. Now my sister is a really good person, she was in college at the time and had never gotten a lot of attention from guys. She had low self esteem, I\u2019m not excusing the cheating, but she had issues and was a different person then. She felt like she needed to be honest with her current boyfriend (N)because she wanted to be genuine, open, and really change for the better. \n\n\nHe now used that against her at every turn. Constantly telling her she is a horrible person, she has no morals, values, will never change, just beating her down and holding it over her head in every argument. \n\n\nHe also began criticizing the way she dressed. he told her she wasn\u2019t \u201cgirly enough\u201d and wanted her to dress like the \u201cother girls at the gym\u201d (yoga pants etc.) he wouldn\u2019t go to the games she coached because \u201cno one cares about JV college basketball, it\u2019s not something to be proud of\u201d\n\n\nHe criticized her friends from college/work. saying they don\u2019t \u201cknow the real her\u201d or are \u201cjust as bad as her\u201d. She went out and he would call her an embarrassing drunk blah blah blah. \n\n\nHe criticized our family and tried to convince her that we were the dysfunctional ones and he \u201ctried to bring her into his family to show her what a REAL family looks like\u201d \n\n\nHe began reading her texts/emails/social media. He put a tracker on her phone and would threaten to break up with her over minimal things.\n\n\nThis kind of stuff was constant. He gaslighted, manipulated, and verbally/emotionally abused her for a long time. She didn\u2019t leave because she was now convinced she was a horrible person and this was her fault. She was always trying to please him, to little avail. \n\n\nShe finally left him a couple months ago. Sometimes she still talks to him when she is having a hard time. He pretends that he cares and then uses it against her. Her sense of self is non existent. She can\u2019t make decisions without devalidating and criticizing herself. She finally realizes he is a Narc. But is having trouble accepting that, feeling like she was a fool and still thinking maybe it\u2019s her fault. She is a little all over the place. Cycling through emotions very quickly. \n\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is a long post and I don\u2019t know all the lingo. I guess long story short, how do I help her? What do I say? What can I do? I\u2019m trying the best I can, I know a lot of it will come in time for her. All I want to do is expose him for the Narc A-hole he is. I\u2019m so mad for what he did to my sister. I can\u2019t say anything to him because he will take it out on her. I need help. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

These changes weren't well-received, and as her attempts to Hoover me/put me back in my place (via social bullying, triangulation, gossip, silent treatment, gaslighting, manipulation, guilt-tripping, and blame-shifting) resulted in me grey-rocking until I finally went No Contact. I was sure she had secured new supplies and wouldn't notice me becoming estranged...after all, her judgemental, scolding behaviors and complaints behind my back led me to believe she'd had as much of me as I had of her...\n\nI finally went No Contact after she tried \"punishing\" with passive-aggressive scolding on social media and prolonged silent treatment. When she reached out to say she was \"disappointed\" and had \"hoped\" my little time out would teach me to be a better friend, I just blocked her for good. \n\nIts been about 2 weeks and I hadn't dealt with any crazy-making (thought to myself \"this is great! She's doing well, has a lot to look forward to in the next month, has new friends...maybe I was wrong to suspect she'd react with hostility..\"\n\nWRONG! I got a \"heads-up\" from a mutual friend about her rage-filled social media posts, not naming me but clearly calling me out. She was notorious for vaugebooking (so that, when confronted with \"is that directed at me? Are you upset with me or annoyed? Lets talk about this..\" You'd be met with \"I'm fine\" or \"its my coworker, not you. Don't flatter yourself!\")\n\nSo now I'm gearing up for a wave of gossip and malice...\n\nAnyone dealing with a narc ex-friend smear campaign?

I\u2019m still in a fragile state about all of it. Looking back and seeing the red flags right in my face and turning a blind eye. I still have moments when I have a want to apologize? After all the torment and mental abuse I dealt with I wanted to apologize?!! That just sounds crazy to me now. I told a friend the other day about some of the N tendencies he had with me. Our fights mainly were around the same fight every time. One or two certain topics that would blow out of proportions. One time, we were fighting about miscommunications. This was a big topic that both of us blamed each other for but I was the only one who would acknowledge and apologized for it when I did it. He would always \u201cstand his ground\u201d and say He didn\u2019t nothing wrong. Which he probably didn\u2019t \u201cthink\u201d what he was doing was wrong. In this fight he was very emotional and kept saying he didn\u2019t want to put in anything into the relationship and I was expected to put my all in. That made me really depressed like he didn\u2019t want to put emotion or even try. Why would that make me want to try?! \n\nNext fight months later. I ask about a lot of women that are always on his social media. Women I\u2019ve always questioned and felt insecure about. He only gets angry when I bring it up. Asks why I can\u2019t just let my insecurities go and stop bringing it up, even though this is only like the 2nd or 3rd time doing so, and I\u2019d only question when there would be a new woman, or when I found his dating app account that said single. He\u2019d threaten the relationship. Saying \u201c if you\u2019re constantly going to blame me for your insecurities and bring it up that I can\u2019t have women as friends we\u2019re done!\u201d Well for one I never said he couldn\u2019t have women as friends. I\u2019ve seen some of these women flirt with him, he\u2019s does nothing about it. He keeps his social media as \u201csingle\u201d and also on this dating site. Why would a single woman think differently if you don\u2019t tell her what\u2019s up and it says your single? Cause she wouldn\u2019t. \nAt this point I\u2019m just trying to get by. Not talk to him about any of this so we don\u2019t fight. Months goes by with little interaction with each other. Feeling robotic going to his house. \nA month before I ended things we got in a big fight. He said he was the only one putting any effort into the relationship. I quoted what he said months ago in one of our fights \u201cI\u2019m done putting in effort\u201d.  He said he never said that. \nI\u2019m the only one putting in effort. He never messaged me. I have to message him. When I broke up with him and he still acted like everything was my fault. I didn\u2019t just put up with him taking to other women and his ex\u2019s. I didn\u2019t put up with him having a dating account. I didn\u2019t put up with him always telling me it\u2019s my fault and never taking responsibility for his own actions. \n\nI look back now and I\u2019m just astonished at how I pushed the red flags out of my face and continued to let him do this too me.

You can skip past the preamble if you don't want context.\n\nI've been dating my boyfriend for 4 years next month. He is the most loving, incredible man I've ever met, and I know for a fact I want to marry him. We've talked about that sort of thing but he'd like to wait for school to be over before we address that issue, which is fair. In the meantime, he still buys me flowers regularly at 4 years, sends me wake up texts, loves me for who I am while also helping me become better. I'm mentioning all this just so you know what kind of man he is -- dedicated, loyal, loving, devoted. Absolutely perfect for me and endlessly supportive.\n\nHis family is abusive. I've known this from the start. His father does not know we are dating, though the rest of his family does, because he met me once in high school and instantly hated me because I am open about having clinical depression. To this day, though he's never seen me again, he still refers to me as \"that crazy girl.\" I know for a fact this man is emotionally abusive, but I do not know if he has been physically abusive. The fact that my boyfriend will not talk about it is telling, though, as is the fact he's told me once that he would \"wait with the phone in case he had to dial 911\" while his parents would fight as he was growing up. So, based on my knowledge, his paternal relationship is pretty screwed up.\n\nHis sibling relationship is worse. His sister is physically, emotionally, and verbally abusive. She is demanding, entitled, manipulative, hateful... a textbook narcissist now that I've learned what that means from this sub. She is the mother of my boyfriend's nephew who is still in elementary school. She leans on my boyfriend constantly for childcare, to the point that she recently \"moved out\" of their parents house and didn't take the kid with her. But she'll never give up the child, because he's her property and it'd look bad if she did so. He's her key to Facebook likes, after all. I honestly think that's the extent of that relationship, and I've seen the child cry for for literal hours about what a miserable failure he is -- he was 8 years old at the time. It's a mess.\n\n**On to the kicker.**\n\nA few weeks ago, I tried to help my boyfriend set a simple boundary with his sister. Long story short, she got hugely aggressive about it, and ultimately used my boyfriend's mother (classic enabler) to undermine the entire process. Then, she showed up at the house and absolutely flipped. In her tirade, she kicked the family's new dog (she literally killed the last one by snapping its spine) and got up in my face to the point I was about ready to provoke assault just to get her in trouble with the cops. She was that violently threatening. But the killer is that she used my relationship with my boyfriend as a bludgeon to hurt him with. She threatened him with telling their abusive father about me, told him he was a pussy and a coward for not telling the dad himself, etc etc. I was livid. I still am. That she'd twist my love for my boyfriend into a tool to hurt him is abhorrent. But, in addition to that, she was also physically threatening and abusive in a way that I had known about previously but never experienced firsthand.\n\nMy boyfriend has a full-time job with benefits, a car, etc. And yet, he still lives at home. (I also live at home due to being a full time student at the moment) He is applying for high-level schooling and says to me that he will look for a way to move out by JUNE. LOOK for. Not actually move out. I am stricken by the level of abuse he is enduring and that it is so tolerable and normalized in his mind. But, simultaneously, I know I can't swoop in and save him like Superman. I can't force him to make choices. He is a chronic people pleaser, terrified of rocking the boat and getting himself into trouble. It's taken a long time for him to learn how to say \"no\" at all. He naturally, habitually, defensively falls into what [r/raisedbynarcissists](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists)calls \"grey rocking\" without ever having heard of the method. I'm afraid that the longer he stays there the less he's ever going to be able to extricate himself from his family's claws.\n\nSo my question is... How can I be effectively supportive during all this? I've decided to start by reading The Disease to Please by Harriet Braiker, as I see that being recommended a lot... at the very least I want to understand his struggle better. I've been reading a lot about narcissistic abuse and methods for coping with it as well as the thought process of the abusers. I have requested that he see a counselor once the insurance from his new job kicks in, as he's just transferred positions. I don't really know what to do besides these things though. My own friends tell me that I should just try to support him the best I can, but I don't know what that looks like when he's not actively moving towards a solution. I am a very goal-oriented problem-solving type person so it's hard to make sense of in my mind. So, what do you all recommend I do to support him through this? I want him to be out of there, though I know that won't \"end\" the situation. But it would help, right? Either way, I don't have solutions that he seems to want to urgently pursue, and that scares me a lot. I want him to be safe above everything else, and because I know he keeps his cards close to his chest in many instances (due to a lifetime of abuse) I cannot always trust that he is being forthright about his home life or its severity. I am afraid for him but I want to support him in his decisions and in his safety, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how to do so in an effective, loving manner, and in a way that doesn't impose my own desires (him getting the hell OUT) over what he wants to do.\n\nThanks for any advice I may receive. And thank you for reading.\n\n**TL;DR**  \n**Boyfriend living in an abusive household but not urgent about moving out.

However, I never really realized I might have ptsd until starting my new job, where I talk to people about their disabilities and ask about how they affect their life. This made me start questioning myself and now I\u2019m wondering if some things might be related to past trauma I hadn\u2019t thought about before.\n\nI know I was emotionally and psychologically abused by my mother as a child. She manipulated me into hating my bio father. She gaslit me and made me doubt myself because I have autism. She antagonized me when I had anxiety attacks and generally made me feel like I was never good enough. I occasionally get nightmares about this sort of abuse and have learned to recognize and cope with it, though I will be working through it more with my new therapist once I get one.\n\nWhat is starting to concern me is my sexuality. I have gender dysphoria, and have recently started testosterone. Being more my true self has let me explore my sexuality, and having a new partner who is very open to exploring has made me realize some possibly concerning things.\n\nI never have sexual dreams. Never so much as a kiss or a partially naked person appears in my dreams in a sexual context.\n\nI can count on one hand how many sexual dreams I have had in my life, and two where nightmares. The nightmares were complete fantasy, and I am certain something like that never happened, but it was so vivid and so painful, I could actually feel it in an unconscious state. I woke up feeling sick to my stomach.\n\nThese sorts of dreams are extremely rare, but the fact that I had them at all, and such a strong reaction to them makes me worried that it may be related to something traumatic more than just not being in control of my body,\nand having others hurt me in a way where I couldn\u2019t escape.\n\nThe other sexual dreams I have are so \u201cmeh\u201d that, had they not been so rare, I wouldn\u2019t notice them. I had a dream the other day where I was with another person receiving stimulation from them. I could see we were naked and could feel them touching me. It was vivid, and in the context of the dream, this was a person I was attracted to. I didn\u2019t really want it, but I didn\u2019t really hate it either. It was just...meh. Whatever. \n\nThe dream later continued with the same person and another pursuing me romantically, and that was much more satisfying for me. Even dreams like that are rare, where someone desires my affection, and genuinely pursued me instead of I them. \n\nI question my sexual desires as well. I think I am some sort of demi/pansexual. Most of my attraction is purely emotional and romantic with a person who has a good character. I have body types I prefer, but it\u2019s the personality that attracts me. I can have sex, and actively seek to please my partners. But as far as my own pleasure, I simply don\u2019t enjoy sexually pleasuring myself outside of masturbation in private. It just isn\u2019t the same. Even if I am totally in control of my pleasure with another person, it just doesn\u2019t do it for me.\n\nThis is where things get messy for me. I\u2019ve always been an oddly sexual child, before I understood what it meant. I gave \u201cbedroom eyes\u201d and tried to look \u201csexy\u201d, not cute, in photos, even family photos. I remember posing for a Xmas photo for family and licking a candy cane in a sexual manner. My mother told me to just lick it normally. I didn\u2019t understand what I had done until much later in life. I had to be about 15 at the time. I don\u2019t know why I did it, I just know that I did.\n\nI gave my half brother a very noticeable hickey, and sucked on his neck, and he did the same with me, although I didn\u2019t have the marks to prove it. Our dad caught us, and told us not to play like that any more. I initiated it. His mark was so obvious his mom made a joke about it, and we as a family agreed to never speak of it again.\n\nI didn\u2019t grow up with my half brother, I didn\u2019t live with or see him outside of weekend visits to my dad\u2019s house, where he lived, so I didn\u2019t grow up thinking of him as my brother the way others who grew up with siblings do. But I still knew it was wrong. And I kind of knew it was sexual, but we never kissed on the lips or did anything else. I just knew it felt good to suck on his neck, and it felt good when he sucked on mine. But it was me who initiated it. And that concerns me.\n\nI have autism, so I\u2019m always a little behind with the social norm of when people experience things, and I\u2019m especially a late bloomer when it came to actually having sex. I was so afraid to loose my virginity I actually had an anxiety attack. Thankfully I was able to try again with the same person later and became very comfortable very quickly. But I have always been eager to please others, especially when it comes to sexual acts.\n\nI like to give, not receive. And this has left me frustrated in the bedroom. I just keep waiting for it to start to feel as good as it does when I masturbate, and it never does. Maybe my partners just aren\u2019t patient enough to get me there, maybe I just don\u2019t like it that much. But pretty much everything, from penetration to external stimulation does nothing for me. I just don\u2019t have any sensitivity.\n\nI don\u2019t know if it my gender dysphoria, my autism, an interesting form of asexualilty or demisexuality, or some sort ptsd that is shaping my feelings about sex and my sexuality. I\u2019m so confused and lost I don\u2019t know what to discuss with my therapist or how. This is the one thing I can\u2019t fully explain about myself. I can\u2019t think of an episode that would have triggered me to be like this. I don\u2019t seem to have any triggers either. These things just sort of happen at random.\n\nSo with all that out on the table, what do you all think? How should I discuss this with my therapist? What can I expect going into a session to deal with this? Any similar thoughts you\u2019ve had or experiences?\n\nAny insight helps. Thanks.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I made every effort to tell him I was always there to talk and if something bothered him to tell me right away.\n\nAny time I would push the line I would ALWAYS ask \u201cAre you SURE you\u2019re okay with this? Are you POSITIVE you\u2019re okay with this? If at any time you\u2019re not, firmly tell me to stop.\u201d He never would, and I would continue with what we were doing, wether it be something playful like tickling or something more intimate.\n\nWell, as we were breaking up, he finally blew up and accused me of some things. He told me I wasn\u2019t supportive of him when he was going through a rough emotional time, especially being off his meds. I had no idea he was even having issues, because he never said he was, and he never said he ran out of meds. Of course I would have helped him. Had I known. I know how awful it is to go through withdrawals and he knew I knew that. Yet he never said a word.\n\nHe accused me of making him buy things for me disguised as thinly veiled gifts for myself.\n\nThis is in reference to a specific event. We went to an adult toy shop together, and with both our funds, we bought adult toys to use together. I contributed $50 to the final bill, somewhere over $100, which included a few toys we were meant to use together, as a couple.\n\nWe agreed there, in the store, we would be okay buying this for the both of us and not just for one of us. He said he was on board and said he would enjoy using the items too.\n\nLater on, he decided never to use them for himself or together as much as I tried to get him to explore it, since he agreed at the store to buy them to try them out. The one that was mainly geared towards me, I tried to get him to use on me, but he always tired out from trying to use it and so I used it for myself most of the time, since he didn\u2019t want to use it with me.\n\nApparently he was not okay with this and accused me of making him buy this item for myself, even though I pitched in $50 towards the purchase of it. If he was truly not okay with spending his money on these things, then why not say no?\n\nBut what really stuck out was him saying I molested him every day after school.\n\nThis came out totally out of left field. We met in college and I would often be home when he came back from classes. I would give him hugs and kisses and tease him with tickles to cheer him up.\n\nPart of this teasing, which I asked if I could do when we met, and reverified again every now and then, would be having permission to touch his lower areas. I would touch his front and back. Things like pats and gentle spanks, rubbing, and if he seemed to enjoy it, not telling me to stop or pushing me away and giving me a clear no, I would go further with the front. I knew going further with the back was a big no-no, but he enjoyed when I initiated stimulation from the front and this would lead to him finishing this act with me in the bedroom or in the space (living room, usually) we started in, him pulling me closer and engaging in the act. If he ever said \u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d or \u201cnot right now,\u201d or ever seemed uncomfortable and showing body language that clearly indicated he was NOT enjoying it or wanted me to stop, I would stop. Hard stop. If I wasn\u2019t sure, I\u2019d ask if I could keep going. If I was given the okay, I would continue. If not, hard stop.\n\nMy ex was truly molested when he was a child and told me about it, so I always knew it be careful and mindful of triggering him, this staying away from his behind areas. He knew the difference between teasing and being forceful. He knew how to tell me know and when he wanted me to stop. So how did I still hurt him? How, through all of this, did I still not recognize his discomfort, if he truly felt he was being violated.\n\nI feel like an absolute horrible person, and every interaction with my new partner I ask every time if I can touch her before I do anything at all. I\u2019m so paranoid that I\u2019ll somehow hurt her, even though she\u2019s assured me every time it\u2019s okay touch her without asking and if she doesn\u2019t want me to touch her then, she\u2019ll tell me to stop.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to say. What did I miss? What did I do wrong? What DIDN\u2019T I do that I could or should have? I want any further actions to be totally clear in consent, so I can make sure nothing like this every happens again. Please, PLEASE give me any advice you can on the situation. Our breakup was nasty but I never expected this. I want to know how to be a better person, and try to anyone for any son I have committed.\n\nAny comments are appreciated. Thank you.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I\u2019m scared enough of how my life is going to change, but somehow they found a way to make my pregnancy about them and what I can do for them.\n\nThen, my friend gets into this text war with me because I wasn\u2019t happy *enough* for something she was excited about. I\u2019m in class and she tried everything she could to make it into a fight, calling me an asshole when I\u2019m saying normal things, telling me I need to calm down and talk about my feelings, she\u2019s concerned for me, acting like I\u2019m being crazy because I\u2019m pregnant, etc. It was so ridiculous that it finally became obvious how often she manipulates and gaslights me to get her way. \n\nBut I figured she was just riled up for whatever reason and tried to take a break for her to cool off. She texted me a couple weeks later, but called me an asshole so I figured she still wasn\u2019t cooled off yet, I waited another week or two then called her to chat. \n\nI got a whole earful about how she was planning on blocking me on social media and how I might be pregnant but she still has feelings, etc. continuing to make this about my pregnancy, never her own actions. I tried to talk to her but she just kept going, clearly just wanted to yell at me, and I said \u201cfine, I agree with your decision,\u201d hung up, and deleted her myself. I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\n\nI\u2019m sad, this was my best friend for like 15 years and I always thought I... idk had what it takes to put up with her shit? I also have this weird feeling of guilt, like I was supposed to prove that I could be the pregnant friend who doesn\u2019t stop talking to her.

I needed a couple of weeks and a lot of distraction to even get to the point of not questioning myself what I might have done wrong, but realizing it was his fault all along. \n\nThis distraction also contains that I\u2019ve been kissing 2 guys/ friends (just kissing nothing more) since we broke up. He knew those because we\u2019ve got to know them together. They were at first flirting with me but immediately stopped when they knew I\u2019m in a relationship but my ex still kept being jealous, especially on one of the two guys...\n\nWhen he broke up over text, telling me that all his feelings have disappeared, I was shattered in 1000 pieces. I felt worthless, not loveable and just empty.. The person that I loved most and who meant the world to me and told me vice versa, was capable of doing such a horrible thing to me even though he knew that this would hurt me more than anything else because I\u2019ve went through it already. \n\nTonight, I\u2019ve been on a party for Goa music, (I also met him the first time on one of those parties) and I didn\u2019t know he was there. Well, how could I he blocked me everywhere. \nWhen our eyes finally met I was filled with so much anger and hatred, and he just stared at me for 1 second, eyes wide open and fled afterwards, knowing that he fucked up.\nAn hour later his friends pushed him to talk to me... he apologized. I guess sincerely. He told me how much I am still to him and that he still loves me and doesn\u2019t want to lose me as a person. After first requesting friendship, he suggested to maybe start all over but really slow because the steps we made before were too big to adapt to them.\nNot wanting to be fed up by guilt I confessed that I\u2019ve been kissing these guys (under drugs) and that it felt bad cause I knew it doesn\u2019t distract me entirely but just helps me for a couple moments to not feel as worthless and despicable as he left me behind. \n\nHe outraged, questioning why I especially did that but when I did he meant he doesn\u2019t get me. He doesn\u2019t want to get me. \u201eThere could have been thousand different ways, to let me know what I\u2019ve done was wrong... slap me, scream at me ...\u201c \nThe thing is, i wanted that but I couldn\u2019t. He wiped me out of his life completely leaving me no choice than just try to move forward. I would have never expected him to ever reach out to me again...

Also I'm in the UK.\n\nWhen I turned 17 and was finally free of being in care and returned back to my parents we basically never got on. Every opportunity I had I would spend at a friend's or boyfriends to get out of my house. As a young adult I also drank. Like a lot. At one point I met a less than savoury character twice my age. Some of my friends hung at his house and it was something to do. \n\nAs my relationship with my parents deteriorated my relationship with said character who we'll call CD was born. He bought me picked me up in his car, bought me cigarettes and booze and let me stay at his house. We eventually started a sexual relationship. At one point my parents told me not to come home in a fit of rage and I ended up living with CD. Over the course of about 6 months (I had basically no contact with my family during this time)  I smoked cigarettes and weed and drank alcohol every single day.\n\n Eventually he cheated on me with another girl the same age as I and I reconciled with  my parents and moved back in with them. At the time I seen nothing wrong with the relationship despite a few people trying to convince me it was wrong especially because he was twice my age. \n\nThere was also an incident where I got kicked out of a party (i was pretty drunk) after we split up and I had no where to go so I asked If I could go to CD's as I didn't know where else to go. CD said that was fine and when I got there he came on to me and despite me not wanting to have sex with him I was too scared to say no In case he threw me out as I literally had no where else to go and it was pretty much a storm outside. He was also a pretty angry guy and could fly off into a rage over nothing. He once threatened a neighbour with a cross bow over soemthing really petty.\n\n I haven't seen him since but he still now years later tries to contact me every now and again which I ignore.\nNow as an adult with a daughter I see so many things wrong with this situation but I'm not sure they really are wrong? I have nightmares about seeing him again from time to time and I avoid certain locations he's known to frequent.

I read as much information as I could find on narcissism and emotional and psychological abuse. I was 100% sure. I was strong and I could do this. \n\nAnd then...he confronted me.

I didn't know where else to go with this, which is why I'm posting here.\n\nSo here it goes. I'm a minor and so I still live with my parents. When I try to open up to them, they just make me feel like an idiot. They act as if how I'm feeling is ridiculous, and they won't apologize even though I'm clearly hurt, but instead act like it's silly for me to be hurt at all.\n\nFor example, the other day I was talking with my family, and we somehow got on the topic of a wedding we went to a while back. I had to have been a middle schooler at the time of the wedding, maybe eighth grade. There was free alcohol, and all the adults were getting really drunk. I'm usually uncomfortable around drunk people due to how my family gets on Christmas, and I was already pretty tense. I don't like big crowds, or parties in general, and I don't like to dance. My parents, fairly drunk at that point, decided it would be a good idea to physically grab me by each of my arms and pull me out of my chair and onto the dance floor. Naturally, being a kid who was powerless in that situation, it was pretty traumatic. I remember I ended up going up to our hotel room and hiding under the desk afterwards. This incident really upset me, even to this day. Yet when it was brought up and I explained all this to my parents, they acted as if it were the most idiotic thing in the world to be upset over. I was told they were \"just trying to show me a good time\" which made me feel dumb for being upset about it in the first place.\n\nI've come to realize my parents do this a lot. I'll tell them that something upsets me, and they'll brush it off or make it seem like I'm being ridiculous for feeling how I feel. I hate being at home between them and my sister (who will get angry at small things; overreact and take that anger out on me by either berating me, destroying my stuff, destroying things I gave to her, or even putting me in physical danger such as the time she threatened me with scissors or the multiple times she drove unsafely while I was in the car; then be mad that *I* don't apologize to *her* for whatever little thing made her mad, which may include breathing too loud, humming, or tapping my foot to work off nervous energy) who they don't usually do much about whenever she does shit to me. I don't like to open up to my family because I know that they'll judge me and make me think it's my fault for feeling like this.\n\nI'm really wondering...does making your kid feel insane for their problems qualify as a form of abuse?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

You certainly wouldn\u2019t do any relationship work to fix us.  Love: I gave you immense love, you rejected me.  That you ever tried to help fix us is a complete lie \u2013 Your actions were what you always do: Blame me for everything and accept no responsibility, or action, to resolve the problem.  I do believe you no longer love me; in fact I question if you ever did - I think I was a meal ticket.  Life: You live a country-club lifestyle: fake boobs and abs, work-out for 4 hours a day, Gym, Run Coach, Hair, Nails, Hormone therapy, a ton of medical visits, Fake body, beautiful vehicle, no responsibilities, friends who (stupidly) are willing to pay for you to come out and play, and held my pay check hostage\u2026 You didn\u2019t earn any of it \u2013 You stole it from me.  That you say you aren\u2019t happy with life is so egregiously offensive I lost my breath when I read it.\n\nI have really thought about our relationship dynamics.  I used to think we were symbiotic, each making the other better.  It turns out you were a parasite and I the unwitting host.  I believe this to be your true nature; you are so self-loathing that the only way to feel better is to tear down and steal from others \u2013 As I think about you, I have come to recognize that this pattern informs your very existence and permeates through you in the form of atrocious character, vanity, belligerence and narcissism.  That\u2019s why you spend so much time trying to change your exterior shell (After all this time, you have added so many fake layers even I wonder what you really look like): it\u2019s to draw in new victims.  In me, you found someone so in love with you that I continued to pour everything: love, emotions, intellect, financials, time, attention, dreams into you.  You systematically stole everything that I am while simultaneously telling me how horrible I was.  You needed someone a little insecure so that it was easier to dig in your tentacles and continue to tear me down to take what you wanted.  You literally asked me to stop doing things for me to become better so that you could add more frivolity to your life; asking me to leave therapy so you could add a run coach and trips.  At the end, financially and emotionally exhausted, but STILL trying to buy your love, you started adding debt for which I am now responsible\u2026 literally having taken everything from me, now you were taking more than I could give\u2026 so that you could feel good enough about your fa\u00e7ade to move on to some other poor soul and begin the process again.\n\nI recognize this for what it is\u2026 I am worth more to you financially if I\u2019m gone: Never working or supporting yourself is what you mean by \u2018work\u2019.  Love is all about you going out and doing whatever you want with whomever you choose; I know this is a primary basis for why you are leaving.  I would not be surprised, at all, to find you have been cheating for a long time; again, you are a narcissist and believe you are entitled to whatever you want \u2013 In a fifty-year-old woman this is defined as desperation.  I have realized the only energy you expended in love was to steal from me.  Life for you is doing exactly what you are already doing: Living in a country club preying on others.  By getting rid of me, and attempting to steal my income along the way, you are boldly ignoring the fact that Work, Love and Life is going to be far, far harder.\n\nYou are truly a despicable human\u2026 I can\u2019t even say you are a person.\n\nI pray I can recover those things you sapped from me for so long.\n\nI feel bad for whomever you prey on next.\n\nI will not be shy about sharing who you are.\n\nI will never forgive you.

My current husband. Some people have asked me and they might have heard a snippet of information but I have never came out and said everything I went through for fear of the unknown....Fear of being told that I should have known better, fear of being told it was my fault, fear of hearing that I was so stupid and dumb for staying, fear of hearing how dumb I was for what I did, etc. I think its time now to end that, my story might help another woman or man. This will be a long one, most of my stories are long ones..... Here we go....\n\nFirst off, I dealt with ten years of child molestation at home and in dealing with this, the second I turned 18 I wanted to leave home. I didn't care how I got away or who I left with, I just wanted to get away. I was working at a factory when I turned 18 and one weekend when I got paid, I decided to go cruising town. For those that don't know what cruising is, you basically drive a certain circle in a town area real slow and that is about it. \n\nI met a guy who at the time I thought was just so awesome. He had the big nice truck and he had a steady job. He acted just as sweet as silk when we dated. We didn't date long because where I wanted to leave home so fast, the timeline was incredibly short. It went like this:\n\nOctober 5, 1996, we met in a parking lot where everyone gathered to cruise town and talk.\n\nOctober 28, 1996, we moved in together.\n\nNovember 13, 1996, we got married.\n\nLadies or Gents, most of you I know will have more sense than I did back when I was 18. However, if you are trying to get away from an abusive home with your parents, don't take my route. I have regretted those decisions ever since I made them. Back to the story.....\n\nEverything was great even after we got married in November. However, the day that his Mom found out we had ran off and gotten married she told me that I had better be happy with him because their family didn't get divorces. At that moment, I felt like I had made a mistake. Thing is, no matter what mistakes I made in this situation I would never go back home. I felt like home was just as bad if not worse than anything I could endure living around these people. Our marriage was never just the two of us trying to make a life for ourselves. His Mother's house was so close to our trailer, I could almost touch it if I opened the front window. His aunt lived so close I could see her eating breakfast in her kitchen sometimes. So you get the idea, I had this family on all sides of me. This family was the most controlling, mind warping bunch of idiots I have ever dealt with in my life.\n\nThings stayed on a decently straight path until I found out I was pregnant in May of 97. Once I found out I was pregnant, he started changing and not for the better. Before he went to work one morning, he asked me if I could call around town and find some cheaper insurance for the truck. He felt like what we were paying was just too expensive. I agreed and did this, it took me about three hours of solid calling but I did find a cheaper place. When he came home from work, I walked up the hill to his Mom's house to eat supper. At this time, I didn't buy groceries for our own home. He felt like it was a waste of money to have food in our own home when I could just walk up the hill and get something from his Mom's. I will go into that more in a second.\n\nWhile we were eating supper, he asked me about the truck insurance. I told him that well it took quite sometime but I had found a place and it would be about 80 bucks cheaper a month. I said, well you will have to take your Mom's name off your insurance and add myself, because we would get a married discount. Apparently, something in that sentence triggered him. After we eat, we walked back down to the trailer and while I was in the kitchen just sweeping the floor all Hell broke loose.\n\n\"Don't you ever talk to me that way in front of my Mom or Dad!\"\n\n\"I didn't say anything. I just told you what you asked about, you wanted me to find cheaper insurance so I did it.\"\n\n\"You embarrassed the Hell out of me, I am not taking Mom off my insurance. She pays my bills when I give her my check on payday. I am not doing it.\"\n\nHe grabbed me by my arms and slammed me into the closet in the kitchen. Our cabinet doors had these round ornate doorknobs that stuck out on the front of the doors. That doorknob hurt so freaking bad, and I was stunned. I was also around 8 weeks pregnant at this time. I begged him not to throw me around because I was pregnant and I didn't want to hurt the baby. I still to this day don't understand what I said that triggered him. He just lost it. I had a bruise in the back of my head for weeks seemed like and a decent bump back there as well.\n\nThis was just one of the many times he would sling me around, he only got brave enough to slap me a couple of times. The sexual abuse was the worst for me and the biggest amount of abuse that I dealt with while living in this pure hell.\n\nOne of the 2 times that he slapped me, he claimed it was an accident and had gotten so mad he just couldn't help it. I did hit him back with a frying pan because I told him you might sling me around or throw me into a wall, but you will NEVER hit me in the face. I should have just kept my mouth shut, it didn't matter. Not only was he abusive, he was one of these people that liked to show off their property. So anytime we ever went out anywhere, I had to make sure that I was dressed to the 9's and face full of makeup. Hair had to be styled because if I left the house looking the least bit casual, he would call me a slob and wouldn't even walk next to me when we were out somewhere. \n\nWhen I went into labor, he wouldn't take me immediately to the hospital. Oh, No, no. He wanted to take a nap first while I was actually in active labor and THEN take me to the hospital. He slept for about thirty minutes and then I called the ER to  basically get a nurse to tell him that we needed to go NOW, not in a hour when he decided to wake up. The nurse on the phone yelled at him telling him to get me up there now or it could get really bad. I didn't have the baby the second he finally got me to the ER. However, the nurses in the delivery room told him that it was extremely dangerous to keep me at home without any supervision while I was in active labor. \n\nWhen we got to the hospital, I had forgotten my slippers in the car. I asked him to go and get them for me, but he wanted to wait until his Mom came in later that morning. My feet were freezing, oh my goodness they were so cold. Why did he not want to go to the car and get my slippers? He wanted to sit and watch TV and eat Life Savers. I told my Mom when she got there and she went and bought me thick socks to wear while I was in the hospital. It was January of 98 when our first child was born and I would soon learn just how controlling he could be and his family.\n\nWhile I was in the hospital, the Dr came in and told us the general basic things that you hear when you have the first child. No sex for six weeks and on the inside I was ecstatic. When the Dr left, he told me, \"Yeah right like I am going to listen to what he says. I am sure you will be fine tonight, won't you?\" I was floored.\n\nThat night, I went to the bathroom and he knocked on the door. \"Are you ready?\" I was trying my best to stall him in any fashion possible. I figured someone would come in wanting to check on me, a nurse or something. \"No, I am trying to use the bathroom.\"\n\nHe told me that it would be fine to do it in the bathroom. He just wanted a blowjob anyways. I was just disgusted. I had just went through 19 hours of labor, had his daughter and all I wanted was rest. Not to mention, to piss in a little bit of peace. I finally got up a little bit of nerve and told him, \"Just please leave me alone. I don't want to even think about anything like that right now. I have stitches and I am tired and sore. The last thing on my mind right now is making sure you feel good.\"\n\nHe got mad and left me in the hospital to go home. I don't know what he did while he was there. I was also scared because I had never been in a hospital by myself. He did come back in a couple hours but he pestered me all night long and made stupid jokes about having sex in the hospital.\n\nWe hadn't been together very long but even this short time, I wanted nothing to do with him in a sexual manner. Wasn't the rape enough for him? I guess not. He constantly asked me about why our sex life isn't good anymore and why didn't I want to have sex anymore? I mean step back and think about it, you moron. You are forcing yourself on the one person that you are supposed to protect and care about, they want NOTHING to do with you. The first night that he forced himself on me, I want to believe that was when I got pregnant with our daughter. I can't remember the exact timeline back then, most of that time before she was born other than a few things was a blur. He also wouldn't hit me in the face because I think he didn't want his family seeing it, he would rather grab me and throw me into the wall or grab my arms and shake me. \n\nI tried one time to tell him No and it was even worse. It was so bad in fact, I thought that I had started my period I was bleeding so much. The rape was him holding me down as much as he could, because I fought like a tiger, however at this time I was on the skinny side and not very strong. I knew no matter how much I challenged him in our marriage, it would result in torture. That is why I would challenge him a little bit basically to see what my boundaries were, but I knew the line that couldn't be crossed. I really tried to turn things around, I would clean the whole house while he was at work and I couldn't fix supper because right after our daughter was born he still wasn't allowing groceries in the house. That didn't come until a while later. \n\nWhen we brought our daughter home, I figured it would be like a normal family. I would take care of her while he was at work and when he came home, he would pitch in. I was wrong. He told his family that I wasn't able to take care of her by myself. They stepped in and before I knew what was going on, was raising our daughter. I tried like Hell to get him to help me take her back home, he didn't care. He just wanted to see her in more of a visitation form. He would walk up the hill to his Mom's and see her for about a hour, and then come back to the trailer. We had a decent sized trailer, not a small one you pulled behind a car. We had plenty of room for her, it wasn't nothing to do with that. I feel like he either didn't want her seeing him whoop the snot out of me or have her hear what he was doing to me in the bedroom OR he was just lazy and didn't want the responsibility of taking care of another person. But I wanted her with me. I got fed up and went to his Mom's, packed all her clothes up and her baby bed, drug them back down the hill to the trailer.\n\nIt wasn't two hours, his sister came down there cursing at me and calling me cruel for taking my own child away from their mother. I told her, I wanted to raise her. It was my job, I had the kid and I wanted to take care of her. I was 20 at this time. They claimed that I was too incompetent to take care of a child, that I could barely take care of myself. I don't know how they came to this conclusion, I felt like I was doing a fine job. They didn't and the fight was over. They won the battle. He stood up for his family and so back up the hill went our daughter. This was heart wrenching, I felt like I had no back up or help at all. I knew that I would never get to raise my daughter the way that I wanted to raise her. She would go through their church, that I was against (not church in general at this time but just those people) and she would call my mother in law, Mom. And she did, and I felt helpless. I felt like there was nothing I could do, I wasn't speaking to my Mom. I had no friends, he seen to that. I wasn't working anywhere, he wouldn't allow it. He wouldn't even let me buy groceries for the house. I did figure out a way around that though. I would go to his Mom and complain about being hungry, she fussed at him a little bit and I started getting thirty dollars a week for food.\n\nI also got chewed out for it, but at least I could eat something. I remember one day, I was so hungry and I just did NOT want to go to his Mom's to eat anything. I proceeded to eat half a bottle of Tum's fruit flavor. Needless to say, I was constipated for awhile.  I didn't want to go to his Mom's every single night to eat, I wanted to cook supper at our trailer. Even though, I was getting slapped around I tried to be normal. I tried my best to make that worthless excuse of a marriage something it never would be, normal.\n\nI wasn't allowed to take my own daughter to her appointments by myself. His Mom \"HAD\" to go with us. Looking back on it now, I think they were afraid if I got away from them I would have ran away. I honestly didn't have the backbone to run anywhere. I was scared that no matter where I went, they would just find me and bring me back. So I dealt with this bunch for seven long years. His sister was one of those people that when she spoke, she wanted you to listen to her. She felt like because she had taken some nursing classes that she was basically a MD when she honestly was nothing but a receptionist who could give shots. I am not dogging anyone if they do this job, just her. I hated her then and I hate her now. \n\nIn 2000, my husband's uncle passed away from cancer. When we came home from the funeral, he was depressed and forced himself on me yet again. So in March of that year, I came up pregnant. We did have normal sex,well I say that but there were times when we would go for about six months without it and when I say that, I mean sex that you \"WANT\" to have and not \"forced\" to have but it seemed like at the worst times is when he got the upper hand. He never wanted to just ask for sex, he wanted to take it. I had our second child in December and I was starting to see just how messed up my life actually was at the time. Our son was just like our daughter, raised by his parents. I just wanted my kids with me, everyone in my family that came around couldn't figure out why things were set up the way they were and asked questions. I said, well they just like it up there better. It didn't even seem like my own family cared enough to jump in, so why should I? I know differently now, but back then being under the control of an abusive husband and an even more controlling family on all sides of you........I was scared to even breathe sometimes.\n\nThere were times when my daughter would cry and want to go home with me, I would take her. She would stay a night and then cry to go back to her Meemaw. I fussed enough and told them she needed to call her something else. I didn't like her calling his mother Mom.  We settled on Meemaw. My son, picked this up as well. \n\nThe night that my son came home by the way, it was about -10 degrees outside. One of the coldest winters we had in awhile at that time. We used kerosene heat in the trailer and had one of those big stoves sitting in the living room. It didn't work though because my lazy excuse of a husband wouldn't take five minutes to remove the line off the stove and clean it out. So we had 2 of those rectangle kerosene heaters and let me say one thing, I could see my breath all night long. My son stayed with their \"Meemaw\" of course, even if they were staying with us I wouldn't have had them down there in that cold trailer. I laid on the couch that night because there was no way we could take the heater in the back of the trailer, but I laid there that night in misery. I had just given birth 2 days ago and the cold along with the pain I was in, was just horrible. \n\nThis was also not counting the fact that the night before I was supposed to leave the hospital, my husband decides he doesn't want to stay at the hospital and leaves me alone. All his family leaves, what few in my family are gone and there I am in this big hospital with no one at all in the world. I kept my son in the room with me, but I was so scared, I couldn't stop crying. One of my husband's friends from school came up with his wife to visit and he called my husband to come back up there. He told him, \"She is a mess up here. You need to get back up here now, no I don't care if you have to work in the morning. She needs you up here with her. Her eyes are almost swelled shut from crying and they have already came in the room and asked her if she wants nerve medicine to calm down.\" He hung up with him and said that they would stay as long as they could, but both of them had to work as well. I didn't ask them to stay, it honestly wasn't their place but they did stay until about 1am.  He didn't want to stay up there even though the staff at the hospital offered him the bed next to me in the semi-private room, he said that he \"had\" to go home because he had to work in the morning and couldn't miss work. I was never so upset in all of my life when he left that night. \n\nHow messed up is it that a person who abuses you, you still want them to be around you? I can't explain it, never been able to honestly. \n\nIn 2001, the dark skies finally opened up and I met my first friend who is now my current husband. He started coming down a few nights during the week to watch movies or eat pizza, fun things that I wasn't used to doing at the time.  I will call my husband who at this time was just a friend, A.\n\nA was friends with my husband because they went to school together. They weren't best friends in school because A always felt like my husband had some weird qualities about him but they were friends. I finally had someone else that might see what was going on at the time but my husband would never do anything to me infront of anyone else. I was also so afraid to tell anyone what was going on during these times for fear of something really bad happening. However, I figured I would act differently because maybe if he snapped in front of someone else then I would finally have help in getting away from my husband. A would sit and listen to anything I had to say, there was one time that he stayed the night with us. I would sit in the living room with A and we talked all night long. I honestly believe the night that I fell for A, was the very first night that we sat together talking all night. I felt safe around him, he was respectful and he actually cared about my feelings. I didn't tell him that night what I was going through with the abuse, but I did tell him about how controlling this family and my husband were at the time. He told me, you need to realize that you are being used and molded into the person \"THEY\" want you to be, not the person \"YOU\" should want to be. Those words stuck with me that night. The next morning when my husband left for work, A was asleep on the couch. My husband walked up to his Mom's and I was in the living room on the computer. This was when PC's and the Internet was starting to take off and I loved window shopping online. It wasn't ten minutes before my husband came back to the trailer and told me that A would have to leave right now. I said, he is asleep and I am not disturbing him. He looked at me and said, No my family said that it looks funny for him to be here without me here.\n\nI didn't understand it. We were just friends, nothing had EVER happened. Hell, he hadn't been coming down that long. This was the only night that he stayed with us and the only reason he stayed was because by the time we got finished watching movies, it was really late. I just didn't feel safe with him travelling back home at such a late hour, not to mention I needed someone to talk to. He woke A up and told him, you have to go home and I don't think you should come down here anymore.\n\n I was floored. \n\nMy husband had yet again gotten what he wanted, the only friend I had in the world out of my life. I immediately started crying. A said if that is how you feel, I will leave. I cried and screamed when he walked out the door, begging my husband not to do this that there wasn't anything going on but he said it just looked better if he wasn't down there when I was alone. That family wanted me to not have any type of friends, family or honestly any kind of life away from them.\n\nAfter A left, my husband was starting to walk out the door for work and I said something to him that once I said it, I stuck to it. \" I will make you sorry for taking the only friend I had away from me. You will pay dearly for doing this to me.\" He laughed at me and walked out the door. From here on out, I only talked to A online through Yahoo Messenger. I had to sneak and do it as well. We talked online for 2 years, sometimes I would get caught talking to him and get smacked around. I say smacked around, but what I guess I mean is slung or thrown around.  Honestly at this point, I feel like I was getting numb to it. I never got numb to the rape. The rape was more scarce and happened about twice a month maybe three times and every time that I got caught talking to A, he threatened me with it. It took 2 years for A to walk back into my life, but I will get to that in a bit.\n\nIt wasn't long after this happened that my husband got the bright idea that our sex life wasn't enough for him and he felt that we should start opening up to the idea of having other people come into the mix. I was NOT having this, I begged and pleaded with him because I knew this was not healthy. I do understand that in some marriages, this might be fine with people but it just wasn't right for me. He would not let up on the idea and starting posting on swinger's websites. I was just embarrassed with the idea of doing this because it just felt like not only was he using me, he wanted to set and watch someone else use me as well. We met a couple who was really nice, I liked the wife and we got along really well. Nothing ever happened, me and the other wife spoke about it and we felt that we had a really good friendship going and didn't want to screw that up. Well, her husband agreed but my husband had a fit. We had been at their house when this topic came up and when my husband heard that nothing would ever happen, he immediately wanted us to leave that night. We never went back to their house. He decided to change tactics in \"changing our sex lives.\"\n\nInstead of bringing in couples, he messaged A's cousin who was another school friend. He started talking to this guy, lets call him G. G and my husband talked about A like he was nothing but shit. It upset me and they knew it. G and my husband seemed to plot together and try to upset me as much as possible when the topic of A came up. They would set and tell me things like, \" You don't need to be around A, his family is dangerous. They are nothing but drug dealers and you will wind up getting shot and we only care about \"your safety.\" I knew this was BS. I also knew that my time with my husband was coming to a close, but being controlled in this mess for almost seven years I was scared to death in how to go about walking away from him. It has always been strange to me how even though I knew how bad I was being treated, I was scared of just walking away from him. I have never understood that, I guess it is just being used to a certain situation and the idea of something different just scared me? I really can't explain it. \n\nA called me early one morning and asked if he could come and visit me. We had been talking online and finally told each other how we felt about one another. He was so scared because he felt where I was still married even though I was miserable, it wasn't right. He wasn't raised that way to be disrespectful to another couple's marriage. Anyways, I told him I would love to see him. At this time even though my husband had forbid him to come visit me, I was tired of it. I was starting to grow a backbone but oh how it was still a very small backbone. When he walked in the door that day, the last time that I had seen him had been almost 2 years. He was the best looking thing I had seen in ages, I missed those brown eyes so much. He had grown a beard, full beard and I was just swooning. I knew at this point, love had finally hit me and I wouldn't ever go back from feeling this way again. He didn't even say Hello, he just walked in, kissed me and I just melted in his arms. We talked about everything that had been going on, I told him finally about the rape and the abuse. He said that I needed to get away from everything and if I wanted to leave, all I had to do was say the word. FINALLY, I seen my way out. I loved A with all of my heart, and this was my way to get away from my husband for good. I knew that A would keep my husband away and not let him get inside my head. I just knew it. I told him, Yes I want to leave here. I can't stand it anymore. I got a few things packed up and I snuck up the hill. I told him to go out the road and turn around and pick me up where I could slip in the car and not be seen. I knew if his family seen me get in that car, they would immediately call my husband home and my plan to get away would be blown to bits.\n\nI also knew that if my husband got home before I could get away, I would be lucky if I seen daylight again. I was scared, crying and shaking the whole time but I felt like I had done something wonderful finally. A took me to his place and at the time he was living with his Mom but moving into his own place. His room was semi-empty but there sat the computer where we would talk for hours on end. The speakers that during one conversation when he told me that he had them, I thought he was just joking and he sent me a picture of them. I still have that picture. I wanted those speakers so much, I was somewhat a computer/tech/electronics nerd. I still am. About the time that my husband would have gotten home, the phone rang at A's. I knew immediately who it was and I told A, \"I don't want to talk to him anymore.\"\n\nA: \"You need to at least tell him that it's over. I meant I don't care much for him but at least end the relationship if that is what you want to do. \"\n\nEven though A wanted me there with him more than anything in the world, he knew that if I wanted for some reason to go  back he would let it. A wanted ME to be happy. He didn't want me to go back there, but he wanted me to make my own decisions for once in my life. I took the phone and just said, \" I am done, I am not coming back to you. Bye.\"\n\nMy husband started stuttering and said, \"Please let me come and talk to you about this, what have I done that made you leave?\"\n\nI just said, \"Really? You want to know what you have done? You know exactly what you have done to me. I am through, \n\nthis is finally over.\"\n\nHe begged me to  at least have one last conversation and even though I knew better, I finally said Okay. Believe me, I have regretted saying yes to him that day for 16 years. I should have NEVER agreed to him coming over there that night but something told me, let him say his peace. I was so stupid and foolish.\n\nWhen he got there, I walked to the driver side window and said, \"Okay, what do you want to say?\"\n\nHe said, \"Let's go for a ride and talk. I don't want to talk here. I will bring you right back if you want to come back, if you don't then we can come back and tell him and then go home.\"\n\nI told him, \" I am not going back with you. There is NOTHING you can say to change my mind. NOTHING.\"\n\nBoy, was I wrong. He drove a couple of miles down the road and parked the car. He then proceeded to cry and beg for forgiveness. He said that I couldn't leave him because he would be lost without me. The kids would be lost without me. How can I leave the kids and him behind? I honestly started feeling bad for him. I don't know why, I still don't know why. But for some reason when he said that he would change, and that I couldn't leave the kids without a mother, something got me. It honestly makes me sick to type this out, I to this very day apologize to my husband for what happened that night. I let him get inside my head again even after I swore that I wouldn't do it. I honestly apologized to A the other night for me going back after I had finally left him. \n\nIt took six months before I got up the courage to leave him. Six long, horrendous months. I was so scared because now he was even more controlling, watching every step I made, but there was one time he couldn't watch me. His family did, but I think at this time they knew I was done with their BS and didn't say much to him or me for that matter. He couldn't watch me when he was at work. A started coming back down there again, telling me that I was insane for coming back to the mess. I knew it but I was still so scared. I had realized that I was under so much control that I couldn't even make my own choices. I felt like there was nothing I could do but just stay in this Hell I had created for myself. I came back to it, I deserved to live in it. I got my husband to move us from under his Mom's nose to town because for one I just wanted to get off that hill and away from all of his family. I still loved A dearly, I honestly should have just stayed that night when I originally left with him. You have no idea how much I beat myself up for that throughout the years. A has never once made me feel bad over that night, he understands that I was under a control more powerful than I knew how to handle and he knew I would eventually walk away from the Hell forever.\n\nI did too. June 1st 2003, I walked away for good. I got up that morning at 9am and did my normal morning routine. I went in the living room, turned the PC and the TV on and got my Pepsi for the morning. I will never forget what I was doing either. I was sitting there window shopping on CompUSA's website for PC parts (forever a geek) and it just hit me like a brick wall. I looked around the room at everything and realized I don't belong here. I looked over in the corner at the curio cabinet with my husband's Nascar collection that I wanted to burn slowly in a massive fire. His precious cars made me sick to my stomach. I said to myself, \"What am I doing here?\" I immediately went back to the bedroom and he was fixing to wake up and I was just standing over top of him like a statue. \n\nHe focused on me and I just laid it all out in one sentence. \n\n\"I don't love you, I haven't loved you in years and I am leaving.\"\n\nHe stutters and wakes up, tells me to wait just a second as I leave the room to go call A to come get me. I make it to the phone and almost had the number dialed before he jerked the phone out of my hands. \n\n\"Let's talk about this, I thought things were finally back to normal around here.\"\n\nI told him, \"Normal? Normal? You want to talk about normal. How normal was it the other night when A came up here to visit and you stripped my clothes off in front of him and asked him to have sex with me while you watched? Then once he said No, you tell me that he surely can't love me because if he did he would have done it right there? Then what proceeded after he left that night is far from normal. \"\n\nAfter A left that night, because even after I came back to my husband at the time A would still come and visit me when he could visit me. My husband took it out on me because A didn't agree to what my husband asked of him. I knew that night, things would never be normal ever again. This was going to be my life if I never got away from him no matter how much I kissed his ass or challenged him. I sat there and listened to him go over basically the past seven years in about four hours. The reason it took so long for A to come and get me, he was at work when I finally got the phone back and called him. I called his house, got nothing so I called his work and told him I needed him to come and get me. He said he would be there right at 6pm. So the rest of the day I sat and listened while I packed my stuff up of course, how bad a mother I was being even though we didn't even have our kids with us and how bad a person I was in general. \n\nI was never so anxious for 6pm to get there in all my life. Literally the second the clock flipped over to 6pm, I heard A's car pull in the driveway. I heard him come up the stairs because at this time we were in the apartment now up town. He knocked on the door and there I stood, bags in hand and passing him everything I had packed up. He was grinning from ear to ear. The second I stepped across the threshold out of that apartment, my husband hollered, \"Please, don't leave me.\" I slammed the door and I have NEVER looked back. \n\nHas this 16 years been just peaches and cream? No. Has this 16 years since I left my ex-husband been completely free of troubles? No. Has this 16 years been free of rape and abuse? YES! We have had some hard times, but never once have I ever wondered about him hitting me or cheating on me, and honestly I have NEVER wondered if he really loves me. I KNOW he does! I know one hundred million percent that he does, he knows that I would walk through Hell for him because I did walk through it for him. Yes, I put myself in the mess I was in because I chose to run away from home and pick the first guy I found instead of being smart. I was dumb and young. I also didn't have a parent to teach me any better either, not that I blame it on my Mom entirely. There has been times when I have wanted to strangle A, I am sure there has been times he has wanted to strangle me. We can't get enough of each other. We have NEVER been apart more than 1 night since we moved in together back all those years ago. We got married on October 22, 2010 and nothing really changed, just my last name. We love each other now just as much as we did the day I walked into his apartment for good. \n\nHe said it was so amazing those first few nights because he said it was like watching a caged bird being set free. A has always said that even though I am still like a child at times, I have grown quite a bit from those days all those years ago. I told him the first night we were together, it would be hard. I have issues and I knew some of those issues would be a challenge to deal with at times. He said he was ready for whatever challenge lay in front of us. There were nights I would wake up screaming that someone was taking me away from A. Even after 16 years together, I still have those nightmares. They are basically that I can't get to him, or something is keeping us from being together and they are awful nightmares. I usually wake up sweaty and screaming my head off. I also have really bad troubles with sleepwalking now too. However, I know that all I need in my life is A, and I wouldn't be able to breathe without him. Everyone that knows us, knows how crazy we are over one another. We are so crazy about each other, we work together and sit together at work. We would rather be with each other than hang out with anyone else honestly. I mean we do have friends, but our friends just don't understand how a married couple can be so close to one another. Once I walked away from the mess and into A's arms for good, I wasn't letting go no matter how hard someone tries to pull me away. \n\nDid my ex-husband ever bother us? Yes, he did a little. Once he seen that all his control was gone and I was happy where I was and that I was never coming back to him, he left us alone. \n\nDid my ex-husband ever remarry? Yes, a woman that is the same age as my Mom. Apparently, he doesn't treat her like he treated me. I guess my ex-husband knew that he could control every move I made because I was so naive and young. \n\nThis is my story, it has been shortened a little due to me not wanting to go into every detail of the abuse. I am forever scarred because of those seven years. I don't mind to answer any questions if anyone has any and I know its not the most exciting of stories, but it does feel good to tell it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "abuse"}

She has since started dating my younger sister (for 4 months secretly at first).\n\nWhile we were friends it was always a toss-up to whether or not we were arguing at the time. Some of the arguments were over really dumb things that blew up.\n\nExample 1: I got into the college I wanted to, and instead of congratulating me on getting in when I told them, they just said \"oh, nice\" and moved on. After confronting them, I found out it was because I was \"lazy\" about applying because I only applied to that school, and \"everyone knew I was going to get in anyway.\" It blew up into them asking what I had done since I met them that deserved any kind of congratulations, thereby belittling anything I had done for a couple years.\n\nExample 2: We stopped talking for months right around prom time. Why? Because I bought a prom dress that was the same color as the one she was going to wear, though a completely different style. She only started talking to me again when she broke up with her girlfriend and another friend stopped sitting by her at lunch.\n\nExample 3: She was rude to and insulted my boyfriend. On my birthday. Because she felt like I was spending a lot of time with him.\n\nExample 4: When we were in groups of friends, she would actively ignore me. Like, it'd be us and one other person having a conversation and she would have her back to me the whole time and face the other person, and only address them and try to keep me out of it as much as possible, even when the other person made a point to look over her shoulder at me and address me. This happened multiple times, but some were a lot more glaring than others. She would deny it happened afterwards.\n\nExample 5: We stopped talking when I came down with mono. The couple weeks before I got sick were some of the busiest weeks of the semester for me (I was taking 20 credits, working 2 jobs, and volunteering), and so my social time was very limited. Everything blew up when I asked her how she was, she said \"fine,\" and I pressed further. She ranted about how I was never there for her and was always with my boyfriend (we had recently started dating and were in the \"getting to know each other better\" stage still), and that I should be placing her in equal or higher priority than my significant other. This, despite me going and picking her up in the middle of the night because she was highly un-sober on a date with a co-worker when I had a 4am research shift that morning, speeding over to her house and to a park near by when I thought she was going to hurt herself, and still trying to keep my head above water at school and work. I tell her all this and she says \"well then I guess you just don't have room in your little world for me\" and we stopped being friends.\n\nDoes this sound like the right sub? Am I being overdramatic about some of this? I feel like some of these things have impacted my self esteem overall, and the past year has been trying to build it back up. It doesn't help that I still see her once in a while because she's still dating my sister.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My family went to see her body before she was cremated, and my great aunt picked me up and forced me to touch her body. I remember this extremely vividly. It's my only memory of my great grandmother's face, and my mom noticed a permanent change in me. When I was about 5 years old, an older girl made me touch her genitals, including forcing my finger into her vagina. It really rattled me as a kid. I was always told that something was wrong with me so I figured that maybe I was sick somehow. I googled all forms of cancer to try and see if maybe that was it. Then I started trying to break my bones to try and make something that was tangible to my child brain, something that I could understand what was wrong with me. Sometimes when my dad's abuse got so bad, my mom and I would have to stay at a hotel or I would stay at my grandma's for a few nights, just to keep me safe. Currently my family is going through a huge financial problem and are frantically trying to find a home that we can afford so we aren't homeless.\n\nNow onto the bigger stuff that gave me CPTSD and PTSD.\n\nMy biological father was addicted to meth and left my life very early on. I only have one memory of him, from when I was about 2. He would visit sometimes, but otherwise not allowed in my life. I never saw him again after that. This led to my mom's next partner to adopt me when I was 4. I liked her partner more than I liked my mom at first. He was the dad I never had. I'll call him Dick. He and my mom got married 10 days before I turned 7.\n\nI didn't know this at the time, but Dick was cheating on my mom. When he suspected my mom might have found out about his affair, he completely changed. It turns out he was the Narcissist of all Narcissists. He started to mentally abuse my mom and I. I don't remember much of my childhood now, but I do remember the worst bits.\n\nI couldn't eat until I was full. If I took more food, Dick would take it off my plate and announce how selfish I was, how unhealthy I was. If I packed my lunch for school, he'd go in and repack it out he saw fit. He would weigh and count items going into my lunch bag, take half of my sandwich away. He made sure it was a serving or less. \n\nThis led to me being very underweight when I was younger. I played soccer and basketball, I would go rock climbing with him, and I was often forced to exercise at home. If I dropped food or ate junk food, he would take my plate and throw everything away. If I stepped out of his lines that kept changing, he would try and keep me from doctor appointments or any extra curricular activities I did.\n\nI was given an insane amount of chores, and expected to have exceptional grades. I had to cater everything to how he liked it, and even when I did everything perfectly I would be yelled at and punished. It instilled that I was never going to be good enough, to never talk back and to just take orders, that I didn't matter, and that I had to please anybody and everybody or else bad things would happen to me. These things have stuck to me the most.\n\nWhen I was 7 and 8, we lived in a cul de sac with some older kids. There were 3 brothers and one of their friends. One of the brothers was 6, another about 12, and the third about 14. Their friend was 15 or 16. They would make me watch them pee, touch the 6 year old's penis, they would watch me pee, and eventually that led to them touching my genitals and putting a finger inside of me. This went on for a year before I finally told my mom and we moved away.\n\nDick didn't seem to care at all, and continued to mentally abuse me. I was pulled out of school in 5th grade because I was being bullied, and that's when the abuse got worse. I did school online, and was home 24/7. I had nobody to talk to other than my mom and Dick, and would have to spend hours in my room doing nothing but school work or chores. Then, one of my sisters was born. I had to do even more around the house, and I wasn't allowed to hold her or play with her. We moved a few months later to a house with stairs.\n\nI walked by my crawling sister, making sure I didn't step on her. Dick saw me do this and started yelling at the top of his lungs. I don't remember exactly what he said, just that while he was yelling at me he shoved me and I started falling down the stairs. He grabbed my arm and yanked me back up so hard that my shoulder almost dislocated. A few weeks later he shoved me off a chair, but again grabbed me. He would have let me fall, but my baby sister was sitting right where I would have hit the floor. \n\nThis next part is what makes me still to this day cower and make myself as small as possible whenever I walk by someone; I walked by Dick in a hallway, as far away from him as I could be, but that was still too close. He started screaming about how I was too close to him. Then he walked to the end of the hallway and started running at me. I thought he was going to run past me so I glued myself to the wall trying to get out of the way. Instead he ran right into me, on purpose, to prove a point. My face went into the wall so hard my glasses almost broke and the hinge part cut my face.\n\nI overheard him saying that he wanted to kill me. I made a joke about it at church, and they called my mom to investigate. That's when I learned not to say anything and to always keep quiet when something happened to me. I didn't know that talking about it was wrong, or that anything that was happening to me was wrong. It was my normal, and I was so confused about why I wasn't allowed to talk about it if it wasn't normal. This all happened when I was 8-9 years old.\n\nWhen I was 11, my second sister was born. The same rules applied, I couldn't hold her or play with her. 11 was also the age I learned the word transgender. Something in me clicked, and I told my mom. I got yelled at a lot and Dick suddenly distanced himself. My mom would have me dress up in short shorts and a girly top, and show Dick. I was extremely uncomfortable. The first words I had heard him say to me when he wasn't yelling in weeks was \"you look beautiful like that.\" Nothing physically happened from this, he would just comment that I looked good as a girl whenever my mom had me dress feminine.\n\nAfter a bunch of fighting, I was finally allowed to cut my hair short and dress more masculine. I decided that I wanted to try out a normal school again, and enrolled in a smaller school for 7th grade, when I was 12. My mom told me nobody was allowed to know that I was a boy, and I got bullied a lot whenever I had to use the girl's restroom. I became friends with a girl, let's call her Becca, and a boy, let's call him Christian. I told them both that I was transgender. Becca and I liked each other but she didn't want to date me because I didn't have a penis. Christian was obsessed with Becca, and after repeatedly being rejected by her he moved to me.\n\nI didn't know any better. When Becca dared Christian to kiss me, I tried to say no and fight back but Christian pinned me to a wall and kissed me. I ran away as soon as I could, and felt extremely sick. I couldn't understand why, but I knew better than to tell anybody. Christian escalated things very quickly. It turned into him trying to have sex with me, pushing me into janitor closets to try and rape me, and me fighting him off and running away. \n\nHe told me to send pictures and videos of myself peeing, masturbating, etc or else he'd do even worse to me and then get me in trouble. I tried to scare him off by telling him I'd cut his penis off. That didn't work and I felt like I had no other choice. He sent pictures and videos back. At this point I started to realize that maybe I should tell somebody, so I kept the pictures on my phone. But he scared me from telling anyone for a few months afterwards.\n\nThis was the first time I felt suicidal. I was 12 years old. I remember lying on the cold hard ground outside at recess, looking up into the rain and realizing how little I mattered, and how empty I felt. I remember the exact second when my soul started cracking. That night I attempted suicide for the first time. Since I didn't know how to properly kill myself, I failed at that and a few more attempts. On the first day back at school from winter break, I cracked when he started calling me a bitch for threatening to tell someone. So I told some older girls who were nice to me, and they took me to a teacher and told him what I told them.\n\nThat was the first time I had cried in so long. I completely broke down, shaking and sobbing while the teacher put me in an office and got the principal. I had to tell the principal everything, and then my parents got involved, and so did the police. The principal was Christian's aunt it turns out, and she had covered up him molesting another student in our grade. But she also tried to cover up what happened to me, and for a little while the police blamed me and said that I was the one molesting Christian. More and more evidence came up until finally I wasn't the one in trouble anymore. But deep down, I truly felt that I was to blame for it. My soul was completely shattered by that point, and I attempted suicide again.\n\nI went back to school online. The abuse kept getting worse at home. I was completely isolated from the outside world, except for a wilderness survival camp that I went to on Thursdays that Dick didn't know about since he was at work. I became friends with two people, let's call them Sam and Alexandra. Alexandra committed suicide, and Sam turned out to be a Narcissist as well (which I didn't realize until I was 16 and finally cut ties with them). I had a knife for the wilderness survival camp and learned what cutting was from Alexandra. So at 13, I began cutting.\n\nI had this thing which I now know as dissociating. I would completely go numb and it felt like my soul was leaving my body. I would see everything as if I was looking through a long, foggy tunnel. The only thing that could bring me back was cutting. So until I was 15, I would be cutting every night, as much as I could and everywhere I could keep it hidden. I started going to the wilderness survival camp more often, especially during the summer with Dick's permission. I talked to a friend I met there and she was the first person to say that I needed to call the police on Dick, because what he was doing to me was abuse. I completely dismissed her and told her no, this is normal and she can back off.\n\nBut then my mom finally told me that Dick was abusing me, and she was finally getting a divorce. Her last straw was watching him scream at me about horrible things that I can't even remember at this point. My mom immediately cut in and I went to my grandma's house. When I got back, I learned of the divorce and Dick was forced to move out. At this point, I felt so free. I decided to give a brick and mortar school a chance again, and so I went into my sophomore year at 15 years old. I met an incredible guy who accepted me, and we started dating. I thought that all of the bad things in my life were finally over.\n\nWhen I was 16 years old in my junior year, my mom changed. She pulled me out of school, forced me back to online school and isolated me in the house. She did all of the same things that Dick did, and I got so suicidal and my PTSD came out full force that I started lashing out at my boyfriend the few times we could talk or see each other. He took a break and stopped texting me at all for a week. \n\nI started cutting myself viciously, and attempted suicide because at that point, I was back in the abuse and the only person I had was probably going to break up with me, and it was all my fault. I started to slit my wrist, but I stopped right before it would become fatal and threw my blade across the room. I jumped into a shower and watched the blood washing down the drain. When I got out of the shower, I saw that my boyfriend had texted me and didn't want to break up. He helped me get through to my mom that what she was doing was wrong, and she enrolled me into the high school again. I stopped cutting and started seeing a therapist, who called CPS on my mom. They investigated and nothing happened other than them praising her and telling me that they wouldn't do anything unless she was breaking my bones.\n\nThings got better again. My mom changed, and I wasn't suicidal anymore. I started going through the process to start Testosterone. I turned 17 and as a last hurrah before I would be too old to go back to the wilderness survival camp, I signed up for a road trip one that lasted for 2 weeks. It was right before I started my senior year, and a new job that I got hired at right before I left for the camp.\n\nAt the camp, I became friends with two 14 year olds. They were the second oldest, since I was the oldest one there by far. They were both going into high school. But then history repeated itself. The boy liked the girl, and they were flirting at first but then stopped. The boy got attached to me, and this led to the last three nights of the trip where he raped me repeatedly. I completely shut down. He kept talking to me after the trip, only through text. My brain separated him into two people. The one I was friends with, and the one who raped me. It separated them to the point where I agreed to hang out with the friend, because he wasn't the person who raped me. But something in me kept me from actually going through with it, and I eventually stopped talking to him.\n\nI told my boyfriend about what happened, and it got miscommunicated as me cheating on him. We almost broke up again. He said he didn't believe I was raped. My soul shattered yet again at that point, but this time it made me angry. My boyfriend quickly realized what he said, and we cleared up the miscommunication standing in the freezing rain. He was genuine and explained his thought process to me, and I realized that it was his brain protecting itself in a similar way mine did. We've gotten better since.\n\nI didn't report the rape for so many reasons, and I've already heard enough about why I'm horrible for not reporting it. I have my reasons, end of story. \n\nI've also already heard everything to say about my boyfriend. He is a genuinely amazing person. I've seen him at his best and at his worst, and it's my decision to stay in the relationship. He makes me happy, he is not abusive, I'm safe with him, and we really do love each other.\n\nSo here I am, almost 18 years old and baring myself to a bunch of internet strangers. I've started Testosterone and am seeing a therapist. I've been working at an amazing job and have mostly gotten back on my feet. It hasn't been 6 months since the most recent sexual assault, but I'm doing the best I can do. I haven't cut in over a year now, and my boyfriend and I are almost at 2 1/2 years together and planning on moving in together as soon as we can afford it. I'm looking into getting a service dog for my PTSD as soon as I have the money for it.\n\nTl;Dr: I had an extremely Narcissistic and abusive father. He was abusive from the ages of 7-15 before my mom finally divorced him. During those years, I was sexually assaulted several times. Two years later, and I was sexually assaulted again less than 6 months ago. But I'm as healthy as I can be under the circumstances, and getting the help I need.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He did the mistake but guilt-trips me for the actions outside of our relationship", "author": "AlinaLui", "self_text": "Me (21 f), Him (29 m)\n\nHey fellows,\n\na few weeks ago I\u2019ve been posting the story of my heartbreaking break-up with my N boyfriend... I needed a couple of weeks and a lot of distraction to even get to the point of not questioning myself what I might have done wrong, but realizing it was his fault all along. \n\nThis distraction also contains that I\u2019ve been kissing 2 guys/ friends (just kissing nothing more) since we broke up. He knew those because we\u2019ve got to know them together. They were at first flirting with me but immediately stopped when they knew I\u2019m in a relationship but my ex still kept being jealous, especially on one of the two guys...\n\nWhen he broke up over text, telling me that all his feelings have disappeared, I was shattered in 1000 pieces. I felt worthless, not loveable and just empty.. The person that I loved most and who meant the world to me and told me vice versa, was capable of doing such a horrible thing to me even though he knew that this would hurt me more than anything else because I\u2019ve went through it already. \n\nTonight, I\u2019ve been on a party for Goa music, (I also met him the first time on one of those parties) and I didn\u2019t know he was there. Well, how could I he blocked me everywhere. \nWhen our eyes finally met I was filled with so much anger and hatred, and he just stared at me for 1 second, eyes wide open and fled afterwards, knowing that he fucked up.\nAn hour later his friends pushed him to talk to me... he apologized. I guess sincerely. He told me how much I am still to him and that he still loves me and doesn\u2019t want to lose me as a person. After first requesting friendship, he suggested to maybe start all over but really slow because the steps we made before were too big to adapt to them.\nNot wanting to be fed up by guilt I confessed that I\u2019ve been kissing these guys (under drugs) and that it felt bad cause I knew it doesn\u2019t distract me entirely but just helps me for a couple moments to not feel as worthless and despicable as he left me behind. \n\nHe outraged, questioning why I especially did that but when I did explain he meant he doesn\u2019t get me. He doesn\u2019t want to get me. \u201eThere could have been thousand different ways, to let me know what I\u2019ve done was wrong... slap me, scream at me ...\u201c \nThe thing is, i wanted that but I couldn\u2019t. He wiped me out of his life completely leaving me no choice than just try to move forward. I would have never expected him to ever reach out to me again... I tried to move forward and enjoy life, as far as it\u2019s possible. So I shouldn\u2019t be judged about something what happened after we broke up, right? I just tried to feel valued.. appreciated.. wanted.\n\nI feel bad having done that, but he\u2019s using that against me, distracting from his own bullshit he did and rethinks his idea of giving us another chance.\nI still love him but my friends (all of them) are actually not recommending me to give him another chance. \nThe fact that he\u2019s my big love and he has been honest with me all the time (until break up) and he is so different to anyone I\u2019ve met before, poisons my mind. I would love to make it work, but I\u2019m afraid he will now take advantage of my actions and will hurt me after a while even more than he did first time. Moreover he sets me an ultimatum that if I\u2019m not willing to break up the contact with my two male friends he wouldn\u2019t even talk to me anymore. That\u2019s how disgusted he is of me. \n\nWhat would you suggest me? Is it even worth talking to him when he clearly changes his mind all the time and asks for such big things to sacrifice? Even though he did the mistake that aroused all of my actions, he demands me to make the sacrifices. \nI cant think clear anymore. My head is just a big mess. \n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don't know how I stayed for four and a half years. Everything about being with him dismantled everything I like about myself. I used to pride myself on being a strong and independent person yet I let everyone convince me that I needed to stay with him because I couldn't take care of myself because I was having pseudo seizures and panic attacks from my PTSD. I stopped reading first, then I stopped drawing, then I stopped cooking, and eventually I found myself just staring at walls during my free time not knowing what to do with myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe PTSD wasn't that bad. It was pretty bad for a 6 months or so a couple years ago but I got a lot better and I learned how to take care of myself through my mental illness. I kind of internalized the thought that I wasn't well I wasn't right in the head and he took advantage of it and made me feel like I needed him. I had some shitty behaviors from time to time but I was always working on it and I was always getting better in that aspect.  I taught myself how to stop having seizures through the ground work of CBT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just don't know how I let myself feel dependent on someone. I've always prided myself  on being strong willed and independent. I was that 14 year old kid that  did all my own groceries, I cooked all of my own meals, I did all of the  cleaning in the house and I took care of my mother from time to  time. It was intoxicating to feel cared for and protected because no one  had done that for me since I was eight years old and I didn't know what people do when they take care of others. But he was completely  unwilling to help me see a doctor and get help, he just wanted to  pretend he was taking care of me. And then also complain that he had to treat me like a child while I was doing all of his laundry and cleaning up after him for two hours a day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the end, the only time he would talk to me was when he was ranting about guns which he knew was a topic that made me extremely uncomfortable because of a death in my family. He kept all of my documents (my passport, my birth certificate, my social security card) in a locked room with all of his guns knowing that I refused to go near his guns.  I was waking up at 6 in the morning everyday just so I could make him breakfast, iron his shirt, and fetch him anything he asked for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe broke me, or at least made sure I stayed broken.

He is currently the head teacher for the school. Lets call him \u2018Master T\u2019\n\nBefore him, I only had one \u2018friend\u2019 in high school with Narc tendencies, so I didn\u2019t have much experience.\n\nBut this guy... Have I got things to say. When I first joined the club, Master T was welcoming, but I immediately felt that he was \u2018off\u2019 somehow. I chalked it up to me being silly and not having life experience (I was 15), but hindsight is a bitch.\n\nHe is a respected martial arts teacher and heres a rundown of how he used his narcissism through the years-\n\n-Master T would \u2018show off\u2019 his martial arts skills and was not in any way humble about it.\n\n-He was direct and gave only black and white choices for you to make, Yes Sir or No Sir.\n\n-He was very unpredictable, and when he taught at my location, I was always unsure of my standing there, I wouldn\u2019t be able to \u2018see\u2019 Master T\u2019s personality. Class also finished 20 minutes late because he kept talking...\n\n-Master T would suddenly raise his voice to criticise you in front of the whole class for no apparent reason other than to point out your mistakes.\n\n-Is charismatic but flips emotions in an instant and does it as a \u2018joke\u2019 even though its ridiculously childish.\n\n-Master T was VERY childish when it came to emotions. When he was upset with how a person was performing in a move incorrectly he would get agitated.\n\n-At our school, we have things called gradings, where you basically push yourself to the physical limit to prove you earned your belt that you\u2019re getting. While a good system, Master T pushes it too far and enjoys it too much to the point where he likes to break people if possible.\n\nFor myself personally, the worst incident was when he gave me 5 push-ups (push-ups are a method of making the class listen- was usually good natured and nothing wrong with it) for not HEARING him and I asked him to repeat what he said. I am hard of hearing. \n\nLet me repeat- He gave me a punishment for not hearing him when I asked him to repeat the statement, AND I\u2019m deaf. Huh. \n\nI did the pushups out of habit, but after realising what he said, I was seething with anger. I walked away at that point and that was the last I trained  at that location.\n\nThats not to mention any of the preferential treatment Master T gives to his people hes \u2018chosen\u2019 and sees as useful to train to black belt, while using me and others as supply. Theres also a \u2018training program\u2019 with teens helping kids that you could do, but he was really vague about it and if you could get money from it. He NEVER specified if it was volunteer or paid and we would have to help the kids on certain days. It was a mess and I\u2019ve known people who left over it.\n\nCurrently today, I am at the same martial arts club, but at a different location with a much more understanding instructor. Master T is never involved in the day to day activities here. Current Instructor is nicer and not narcissistic at all.\n\nI also still volunteer with the kids at the better location on Fridays because I genuinely enjoy seeing the kids and expect absolutely nothing from Master T anymore, I purely go for my own satisfaction.\n\nIn summary \u2018Master T\u2019 makes my blood boil, but is a good case study of a narcissistic in the wild. I have absolutely no contact with him at this new location and I plan to keep it that way. If he forces or coerces me to do other things from now on.... well then good bye martial arts club, because his shit really isn\u2019t worth it. \n\nHope this was a good summary, I skimmed over some details but he\u2019s honestly a textbook narcissist and knows how to get his way. He\u2019s interesting to observe, but I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve personally suffered alot, its just that I didn\u2019t have much experience with narcissism to make a decision of what he is.

She is trying to get full custody of our three kids because she claims that my depression (which her affair caused, which is now 100% under control) makes me a danger to the kids.  The divorce has been on-going since Halloween.  Every possible issue is an opportunity for her to claim herself to be the perfect parent and for her to claim me as an asshole.\n\nThis morning, I get a text from my 12 year old daughter asking for the date and time of her upcoming basketball tryouts.   I give a quick guess for March 8... and she responds with \"Can you find out for sure?

Pining for the happy ending I\u2019ve worked day in and day out for. Completely given up my happiness for. Worked so hard lifting someone up that I drove myself into the ground and it never ever was enough. My all wasn\u2019t enough. We here in this group know the feeling and it hurts like hell. There\u2019s no real description that sufficiently describes the pain for me. But as I come to grasp with the reality, I see new perspectives all the time as an outsider looking in on the narc and by reading other peoples similar stories. \n\nToday I realized that not only are they emotionally stunted like a child in the fact that they don\u2019t understand/feel empathy. And that they have issues with object permanence etc. I realize that they are much much more like children than most people typically point out in narc discussions. \n\nYou, me, us the \u201ccaretaker\u201d of our narc essentially must always be on top of them to know the truth, to know what actually happened, to know what is real. For me it was so exhausting to always feel like he\u2019s up to something at all times and just waiting to find out what it was, because like a child, he seemed to keep needing to make mistakes, to learn lessons, but it was like the lesson never stuck with him ever, like he had to learn things were bad over and over except he couldn\u2019t comprehend they were bad obviously or else he wouldn\u2019t do it again.  When children grow up they learn these things, are taught no and yes etc. narcs stay in a state of not being able to grow. They must always be babysat or they\u2019ll misbehave.\n\nWe are responsible for everything that happens and their emotions at all times, all of that weight is put into our hands. We must forget our needs as to always take care of theirs (like a mother having to care for an infant whenever the infant cries). At some point you grow up and start to take care of yourself. Obviously narcs have to do this too, but once they find a caretaker, no matter how old they are themselves, they return to almost an infantile stage. Babies don\u2019t see that their mom is stressed and tired, they don\u2019t care, they are too young to be able to, all they know is feed me help me care for me. It\u2019s not a privilege to be taken care of, it\u2019s an expectation. Much like narcs. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t keeping your eye on them at all times, they\u2019ll be mischievous, they\u2019ll test you, the way a child tests its boundaries to learn right and wrong. \n\nBeing with one = taking care of an adult infant essentially. Except they\u2019ve grown up in this world and learned from observing other people and know how to manipulate in a more subtle manner to get what they want, which is essentially to be loved unconditionally and be seen as the best thing since sliced bread to all who come in their path. \n\nOnce you love them and they don\u2019t need to make you love them anymore, here comes the baby. No care for you, just you caring for them. Always and forever. They will shit on you, throw up on you, keep you up at night, whine (especially when they don\u2019t get their way), throw fits, sneak behind your back, cheat on you with another person as a child would cheat in a game of checkers, blame you for everything that goes wrong bc they\u2019re kids essentially and kids don\u2019t know any better but you the grownup do, envy others in a \u201cthey got more ice cream than me\u201d kind of way, they test your limits and once they find them start breaking them, expect you to wipe their ass but they will NEVER do the same for you ever. Not unless they want your cookie, not unless it\u2019s a simple chore, and really all it took for my nex to get me around his finger was to simply be in a good mood, that gave me hope, because a lot of the time he was just enraged. If all it takes is for him to kiss me a couple times and call me on his lunch break, easy enough, he gets all my love and dedication for a crumb of his. They do the least while you do the most, like a kid getting an allowance except the child is sucking you dry. And all the while you\u2019re starving but the crumbs sustain you enough to not completely crumble into nothingness.\n\nAnd then when you leave, you have abandoned them, never loved them, were never really there for them, acted the whole time, just felt sorry for them... it\u2019s horse shit. \n\nBut when they leave you, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve failed them. Play house with you until they get bored.\n\nBut what else would you expect from a child? \n\nYou are a caretaker and a toy. Nothing else. Always. You are their safety and their supply until they break you and then it\u2019s on to the next. \n\nYou can clearly see why it is believed this disorder stems from childhood. They take out all their hatred for their shitty parent on their partner. \n\nI feel bad for them. But being with one is a whole other story. It\u2019s legit like raising a difficult child over and over and over again. You are just a hamster running on its wheel in a small cage in the world of a narc.\n\nI want my nex to be the facade that he will never actually be. It\u2019s heartbreaking. But this IS the reality of the situation. And there\u2019s nothing I can do about it. It\u2019s time to accept this. \n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He's not an extrovert or flashy but instead is this externally charming and quiet and smart guy with a tragic childhood and all this vulnerability. He's hypersensitive and insecure and passive aggressive, but he's also always right and controlling and belittling and randomly outright emotionally cruel. I think it gives him pleasure and sustenance to cause emotional pain, like he's a bee sipping nectar, and it tastes sweeter if the emotional pain is like a sucker punch when I'm least expecting it.  \n\nThe thing is we're long distance in two different countries so we keep up daily by text and phone and skype to stay connected between visits and it can be very intimate and bonding and involved... but things have deteriorated so much, the cycle is SO tight right now it's like we go through the building tension and explosion and pain and silence every few days, it's constant and I'm in so much pain all the time. I've tried everything to change myself, to shut up, agree with everything he says, never defend myself, always let him have his way, avoid the words he'll jump on, take the blame even when I didn't do anything - nothing helps, there's always another thread to pull. I love him so much, I would have done anything for him, anything. And I feel like I'm being dragged under our relationship like roadkill, like he will only feel good when I'm squashed flat and buzzing with flies. \n\n\nAbout a year ago out of desperation I started to do this thing where I 'go on vacation'. Only I wouldn't actually go anywhere, I'd just tell him I was going on a hiking trip in the mountains with friends, or a work trip to somewhere really remote. Both are things I actually do, but I just add in an additional fabricated hiking trip here and an additional fabricated work trip there. And I delete all my social media apps and take a few days or a week of a break from him, but really I'm just at home and going to work like usual, without all the fights and checking in and misunderstandings and tension and pain. \n\nIt's like when I give him a false vision of my current life I'm protecting the life I'm actually living from his eyes and his mind. When I say I\u2019m hiking and I\u2019m actually at home, my home is protected from him. His mental image of me is three states away in the mountains with a friend, so my real life alone at home, putting up cabinets in my house, watching tv, going for a walk \u2013 all of that is private to me and invisible to him. He can\u2019t touch it. He can\u2019t see it. He can\u2019t pass judgment. He can\u2019t own it. He can\u2019t control it. I feel safe at home for that week. It's like I've build a small secret cabin in the woods i can escape to when I need it and there is so much peace in that little cabin, and coming home (reconnecting with my partner) is very hard at the end of the break.  \n\nAnd this plays out in other ways too, I no longer tell him anything personal or vulnerable about me, no more secrets because there's no trust left. He's used every vulnerability to hurt me and every secret to humiliate and I can't give him any more of that. Sometimes when we're laying in bed and he's whispering to me and asking me intimate questions, to tell him secrets from my childhood, or intimate confessions, I make something up that's not an outright lie, but not quite close enough to the truth so that when he tries to hurt me with it later, it doesn't hurt as badly.  \n\nI realized this last month when we were spending every day together that maybe the reason he hurts me so much is that he senses I'm giving him a decoy version of myself and he doesn't love the decoy. Maybe he hates the fake version of me and knows I'm a liar and a faker and is disgusted with me. \n\nI really want to leave him but I feel so tied to him and so tired. I feel like I will never be normal again for another partner, like I'm a tree that has bent into the opposite shape of a conjoined tree and if I walk away, I'll be twisted into his reflection and will only ever fit someone exactly like him again. \n\nThanks for letting me get this out. \n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I left the house and immediately bought the book and read it in full in 24 hours.  \n\nMy struggle is,  this book really enlightened lots of things for me but since I'm certain he's a narcissist,  it puts so much blame on me for picking him? Yes I understand I made choices to get where I am today.   Many of them based on the low self esteem my childhood nurtured leading me to want to reenact all that crap with him.  So I do feel more enlightened and informed on my own shit. But  I also feel sort of lost now.   It seems like it's all on me to make things better where I'm at,  join Al-anon or CODA and don't worry about what he's doing.  But the things making me crazy and eating my sanity are that we don't have boundaries or respect,  I am carrying the responsibility for everything in our lives and with 2 chronic illnesses (fibro and narcolepsy likely caused by C-PTSD from him) and I am fucking exhausted.  There's nothing about dealing with the real day to day.  I think that is probably due to the time period it was written,  women just accepted the misogynistic misery of them doing everything.  \n\nIs there a book that is informed of her school of thought that can help someone who is with a narcissist? Recommendations? Suggestions or what you found useful if you read this book? Thank you so much for reading and for this thread.  Knowing I'm not alone in my struggles does help.  \n\nA little back story I'm 31f, he's 36M. Together nearly 6 years.  We broke up last summer because he refused to go to couple's counseling.  I tried to leave,  got 90% of my stuff out and he hoovered me back in.  Things were better for a time,  did the couple's counseling.  But we're back where we started except that I express my dissatisfaction more often and less quietly so he has done all that he can to further destroy what's left of my self esteem each time.  Not sure I have the energy or courage to try to leave again.  Wedding scheduled for June and planning seems to have really ramped up the verbal abuse.  Idk why I moved forward with picking a date,  just another dumb decision of mine.  I guess I thought marriage and children might fix some things but the more I think about it the more I want to run.  \n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have been talking to my mom about this but if we\u2019re being honest she acts the same way. I would really appreciate it if somebody helped with my current situation. This is a list of thoughts as I am currently attempting to walk away from the only person there for me. \n\nThis is genuinely a rant of my thoughts and gives me the ability to make some rational decisions of my own. Reading back through this helps me see my picture more clearly and honestly I feel better about making the decision to leave. I would like any and all advice however. \n\nI\u2019m a 23m and my current? Girlfriend is a 21f. Now I would like to be as non biased in this as possible so if I sound like I am making excuses for myself please call me out. I honestly feel a bit embarrassed as to how relaxed my boundaries for a person have become. \n\nCurrently we\u2019ve been dating since around last March. I still remember meeting her and thinking that this was officially the one. Like people don\u2019t get better than this. The illusion soon wore off but I already adored her. In the mornings she would be the most negative person I have ever met, I honestly thought it was just me being there that did this. This lead to the first problem of me blaming myself all of the time. I just felt like I was walking on glass. This has really continued until this day. I must say, there was always this part of me that felt that it wasn\u2019t real, that this was a sham. The more I back away from the relationship the more it makes sense. \n\nCurrent day us has our problems, but there are some particulars that I\u2019ve attributed to being narcissistic after finding this subreddit and reading some helpful articles. \n\nFor one, if there is any sort of problem big or small, I am to blame. I\u2019m not a very confrontational person and when somebody is being irrational I tend to not take it personal. But this is my girlfriend, most of the time I feel completely confused and tend to just swallow the problem and move on. This has attributed to my constant sinking feeling. I have been having trouble just waking up in the morning, it feels as though everything I do Is wrong. I can\u2019t bring this up because she\u2019ll put this right back on me. But then I feel bad, like she doesn\u2019t mean it she just doesn\u2019t know better. Like I\u2019m talking to a child. It is such a strange phenomenon like she is not even consciously there when doing this. \n\nIn all honesty the one thing I wish I could do is just genuinely make her feel loved. I just actually care about this person so much and it\u2019s a real shame to think that she has no way of reciprocating. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is what\u2019s happening currently, I will give you any backstory that might help but I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m looking for here. Maybe that I\u2019m making the right decision??? I\u2019ve struggled with this thought that I am making a bad decision. I have never broken up with somebody before. \n\nI have an old group of buddies who I\u2019ve reconciled with recently. My girlfriend LOVES to drink, it\u2019s her favorite thing to do. This should be red flag enough, but I grew up with alcoholic parents and I want her to see a better path. Moving back to the point, we\u2019ve stopped hanging out as much lately. Honestly I\u2019ve been both stressed with school and working a lot. But being even more honest I just struggle to enjoy being walked on when she\u2019s around like I have this inner resentment that has built from all of the bullshit I\u2019ve been put through. So she really likes going out, I go out sometimes etc. but not every time and that\u2019s fine. \nBut here\u2019s whats happening and where things are starting to click for me. My girlfriend and my buddy have been messaging instead of my buddy and me. While I\u2019ve thought of it as harmless i really don\u2019t think it has been. Now when we go out, we meet up with my friends without me even getting a heads up. This in my opinion already is a bit rude but nothing to break up over. \n\nNext thing you know, last Thursday she tells me shes going out with a couple of friends that I know and don\u2019t mind. I tell her cool. It should be normal. But on the other end of it she has been throwing I love you around a lot more and overall been trying to be more affectionate. I found it surprisingly weird. Anyways so last Thursday I have this gut feeling that says she went out to meet up with my buddy. Note there is a guy that is friends with my buddy that I met once with her, she definitely took to his interest. So given that in mind she posts a picture on Snapchat of this guy with his arm around her. Now I have questioned her truthfulness before but she has always told me she\u2019s trustworthy and I have no proof otherwise. But I have called her out in the past for it and she knows it makes me uncomfortable. So naturally I text her and ask where she is and who she was with. She\u2019s being suspect for the entirety of the night and is not really telling me where she is at. I gave her a bit of attitude and the cold shoulder and told her we needed to talk in the morning. \n\nNow back story on this part. My girlfriend wanted to go to Mexico for a weekend during spring break because of course this buddy of mine put the thought in her head. I told her it made me uncomfortable and stressed that she was trying to go to Mexico with my friend group when these people are known drug users and heavy drinkers. I could not go because of work but I was down for a vacation somewhere else later in the week. She wasn\u2019t having any of it , like most times she just shut down and didn\u2019t talk about it. \n\nSo anyways now we are on Friday. Friday morning comes and I\u2019m still a bit ticked about the night before considering we have had the same conversation about my boundaries a few times. So I text her I\u2019m coming over and she just straight tells me that she\u2019s leaving to Mexico and that she knew it would make me mad. So I am sitting there completely stunned and pissed off. There was no warning or anything, just that she was leaving to do it knowing that i wasn\u2019t comfortable with it. I keep beating myself up thinking that I\u2019m just being overly jealous about this situation. That\u2019s it\u2019s okay she left on a whim. I just don\u2019t know\n\nSo this hurt me, I went full shutdown no contact mode until really yesterday or today. My mom has been helping me through this for what it\u2019s worth and bought me a ticked to come back home for the rest of my break. After not talking I my girlfriend for the entirety of the trip I contacted her yesterday about how I was leaving town for the week. I really had no intention of playing games with this. The thing is she doesn\u2019t even recognize how much it hurt me for her to leave town in the manner she did. She doesn\u2019t even think there was anything wrong with what she did. She came back expecting me to be okay with it and act like everything was fine like I always do. I have just hit my breaking point and I can\u2019t offer sympathy anymore. So this naturally pissed her off. I really am not trying to play games I\u2019m just so fucking sad that I had to be around my family. \n\nAnyways fast forward to today, she\u2019s trying to contact me on snap by asking menial questions that I just naturally reply to. I really feel like this has been a mistake. Mind you she just went ahead and blocked my on any and all social media. I have not even been mad at her since that initial shock of it all. \n\nSo just now she asks why I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing and that if Mexico was such a big deal why I didn\u2019t talk to her about it. \n\nShe really tried her hardest to flip it around on me. But in this time I\u2019ve really given thought to her actions and genuinely decided that they haven\u2019t been respectful and somebody that cares about another person wouldn\u2019t do something like that. So she tells me she\u2019ll just leave me alone because she only causes bad moods and really tries to guilt trip me. \n\nI just have this weird fighting urge that I\u2019m being an asshole over this. Like I\u2019m just overreacting. I have stood my ground so far but damn I just hate being so unsure because she just doesn\u2019t act like she gives a shit about us sometimes and then pins it on me\n\nThanks for listening to the voice in my head for the last page. I\u2019m not even sure it makes sense but now she has I added me on everything and I just don\u2019t know anymore. I don\u2019t get it \n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

The constant sarcasm, the put downs, domineering attitude, and the walking on eggshells. I felt that whatever I said to her, she would interpret it as wrong or offensive. It almost felt as if I couldn\u2019t breathe. Say one word and she has the whole \u2018story\u2019 made up without caring to understand what I mean. I had to be some mind reader. She would often lowkey mock me about the things I missed in life. Instead of helping me and idk enjoying our time together, she would make me feel anxious, you know? If we are out in public, I felt like I was going to have a panic attack. Why? Because everything I did was apparently oblivious and stupid behaviour. I should\u2019ve taken the hint when she said that she enjoyed bullying me. \n\nShe had all manner of negative things to say about me and then claiming it\u2019s the truth. This reminds me of my step-father who belittled me every time I couldn\u2019t understand something. It\u2019s no wonder I feel extremely embarrassed to go to therapy since I feel the therapist will be a someone like my ex and step father. Whenever I said I wanted to be something or someone, she would put me down and say shit like \u201cyou aren\u2019t good with people\u201d, \u201cyou patronise everyone\u201d, and \u201cyou\u2019re lucky to be alive.

Instead of saying how it is, I am the world\u2019s bad guy. Yet she got annoyed that I made her feel bad. She wanted a guy who was the top 20% when she herself is nowhere near that either. \n\nFor someone proclaiming that she rather breakup face to face and for us to remain friends, she did a total 180. Apparently I got on her nerves. She didn\u2019t understand how sex was important to me, yet she faked her orgasms instead of just discontinuing the relationship earlier on. A relationship without sex for me is like living with a friend but you can\u2019t touch them. Idk but that to me is a tad abusive. Withholding affection and all. \n\nSo, am I right to think she is narcissistic? Gosh, this was my final attempt at trying to cultivate a relationship. It\u2019s no wonder I prefer to be alone.

That being said he has left me with a number of triggers that surround me and most people in day to day life but I've been able to avoid them. My dad is very aware of the situation though we haven't talk about it for years. One of these triggers is the smell of cigarettes --especially in the car. My dad quite smoking long before everything happened with my grandfather. But he has started smoking again. I made him aware that it was a huge trigger for me and he agreed not to come near me while he smoked or until he aired out a good bit. And to be completely honest this worked for about a week. Here is where the issue comes in. He smokes in the car. Never around me but anyone who rides in a car with a smoker now how the smell embeds itself into the car. Being in a car with cigarette smoke is terribly hard for me and i have to unroll windows and stick my head out of the window and breathe out of my mouth and i know i sound over dramatic but if i can't smell it, it avoids me being triggered and going into flashbacks or panic attacks. But today it was really cold out-29 degrees to be exact. I tried to unroll the window and you could tell he had just finished smoking right before he picked me up. He got extremely mad that i unrolled the window and my sister and her friend (who are completely unaware of the situation) are sitting in the back. I in return yelled about how horrible it smelt and he said \"i dont f\\*\\*\\*ing care\" and i screamed that it was triggering me--i know i sound over dramatic but i really try to avoid certain triggers at all cost because as im sure all of you know reliving traumatic events is just not a fun time. He let me crack the window a little bit and i held my nose and barely breathed the entire ride. Any advice at all? He drives me everywhere and getting another ride isnt an option.

This means that they rank themselves and everyone else around them, and if the narcissist doesn\u2019t see themselves as being \u201cabove\u201d others, they feel worthless. Likewise, if they do see themselves as being better than others, they feel worthy, like they are winning. \n\nIf you have no sense of your own intrinsic self-worth, worth that is not based on anything external or material, you are going to be desperate to \u201cbeat\u201d the people around you in order to feel like you matter, or even like you exist at all. Being kind and loving towards others is not going to be a priority for you, because that would mean you\u2019d be empowering others, and you wouldn\u2019t want to do that. A narcissist\u2019s problem is that they have no inner sense of self-worth, therefore they engage in behavior that is destructive to other people because the narcissist is literally USING those people to prop up the narcissist\u2019s self esteem. \n\nA narcissist can\u2019t win unless someone else loses.

We have been in agreement that we would list the house and sell so that we could both move on this summer and not be legally tied together through real estate.  \n\nI have now been accepted into a graduate program in Italy, and now that he knows I will have to move, he says it's too inconvenient for him to move now.  Unless I want to give up on an amazing opportunity and continue to subject myself to living with him and his new gf for who knows how much longer, I will need to leave.  I'm really worried that I am going to be screwed over concerning my rights to the house when I do.   \n\nHe's insisted that it's not fair for me to gain equity if I'm not living here and paying into the house(although when I'd considered staying here he viewed it differently).  He also doesn't have the financial means to buy me out of the house and refinance right now.  I also know that he doesn't have the means to pay for the house because his debt to me increases every month because he cannot contribute equally to the mortgage and bills.  His new gf would definitely be the one paying the bills when I move.  She's also got a step-father who's apparently a top lawyer and I'm terrified of being railroaded in this whole situation.  I know I should consult a lawyer, but I'm not really in the best financial position to be retaining one with how much they cost here in the bay area.

I have been in the cycle now for nearly 5 years.. I came to my senses yesterday and asked for divor\\*\\*. The terrible thing about it is that with a narc, you'll have 9 shitty days and then 1 day where they are being so nice to you, before the cycle starts all over again. Yesterday he happened to be nice, (planned on taking me out to dinner for the first time in months) making delivering the news a huge blow up. I was even doubting myself and my delivery of it but the truth was I had so much anxiety, I just blurted it out. You see we had separated about 1 year ago. I was 5 days into a new job, in the new city I had moved to to be with him.  When he told me he didn't want to be together anymore, out of the blue(discarded) . I had about a month to find a place, starting from scratch. I was in auto pilot, my only mode being survival. Learn the new job, find the apartment, furnish it, remember to eat. I go about 6 months limited contact.  A mutual friend passes :( towards the end of this time, and I express my condolences to him (they were much closer).  We get in contact again. He love bombs me, flattering me, takes me out on 2-3 magical dates where even the server is like \"you have a great guy here!\" (always the charmer, am i right?) He says he wants to start hanging out again. I say its me or your so called 'freedom' and he says me. He keeps up the charade for a few weeks, then around christmas- new years starts being distant again. He does find the time to slip me in a nice gift - but then I learned, with narcisissits, it was more for me to think highly of him than it was to actually please me. And it worked.  I thought how kind of him, but why doesn't he text me more. Am I crazy? a couple weeks after new years I write a letter, expressing my thoughts, explicitly asking if he is hooking up with other people. He denies it, says he'll change his behavior, text, more communication.  A few weeks after that I find, in fact he had hooked up with  a married woman. I confront him, he says, I had asked if it was 'people' not a person. Says it was an accident, he was drunk,  wont happen again. I never thought I would be with someone like this. However, I was still in love with him, I forgave him. Only to find weeks later that that wasn't the only girl. Both these times happened before I wrote the letter. The 'person' was in fact people. Of course when I confront him nothing is his fault. It was only meaningless drunk sex.  We were not technically 'back together' and I say, I thought you reached out to work things out? This is not how you go about working things out. Today he texts its for the best, I violated his trust by reading his messages about screwing around, and clearly I dont trust him either. This is where things are at right now, I am scared as he is playing victim now and will get me to apologize for reading his messages, saying he's right we werent back together, and it wasnt technically cheating.   I know I deserve a more steady, loving, less volatile relationship than this, but when we do finally part, I will miss the good in him so much.  I think he will leave me alone after this though, and of course go on to live his happy carefree life. (no kids or property together, hoping the process will be smooth, still relatively young) I want to bounce back from this. I have little amount of friends in this big city, whereas he has a TON +family. Tbh, I am thinking of starting over in a new city after this, hoping it will help my recovery. Denver sounds nice.

He thought I cheated on him, but I don't know when he thought I was doing it because when I wasn't working, I was catering to him. I was always around him. He kept accusing me of ' always looking at people' and all I did was 'look at people.' I didn't get what this meant, but he thought I wanted to have sex with every guy that passed my range of sight. Literally, he would hover and look at my eyes, so if I scrolled down on FB and a guy posted a selfie, he would quickly accuse me of 'looking at guys' and this was proof that *all I did was look at guys*. How was I supposed to know that selfie was gonna pop up? I obviously saw it, so? Or if we watced movies, and a shot involving a crotch or cleavage came up he would again accuse me of 'always looking at it.' I didn't understand at the time because ofcourse I saw it, I was *LOOKING* at the movie. Basically he claimed that I sexualised men everytime I looked at them, and all I thought about was sex. He even said this to others, but this was only one of the many waysthat  he reflected his own behavior on me. While I could not even look at men, he was addicted to porn and I made no problem out of him watching it.\n\nWe were in Vegas and walked the streets at night when I looked down a bit, becasue I noticed that the whole street was covered in, basically, prostitutes buisness cards. As I looked up again, the commercial on one of the enormous screens changed from whatever, to Chipendales (the sexual, male dance group.) Without skipping a beat, he claimes that I only looked up at that moment, to see that comercial. Like I could have had any clue that, that was going to happen. He was even jealous of actors and got angry when he notcied that I was downloading movies, or had been on IMDB (he was spying on the search history.)\n\nOne night I was exhausted, because other then working for 9 hours I had also worked 6 hours in the house cooking, cleaning, doing and hanging laundry. I had decided to relax with a movie before bed. So around 10 ish at night, my Nex finally get off the couch to get ready for work. He would usually leave 10 minutes before, he was anal about being on time and only had a short walk to work. I got ready to watch the movie and was filing my nails in the couch when he started hovering in that strange way that he could do, instead of go to work. He asked what I was doing and I explained  that I was going to file my nails and watch a movie to relax before bed. He eventually gets going to work. I don't think 20 minutes passes before he calls me.\n\n'Hi. What are you doing?' *I get suspisous and slightly annoyed but I remain calm.*\n\n'I am watching a movie, I told you right before you left.'\n\n'Okey, it sounds like voices behind you, is someone there?' *Literally.*\n\n'It's the movie. Who else would be here? It's 10 o'clock at night and I am about to go to bed. I already told you this.'\n\nHe get defensive and talk about how he *just wanted to talk to me*. He end up hanging up on me. Another couple of minutes go by and he calls **again**.\n\n'Hey, I just talked to my sister. She was walking past our building with the dog. She said the balcony door was open and she heard voices in there. Is someone there?' *Now I get really irritated. and start pointing out everything that is illogical with what he is saying.*\n\n'Are you serious? The door is closed, it's night time and cold. How could she have seen my door be open? How did she even call you so quickly inbetween our calls. You know I am watching a movie.'' He hangs up on me again and does not call back. But I found out later that after that, he called my mother (who also was working) just to complain about how lazy I am, and that he has to do everything around the house. Which was **straight up lies.** \n\nAbout a year after I went NC I still didn't understand the depth of the abuse, I was spiraling but didn't understand why I felt so bad. As I scroll on my phone I realised that when a selfie popped up on my feed, I would have this habit of quickly looking away as I scrolled passed it. Then looked back when it was gone, while I also had a stomach ache. I remembered  the times he would tell me all these things, and slowly started realising how sick his behaviors had really been, and that I have PTSD issues. 7 years later and  I have a great relationship. Did therapy. But recently realised that I still get anxious when I look around and at people. I try not to look at men to much, even in conversations. With this underlaying fear.

We drove around for a bit, and then we were going to go to his house so I could stay the night. I don\u2019t know why I said okay in the first place, but I felt really uneasy about it, so I told him as we were driving that I wasn\u2019t feeling well and asked if he could just bring me back to my dorm. He said yes, but soon he started saying \u201cwe need to not talk anymore, this is all stupid\u201d. I said \u201cokay\u201d, and that\u2019s all.\n\nWe arrived in the dorm parking lot, and just as I was about to get out of the car, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t ever want you to text me again. Don\u2019t contact me ever again.\u201d This made me feel really nervous, because I worry about him and feel as though it is my job to make sure he\u2019s okay. I also still care a lot about him, even though we\u2019ve been broken up a few months. I asked him why he was suddenly saying he never wanted to speak again. It escalated very quickly, to him yelling and me crying. He was yelling all sorts of things, saying I\u2019m an idiot and stupid, that I ruin everything and no one loves me, and lunging at me like he was going to hit me.

I heard him screaming at me to get out of the car, but during bad attacks I sometimes dissociate so badly/am so afraid that I can\u2019t move, I just sit and curl up in a ball and cry. He knows I get a freeze response when he screams at me, but he was just telling me to get out again and again, getting angrier and angrier.\n\nSo, as he\u2019s escalating, I am getting more and more afraid. At this point I literally have my hands pressed in my hair, I am rocking back and forth and crying very hard, ugly, snotty tears. He knows I\u2019m really afraid and can\u2019t move or get up to my room on the fourth floor. He continues yelling, and then goes inside the entryway of the dorm, where a girl has been waiting for her friend for a few minutes. He tells her I won\u2019t get out of his car, and to get an RA. As soon as he\u2019s out of the car and too far to hurt me, I come to my senses enough to leave the car and run past him inside.

Security came because the girl had called them when she saw him screaming at me, but obviously he was already gone.\n\nAnyway, I am really overwhelmed with all this.

I just don't want to reread any of it. Stuffs hard enough to live. \n\nFor years, I've been slowly tortured and bent into the crude shape of the person that I am. This is a true story that's the summary of the last 11 years of my life, told to the best of my ability. I am 16,so obviously I won't remember everything, but I'll do my best. It'll be a long story though, so get comfy if you plan to stick around. \n\nEverything began when I was about 5 or 6. Before then, my brother had always been a role model, fun, full of jokes, and always ready to help out. He was the person who taught me how to write my name for God's sake. But that began to change. Gradually, but definitely. He began poking fun. Name calling, playing annoying and harmless jokes, etc. Just regular big brother stuff. Being a bratty little kid, I would cry out over the little things and didn't know how to control my temper, but my parents still tried to step in cause I had always been a sweet kid too. Picking on me has always been a big 'no' because of my sensitivity. So that's how it stayed for the time being. \n\nIt didn't really escalate until I was a bit older, maybe 7. I was playing with a train set in my brother's room and he started to tell me to leave cause I was \"playing wrong\" or something. I told him no, considering that I've always been stubborn as a mule, this wasn't surprising. We bickered for only a moment longer before he picked me up and slammed me against the wall. Though he wasn't a big kid (being only 18 months older), he's always been strong as hell cause he's always liked a variety of sports. And I was pretty small, so it's not weird that he could do that. Of course, once I got my footing, I left quickly. I know this happened because I drew out what happened in a tiny notebook that I found while cleaning out my room recently which made me want to write this here. Of course, this story isn't something to lose sleep over, but I haven't gotten to any of it yet. 11 years is a long time. \n\nAgain, there was a quiet period. I was a very happy kid, so even though my brother got on my nerves, I had always been smiley. But a lot began happening. My brother had constant breakdowns, yelling, screaming, threatening, lots of ugly stuff. And my dad has always had a similar temper to him, so arguments tended to last. But there were a few that went so far that I had to leave the house with a blanket and lay on a couch we had on the deck till it calmed down. Looking back now, I'm surprised at how calm I was, usually being enamored by the number of fireflies overhead or by some sound coming from the yard, rather than the yelling and crashing from the house. My parents, being by no means abusive, sometimes would hit my brother. Not hard, because again, they're really lovely people, but my brother wasn't learning anything. Yelling wasn't enough. \n\nIt's kind of blurry for the next couple years, all I remember is that we tried counseling, other forms of punishment and coaxing, but he wouldn't stop. \n\nHere are a couple of key memories when we were  still young that I will never forget too:\nOne, we never got along, even on Christmas eve. But one year takes the cake for the worst Christmas eve to ever happen. December 24th, 2012. My brother and I had been fighting again. When we're put to bed, my parents and other relatives tend to have the TV on outside, so we used to talk in quiet, angry whispers so we weren't heard. That night, I don't remember much that was said, but I do remember one thing very specifically: my brother telling me that \"I'd be better off dead than alive. \" Now, I was 10 at the time and that was the same year that my mom was sent to the hospital for heart issues, my dad had to go to work 2 hours away because his company couldn't afford to keep him (he was a chemist and their project was extremely expensive, so he was let go along with many other employees), and the year that my mom's account was robbed of 1000+ dollars. Thinking back, this may have been his way of letting off steam, but still. I was a little kid, not to mention his sister. When I tried to tell my parents, they didn't believe me. So I went to bed, teary eyed and defeated. \n\nAnother memory comes from about 2 years later. I had done some pet sitting for a family up our street for a sweet cat named Rascal. I loved going over and playing with him and he seemed to enjoy it too. So, they generously paid me with around 60 dollars and a case of those nutella to go things, along with a case of tic tacs (they had them because they worked for the company). I decided to bring the case to school to split amongst my friends, so I put it beside my bag. My brother, however, decided that wouldn't be the case. He picked it up and held it over my head, now towering over me, laughing and telling me to just give it to him. I told him that I wanted to give it to my friends. Then he said \u201cwhat friends\u201d and started to carry off the case. So, being angry at this point, I got into a little fight. I punched him and tackled him, knocking the box from his hands before he slid me into a wall, snatching the box and taking it from me. I tried telling my parents, but they didn't believe me and said that they were going to get rid of the case. He wins again. \n\nI don't exactly remember when this next one happened, but I do remember that times have only gotten worse since with him. He's noticed that he's begun to break my once happy and resilient demeanor. So he tried to drive it home. One day, I was playing on the desktop since its the only computer we had at the time. I was playing Minecraft, as I did, failing at many of the games that I was playing, but still having fun. I had closed the door, hopefully to not allow the sounds of the keyboard outside of the room. My brother loved taunting me until I left the computer, considering that he would then hit it for the rest of the day and late into the night. Not to mention being one of those people who beat the screen and the keyboard when he lost. Sadly, he did hear, coming in, uninvited, and sitting directly above my shoulder. He breathed very loudly on purpose, right down my neck. I have always needed personal space, so he knew that this was a step too far for me. I told him to sit down, and at first all was fine. Then, he began to tell me that I was doing stuff wrong in the most annoying way possible. I just ignored him. So he became bored and asked if I could get his headphones. I said no, considering I was in the middle of a game and he could just get them. So, he huffs, leans over, and turns off the computer while getting his headphones. He \u2018innocently\u2019 apologizes before standing up and saying that I should get his phone for him. Angry at this point, I do. I pretend to hand it to him, but I instead throw it outside of the room. Though it was unscathed, this was a big mistake. As I tried to quickly close the door to lock it and keep him out, he slammed it open. He was pretty angry by now and got into my face. He said \u201cyou better apologize right now.\u201d So, thinking I was some kind of toughy, got right up in his face, glaring directly into his eyes. I said \u201cmake me\u201d. He almost did. I never apologized, but he proceeded to hit me, not with baby hits, but with hits of actual brute strength, the first of which would've knocked me down if I didn't have the adrenaline pumping. Not only that, but he hit the same shoulder, brutally, five times. Each being harder than the last. Somehow, I managed to keep my composure before closing the door where I promptly began to cry. I don't bruise easily and that bruise lasted me for around 2 months, tender to the touch, meaning I had to walk around with my bookish slung on one shoulder unless I felt I could bare the pain. I only showed it to one friend about 3 weeks after that event. She didn't want to believe it. I did tell my parents, but by then they couldn't do much, so they yelled at him and all that, but not much more happened. \n\nThis is all I feel up for now. I'm going to continue soon whether anyone cares or not, considering I want my story somewhere to be found by other struggling people. It does get worse and even kind of weird and I'm too tired to deal tonight. Maybe tomorrow I'll finish. ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

My face was covered by my blanket, that I still remember till this day, and I also recognized his voice/breathing.

My mom has gone through something similar, however she was raped when she was 3-4 by a cousin. \n\nI've told her before because I thought that she'd understand but the atmosphere just felt cold and I felt as if I was being scolded. My mom isn't good at consoling since shes very blunt, so I don't talk about it with her but I want to. \n\nI love her smile, and even when I'm in trouble or she's in a bad mood I get to see that smile in some point of the day or at least hear her laugh. When we used to talk about the incident there was no smiling and I didnt hear laughter for a minimum of three days. And it hurts because it's my fault that she's not smiling. \n\nI haven't told her about the dreams yet and I don't know how, all she knows is how I remember the incident but when I told her she forced me to call and question the uncle that touched me. That also made me feel less safe with her. I feel like I just have to keep everything to myself because my dad will start to feel guilty, my mom will start talking about sending him to court and have me testify and go to therapy and I didn't want that. I want to be normal, is that too hard to ask... \n\nAfter the situation cooled and we stopped talking about it the dreams disappeared, but then I got a boyfriend. And he looked similar to the man who did this too me. I didn't think about it because I had forgotten, and all I did was like his smile... But he kept looking at me like how a normal teenage boy would look at his \"girlfriend\" and I've never been more frightened in my life. I broke It up after three days, but now my dreams are getting worse. Its to the point where Im scared to go outside, I'm scared to hug and kiss my own father and brothers, the dark thoughts are coming back. \n\nIt's even worse because some nights when I'm not strong enough I avoid to go to bed because I just don't want to risk re-living the scenario over and over. Less sleep is affecing my grades, and that makes mom unhappy too but I don't know what to do. I just want to be happy and I want her to be happy too. \n\nSorry this is so long but I just want to be free but I don't know a lighter route", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I'll try to summarise it fast but I been to a pysch and I'm gonna go for cognitive testing, I suspect I have ADHD, that's just 1 of my issues (my parents don't know about this). I tell them I can't focus and concentrate properly and they tell me it's normal and that I'm just lazy. My dad gets mad at me sometimes, it's pretty much when he's in a bad mood and is irritated and he'll talk about me out loud and swear and say mean things, I tell him to stop and he continues no matter how upset I am. Then every time I try to tell my mother if she's done something that's hurt me she'll close her eyes, won't listen, laugh at me, even if i'm crying she'll just laugh at me. Then she'll start talking about how i don't have a fulltime job, dont have my license. She even said before that when she'd old I'll probably be one of those kids who put her in a nursing home and abuse their parents. Then she said when she was my age she had a full time job, lots of friends she went out with, a license, a boyfriend... Sometimes I'd be upset and bring up really terrible things she did in the past and she'd laugh about it and be like \"hahahaha did I give you childhood trauma? what do you want me to do? apologise?\" She literally will not apologise for any mistakes. She changes the subject, sht talks me. She always blames me. In the end it's my fault. She can come home nervous and take her anger out on me, and it's my fault because of how I am. My inability to concentrate (because of potential ADHD) is my fault because I'm lazy. When I was little she told me she was divorcing my father and it's my fault. She told me while she was driving the car and her eyes lit up and she turned evil, and she rev'd the engine and sped up really fast When I was younger she would threaten that if I told anyone these 'lies' I'd get taken away. She banged the hairbrush on the bench once and said to me \"tonight youre going to die\" when I was about 12. In the end I would always apologise to her, I don't know why. Then I'll feel so guilty afterwards. My dad always defends her, but in secret he tells me just ignore her theres nothing I can do shes stressed and I should have more understanding. It confuses me because other times she'll be so kind, kiss my cheek, tell me she loves me, pay for things for me, take me out. Same with my dad. So I thought it's just something I've done.. Just a few months ago she told me I'm no where in life and pulled my hair really bad. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I notice I'm always defending her, at the psychiatrist he figured I'm not really close with her but I didn't tell him why. I'm seeing him in 2 months, do you think it's worth bringing up**? It's when he'll have my diagnosis but I hope it's not too late to tell him. Do you think this could have an effect on me? I can't make little choices and I always ring her up and ask, I don't know. My mum told me other peoples parents are the same, everyone gets mad sometimes.

I don't really k ow what to do now. I would like to tell my family but, my cousin, let's call him \"GB\" is the golden boy of the family. The one that was chosen to protect the younger cousin's ( we are all girls btw) I am the youngest. \n\nHe is 3 years older then me so he was 16 when this all ended. I understand that we when children when this All started but, I'm.still hurt. Some people told me that we were both young so I should forgive him his child curiosity. But, he was 16 when this was over and that I cannot forgive. He started  by playing house with me and   having me show him my body and it was routine. I came to his house, he built and fort then he would force me to strip. Poke and prod then tell me to.dress and it would be like nothing happend. \n\nThis all took a drastic turn when I turned 9 and he was twelve. In my family we develop very fast. I was already a set of very noticable brest and my body was changing already curving . People used to think  was 13 already. This when he started making me give him head. It was so embarrassing I would cry but he would make me do it for what felt like hours. Then he started trying to make me have sex with him. And at 10 he did it. \n\nForced his way inside me and tore away do violently and locked myself in the bath room. The next time he forced anal on me and I tore. It was horrific I had to hid that from my mom. The bleeding and sting. He would  force anal sex on my for the next 2 years. Untill I was 13 and I got my period. It was like he no longer wanted to touch me. I thanked god that I got my period be ause it all stopped. But, i have been scared now. I can't be in a room alone with a guy for two long or I have an anxiety attack. I am trying to love my self but I feel my body is dirty.

I dont know what to do I cant tell me family they wont  Believe me.\n\n It eating me up inside I want to do all these things with my boyfriend but a smell, a touch, even a word will trigger me. With all the time me and GB  spent together my family thought we were thick and thieves and really he was just keeping me close and making me fear telling the family. He side that he would make them believe that it was all me and I believe him ...hell I still do. I dont know what to do. I'm scared. This is running my life and not the other way around.

This continued until I was about 9 or 10. \n\nMy parents had a very harsh life. They grew up in a 3rd world country in the middle of a civil war and in an environment where beating your kids to within an inch of their life was considered normal. Thus, I don't entirely blame them for how they were with us.\n\nWhen I was finishing up elementary school, my parents finally started getting help with their trauma and turned to religion to make themselves better people. If you met them now, you'd never believe that my mother would drag us by our hair, stomp on our hands on purpose, hit us for even saying the wrong thing at the wrong time and call us \"useless little bitches\" and \"good for nothing\". Like I said, my mother was my main abuser, while my dad was an aloof drunk. They are very good people now.\n\nBy the time my seven year old sister was born (I was 14 at the time), they were so coddling and loving to her. She had birthday parties, my mother bought her many toys, my dad would take her to Chuck E Cheese...I was envious of that. While my parents are good to me now, I feel envious of my little sister, because that is stuff I wanted as a kid. Even now, I envy her. I am currently 21, soon to be 22, jealous of a 7 year old kid with a learning disability. It embarrasses me even saying that.\n\nI guess I'm posting this to vent. I dont vent my feelings to my older sisters because my mom was easy on me compared to them. I got my fair share of hitting with shoes and being dragged around, but they had it much worse than me. So I guess I feel ashamed. \n\nI haven't told anyone else about my childhood. Just my boyfriend. I thought I forgave them a long time ago, but as of lately I feel very angry when I think about their treatment of us. My parents never apologized, but I know they feel bad.

Apparently our manager must have given them some sort of coaching and my coworker seems to think I am the reason behind it (they are wrongly assuming). I really don\u2019t want to have to quit my job and this person thrives on high school drama/ triangulation at the workplace. Overall this person won\u2019t look at or talk to me except to be rude/ attempt to make me look dumb and they have attempted to report normal work behavior to management as revenge.  I can hear them gossiping about me and I do my best to bit my tongue.  I keep trying to be the bigger person but it\u2019s not working. I have gone up to them directly and asked them if I did something wrong, if everything is okay and I get a cold shoulder and one word answers. We had a meeting months ago because the drama reached an all time high when the triangulation/ abuse was directed to a new trainee.  We all got a stern warning about gossip and respect and reminded to speak to each other professionally. I honestly believe this person would have been fired long ago if the relative was not in power. Any advice on how to proceed?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It\u2019s probably gonna be long! \n\n1: very very early into our relationship my ex told me all his crazy baggage and then prompted me for mine. I unknowingly told him everything as he seemed to have laid his heart out for me. Well I think he knew/had a feeling about a piece of my past and he told me a relatable story. Then when I accepted that story, he gave me more details. But it was INSANE like I can\u2019t believe that actually happens outside of horror films. But I had no reason not to believe and I didn\u2019t question because what kind of person would that make me? So we bonded IMMENSELY on that shared experience. Then a few days later I was told that event had happened to him not once but three times. It seemed like the less I questioned the crazier the story got. \n\n2: my ex paid for absolutely everything right off the bat, I offered of course but he always insisted. Then as I got more comfortable I would joke around and try to snatch his credit card from his hands and this pissed him off so much. I would get the silent treatment until we left wherever we were even though I was obviously joking. We both knew my ex made way more money than I did and he bought me such extravagant gifts, completely correlates with the lovebombing. Whenever I tried to buy things for my ex they went COMPLETELY unappreciated so I stop trying as hard and of course that bit me in the ass during the breakup. \n\n3: if you\u2019ve ever heard of stonewalling in a relationship- that was me. Towards the later half of the relationship I would go mute anywhere from 20 min to an hour every time I was with my ex (which was all the time). I know this is something I need to work on, but my ex started off loving and trying to help when this happened to getting mad. But it was always in response to a comment he had made. However, I don\u2019t remember any of these comments and if they were triggering or mean or whatever. I just know that they hurt and I wanted to stop talking so that I wouldn\u2019t do anything else wrong. When I think back on the relationship though, no comment, except maybe one or two really stand out as being cruel so I don\u2019t know why I would have resorted to stonewalling. But you know how it goes- if someone\u2019s exes are all crazy, they were probably sane at the start and went crazy during. \n\nI just struggle between rationalizing my side and his side and I never get anywhere except accepting most of the blame for the demise of the relationship. I feel crazy for thinking he\u2019s a narcissist because he doesn\u2019t fit all the criteria but I know that a lot of his behaviors were not normal. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I would spend hours searching for gifts I felt really suited him. I would brush snow off of his car many mornings before work during the winters. I threw a surprise birthday party for him, but was upset when his mom wouldn't show up because I felt like she finally had the chance to be a good mom to her kid and couldn't even do something simple. Anything kind I have done has been thrown in my face, \"You did that for yourself, not for me. You wanted people to see that you loved me, not actually love me\" or whatever other nasty thing he could say after we ended.

We broke up almost a week ago. Our relationship was that of a typical love bomb, but I didn't see it as such (do we ever?). We were obsessed with each other, spent every single day together, got along amazingly, until a month in I began feeling weary about her relationships with her exes. She speaks to 2 of them nearly every day via text, having long intimate convos (non romantic), sending selfies, heart eye emojis, including them in what she's doing throughout the day by sending pictures. We actually ran into 3 different exes of hers throughout the 2 months we were together. One of them was one she talks to every day, and she was extremely rude to us in person. One of her exes that she texts every day lives in a different country and never knew about me. I had to ask her 4 times to tell her about me, and she still never did. During our breakup talk, she told me the reason she never wanted to tell her was because she was afraid of losing that person. And then shifted the blame on me for not telling her about me. She also sent a message to one of the ones we ran into saying she has a girlfriend now but still likes f\\*cking her. I confronted her on all of these things and tried setting boundaries multiple times but she would get angry and gaslight me telling me she wasn't sorry or guilty for it because she wasn't doing anything wrong at all and I should trust her. Our dynamic quickly changed because I was miserable with how she was disrespecting my boundaries and feelings, and she would respond to my lack of affection by being aloof, cold, condescending and controlling of me. During our breakup talk she showed no emotion whatsoever. I watched her go from wanting to make plans with me the following day, to quickly saying the breakup was totally mutual and that she wasn't happy and her feelings had changed. She wanted to continue to be friends but I told her I had no interest in that and wanted a clean break. I left, we haven't spoken since. All her friends unfollowed me on social media. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow - my roommate and I had a pretty intense disagreement about something regarding the place we're renting and haven't spoken in a couple days. Yesterday I noticed her and my ex started following each other on social media. I'm very confused about this because my roommate has no respect for my ex after what she put me through and how she changed through our relationship. She was my #1 confidant with everything regarding that relationship so I'm very surprised and a bit nervous. Is my ex possibly sticking her feelers out into my circle of people and my roommate obliged because she's upset at me right now? My roommate is not gay at all so that definitely has nothing to do with it. It seems like something so small but it actually makes me feel sick and a bit betrayed ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She's on the phone and talking to a police officer. I sit in the back in silence. I don't understand.\n\nI remember being 5 and seeing my father on the other side of glass.

You can even turn the wheels but they don't go anywhere. I hear my name being called. Someone grabs my arm and I look up to see my father for the first time in months. He's taking me to his car. I squirm and try to pull away because I still want to ride the rides but he tells me we'll come back another time. He's putting me in a car and strapping my into the car seat as I hear my mother calling for me. I see her run to the car with two men in uniforms. My dad jumped in the car and tries to drive away but they stop him somehow. My mother takes me out of my seat and next thing I know I'm in her car again. She's crying again. I don't understand.\n\nI remember being 8 and hearing the glass shatter. A brick has been thrown through the window of our trailer. My mother won't let us go back home for a while after that. Later I hear about the note that was tapped to it and how he's out of jail again. My mother keeps on crying. I don't understand.\n\nI remember being 17 and facing my father for the first time in years. A small girl with big brown eyes looks nervously up at me from behind his legs.  He tells me he's sorry and he'd love for me to come back into his life and spend time with my new half-sister. He pushes the little girl forward and she latches onto my leg now. All I can do is hope, for her sake, that this time it's different. That, for her, she will have only good things to remember about this man who caused me so much pain. I start crying. The little girl doesn't understand.\n\nIt's been about 2 years now since I've last seen my father. He's gotten a lot better over the years and has stayed out of my life for the most part, but I still can't forgive him for what he did to me and my mother. While my mother is no saint either (thats a subject for another post) she didn't deserve the suffering he caused her over the years. I wish I could forgot all the bad memories of my childhood he's given me.\n\nTL;DR- My dad beat up my mother, had me visit him in jail when I was 5, tries to kidnap me, throws a brick through our window, and expects me to forget all my childhood trauma and be in my new half-sisters life.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

We \"dated\" for roughly 2 weeks, but me being 15 deemed that as a \"proper relationship\". I would go over his house every night, and usually we would hang out in the living room but he really wanted to go upstairs and \"listen to some music\". I said yes because his family would always be in the living room, so I saw this as my opportunity to finally get to know him. We did listen to music, and I can't really remember what happened in between but he ended up on top of me. I was terrified because I didn't want to do anything sexual, some people may use the word \"frigid\" to describe me. He practically begged me to allow him to do sexual things to me, and I kept saying no. I finally said yes after he wouldn't stop asking, and even when he was doing the things he would continuously ask for more. It only stopped when my dad called to say he was outside to collect me. That was the last time I ever saw Bill*, but we still messaged each other.\n\nA few days later my step-mum (C) recieved an email off of my birth mum (L). (L) told (C) that Bill* had told my half-sister everything he had done to me, he told her the marks me had left on my body and the things he did to me in full detail. He told his whole school. I showed my step-mum the marks but I said the sexual things weren't true. My mum hated me and even said it was my fault, and my mum's side of the family completed disowned me. They didn't even ask me first what had happened, she went straight to my step-mum.

I felt emotionally numb. I had to deal with her problems, and on top of that she told me to go talk to the person she loved to make sure he\u2019s okay. Now, I couldn\u2019t sleep that night, my brother gave me a hug when I woke up. Three days later she contacts me trying to pressure me into telling me who she liked, (Which was the ex) I didn\u2019t tell her, we get into an argument, she guilt tripped me heavily, then said she was going to punch a wall, then logged off. Insert more crying, then one of my friends showed me way more compassion than my ex had showed me, she said I was always happy and bubbly and *Ex* was ruining that, then said she found me a nickname, Sunny, during that time I cried, a mix of happiness and sadness, but I felt happy, happier than I had in a while. Then, my ex asked me out two nights later, I spent 10 hours trying to find a way to say no without hurting her, then I said No, I have to move to Hawaii (This is half true, I just wanted to keep the happiness I have.) 5 hours later she found a new bf, she began practically shoving in my face she was happier with him, she said how they kissed and cuddle, and to say I was sad was a understatement, I put all my effort into making her happy, one of my friends decided to try and help me, he messaged my ex telling her to fuck off, and a bunch of other shit, she left me alone, then Two nights later, she contacts me with a sob story about how she was deleting her insta, I was feeling extremely depressed that night, (something I haven\u2019t told my friends, but I was generally considering cutting myself that night, I had began to burn my hands with hot water when I took showers like halfway through my relationship with her) my ex blocks me and I thought it was finally all over.\n\nAround a week later she makes a post on her public Facebook saying I had manipulated her, I learned through my now best friend Julia, (The person who also introduced me to ex) so I make a post saying \u201cshould I defend myself?\u201d Ex gets mad, tells me to fuck off, then her friends threaten to bash me, I was fucking fuming because the dumb fucking cunt had publicly slandered me, I told her to take the post down (she did an hour later, if she went to my school, I probably would outcasted, I\u2019m glad she doesn\u2019t) then, the apology happens, I\u2019ll explain in another paragraph later, but let me explain pre apology, ex cuts her foot on something, one of her friends I\u2019m still friends with says that she cut her foot, I say why the fuck does this concern me, somehow this derails into me talking about the breakup, I tell the friend my side of the story, how I was depressed and shit. Then the friend tells me to talk to ex, I refuse then finally agree to try.\n\nNow, let me tell you something, I am expecting the worst, but she seems quite calm. I explain that friend told me to talk to her, then she reveals, she stole friends phone, talked to me for an hour about the breakup, then proceeds to apologise for everything she did (I don\u2019t think she actually meant it as she only apologised, and did nothing to fix my reputation) I accept it like the little softie I am and then tell her to never contact me again, now, I want you to decide if she was abusive, I have no idea is she was or not, one of my friends who was abused in the past claimed she definitely was. But I want more people to decide, I am now in a happy relationship with my new boyfriend, he has genuinely made me happy, I have made him happy. We were friends for two years and he confessed he developed a crush on me, I liked him back.

I'm currently 20F, but at the time I ended my relationship with my abusive partner I was 18.\n\nI want to note that I've had 4 abusive relationships, which have all hurt me in different ways, with the relationship spoken about in this post being the one that, to this day, has the most impact. Chronologically they go as follows:\n\n1- I was dating a guy and he forced me into sex \n2- The experience I speak of in this post. \n3- Emotionally abusive relationship with a guy I really cared about, but it just wasn't going to work. \n4- An emotionally abusive friendship where he(25) tried to manipulate me into dating him, moving in with him, marrying and having children with him. Was extremely manipulative and tried his damndest to break me and 3 up so that he could take me as his own. He then flipped out when he heard I was speaking to F (Guy I am now dating) weeks after I stopped being friends with his abusive ass.. He also has threatened my 17 year old brother, my 27 year old brother and slated my family because I ended up dating F. (If you want me to make a post about him feel free to comment, he is genuinely crazy). \n\n\nMe: Me.\n\nP: Abusive ex boyfriend who is currently (24, but 22 at the end of our relationship) \n\nF: Guy I'm currently dating who is currently 24 (Ps best friend since age 11)\n\nSo I recently had an experience that I won't go through that changed the way I am as a person a LOT it made me think about what I want in life and made me really appreciate the people in my life. It made me decide to hit up F (who I was friends with when with P) because I'd always had a crush on him, but was with P. I had missed F a lot and wanted to get back in touch with him and felt I had the courage due to this experience, we've been dating for about 5 months and it's had its ups and downs like any relationship, but I really enjoy our time together and having him in my life. \n\n\nP and I were together for 3 years, I was 15 when we started dating and he was 19 (yes, messed up, redflag, but not the main issue). Half way through our relationship I admit to doing probably the shittiest thing I've ever done (I was 17) and cheated on P. I admitted to him immediately after what I did, was profusely sorry and he ended up forgiving me and we tried again. It was tough, but he understood my circumstances, understood my idiocy and gave me another chance (I feel now that even trying again was a mistake as things were not going well at all up until I cheated anyway). Before I cheated he was manipulative, strict and cruel. As a young student, I did not have a job and any penny I had would go to him or go to seeing him as he lived in a town away from mine. He would tell me off and say I was wasteful for spending my money on things for myself or things I enjoyed. And would be very strict about me having to go see him on weekends and having to be there at a certain time very early in the morning, if I was even a little bit late (if the bus was late for example) there would be hell to pay. All of these aspects got worse after I did the incredibly shitty thing I did despite the fact he forgave me and we were trying to move on. \n\nIt got to the point where I would say sorry multiple times a day for doing something wrong or saying something wrong. Like being a couple minutes late because of the bus, doing homework so not being on my phone and able to speak to him or for just saying something and him misinterpreting what I had said and then using it against me. He'd often tell me I wasn't putting enough effort into our relationship and use me cheating to emphasise his point, despite us trying again. It was as if since I'd fucked up so badly he finally had something to manipulate me to the fullest extent with. He'd make me go to his house even more often, after UK college, stay the night etc. Even if I said I couldn't because I had to do homework, revision or had family commitments. There was no saying no. As well as this, occasionally when he was upset with me (even over very little things) he would ignore me completely for days on end, no contact whatsoever then suddenly come back, make me apologise (even though I already had a million times) then act like nothing happened. I just put up with it getting worse and worse and thought that he would settle down when he realised I wasn't going anywhere and wasn't going to hurt him again. \n\nIt did settle a little bit (or I just got used to it who knows) but starting the last Christmas we were together.. Things got so much worse. We'd been doing well. But I had no money due to not working (P wouldn't actually let me work and would talk me out of it because he'd have less time with me) and couldn't ask my parents for money because we are quite poor. So when I finally got money 3 days before Christmas I told him that I would take him shopping to get whatever he wanted and then after getting money at Christmas from family and friends that I would take him out for a meal. He said that was fine and seemed understanding I kept apologising profusely for not being able to get him anything sooner because of not having money. Christmas eve came around and I was just finishing wrapping his presents and writing on his card, I had \u00a330 left which I was saving. We were going to exchange gifts on boxing day. However, I get a call from P and he says that I should come and give him his presents that night, I explain that I can't because I'd have to get a taxi there and back and that it would be incredibly expensive on Christmas eve and that I also wanted to spend time watching films with my family. He insisted. And when he insists.. I had to. So I went gave him his gifts and despite him choosing them he was disappointed. He gave me mine, and I was honestly, disappointed with them, they were all cheap items he had gotten cheap with hotukdeals and other websites, which I don't mind (it's not the money that counts), but it was all stuff I wasn't interested in and wouldn't want as if he didn't know me, but I took it was happy because I knew he tried and I knew I'd find use for them, which I did. He didn't even get and write me a card (he'd bought one he just couldn't be bothered), but I wrote him a huge card telling him how much I cared, not a space was free. He didn't. About a week later and he shouts at me for not pre planning his gifts (despite the fact I did, but just couldn't order them because I had no money until a few days before, I explained this several times but then told him that I would get him the gits I had planned soon anyway, but I had wanted it to be a complete surprise). He continues telling me off for this pretty much for the next 6 months (when we finally break up). \n\nIn a past relationship I had been forced into sex. I was also groomed when I was 9, which made my relationship with sex difficult. I had told that P within us early dating. \n\nThen about 2 weeks after Christmas this happened.. I won't go into detail, but I have pretty bad depression and sometimes it causes me to have really low labido when usually I have quite high labido. We hadn't had sex in a few weeks. P started saying that sex was a big deal to him (after saying all of our relationship that if we couldn't have sex that we would still be together because sex doesn't matter to him), I explained why my labido was low and explained that it'll sort itself out soon enough and just told him it's okay, just be patient I'll be back to normal in no time. So he told me if I didn't have sex with him that he'd break up with me. So.. We had sex. I didn't enjoy it, infact it hurt a lot. Afterwards I told him he'd forced me and that I really didn't like it reminded him of an experience with an ex and he apologised. He was crying and saying he'd never do it again. So I forgave him. It happened at least 5 more times. Each time he got more aggressive until I was literally just saying no. We'd be lay in bed, I'd have college early the next morning and he'd grab my legs until I bruised through his sexual frustration. I'd try to stop him, but he'd just continue to do it. Sex was painful. And my labido was lower than ever. He made me believe at times that I owed him it because of me cheating on him about a year and some before. He made me really hate myself. \n\nThen everything got worse, but I pretty much pretended it wasn't. I did everything he said. I was nearing my A level exams, it was really important, but he was making me go to his house all the time. Then shunning me for not doing homework etc. But he hated me doing work when I was with him because he said he thought that we should pay attention to each other when together, but would happily leave me to watch TV on my own because he wanted to play video games with his friends. He would ignore me for days more and more. I would errange plans and he'd cancel them that day leaving me stuck at college because I had to get a college bus home or to his and the college bus home left earlier than the one to his house. He would belittle me. Make me feel like crap infront of our friends including F. He would have a go at me for not responding in time, or not responding as indepth because I was doing work or if my phone wasn't receiving messages or something else I couldn't control. But when he left me for days (upto a week) without speaking to me, apparently that was fine. He would still expect me to pay for things for him all the time despite having no income and no time to get an income. He didn't like me spending time with my family, he didn't like spending time in my town or with my family so I always had to go to him. When he changed jobs he got a job near my college and I'd see him on lunch, he'd ask me to see him on lunch. He'd get annoyed when I didn't message him back despite being in lessons. He didn't like me having other friends. He told me off for going on my first ever club experience (with all female friends) because clubbing wasn't his style and \"clubbing is for single people\". But I had intended to marry him and spend the rest of my life with him and just wanted that usual teenage experience. I had asked him if he wanted to go with us, but he said no. I was going on a caravan holiday with my family and had asked if he wanted to go with us months before. He said no. I said okay, well I'm still going to go. A week before I tell him that I'm going on a family holiday on that week, but coming home 2 days early as I had forgotten that I'd booked my driving theory test. He had a go at me for it because I hadn't told him, I reminded him I'd asked him and he said \"yeah, but that was months ago you told me\". He didn't speak to me all of the holiday or even when I was home for 2 days. I tried calling him because I was in a rough area at night to get home after the holiday and he ignored me and I was like \"please I'm just really scared\" he said that he didn't care and didn't care about me at the moment. I tried calling him to say that I had passed my theory test, he ignored my call and my message. He would ignore me at least once a week for 2 days. He would tell me off for speaking in a discord of our friends (one of which being F) because he wanted me to talk to him, so I told him to get in the group discord and he said no because he wanted to talk to me. I don't understand why he couldn't talk to our friends too, that I had barely been able to talk to because of being busy. \n\nOne night he threw things at me hitting me in thr face. Pushed me, screamed at me. Just because I asked him to to move over a little in the bed because I had my legs completely off the side of the bed (I learned my lesson after this and would just not sleep instead to avoid making him angry).\n\nHe was sexually, emotionally and physically abusive and this is only the tip of the iceberg. I repressed a lot of these memories until I casually told them to a friend and he urged me to get out of the relationship. I told P about the sexual abuse and how if somehow I can get over that we can carry on, if he'd apologise or make me feel more comfortable with him or something. He didn't. So we broke up. 2 weeks he begged for me back and I repressed everything again until I got with F. \n\nWhen I started talking to F the prospect that I might end up seeing P again brought back all these memories and emotions that I had hidden away in the back of my mind to try to protect myself. I was struggling anyway, but realising everything, a year and a half on, and the possibility of seeing P. F talking about P even. Has been so difficult for me, it brought back the trauma of the relationship and I was able to fully tell a friend about my experience and I was like holy shit that was so messed up! And they were like yeah I know! But I just didn't realise it until now. \n\nThese trust issues. The fact that Ps name burns in my ears. The fact I feel like the worst person ever for what I did to him, and that I keep telling myself he was in the right because I cheated even though everyone (including F says that it's no excuse for him to rape me). I feel I always have to be perfect and when I mess up I try to run away. So I'll say something to F and he won't be hurt or offended by it it'll just be me saying that I didn't like the way he did something in our relationship and he'd be completely reasonable, but I instantly start apologising and saying I'm awful and that he shouldn't be with me to the point where I have the compulsion to end it because I'm so scared of saying something he might dislike whether big or small. My insecurities and the way I react are having an impact on my relationship and F says its okay and that he understands, but he doesn't know what to do and it's hurting him because I keep trying to run from him and he just doesn't know what he can do to stop me from doing it. The more he feels this the more I want to run. It's something I feel I can't control, I get panicky, hyperventilate, stress, cry then tell him \"we shouldn't do this anymore, I'm a horrible person and I'm sorry\" I don't know what to do because (whilst we've not said it yet because we're taking it very slow.. I love him so much and no one makes me smile as much as he does), but I'm genuinely fucking it up and I don't know how to calm myself down into not saying this dumbass shit that I really really don't mean. \n\nAny advice? \n\nAlternatively feel free to just tell me to seek mental health help. \n\nP.S. Cheating is bad, if anyone wants to lecture me on that go ahead, it was 3 years ago and I know not to deal with my emotions like that so you telling me it's bad and horrible.. Is completely pointless. As far as a TLDR.. You kind of need the context but just use the last big paragraph.. I can't really condense it down more than that.. But I'll give it a go..\n\nTLDR: my past relationship issues are impacting my current, wonderful relationship. I have the compulsion to run even though I really don't want to.

Potential suicidal triggers.", "author": "Noozaii", "self_text": "I've been lurking and reading in this sub for a few weeks now, and was originally shocked when I realised how many different posts in here described the same behavior as my roomie and erstwhile friend is exhibiting.\n\nThe reason I'm posting this is that I'm in doubt as to what I should do about this person. I'm sorry if this post breaks any rules of the sub, as I truly don't mean to be troublesome.\n\nHere's my story: my friend (let's say \"Z\") has been one of the people closest to me since I met him. I met Z at school when we were teenagers and we quickly bonded. 8 days after I met him I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and received a diagnosis - Paranoid Schizophrenia - and stayed there for 7 months due to my own suicidal tendencies and big issues at home. I stopped going to the school Z attended because of practical and logistic reasons, but Z kept me company by visiting when possible and keeping in touch via phone, Skype and world of warcraft. I was immensely unhappy, because of childhood trauma and neglect, and also attempted suicide while I was admitted. But Z never seemed afraid of knowing me, unlike most others.\n\nAfter I was discharged from the psychiatric hospital I moved into a halfway-home, which is basically an institution for youths who didn't fit into society for mental health reasons. The place was supposed to help me learn how to function through therapy. It didn't succeed, seeing as it was shut down because of negligence and abuse by some of the staff and the manager of the institution.\n\nAfter this I had some trouble with settling in to a new home, and Z suggested I could come live with him and another friend in a shared apartment. I agreed and had a blast for the first few years. Z invited me to parties, conventions and introduced me to a ton of new people. It was a good feeling for a long time.\n\nOne night, in the middle of a talk about something else, Z starts telling me that Z can't handle his own issues, much less mine any more, and that he's going to kill himself. Z has always had anger issues and has been diagnosed with depression, but never sought out a therapist. I tried talking and listening to Z, but would be met with shouting suicide threats, guilt tripping (I.E: \"I don't want to talk and you're making it worse by trying!\") or silence.\n\nZ began self-medicating with drugs and hard liquor. Z became more and more irrational in the following years, and blames everyone else, including me, for the troubles in Z's life.\n\nI've become increasingly afraid of Z's reaction to anything, and am walking on eggshells every day. Sometimes Z will pick a fight with me over something miniscule, and then turn it around and blame me for the bad mood.\n\nLast year I tried moving out, but Z gave me a sob story and promised to listen more and \"be better\", so I agreed to giving it another shot.\n\nNow another half year has passed and when I realised nothing had changed, I tried bringing it up, only to have Z explode into rage and tears and accuse me of being hurtful.\n\nI need to move out, that much is clear to me now. I started writing this post full of doubt as to whether or not I'm a bad friend or person, but I realized halfway through that I can't help someone who does not want to be helped. I can help myself, though.\n\nThank you for reading, for letting me vent and I wish you the very best in your own struggles.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I had to respond to her text messages instantly or I would pay the price. On a few occasions when we argued she called me disgusting things such as fat, grotesque, old, wrinkly.

I've never really told anyone this story, and it still hurts me a bit to this day. It's in regards to my mother and a Christmas weekend about seven years back. I hope this is okay to post this here. I'll try to remember how it went down, but my memory is a bit foggy.\n\nFor Christmas, we always go to my aunt's home, because my mother is a hoarder and no one is allowed in our house except my mom, my dad, me, and my best friend (because I used to sneak her in). One year, we were at my aunt's house a little early and were in a circle of about 10 people opening gifts. I began opening mine and was thanking my family members for their gifts. One of my boxes contained a pair of shoes. I'm not very into fashion, but I tried not to show that, because these were from my aunt and I didn't want her to feel like I didn't care. \n\nI said thank you and started setting them down when my mom immediately became angry at me. She said, irritated, \"Aren't you going to go try those on?\" I told her I would once I was done opening the other gifts, because I didn't want to leave anyone out. Keep in mind I was around 14 or 15 at the time. My mom claimed I was being incredibly rude and began raising her voice, while my family stared in shock. I kind of froze up and stammered, \"Is it not okay to just try them on once I'm done?\" My family members tried comforting me and simultaneously calming my mom down by saying things like, \"It's okay, you can try it on later\" and \"That's fine, right?\" \n\nMy mother became infuriated that *her own family* was not on her side (I'm adopted) and proceeded to grab my gift, and hit me in the face with it. All I remember from this point is that I began crying, my mom started yelling something, and my family members were trying to tell her to calm down and that I didn't do anything wrong. I think I finished with my gifts, tried on the shoes, and then we left to go back home. That's where it got worse.\n\nMy mom said something derogatory to me once we got home, but she called me so many names so often that I honestly can't remember what it was. I was upset, so I tried telling her it was messed up that she did that, especially in front of our whole family. She then proceeded to say I was ruining our family and that I don't love her. EVEN WORSE was she brought my father in to this, whom I love dearly. She threatened to divorce my dad, pack up her stuff, and go to her mother's house. All because of me. She told me that too. Because my dad has no living family and my mother and I are the only real family he has now, I had to beg her to stay. My dad would be destroyed. My mom ate that up. I told her she can't leave on Christmas and that it would ruin dad. Her only response was yelling, in my face, \"Well, it's what you want, isn't it?! I bet you'd love that!\" Aaaand, again, I kind of blacked out. I have no idea what happened after that ... Just that the next day, she was seemingly \"normal\", like nothing even happened. \n\nI've been seriously messed up since my childhood when I lived with her, because, as expected, this was not the only incident. I'd probably be a millionaire if I was paid for everything. My mom thinks she's some sort of untouchable deity and that I'm the antichrist, always guilt tripping me if I criticize her in any way. I've been so depressed, anxious, and angry since my childhood that it isn't even funny. I don't really know how to even get over any of this stuff. So, yeah...

Only way I won this one was googling official recommendations from vets online.

I said it would be good for us to incorporate more raw and whole foods into our diet at shared meals. He tried to convince me that cooked food and raw food are processed the exact same way in the body, have the same nutritional content, and the only difference is the oils/salts/etc. that are added or left out. I tried to explain how fiber works and how vitamins can be leeched out of boiled foods, etc. but he told me I was just wrong.

A bell pepper chopped into 6 large pieces or pieces the size of your pinky fingernail? Same. (Read: he didn't like chopping)\n\nThese are just a few examples that popped into my head just now.

We're young. I'm in my mid 20s, she her early 20's.  \n\n\nIt's a bit of a story.. I'll try to summarize the best.. we've had a rough road. We were sweethearts in high school. Shortly after she turned 18, we accidentally got pregnant. So.. I wasn't ready for a kid. I knew I wasn't. Nor she, but she wanted to keep it.   \n\n\nIn those days I liked her a lot. But... my family was also very unhappy with the news. Their scorn combined with my fears kind of lead us down the path of considering abortion.. annnd.. we did go through with it at that time. She was highly against it but for my sake and per the request of me and my family she did end up going through with it. It really messed with her emotionally however and.. I saw the pain. It tore me up. We were young, and stupid, and I felt so horrible for it all. I didn't know how to deal with those kinds of emotions and I also cared for her and how she felt and I just.. didn't know what to do. She really wanted to baby. I hated seeing how broken she had become.  \n\n\nAfter some time it became apparent that she was emotionally scarred to boot from this. I wanted to try and make things right. Not just for her, but because.. I felt as though it was a major fuck up to do what we had done in the first place it brought questions upon my morals that I had never had to confront before myself. We conceived a child.. we ended up having beautiful twins.   \n\n\nI love my sons more than anything in the world they are healthy wonderful little guys living it up at an undisclosed age right now.  \n\n\nBut despite all that... the fears of commitment struck me again, hard, during the pregnancy. I wasn't sure if I could see myself in such a lifetime situation with this girl. I had second thoughts. It pains me to say it and have to admit before anyone that this happened but it is the truth. I cheated during that time. Before the children were born, I confessed to her of this act. It really fucked everything up. And once again I was left wondering what the fuck have I done. As any newfound happiness was quickly snuffed out by my selfish actions, yet again.  \n\n\nBut, we stuck it out. We've been together for years. We've been through hell and back by now. She has obviously had severe issues trusting me. I don't blame her for this. The children came, we moved into parenthood.. and I tried to work with her on everything for a long, long time. I've tried to be patient. I've tried to take the blame. I've tried to be reassuring to the maximum degree. I've given her the benefit of the doubt a million times but.. this cheating act drove a wedge between us that I fear never will heal.  \n\n\nShe does not want me to ever masturbate, she isn't comfortable with me having a job or seeking a higher education. She is not comfortable with me having a phone. She is not okay with me being on the computer alone. She is constantly tripping out thinking I'm doing something wrong no matter what the situation is. She is younger than I and has virtually NO family support all ties are severed in that department except perhaps with her mom whom she literally never saw past childhood due to parental divorce and that woman and her family are all sorts of terrible.. both of her parents were heavy drug users of many substances and her dad ended up with custody and her mom ended up out of state. She never saw her until basically adulthood.   \n\n\nHowever, I am stuck in a difficult over-my-head situation. She has no license. We live off all the assistance you can get currently. My family, specifically father, has fronted the bill of all expenses for years for us. It's not fair to him. Our relationship issues should not keep me from being a working man. I would love to pursue a real job in some field that I enjoy. But I'm telling you I can't go to the store unattended without a large fight. She has all of my passwords to everything digital that I touch. This includes social media and games. I have allowed this type of behavior thinking it was being transparent but.. it's evolved into a hypercontrolling type of situation wherein even simply browsing normal reddit is scrutinized severely and often met with strong attitude.  \n\n\nMy social media messages to me from her are largely in part terrible hate mail. There is no sweetness left between us on there. We have definitely had our fair share of arguing in person I've tried to meet this increasing communist reminiscent lifestyle with resistance but each time it just results in disaster. Neither of us have any friends. She prefers it that way. They're all gone.  \n\n\nI live virtually. Through games, essentially. That's my social life. As you read this the information laid before you makes it appear as though my life is a big screaming match. No, I am passive mostly. I know fighting it just drags this shit out and we do have children in our home.. we have tried to stay together for their sake but as time goes on, even though I can keep it peaceful in our house through malicious compliance... it has become apparent that.. she hates me. She has no license. She has health issues, I'll give her that, like.. back problems and pains a lot. A severe infection took her down a rough road. She is considered medically frail.  \n\n\nBut she has no wish to ever work. No ambition. This is absolutely killing me. She has let herself go to a large extent, too.. health conditions aside.. she is huge now. I am an average decent looking dude. She is gaining weight and not slowing down. she refuses to eat right, refuses to work out.. it's bad. And with the way that she was raised.. her father essentially turned her and her siblings against the very idea of her mother. She luckily grew to think for herself later in life and has patched things up with her mom and met with her and even visited, alongside me, for as long as up to a month. Her mother appears somewhat normal but she's into.. still questionable activity that I wouldn't deem acceptable as an environment for my children such as smoking marijuana. As for any other substance god only knows. I would assume she likely at least does pills however often I do not know.  \n\n\nWith my girlfriend (we obviously never wed because of the trust issue she has severe aversion to it) being such a, for lack of a better word, dead beat... with no ambitions... it is a big fear that my kids will end up out of the state I reside in with my family. Far away from the family that has ALWAYS financially supported them and cared for them.. and living alongside her and her mom/her moms boyfriend who are quite frankly.. not suitable.  \n\n\nI'm left wondering what in the all hell am I to do. How do I escape this hell.. she hates me but we stay together.. I obviously don't love this anymore. As much as it pains me to say it as she berates me currently because I arranged for her to go to the doctor with a ride from a trusted family member.. I am not really in love with her anymore. I tried to make things right for years.  \n\n\nI don't want my kids ending up in that environment... but as far as anything I know.. I don't have a job right now and.. I don't have lawyer money.. The only money we have is provided via my dad to help care for my sons and live off of.. he can hardly spare a dime and he can't keep this up. We're unwed. As far as I can tell from all reports.. in the state of Indiana.. you have no right to your children as a man who is unwed during their birth and thereafter unless otherwise appointed in a court of law.  \n\n\nAnd the housing issues with the duo lease and.. everything. She is keeping me DOWN. I am stuck in child mode into my mid twenties having my dad handle so much shit for me when I need to be not catering to this suck-ass relationship and being a real adult like everyone else... I am scared to leave.   \n\n\nThere won't be another woman in my life.. nobody wants a dude with kids.. much less a dude with kids.. who has permanent disease. Everything is fucked.

It is my fault that he gets the way he does. And then he says that I am throwing therapy in his face.\n\nWe were supposed to go to mariatal therapy months ago. In fact it was part of the agreement for us to get back together. He used money as an excuse. But then said, after a raging night, that he is the problem and he needs to go himself. That if he was going. He wasnt going to pay for two therapies. I wasnt happy about it but what else is a SAHM going to do? I thought well it's a start. But it still bothered me that we didnt go to marriage counseling. \n\nI seriously have to wonder if it is because if we both go together, then suddenly I express my pain and my fears and then he looks bad. \n\nFurthremore, I have been 100% supportive of him going to therapy. Heck, I wish I could afford to go! I am a social worker, so it's obviously something I believe is a good thing. And it takes a lot for someone to admit they may need help. So while I am highly encouraging to him about it, he got into another fit today. Blew up. Got in my face over so.ethinf completely ridiculous. And when I asked him to act like he actually cares about me, I was told that I need to stop throwing therapy in his face. (As if I am doing that to begin with and second, as if I need to do X to get love in return). \n\nAnways, I told him after his first therapy session that I dont want to know what was said there. I want him to be able to go some place and feel safe to talk (God knows I want that for someone I care about because I have never felt safe speaking w him about almost anything of substance). So anyways, he told me a bunch of stuff that was said at therapy last week. Again, I told him he did not need to share. Well today he lashes out and then told me that therapy told him he needs to go home and chill and that I need to \"get off his back and out of his face\". This is almost every time I express any type of hurt or pain. \n\nThen he said get off my back about therapy! I'm like wait, what?! What are you talking about? He said that I need to stop and that he is in therapy for this stuff and basically implied that he can have fits and he can continue to mistreat me because he is \"working on it in therapy\". As if therapy is excuse to treat someone like complete crap. \n\nI guess I made my own bed being supportive.\nAnd now he thinks he can treat me like this and it is justified because he is working on it (and im.not. which couldnt be further from the truth!)

But the fun and loving guy that everyone knows and likes is someone I would be really sad to see go....the mean, harsh insensitivity guy, not so much. \n\nI am worried for my first children from my first marriage. I refuse to uproot them.and move again. I cant do that to them. I wont.

I am worried he will face the hardships that my husband has with his mother. And that he will project what he has on me, on our son.\n\nI am worried about flipping me and my childrens world upside down again. He literally threw us away twice in the last year. \n\nBut I cant take the mind games, the gaslighting. Not being emotionally present for my kids. I am burnt out. I cannot do anything else for this marriage. I will never ever be enough. \n\nMy question is, how do I sit him down and tell him about wanting to be done? He does one of three things. He either stonewalls and ignores me completely. Or he leaves and eventually comes back. (Less than hour). Or he gets infuriated and lashes out on me (he has anger issues). Is it possible to have a calm conversation? I dont know how to. He throws up his defenses asap and there is no solution.

Around here the courts favor the plaintiff. \n\nHow can I make this happen with the least amount of damage? I dont know how to step.

My mom never wanted kids. She made that very clear to me growing up, though she didn\u2019t tell me most of this until I was a teenager. A couple/few years before I was born, AM was engaged to a guy, who also didn\u2019t want to have kids. AM got pregnant with his baby and gave her something which messed up the pregnancy so bad, she had to get an abortion. She left him immediately after that. A couple years later, about 9 or so months before I was born, she met a little girl at a friend\u2019s child\u2019s birthday party. This girl told AM that she had no family, and AM was considering tracking down the girl and adopting her, but the girl left before she had a chance and no one knew who she was talking about, and she let it be.\n\nIn walks BD. They see each other around town. And have mutual friends at this wedding. He tries to rape her afterwards and she decides to take him home with her. I am the result. BD gets pissed that AM is pregnant, and tells her it\u2019s AM\u2019s fault and to deal with it herself. \n\nSeveral months after I am born, BD comes to visit me with his new girlfriend, and tries to talk about how I am his daughter. AM won\u2019t have any of it. They don\u2019t see each other again until I\u2019m 12, and this is the one time I actually remember meeting BD. (I was not impressed.)\n\nWhen I was a toddler, AM marries a different guy. I have no idea how they met, or how long they were dating before deciding to get married. She wanted me to have a dad, they got married and within months she is trying to get the marriage annulled. By this point, this guy had adopted me, and was trying to gain full custody. It wasn\u2019t until I brought up how he tried to take advantage of me that the courts finally grant AM full custody, and annulled the marriage and canceled the adoption. \n\nFor years, I thought AM could do no wrong, not when she was protecting her child like that. \n\n\n\nFast forward to the summer following my 8th birthday. AM was graduating with her masters. She would be able to have one decent job instead of several small ones. During the following school year, she finds her dream job at a school district 90 miles away from where I had grown up. She told me I wasn\u2019t allowed to tell my friends that I wouldn\u2019t be at the same school as them next year. This is when I notice her starting to become abusive. In my teens I can pinpoint this as her turning point. Looking back, I think AM was just acting better than everyone for finishing her masters program. That\u2019s when she started to scream at me for hours on end. When I was 8, AM would snap out of it fast and ask why I was crying. By the time I was 12, there was no escape to her torture. I was being screamed at that I was a \u201clazy, worthless, piece of shit\u201d for hours at a time for the most pointless things. Not watering the gardening because I had been focusing on my schoolwork (by the time I was an 8th grader, I was a homeschool student, teaching myself from home because she was at work every day.) Not folding the towels correctly because she decided to change how we were going to fold them and not tell me. That I wasn\u2019t helping enough around the house because she was too busy working to do anything else and expected me to do it, again without telling me. \n\nStupid stuff like that. \n\nBut I still didn\u2019t think I was being abused. AM never hit me at this point in time. She only hit me once or twice in my teens, and one of them left a mark for a few hours from her ring. \n\n\nEven when 3 of my good friends from scouts, church, and martial arts spoke out about being sexually abused by their stepdad and our sensei, who was also a sheriff, though not for domestic abuse, took the case because they knew and trusted him, I still didn\u2019t think I was being abused. Our sensei was really starting to look at all of his students, most of whom were female and between the ages of 10-15, and he wanted us to know that the world sucked, that there are terrible people, and that he wanted us to properly defend ourselves. And when I needed that training the most, it failed me. \n\nWhen I was about 14, my sensei was really starting to pay attention to me. He could tell something was up. There were many days I skipped class because I couldn\u2019t stop crying and was being told to shape up and \u201cwipe that ugly look off my face\u201d. AM claimed she was \u201cpreparing me for the world\u201d. My sensei pulled me off to the side one night before class. He could tell I was upset, but I refused to talk about it. I claimed everything was fine. I knew kids put in the system and taken away from their families. My closest family member was nearly 1000 miles away. I wasn\u2019t sure where I would be sent if what was going on was found out. \n\n\n\nIn my mid teens, I knew that I could count on my best friend for anything. I was 13 and she was 10 when we met through a local youth group. She also lived a few blocks from me, so we would hang out quite frequently. By the time I was 15, BFF had seen my mom in action, but AM had stopped because she didn\u2019t want anything to get out. My BFF didn\u2019t say anything. But she could tell if I was having a bad day and would be at my house in a heartbeat. I didn\u2019t need to call or text. It got to the point when she was at my house every few days. On the weekends, we go to the local playground and hang out on the swings or play basketball. At one point, we joked about getting an apartment together (I was around 17 at that point and had my first job) to get away from my horrible mom and her ok grandma. \n\n\n\nWhen I was 15, my teacher/school advisor noticed something was up. I was homeschooled, but worked with a charter school to get credit for high school. I went in once a week and showed her what I had accomplished. \n\nAt this point I was going through a bit of a rebellious streak, rebellious for me anyway. I grew my hair out (before being told that I must curl it or no longer live in her house). Growing up, I wasn\u2019t allowed to wear anything which could be considered an advertisement. The only things with and kind of print/logo were floral, a couple holiday inspired shirts/pants (candy canes, bats, etc), and a shirt with a butterfly on in. This was when I started to wear shirts with Disney and Pixar characters on them. I started to enjoy music and films my mom had either never heard of or didn\u2019t like. Sure, I liked a lot of things from when I was little, but there were others I was no longer interested (or being forced to like) and I was being forced to \u201cenjoy\u201d. She was also taking me to bigger live theatre productions 90 miles away in the town I grew up in. There were a couple I was generally interested in, but most weren\u2019t my thing and I was forced into going. And shows that I liked, but she didn\u2019t, had no chance of us seeing them. \n\nMost of the time, I didn\u2019t care. When I was 15, she lost her job with the school district and AM was either yelling at me constantly, or locking herself in her room and ignoring me for many hours. I didn\u2019t know how to really cook at this point in time, so most nights like that were spent eating Spagettios, canned soup, or frozen dinners. \n\nAM was very particular about us going to anything with culture. On this day, a local orchestra was performing one of her favorite pieces of music. It\u2019s good, sure, but not my favorite. I was not a fan and never went out of my way to listen to it. Of course, AM went into her rant of \u201cworthless\u201d, \u201cdoesn\u2019t know anything about culture\u201d and such. As always, I could not stop crying. No matter how much I tried. Because people would be there. Maybe people we knew. People would talk. \n\nI couldn\u2019t jeopardize what little I had. She had already threatened to kick me out/send me to grandma\u2019s if I didn\u2019t obey her. \n\nOf course, my teacher saw that I was crying and was sympathetic towards me. This only made me feel worse. I kept trying to be independent, because that\u2019s what I had been told to be. I rarely asked questions/asked for help because I wouldn\u2019t receive it. \n\nAgain, I refused to talk about what was going on. AM had been parking the car while I had been talking with my teacher and came up to us as I was in tears and my teacher\u2019s hand was on my shoulder. AM was pissed. And I felt horrible for it. \n\nThat was the time in my life I woke up everyday wondering how much of a disappointment I would be to her that day. Nothing I did was good enough for her. Even if it was related to something she liked, it would never be as wonderful as she was. \n\n(I\u2019m sure someone is going to point out that this was probably my fault, but I was sick of her controlling me and forcing me to go to these things, and refusing to hear otherwise.)\n\n\n\nOne of her favorites to go to in my teens was \u201cwell if you want to be a whore who sells her body for a place to sleep at night!\u201d Seriously, I don\u2019t know where she came up with some of this stuff. \n\n\n\nI graduated high school when I was 16 after 2.5 years of school. The following spring I turned 17, and she met my stepdad, the nice one. They were married a month after they met, if you can call it that. I still have to lie to my grandma, the one family member I still talk to on a regular basis, about how wonderful their wedding was. In a little church, upriver, in the mountains (in his family\u2019s cabin, upriver, in the mountains); the church burned down soon after (it was in front of the fireplace); I was their witness (I was asleep when they \u201cexchanged vows\u201d, no documents were ever signed). \n\nHe is a good person though. I learned a lot more than him about cooking and how to manage your finances in the couple years we lived together than in the almost 20 I lived with my mom. I still consider him to be one of my father figures, even though we only interacted in those few years. (The others being my grandfather, my godfather, and Sheriff Sensei.) And I want to think that he thought of me as his daughter. I was 17 when they got married and AM asked if I wanted him to adopt me. At the time, I said no, and I may have offended him by it. Though he had a previous marriage, neither him nor his younger brother had any kids. \n\nWhen I was 17, I also started my first job. I helped pay food and any odd bills during the second half of the month. AM had found a part time job. NSD has found something, which though not full time, helped a lot. \n\nAfter I turned 18, I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to do. I liked my job, and didn\u2019t want to change it. I thought about going to school, but I didn\u2019t have the money for it. AM told me to apply for financial aid and scholarships like she had taught me. (She never had). I needed tax information from her to apply for FA. (She refused to provide it.) \n\nI decided that I needed some time to figure things out without her. I moved to my grandparents\u2019 house for a year. They were getting older (85 and 90 at the time) and could use someone younger helping them. Both AM and I had lived with them while she was doing student teaching while I was in 1st grade. AM had never understood that I LOVE my grandparents, especially my grandma, but they also live somewhere where it\u2019s very hot and crowded. They live about an hour from the beach (in one direction), an hour from the mountains (in the other), but between them in all cement. I was barely allowed to go down the street to the library and YMCA on my own. Grandma always wanted to know where I was going, when I was leaving, and when I was returning. I had no friends.\n\n\n\nThis was the point in time when my 1st cousin, once removed came to live with us. She was under the age of ten and had been placed in the foster system because her mother (ex-wife of my cousin) was a drug addict and was neglecting her child. I helped this girl with school work. I take her to the library and sometimes we get a ride to the local amusement park.\n\nAnd one day it all came crashing down. \n\nI had been helping her with an assignment and since she wasn\u2019t helping that much, I told her that I had done all the work when it was finished. It was the same thing my mom had said to me over and over. She was stunned. I burst into tears, knelt down to her level, gave her a it hug and apologized to her. I made sure she understood I would never do that again. \n\nI have never gotten upset like that since. \n\nI have been mad. \n\nI have been upset and pissed off. \n\nBut I have never yelled at anyone since.\n\nI still feel terrible about doing that, and after explaining what happened, over 3 years later, she understood and forgave me for it. \n\n\n\nWhen I was 19, I decided to move back in with my parents. I still had no idea what I really wanted to do with my life, but I loved my part time job, and I was only 19, I had plenty of time to figure it out!\n\nAt first it was, can you help contribute? It doesn\u2019t have to be much. It doesn\u2019t have to be often. \u00a0\n\nSure, I had a little savings. I could help here and there.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize how bad it was at first. They had sold the house and moved to another state. (They didn\u2019t get much from the house.) NSD\u2019s parents were helping a lot too. My grandparents were helping quite a bit also. After I got a new job, in the next town over, (which had so few hours I only worked about 6 hours over 2 days a week,) I started helping as well. By this point, I was also volunteering with a local Girl Scout troop. I had grown up in and loved the program. I\u2019m still with this troop, still working on badges with them, though I don\u2019t have to sell many cookies anymore (though not for the reasons AM listed below). \n\nI volunteered at the local library as well. You could find me there almost every day. \n\nThere was a small, one screen movie theatre in town, and a bookshop next door. \n\nI was staying somewhat busy. \n\n\n\nAfter a year, I started working in town instead of the next town over. I got a lot more hours, I actually had a paycheck for once. I started riding the bike everywhere, and stopped taking the bus as much as I didn\u2019t own the car and was therefore not allowed to drive it. \n\nThis was when AM stopped really caring. I was now expected to pay for everything I could, especially to help start up her small business idea. I had made it clear from the moment I walked back into her house, I was not interested in this project. I would not help finance it.\n\nThe \u201cit doesn\u2019t have to be much or often\u201d was no longer what I thought it was. The only things I wasn\u2019t paying for was rent on their building and the water bill. \n\nThat\u2019s the other thing I need to point out. I had no privacy there, which is why I spent as much time away as possible. They had rented a converted warehouse. My \u201croom\u201d was in the corner, near the back door, two of mywalls were made of bookcases and curtains. \n\nAt least NSD would \u201cknock\u201d if the curtains were closed and ask to pass through to the back patio. AM would walk in whenever. Would continue to criticize me as I was resting because I wasn\u2019t working enough to take care of the family. \n\nI was 21 when it hit me. As long as I stayed with her, it would never be my life, only hers.\n\nBy this point the honeymoon stage had also ended for her marriage. If AM was yelling at me, and NSD tried to stop it or point out what she was doing, she would turn her anger on him. The same thing would happen if I point out that she was yelling at him, and as always, it was about the stupidest things. \n\nYou aren\u2019t cutting potatoes right. \n\nI don\u2019t want to eat cream based sauces, you make them to much, and I\u2019ll get fat. (She was fat when I was little and weirdly skinny in my teens, she could put on a few pounds and be fine.) \n\nWe pointed out multiple times to her face that this is how she was acting and it was not ok to treat people like this. \n\nShe would then switch to baby talk and mock us for standing up to her. \n\n\nI pointed out many times that I had no privacy and the least she could do was knock if she wanted to talk/pass through when my curtains were down, just like NSD. She refused. \n\n\nI talked to my few friends at work. My paychecks were made out to me, my bank account was in my name only. \n\nShe insisted that NSD kept my debit card in his wallet. She insisted that my paychecks were not mine and that they were instead \u201cfamily money\u201d. At one point she said, \u201cif you want to pay rent so badly, you\u2019re going to need to get another job. Because I\u2019ll start charging you rent so high, you won\u2019t be able to afford it.\u201d\n\nI started putting as much away as I could. I asked my bosses if I could keep a couple boxes in the staff room. I tried to take what was the most important. Spare clothing, older scout books (left the uniforms), high school diploma. I kept my few pieces of jewelry locked in my locker. \n\n\n\nDecember 2016, I received a new debit card in the mail. I asked NSD if I could hold onto it from now on and have him take me on shopping trips. I changed the password as soon as I got it. Something AM or NSD would never guess. \n\nA phone had been left for over a month in lost and found at my facility. It was prepaid. The office manager had it unlocked and given it to me. I changed the number and started adding a few contacts in, mostly coworkers. \n\nI started searching for a room to rent. I couldn\u2019t take this for much longer. \n\n\n\nJanuary 2017, NSD travels about an hour away once a week to take care of his aging parents. I tell him the day before that I found a place and plan to look at it the next day (when NSD is out of town). NSD wishes I had told him sooner but understands. He got a part time job a couple months prior and was trying to take over the bills anyway. I ask him to keep AM occupied for a few hours the following weekend while I move out, if I like the place. \n\nThe next night I tell AM that I may need to stay late at work. By this point she insisted to know where I was at all times, to text her when I was leaving one place or another. Instead, I got around the corner and see the room to rent. Descent neighborhood, near work, the roommate (who was there) seemed fine. Right price. Could move in on the weekend. (Ended up being the following night.)\n\nI go back to her place and finish packing the last of my things. (Mostly scout uniforms and the last of my clothing.) I plan to take them to work in the morning, during an early shift that she is never up for when I leave. \n\nAM confronts me. \n\nShe throws my dresser over, not large or heavy, but it shatters the cookie jar my scout leader got me for Christmas, less than a month before. \n\nShe starts screaming that I have no right to move out. \n\nI point out that I have been a legal adult for almost 4 years (my birthday was in about 2.5 months).\n\nShe claims I have no money to move out. \n\nI point out that I have a job and legally all money I make from it is mine. \n\nShe pushes me to the ground and climbs on top of me. Like I mentioned before, she had only actually hit me twice, though she would fake it sometimes to point out that my martial arts wouldn\u2019t help me in an actual situation. \n\nShe was kinda right. \n\nIn martial arts, we practiced someone grabbing near your shoulder (backpack strap, breasts), someone punching or stabbing you, someone shooting you point blank with a gun, a knife/sword/stick crashing on top of your head, someone grabbing you from behind, someone grabbing your wrists.\n\nWe never practiced someone climbing on top of you and holding you down. \n\nMy hands were pinned down at my sides, under her legs. I was trapped. \n\nI remember hearing two voices in my head as AM pounded my head into the floor. The quiet one telling me to let go. And the slightly louder one telling me to not give up the fight. \n\nI was struggling to keep my head off the floor, but I can tell you, the MRI I got earlier this year showed no structural damaged. I have no idea how I survived. \n\n\nShe finally left me on the ground and stood up. I lost all energy to try and fight with her, there was no point. \n\n\nShe kicked me out that night, wearing only the clothes I had on, my purse, and my Girl Scout bag. \n\nAM made me leave the debit card. At least I knew she couldn\u2019t use it before I cancelled it the next day. \n\n\nI wandered down the street on that cold January night. I knew approximately where one of my work friends lived down the road from me. Not the exact house, but luckily she answered the door when I called out for her. \n\nThis coworker took me in and calmed me down. After about an hour, we called the police. I regret not pressing charges. I regret waiting another two days to seek medical attention because the headache still hadn\u2019t gone away and was told \u201cyou have a minor concussion. Take some ibuprofen. You\u2019re fine.\u201d I regret not taking this to small claims court. \n\nI regret not getting a restraining order against this woman. \n\n\nThe cops said, \u201cif you aren\u2019t going to press charges, we can only ask for her to give you her stuff back.\u201d \n\nI understood. \n\nAM then lied to the cops saying \u201cshe wanted to move out. I have nothing that belongs to that girl.\u201d\n\n\n\nI started using the new phone. Blocked her on the old and new phones. Talked to my grandma a little. Changed my phone number again when AM kept contacting me. Until I got an entirely new phone on a new plan with a new number that May. \n\n\nAM contacted my scout leader over Facebook that night, claiming that I had embezzled money from her and that I better not be allowed to sell cookies because then I would steal from the troop. My scout leader never responded to her and asked me about it later. Her response was \u201cI had no idea that was going on. I knew it didn\u2019t sound like you. You did the right thing.\u201d\n\n\nI have blocked her on Facebook numerous times. I have blocked her number on multiple phones, with varying degrees of success. I recently found that my iPhone will still accept voicemails from blocked numbers but won\u2019t alert you. AM had left 3 in the past 6 months. I deleted them without listening to them. \n\n\nIt\u2019s been two years since the last time I saw her. My grandma is constantly worried about me because I live over an hour away from any family members (they moved closer to NSD\u2019s parents 2 summers ago, I moved to another town about 6 months ago) and therefore no one can check on me if I\u2019m in trouble. For almost two years my grandma kept saying \u201cyour mom misses you so much\u201d and \u201chow could a mother do that to her daughter\u201d and \u201cyou should make up and move back with her. I hate to see my family mad at each other.\u201d\n\nLike I said earlier. I love my grandma, but she\u2019s 95 now, and doesn\u2019t have as good as a memory as she used to. It wasn\u2019t until I had been on my own for a year that she realized I was 12 anymore. She doesn\u2019t understand when I tell her all the pain this woman has put me through. No one does. \n\nSome try. \n\nOne (my boyfriend who I met after I moved out) knows what happens and hates AM for everything she has done to me. \n\nI\u2019ve gone to 3 different therapists in the last year. They tell me I shouldn\u2019t dwell on the past, or that I need to focus on my problems in the present as I\u2019m begging them to help me work through this. \n\nOne of my friends said that it would be better to focus on my problems in the present that they can help me work through my past issues. The only comments they\u2019ll give when I explain my nightmares to them, that AM is forcing me to work for her/run her business/do everything for her and not be allowed to live my own life, is that they are illogical and I don\u2019t need to think like that. They don\u2019t care that I have between 1-4 in a week!\n\n\n\nMy doctor is sympathetic. She\u2019s trying to help as I\u2019m showing signs of depression and my headaches are making it hard to focus and do almost anything. \n\nI\u2019ll be 24 next month, and even with everything I\u2019ve done in the past, (Gold Award, PHQ, PWA, Red Cross Trainer) I still don\u2019t feel ready to be considered an adult. It\u2019s hard for me to tell how much of a childhood I had and how long I spent in limbo. \n\nI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going from here. I love my job and occupational field. I love working with my scout troop. I love my boyfriend and my few friends, mostly from work and the new facility I started working at last fall.\n\nI just don\u2019t know what else I could have done. There\u2019s no helping someone who refuses to help themself. There\u2019s no helping someone who thinks they can hurt those they are closest too.\n\nI have no feelings towards AM. If I think about how she treated me, then I get emotional. But her as a person? Grandma has told me she\u2019s complaining about everything and wants to leave my NSD. If she did, or if I was to randomly get a phone call saying she had died, I would feel nothing towards her.\n\nI feel bad for my NSD. He most likely became her full time victim after I left. And that sucks. He didn\u2019t know exactly what she was like when they got together, but did within the first few months. He has tried (always unsuccessfully) to stop her from hurting me, but over time, we noticed she would always flip her rage to the person who tried to get involved. We both had to stop helping each other, and for that I am truly sorry. You don\u2019t deserve that. \n\nNo one deserves that. \n\n", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I have felt absolutely insane trying to figure out our roller coaster of a relationship, so when I finally found an article about NPD- it clicked. I felt like, in a way, my concerns had been validated. \n\nA little back story, I got back together with my Nex after a year of us splitting. When we split, it was BAD. He cheated, gaslighted me, and made me feel so small. I got back together with him because his brother passed in September of 2017. We started talking again and he said the event changed him. He said he realized he was wrong and wanted to treat me like I deserve. I gave him a second chance.\n\nFast forward, we\u2019ve been together long distance for a year and a half. Until (around) December I honestly thought he was different, but then he started acting cold. I thought maybe the holidays were upsetting him because of his brother so I tried to ignore it. I moved in with him at the beginning of February and nothing changed. It was small things. Snarky comments about everything I do, not saying thank you, no expression when I talked or was excited, dropping doors in my face, just overall being inconsiderate. \n\nI found out he\u2019s been cheating (again) two weeks ago. I know EVERYTHING. All the online dating accounts, the hookups, I found out the extent of it all (well, enough so). He\u2019s been doing it the entirety of our relationship. Ever since I called him out he\u2019s been horrible x1000. If I cry about it I\u2019m \u201ca negative weight pulling him down\u201d.

I am unsure how I let myself back into this relationship again. It was like one day a flip switched and suddenly he treated me horribly. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can take this. \n\nDo you guys think I\u2019m actually am unattractive to him or bad in bed or is this something Narcs do to retaliate?

I believe that after a lot of studying. I've been told that I'm in a relationship with a narcissist. After studying that I agree with that as well.\nMy relationship has a lot of ups and downs and I am the giving and affectionate one, she can be affectionate at times however only seems to be that way if she wants something or scared im going to leave. More often then not my partner is the controlling and manipulative one who demands money from me and submission to her needs, demands and to agree with everything she thinks and says. There are times i hear her talk about others and it's disturbing. She has no sympathy for anyone. It's oddly disturbing. She's scolded me for helping homeless people she's lectured me for helping the underdogs. She's appalled by me taking time to help people in my life who have depression issues and addiction issues, saying they are selfish scum and that they deserve to feel bad. She does what she wants, barely gives me anything unless I'm ready to leave. I'm really disturbed by her lack of care or concern for people who are suffering. She seems to be that way due to having a horrible alcoholic mother, or so she says that's why she seems to hate the world. She's so negative, she always complains and thinks the world is against her. We are polar opposites. She was different in the beginning. Now her true side has shown. I cannot sway her to see my side as to why i care for people. She says all the people I help don't deserve it and that they are just using me. \nWe often go through periods of constant arguments due to her controlling nature. She doesn't want me having friends, she is suspicious when I haven't given her a reason to be other then talking to a friend she doesn't like and then getting \"caught\" doing so. She doesn't like my best friend and makes it a condition that I don't talk to her and when I do all hell breaks loose. The odd thing is she has no right to tell me not to talk to my best friend, she just jealous and insecure. I find it hard to leave this relationship because I believe I am codependent and empathic. I feel bad for her. Also because she has alienated me from everyone over time I have no one if I do leave her and if I'mt good at being alone for extended periods of time. I feel doomed. I've heard empaths and narcissist relationships are beyond toxic. I'm so scared to leave at times I'll endure massive amounts of emotional abuse, such as her withholding love and affection and even creating a fight when I try to be affectionate out of know where. Does anyone have advice on how to leave and recover a relationship like this? Has anyone actually done it without major trauma? Do narcissists literally find ways to push buttons and manipulate their partner. Why don't they feel bad about how they treat people? Do they have actual emotions or are they fake? I don't understand how people can be like this. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

During this time, he was traveling for work and would take the videos to Florida. Apparently this happened a few times when I was living with my mother and my step dad after I graduated college. \n\nMy mom was the one who originally found out that my step dad was video taping me in the bathroom. She was snooping through his emails and found a receipt for a hidden camera. She confronted him about it and he admitted to it. She then told me. She also kicked him out of the house and wanted to get away from him.\n\nOriginally she wanted me to report him to the police. However, her tune started to change over a few days. She started to tell me that she didn\u2019t think it was the best decision to go to the police because if my step dad went to jail, he\u2019d kill him self. She then told me that if he killed him self, it would be my fault. At that point, I could see through her manipulation and realized that she was spending more time with my step dad again. I still reported him to the police.\n\nDuring this time, my mother is still telling me that she wants to get away from him even though she\u2019s talking to him every day, seeing him almost everyday, and going to marriage counseling with him. She tells me that she wants to move into one of her townhouses and she wants me to live with her. I agree to this and we start to move. I eventually move into her townhouse. Over two months, she\u2019s still moving her things into the townhouse but she never physically moves in. She\u2019s still living at the old house and she invited her husband to move back in with her. \n\nAfter realizing that she\u2019s probably not moving in and feeling as though she\u2019s putting on a show, I decide to talk to her. She basically tells me that my step dad is the love her life, her best friend, and she needs to be there for him to help him through his \u2018sex addiction\u2019. I remind her that he\u2019s not the victim, but the abuser. I also reminded her that I was violated, and I would have appreciated it if she was more supportive. At that point, I\u2019m told that I\u2019m a bitch and she wanted me out of the town house for a few hours because my step dad was coming by to pick up her stuff. I told her that my step dad had no business being at the town house. She then tells me that since she owns the property, she can do whatever she wants and have whoever she wants over. \n\nAbout a week after that conversation, my mother calls me to let me know that my great uncle had died. She also told me that she wanted me out of the townhouse in a week and she didn\u2019t care where I went. After that drama, I moved to the west coast.\n\nAfter everything that has happened, I never want to see my step dad again. As for my mother, I have lost trust and respect for her. From what I\u2019m told by my grandmother, my mom still brings my step dad to family events. I do not attend these events since I now live 2,000 miles away. It sucks because my family knows about what happened, but they still invite my step dad into the family. Additionally, no one in my family has stuck up for me through out this whole thing. Over this past year, I\u2019ve been feeling as though I\u2019ve been abandoned by my family. As for the police, the investigation is still on going.\n", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I had a bad coke habit and found a new dealer that I thought was really cute. We started hanging  out and within 2 or 3 weeks I moved in with him. He introduced me to a world I had never seen before and I was so infatuated. A world that was so troubled and dark and messed up but there was something about it .. about him that I couldn\u2019t shake. \n\nHe revealed to me in the 2nd week we were dating that he had kidnapped 2 people (a guy and a girl) that he thought stole something from him at a party at his house the night before. They had fallen asleep and in the morning he held a gun to them and told them to get in the car. He drove them 2 hours out into the middle of a desert in Utah and left them there alone. He was planning to kill them and then couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it, and left them stranded.\n\nAt the time I guess I thought I wanted to help him. I wanted him to love me and let me in.\n\nAbout a month later, I was having a hard time and felt suicidal. We sat on his bed and I cried, saying how I didn\u2019t see the light at the end of the tunnel and how maybe I\u2019m not meant to be on this Earth. He said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t say something like that if you\u2019re not gonna do it. Don\u2019t be a pussy. Kill yourself. Here.\u201d And put a loaded machine gun in my hands yelling \u201cFucking do it!!!!!!\u201d\n\nTwo months later, were having sex. He had a phone out, I thought he was taking pictures as that was a regular thing. He started laughing this demonic laugh. I looked back at him. He was going through my texts and saw an old text calling someone \u201cBabe.\u201d He threw a metal chair at me and loaded his Scorpion machine gun with hollow points and said \u201cThere\u2019s so many things I could do to you right now.\u201d For some reason as I sat on the edge of the bed I repeated to him what he said to me. \u201cDon\u2019t say something like that if you\u2019re not gonna do it. Don\u2019t be a pussy.\u201d Looking back I don\u2019t know why on earth I would say that. He took the safety off and aimed it at my head. All the sudden I jumped up off the bed and started screaming for any of his roommates. He had 5. Only one woke up. We were wrestling for the gun when our friend came in. After that night the friend acted like he had no one what I was talking about. The roommate took his side.\n\nFast forward a year, I move him out to live with me in a different state. His behavior didn\u2019t change. Cheated dozens of times. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to leave him because he would have been homeless with no money and no job. I was working 3 jobs to support us while he played Xbox all day. \n\n5-7 times I woke up in the middle of the night to getting punched and/or slapped in the face. He would say it was an accident and that he did it in his sleep, and would never say sorry. I would cover up the bruises on my cheekbones and not say anything.\n\nHis phone rang at 11:57pm, his friend was calling. It started him and he hit me in the face. I got mad, and he went back to sleep. He started snoring super loud and I asked him to turn over so he\u2019d stop. He did turn over, but proceeded to strangle me with both hands. Time slowed down, my vision was going blurry. I thought I was about to die. But all the sudden something in me got a burst of adrenaline and I threw my legs up and started kicking him as hard as I could in the neck. It knocked the wind out of him and he fell back. I had bruises around my throat for a week. No one ever knew. And I was working at a treatment center.\n\nI finally got the courage to break up with him when I met another man who treated me better than I ever thought I deserved. This man treated me like he loved me. I now know that he didn\u2019t treat me like he loved me, but that he treated me the way a normal man treats a woman. Respectfully, kindly.. I never thought I would feel the way I do now. I\u2019m not scared. I don\u2019t flinch when he pushes a piece of hair out of my face or when he reaches for an eyelash. \n\nI should be dead, but instead I\u2019m here, living and happy. I feel alive.\n\nI never pressed charges against him. He seems to have turned his life around, he\u2019s sober now. Recently I\u2019ve been thinking about it thought and  I\u2019m scared that he\u2019s going to hurt someone or even kill someone. His anger is incredible. It\u2019s terrifying.

More like the spawn of Satan...", "author": "MadameDeWolfe", "self_text": "I'm not exactly sure where to put this but I feel like my story fits best under this category. It's somewhat long but I hope you all don't mind.\n\nA bit of background before I begin. (Trust me this is all relevant.) I had recently turned 18 in October and I had passed an interview for my first official job at a small local amusement park. Prior to this, I had been totally homeschooled and knew little to nothing about how people behave in a work setting. Nonetheless, I was a relatively quick learner and had a gift for reading people. I thought I would be okay. I was sooo wrong.\n\nThis all happened less than a year ago, at the start of summer. It was the first week of training and another new hire and myself were shown around by the manager in charge of training (he is not the main character but is still important to the story). This manager, let's call him Charles, explained the orders of operation, and the first few days of training went on without a hitch. I knew I would definitely love working there for sure.\n\nThen comes my first official shift with the devil's son himself, we can call him Joseph. Joseph was handsome, to say the least, charming and quick-witted. We hit it off almost as soon as my shift started. Since \"summer hours\" had started, the park was busy and there wasn't much time to actually talk, we resorted to texting back and forth over the course of my shift. Note: this wasn't a red flag to me because we had no other way to keep in contact with the managers/other coworkers. As weeks went by, he started to request me to be on his shift and I was happy to oblige because I enjoyed his attention and being as innocent as I was, I could see no wrong in him.\n\nI became close with Joseph and with Charles as well, who was best friends with Joseph at the time. Those days working on the same shift with Joseph and Charles were the best days of my life, and even still I miss those days very much. Joseph and I started texting outside of work and I grew very affectionate towards him, pouring out my heart to him like the silly naive girl I was. He urged me to confide in him and I was happy to oblige, of course.\n\nThere started to be days where the park was neither busy nor was there work to be done. Joseph would pull me to the side and we would go and talk about anything for hours on end. He would seem genuinely interested in my life and hardships.\n\nHe also became more flirtatious. I would feel his eyes on me often (watching me walk past, staring at me as I worked, glancing at me as he was talking to someone else, etc). He would tease me, poke me, pet my head like you would a little dog, and hug me too. Our texts became more charged and full of sexual tension. He would talk about how he wanted me and what he wished he could do to me. And I soaked up all this attention like a sponge. All in all, not appropriate for a manager/subordinate relationship, nor how anyone should act towards someone who was six years your junior.\n\nCharles was the only one who spotted how Joseph was towards me and he came to me concerned. He warned me not to get too close to Joseph. I got defensive, saying he wasn't as bad as Charles thought. It was then that I was informed that he not only had a child (I already knew this) and lived with his parents still (also knew this), but that his baby-momma and HER two children lived with him.\n\nI was shocked of course, but I mostly felt betrayed. Why would he give me this attention yet sleep in the same bed with someone else? I confronted him about it and he \"broke down\" explaining how his \"ex\" was abusive and he stayed with her for his kid's sake. He had lost some of my trust but I was still eager to forgive him. Things went back to how the way they were for a while.\n\nThat was until I found out that he was also giving the same kind of attention to another female coworker, who happened to be only a year older than I was. This entire time he had led me on, making me feel special, making me believe that I was the only person he cared about. As I picked to pieces what he had been doing, I became more and more creeped out. I started to see how controlling he had become of me, telling me what to think, how to act, what to say. He would hide things from me, turn issues back onto me, and make me feel like I was the person at fault. He had put a leash on me and I became his little pet, loyal and obedient. He took advantage of how naive I was and made me his little plaything. I became scared of him, closed off and short with him, avoiding his advances, avoiding being alone with him, and ignoring his texts.\n\nWhen he knew that he couldn't get me to do anything anymore, he became cruel towards me. He would play favorites in front of me, always giving his \"favorite\" the easy jobs, and letting them sit around without scolding them. He started to make me feel like crap and nitpick everything I did. I was so loyal to him, despite what he did to me, that I would crawl back to him and ask for forgiveness. He would become my \"friend\" again until I came to my senses and cut him off again. No matter what I did, I was stuck in this looping love/hate relationship with Joseph. It got so bad that I started to fall back onto my old habit of self-harm, and spend endless nights crying. He would always comfort me, make me feel better than throw me down again. I lost the love I had for that job, I became a shell of who I was.\n\nOne day after a particularly hard day of abuse from both customers and Joseph, I had enough. I had enough of his emotional abuse. I had enough of feeling like I wasn't enough. I became fed up with the control he had over me and how he made me feel like I was nothing without him. I had to face the fact that he was abusing me and that he was the worst person for me in every way. I mustered up every ounce of courage I had and I put in my two weeks. As soon as my last shift came, blocked him from my phone. Finally, I was free.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I'm scared people won't believe me, because I barely believed it myself for months. I'm sure you guys can relate. What I let myself go through for the sake of \"love\" and \"patience\" and \"healing and helping my brave boyfriend who's been through so much\" still amazes me. I feel deep shame about it, because it was such degrading treatment. I still sometimes feel like it was all some bad dream that I'm still struggling to wake up from and keep going back into. (Perhaps it is.)\n\nI think my story traumatized the therapist, haha.  Don't think she'd ever heard a story like mine in her practice. She literally shuttered, gasped and leaned forward in her chair when I told her some of the specifics, and her eyes got really round.\n\nNormally these arrangements take 3-5 sessions for the therapists to determine where to refer someone out, but she already approved me for referral after just one session. I'm having another appointment tomorrow to finalize the process.\n\nI requested EMDR for the damage to my amygdala, PTSD testing, personality disorder testing (just to be safe), codependency assessment, and any and all testing for mental illness that was appropriate to run. I also requested to be referred to a professional or professionals who are familiar with NPD and ASPD, and the effects of that type of abuse.

I shared in an off-the-cuff way that I sometimes felt like revisiting my story with a new person made me act a little crazy-- my eyes get big, I fixate on the wall, I stutter, and I nitpick at my clothes, pillows on a couch, whatever's nearby. I apologized if I came off as crazy. She shook her head and said, \"I don't see a crazy woman in front of me. I see a woman who has been abused and deeply traumatized.\" Hearing that made me cry.\n\nAt the end of the session she sat back in her chair. She'd been leaning forward, fully engrossed by my story. \"Wow,\" she said quietly. \"Well, it's clear that you're a very strong person, and you're very resourceful. I want you to know that you're going to be okay.\"\n\nYes, *I'm strong, and I'm going to be okay.* Those are the same words I said to my ex when he asked with a smirk if I was going to commit suicide over him breaking my heart.\n\nNope. I'm strong and I'm gonna be okay.\n\nI'm excited to be honest! It feels like progress for the first time in several weeks. I'll keep you guys updated.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

However, I grew up being emotionally and sexually abused by my best friend. We were friends from age 3/4 to age 15. We had a really weird friendship; it was unhealthily close (when I've described it to my therapist, she's commented that it sounds more like a romantic/sexual relationship than a friendship....a very unhealthy one, obviously). She did all kinds of things to manipulate and abuse me, such as going through my stuff (clothes, phone, etc.) and criticizing anything she found that she didn't like, making fun of me for having any interests that didn't align with hers, etc. (There was a lot more abuse, but I don't remember it all and it's not relevant.)\n\nI always thought my PTSD began after I ended our relationship in 2015. I started getting panic attacks, nightmares, dissociating (although I was somewhat unaware of that, and that was likely happening throughout my childhood)...a lot of the typical symptoms. But now that I'm thinking about it, I remember being really paranoid and anxious during our friendship. I was constantly on edge around her because I wanted to be perfect or else she'd make me feel worthless. This is really weird, but the reason I'm writing this post is because I remember having this irrational fear that I was being watched with cameras in my house...like maybe my parents had put them up and were spying on me. Like I said, my parents weren't abusive and wouldn't do that. It sounds insane and I knew it was crazy, but I'm wondering if that fear/feeling of being watched came from my abuser always going through my stuff and feeling like I couldn't hide from her.

I was in a long Narc relationship for so long I honestly can\u2019t tell what is normal in a relationship because I am used to being ignored and given the silent treatment. \n\nIf this guy is a Narc he is definitely a different kind of Narc than my Ex. \n\nSome of things he\u2019s said and done have set off red flags in my mind, just from some of the narc videos I\u2019ve watched. I am trying to learn to listen to my intuition more. \n\nI wanted your opinions of whether he could be a narc? \n\n1. He said \u201cI like control\u201d verbatim. I\u2019m not kidding. He was referring to the bedroom but I found out that he was actually bossy in other areas. He would say things like... you should eat this, or \u201ceat your food\u201d in a joking but not joking sort of way, or don\u2019t bring your wallet you might lose it, or he would try to tell me where to stand or sit. He would always insist on paying (if I did happen to pay he wouldn\u2019t get mad though). He would always insist on driving and would not let me drive at all. But you know... some people are just bossy right? \n\n2. He bought me flowers (for Valentine\u2019s Day) left with a sappy card but we had only been talking like literally less than a month. AND we both agreed from the very beginning we didn\u2019t want anything serious. \n\n3. If I told him I liked certain music or a certain artist the next time I got in his car, he would be playing it. (Is that just being nice?) \n\n4. He would say things like... \u201cthis might sound weird but I really trust you\u201d... or I feel like I really got to know you (he definitely didn\u2019t because I wouldn\u2019t let him). Or \u201cI feel like I have a great connection with you\u201d. Even after saying he didn\u2019t want something serious. \n\n5. He would always boast about how he liked to do nice things for people. Specifically for me. On the card he wrote to me on the flowers for Valentine\u2019s Day, he said something like \u201cthis is just the kind of guy I am I like to do nice things for people I care about\u201d \n\n6. He said numerous times... as if trying to convince me... that he was the most laid back guy I\u2019ll ever meet. But he\u2019s actually quite pushy and bossy. \n\nLong story short I ended up breaking it off after our short month fling, told him the truth that I got another job and would be on the road a lot and didn\u2019t want to continue on with this fling. Said we could just be friends if he wanted to be. \n\nThen the texting started. He first said he didn\u2019t want to talk to me anymore, when I told him that was fine and I respected his position.... I assumed it was behind me and he\u2019d stop talking to me... I never let my guard down with him anyway.\n\nNope... he still kept talking to me. \n\nHe drunk texted me the next week and said that \u201cI was never going to meet anyone else like him\u201d ...who says that??? \n\nHe kept texting me said he missed talking to me everyday and there had to be more blah blah. He said things like buying me sunflowers for Valentine\u2019s Day was the opposite of wanting something serious. \n\nHe said that he didn\u2019t want anything serious and never did. Actions not really lining up with his words..? \n\nI basically responded that was just how I felt and left it at that. I decided after he drunk texted me I wasn\u2019t going to entertain his crap anymore because he literally kept texting me the same thing in different words and I had already discussed it with him and gotten my point across. \n\nAnd then he recently texted me.., again... after a week and half or more of no communication with the same bullshit about how he misses talking to me. And I didn\u2019t reply. I didn\u2019t want to be a jerk like that but as far as I was concerned we already had this conversation and I wasn\u2019t having it again. \n\nSo then he passively aggressively just texted me again... 2 days later... \u201cwhatever\u201d as if trying to provoke me to respond.\n\nSo I can\u2019t tell... is he a Narc? \n\n....Or he is just a normal guy that\u2019s either too clingy or just into me more than I am into him? \n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Like all bad relationships, it started of great and then turned wrong. In the very beginning I had a best friend who I had known since kindergarten, she was dating his best friend and we all went on double dates together and it was probably the best months of my life. But what we knew was coming finally happened, and she had to move states. From then on out I was the worst I\u2019d ever been and my boyfriend became his worst to. He pressured me into sending photos and that was the first, biggest red flag. He talked about girls he used to like or found hot to make me mad when he needed to or just to joke and make me upset. I truly don\u2019t even know why. He was very jealous and protective, but those were the main problems only then. Our relationship now is nothing but fighting. He will yell at me over the smallest of things, degrade me of all my self worth, and scream the nastiest of things at me. He\u2019s fake broke up with me so many times and every time he\u2019ll wait till I\u2019m in tears and he says he was kidding, and every single time no matter how horrible of what he\u2019s said or even if the fight wasn\u2019t my fault, the second he\u2019s not mad at me, I stop crying and I act like nothing happened. Because I will do anything to try and avoid him being mad at me. He will accuse me of liking somebody and yell at me for being a no good cheater, but he\u2019s bluntly said how he\u2019s liked the girl I\u2019ve always been worrying about while we are dating or how he\u2019s catching feelings for someone else, how this person looks so much better than me and how I\u2019m to fat or to skinny, and just list all of my insecurities. He makes sure to do this when he knows he\u2019s loosing a fight, just to make me weak. \n\nI have developed bulimia (when you throw up your food) and anorexia because of him. He always said I was to skinny so I ate till I gained weight and I then started to hate my image so I resorted to throwing up. I\u2019ve become so depressed to where I\u2019ve self harmed. When he finds this out instead of comforting me he yells at me. Mental illness is just attention to him. \n\nHe\u2019s often like this only over the phone, but if he\u2019s angry at me in person he will squeeze my hand till I yell, and grab or punch my thigh and arm until I bruise. My friends have tried so hard to get me out of this situation but I refuse, they have even admitted to giving up on me and just staying out of it because im so stubborn about it. I know what I\u2019m in, I know how wrong and messed up it is, but I love him. Is this love? No, but in my world I\u2019m just used to it and it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d for our relationship. I can\u2019t imagine breaking up with him and hurting him like he hurts me, because I know how much it sucks... He\u2019s even said to me, the reason he treats me like this is because he knows I won\u2019t leave, because I\u2019m weak. And it\u2019s so true. And I just listen to him say that and do nothing but try and silence my cries. I\u2019ve pushed away friends, family, help. But through all this I still stay because when he\u2019s not the monster he is, he\u2019s the sweetest thing.

We were friends for about a year before we started dating. The first 8 months were amazing. Honestly some of the best times in my life, I recently came out of a very miserable place in my life due to drugs and was finally starting to believe I could live and be happy.  I have been clean over two and a half years now. \n\nWe may have trauma bonded to some extent looking back now. Ive always been very supportive of him; he claimed he had been through a boat capsizing in which his friend died and a car accident in which his high school girlfriend died. He claimed he had a heart attacked at 28. He claimed he was mugged coming home from the gym one day. That he was affiliated with a gang. That he killed some one. A lot of things I was always so impressed he survived and came put clean on the other side. He started coming home looking off, and was broke almost instantly after getting paid. I confronted him with a drug test after about a week and he admitted he relapsed on heroin. He declined rapidly and lost his job. I supported him going into treatment. I was there for him emotionally physically and financially. He went into a few places and kept leaving. He would come home and take my money and go get high. One day I called his mother and told her I thought he needed to address some of the unresolved trauma from the boat/car accident, she had no idea what I was talking about. I called his dad, no idea. His baby mama, no idea. All of these claims none of his family knew about. He even had a separate face book with another name he went by in his home town and I found the girlfriend he claimed died and she is living a great life with two babies and a husband. Everything was a lie. Or at least I cant find any proof to support these things. I thought I was going crazy. I didnt actually know the person I was living with at this point. I confronted him over the phone and informed his therapists at these facilities that he was experiencing some delusions or lying about who he was only hoping they could properly diagnose him so he could get better one day. But he never stayed long enough to address these claims.\n\nHe still says these things happened. I decided it wasn't the best time to talk about this stuff since he just started getting clean again. I decided to just leave. He didnt allow me to do that. He called my job and tried to get me fired. HR looked through the cameras at his claims and found nothing to support them. They directed any staff to call police if they saw him because they realized how crazy he was. We were apart for about 2 months and I slept with 1 person at this time. He has shamed me for that.\n\nTime went by and I missed him for some reason. Or so I thought. We started talking again because honestly I missed the good times and had hoped we could get there again and he could be honest about the massive lies. He said he would do right by me this time and be there for me. Well big shock that didnt happen. In fact my mother recently got very sick and he actually ignored me during this time while I was having a mental breakdown over it. Just like when we were together I would have days where I was struggling and he would just dissapear. He never came clean about the lies and started the abuse cycle all over again. I know I sound like a crazy person and writing this out was hard. My friends are all blown away I've stayed with him this long and no one in my life likes him or wants to be around him. I finally came to a point these last few weeks where I am so miserable to be around him. I am scared to leave at this point. I know some of you my feel like I am a complete nut job and I feel the same. It was difficult to write this...it took me about 3 days to post this. I want to heal. I want to be better and heal from this nightmare. What is wrong with me that I was attracted to this person? What is wrong with him? Am I going crazy or do I have stock home syndrome...I havent spoken to him in two days because he knows my mom isnt doing well and that isnt relevant to him.

The last time I saw her, she was a psychological therapist in training, she's now senior psychological therapist. We caught up on what's been happening in our lives over the past few years and eventually I disclosed to her the complex relationship I've had with my 'best' friend, let's call her Beth. \n\nI told her the story of Beth, and how Beth and I had 'fallen out' a month ago, as our relationship dynamic had changed and I was becoming more and more suspicious of her behaviour, more aware of her deception towards me and more irritated by her delusions of grandeur. The fantasy world in which she was pretending to live was grating on me, I'd been there through it all, through the self-harming and the suicide attempts and the relationship breakdowns, even eased her guilt while she cheated on her partner (who was my friend) and turned me against her and vice-versa etc. As my sympathy for her waned, I realised just how one-sided our relationship was, I was always there, offering emotional and practical support and care, but when I needed anything, she was nowhere to be seen. I was conscious of her damage, so I didn't give her a hard time, I gave her opportunities to be a good friend, but she let me down, over and over.\n\nEventually, after she made me feel really isolated and hurt, I confronted her, I told her I believed our friendship was broken and in order to repair WE needed to change things. I said I was disappointed in how she had been treating me and suggested we do some fun things together to make some new good memories and rebuild. She shut me down, said it was all in my head and that she wanted things to stay as they were. When I went back with concrete examples and an almost ultimatum of 'I love you, but I'm unhappy and our friendship cannot continue as it stands', she told me she had nothing more to say, that she was too drained and tired to talk about it and that was that. I somehow left the conversation feeling like I had done something wrong. I knew then I had been manipulated, I left telling her I loved her and I'd be there when she was ready to talk. \n\nMy therapist friend responded to the story, 'Which personality disorder has she been diagnosed with?' 'None, or none that she's admitted to anyway.' 'Wellll... She sounds VERY BPD/NPD. Your relationship is completely one-sided, you need to stay away. She has given you nothing but stress and pain.' \n\nI've know for a long time that our friendship was over/that is never really existed. She 'love bombs' people, I've witnessed this countless times during time together, most of those people have since departed, but that's how she hooked me. Then she literally trapped me by moving just a few houses down from me and finally, I formed a very close bond with her children and felt a huge sense of responsibility for their welfare, especially after one of her more extreme suicide attempts. She is pretty much alone, her family are all distant, her remaining friends are superficial, I feel like I am maybe one of the only people left who has seen her true vulnerable self, and I feel guilty for walking away, but guilt isn't enough and I have to live my own life. I have been a caretaker for too long and a fool.\n\nI'm actually hideously upset writing this, turning my back on her children makes me feel like the biggest douche of all time, but I don't know what else I can do. It's time to move on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My brother (2 years younger than me) is on the autism spectrum and has bipolar disorder. We were always fighting and this led to verbal and physical abuse by my own mother.\n\nMy mother is a prescription drug addict. She overdoses daily on a concoction of drug cocktails which include painkillers such as Vicodin and Oxycontin. She is in an almost comatose state, sleeping for days on end, and when active, has no recollection whatsoever. You can say something to her and ask her to repeat what you said, and she'll just stand there and stare, giving you no response, or ask you to repeat yourself.\n\nMy sister (1 year younger than me) is a hermit. She would isolate herself in her bedroom and play computer games day in and day out, only leaving her room to go to the bathroom or get food. She had no social life and lived to play games.\n\nI was brought up in an extremely stressful environment. Between school, family issues, and work, I was so stressed out that I was socially isolated, and had self destructive coping mechanisms such as over-eating, or binging on foods extremely high in sugar.\n\nGrowing up, I always remember my dad being verbally abusive. I hated him and everything that came out of his mouth. He never had anything constructive to say and always put everyone down. It was only 3 years ago that I formed a relationship with him.\n\n3 years ago, I finally caught on to the fact that my mother was killing herself with drugs. I never even questioned why she acted strangely so often, but after finding pill bottles and speaking with my father, I concluded she was abusing prescriptions. My father and I started forming a common goal, getting my mother to admit she had a problem and clean up her act. Long story short, she brainwashed my siblings (who I had previously had good relationships with) to think we were toxic, and they left to go live in Yucca Valley California.\n\nNot until after this happened did I start making friends. I changed jobs and my attitude toward school changed. I felt as though a 100 pound weight had been lifted off of my chest after 15 years. I felt happy and free. I made friends at school and had a flourishing social life.\n\nSomewhere along the line my relationship with my father turned toxic. We had both been there for each other and dare I say loved each other after my mom left, but he began to become angry-all the time. Flash forward to now, I have noticed that in the past year my father has a hair trigger. Non-issues or simple misphrasing of words of sentences will cause him from being completely calm and rational to red-in-the-face screaming. He will go absolutely batshit and then gaslight me, telling me that he has an \"episodic memory\" of me doing this or that, and will tell me straight to my face that I am crazy, although I know for a fact this is bullshit. You can *NEVER* dispute anything he says or he will turn it into a yelling match, even if he is clearly wrong. I simply have to accept the fact that I know I am correct about something but say nothing or else I will get screamed at.\n\nI start my workday at 5 A.M. This means I'm awake at 3 A.M. to eat breakfast, drink coffee, take a shower and get dressed, then go to work. I work 8 hours until 1:30, then come home and relax for a half hour until I take another shower (I work at a home improvement store, and my job entails getting sweaty and covered in nasty stuff like concrete mix, drywall, dirt  from sod, etc.) and go to my night class at the community college he teaches at. One day I got home from work and was listening to music and he prodded me and then when I became irritated, exploded and started screaming his head off about things that happened in the past (and were not big deals either, such as forgetting to close the garage door when I parked my car in the garage, not doing exactly as he says when he says it, etc.) I can have my hands full after going to the grocery store (as he asked me to do) and I will have to go into the kitchen to set them down before I can close the garage door, and when I say \"give me a second\" he will scream at me things like \"don't give me any of this gimme a second bullshit, you always say that, close the goddamn garage door).\n\nI will be friendly to him and he will respond with unprovoked anger. My father has no social life outside of work. He is extremely overweight, and this is due to the fact that he comes home after work and eats while watching television for HOURS on end until he goes to sleep and repeats his routine of going to work, coming home, eating, and going to sleep. It's actually depressing. I on the other hand try to avoid him through my work, school, and socializing with my friends. I have been in fights with them, being called needy, because I will try to hang out with them constantly to avoid my toxic home life which I have completely hidden from them. I have no siblings to vent to, and my friends are my family.\n\nI firmly believe that my father treats me this way not because he hates me, but because he has no other outlet for his anger, and he takes it out on me without understanding the consequences of his actions. He praises me for my high grades in school and valiant effort at work. He acts as though he loves me, but tarnishes it by exploding at me constantly. When I spoke to him about moving out, he got angry and tried his best to convince me to stay. After community college, I want to go to a university 40 miles south, and had to convince him that I would wait to move until I go there. He also tried to convince me to move back when I'm done there. I'm 18... I've come to the conclusion that once I do move out, I'm NEVER looking back, although I'm saving money now, I do not have the resources needed to move out. I do not spend my money frivolously. I have around 4k in my bank account and rarely splurge on myself. I treat myself to a soda after work and a hot chocolate once every week from a gas station near my house and that's it. Right now I'm faced with 2 options. Move out and work full time and save up enough money to go to school, but put school and my future on hold, or suffer through 2 more years of abuse until I have enough money to move out and never look back.\n\nI have to remain on good terms with him though as I have a plethora of medical problems that are not cheap, and without health insurance, would not only wipe me dry, but pulverize me with debt.\n\nI feel trapped. I have no one other than my friends to lean on for emotional support, and no one who could help me escape this emotional hellhole financially. I feel as though the 100 pound weight that was lifted off my chest when my abusive mother left was replaced by a 1000 pound weight.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

She was blocking the door saying that I can\u2019t leave if we are broken up. \n\nAnyway maybe I\u2019m way off but I kinda had to get it out. It\u2019s scary being in this situation and was wondering if this is something others can relate to.\n\nShe also has weird relationships with other people. She dislikes most people but will let a few into every aspect of her life.\n\nI don\u2019t want to make it seem like I don\u2019t stand up for myself or like I have no back bone. I\u2019ve kind of just put our relationship on hold in hope of sorting out what is real and what is my anxiety.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

From a very young age, I'd say around when I was 7 or 8, my brothers abuse began to have a significant impact on me. I was being bullied at school and then I would come home to my brother telling me that nobody loves me, I'm worthless, and that I should kill myself. My parents were/are abusive to me themselves so I believed him. The rest of my family lives in a different country so I was/am truly alone. I became depressed from a young age and I honestly wanted to die. I remember one day when I was around 8-9 laying underneath my bed and trying to hold my breath as long as I could so I could die but I realized that it wouldn't kill me so I prayed to god and begged him to kill me so I could go to heaven. Eventually my brother turned to physical abuse, he knew he could hit me and get away with it so he punished me for any little mistake I made. From a very young age, I was walking on egg-shells because I knew my brother was waiting for the chance to put his hands on me. I remember that one day he was unhappy with something I did so he grabbed me by my hair and dragged to where the cats bowls are. He held me down and forced me to eat cat food. I remember screaming for my mom to help me who was only 6 steps away in the kitchen but she just ignored me like she always did when my brother was tormenting me. I would frequently beg my parents to help me, to do something about him because he was torturing me but nothing came of it. And today, now that I am 21 years old and my brother no longer lives in my parents house I still suffer when he comes to visit. He is still insanely disrespectful of me and expects me to do everything for him (dishes, clean up after him, etc.) and when I tell him no he throws a fit and calls me every name in the book. But the part that hurts me the most is that when I try to talk to my parents about it they act as though they had no idea that he was abusing me and that they just don't know what to do now because he won't listen to them. Plus, my boyfriend is tired of hearing about it and it hurts me. I know its not his burden to listen to my troubled past but I feel like I have no one to turn to now.  I'm sorry if this was all very jumbled and made no sense. I'm quite frustrated right now because I feel so helpless. I have so much anger in me and absolutely no way of getting it out.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

She also says and does things that make no sense, for her own purposes, and can be incredibly manipulative. Important for this post, she 100% would victim blame survivors of sexual abuse. Based on so many fucked up things she's said over the years. I haven't trusted her for at least the last 10 years.\n\nOther background info, about 2 years ago the guy I was living with sexually assaulted me twice. It took me a year to report, but the case will finally be going to trial very soon. Between that, and sexual assaults that have been huge news in my community lately, I've been having more of a hard time than normal lately. \n\nWhen I first started living with the guy a couple years ago, we had been friends/dating. Before the assaults or anything else happened, my grandma sent me a text late one night. She told me (22 at the time and had dated before) to not live with an \"older man\" (30) because he could \"convince\" me to \"do things\". And a couple more really messed up things, to which I never replied. There had already been a pattern of her telling me similar things over the years, basically as if I couldn't think for myself and also couldn't be trusted to date/have sex. I honestly think her doing this to my mom, and it all getting passed down to me, is why I have so many of the issues with relationships that I have.\n\nSo now, with the events in the news, she has taken it upon herself to text me last night and tonight. I rarely hear from her, except to tell me what I should do, so of course I already have my suspicions. Last night's text said if sexual assault ever happens to me, to report it right away. Tonight's text really is fucking with me and made me cry. \"I know u will, but pls be extra cautious and don't let guys try to sweet talk. They have their ways and they have had for years and years.  I love you!\" \n\nNo. You do not get to 1. Talk to me like this, especially when you would victim blame me if you knew what he did to me 2. Treat me like I'm incompetent 3. Tell me you're doing this (like everything) out of love, when you only want to make yourself feel good 4. Be the reason me, my mom, and even my aunt and uncle have messed up perspectives on relationships in some way. You have lost my trust a long time ago, and you've had more than enough time in your life to learn how to be a decent person. You have no respect for anyone who goes against you. You very obviously show me that you don't respect what I'm doing with my life. Why do you think I should even respond to you when you do this? There's a reason I started a new life, and you have a lot to do with it. \n\nAs much as I can, I do avoid interacting with her. I only talk to her when necessary so that the rest of my family doesn't have to hear about it. And I refuse to respond to any of her messages like this. I get so frustrated and almost just want to tell her how much that fucks with me, but she would absolutely tell me I did something to deserve it/should have let her protect me like a child. Thank you all for letting me get this out, I'm pretty pissed and reliving a lot. \n\nTLDR, my insensitive grandma keeps thinking she has the right to tell me how not to get assaulted, what to do if it happens, and to talk to me as if I know nothing about anything related to relationships. She's bringing up the worst memories of my life, and if she ever found out she would say it served me right. Then she wonders why I don't talk to her whenever possible. Also, I have no idea why she's so fixated on this. \n\n\n", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I told him he can't do that during both sex or arguments and he agreed but also thought I was overreacting. I know he comes from an abusive background and so I feel like he would know I guess. I am really sorry about how scattered this is, I just feel so confused and weird about putting this problem on Reddit.

{"post_id": "az0j9e", "created_utc": 1552112553, "title": "My story *Warning: Long*", "author": "beepboopneepnoop", "self_text": "Hello all,\n\nI am new to reddit, but I have this feeling of needing to share my story. You may refer to me as beep or L inside of the comments if you want to comment. For reference, I am 19. So with that here is my story.\n\nI don't really know where to start. My parents weren't really abusive per say. I have a much better relationship with them now, but as I was growing up until halfway or so into my senior year of high school (17), my parents had very high expectations for me. I would work so hard to be a good kid, get good grades, and things just never seemed good enough for them at times. I was a weird kid, who was avoided and constantly taken advantage of. This is the seed where my depression, anxiety, and need to put others' happiness before my own kind of started. \n\nSo I met this guy (we shall call him T) the summer after my freshman year (15). He was two and a half years older than me, and I met him at a distant relative's fourth of july party in another state. I went back home to my home state and maintained contact with him for months before he asked me to be his girlfriend, so right off the bat, we were in a long distance relationship. It all started off good, but then he started to show his true self. He would ask me of pictures and more skype calls. They were innocent at first like me just taking a selfie while being fully clothed or like just being on a skype call for video games and such. Then, he started to ask me for more provocative pictures. First, more revealing clothing. Next, less clothes. I was already very self conscious at that point. I haven't had much experience at all with boys. I felt very uncomfortable. After telling him that I was uncomfortable sending more pictures, he yelled at me saying that then maybe he should just resort to seeking out more porn or other sexier looking girls on the internet. Me being anxious and naive, I started to comply. So, whenever he asked, I would send nudes (Age of consent in my state is 17. I was 15-16 throughout our relationship.) He would guilt me or coerce me into getting into skype calls and performing sexual acts or posing and showing off my body. He said that if I loved him, I would do it. He would masturbate to me during those calls, and I slowly got used to it and desensitized to it. I would always feel really dirty or uncomfortable. He came to visit my house for 3 weeks the following year. A few days before my 16th birthday, he was hinting at us moving further than just kissing and hugging even though just the day before we just had our first kiss. So, I made a joke saying it sounded like he wanted me to blow him or something. I wasn't thinking much of it. It sounded ridiculous to me. Then, after kissing for a little, he said, \"Come on. Do it. If you loved me, you would do it\". I was alone with him, and I felt so guilty about the idea of displeasing him. \n\nT: \"You have done similar things over Skype. You can just do it here now.\"\n\nSo, there I was giving my first blow job at 15 years old when just the day before, I never saw myself doing that until I was older. For the rest of those weeks, he kept pushing the bar further and further except having sex because he is Catholic and \"the Lord wouldn't be pleased with him if he did so\". When he was gone, things got worse with the sexual things. He made these names such as Kitten and Harlot. He would ask me more frequently to masturbate or imitate blowjobs on camera. It broke me down more and more. Some times, I found myself taking multiple showers because I just didn't feel right with my own body. He got to the point of trying to get me to roleplay bdsm type things of tying myself up or fantasizing about dressing me up in a bitch suit, degrading me, making me eat out of a dog bowl, and begging for him to take me. I was able to stand up for myself and not have to do it over Skype. He, instead, made me call him or text him to fulfill  that fantasy of his. This led up to when I broke up with him 20 minutes before the clock struck midnight indicating it was my 17th birthday. That was just the sexual abuse. \n\nThere were mind games, emotional, and verbal abuse involved as well. He saw my depression and anxiety developing. He even tried to discourage me from seeking help until after the first year. Initially, it was fine for me to go out all the time with my family, friends, and for my extracurricular activities. After he left my house, he would get more clingy. He would be upset if I didn't text him back right away even though I was in class. He would also be upset when I was out with friends or family and wasn't always texting him during those times too. He would guilt me into staying at home in my room, so that I could Skype him or call him and play video games with him. When I went out with my guy friends, he got really upset. This escalated to even jealousy when I was with my brothers. I was getting more and more distant from my family and friends because he would encourage me to talk to him about my problems and to speak to him so often. When he didn't get his way, he would go on and on about how I wasn't being a good girlfriend. He said those things during our more sexual encounters. He would degrade me. He made me take the blame for every problem we had. If I was upset with him, it would end with me begging for forgiveness. I felt so guilty and indebted to him. I kind of ended up in a Stockholm Syndrome type state where I felt like I would be nothing without him. He was my everything. \n\nA week before my break up with T, I met another guy named S. I met him as I was third wheeling a date with one of my best friends. He was brought as company. I quickly told him I was unavailable, and S asked about my relationship with T and what it was like. I told him about how I was feeling and just the day to day things about the relationship throughout the night. He looked at him with concern, and sometimes, he looked as if he was just thinking. He ended up dropping me off at home, but then he stopped to talk to me in his car before he left. S told me how things weren't right and begged me to rethink things. He said that he would try to sweep me off my feet and that he would make me feel so good. In this moment, I thought he was talking about making me feel like a princess. I declined his offer but was happy to have someone listen to me that wasn't T.(Foreshadowing) I left his car and said thanks for being a good friend. Then, the next week I broke up with T because his roommate asked to speak with me and admitted that he was disgusted at how T treated me. They were good friends, but he said that he remembered vividly waking up to the sounds of my sobs loudly coming out of T's \"sound absorbing\" headphones. Instead of T actively comforting me, he was giving me short \"yeah\" \"okay\" answers as he was playing his computer games. My Skype video was visible in the corner of his screen, and there I was sobbing. His roommate admitted to T confessing that he thought my depression and anxiety was a sham. This was the line I drew. I promptly broke up with him because I was at my breaking point already at that point. I didn't want to start another year of my life being in pain like I was before. \n\nThat summer already my uncle had died, and my grandmother's Alzheimer's progressed to her not being able to recognize me and grow to be quite mean to me. I started to go out more clubbing each weekend with the wrong crowd, S included. S spent his time flirting with me, casually touching me, and talking to me. Eventually, we were hanging out at his place alone and then we started to make out. From there, he started to move things forward. He mentioned sex, and I refused. Then, he started to say that he could make me forget T and make me feel so good. I still refused. He kept trying to coerce me, persuade me, and touch me. I kept saying no until finally, I was just tired and wanted to forget things. I was depressed and felt like nothing. So like that, he took my virginity. I felt so uncomfortable afterwards. This happened almost exactly the same for a second time. About a week passed, and I found out from friends in the wrong crowd that S had been going around telling everyone I was his side hoe and that all you had to do was call me cute or pretty, and my legs would open write up. I had a full mental breakdown and had every motive to want to attempt suicide at that moment, but since I was with friends, they prevented me from doing anything drastic at that moment. I later tried to starve myself to death, but then I read an article about how suicidal people don't really want to commit suicide, but, instead, it just took one thing to push them over the edge. This led me to being hospitalized for 3 weeks in an adolscent outpatient program. I didn't go to school or anything during those 3 weeks except for the hospital. Shortly after I got out, my grandmother passed away, and I haven't been the same since. \n\nMy depression and anxiety has slowly gotten worse. I tried to starve myself to death again for my second attempt and was very recently admitted into inpatient psychiatric care (I am out now) for suicidal ideation and being reasy to do something more drastic. It was only a couple months ago did I come to understand I was sexually abused and assaulted. I also have identified  with the help of counselors and doctors in my recent hospitalization that a lot of my current problems with depression, anxiety, blaming myself for everything, and feeling guilty stem from the abuse I suffered.\n\nToday, I felt good. I am trying to think of ways to cope and how to make my life better. I recently also just had been broken up with by my now-ex, but I can assure you all that it was all fond memories. He is my best friend. He never neglected me or ever made me feel guilty. If I said no, he immediately stopped. He held me and made me feel safe. I was able to be myself and feel happy even though everything around me was consuming me. I now know what a good relationship is and am glad to know that him, and I will continue forth being best friends at the very least. I secretly hope to get back together with him, but for now, I am focusing on learning to love myself and dealing with my mental health. I am looking forward to life in the future. Although, I am still very traumatized. I am happy to say that I am happy to be alive and that I wouldn't be here without the few people, who were there to support me when I needed it.

I have always grown up in a home filled with yelling and hitting and sadness. The smallest I can remember being hit was when we lived in Mexico I remember I had turned 5 or 6 and I was carrying a big ceramic plate and I dropped it, shattering it, I don\u2019t remember how things played out but I remember it hurting to sit down in my little pre k or kindergarten, and I lied saying I had fell off a tree and landed on my butt. When we moved over to the US it got better for a little while, I would still get yelled at but since we lived with family the hitting stopped. I remember this time as the happiest time of my life, my dad who we moved to America for me to meet never came in the picture, but a man who was a true angel took me under his wing as his own son, taking me out for ice cream, playing catch with me, and maybe sometimes lecturing me when I did something wrong, after 2 years of knowing him he was diagnosed with cancer and passed away, I remember that day was the saddest of my life, the light of my world had been put out for no reason I was angry at everything and I missed school for a day or two, when I came back to school more things broke down my \u201cgirlfriend\u201d we had never agreed that\u2019s what she was and what I was but it was pretty clear that\u2019s how we treated each other was cheating on me with my best friend. They both cut me out of they\u2019re life\u2019s. My mom managed to get a house after that and it escalated again, VERY quickly. The hits came back she would slap me or just whip me with a belt and if I even whimpered it was another one (basically I couldn\u2019t react to the force of a leather belt smacking my ass. Then she would slap me, one time on our ways to a family members home, I don\u2019t remember what happened she slap me in the car and my nose started bleeding, she told me if I told them, I would get it worst at home so I kept my mouth shut. I haven\u2019t spoken about it to this day. Recently she has started calling me names like saying I\u2019m retarded, worthless, or a waste of human life. She has also told me something that really hurt she did and I quote \u201cyour the worst son anybody could ever ask for I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t abort you like your 3 older siblings\u201d I had no idea that I had siblings that were aborted so that really hurt me she also broke a ceramic handle thing on my chin by hitting me with it, leaving a nasty mark for awhile and all I could tell the people who asked was I fell off my skateboard. I just feel like anyone who tries to love me pushes me away, and the one person who succeeded died and this makes me feel horrible.

She had started the conversation and said hi how are you. I kept reading and she was asking personal questions like age what he did for work and what happened with him and his gf. He said he had cheated on her with a married woman. My ex started laughing with him and asked him why he cheated on her with a married woman. He said because he likes a challenge.

Plan B is to apply to grad school at the local university and get started on a Master's. My roommate would have to find someone else to sign a new lease with her if I leave early.\n\nMy (F23) N-roommate (F39) was brought to the states as a teenager and has only lived with her sister since. Her sister, after deciding to move out and start a family in December, left on bad terms with NR which has resulted in NR with a serious insomnia problem due to stress.\n\nNR vents to me constantly. The problem is that I can see how she probably pushed her sister away due to a toxic / narcissistic attitude. In response to \"your sister just had her first baby so she's maybe she's a little pre-occupied / stressed out with new motherhood,\" NR will immediately snap the response, \"yeah, but doesn't she understand how I feel? how I went out of my way to visit her at the hospital after working a double shift without eating or drinking a single glass of water or getting any sleep? why can't she just answer my texts? why can't she explain why she's been so mean to me?\" sort of this \"me, me, me\" attitude that I used to see a lot with my N-mother.\n\nI understand that she's stressed out right now and going through a lot of life changes - but her N-attitude is seeping out into how she treats me as a roommate. She's very nit picky, very demanding, passive aggressive, and is starting to complain more and more about little things I do that annoy her while I get ready for work or cooking meals.\n\nAside from the narcissism, she is generally a nice person, but just a bit inexperienced about living with a roommate and ignorant of others' feelings or needs. As a roommate, I tend to be very amicable and want to avoid issues or disputes with whoever I'm living with (due to past bad experiences) - but I just wanted to know if there are any tips for these next 4-12 months:\n\n1.

This'll probably be my last post about my suspected narc.\n\nSo a month after I went NC and then failed (thought friend I could resolve issues), during the next 2 months we talked out our issues via email. Back at the end of October last year, we actually talked voice-to-voice. I explained my needs in a friendship and suggested ultimately what they might be doing wrong in their other friendships (they complained consistently about people not hearing them or them having to put in all the effort).\n\nA two-way friendship is all I was asking for: share some things, talk when you can, put a bit of effort in, ask how the other person is. Basic stuff.\n\nThe first month they go overboard: very regular contact, three times a day (having problems with sibling so they were lonely). I was out of work and not busy so it didn't bother me at the time and we had things to catch up on. I did however tell them they didn't have to thank me as much and inquired if they were interrupting as often as they did. Minor stuff\n\nThis lead to a meltdown. Supposedly I was trying to control them, that they couldn't be this ideal I perceived them as (?), which was never explained. I basically talked them down from an emotional ledge. I was gentle but didn't fully understand why they thought the way they did.\n\nAnyway, they said they couldn't talk as much, which was fine. But at the same time they acted a bit distant, which is a warning sign for me (in the past a couple of times I've seen them turn on a dime and just stop talking to me). My enquiring about this change lead to me being called manipulative etc. Supposedly I was attacking their identity because I wasn't just accepting of however they chose to act.\n\nWe talked through it. At this point I was really feeling like I couldn't ask basic questions like I would of any other friends. But we were still talking honestly and openly about out lives so...what the hell.\n\nCue another issue a month later when they start to use subtle devaluation, something they called 'roasting'. I mean to me 'dance you stupid monkey boy' and 'you're just a wonderful idiot' and another 30 other examples seemed to come out of nowhere. Again, she was exclaimed that I wasn't letting her be who she was (I'd rarely seen her say things like this up until that point and I've known her for 7 or so years). Then her telling me she trusts no one after we had also had a long talk about trust and how that builds over time etc. Ugh.\n\nSo...I've was thinking of moving to their city (I love the place and lived their before) and they've been encouraging me and saying we'll do this and that and, hey, they can come visit etc.\n\nSo I finally do. The first time I see this person, it's great. The second was okay too.\n\nThen it all changes. I stop hearing from them. They get back to me infrequently. I ask how they are and they dance around the topic when we'd been quite open before. They know I'm going through a rough time, so why would they not at least check in, you know? I do with them. When they do talk, they're short and kind of...angry in general.\n\nLong story short, they get upset at something I say but when I try and explain they backtrack and act like they don't care about my opinion and...yes, very invalidating and just plain rude. There were hints of this in other conversations but I ignored it. They can be...strange sometimes. They leave the conversation.\n\nThey must have realised they were being a douche. They offer an apology that's not really an apology (they're on their womanly time of the month) but then throw shit at me like:\n1. Sometimes I just need a different energy and you and I have fundamental differences. I ask her about these differences. Turns out she misunderstood what I said and the maybe 2 conversations we've had that have been slightly negative (all her doing) out of thousands of hours of communication are the reason for distance and her being upset...and yet she shut me down when I tried to explain.\n2. Somehow I am both ignoring them but also relying on them to much?\n3. They are working on themselves in therapy and 'I might need to hurt some of the people around me to get to my root trauma'.\n4. Ugh. She admits to pushing everyone away and saying no one really cares.\n\nWe kind of work it out. \n\n3 weeks go by of not much communication and there's more distancing language. Rather than, 'Hey, I really wanna catch up' I get 'I'd appreciate if you could spare an hour or two, thanks'. There's more but it was just...strange again. She opts out an hour later because she's tired.\n\nI say, 'Look is this how it's supposed to be now? Because you seem less and less interested in staying friends and I can't keep reaching out and acting eager to see you'. \n\nShe blocks me. The person who said they were upset when I went NC, which I apologised for profusely, has blocked me.\n\nI get very, very angry. Through SMS she says she's trying to make changes in her life that she likes and I obviously don't. There're ominous warnings: 'You probably won't like what my therapist will have to say about my feelings regarding this' (sounds like dependence to me, but whatever). \n\nI tell her I am busy and will talk to her later in the week.\n\nLater in the week she is somewhat apologetic and wants to me up face to face.\n\nWe do. She cries. She says she has obligations to her uni etc. I don't think she has any more obligations then she had a month or two previously so that makes no sense to me. She admits to rethinking the friendship (obliquely), which makes me feel like shit considering the effort I've put in because I still care about this can of crazy. She says she's pushed me away. She says some of my comments on Facebook upset her (she later reframes this as her being 'curious and concerned' but whatever).\n\nI feel tired and just go with it. I have very little energy. She seems mollified. She has yet to really ask how I am or focus too much on me.\n\nThe next day, she says she wants to meet for a coffee soon to discuss it a little further. At the meetup, she professes to being upset at her other friends (most kind of acquaintances/friends as far as she tells me) because none of them have ever had talks like I've had with her. She's decided this might mean they have little investment in her.\n\nShe may be right. \n\nShe has also overlooked the fact that she has at least one person who does give a fuck. This is after their sibling treating them like crap for months.\n\nShe's been acting nicer recently but...I can't bring myself to reach out. She's different now and I barely know anything about her life. She also gets angry easily (before she was sweeter and considerate) and over things that seem kind of inconsequential, much like a younger child would express their anger. ('Who picks on a person for their shoes?! FUCK THOSE PEOPLE.')\n\nI am at a loss. I think if she'd actually apologised for blocking me instead of saying 'Am I going to be hearing about this over and over again?' when that was one of the things we'd supposedly met up for coffee to discuss...but nope.\n\nThis person was my closest friend. I've cared about them since they were an insecure, sweet girl who just seemed to want the best for everyone around them and their family. I think therapy has made them more outspoken but...worse. I've seen them bully family members verbally...\n\nAny advice? Cut and run again? *sigh*\n\nTl;dr: ...just, what the actual fuck?\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

But he is still able to make me second-guess that too often. Apologies ahead of time because this is my first post and it's going to get long. I only have one person that I can occasionally vent to about this situation.\n\nThe Nex and I have a 10 year history. We were actually only a couple for the first three and a half or so years but he has still lived with me since then, save for the first 5ish months after breaking up and for 5 months 3 years ago. This is because he claimed he had nowhere else to go and would be homeless otherwise (despite having a huge family living within an hour of here). Homelessness wasn't an option for him due to legal issues.\n\nI didn't realize I was being emotionally abused until about 5 years ago. He has stayed in love with me the entire time and so is jealous, possessive, and all around difficult to deal with when I try to have a social life without him (limited as it is given I'm an introvert and homebody and don't have family or friends I'm close to). To go out with men, I have to act like a woman who is cheating on her partner, even though I am technically single.\n\nAbout 5 weeks ago, he came home and saw me with one of my fwbs when he showed up in the evening on a day different than when he said he would be here. For a few months now, he has been spending more time with family in Michigan (or so I thought) than at my house. His Dad was supposed to be particularly ill and refusing medical treatment. My ex (we'll call him G) was particularly traumatized by seeing me with another guy even though he knows I have been with others previously in the last couple of years. He could have prevented it if he had told me the correct evening he was going to be at my house, and when he came inside, he could have announced his presence before walking down the hall and throwing open my bedroom door. After the ensuing very loud, public, and embarrassing scene he made outside (making me look like a cheating girlfriend to my neighbors), he glossed over the realization that he had told me wrong information and that I didn't have a guy over when I knew G would be there on purpose. It was all my fault and I am a sociopath and I was a slut and a whore to him now because I had more than one casual sexual partner (being called that by him really hurt). \n\nIn the last couple months I had two different fwbs with pickup trucks help me bring two 6ft baker's racks to my house. G happened to see both of those trucks in my driveway and I had told him before it was two different guys that helped me. I let slip that one of them was a married man getting divorced from his wife and that led to more insults. And that's when I find out he's had a girlfriend and was living with her for the past five months. (Even though I told him it was two different guys, he now thinks it was just one person and I hesitate to correct him if it should come up again.)\n\nG and I had sex one day when we got too high and too drunk within those past five months after me avoiding sex with him for a very long time. But he was not doing any wrong by cheating on his girlfriend with me, only me being the homewrecker with a married man. \n\nAnyway, that incident led to him making plans to commit suicide. Then days before his set date to do that, he told me, which was a Friday night 3 weeks ago. I spent that weekend trying to talk him out of it along with verifying what he wanted done after he was gone. He also opened up to me about his girlfriend because I'm also his best friend. I found out that she was physically abusive, verbally abusive, had even raped him, but he loved her two kids. Being a father is a particularly important thing to him. I want a kid but have not been ready to have a kid even though I'm in my mid-30s. The father thing is what was primarily keeping him with her. Do you have any idea how bizarre it is to give advice about dealing with abuse as a victim to the person that is your abuser? I was saying things that also applied to my situation with him, except it was still fairly early in his relationship as opposed to years into it with us. To be honest, the karmic irony of him now being in an abusive relationship, but on the receiving side, was amusing to me.\n\nThe only thing that was going to stop his suicide was if I agreed to marry him and have his kid. I couldn't promise that because though I care about his well-being, I am most definitely not in love with him and do not want to be bound to him forever like that. I also found out that he had been seeing a therapist for a few months (ironically G was introduced to him by his girlfriend who doesn't see the therapist as often as she should). That therapist has told him that he's not a narcissist, but that he has been suffering from PTSD, depression, and anxiety. I'm also suffering from depression and anxiety (made much worse by him) and finally conceded to taking medication for it just over a year ago. I haven't yet found a therapist for myself though. \n\nI couldn't have his death on my conscience forever if I hadn't done everything I could to prevent it. I hadn't called his sister in many years after she stole my tax refund by claiming him on her taxes the year we broke up instead of me claiming him as I had been and should have that year. She managed to talk him down from going through with it and one of the things I said to him earlier helped. That thing was saying if I was 40 and still single without a kid, I'd reconsider having a kid with him. But I made no promises.\n\nSo now I'm stuck with a worse situation. After our big argument when I found out he had a girlfriend, I told him he needed to be living with her completely and to stop using and taking advantage of me. I told him I wanted my house key and my car key back. I thought I was getting rid of him, FINALLY. Nope, not the case.\n\nNow he thinks he's getting a second chance at being a couple with me. I stopped denying him sex because of his fragile mental state. (And I won't lie and say the sex isn't good.) But sometimes he'll word things in a manner where he knows part of the agreement was that we have to work on our issues independently to become better friends before being a couple is even a possibility. I can't trust him and he acts like he's entitled to my forgiveness from a cheating incident back when we were a couple. I can't trust him because he constantly lies but he doesn't acknowledge that. He seems to think that cheating incident is the cause of all of our problems essentially. And with his therapist saying he's not a narcissist, G is not taking any responsibility for the stuff he has done to me in the whole time I've known him. That pisses me off. I told him that the therapist doesn't think he's a narcissist because he doesn't know you from my point of view, only what G has told him. He can be a narcissist without knowing it. G thinks I should be able to forgive and move on from everything in the last 10 years and be able to start with a fresh slate. I can't just ignore 10 years of lies and abusive behavior. Oh, and one of the recent times I told him he was gaslighting me, he said he wasn't. The next time it was brought up, he said \"what is gaslighting?\" Then he started saying that I was gaslighting him over and over and abusing him. He definitely projects stuff on to me often.\n\nOne good thing is that he is working a good job now and will have the money to pay his own rent soon. And I will explain to him that despite wanting to live with me again, he needs his own place for us to be able to properly work on ourselves.\n\nI admitted in our emotional weekend that I loved him but was not in love with him. That there was a difference. Now I'm being expected to say that every time he tells me he loves me. I feel trapped by that as well. I do not want a relationship with him. I want to be able to find someone I have a realistic chance of trusting and loving in a healthy relationship. But I really don't think I'll ever be able to trust someone 100%. And yes, I am working on finding a therapist again. \n\nI know I am forgetting a lot, but I've already written too much. There's a lot that has gone on over 10 years that I could vent about. I thought I was finally getting  my life back but instead, I'm more worse off now than I have been in years. Aside from getting a therapist, I don't know what to do.

He is abusive but it's not always quite an active thing, but it is still there. My mom never had money to leave him and that's why I'm still here, which is \"lovely.\" He's never shown any care for us (me + my older brother and sister) or anything. I know some people aren't that verbal when it comes to love, but we never heard an I love you from him once in our entire lives. He never tried to do things with us or for us, never talked to us, never disciplined us like a father would. He would always just lay in bed all day and only acknowledge us if it was to tell us to move out of the way of the TV. He tried to starve my older sister on  a multitude of occasions. He has hurt her physically more than my brother and me. He has hurt my mother. \n\nAnyway, this story took place in seventh grade. It was spring. My mother was annoyed that he did not take the trash. She went on how she would refuse to make dinner for him unless he took the trash. {Note: we live outside of town. Taking out the trash does not mean putting it at the end of our driveway, it means taking it all the way to the dump. The trash was always overflowing because he would never take it.} My mother didn't stick to this though, she made him a can of beans. He went downstairs with it {we never ate at our dining table, but in the family room} and I followed. I  just stood against the wall, lile across from the chair he was in. He got paranoid my mother did something to the food. \n\nMy mother came down, was mad he was refusing to eat the beans. He went upstairs and opened a NEW can of beans which made her more mad. \n\nAt this point I was done with them. I decided to go back upstairs. \n\nSomehow walking past him lead to me and him wresting over a can of beans, I think he reacted weirdly and tried to kick me. \n\nThe beans spilled over me. I ended up backing up to the other side of the room. He stood up and pushed me and swung at me and started charging at me. \n\nPerspective on this, he was an extremely obese tall man and I was tall, but very frail and skinny  (and anorexic at the time as well) with very weak anything. I couldn't kick hard or punch hard or anything and I was not strong in the slightest to stop him. \n\nBut I did have sharp nails. \n\nI grabbed his neck and scratched him, because it was the only way to stop him and I wasn't going to take it. \n\nMy mom was quick to stand up but everything was very fast and weird in seconds. \n\nMe and my mom left the house, first telling his parents what happened {they lived next door, which is why we couldn't kick him out as he would just still be stalking us}. Then mom drove back to the house and got my stuffed animal for me and I think her clothes.  I love stuffed animals. \n\nWe went to her parents house. \n\nThe next day, we went to the police as my sister {a probation officer} was very strongly advocating for it. \n\nArrived at the station. Weirdly no one was there. But we called for someone to arrive there. \n\nDeputy Carter comes back maybe an hour later. \n\nWe tell him what happened. I kept referencing that this kind of thing *has happened before.* \n\nDeputy Carter writes stuff down, asks more questions, etc. \n\nHe then goes to another part of the station for another 40 minutes and comes back out. \n\nMy mom wanted the police to at least go out of there to *talk to him* about how it was wrong to do that. She wasn't sure about pressing any charges or yada dada but she thought if the police told him off about it seriously that he may think again before doing something. \n\nHowever, what came next was shocking. \n\nDeputy Carter: if we even came out there to talk to him, we would have to arrest your daughter. \n\nMom: What? \n\nDeputy Carter: If he said she attacked him, we would arrest her and not him.\n\nBasically, they would take his word over mine. \n\nMe: because I defended myself? \n\nDeputy Carter: yes {Basically} \n\nSo we left the station in shock with the fact THAT I WOULD GET SENT TO JUVY!!!  My sister had a fit over that how that was very wrong. \n\nAnd here I am still stuck at this shitty place. \n\nBecause i would have been sent to juvy instead of actual justice. \n\n\nSorry this was long, I probably am overreacting. Maybe it was me all along but idk. I just still can't get over this. Am I being abused or am I just dramatic \n\n\n ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

As someone whose fallen into that trap multiple times with the same narc, I can confidently tell you that seeking revenge will most likely lead to you getting hurt even more than you already have been. \n\nRemember that narcissists really don\u2019t like to lose. By getting revenge you may think you\u2019re just evening the score, but to the narcissist they haven\u2019t done anything wrong. In their mind whatever they did to you was justified or no big deal. It doesn\u2019t matter how awful and evil they treated you. As soon as you get the revenge you want they\u2019ll start plotting their counter revenge. It becomes a nightmare game of tag and you\u2019ll lose because you have a conscience and they don\u2019t. They will take it much further than you could even imagine. Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking you know what they\u2019re capable of. These people get off on ruining lives.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for someone with empathy to truly appreciate the amount of damage a narcissist can do. They are not normal people. \n\nSomething I\u2019ll never forget about my Nex is that no matter how much I learned about narcissists he never stopped surprising me. That horrifying shock, the sinking feeling in my stomach, the confusion. Right up until the end he was doing things that just left me with my mouth wide open wondering if this was real or if I was stuck in a nightmare. I think it might be the worst feeling \nI\u2019ve ever experienced. The worst part was that every single time that happened he would act like he didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I remember thinking \u201coh wow this time he\u2019s done something so awful that he\u2019ll have to see it and feel bad about it.\u201d That never happens. \n\nAnyway my point is that you do not want to be at war with a malignant narcissist. You will only prolong your abuse and suffering.  \n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

And thank you for the advice as well.\n\nMy husband (here on referred to as DH, Dear Husband) was a narcissist, and still is sometimes. I left him quite suddenly, after putting up with his deteriorating behavior and emotional abuse for five years. He had no warning. And my escape was successful. \n\nDH and I needed that. Through the month of December that year, he started going to counseling so he could try to correct his behavior. I am overjoyed to say that he's made a lot of progress.\n\nWe saw individual counselors and did couples therapy too. DH joined group counseling for abusive partners and completed the 22 weeks.\n\nMy kids, who used to run away from him and not want to sleep next to him, now run to greet him and show their love just like they do for me. DH cooks, helps with cleaning, and has picked up and embraced more of his role as a father and husband. I really am proud of him.\n\nNow, that sounds like it's all cupcakes and rainbows, but we still have arguments, still have things we need to work on. But our counselors have given us tips and strategies to help each other work through our problems. \n\nI just wanted to put this out there. Some men (a very small percentage it seems) are able to change, if they can admit to themselves that they have a problem. Just like an addict/alcoholic can when they get the right help. DH would not have been able to change, or you could say learn how to manage himself, if I had not left. It was definitely a needed wake up call for him. He's not perfect, and I never expected him to be. But he tries. And that's what counts for me.\n\n\n\nAnd please, ladies and gents. Be safe. If your significant other can get their shit together, great. But make sure you always have a safe place, and someone who's got your back. Don't go running back to someone you've left just because I've said my DH learned to manage himself better. I saw that he was truely making an effort, and discussed it with people I trusted before I came back to him.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

There is so much shit, I won't bother to go into it, but if you're interested, just look at my post history.  All the usual bizarre narc things that is pretty much textbook.\n\nI went out with a friend of mine tonight. She and I (also female) have a rich history together in our relatively short friendship ( when you consider we are both 50-ish and have known one another since 2005).\n\nWe used to go to a bar when I was going through the process of divorcing this A HOLE.  We hadn't gone out in YEARS.  Neither together nor apart.  We got older and that just wasn't our \"thing\" any more.\n\nWe had a lovely dinner and decided to go to our old stomping ground (a bar we frequented back in the day).\n\nWe were engaged in a super personal, meaningful conversation about super sensitive things (she has gotten beaten by her husband) when I notice she was distracted by someone who tapped her on the shoulder.\n\nI turned to see who was interrupting us.  Low and behold, it was my ex husband.\n\nI was shocked.  One, because he had the balls to approach us when I've had a restraining order against him, and two additional failed attempts at restraining orders, and he pleaded no contest to disorderly conduct when he came into my home and threatened to kill me.\n\nTwo, because he looked like absolute shit.\n\nThree, because he was obviously intoxicated.\n\nHe was kind and friendly and pulled a bar stool up beside mine and said, \"Why don't we just sit here and drink together.  It was 30 years ago this June when I met you.\"\n\nWhat. The. Actual. Fuck. Is. Happening.\n\nI could not wrap my brain around it.\n\nSince I was the DD, I was just drinking water.  I could see clearly.  But could I???\n\nWHAT IS HAPPENING?\n\nSo I said to him, \"I respectfully ask you to not sit by me and just go away.\"\n\nAnd he did.\n\nShortly after, my friend and I left.

With those cold, dead eyes of disdain for anything \"me\".  Like he always does.  I said, \"Hey, uh, I just wanted to say that we could sit down and talk some day but-\"\n\nAnd he cut me off saying, \"Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was totally hammered and that wasn't the right time.  Nobody is going to hurt you...\"\n\nAnd with that, I walked way.\n\nI walked away with a spring in my step and a chuckle underneath my breath.\n\nThis guy is the total fuck show that I divorced and now that he sobered up, he's the same ole same ole.\n\nSEE YA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Also, he had a fall off of his bike as a kid and it caused a minor bleed on the brain. The medical staff claimed that there was no damage, but he always said that there was damage to his frontal lobe which is why he was always inappropriate. He and his family used this as an excuse for all of his behaviour and I didn't have any support as they thought that this was enough of an excuse to allow me to suffer the way he treated me.\n\nSo, when I was 16 I meet a guy at school. He was funny and kind and made me laugh, and we quickly became friends. It was about a year into our friendship that things started to go downhill. He never respected my space, and would often touch me inappropriately when I asked for space. At this time, I hadn't been friends with a male before and had been open to him about a lot of things, about the sexual assault I had suffered as a child and my mental illness problems. I was ok with the spooning and hand-holding and sexual innuendo and groping because he played it off as what 'normal' friendships are like. My parents wanted us to get together because 'we were so good together' and would encourage him to do things like kiss me and encourage him to ask me out on dates, all of which he did because he thought it was hilarious to see me cry after being kissed or getting angry that he'd ask me on dates. I figured that it would change when he started dating - spoiler alert, it didn't - and when he did get a gf who introduced him to drugs, everything just seemed to get worse.\n\nWe would have an annual party at a friends house for all of our birthdays because they were reasonably close together - so it was easier just to have a party to celebrate all of them on a day that none of them were on then have 5-6 parties, having one to three each week over the course of a month. We had strict rules with presents - could only be under $10 and could only get one thing for each person, unless we were combining our money to get something bigger together (which happened each time at least once per person). Anyway, these parties almost always contained vasts amounts of alcohol and I don't drink for religious reasons. The person who hosted it's mother knew this and knew that I liked diet drinks and would make sure there were two large bottles of Diet Pepsi available for me. Often, the one that I had open would go missing. I misplace things a lot so I wasn't too worried, so I just got the new one and drank that. I'd often leave feeling dizzy, but I blamed that on not eating enough and having low blood sugar. I later found out, my 'friend' would hide my full one and fill the half empty one with vodka or whatever spirit he had and then always made sure he had opened it before I got it. I'd forget half the night (this is important later). I didn't figure this out until the first time I had a few bottles of wine voluntarily and got the same side effects (not hungover, but I always get tummy cramps after drinking any alcohol, and get dizzy and lose time).\n\nHe'd also try and rock up to my place high or hang out with me high. He tended to be a bit more physical and aggressive when he was high so I didn't like it. Just in general didn't respect my boundaries and hated that I was religious.\n\nI then moved to a different state for a year where a medication gave me severe depression and psychosis. He distanced me from my friends by telling me lies about how they thought about me and then would constantly trigger me into killing myself. When I started putting in boundaries and saying 'I just need today to myself, I'm not coping' he'd respond with 'well, if you do this I'll kill myself and it'll be your false and no one will love you because you will be a murderer' but also text all of our mutual friends telling them that he saved me from suicide. He would remind me how much of a failure I was and would constantly berate and belittle me. Over that year, he would constantly say we were over as friends before three days later returning, begging for forgiveness and promising to change. I would always forgive him. I forgave him for blaming me for a friends suicide and told me if I cared about anyone I'd do the same. I ended up moving back home after a relative died, and he revealed in that. Any friends I made when I was out of state, he wanted me to cut contact with. My first act of rebellion was not to share with him the texts between a new male friend and I and continuing the friendship with him before it bubbled and died down six months later. I decided after moving back home I wanted to move two hours away to the north of the state to study nursing.\n\nHe. Went. Mental.\n\nAt one point he sent me an image of a child being tortured and saying 'this is the sort of thing you'll have to deal with' (I am interested in paediatric nursing but more interested in psychiatric nursing) before sending me like the hardcore porn you can find on reddit, stuff from 50/50 but always the gruesome stuff. He hated the idea of me moving again. I had also spent the time rekindling my friendships with other, whilst hearing about conversations they had had and reading messages he had sent in relation to me. I was slowly beginning to get annoyed as my parents continued to encourage us to date. The cutting things off but then being friends again kept happening and when I moved up to the north of the state, he'd continue with his whole belittling and berating thing. I had enough. I sent him a ten page letter telling him I needed a break and that for these reasons I think he did too.\n\nHe fucking lost it. He threatened to out me to my mother and father and church on facebook (I'm bi and non-binary and my church wasn't very accepting of this, my parents knew about the bi thing but not the non-binary thing and would have accepted it either way) and basically went on a rant about how I would never do something stupid like this as long as he was my friend because he would protect me from everything that I needed to be protected against.\n\nThis is what made me lose it. I was an adult, I didn't need him to 'protect' me of anything - especially because his version of protecting was controlling me and those around me. I sent him another letter that never got to him and in the end just ended up blocking him as he spammed me on facebook, kik, whatsapp etc.\n\nHe was still friends with our mutual friends, but one by one they began to drop away due to his increasing level of disrespect of others especially when he was high. But, for my friends 21st party, she invited him. She warned me he was coming and I said that I'll be there but if he started to be a dickhead, I was leaving.\n\nHe arrived high (when she asked him not to because there were a lot of &lt;12s there) and spent the entire night trying to make me ruin the evening. I spent the time talking to a friend who had just recently completed a trip to China through college and ignoring him when he lent on me and ignored me, flipping me off and calling me a c\\*\\*t. In the end, he left early blaming me when, in reality, it was the agreed time he and his parents said that he could stay for and still have them pick him up.\n\nI later found out he had told his mate that he was going to make me go mental to ruin her 21st, but he was the one who ruined it as a result. A lot of our friends told me how proud of me they were because they know I act on impulse and find it hard to control my emotional responses. I went home that day and just cried because I felt like it was still my fault that her birthday was ruined.\n\nHe later started making fake accounts and started messaging me, telling me to stop lying to others and that his friends were cutting contact with him because of the lies I spread (I'd often touch base about him through our friends, but more to make sure he was doing ok and then I'd change the subject). He started sending me messages about how he raped me when I was drunk and that he was trying to make me become straight so he could date me and not have to worry about me running off. He also began sending messages to my university and to my new friends, spreading lies about me. In the end, I asked everyone to block him from everything and to not speak about me to him.\n\nCut to six months ago, his new girlfriend messages me out of the blue. We look exactly alike, she messaged me saying that he thought we'd be great friends and how he wanted to meet up. I messaged back that if we were to meet up, it wouldn't be to rekindle the friendship, but rather to tie off loose ends. She didn't message me again, but I have gotten random messages from random people that - through basic, low level facebook stalking - I found out where his new lot of friends.\n\nI'm now 12 months from finishing my nursing degree and, although on a professional level I can handle it, I still don't trust men.

As in, a true FWB where there is some modicum of connection and respect.  He seemed on the same page.\n\nI knew right away that we wouldn't be compatible for a serious relationship, so this actually made it ideal.  How did I know?  I could tell he still has a lot of self growth to do that he's not really aware of.  Also, he tends to monopolize conversations where it's all about him and his interests.  Because of my expectations, I didn't really care at first...I found it kind of cute, even.  \n\nSo we seem to have sexual chemistry, which also makes it ideal.  But the other night we were talking, and he said that I looked like a poor country boy.  He was being kind of lighthearted about it, but it surprised me.  I'm very clean cut, not poor, and not really even country.  Like twenty minutes later I told a story about how I received weird stares at this high end grocery store and he said, \"you're gonna hate me, but maybe it's because you give off a homeless vibe.\". Again, shocked.  It really made no sense...  He was being lighthearted about it but it didn't come off as a prank or joke.  It really kind of hurt me, and he said, \"you always look so sad.\". I said, \"well now I am.\"\n\nWe continued talking (about his stuff) and he could tell I was shaken/hurt and he started to try and be maternal, \"aw, give me a hug...\". He was acting apologetic *but not going back on what he said.*.  You know, saying he was sorry, but never saying that I actually don't give off a homeless vibe.  A half hour later he was trying to be affectionate with me, and I gave in...I was thinking maybe it's just a weird instance and not that meaningful.  \n\nThe next morning I woke up and remembered what he said and it still puzzled me, but I forgot about it again.  There was even a moment that previous night where he casually talked about how he uses crude humor to test out his \"victims\".  \n\nWe were talking like an hour later and I noticed he was challenging a lot of my choices and being disagreeable.  It felt like...he was trying to get a rise out of me (if I'm not being paranoid).  He was mocking my diet (which is very measured and \"healthy\") and trying to say that he eats healthier than me.  The whole conversation he never expresses curiosity about the decisions I make.\n\nI just felt very...disturbed suddenly.  And as he was leaving he was talking about seeing me again in a week.  I told him, \"try and be less offensive and judgy next time.\". He had zero response and just walked off uncomfortably.  (I feel a lot of discomfort thinking back on that awkward walk away, kind of sad for him.)\n\nAfter this visit I felt deeply afflicted about us meeting again and I was just feeling disoriented about what is going on inside his head.  If he really feels the way he talks, why is he even seeing me?  He hardly ever...ever compliments me or tells me what he feels, but I do....not as often as I would for someone I'm seriously dating, though.\n\nI brought up the issue with him and he said all those things were just his twisted humor and that he felt bad about it.  That he uses what he considers humor to deal with his insecurities.  I mean, I kind of knew that...it's just that it manifests so frequently....and I honestly couldn't tell if most of it was humorous at the time.\n\nI told him that it kind of killed my interest and he started acting sad (in text).  He said it was up to me if I wanted to end things but that he likes me because I am \"kind and gentle\".  I honestly would rather be more than kind and gentle to someone.  Was that a way of him saying, 'someone that will take it'?\n\nAbove all, say he stopped doing those things...my main concern is not knowing what his real intentions are.  Even in an agreement that is mostly sexual, I'd like there to be some...like, a little relational health.  I briefly brought it up with a friend and she talked about how it reminded her of the humor of a gay man she used to know and that I just need to draw a line of what is acceptable.\n\nBut there is insecurity and then there is insecurity that is poorly dealt with.  Like, almost abusive insecurity.  I have a lot of insecurities, too....but I'm not going to wage war with them or hurt someone else with them.  Maybe even my disturbed/hurt reaction....or my need to know that I am more than just validation to him is a reflection of my own need for validation.  \n\nAt first I was thinking that it's worth seeing if he changes his demeanor, but the more I've thought on it I have a sick feeling about it.  Because he is still being cryptic when I ask him what he is truly looking for.  Part of me also feels guilt about ending it....he said, \"I'm actually a caring person!\" and because I knew from the beginning that he has kind of blind insecurity issues (if not this overt).  I'm even, admittedly, a little scared of him now.. \n\nWondering what anyone else perceives...\n\ntl;dr: what were once cute and benign insecurities/lack of tact crossed the line with, \"you give off a homeless vibe\".

Since then her former partner has been calling repeatedly, threatening to come and cause problems at her work, threatening to break into her house and steal her dog, extorting money from her and finally, most recently, threatening suicide.

I have a fairly healthy sex drive, and physical contact is one of the main ways I feel loved. She agreed that sex is important and said that she wasn\u2019t ready yet, but when she was she was looking forward to it. I was totally fine waiting because I know how important it is that all parties are ready. \n\nA few months in, the subject came up again. I honestly don\u2019t remember who brought it up. She apologized that she still wasn\u2019t ready and said that one of the ways that might help her get ready is small-scale sexual activity. She said she was okay undressing in front of me and asked if we could start with her getting used to me just touching her lightly. We started with that and it quickly progressed to me going giving her oral. I was excited that we seemed to be making progress, but even months after this started I was not allowed to undress at all. She also expressed extreme discomfort at touching me or reciprocating. But I continued to go down on her because I figured any sexual activity was better than none.  \n\nSlowly, however, the times when she allowed even that lessened. We started having longer dry spells, the longest being eight months. I asked if I had done something and she assured me I hadn\u2019t. But I also started to notice her expressing some very anti-sex sentiments around this time. One of our mutual friends got pregnant (and now has an amazing little girl) and when she announced her pregnancy my partner told me privately that that\u2019s why she was glad we weren\u2019t having sex, and that \u201cit didn\u2019t affect her anyway.\u201d If we heard about someone having different sexual partners or saw someone on television being promiscuous she would slut-shame them. \n\nI started asking periodically about whether she was any more comfortable with sex and I got several different answers. Sometimes she would say she was too scared of pregnancy, others that she was afraid of the pain, or that she was too stressed (which is fair; we\u2019re both grad students). Her conflicting answers got me questioning what made her so uninterested, when she initially seemed very inclined towards sex. Before we started going out she even told me that she was \u201ctired of being a virgin.\u201d \n\nFor unrelated reasons, we broke up very briefly last September. She hoovered me and we got back together on the same day, but she insisted that until I proposed to her I would no longer be allowed to touch her or see her naked. I agreed, thinking I had done something horrible by hurting her. But then she started up with talking about sex again. She told me that just before I broke up with her she was getting ready to \u201clet me\u201d have sex with her. She said she was disappointed that I had broken up with her because right now she wanted me to \u201cfuck her,\u201d the only time in the history of our relationship she had said that. Even just telling me that her breasts looked particularly good on a given day. About two months after that we resumed our usual routine of me going down on her maybe once or twice a month, and the conversations ended.\n\nI\u2019d love to ask her where she ultimately falls on the subject of sex, but I\u2019m terrified of her response. Either she\u2019ll lie to me and say she\u2019s just waiting for a proposal (which she\u2019s done before) or she\u2019ll be honest and tell me it doesn\u2019t matter to her and I know I won\u2019t have the strength to tell her off for lying to me before. \n\nThere are other subjects I\u2019d love to ask about but am terrified of her reaction to them. Have others experienced something similar? Is there a way to work up the nerve to ask?\n\ntl;dr Possibly narcissistic partner has given me different stories about her feelings on sex. Scared to ask for clarification about them. Am I overreacting? Is there a way to get over my nerves and ask anyway? ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

However,  I think narcissism came before addiction with him,  so I'm coming here for advice.  Chicken and egg situation. \n\nI have been granted an out.  Except it is a pattern that will cause me guilt (like I don't have enough of that with all my co dependent bull shit). He woke me up this morning at 6:30/7:30 (time change - definitely felt like 6:30). He was drunk and high on coke.  That is a usual weekend occurrence for him.  Wakes me up and tells me that he doesn't wanna do this anymore,  he wants to die his coke abuse has gotten so out of hand.  Also because of guilt for how badly he has treated me.  Tells me he needs me to call all of his family members to stage an intervention.  I say no,  if you want to tell your family as part of a recovery process,  that's on you,  but me blind siding family members who are not actively being hurt by your addiction is selfish of you and won't do anything because you aren't taking responsibility.  He is hurt that I don't care etc etc I again assert that he has to get help if he wants help I will not do it for him.  I then leave the house and don't return for many hours.  \n\nCome home and his aunt and 2 uncles are there, he is going to a meeting tonight, her told them everything etc etc. Super awkward for me.   He actually said in front of them that he had been lying to me and was doing the blow at least 3 times a week.  I say what the fuck? He doesn't really apologize but admits that it was awful.  Then proceeds to tell me he needed to ask family for help because he will listen to them,  he couldn't listen to me.  (Paraphrasing but you get this gist)\n\nI play nice,  talk with the uncle about what meeting, he talks about the good stuff of AA.  They get him to agree to give up drinking and pot as well.  Because I specifically asked if he would quit drinking.  I then say I think you should do 90 in 90. He needs to be informed what this is,  then says I don't know about that,  that's a lot.  No one else pushes that.  Hugs,  he cries some more,  they leave.  \n\nHe then says I would completely understand if you left.  That has been a theme today,  him being self -deprecating and suggesting that he would understand if I walked out the door.  I said you don't really seem like you feel that bad about lying to me? He said oh you have no idea but the look in  his eyes is that look,  you know the one,  the blank look of I'm saying what I know I'm supposed to be saying right now even though I don't really feel it.  Again there has not been an apology just an admission of wrongdoing.  I almost said guilt but that wouldn't be true.  \n\nOh there's so much more but I'm already rambling.  Bullet points on things that are considerations for me:\n1. I left an ex for lying to me about his drug use before.  One of the last things he said was you work in mental health don't you want to help me get better? I still have guilt over this. \n2. I left this N before (about 9 months ago),  I look like an asshole for leaving now.  He tattled on himself for the drugs,  nothing about the shit he has put me through when he wasn't drunk or high though.  \n3. Is he a narcissist because of the drugs? He had asshole moments before the drug thing really got out of hand the last 2 years.  I felt I was trying to prove my worth back before he got heavy into drugs.  However I was drunk/ stoned a lot back then due to my feelings of inadequacy.  I have gotten sober and have more perspective now but maybe I blew things out of proportion back then? \n4. Maybe going through this process I will actually get that person who love bombed me.  The potential I saw.  \n5. Maybe he will be even more fucking unbearable sober.  More time and energy to pick me apart.  \n\nI want to decide tonight while he is out of the house.  He's leaving in about an hour.  I have somewhere to go anytime I want.  I think I want to leave but I really don't know.  I don't feel much at all right now.  ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I can list specific incidents if you want to hear about them. I only realized that this was abuse earlier this 2019 and began not talking to him. My father wanted me to be a certain way, and when I did not turn out that way, he did not accept me for it.

The discard is heartless and they don't want you to feel any kind of peace after the breakup.

They were never that kind person, though. They're just good at hiding behind a mask. \n4. **The cheating.** Narcs will often cheat, either physically or emotionally, and wave it in your face. Instead of feeling remorse for cheating, they will often call you \"jealous\" or \"clingy\". Somehow, it's your fault. The cheating in itself is hard to recover from. \n5. **Triangulation.** The narc will often involve someone else in the relationship so you have to compete for the narcissist's attention. This could be a family member, another friend, or another romantic interest. \n6. **Smear campaign.** They will make you look like the crazy one in the relationship. They will play the victim and make it look like they pity you for being so emotionally unstable. They will try to ruin your reputation or leave you isolated from mutual friends. \n7. **Hoovering.** They will try to come back.

No contact from February 2018-19. Father forced break of no-contact. I have c-PTSD from 8 years of my father's ongoing emotional abuse. I hear his voice in my head.\n\nTo start off with, I'm from a mixed race family. My father's parents (thathi and thatha) are from South India and don't speak the best English. They live with my parents about 6-8 months out of the year. My father treats them poorly, his sister treats them worse, and everyone treats my mom like trash. Thathi and thatha don't know why I'm gone, but neither does anyone except for my sister. My mom told them that I left because I wanted to change my major in college. About a month ago, my mom told me that my thathi and thatha were coming to visit me within two weeks. I let her know that this was impossible. as I have no place for them to stay, they cannot drive, they don't have the best english, and they are getting quite old (thatha is 85 now, I think). I have to work full time while going to school full-time, and live in an environment that they would not like at all. I'm also engaged to someone I've been with for six years, but they don't even know that he exists. \n\nI found out a week later that my father was trying to put me in an impossible situation so that I would go out there to visit them, since all of them knew there was no feasible way for them to visit me. The next week, my thathi and thatha asked to facetime me, and I obliged, thinking I'd only be talking to them. It turned out that my thathi was trying to reunite the family, because she thinks that I'm the one causing all of the pain, and she just wants me to \"come home and talk to her son again.\" My dad was on the phone call. He talked over them and I didn't end up really speaking to my thathi and thatha at all. My dad knew I wouldn't dare hang up on my thathi and thatha. I had a serious traumatic episode that culminated in rage and I ended up throwing a bunch of stuff and losing my mind. Later that night, I texted my mother and told her I didn't want to talk to my dad. She said that this was bringing out the worst in me and that I was becoming the worst version of myself. She said that I needed to stop holding grudges because the only one I was hurting was myself. \n\nFlash forward to this week. My mom asked if I could just talk to my thathi and thatha, as my dad was out of town. I said yes, figuring that it would be safe. This phone call turned into my thathi and thatha trying to send me money via a check from my parents, or online provided that I gave them (and subsequently my parents) all of my bank account information. The conversation went around in circles because my thathi couldn't really understand me, and said that I wasn't respecting them and I didn't love them. She said I need to stop working and just go to school and be dependent on my parents again, and I said I was sorry but I couldn't do that. I eventually said that I couldn't deal with the way my father treated my mom, but she didn't understand what I was saying. She said that my father already sent an apology letter (he did. I read it. He's not sorry. It wasn't an apology letter.) and that since he was sorry, I needed to talk to him next week. I said that I couldn't. I didn't tell them that my c-PTSD really flared after the forced contact last week, because they don't have any information about that. This conversation resulted in my thathi crying and saying that they're getting old (they certainly are) and they want to reunite the family. I tried hard to articulate in simple English that sometimes the best for everyone means that certain people are apart, and that wasn't really understood, either. She asked if I was happy and I said yes, I was, which made her cry harder, and she couldn't understand why someone who used to call me by a pet name was someone I didn't speak to anymore, especially because that someone is her son. It wasn't the time for me to tell her that he destroyed me mind body and soul, and that he sucked all the life and joy out of my mother, so she's not even in touch with reality anymore. \n\nI know our next conversation is going to go even worse because I can't accept any money from them if it's coming from my parents. I also don't think I should be taking money out of their pension. They need that. Since they're not residents of the US, they don't have a bank account here so it would come from my parents, so basically, my dad. I worked so hard to separate myself from his financial web because he used to use that as a part of the abuse. I want nothing to do with this. When people throw in things like \"you don't love us,\" it makes this incredibly painful. \n\nLong story short, I'm in crazy emotional pain, my family thinks I'm the spawn of satan, and I don't want my family to know that my dad's an abuser, because despite all the pain he causes, I don't want to hurt him like he hurt me. I don't want to destroy my family, even though I'm not close to them. \n\nAnd also every time I call my sister she basically says it's my responsibility to fix my mom. The problem is that my mom is not rational anymore, and I'm not stable enough to emotionally support the two of us. Both of us would go down. So even my sister thinks that I suck. This is reiterated every time I talk to her. \n\nI have no idea what to do. I'm worried that between work and school and everything else, I'm going to have a breakdown that I can't just bounce back from. I'm exhausted and I even hear these voices in my sleep. I wake up crying and my fiance has to talk to me until I fall asleep again. I have random panic attacks and don't know where I am. I feel like I'm losing the mind that I worked so hard to repair through therapy and psychiatry and 12-step. I'm losing my sense of self-worth. If I get dragged in again, I know I'll never escape. My fiance is the only one I feel comfortable talking to about this stuff and we're both so busy that we don't always have time to talk about this stuff or it's so late that we're both falling asleep. Work is so busy that I've had to cancel my therapy appointment two weeks in a row. I want to fix my family and I just don't know how. To me, the only way to do it is to remove everyone from my father's influence, but...look where that's got me. Help?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

He said that he was just drunk when he wrote that stuff to me, he doesn't even remember saying these things about his feelings for me, as they are no longer there for him anymore. I tried to engage further and he ignored my messages.  \n\n\nAfter two days, I wrote in to apologise for bombarding him with those messages and he told me that he is done talking with me now and doesn't want to have anything to do with me anymore because I keep asking the same questions and it keeps going around in circles and he just wants to have some peace. He said that he has told me time and time again not to communicate with him (however he never once did express this), he has tried to be polite and has tried to respond to my messages but now he's 'done'.  I apologised profusely to him as I felt terrible for misreading the situation and overstepping his boundaries and he responded saying 'I told you to stop communicating with me, yet you still keep going'. I then expressed that I will respect his decision to stop interacting and apologised for all of this. He read my last message, ignored it and then deleted me off all social media. Anyway... Two months after he messaged me telling me he was truly sorry for everything and that even though it is no excuse, he was in a bad place and that he was a 'pig'. I was doing really well at the time and told him that I appreciated his apology and that i was wishing him all the best. This gave me so much closure, it was amazing and I felt I had moved on, it was great.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately I ended up reaching out to him again as I know that he struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts and I was worried about him after a dream I had. I had this compulsion to write to him and tell him that if he is in a dark place again, he can reach out to me and I will be there for him because I still care. He wrote back saying 'likewise' and asked me how I am. I told him I am fine, in return he told me he was good as he got a new job at his favourite liquor store. From there I told him that I don't think we should start talking again incase things get nasty again, but I want him to know that I am there if he needs someone. The day after I felt these overwhelming feelings for him return and I wrote back to him again telling him I still have feelings for him and it has been eating me up, after everything that happened and its bad. Afterwards, I had intense regret for writing this message and he responded saying \"sorry....It was my fault for messaging. Don't feel bad x\". I then told him that I know it will pass, but the contact just brought it on and that I am keen to just put it behind me. He then said 'yeah....best to not talk or we'll just go around in circles. Sorry I shouldn't have messaged...I messed up. I think we should just block all contact from here x'. I apologised for being such a nuisance and he said 'No I was the nuisance, It all got ugly and it was my fault for being so selfish. Take care and I hope we cross paths one day and everything's ok. x'\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonths had passed and I really struggled to let go of my feelings and have been in constant conflict with myself trying to gain some sort of closure or understanding of the situation.  Two months ago I noticed that he unblocked me on messenger and I got in touch to tell him that If he doesn't want to speak to me, to tell me upfront - but I miss knowing him and still feel confused about everything that happened. He responded saying 'I woke up to my friend dead and am dealing with that at the moment. I'm getting lots of messages and I think I might delete messenger x'. I told him that I am very sorry to hear of his situation, that I hope he's coping ok and told him that he's welcome to reach out to me if he feels the same way I do and wants to talk about it further. He responded saying 'thank you x'. I then went on to say that obviously it's important to focus on what is happening for him now, but I'd really appreciate it if he could be upfront with me if he isn't interested, rather than leave it hanging and that I hope he's getting the right support. He has left that message on read for the last 2 months and in the mean time I have seen him on tinder (he 'nope'd me) and I see him 'liking' attractive women he knows on my instagram feed all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes this seem like narcissistic behaviour, or am I the one here that's been behaving in the wrong with this guy?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Of course I don't miss *him* and all the bullshit I had to go through. But something got me thinking about when in our \"relationship\" he might have started to move on to the next victim. Because that's what they do. Use, abuse, discard, rinse and repeat. For some reason the thought of him with another girl still hurts. Probably because it was something I had to vehemently fight against for a majority of our \"relationship\".\n\nHe was always trying to bring other girls in, always assuring me they were just friends, and then later telling me something along the lines of, \"Since we're not *technically* together right now, you can't get mad at me if I fuck someone else.\" So I'd make it official with him again, he'd constantly assure me he never cheated on me, and a few months later guess who got an STD!\n\nJust the fact that he cheated on me at all, regardless of being a narcissistic prick and subjecting me to over a year of abuse, is really, really hard to process. I just cannot believe that the entire time I was head over heels for this catch, he really wasn't there with me at all. He was just looking for the next girl. He never wanted to make it work.\n\nIt's just difficult. It's one thing to educate myself on narcissism and understand logically why he did all the things that he did and that it wasn't just because of me. But it's another thing to still have that emotional baggage and not know where to go with it. I absolutely hate him which is why it pains me to admit that there's still some jealousy deep down. There's still some longing and wishful thinking. It's all quiet now, but if I stop long enough to listen I can still hear my deepest, darkest thoughts, begging for an answer of what went wrong? Why me? Why?\n\nMaybe it's not necessarily jealousy that I feel, but a mix of anger and pity at whoever his new victim is, because they're probably thinking the same things I did. Forgiving him, making excuses for him, thinking she's strong enough to change him and help him be better. She just wants to be a good person. She just wants to be loved. I just want to scream at her that he's psychotic and she should run and never turn back, but the thing is, people *did* tell me those things. I just didn't listen.

abuse or not. my gf and i(im male) have been dating for a year now. our anniversary was yesterday. we are an online relationship and ive gone up to see her last year. things were great in the beginning. we hardly ever fought. however, i had this friend who was both mine and her friend. only weeks after, he began to try to control my relationship. telling me how things were and what i should do. he specifically told me i was moving to fast. this is my first relationship so i dont even know how credible or real we even are. after he kept trying to control us, i snapped back. i unleashed my pent up anger and blew up. the neighbors called noise complaints and my family was about to force me to hang up the phone. this led to us being separated and she was the only one who was there for me. i feel like this fight between me and my friend, sparked my depression. about a month later i tried to kill myself. earlier that day my mom confronted me, telling me that i was being a bad son and not loving her. my sister was over at her boyfriends house, and my gf was out at her families. so i was a lone in the dark. i tried to overdose but i was to dumb to succeed. the entire time i felt guilty and freaked out. i ended up writing \"sorry\" hundreds of times, littering my room with papers. each \"sorry\" more messy than the other. my gf tried to reach out to me but i didnt respond. long story short, my mom found out, had a family meeting where my entire family told me they loved me, and i began going to counseling. ever since then, i havent been alowed to be home alone and both my family and my gf have been paranoid that i would hurt myself. after counseling did little to no work, i started taking anti-depressents. they helped alot, but they also made it harder for me to be happy. my relationship with my online gf was difficult, as we were online and couldnt do any of the usual relationship things. we say \"i love you\" and we make kisses to the cameras, but its not the same. fortunately i was able to go see her over the summer. we got to hang out and enjoy being a couple for a few days. we both had our first kiss and we knew how nice it was to be in person. then i had to go home. on the plane home, i got a major rush of anxiety. i began to fidget and rub nervousely, making my fingers sore. i constantly thought about what would happen if i died, then and there. when i got home, i got perscribed anxiety pills. ever since i got home, and since my ending with my friend. my gf and i have begun to fight and be more upset. we cry and yell at each other alot. she has an irl friend who she is really close with. he makes her laugh a lot and even before we were dating, she though of him as a possible bf. they both reassured me that nothing would ever happen between them, but i still get paranoid and get jealouse when she hangs out wtih him or is tyipng to him. this has lead to many fights as she feels i cant trust her. about a month ago, she was out of school and so was he. they were playing video games and i was still in school. i got really upset and jealouse, then she lashed back and told me how she \"cant get it though my thick fucking skull\" about how i shouldnt be jealouse. many times when we fight, i end up feeling bad. i end up saying sorry and its been said so many times, it has no meaning. i really love her, but it hurts alot to be with her. im always the one sacrificing myself to make her happy, we are alwasy doing what she wants to do. both of us are bad at realising what we say, but she is hardly ever capable of realising what im feeling. ive been talking to my counselor and him and everyon around me have suggested the idea of taking a break, or breaking up. i use to talk to my sister about our relationship and she has told me countless times that this is a toxic relationship. she likes to read and whenever she is typing or texting things, im ignored. same goes with then she is on instagram. when we call, its like im just there for background noise. she is alwasy bored of the video games we can play together.  iconstantly feel like im not good enough to make her happy. because i have no irl friend and basically have no life, i spend all my time on a call with her. ive abandoned my family and responsibilities to be there for her. when i look back to how our relationship is, and define our efforts in our relationship, i can adamantly say its me 95% her 5%. ive risked everyhting i have, ive destroyed my life, ive ruined my relationships, ive given up and everyone but her. yet sometimes she makes me feel worthless and like im not good enough. im scared to ever talk to her about the issues we have, because it always lands back on me. i know what its like for us to be together in person. 15 months and im able to move out. whenver she is sad, i do everything i can to comfort her, but its never the right thing to do. she tells me that i become her counselor and that im not good at comforting her. it hurts to say, but she is my everything. for the past month, ive been contemplating breaking up with her. the problem is that whenever we are happy together, i feel like i dont need to, like we are okay. but when we fight, it breaks me down to feeling like its the only choice. but im never given enough time to act on it. so im on teh constant cicly of pain and happiness and i dont know what to do to save myself. ive given up on my family and my own life, ive given up on myself. i know that she controls me and my life. my friend has been in and out of my life, constantly trying to screw up our relationship, but in reality, hes beeing trying to warn and help me realise that its not okay for it to be like this. its my first relationship, im scared of the pain and whats going to happen. ive made promises to never leave her and htat we will be happy together in teh future. in 5 months we are planning another trip. she also has depression and suicidal thoughts, but she doesnt see a counselor or take medication. im the only person she comes to about bad things in her life. she has told me that she doesnt know how safe she will eb if i leave. many itterasions of how if we break up, she might hurt herself. things like \"you keep me from hurting myself\". im scared that if i leave her and say that we can try again in person, that she wont be there when i get back. is this an emmotionally abusive relationship or am i just crazy? (that though has circled my head a thousand times). do we take a break until i can see her this summer? should i just end it till i can be there in person? keep going and hope the happiness outshines the pain? i honestly dont know what to do anymore.  \n\n\ni know that this is random and bad writing but its just what is coming out of my brain. hopefully you people of reddit can help me in some way.

But it's triggering me/making me spiral...I just feel like I'm never going to have a real relationship. I'm never going to be in a healthy relationship. My whole life, I've been in horrible friendships and then one relationship that was abusive and ended with him assaulting me. My best friend from age 3/4 to 15 was emotionally and sexually abusive. My best friend after that was manipulative and stalked me...I think she was probably emotionally abusive, I don't know, but she stalked me and maybe still does and scared me really badly with it. My ex touched me constantly in places I told him I didn't want to be touched, and then if he *didn't* touch me there, he made me feel like he was doing me a favor.

I married when I was 19 to someone that was very Ill, she eventually passed away. She suffered for 4 years, she died so young. I had been alone for years after, I had no one. I would go and sit at Starbucks, I took some type of social pleasure in just hearing someone call my name when I would order coffee. Just sitting around people made me feel less alone, although at the same time more alone than ever.\n\n I one day received a message from a family friend, she was very beautiful, and very caring of my situation. I had never spoken to this woman before. She seemed overly interested in me, and my past. Being alone for so long I found comfort in talking too her. Eventually my family found out that her and I had a interest in one another. My mother seemed a bit concerned, but at the time never said anything at the time. I became infatuated with this lady, and the care and interest she had in me. She was the kind of lady that everyone would notice if she walked into a room. Beautiful, she would brighten up the room. I could not believe that this was happening, things went from missery and depression and thoughts of suicide, to the actual hope for my future again. Months went by as we began to go on dates, and eventually we were officially dating. Almost the same time I began dating her is when she had a falling out with one of my family members, they were best friends. I was never told what actually happened, it never made any sense. But I took my girlfriends side in the matter as it seemed I was almost forced to. Shortly thereafter she began complaining when any of my family members would talk to me, call me or message me. I did not think it was a big deal as she recently ended that friendship with that family member.\n\n  I began only hanging out with her and her mom. I went to dinner with her and her mother one night, we drove in her mom's car. I noticed the front passenger door of her car was almost ripped off it's hinges. When the door was opened the door would drop down almost hitting the ground. I asked her mom what had happened to the door? She gave me a surprised look and told me her daughter was upset (My girlfriend) and they were arguing with each other, and my girlfriend slammed the door to hard. I didn't have much of a response. The whole time I was wondering how the hinges we're broken so badly from slamming the door, it would seem like the door would have had to be pushed and forced the opposite way of the car to be that badly damaged. Later that night we were sitting at dinner, my girlfriend was very upset that her mom and I were talking. She would get quite and then yell at her mom. It was very cringy in the moment. Again, I didn't think much of it. Months went by, things were going great. \n\nI knew she was the one by comparison of what my life used to be like. I didn't think I would get another chance, I felt lucky. I was happy... happier than I had been in 5 years. After the proposal, my family started warning me of my fiancees attitude. They said that she has acted out in the past, that they have seen her hit her mom, and been raging mad. I confronted my fiancee about it, she said they were just trying to turn me against her, and they were making it all up so we would break up. She seemed to have a good point, I did feel a lot of push back from my parents and sister. I began distancing myself from my family. \n\nWe eventually got married. My family was concerned, but they supported me. My family is very caring, they are amazing people that are super friendly, they deeply care about me and everyone they come into contact with. And I was a idiot for not caring for their opinion on the matter. They hoped for the best in my marriage. My wife would not allow me to talk to them, if I did she would go ballistic. She would call my sister a fake whore, my mom was a fake ass whore, and she seemed to be somewhat okay with my dad for whatever reason. She was actively trying to turn me against them. She hated my friends, and anyone that I knew that she didn't know. \n\nSorry if things get graphic. \n\nI began to miss my family. I would talk to my mom, but I wouldn't tell her what was happening inside my marriage. My wife saw the phone calls and thought I was saying things to my mom behind her back. She would keep me up all night yelling at me, and finding reasons to be mad. Usually it would be that I wasn't willing to do the dishes at 3 in the morning. She would throw heavy objects at my head that would have severely hurt me or cracked my head open. I was able to avoid the things she would throw, other than her phone hitting me in the face beyond several times. We would go out places. I thought it would be better since she might not act out in public. She would grab the wheel out of my had and steer us into oncoming traffic, then begin to hit me in the head while I'm driving. I would pull over and try to get her out of the car, she would run in front of the car or open the door in time and try ripping the door off of the car... She would eventually calm down, or walk home. \n\nShe would always bring up my family and make up things that never happened and accuse of telling my parents what she does to me, or saying I was flirting with a girl that I never even talked to. She would always get physical and start throwing things, or trying to punch me in the face. I would usually tackle her to the ground and just hold her from moving to stop the madness, she would scream at the top of her lungs and bite me, she would always dig her teeth in until blood was dripping from my arm into her mouth. I had countless bite marks all over my body.\n\nI would not do what she was doing to me, I might be bigger, but I would not stoop down to that level. It would not have made things better for either one of us if I hit her. I was extremely embarrassed that this was happening, I was doing my best to fix it myself. I was always calm and tried to use reasoning to get her to stop. I would walk on eggshells around her. The pain was not the problem for me, it was being hated to death by the person I just married a month earlier. The day came when I was done, I hadn't slept in weeks. I was in a living nightmare. This kind of thing happened every day. We were parked in my car outside of our apartment, I don't remember the one sided argument, I wasn't even mentally there. I just remember sitting there getting punch in the face over and over and over and over again. She had a wedding ring that would cut deep, I was numb to it. Life had become pointless again. \n\nShe did not want me going to work the next day, she started saying she was concerned for my well being, but doing her best to cover up the damage to my face. My eye was of course black, and red and cut. But I had to go to work, I couldn't lose my job. I was lying to people about what happened to me. I am a horrible lier. Right when my dad saw me he knew exactly what had happened to me without me telling him. I knew things would just get worse and I would end up dead. There was no fixing the situation, so I broke down and told my parents. My parents somehow weren't surprised. My dad even called my wife's mom. My dad told her there has been domestic violence going on at my and my wife's apartment. Her mother didn't even question if I had been beating her, it is like she already knew what her daughter was capable of without ever telling me anything of it. \n\nMy parents helped me hide my vehicle due to her most likely damaging it in some way due to me staying with my parents. I had none of my belongings. After a few days I drove back to the apartment. I went in and she was just sitting on the couch not acknowledging me. I went into the closet and she ran in ripping all my clothes out and throwing them, then began pushing me and punching me. I tried holding her down again, but she was in a super human rage. I could not hold on to her, she began pulling my fingers back trying to break them but I got away. She threw lit candles at my head, I ran into the bathroom holding the door shut due to the lock being easily unlocked. I kept hearing something hit the door, and I yelled asking her what she was doing. The door was a cheap plywood door, and I began feel something poking through. Eventually I back away from the door, she the kicked a hole in the door and crawled in with the knife she was stabbing the door with. \n\nI quickly grabbed her had and was fighting over the knife as she was biting a chunk out of my arm. I pushed her and ran out of the apartment. The apartment had a door leading out to the balcony, and a door from the balcony to the stairs. I barely made it to the balcony door as I open it there stood my neighbors that looked like they were about to kick the living crap out of me. They could hear yelling and screaming, they thought because I am a guy I was the instigator. I could barely get the words out to tell them what was going on. Then she ran out of the apartment onto the balcony screaming and yelling at the top of her lungs, trying to open the door. The neighbors then started holding the door shut as they then figured out what was going on. The whole neighborhood could hear her screaming.\n\nSo many people came just watching this play out. The cops were called and she was taken to jail. I got a restraining order. I knew she was mental, but I knew that wasn't 100% who she actually was. Going to jail seemed to surely help her see reality. \n\nIt has been a year and a half since this all happened. Again, we were only married for a month. For reasons I can't really explain, I have given her plenty of chances. Things always seem to head back into the direction of her being abusive. She hates my family. She tries to control my life, when she can't she goes ballistic. \n\nI am still married to her for reasons I honestly don't want to add to this. I fight with my feelings of loving her and being sickly depressed. I already had someone close to me die. And she threatens to end her life if we're not together. She has not been nearly as physical, but shows signs of things going back to the way they were. We do not live together, and it is almost as if we are dating again. I honestly want to run away. The nightmare is not over, I would prefer to kill myself. Please take time to get to know someone fully before getting married. I am locked into something that I can't get out of for reasons that are not meant to be said. I don't know how much longer I can do this. I am a human with a life, and so is she. I would rather die than continue upsetting peoples life with drama that surrounds me. And my body can't handle any more. I have many physical problems that seem to be permanent to me now. I try not to show it. My eye sight is leaving me as fast as my will to keep going through all this pain. \n\nI am still young, but my life is ruined. I wanted love, but now I hate myself as much as I am hated. People do have bigger problems than me, and I take comfort in knowing the ones that don't. I do not hate her, I have never had a reason to hate someone until I met my mistakes.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I feel confused and violated, first time this happened.", "author": "lolitaintown", "self_text": "This is the first time this happened to me, and I feel scared, confused, quite violated too.  I can't even type sexual abuse as the title of this post because it's acknowledging it as such, and I feel I'm still in denial, if it really was. Maybe it's not like an obvious abuse, but certainly felt like it to me. I hope someone can help me or give me advice. You don't need to emphasize that it's my fault because I already know I am partly to blame. I just hope no one will downplay my feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL/DR:** Guy I met once, rarely talked to and still deemed as a friend, asked so many intimate sexual questions, making me think it was related to \"helping me understand my relationships and myself better.\" I trusted him and realized only afterwards that it wasn't. I even started to think he was touching himself while we were on the phone because I thought I heard sounds, but there's no way for me to know or prove that it wasn't just all in my head.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Long version:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's this guy I met travelling many years back, we live in opposite sides of the world and we exchanged numbers and sometimes would chat about what's going on about life. When we were still in touch more often after meeting, I've shared some of my romantic relationship issues with him including some intimate sexual details about it, since I come from a conservative country and there's not a lot of people I can talk to about that. After that, he would just chat me and ask if I can talk on the phone every few months, but we're not really close so I would always come up with an excuse not to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to today, I finally gave in and had a convo with him. First he shared that he got married, and I shared that I just broke up with my ex. He's the \"leader/adviser\" type of person whom you'd go to if you needed some perspective, so he said he wanted to help me get through it, understand myself better etc. Then he started asking questions related to my sexual experiences/preferences. At first I was okay to answer them all because I really thought he was sincere in wanting to help me and maybe those questions were related to whatever \"understanding yourself better\" objective he had, but later on the questions were too specific that I really don't see the connection anymore. He would ask me what I did in bed, how wet I'd get, what I did with my fingers, did I feel any tingling down there while I was talking to him abt my ex, do i get turned on seeing anyone's penis, and many others i don't want to go into detail in. The reason I kept answering his questions was because I trusted he'd connect it to whatever advice he was going to give in relation to the \"subconscious\" sh\\*t he was saying.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was only the next day I realized I felt so awful about the whole conversation. I trusted him that night but I was only left confused. Then it dawned on me that he's a married guy and he's asking me all those questions and it just felt so wrong. So I gave him a call and said I felt uncomfortable and didn't he think something was wrong with the convo? He said no because we had a conversation like that in the past...but I said it was inappropriate esp. with him being married and I said we shouldn't have to talk about something like that again, and said he asked too many unrelated sexual questions. I asked him how all of it was related, but he gave the generic \"we were talking abt relationships and so you could see a diff. aspect.\" But I don't see at all how it happened, he hardly gave any advice afterwards. I also asked if he was touching himself during the phone call, because i really thought I heard it but I wasn't sure at that time...but he said he wasn't and even seemed perplexed I asked, asked if had experience like that before which I didn't. I give him the benefit of the doubt about that. But he said he never meant to make me feel uncomfy and he thanked me for telling him what i feel. I said best to not keep in touch anymore, he says he respects it, I don't have to explain myself and we can not talk if it will only make me uncomfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel awful and I partly blame myself,  because I did answer the questions after all. I am angry at myself for letting someone think they are my friend who is helping me but if I am to be honest, I feel quite used and violated. I don't even know if this is classified as abuse but I am left afraid and ashamed after that. I have blocked him online and his number. He even said \"if it helps, I apologize\" but that hardly counts because I know he thinks he didn't do anything wrong. I'm not expecting an apology who doesn't see anything wrong either.  I couldn't get mad either because i was scared.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to do. I don't know how to sort out my feelings and move on from this. It helps that I cut contact with him and I am proud of myself for communicating what I felt (even if I didn't get mad even if I wanted to) and took action, but like any trauma the words and experience stick to your mind and eat you up. I want to forgive myself, but don't really know where to start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope someone out there can help me out or give a friendly advice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I made a reddit just to talk about this, I\u2019m kinda feeling stuck. I\u2019m really sorry if this is the wrong place.\n\nFor background, I was in a friendship with a narcissistic abuser for 7-ish years, basically for all my teen years. Most of that time, I was convinced I didn\u2019t have a right to call what they did to me abuse. But now that I\u2019ve had time away from them to clear my head I\u2019m certain of what was done. To help solidify the fact in my mind, I wrote what I\u2019m calling a \u201ctestimony\u201d to what I went through and how it affected me. It doesn\u2019t actually name my abuser or anyone else involved\u2013 all names are changed.\nMy problem is that my abuser knows all of my social media, lurks on them, etc. I have wanted to post this testimony of mine to a couple of my accounts but if they find it, I am scared of what will happen to me. I know them to have made up lies about me before to isolate me (I know this because I am now close friends with one of those people). They collect friends with much more social influence than themself to have more power over people\u2019s opinions. I am afraid they will use those people against me and ruin my online life, basically the only life I have worth something. \nIf anyone is wondering why I want to post this testimony in the first place, I believe it is essential for me to be able to say it was abuse to myself and others. I want it to reach people who may have been lied to by my abuser about the person I am. It may be naive to hope that the truth will change my abuser\u2019s behavior towards people in the future, but I also hope for that.\n\nTLDR; I want to speak up about the abuse, but I don\u2019t want to have my public image ripped to shreds by abuser.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I even posted my suicide attempt. I look back and think how crazy it all was. I\u2019m more emotionally stable now (kinda). \n\nIs 8 months a long time? It doesn\u2019t feel like it. Everyday actually goes by really fast. It\u2019s strange, I don\u2019t miss him, I don\u2019t want to be with him. I don\u2019t like him and I don\u2019t think I love him. I say I don\u2019t love him, but I do grieve still. I know who he really is, what he really is. And that the person I fell in love with wasn\u2019t real and that he even brainwashed me into loving him. He would tell me how much I loved him, he would tell me how he was the love of my life, in the same ways he\u2019d tell me he was the best looking person in the world and that everybody likes him. \n\nI still struggle to comprehend that it was actually a reality for me. That it all really happened and someone can be that sadistic and psychopathic. Don\u2019t we all though? It\u2019s also frustrating now and then knowing that people out there have never actually met the real him, but think they know him. And how I\u2019m sure he has told them all stories that I\u2019m the psycho and people probably wouldn\u2019t really believe me if I told them the truth because the truth is that ugly. It doesn\u2019t bother me that much though, but it still feels like an injustice and one that I know I will never get justice for. And that\u2019s an ongoing feeling and reminder that the world isn\u2019t fair. \n\nHe robbed me of my innocence. The world doesn\u2019t look or feel the same anymore. I will forever perceive the world in a different light. It\u2019s one of those \u201conce you see it you can\u2019t un-see it\u201d things. I have anger and hate towards him for that. \n\nI have suffered with night terrors and waking up in panic attacks. I don\u2019t really go outside much (but hey I just got myself a new job and a volunteer role too) and my anxiety has heightened so much that I take pills daily even though I swore to myself I never would take pills for my mental health. I\u2019m not as empathetic towards people as I use to be. I\u2019m actually more apathetic overall in life. I get irritated easily and quite honestly, I would be happy left alone for the rest of my life and I\u2019m only 22. I can\u2019t stand being around people for very long. \n\nI sometimes obsess over the fact that we can never ever truly know someone. I see human beings differently now. As complex and unique yet, the same and predictable. Almost like robots, some have ok programming some have faulty. I can\u2019t maintain connections well anymore nor do I really care to. I don\u2019t trust people\u2019s displays of emotions. I understand I\u2019m depressed, but at the same time I just see it as having a different understanding of the world now. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll adapt eventually. \n\nI\u2019m with a different guy now. Too soon? Probably. He\u2019s really nice to me, he respects my boundaries, he listens to me, he prioritises me. He doesn\u2019t force anything. No shouting screaming name calling - nothing. No silent treatments or violence. Has a job, a car, doesn\u2019t ask for money, takes me out, is saving for a house, has ambition and morals and values. We have similar personalities both the same star sign like the same things. I feel comfortable around him. But I still worry he might turn around and kill me one day. And on most days feel I just want to be left alone. He understands this and tells me I just need to get better. But better might be without him. I guess what I\u2019m saying is they do exist - the nice guys, but doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019ll fall head over heels when you meet one. Or maybe I\u2019m just being lovebombed again although I\u2019m so apathetic I don\u2019t really see what the point would be. Surely a Narc would get bored, because I don\u2019t react anymore, I don\u2019t care for defending myself getting my own back teaching lessons or proving a point. I just silently disappear. As I have with several friends. \n\nI know I need to give myself more time to heal. But honestly, I really don\u2019t see how you ever truly look passed what happened when it comes to abuse. It\u2019s always in the back of your mind. \n \nOn the other hand though, I\u2019m truly grateful I had this sub to vent on. I\u2019m glad it led me to discover what he really is. I had no previous knowledge of NPD before googling his behaviour and a post on reddit came up describing narcissists. \n\nHowever, I do find comfort and happiness is small things. He use to control my eating, my money, clothes I wore, how I had my hair, what and when I drank, when I went out, who I saw, EVERYTHING. So now I remind myself of what it feels like to get my control back and I find some hope in that. \n\n\nI\u2019m grateful that I slowly have my identity back. I can be friends with who I like. I can answer my phone when I like or even turn it off if I want to. I don\u2019t have to explain myself to anyone. I can go to sleep and wake up when I like and oh my do I love having as much space in the bed as i like (he use to allocate me the tiniest slot). I can eat what I like. I wear what I like. I\u2019m not in any debt. I have my hair however I like. Some days I don\u2019t even get dressed and no one can call me selfish and lazy and a waste of space. I value my time and my independence and that freedom back. \n\nBut there are still some chains left. It took a while to ignore the voice of him in my head, telling me I was worthless or that what I was wearing looked stupid or I shouldn\u2019t eat that I don\u2019t deserve to eat or that people don\u2019t want to be around me I don\u2019t matter. I still struggle with it. \n\nBut we just have to keep pushing on. Keep wading through the heavy waters. I think that\u2019s the most inspiring thing about all of us. Even if we fall into a hole and get depressed, or we change for the worse or we struggle daily - we still keep pushing on. We still show up each day. I think that\u2019s what counts, just showing up...not for anyone else, but for yourself. So just keep showing up, you don\u2019t have to give 100% but just show up.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

At this point, I am completely done and asking him for a divorce. His response has been to cry, say he has no where else to go, and tell me I am a bad person. It's obvious he won't let me leave, and even though he hasn't been physical with me, I don't feel safe in my apartment anymore. \n\nI finally broke down and called my mom and told her everything that has happened and said I that I think I need to help moving out. Her response was that my father did worse things to her when they were first married, I need to support my husband because he is obviously going through something, and I'm probably doing just as horrible things to him as he is to me. \n\nHe always told me no one would believe me, but every time he threatened me, told me to kill myself, etc, I always held out that it wasn't bad enough, told myself once it was I could tell someone what was going on and get help. Now I honestly don't know what to do.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

His mother is also a narcissist who abused all her children.\n\nThings that had previously hurt me really came back and stood out to me.\nThe time I paid for us to have a full day out together. Drove us everywhere and paid for everything... then on the way home he told me I wasn't as sexy as some of his exes and he wasn't going to call me sexy because he didn't want my head to get too big.\n\nThe time I was trying to explain to him why I was upset about something and he screamed in my face \"boo fucking hoo!\"\nI slapped his arm to make him stop screaming at me and then he started claiming I was abusive and he didnt want to be with someone who was abusive.\nThen he went home and told everyone I'd ditched him in the middle of nowhere.\n\nHe contacts me every 2 weeks or so.

(TBH I don't blame her since these jobs would mean them working together).\nI didn't respond. \n\nHe continued ranting about how he doesn't care that she's blocked him on everything or that she gets upset when he shows up at her exhibitions. He's upset because she's so good at everything and if someone like her goes out of her way to block him out of her life, what does that make him!?\n\nHe just has no respect for boundaries. He doesn't care that he's upsetting her (or me!)

No pressure to respond\" which I took to mean there would be more messages. So I DID respond.\nI said \"I understand.

So we made small talk and I thought my time to escape had come... then he asked if he could tag along until I left!! (\"You can tell me to fuck off if you want to\"... as if I have the capacity to be rude to anyone).\n\nHe just brings this cloud of negativity, and whatever the conversation, whatever he says, there s always SOMETHING whether it's subtle or whether it's obvious there's always SOMETHING to make me feel less than.

I want to move", "author": "vikingmaiden3", "self_text": "Background. Met in 2006  when I was 17 he was 27. Stayed together until last April. He started choking me a year in. I've had guns held to my head. Threats he'd kill me. Etc. I have always been financially independent of him. Have a good career. Shitty neglectful and abusive parents which is why I didn't really wake up until last year after they both died. I was extremely isolated and never had spent even one Saturday in 12 years alone and had almost no friends. \n\nI tried leaving several times before and always went back. But finally I ended it for good last April. He spent months being crazy, insisting on keeping cameras in my house (we'd had them for years and I never had access), showing up randomly, threatening me and other people I was seeing or made friends with, actually tried to kill me twice, stalked me, used lawyers to intimidate me, camped himself in my house in December up until mid January (literally would only leave to go to work and I was too afraid for a long time to force it) when I again stood up firmly. \n\nHe's been arrested, gone to jail, is on probation, divorce is final for many months, I've tried no contact, been in counseling weekly, I had a restraining order at one point. \n\nMy therapist specializes in this stuff. I've worked with her for 6 years and she's helped me through everything. I have full faith in her.\n\nAnyway he knows how to manipulate me and get to me. Extremely well. He studied psychology purposefully to learn how to manipulate people. He's an extremely intelligent man. He's a senior security expert and could track me down to the ends of the earth if he wanted. The kind of guy the mob or whatever would hire to find people. He's an insanely talented hacker. Very charismatic and has turned many people against me. \n\nWhen he got arrested that's when he got very dangerous. I have called the police 6 times. 1x he managed to almost get me committed to a mental hospital and arrested for hurting him (I'm 5'3 and he's 6'2) despite me having bruises from being choked (he can manipulate almost anything) . 4x they never even showed up. 1x they did and he was arrested because he was too drunk to talk his way out of it.\n\nThe police here are useless. The restraining order got fought and reneged. He told me if I ever call them again he will hunt me down forever. He's not above paying people to do his dirty work either. \n\nHe uses psychological manipulation on me. I can't block him entirely because then I have less warning when he shows up and gets crazy. He's started dating a 21 year old (he's 40) and drives by my neighborhood 2x a day, eats at the places near me, shops at my grocery store with her despite him living downtown, which I have to avoid entirely. He never says any of this in text and records me and can manipulate things to make it look like he did nothing wrong. \n\nHe knows how to hook me in and get a response. Most my family is dead so I'm pretty alone here and he plays on that. He chases away anyone I get close to, used whoever he is dating to mess with my head, and uses my loneliness against me. I also got hit by a semi truck yeara ago and have injuries that require me to need physical help picking up anything over 20lbs, he also manipulates that. \n\nI'm at the point I have no choice but to move. The couple close friends I have who have witnessed everything and know what I'm dealing with, they still tell me to just call the police everytime and I get blamed for some of what he does because I won't call them anymore. I had one person with me once when I called and they literally told me they were too busy to come since my ex had fled the premises already. That person is the only one who believes me the police aren't reliable. \n\nI can't call the police. My psychologist agrees its the most dangerous thing I could do. She's been suggesting moving since day 1 but I own a house here and have fought against it for a year. \n\nBut he came over yesterday and convinced me to let him in somehow and tried to force himself on me. He then left and blamed me. I'm completely traumatized. I don't feel safe at home. I don't feel safe nearby me where he takes his gf, I don't feel safe downtown or pretty much any bar in town (he's an alcoholic and literally bounces around places to make me afraid of going absolutely anywhere). I have massive PTSD and have gotten fmla from work twice. I'm bipolar too and this is causing me major episodes and my life is falling apart. \n\nI desperately want to move. I'm an engineer and I need to be in good mental shape to interview for what I do, it's math based and hard as heck so it'll probably take a couple months. But people tell me in running away and letting him run my life and I just need to call the police or find a way to be do this or do that. They tell me moving is bull crap and get mad at me. \n\nI feel really alone and like it is my fault. I do take accountability for talking to him or letting him near me. Sometimes it's to placate him and stay safe, other times he manipulates me and later I am so confused what the eff happened. But I have made mistakes. I can own that. But he is dangerous, he is smart, and I'm terrified of him and don't want to ever involve the police again. I'm losing any support network I have because of it though. I'm starting the resume process tomorrow and am committed to moving. \n\nI guess I just needed to get this out. Hear from anyone whoever went through anything similar. \n\nWhat are some good resources? \n\nIs moving really that crazy? I feel like I'll end up dead from him, my own mental health, or from having panic attacks and driving or something and I end up in an accident. If I stay I'm certain it'll be the end of me somehow. It's a year later and things are not getting better. \n", "subreddit": "abuse"}

It fills me with such rage.\nHow do I deal with this? I feel so unresolved.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

That he is noticing all the signs I had told him about and that now he feels like he is being targeted and thrown under the bus. He says he wants to end the friendship with the guy and leave the narc leads. \nIt might be my ego, but does discarding a narc cause them to have their mask slip? It seems like it has been slipping really bad lately, so much that my friend noticed everything I said was true now. Or was it because I stopped trying to convince him? \nWhat do you all think?

Please note that human memory is crap, i will do my best to write things accurately as i can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my mother had 2 daughters from her first marriage who are significantly older then me. Her husband left her, turns out he was transgender and went through the surgery etc. She would keep full custody of them. My mother would then marry my biological dad. They are devoutly religious Christians. They would end up being classified as charismatic Christians for those of you know know the nuances of the different denominations. Both me and my half sisters were homeschooled and we lived pretty far out in the country. Nearest house was a 1/4 mile away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst time some one tried to kill me. It was Christmas eve and we were spending it with the extended family. My aunt and uncle had moved back from Honduras and were the hosts of the party in their house which was a large old barn that had been converted into a house and an art studio. As small children are often do i got bored and began to wander around. My aunt ended up finding me i am guessing someplace i was not supposed to be, believing i was trying to steal her art (keep in mind i am around 5) she proceeds to attack me, ultimately with a chefs knife. I am fast thankfully, and managed to evade her until her husband her the ruckus and stopped her. (a little back history that i now know, the reason why they left Honduras was because their neighbor was literately shot to pieces and they found the body. The cops refused to do anything and they fled the country. You combine that with paranoid schizophrenia you have a big problem, skip ahead a couple of decades i had to call the cops this past summer because she was threatening the neighbors kids with a knife and no one was believing the kids, accept for me because i asked about the details and it sounded like what had happened to me) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut i digress. This was the first time. 16 more times to go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother got pregnant again, needless to say i was incredibly excited. I knew all to well that my 2 half sisters only kind of viewed me as family since they had each other...... I could show you the exact place i was standing when i got the news. I was at a friends house while my mother was in the hospital giving birth. My friends mom came out of the garage and proceeded to tell me that my sister had died during child birth, to which my friend started laughing and saying ha ha your sister is dead. Looking back now i realize there was no malicious intent, just a small child having an inappropriate response to distress. However me at that age did not comprehend that. It ended up turning out she strangled in her umbilical cord during birth. Just bad fucking luck. I still remember holding her body at the hospital that night.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNeedless to say this was when everything really started to go to shit. My biological dad is borderline autistic, so handling emotion is not exactly his forte. My mother has borderline personality disorder. Oh and the church we were going to kicked us out because they said we were cursed by God and that's why my sister died. Things got real bad after that. My biological father became more and more violent. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo complicate things further i was having an incredibly difficult time with school. I was home schooled and was missing all the benchmarks. Finally when i was 8 i ended up getting sent to be evaluated.  I found the records a few months ago when i was going through some old papers. What they ended up diagnosing me with was dyslexia, auditory processing disability, ADD, and ADHD. They crazy part was i placed in the bottom 1% for language comprehension.... well bellow where i would be considered retarded, and then on the mathematics and spacial cognition.... top 1%.  Talk about a dichotomy. Needless to say i have a very very odd brain that does not process things like most people. Thankfully i did get a specialized tutor for a year. At 9.5 i finally started to be able to read. Lagging behind my pears caused allot of social issues though, especially because i was home schooled and my only real social interaction with other kids was a history co-op for the home schooled kids through out church.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings came to another climax when i was 9. It was the middle of the summer and he was planting some trees in the yard. It was excruciatingly hot and i was protesting being forced to be out in the middle of a field in the heat. Now something to keep in mind is that i was a fairly sickly kid. I had gotten pneumonia quite a few times. Also now i know that i also get rheumatic fever, also for some odd reason my body didn't start sweating until my early 20s so i was prone to heat exhaust and stroke. He ended up getting pissed and proceeded to try to hit me over the head with a shovel. Again i am fast an agile, and really really fucking lucky. I managed to dodge a couple of times and was able to get away because i was able to slip through the electric fence and he was to large to fit between the wires so he couldn't keep on chasing me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLooking back at this time period its just fucking insane, i remember hiding inside my dresser so he wouldn't find me. Imagine that for a second, taking your stuffed animal and hiding inside your dresser for hours so you father couldn't find you. Or the nicer option climbing high up in trees. I was a very small child so i could climb incredibly high into the canopy to the point were i was nick named george of the jungle. It was the only place i felt safe and at peace, swaying back and forth way up high away from where any adult could get to me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of my odd traits is how truthful i am. When i was a kid i was literally incapable of lying. And when you have psychotic parents not being able to lie is a big fucking problem. If memory serves me right that same summer as the shovel incident the extended family on my moms side rented a house for a family reunion. A bunch of my cousins and my uncle ended up going to a local amusement park where he ended up buying me a cap gun rifle. When we got back to the house i was excited to show my dad. Finesse is not something he posses. While looking at he started to admire how well it was made and started to flex in to show how well it was made until something inside snapped very loudly. Me being a kid i immediately told him he broke it and to stop. Now keep this in mind that this is in front of the entire family. Everyone heard it break. He starts to demand that i say that he didn't break it. At this age i was still incapable of lying and couldn't. He proceeded to beat me so badly i couldn't sit without being in pain for weeks. My family. They. Did. Nothing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy half sisters moved out the house very shortly after this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings started to get worse and worse. Finally at 11 i convinced my mother to run away. I knew it was just a matter of time until we ended up dead. Again its one of those things looking back i am just like WHAT THE FUCK, WHY AT 11 WAS I THE ONE PACKING THE HOUSE UP, I LITERALLY MOVED US WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DRIVING THE GOD DAMN VAN. Now up until this point i wouldn't say i had a good or bad relationship with my mother. The only relationship i had with her was that of someone who also had survived the same abuser. Well shit was about to get real, because surprise surprise. Shit wasn't quite that simple. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRight after we moved out she ended up taking a month long trip to Europe. Yep you heard that right i said SHE, not WE. I was left to handle things on my own. For a month i had to convince friends parents to let me stay with them, to feed me, to drive me to another friends house when i had overstayed my welcome. I WAS FUCKING 11. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen she came back she moved us in with my grandparents for the winter. Please cue complete failure by mental health professionals episode 1. I got court mandated therapy. Not many people i still hate, but fuck that guy.  I remember him giving me a story he wanted me to write the ending to. It was about a knight who went of to war for many years and when he finally returned he kept on wearing his armor, but now he wasn't at war anymore and it was starting to rust and restrict his movements. Needles to say he was trying to get me to be vulnerable with the people around me because he believed i was safe now. Dumb fucking idiot. While i might have not known it on an intellectual level, some where i apparently knew that that was not the case. That brings use to attempts 3, 4, 5, .......\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou know those memories you look back on when you get older and your jaw just hits the floor and your like holy fuck that was not normal. For me normal was always paying attention to my mother driving, making sure she didn't fall asleep at the wheel and you know..... like drive off a bridge. Except it was only ever bridges.... I know of at least 3 times where she tried to commit murder suicide by driving us off a bridge. I grabbed the wheel and kept us on the road. Imagine having that responsibility at 11. Turns out my mother blamed my dad for my sister dying, and once he was out of the picture, guess who she blamed? His son!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat following school year she would move us to Baltimore, because you know like, who doesn't dream of moving to the 2nd deadliest city (at the time it was). Soooo super religious kid who has been home schooled his whole life, gets dropped into public schools in Baltimore for 8th grade. Brilliant right????? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah that didn't go very well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh but being in public school i did get to find out i was blind without glasses. I remember my teacher being like you cant see the chalk board and me being dumbfounded other kids could. Jeaz expecting parents to do there job, come on why would you expect that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough every once in a while my poor excuse of a mother would do something right half of purpose half on accident. Cue my adopted dad. For clarity his is not legally my adopted dad nor was he ever with my mother. So the gist of how this started was my mother was working in food and bev and she commented on something my adopted dad was wearing and he mentioned he had his own engineering and manufacturing company and she told him about me and how i loved building things. He told her to bring me by sometime, he had had a couple of apprentices before me but they all dropped out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAgain one of those moments looking back where you go WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU THINKING but this one worked out for me. So my adopted dad has a separate building on his property where he build most of the prototypes for his company. My mother brought me over and i spent to the day with him. Looking back at it what were you thinking leaving a 12 year old with a man you have only met once with no other supervision and no knowledge that he was safe. Luckily he would be my safety line. Needless to say we bonded like well father and son.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was the only time my mother dropped me off at his house. She had better things to do like date abusive men. So my adopted dad would come a pick me up for the day on allot of weekends. Without him there is no question i would be dead. For a long time i would just call him my uncle but eventually that would change. He was the one who helped me by starting me to questions my religious beliefs, how to drive a car, how to not get a girl pregnant, how to cook, how to sew, i will never be able to thank him enough. There were so many warning signs back then, looking back i can't help but say how the fuck did no one actually do anything. The only one who did was my adopted dad but the actually professionals didn't do God damn shit. I remember a friends parent getting mad at me because i had to leave before i was able to eat dinner with them and asked for a plate to go of food. Like WHAT THE FUCK IF A KID MAKES A BIG DEAL OUT OF GETTING FOOD TO GO ITS PROBABLY BECAUSE THERE ISN'T FOOD AT HOME YOU IDIOT. But no i was the selfish child who was just using them, yeah using them to not die.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose 3 years in Baltimore were a crazy combination of hell and little moments with my adopted dad that kept me going. My mother would become more and more abusive. The whiplash was the worst, one moment i would be the best son any mother could wish for, the next moment she would be screaming at me how i was just like my father, about how lazy i was, about how terrible i was, about how the Christmas tree falling over and breaking ornaments was my fault (i had warned it would too, idiot) Things were bad, there would be several more attempts on my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then comes my step dad. Imagine all the worst stereotypes of step dads, yeah that's probably him. I remember him after meeting my cousin back at my house saying house disrespectful he was, keep in my mind my cousin was 7 years younger then me. He started talking about how he should have hit him and that if he talked to him that way again he would. Keep in mind that this is a 50 year old man talking about a little kid. Needless to say i told him to shut the fuck up and if he said another word i would kill him...... so like the religious nut job my mother was she proceeded to try to cast the devil out of me. Apparently laughing is the wrong reaction to have when someone tries to cast the devil out of you...... ooops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo then they get engaged.... literally the worst boyfriend out of a dozen, yep that one, marry that one. But we won't move, she  promises, keep in mind at this point i have gone to a different school every single years since 8th grade. And i have my adopted dad here in Baltimore.  Yeah that was bullshit. Off to Denver we go.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDenver was complicated, though i guess that has been my entire life so why should that surprise me now. For the first time i went to a decent school,  WE HAD A/C! OH and books that weren't falling apart, oh and no one was burning the trash cans in the bathroom, oh and no one tried to kill me on the way home from school, plus!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was hear that i started to shine in academics, who knew having some decent support at school makes a big differences. I would end up as the copy editor of my high school newspaper, in almost all A.P. classes, going to University of Colorado part time during my senior year, part of the sci tech team as a junior which was exclusive to seniors (and i beat them on most of the projects too) and i earned my self a full ride scholarship!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was almost out of hell, i only had a few months left and then i would be free!  Now a little bit of past context, since we left my father he would send me letters, lots of them. No response from me but he would for years. At around 15 i started talking to him again. He had gotten medicated, he had found a therapist, he was consistent about seeing her. We started to build a friendship. Christmas rolls around senior year and i fly back to the east coast to spend it with family. When i get back to Denver my mother and step father confront me about how they \"accidentally\" found my journal while cleaning my room. (it was clean and they didn't clean anything, just being themselves)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately i had written the truth. Which is to say i had written how tragic it was that my mother had married another abusive asshole. (also for perspective my step dad has a daughter who he lost all custody rights to her mother when she ran away, also his older brother as well as a few other family members confronted him about how he treated me) They confronted me about what i had written, and well there is not much to say in this situation. My step dad got more and more agitated and finally he starts poking me in the chest while yelling, keep in mind he is standing up and i am sitting in a chair. Finally i ball my fists up still sitting and tell him to back off and he keeps on screaming. Keep in mind at this point i finally went through my growth spurt, i went from 5'6\" to 6' in a year and a half. My step dad was around 5'6\". I knew how it would look if i got in a fight with him. Step son beats up short step dad. Yeah, i would get blamed. So i start to call the cops, i just have a few months left, i just need to be left alone. He slaps the phone out of my hand so i walk out of the house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had some good friends who lived near by. I went to school with their daughter and the father was a pastor and we spent many a night talking philosophical discussions. When i got there i ask my friends dad to use the phone to call the cops, he told me that my mom had called and had told him to not let me use the phone. (Again looking back WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU GOD DAMN IDIOTS) so i bail because there is no help there. I walk a mile to my schools librarians house who i was friends with as well as her kids (same age as me) when i show up they were just sitting down for dinner. I tell them what happened and they convince me to sit down with them for dinner and calm down and that they will help me sort it out afterwards. Looking back this was the wrong decision but they were genuinely trying to do what was best for me and cared far more than almost anyone else in my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have dinner with them and right at the end of it there is a knock at the door. Turns out my mother and step father had called the cops and told them that i had run away from home. My friends family make a big fuss while talking to the cops about everything but in the end the cops take me back to my house. My friends dad who was a pastor had come over while i was gone or right after i got back with the cops. He promised to act as a mediator so the police left. We ended up agreeing that i should move back in with my biological dad. Everyone goes to bed, i wake up sunday morning and no one is in the house except for me, needless to say i am worried about my mother because of my step fathers history of violence. I go to school monday and meet with my school counselor and tell her everything that had happened. She tells me that for the police to do anything the person has to be missing for atleast 48 hours so if at the end of tomorrow i haven't heard from her the next morning my counselor would help me deal with the police.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday goes by and nothing, wake up tuesday and still nothing. I come home from school and no one is home, so i go to my librarians house and have dinner with them. When i go home there is several dozen cops there at my house. Needless to say i am a little freaked out, but also i am used to having family members and strangers try to kill me.....  cops immediately bring me into the living room and proceed to interrogated me for SEVEN FUCKING HOURS. From 6 p.m. until 1 a.m. Now at this point in my life i still believed in the police, i believed in our justice system, i believed that people cared about the truth.  I would be arrested that night and taken to a high security prison. No charges filed, didn't even read me my rights....... but the arresting officer did cuss me out. Told me if his daughter ever balled her fist at him he would have taken her to the floor (i just remembering thing what the fuck is wrong with this guy)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the next couple of weeks i would end up finding out a couple crucial pieces of information. First my step dad had been walked off the jobsite for yelling at a customer, 2nd they were living off my child support, and 3rdly they had been pocketing several hundred dollars a month my dad was giving them to buy me health insurance. If i moved back in with my biological dad they would loose my child support, loose the money they had been stealing for my health insurance, and my dad would find out about it. So instead they went to the cops and told them that i was building a bomb and planing on blowing up my high school. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn every meaning of the word that matters they sold me.  Like what person with a full ride scholarship, freedom ahead of them, would do shit like that. NO ONE! I worked my god damn ass off to get out of there. What do i get. HEY WELCOME TO PRISON. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCue someone trying to kill me again. Yay prison.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe most fucked shit about all of this is the people who were supposed to be on my side or their for me were utterly worthless. Guardian ad litem, worthless. Public defender, worthless. Pre trial release officer who was supposed to keep me on the straight and narrow and nail me if i screwed up? Nope he became my biggest advocate..... right behind the judge. Ended up finding out that it was election year and the d.a. thought i would be her golden ticket for re election. The terrorist she caught! (oh and may i point out she went under numerous ethic investigations, though of course nothing happened, what a shocker)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would plead guilty a year later for...... wait for it.... possession of fireworks..... which my mother had purchased when we lived in P.A. and i might add they never left the property but you know a public defender.... actually defending..... good fucking luck on that one. Mandatory 2 years of probation but my judge was the shit and counted since the day i was arrested as time already served and that knocked it down to one year. You should have seen the D.A. you would have thought she had an aneurysm. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was during this time that my PTSD would finally come home. Honesty its a fucking miracle i made it that long without it. When you have it, it changes you to the very essence of your being. I can't say for sure, but when you meet someone else who has it. You know almost instantly. Its all the little cues that tell you. When you experience flash backs.... just fuck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple of months after the trial ended i said i am out and moved back to the east coast. That following spring (still 18) i would meet my ex wife. Unfortunately we are often attracted to those who are like our parents. In this case my ex has BPD. She is probably one of the if not the most brilliant women i have ever met. When she was stable she was incredible. I guess this goes along with not being able to lie (thank God i picked up the skill finally around 16 or 17 but that core is still me) when i married her i meant for better or worse. Problem was when she was not stable. It was bad, very very very bad. I remember her screaming at me for asking to talk to her (and i mean like talk about whats for dinner, or just hey lets talk about that trip or etc. According to her that was me being abusive. I remember the night she took a knife to her own throat. I have never have been more terrified in my life. I remember trying to calm her down, of slowly trying to de-escalate the situation.  Of finally being close enough to take the knife from her, and of her then trying to stab me with it. Thankfully no one got seriously hurt and i was able to get her into a amazing hospital. She would end up spending a month in there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn getting out i was desperate to do anything that would help her. I knew that sunshine helped her allot. That she seemed to be much more stable with sunny weather so we ended up moving to Colorado. Now keep in mind this entire time i am working and putting her through college.  Now anyone who is familiar with someone with BPD knows just how terrible an illness it is. I can tell you how many times she told me she wanted a divorce to only have her turn around and tell me how much she loved me and was so excited to see where life went with me. Everything kept on taking a toll on me until i dropped down to 117 lbs at 6'. And then life intervened.  I was out walking at the lake with my friend and his dog when we heard screaming. We looked down the hill and saw that a little girl, 6 or 7 had been playing out on the ice in the middle of the lake with her sister and had fallen through the ice. My buddy had just broken both his wrists so there was nothing he could do. So i proceeded to try to slide out on the ice on my stomach to the kid. I made it maybe 10 ft before i went through the ice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still have the scars on my arms, there was a kid, there was ice in the way, fuck. that. god. damn. ice. Using my forearms i broke the ice in front of  me for a couple of hundred ft until i got to her and brought her back. Those last 30ft i was dying. I remember being so scared that i wasn't going to be able to get her out of there. I switch from pulling her behind me to pushing her in front of me so if i went under i wouldn't be in the way and she would have a better chance. Somehow i managed to endure. Honestly i couldn't tell you what she looked like, only that her hair was black and that her family was from the middle east. I will never forget the sounds of her father saying thank you, of her mother crying and holding her daughter. And me being the usual me i told them to get her out of the wet clothes and dry and warm and i bailed. Because well hypothermia is a bitch. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat little girl saved my life every bit as much as i saved hers. Up until then i took the abuse, i didn't think i deserved it, but also i didn't think i deserved better. Needless to say things ended with the ex wife. I will continue once i have the emotional energy to finish the story.  If you made it here, thank you. Life has been getting me down lately and i need to get all of this out and off my chest.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I spent 1.5 months building up the strength to cut contact, so I don't feel the urge to talk to him. I'm really proud of myself for doing this and I know it's for the best. But without my connection with him, I realized how few friends actually care about me deeply. I have shared my issues with narcissist abuse at some level with at least 10 friends and voiced how difficult the situation is for me. After cutting contact, I even told friends how much I'm struggling and no one has checked in with me without me texting them first. I always try to keep track of what's going on in my friends lives and ask them about it, but I don't get the same in return. Perhaps I haven't been the greatest friend given how much time/effot my Nex required of me. Or maybe I just perceive that my friends don't care, I'm not sure. I spent my birthday alone last week and it just makes me so sad. My parents support me, but they can't be there for me like a friend.\n\nAt least I'm seeing a therapist, and she said that it's difficult to recover without a strong support group. She encouraged me to explain to my friends further that I need more help, but I hate the idea of asking them to support me more; it feels disingenuous. I'm also about to graduate college and very few friends will continue to live in my city. Is there any way I can enhance my relationship with my friends? Or should I focus on self-soothing methods?

He had been incredibly inactive in building the business, ignored arguments to participate, would always tell me I was a crazy bitch when we would get in an inevitable argument about how he was a bad investment due to his negligence. It\u2019s coming up on the first anniversary of my father\u2019s passing which coincides with when my business partner flipped out on me about how it wasn\u2019t his fault my father was going on hospice because it was such an inconvenience to him and told me to get over it. My partner then continued to ignore the business for an entire month while I spent time with my family as a priority, spending one day a week in the office trying to catch everything up. The reason he started to pick up more work is because a mutual friend told him to pull his head out of his ass but he then publicly had to blame me for never teaching him any of the things I\u2019d spent 3 years trying to get him active in. Then when my father passed, my partner made a big deal about showing up at the funeral. Thankfully he did not. \n\nI have drawn up huge boundaries and the business is for sale. Unfortunately he is still a narcissist and now I freak out incredibly easily. I do not like holding onto the hate and disgust I have for this person that is still in my life but it\u2019s there. I have a huge amount of resentment for someone who obviously has a personality disorder. Hopefully the business sells someday soon but how do I find my sanity in the meantime? \n\nCurrently I have him blocked from any communication with me because he tried to pick a fight in front of the staff about how selfish I was which is generally the start of a cycle where he drunkenly texts me abusive things or pulls some public social media stunt to make me look stupid and unwilling to work at the business.

He did horrible things and then started placing blame on me, trying to change history, so it suddenly seemed like he was the victim. He told friends and our young children terrible lies about me. He was intimidating and threatening and lying and gaslighting until I finally left.\n\nSince that time, I've realized how emotionally  abusive he really was all those years. We were together for 18 years, since I was still in high school. He was explosive when I asked things of him that he didn't agree with, he didn't encourage me with things I wanted to do because everything was about him. When I was upset, he would get angry at me, either turning the subject back to him (\"What about me? I have a stressful job!\") or intimidating me to stay quiet (\"What do you want me to do about it? Quit my job so I can do everything for you?\").\n\nWell now, it's just starting to click... Are my parents abusive, too? I mean I know we had conflicts. We are overall pretty close, but I've always felt that they will not accept me making decisions for myself. They argue and argue, make little negative comments or just roll their eyes or huff when I talk about something they disagree with. Then, when I started having issues with my husband, they seemed to belittle my concerns. They said things like \"oh he would never actually hurt you. He's probably just mad about the divorce. He wouldn't do that. Maybe it was a mistake.\" I feel like I have to argue every single thing I ever decide. \n\nNow I'm in a poly relationship and my parents spent months arguing how it just doesn't make sense, they don't understand, it's counter to how they grew up, they disagree and I will never change their minds. Mind you, I'm not making them change their relationship or even love the idea, I just want then to accept the relationship and allow me to talk about it without negative comments. They refused to meet or talk to him despite the fact that he had been my #1 supporter through every painful thing I've been going through, he has done so much for me and my family, and my kids love him. Finally after we had been together almost a year, they met him and they are using that as a \"see? We aren't putting down your choices! We met him! We just don't agree and won't support it.\". For reference, my dad has an acquaintance who is literally a child rapist. But he says he has moral standards so he refused to meet my bf for several months.\n\nAs a kid, my mom criticized so much about me. She constantly told me \"it's what's on the inside that matters\", but also made fun of the way I ate and said I would never get a boyfriend like that. She criticized my hair choices, she wanted me to dress in a more provocative manner and wear more make up in high school. She was upset that I was a theatre and dance nerd, and I wasn't dating so she regularly told me to ask people out our join the youth group. No wonder I developed an eating disorder and married the first guy who paid attention to me.  She also totally ignored me when I was dealing with some severe bullying that gave me horrible anxiety.\n\nWhen I became a parent, I had to hear her criticisms about what I feed my kids, how long I breastfed, my choice in their education (she's a teacher so she thought she should have a say), what friends they have, activities I bring them to... Again, I feel like it's an ongoing battle that keeps bubbling back up and I have to spend hours defending myself while they say the same things over and over. My parents also bribe my agnostic children to go to church with them. I am not opposed, but it had started making my kids unconfortable when my parents say \"well your SISTER is going with us, you should too! We aren't going to take you out anywhere fun if you don't go with us then.\"\n\nMy dad was just explosively angry. He would act really nice when other people were around, and then blow up and yell at me after. He would lecture me on and on and on and it wouldn't stop. He also was very inappropriate with his humor and comments made in front of me at a young age. Not so much ABOUT me, except when he told me I should work at hooters. I was 16 and an incredibly innocent 16 year old.\n\nSo now, I've had this blow up with my parents. I'm stressed as a single mom and they keep telling me suggestions that I don't want to do. I tell them that I really don't want their suggestions, but I keep getting irritating (unrealistic) suggestions. I also keep getting told not to let things bother me. So I finally let everything out, told them all of this. They responded by getting mad that I was upset at first, deflecting to all the things they've done for me, saying they DO support me, they just don't always agree but they ask questions so they can understand, they love me lots, they are sorry I'm upset, and they want to be supportive! Also that they felt they has to be defensive because I was saying so many critical things about them. I had to explain, I'm defending my life choices. They are defending their ability to criticize my life choices. Not equivalent.\n\nIt feels like I'm being gaslighted here. You don't refuse to meet someone who is very important to your child and roll your eyes at the mention of his name, only because you are just being supportive and trying to understand, you just disagree. Nope. You don't minimize every abusive thing that your child has experienced, add of its just her perception. You don't spend a decade arguing about educational choices because they are different from your own. You don't tell a person they are overreacting over and over and over.\n\nThis is a lot to take ask at once and I'm not sure how to deal with it. I don't think I'll be able to talk to them for a while. Discussing goes nowhere. My dad ends up changing the subject and acting like I should go back to being happy go lucky and ignoring issues. My mom tells me how supportive and loving she really is. Ack\n\nThoughts or ideas (support only please) appreciated. ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

She met him right around the time I turned four years old and after she divorced my dad, and which I didn\u2019t see him again after. \n\nThis man is loud, arrogant, rude, dominating, convincing and much more. He brainwashed my mom and hid most of the abuse he did to me and my sister from her. She had no idea that he would literally terrorize us while she was at work, and that he was sexually abusing me. \n\nI grew up watching my mom get beat physically, and I have suspicions she may have been sexually assaulted by him but it\u2019s never been confirmed. My mom would also defend my younger sister with her life, even when my sister did do something wrong and he was trying to spank her. I very often fell like I was being fed to a wolf because she never defended me.\n\nHe would do a lot of abusive things that went past just physical abuse. To the point where if I mention the details I don\u2019t think I ever had it that bad and I\u2019m being dramatic. This is probably due to them always telling me not to feel sorry for myself, invalidating me, and chanting my name while saying,\u201dPoor you, you\u2019re such a victim.\u201d \n\nMy school started becoming suspicious when I would show up crying and covered in bruises, but since scare tactics were also used, I refused to tell them anything or very much at all about what was happening. \n\nA social worker was investigating and she would meet with me at school in a private room and it took me a little while to start telling her more. Eventually, I did but nothing ever happened until my sister said something about him too and they finally believed me I guess? Because they then took us to fostercare and we got sent back to them soon after.\n\nWhile I was in the fosterhome he had apparently done a lie detector test, the story changes from me being told he did one to more than one so I\u2019m not sure, but he passed. Nobody believed me from the beginning but that\u2019s just what my family needed to not believe me even more. They seem to purposely brush off and ignore the fact that my sister told too and made her own allegations as well to make it sound like I made it all up as a nine year old child and like I tried \u201cruining an innocent man\u2019s life.\u201d They always chose him over me. \n\nThis is pretty much the pinpoint of my very ruined life. I am depressed and anxious always and paranoid something bad is going to happen. This has led me to be stupid and foolish enough to subject myself to even more abusive people and I do nothing but try to seek their approval or else I can\u2019t be happy. \n\nThese people obviously, never see me as good enough and just drain me of everything I can do for them. I don\u2019t know why people are like that, why I\u2019m so likely to be targeted, or why so many people see me as a target. I waste a lot of my time pondering it. Especially wondering why or how my family could never believe me, taking away so much support and healing I could\u2019ve had much sooner in my life.\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone ever will believe me and now I\u2019m much older so there\u2019s no evidence to anything I say anymore. I feel so set up and betrayed by the universe especially since the cycle of abuse in my life has been so repetitive and something I haven\u2019t managed to escape yet. I always feel like giving up but I have to keep going for my son which is heartwrenching to think about. \n\nI always feel so helpless, defenseless, emotional, overreactive, stupid, and deserving of almost every bad situation I go through. Nobody takes me seriously and I don\u2019t think anyone has ever truly been on my side. I\u2019m just not a person anyone could like or care about because I\u2019m disposable and never a loss to anybody. \n\nI just don\u2019t know how to move on or if I ever will, especially when bad things keep happening.

I was incredibly lonely and really wanted to make new friends with like minded people and eventually ended up hanging with the wrong crowd.\n\nFrom this crowd, I entered up in a relationship with a 19 year old guy who I was in a 2 year relationship with. I remember feeling so trapped in this relationship as he would constantly tell me I was a shit person, that I have no friends and that I am nothing without him and I just wasn't capable of leaving him as I felt incomplete as a person. The relationship was sexual and on one occasion when we had sex, the condom broke and he knowingly continued regardless and wouldn't offer support to help me get a morning after pill. This resulted in me having to reach out to my conservative mother as pharmarcies and services required that I had to be over 16 to get the morning after pill without parental consent. My mother was aware of the relationship and aware of how unhappy I was, but didn't do anything to stop it.\n\nAt the end of the relationship, he became physically abusive with me on two occasions. On one occasion he hit me when I drank too much with him and his friends and said he was just trying to 'snap me out of it'. On the second occasion, he strangled me on the bed, smashed my phone against the wall to prevent me having to call someone and ran after me when I tried to get away. From there he held me to the ground and pushed my face into the dirt and strangled me.\n\nI was very lucky to have met a wonderful man only 4 days after this event.

(27F // 37M)", "author": "redvelvetcupcake13", "self_text": "Today is officially one year of No Contact with my (27F) Narc (37M).\n\nA year ago, we had been fighting for a couple of days because he wanted to come over for sex and I told him no. After having minimal conversation with him over the weekend, I finally got a real response out of him where he, in the middle of 4 paragraphs of insults and attacks on my self-esteem, told me I wasn\u2019t worth his time if we weren\u2019t f\\*cking. Instead of responding, I blocked him. I blocked his number, walked into the gym, killed a workout, and walked out a different person. I went home and began blocking him everywhere. I gave his sweatshirt back to a mutual friend. A few days later, my roommate sat with me while I shredded birthday cards and letters and notes from him. A month later, I quit my job and moved away without telling him or anyone else who\u2019s friends with him where I was going. It was the best decision I ever made.\n\nI\u2019ve had a handful of hoovering attempts from him since then, but I have not given in. If you\u2019d told me a few years ago that I was going to choose to walk away, I wouldn\u2019t have believed you because I was so under his spell. I thought I loved him, he was my best friend, I fought so hard for him, and I couldn't imagine just leaving. If you\u2019d told me a year ago today that this time, for the first time, I wasn\u2019t going to go back to him, I wouldn\u2019t have believed you. I really didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d make it, but I did.\n\nI can listen to songs that I used to only associate with him again. I can watch movies that remind me of him without having an emotional response. I can see his name somewhere (it\u2019s a common one) and I just brush it off. I\u2019m not afraid of his hoovering attempts anymore. After 3 1/2 years of emotional abuse, silent treatments, gaslighting, and love-bombing, I did it. I finally chose myself over him.\n\nI made it to one year and I can\u2019t wait for many more. I am so proud of myself and I just really needed to share with a community that would understand. I didn\u2019t realize how good this would feel, but it feels amazing! I'm not perfect, I have my moments and I still have some anxieties about getting serious with someone else, but I'm trying. I'm strong.\n\nTo anyone on the fence about leaving, do it. It\u2019s incredible how much you can change in just a year when you\u2019re NC. I'm happier, I'm less anxious, I'm healthier, and I have better relationships with my family and friends.\n\nI feel so good having made it to this one year - it seems so little to so many people but to me it's like being one year sober.

I have been with my boyfriend on and off since 2011. When we met, i was on methadone recovering from a drug addiction. I thought i could handle being in a relationship with this man and his 2 kids. I wasn't ready to settle down at the time and we had both done things to lose trust in each other. We had taken many breaks. On those breaks we both saw other people.\n\n Fast forward to 2017..he left to Florida for a year and came back to NJ to see if we could fix our relationship one last time. I'm completely off methadone now and learned to trade stocks. My boyfriend takes credit for this even though i got clean and learned to trade while he was in Florida. He pushed me to get clean and i appreciate him for that. He also mentioned a few times to have my father teach me about investing and stocks since my father was an investor. My boyfriend constantly tells me i wouldn't be where I'm at now if it weren't for him. He also says I'll never find another man as good as him. \n\nMy father passed away this past June and I've been beyond stressed. I also want to add my boyfriend doesn't make much money and constantly asking me to pay for his expenses. I recently paid 6 months car insurance for him, i bought him a ps4 for Christmas. When he was out of work for a month i supported him and his kids. He thanks me but he complains constantly i don't do enough for him. He didn't get me anything for Christmas, my birthday which was in feb, or valentine's day..not even a simple card. But he always has money to spend on weed.\n\nHe recently asked me if we could open a joint bank account. At first i agreed, but thought about it (he owes 30g in child support.) I told him i don't want to open a joint account and he was angry saying that im only looking out for myself and my financial welfare. He lies a lotttt but has me believe i misunderstood or that we had already discussed the issue. I doubt myself and i wasn't like this before i met him. I'm also extremely insecure now and have extreme anxiety. \n\nA few weeks ago, i got my car towed to a body shop and boyfriend accused me of doing something shady..im guessing with the tow truck driver? Last night, i was looking through his friends list on Facebook and he blocked me! He accused me of trying to hack into his fb which i was not. A few days ago, my email password was changed and i noticed my boyfriend's email was linked with mine. I also noticed an email that had downloaded all data from my phone. He swears it wasn't him. I'm having a tech come check it out this week. All our arguments end with it being my fault and me having to improve and work on being a better person. And the arguments go on for days, sometimes weeks! It gets me so stressed i can't focus on work or anything else for that matter. And at the moment, I'm studying technical analysis on stock charts. I find myself unable to focus for more than a few minutes because I'm always angry at our relationship problems. \n\nHe wants to move into my house..i inherited my fathers house which is the home i grew up in and my mother lives with me. I refuse to have him move in because his kids still wet the bed..they are 11 and 15. And just because all our problems in general i don't think living together would solve anything. When i invite them for dinner, usually taco dinner, i ask the kids to help me cut up the vegetables for the tacos and they refuse. They don't do anything but stare at their screens. They are messy and don't clean up after themselves. I've tried to teach them basic things, such as using soap in the shower but they do what they want to do.\n\nBasically, i think I'm going to end the relationship. I ended it a few months ago but he'll come to my house uninvited to try and talk. He has me thinking I'm the only one doing wrong. Yes, I've done wrong in the past but i have been nothing but honest and trying my best this time around but it seems nothing is ever good enough for him. Ex: i paid his 6 month car insurance, he said i should of paid for a year! I have my own bills to pay too! \n\nI just want to know what you all think..is he a narcissist? He was diagnosed with bi polar and PTSD. And how do i get away and stay away? We always seem to end up back together. He hardly brings any positivity to my life, only misery. It's rare that we have a good day or good week together. \n\nI apologize again if my post is confusing. My head is all over the place. I appreciate any input :) ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We talked on social media for a number of years before going out on a date. The date was awful &amp; there was hardly any spark but because we had spoken for so long, we went on another date. To me it still didn\u2019t feel right although I was attracted to her. She had little things I didn\u2019t like or wouldn\u2019t normally look for in a woman, but I ignored them. We had sex &amp; she then suggested that we start to date. I didn\u2019t want to lose her, so I agreed. She wanted me to make it official &amp; post it on Facebook, so I did. I can remember her saying \u201cI hope tell each other that we love each other soon\u201d. Because of this I started saying it.\n\nBefore we started dating there were loads of red flags such as her blocking me on Facebook &amp; verbally abusing me. Being hot then cold &amp; never knowing how she was going to react, but I ignored them &amp; assumed I could change her, or it would get better when we started dating. Before we met, I was very na\u00efve &amp; looking back very need plus weak. I would buy her stuff &amp; send it by post plus pay phone bills &amp; wake her up every morning with a phone call.\n\nA few weeks into the relationship she started saying things about been friends. Like jokingly but it wasn\u2019t what I appreciated. She would say something like \u201cdo that again &amp; you\u2019ll end up friends\u201d. She would pretend that she couldn\u2019t see me to get a reaction out of me &amp; validate herself. When I noticed this, I told her that I have noticed what she was doing. She said she did it because she couldn\u2019t read me, so it was her way of knowing if I liked / loved her.\n\nWhat was strange is that I never really liked talking to her on the phone. I sort of avoided it when other women I have enjoyed it. Most of our relationship was over text messages. I can remember using well over 4000 texts to her in one month. Another strange thing is that we only saw each other once per week. We would meet at my house, watch a movie have sex &amp; sleep. This pattern continued for 2 years. We lived 6 miles away &amp; both have children to from another relationship, so I put this once a week thing down to that. It did work &amp; I enjoyed my own space &amp; so did she. She used to complain about her ex suffocating her &amp; always been at her home.\n\nI was 14 years older than her &amp; she said that she wouldn\u2019t tell anyone my age which I found odd &amp; she would mention things about me getting old &amp; not wanting to look after an old man while she still has her youth. This would really get to me to be honest &amp; I would remind her that she knew my age when we got together.\n\nShe stayed over at mine once for 2 days &amp; she said she couldn\u2019t have been with me any longer as she felt suffocated.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAfter a month or two the break ups started. This then became a normal occurrence &amp; happened at least once per month. I had to be constantly in contact with her via text or I would be accused of been cold or cheating. I then started walking on egg shells because of the threat of another break up. There was verbal abuse when the arguments got bad which did stop a little but went from her using really explicit words to less explicit ones. We would break up for a few days over stupid things that she would start but always manage to put the blame on me. We would then make up &amp; she would love bomb me for days! I can see now why I was getting attached to the highs &amp; the lows. I guess this is the Intermittent reinforcement which I am still craving to this day.\n\nIt\u2019s like we both knew we were not right for each other, but we had some kind of attachment.

So, I'm wondering how often does it happen that  a narcissist is not into marriage? Rarely?  What are your thoughts on such narcissists? It doesn't make sense because how much fuel they get by staying single always? Much less than being married and cheating?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if he manipulates women with his sad past into thinking that they have a chance with him to change him into a marrying type and that he is really in love with them and this time will be somehow different, it still doesn't make sense.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm confused was my ex really narcissist or maybe something else because of this? He was not somatic, he was not that good looking, he was not that good in bed, he didn't have money. I've always thought he was a covert narcissist. So this \"no marriage thing\" makes no sense to me and I'm questioning my judgement.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It\u2019s not really meant to teach some method with dealing with anything I just wanted to share a view point.\n\n1) I\u2019ll never be not bothered by narcissism. I think it\u2019s shitty, but in hindsight I do learn a lot from narcissists that I don\u2019t learn from my kind friends. (Boundaries, strength, badassness when needed, etc.) people don\u2019t fuck with me now as I know how to handle fucked up people.\n\n2) I know exactly the type of people in my life. I have very high standards. I only allow kind hearted souls to enter my true family circle. It\u2019s a blessing to know how to read good vs bad intentioned people.\n\n3) I have built an incredible relationship with myself internally because I had to heal. I know how to be a mama and a papa to my inner child and we are growing our love for each other every day.\n\n4) dealing with my own narcissist was hard to deal with but I now am confident I will not hurt other people any more with my own narcissism.\n\nThat\u2019s about it. I would rather not live with them, but they exist (clearly) and I will learn what I can from the situation. I\u2019m not gonna be friends with them, but at this point I try to look at the good side of them when I talk to them. When you get to know narcissists you\u2019ll see that the world made them who they are. Unfortunately they\u2019ll never change, but in a way it\u2019s not completely their fault they\u2019re assholes. At one point they were a dependent child who needed love and were rejected love and so they found a way to get \u201clove\u201d from the world.

(we have been 'best friends' since then). it turns out that, 2ish months into that time, he went out with and kissed another girl, they went on like 3 dates together. he hid this fact from me, and at the same time texted me hearts, cute gifs, and even answered a 5am phone call i made when i couldn't sleep (admittedly, that was a really weak moment for me).\n\ni guess it's my fault because i got triggered, and had to ask him if there was anyone in his life, if he was seeing someone new. and i'm angry, and hurt, and lost. there's nothing i can do about it now - it already happened. and as his friend, i don't really have the right anymore to tell him if he can date anyone else or not. but it hurts that he moved on so fast, and with a girl he's known for 4 years, and went out with a couple times before we ever started dating. it's almost like he kept her in the back of his mind as a viable \"option\" \"just in case\" things didn't work out... he denied this, but that's how i feel. she's moved back to another city, so he's not gonna see her anymore anyway - but he neglected to tell me this fact until i pressed for more information. so their relationship was a short fling that meant nothing serious, according to him. i don't know if i fully believe him.\n\nmoreover, i confronted him on a lot of things i've been feeling about him: that he's narcissistic, a liar, entitled, self-centered, doesn't know how to be intimate with women or treat us respectfully. that he strings girls along, and treats them crappy. &amp; that he's given me false hope over the 2ish years that we'd been together. he didn't even deny any of this - except he insisted that he's an open book, so honest, and would tell me anything.\n\nmaybe it's too soon for me to be posting here, i don't know what i'm looking for - validation? i have to learn to give that to myself. consolation? i don't feel that anyone can truly console me, because i just feel so completely alone. i know i'm the only one who can take care of myself - and that i need to reach out to supportive, constant people in my life.\n\ni just want to point out some red flags that i noticed in our conversation though - if they could be of help to anyone else. and i guess to keep some sort of a list of factual things that happened, so i don't forget later.\n\n* when i said to him that he gaslighted me, he *shouted,* \"HOW AM I GASLIGHTING YOU?\"\n* when i said to him, that his ex, who he was also in an LDR with a couple years ago and with whom things ended badly, probably felt this way - he said something like \"yeah , she probably did\" -  didn't even deny it. and when i said, \"i want to hear her side of the story\" he said \"me too / i want you to, too\". honestly this was a really weird reaction, i don't know what to make of it.\n* when i told him that he was abusive, he turned it around on me &amp; said, \"you're abusive, \\[name\\], my doctor thinks you're controlling, and so do two other people \\[these are random people online he vented to, that i don't know\\]\"\n* he kept insisting that his perception of things were \"true\", he even used the phrase \"objectively true\"\n* kept saying \"why can't you be happy for me?\" \"why can't you be happy that i'm doing well?\" \"i would be happy for you if you met someone new\". not understanding that, i'm hurt because this person told me that i'm his soulmate, more important to him than anyone else, that he loves me so much. of course it's gonna hurt - even if we're both single - that he goes out and kisses someone, hides it from me, lets me believe that he's being truthful, genuine, honest the whole time. it hurts more because we're long distance friends, and i could never possibly be there in person or compete with that. (and i don't want to compete. really. i'm exhausted.)\n* he called me the d-word, told me to f-off, in an angry rant that brought me to tears/left me numb and dissociated. after this angry rant, he was still completely in control of himself, his emotions, facial expressions, etc. i believe this was a rage meltdown, but im not sure. (i'm not completely blameless on the name calling front. i called him a lot of things: a warlock, a horrible person, an emotional vampire, a f\\*cking piece of sh\\*t \\[when i found out he'd been keeping that from me\\], that i hate his guts etc....)\n* he said that i need to try harder, and change (admittedly, i do think there are things that i need to work on, but hearing it from him is hurtful, not helpful - i'm so exhausted right now that i don't have the energy to do anymore trying or changing than i already am)\n* he went off on long, confusing, wordy tangents/rants, like he was talking in paragraphs, often contradicting himself &amp; confusing me - i'm autistic and have a really hard time keeping track of verbal input/conversation, and he knows that\n* my self esteem was pretty much destroyed after that and i had a lot of anxiety dreams, and woke up super stressed and tense.\n* i haven't been able to eat very much for like 2 days-food is making me nauseous. my mom says that when you're stressed out, your body's first reaction happens in the gut.\n* i shook/tremored all over when i was on the phone with him, both days.\n* somehow i still feel like this is all my fault and im having a ton of doubts about everything\n* i feel abandoned, alone, helpless.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He had a full on breakdown in front of everyone during the toasts, crying and sobbing like a baby saying what an amazing person I became. My husband cut him off and everyone else loved our wedding. Everyone saw how pathetic he is. He sat through the whole wedding reception and I stoicly ignored his shameful two faced show. He left completely shaken.

I've since been in several relationships and now only realize how bad it was. I also apologize for any spelling or grammar mistakes in this ahead of time. \n\n Me and her met via an online game, she was dating a dude at the time. Despite this she started flirting with me via messages, sometimes while we were playing games with her boyfriend or even in call with him(Discord). After at most a week she finally asked me if I was willing to join her relationship. Even then I was 90% sure I wasn't into dudes, but thought I'd try it at least once. Her boyfriend was chill and all, but his feelings for her faded and he left. She asked if I wanted to keep dating her in a mono-relationship and I said yes. \n\n It was only after the first few weeks of it just being us dating that I slowly realized how bad it was. She wasn't in the best place mentally and would blame me for everything, and I mean everything. From her not being able to focus, to her losing a game, or her being upset. Somehow it was my fault. There were times she'd whine and spam me when I didn't want to play with her or talk to one of her friends, I was and still am pretty shy/timid so I knew that even if I joined I'd be pretty quiet and not really say anything the whole time(I'm also not super into PDA and she was).\n\n She later opened up to me telling me she was scared she was pregnant. I was confused since 1: we were both girls and 2: we were long distance. She spilled and told me that she had unsafe sex with some dude near her. I've always been really bad about forgiving people too much so I let her back in and forgave her, but it definitely shun some light one some of her other actions. She continued to yell and belittle me constantly and push me to give all of my attention to her from the time I woke up till I went to sleep. I was still in school and was in GED classes, I was trying to stay up with everyone else by studying and always focusing on Homework first no matter how tired I was. So her trying to distract me constantly wasn't helping. \n\n Awhile later I had my first suicide attempt, I won't go into to much detail but a lot of the reasons was due to her. She constantly was over my shoulder, asking me about who I talked to to, where I was going, what I was doing, and constantly edging me to focus all of my attention and energy on our relationship. She ended up breaking up with me, but it wasn't clean. She blamed me for her life struggles once again and didn't even have the guts to call me and do it that way or talk to me afterwards. \n\n She later came back several times, we'd get back together and then break up after only maybe a month. She semi-recently tried to do it again however I finally told her off. She hasn't tried to message me since and I am so happy. She had messed me up in the past and in my clouded judgement after her I made some bad decisions that I regret, nothing life ruining but it still haunts me to this day.

I understand where my friends, family, and even strangers are coming from. Some have walked this path before knowing nothing good comes of it. But it's very difficult you see, not contacting you. I have so much I want to say, and you inadvertently play a role in my life even though we've never met. \n\nFrom what I gather, my children spend almost the same amount of time with you and your daughter as they do with V. That's a pretty big deal. That means that you are influencing them whether you intend to or not and you have a relationship with my children which I cannot deny. That being said, I do wonder why V hasn't introduced the both of us. \n\nDo you ever wonder too? Maybe you don't because he already gave you a reason that you deemed good enough. Perhaps he told you I'm crazy, and that I would surely start drama if we ever met. Or maybe he doesn't want to make you uncomfortable by bringing you in the middle of all the drama that already exists. \n\nMy guess is that he doesn't want us to meet because he's afraid. \n\nHe's afraid that I'll tell you that our divorce isn't final yet and that he's still my husband. But perhaps this is not news to you. He may be afraid that I'll tell you that he's an abuser and that's why I left him 8 months ago. He's afraid that I'll tell you the real truth about our marriage. Not the \"truth\" he's told you where I'm the crazy bitch who is selfish and suicidal among other things. \n\nYou see, that's not the truth. Not the whole truth anyway. He doesn't want me to tell you that he first put his hands on me a couple months after we said \"I do\". He doesn't want me to tell you that he lied to me about porn and other women more times than I can count on both hands. He doesn't want me to tell you that he dumped my spit on me, and hit me, and told me to kill myself while I was pregnant with our third. He probably doesn't want me to tell you that he broke my phone and that he mentally abused me for years to the point where I was suicidal. \n\nHas he showed you the infamous video yet? Where I hold scissors to my wrist in desperation? Maybe he has. \n\nMaybe like me, you wondered why someone who claims they love someone else would film such a moment of hurt and desperation instead of calling 911 to get help for them. I know now that this was evidence. This scenario played itself out a few times, actually. He would berate me, belittle me, and insult me to the point of utter frustration and when the rage came pouring out is when you would see satisfaction in his eyes. This happened so many times I began to believe I was crazy. \n\nYou see, I have a running list of abuse inflicted on me by him that include telling me multiple times that he was going to rape me in the middle of the night, punching and slapping me in front of our children, and clearing out our bank account so I wouldn't be able to leave him. I'm sure you've heard his twisted version of some of these offenses where he is surely the victim and I the abuser. This is why he wants to keep us apart. Because apart we are weaker. Because as long as we don't know each other, you will believe everything he says about me. \n\nI know what you might think. That I'm insecure, jealous, and vengeful. I would be lying if I said some part of me wasn't. For you to understand this, I ask you to put yourself in my shoes. But first, think of your life now. \n\nThink about the butterflies in your stomach every time you kiss my husband's lips. Think about how amazing he makes you feel when you make love to him. Think about the feeling you get when you see my husband's name pop up on your caller ID. Think about what you feel every time he looks into your eyes and tells you how beautiful you are. \n\nNow imagine if he slowly began abusing you mentally, physically, emotionally, financially, and sexually. Imagine if you endured 8 years of this. Imagine if you left him while 5 months pregnant with no job or money and tried to get a restraining order because you couldn't handle it anymore, only for it to get denied because you couldn't use the only evidence you had since it was a non-consensual recording of his abuse. \n\nImagine that two weeks after you left him he was crying to your family and friends telling them how much he loved you and wanted his family back. Now imagine during this same time your best friend found his profile on tinder. Imagine that over the course of the next few months, his mom and sister told you how much he loved you and your kids. Imagine that only a 2 weeks after having your third child, your two oldest children tell you that daddy took them to sleep at his new girlfriend's for the weekend. Imagine that while your husband is busy fucking another woman, you gave birth to your daughter and were doing your best not to fall apart while taking care of three kids. Imagine that.\n\nI think any normal person in that scenario would feel a little jealous and insecure don't you? Knowing that your husband is sleeping with another woman who just so happens to be beautiful and have a better body than yours, which is now extra beat up thanks to that third kid. Knowing that while you struggle, living off the government because you have no other choice, your husband is spending hundreds of dollars on his girlfriend, not caring to give you even a dime for your newborn daughter. \n\nThis is my reality, R. I didn't ask for this. In fact, if someone would've told me last year around this time that this is where I'd be, I would've never believed them.\n\nYou see, I didn't really know V until I left him. And you won't really know him until you leave him too.\n\nWhile you've been living a happy life with my husband and kids for the past few months, I've been through hell and back. But as difficult and arduous as it has been, I've found my sense of self again. I can't begin to express to you what a BIG FUCKING DEAL that is. I think back to all those times V tried to break me. I have flashbacks of tightening his belt around my neck just to see how close I could get to passing out. For so long I thought there was no escape. But I'm so relieved that after all those years I found it. For the last 8 months I've been processing the trauma I experienced since I was 16 at the hands of the man I thought was my best friend. I've gotten to a place where I don't care if anyone believes me anymore, because I know it happened. \n\nNow I worry for you and your daughter. Because I know your fate and it doesn't end well. It's not your fault. There's nothing you can do about it. No matter how much you love V, how well you treat him, how much sex you give him, or how attractive you make yourself, it will end the same way. You won't understand this now. You will have a hard time believing me because what I've described above is not the V you've seen. You've seen the V that loves you, cares for your daughter, is a great dad, and also hilarious and charismatic. But that isn't the real him. He's just pretending. It took me years to realize this. But I see it for what it is now and I'm so grateful. I hope you see it before it's too late. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

She told me on our very first date that she had to go see a psychiatrist the next day. I asked if I could ask why and she said it\u2019s personal. I often think she brought it up just for the sense of mystery so she could not tell me why. She liked to make me wonder like that. \n\nI know she was on medication she had to take every night but she was very mysterious about what for. I believe it did have something to do with regulating her moods because she told me she was prescribed them during a really bad time in her life. I kick myself for not asking more! She seemed like she didn\u2019t want to talk about it so I didn\u2019t want to pry but it seems like there was some undisclosed information about her mental health that became really apparent later when her behavior towards me became confusing and godawful.\n\nAnother thing is, she would go on and on about what an extremely hard time making friends she had and how she couldn\u2019t connect with people. She said she was an extreme control freak and I could see that in her rituals and patterns she played out every time we were together, like the way she got ready for bed every night had to be exactly the same and everything had to be perfectly organized. She told me she felt \u201cdifferent\u201d from other people and she had a \u201cbad brain\u201d that worked against her. She could be really dramatic and \u201cwoe is me\u201d I think to foster a sense of protectiveness in me. But I should\u2019ve pushed further on this stuff because now it seems like to me there was more going on then I realized.\n\nOnce I was alone in her dorm, she had a cupboard she told me to NEVER open. Just another one of her mysteries. Curiosity got the better of me and I opened it. It was probably close to a hundred sticky notes of negative comments she wrote about herself. How ugly she was and no one liked her. It horrified me. I told her I looked at it even though she told me not to and I consoled her all night, told her that stuff wasn\u2019t true and not to think that and to tell me if she was. It\u2019s horrible but even after the cheating and the discard and the brutal words, I feel really bad for her. I worry if she still thinks that stuff about herself. She is a sick person l mentally but there is so much I loved about her. But it\u2019s not my job to fix her. I hope she gets help someday and matures because she was my first love and I\u2019ll always love her even after what happened. I am still so confused really. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don't want to get in more trouble.\n\nHe has always had anger problems, but the thing I've thought a lot about the last few days. When me and my sister was little and we were on a car trip (we often went on these) alone with dad we usually played in the back seat to pass time (since a 5 hour car trip can get boring). Whenever we got a little loud he would tell us to stop. Fair enough, it's hard to drive for hours. So we went quiet for a while. Eventually we would start talking to eachother and he got so angry with us he would turn on the car radio and blast music so loud until he calmed down (usually about 10 minutes). Since the stereo was in the trunk we got all the sound from behind us, and after 10 minutes of metal music on max volume we had tinnitus for hours afterwards. This happened on multiple occasions, even if we would just ask him to pull over so you could pee or stretch your legs.\n\nI don't know if it's justified that he often were in a mad mood when he was going to drive for a few hours, but we recently found out that muy sister has hearing problems, and I immediately thought of all those times when he blasted music on max in the car. I just don't know.\n\nEdit: he do have anger problems, and there are tons of other stories but this thing just made me really worried since she discovered her hearing problem that could be caused by this", "subreddit": "abuse"}

That made me rage cry and feel emotions like I have never felt in my life. It felt so fucking unfair to me after the countless nights spent consoling her after mental health crises or buying her flowers and writing her poems and driving long distance so often to see her. After I had hyped her up so much and gave her advice and gave her so much love. I mean she doesn\u2019t owe me anything but its just so ungrateful and such a selfish thing to say to someone who clearly was not a shitty enough partner to justify that. I sacrificed too much for her of myself emotionally. To have it thrown into my face that I was a shitty boyfriend to her after discovering the world-breaking heartbreak of her months long secret relationship (but let\u2019s be honest here it probably wasn\u2019t the only secret) just made it even more confusing. difficult to process and trust shattering. \n\n\nShe looked at that hurt she caused me and she decided to add more which is the truly unforgivable sin of hers I feel, even worse than the cheating and lying. Fuck. I caught a girl cheating before and she broke down and told me she was cheating on me. Yeah I felt like shit but not to the extent of my last relationship. Somehow this horrible dragged out over-dramatic situation was even worse and more toxic than just being cheated on. \n\n\nI am acquaintances with one of her exes and I vented about this to him. He said yep. Pulled out his phone. Said trust me dude, I kept some of the text messages she sent me after we broke up to this day. He showed them to me and they were paragraphs of over the line hurtful things with the seeming purpose of literally just undermining his self-esteem and worth. To be honest this just really pisses me off. It isn\u2019t a solidarity thing for me, it\u2019s a \u201cso talking to people like complete shit is a pattern for her\u201d thing and it disgusts me. My parents were in an abusive relationship. I\u2019ve see plenty of horrible fights between couples. I think because she was very sheltered and hasn\u2019t seen that abuse before she doesn\u2019t understand the dark line she is toeing when she speaks to her partner like that.

I chickened out then and have been wanting to share my story since. I thought this may be a good forum. I feel shame and am hoping by sharing that I can feel a bit better about it.\n\nI grew up religious orthodox Jew. Initially, I was saving myself for marriage but at the time of this story I wasn't decided on what I wanted to do as I had been struggling with my religiosity for some time. I was 20 at the time. I worked in a camp kitchen over the summer and one night, myself, my friends in the kitchen and the cleaning staff were partying in one of the rooms. I was playing beer pong and one of the cleaning staff girls, who didn't speak much English, decided to play on my team. My opponent double sunk a cup, which with the rules we were playing with, means you need to drink all the beer. The girl was not drinking so I ended up drinking both teams beer and got drunk. Next thing I remember was my friends leaving the room and one sticking his head back in asking if I wanted a condom, to which I said no as I was not planning on having sex. Its a bit blurry at this point but next thing I know I'm on my back and she takes my clothes off and suddenly we're having sex. This is my first time and I lasted all of 10 seconds. Immediately afterwards, I got my wits about me, dressed and ran back to my room. I remember panicking and feeling ashamed of my actions. I thought this was my fault and that I should have said something or done something to prevent it.\n\nI emotionally shut down over the next two weeks and couldn't make eye contact with the girl. Next thing she tells is that she's pregnant. I tell my friends and they tell me to get her to take a pregnancy test which they pick up for me next time they are at the shop. I push her to take the test and she goes into the bathroom and comes back a few minutes later with one of the lines black and the other line looking like a bunch of scratches. I ask her what it means and she says in broken English \"Of course its pregnant.\" Two weeks go by in a blur and my friends tell me to get her to take a second test. After I ask the girl this, she avoids me but finally agree to do it, and it comes back with one line.\n\nFor the longest time I felt ashamed of this. I felt that I was a bad person for having sex before marriage. I felt it was my fault I didn't stop her. I still worry there is a child out there without a father who I am responsible for but not taking care of. I still deal with premature ejaculation issues every time I have sex and in the back of my mind feel guilt every time I do it with someone else. I try to convince myself it wasn't my fault and that I am the victim. This was probably the worst time in my life but I have gotten better at handling the negative emotions associated to this and talk to a therapist and take anti-depressants regularly to help deal with my emotional issues related to this and other aspects of depression. \n\nI don't know exactly what I'm hoping for from this post, but I just wanted to share.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

So my question for those of you, especially those that are non-confrontational or \u201cpushovers\u201d: how did you finally make your escape. I\u2019m strongly considering just leaving a note, and escaping while they\u2019re at work. Probably go as far as to moving a substantial amount of distance away and changing my number so I can sever all ties and opportunity for contact. I realize confronting in person might be better, but I have a strong feeling I\u2019ll be manipulated into staying and can\u2019t keep living like this. The toll - emotionally, physically, and with other relationships is becoming too much to bare. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I know some of you will think that's not possible with weed but when he is off of it, he is asshole x6. He isn't a pleasant person to be around.\n\nThe person he picks on most is my mom, who is 62. He always screams profanities at her if he doesn't get his way, throws shit at her, and threatens to hit her.\n\nMy mom won't call the cops on him because she doesn't want to ruin his life, when he is already ruining it by skipping school every day and becoming an addict.\n\nAnother thing my brother has done is steal my car and my girlfriend's car. He has stole mine twice, and has been lucky to come out alive after that (I was LIVID). He knows better than to steal my gfs car again saying she is ROTC and told him she'd kick his ass next time he did it. He has also stolen around 350 dollars worth of my money and 8k of my mom's.

And even though he knows better to not abuse me (I've taught him a lesson when we were kids by literally spraining his foot after he stole 100 dollars from me and called our mom a bitch,) he still abuses my mom whenever he gets the chance. Leaving my mom to doing whatever he wants, whenever he wants. And if he DOESN'T get it all hell breaks loose. \n\nI don't know what to do anymore. He threw some profanities at my mom today and a lamp at her face. He is a bright kid underneath all that macho, but chooses not to put that to use. And so, I'm at a loss. ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I hope I'll get more answers here.\n\nI left an abusive relationship with a narcissist a few months ago. At the beginning of the relationship, it was perfect bliss. He love bombed me and I felt loved like I never experienced in my life. This man was 21 years my senior, and I was totally in love with him. I honestly thought he was my soulmate.\n\nAfter knowing him and dating him for more than a year, I moved in with him (his idea). You all know what life with a narcissist ends up being like, right? Five months later, I was moving out of his house, broken and confused. He became a totally different person, and  his behaviour became abusive. So, I left him before it was too late. \n\n**My question is:** I never felt so close to anybody in my entire life. The sex was out of this world, and I felt so safe with him (before I saw his true colors). I felt like he could guess exactly what I wanted, what I liked, and how. A few months later, I am now dating a very ''normal'' guy,  whom I love, but I just can't seem to feel any desire for him (or for anybody else) since my break-up with my narcissist ex-boyfriend. I feel no attraction towards him, no pleasure during sex, nothing. I tried to sleep with some guys after my break-up, to reconnect with that part of me, and it was the same thing, so I don't think my current boyfriend is the problem. \n\nIs it normal ? I'm afraid I will not be able to recover from my abusive relationship. It's like he stole something from me. I wonder what is happening. Is it because sex was too good with my ex, and I keep comparing other men with him ? Or is it because I am afraid to let myself go, and be vulnerable ? I am trying really hard to overcome this, but I am failing so far. I used to be a very sexual person, but now, I lost my sex drive.\n\nI think I will see a sexologist, because I do not want to sabotage a good relationship, but I would like to know if anybody experienced something similar after breaking up with an abusive partner.\n\nThank you!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

There are a lot of memories that I had repressed and forgotten about,  but many of them came back to me within the past month. \n\nI have been happily married to my wonderful, non-abusive husband for almost a year now. I thought that I had worked through most of the abuse I went through in previous relationships, and I was doing well. \n\nThen I started remembering. \nNot allowed to say no.\nForced to lay there and take it.\nIf I say no, I get punished.\nIf I say no, it hurts.\nIf I lay there and take it, it's over quicker.\nI do anything he tells me to do, then he calls me a slut. A whore. \"If you're willing to do this for me, who else are you spreading your legs for?\" \nI was a virgin before you. I've been with no one else... but he continues to accuse me. That night, it hurts even though I don't say no. \n\nI was with him for 16 months. It was great, for the first three. Then slowly crumbled into a bad dream. But I was stuck. \n\nOne night, he tried to make me leave. Threw my stuff into the yard. I had no other place to live, I had no car. \n\nI texted one of our mutual friends, saying \"I may need a ride, A is throwing my stuff into the yard and telling me to leave.\" \n\nHe saw me texting, demanded to know who I was talking to. When I told him, he screamed at me for \"making him look bad to his friends\" followed by, \"they'll never help you, they were my friends first.\"\n\nHe tried to break my phone. I fought back. He slammed me against the wall, hand around my throat, choking me so I couldn't breathe. \n\nAs my vision went dark, and I could feel myself passing out, I mouthed the words \"I still love you.\" He let go and slept on the couch that night. The next day, as I'm covering the bruises on my throat with makeup, he tells me \"I was going to kill you last night, but I decided you weren't worth the trouble.\" \n\nI stayed with him for 3 more months before working up the courage to leave.\n\nWhen I left, I stayed with a \"friend\", C, who let me sleep on his couch. He soon proclaimed his feelings for me, and announced that we were dating. \n\nI should have known better, but I was so brainwashed and exhausted in every way that I justified it with \"at least he treats me better than A used to\" \n\nI let him think what he wanted to think, played the part when I was with him, then did whatever I wanted when he wasn't there. \n\nThis \"worked\" for almost a year. \n\nHe was very emotionally and mentally abusive and controlling, but he wasn't physically abusive, so I still thought I was better off. \n\nThen I told him I wanted to leave. That I was in love with someone else. \n\nHe seemed understanding, we hadn't technically been dating for months now, though we did continue as \"friends with benefits\" since I was still living with him, and he was originally very supportive of my decision to end the \"benefits\" part of being friends.\n\nThen he stopped asking. \n\nThe first time, we were both drunk. He started undressing me. I said no, I don't want to have sex with you anymore, plus I feel sick from drinking. \n\n\"Oh, it'll be okay, I'll make you feel good.\" \n\nAnd as I protested, he raped me. \n\nAnd continued to force me to have sex with him repeatedly over a couple months. \n\nI had no place to live if I left, so I felt trapped again. Just like the first time. And I began to feel like it was my fault for telling him no in the first place. \n\nI had been friends with my (now husband) through this entire time of both relationships, and we had become best friends. He was the one I would find escape in, because he always treated me like a human being. \n\nI slowly realised that I loved him, and I wanted to be with him, but I didn't say anything to him because I thought I was too broken, and he wouldn't want a mess like me. \n\nI finally decided that my life couldn't get any worse no matter what I did, and I told him my feelings. He loved me too. \n\nSo I started packing to leave in earnest. I told C that I was leaving, and that I was with (future husband) now. \n\nHe let me go. But only after raping me one last time, and forcibly impregnating me so he could have some sort of hold over me.\n\nI don't want kids, I have never wanted kids, and he was very well aware of this because it was something we argued about a lot. \n\nI had an abortion because I couldn't bring myself to have his baby, forced on me against my will.\n\nMy husband has been completely supportive of me, and has patiently helped me work through my abuse and relearning how to be in a non-abusive relationship.\n\nMy current problem is that I'm remembering details of the rape I experienced in both previous relationships, and it's making me unable to enjoy sex with my husband. \n\nI'm embarrassed to talk to him about this, even though I know he'll be understanding. I just feel so discouraged and dirty, and I keep having flashbacks while we're having sex, and I don't know how to deal with this. \n\n\n[P.S.

That somehow, because I was a boy, or because she and I were both young, that the psychological and later physical abuse was somehow less severe than it was.\n\nEveryone who could have helped didn't. Everyone who should have helped didn't believe me.\n\nWhen I was in middle school, I was coerced into dating this girl who was a high school freshman. I had dated someone else in her social circle in the past, who was the one who suggested this girl and I date. I was told by her friends to pretend that I was obsessed with the one I dated before, so this girl could intervene, and from there, I was instructed start pursuing her.\n\nI know now that something of that nature should be an absurdly vibrant red flag, but my stupidity and inexperience at the time didn't allow me to catch on. She was two years older than me, so I was ignorant enough to assume that she had experience and this is just how things worked.\u00a0\n\nThe ensuing relationship between her and I was nothing less than an unyielding catastrophe of manipulation and gaslighting.\u00a0\n\nShe was a very indirect person. She couldn't talk to me about things she saw wrong in the relationship. She would have her friends gang up on me and convince me that I was in the wrong, and this occurred often. It had gotten to the point that I had use her friends as a conduit between this girl and I, about everything up to me trying to break up *several times* over the year and some change that I was forced to date her. They would tell me that I had to fit her sexual perversities. Incest, bestiality, urination. I'd often pass the phone off to one of my friends to let them handle the sexting because I just couldn't stomach it.\n\nDuring that time, I had to lie about everything. Her friends would text me almost daily to instruct me to do and say things to make me interesting enough.\n\nNothing was too much for them. I had to pretend to have severe mental disorders, everything from psychosis to a made up \"autism-like\" syndrome, all to entertain this girl's psychology obsession. Hypersexual, habitual liar, over-emotional, and overall fake. I had to say that I was from England to seem interesting to her. I had to lie about writing all sorts of songs and poetry and whatever else because my own words were \"too brainy\". I had to become a quintessential emo kid for her to insult so she could feel better about herself.\n\nI had to go from my once pacifistic, tree hugging, almost hippie-self to becoming *that*. It left me with severe identity issues that I'm still seeking remedy for to this day.\n\nAt least I am given a small amount of solace in that I will never have to pretend to be British again.\n\nThings only got worse. When I started to buck, this girl and her friends would do something more to break me back into their control. I knew things were getting dangerous when a fake profile of me, my mom, and one of my friends appeared on Facebook. Needless to say, this girl and her friends swore to have nothing to do with it.\n\nThe closest friend I had at the time, who eventually became my life partner now, told me to start changing the last names and descriptions of my friends when I talked to this girl and her friends. And, of course, profiles appeared featuring my friends with their fake last names and profile pictures vaguely resembling the false descriptions I gave to this girl. I mention a fake life event, and not too much later, that same life event would be reflected on social media.\n\nIt was disturbing to see all of these fake profiles having conversations with one another in post comments. They even changed up how each \"person\" talked, making mistakes in grammar and misspelling things to make them seem unique.\n\nSo in a week's time, fake profiles started cropping up of me, my mother, my friends, even one named after my fucking xbox gamertag. It's terrifying, actually. I have no idea who these profiles were talking to or what they could have been saying. But I do know that I lost just about every friend I had at the time due to this girl pulling this crap. The only person who was close to me who wasn't impersonated like this was my now life partner, mostly because the only thing this girl knew about her was my nickname for her, \"snow\".\n\nThis girl's contorted perspective of reality led into the worst several years of my life. So, back when I was religious,\u00a0I went to church with this girl. Youth group, early evening on Wednesdays. At the time, I would very occasionally help my uncle who ran a business building koi ponds and fountains. I had this knife I'd wear on my belt for the various uses you'd have for a knife while working like that. Well, this particular Wednesday, I forgot to take the knife off of my belt. Before that youth group session, we were just hanging out in the church, doing nothing in particular when I noticed I still had that knife on me. I took it out, looked at it, wiped it off on my bracelet, and put it back in its sheathe.\u00a0\n\nApparently that can be construed as a mortal threat, because by the time I returned to school after, everyone was confronting me about it, and my reputation as a homicidal freak was cemented firmly enough to follow me for the rest of my school years.\n\nThat knife was out for maybe five seconds, and I was probably six feet away from this girl. I didn't point it at her, brandish it, I don't even think I made eye contact with her. But she didn't have any problem spinning that into her narrative that somehow the gentle, quiet kid who was habitually nonviolent just randomly decided to threaten her for no reason whatsoever.\n\nHer taking every measure to be the center of attention was a reoccurring theme.\n\nThat church would have a retreat every year, go out to a campground, a biking trail, typical church friendly fun for middle class kids. A week before going on that retreat with her, I got the news that one of my best friends was in a bad accident with a drunk driver while visiting his family in Missouri, was in the hospital with severe brain trauma and was likely going to die.\n\nHe ended up passing away the night before we left. I broke down about it while on the retreat, and when I got home, her friends were calling, texting, and otherwise harassing me about how selfish and horrible I was for \"making the trip about me\" and \"ruining the fun\".\n\nApparently mourning my best friend was interrupting this girl from being the center of attention. They harassed and harassed me to make me tell her that my friend \"awoke from his coma\" and everything was just fine and perfect in the world. I was stupid enough to agree to doing so.\n\nI texted her that he \"survived\" while sitting in the parking lot at his funeral. I've struggled with the memory and that feeling of self-loathing for years. I don't attend funerals anymore mostly due to this.\n\nAs despicable as things were, they got worse, fast.\u00a0\n\nHer friends got bored with me and probably told this girl to end things with me. I'm not going to lie, after losing literally everyone who I meant anything to, I was desperately relying on her company, no matter how tedious it became. I freaked out. I spammed her phone for that evening and for part of the day after.\n\nBut after that initial meltdown, I felt freedom. Like, I could talk to, be with, and do whatever I wanted to again, if only I knew how. But that freedom was short lived. This girl told me to stop talking to her, but her friends were there shortly after to tell me that she's not serious and she's \"just testing your loyalty\". I didn't ever want to talk to her but her friends consistently forced me into doing it.\n\nWord started circling around the school again, saying I tried to stab her, that I was stalking her,\u00a0that I raped her. My already dwindling confidence and reputation was now destroyed. I went from being unnoticed to being despised by everyone. I started receiving death threats via call and text. I had to delete my social media because I couldn't use it without being threatened and harassed.\n\nThis girl started distributing my address. I came home one night to find a copy of my school's band (of which she was a member) classes' syllabus was sitting on my front porch with a bullet sitting on top of it.\n\nPeople started following me home, I started getting attacked when found in public, people were waiting outside my house, waiting on me to leave for church or school. I was forced to become a shut in. I was a refugee in my own home.\n\nOne night when I was walking home, I was approached by three guys who started attacking me. They were holding me down while punching, kicking, and choking me. They dragged me onto a side street, held my face down in the gravel while they pulled down my pants and sodomized me. They started ripping at and striking my testicles and urinating on me. Sometimes I can still taste blood. I can still feel gravel under my palms.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMy urologist confirmed recently that it's unlikely that I'll ever father children due to the damage sustained during these attacks.\n\nYou hear the phrase \"tell an adult\" all the time growing up. I went to the youth pastor, who decided it would be more effective to group me together with my abuser, her friends, half a dozen people who had no business in the matter, and have us \"talk about it\". \"Talking about it\" amounts to me getting ganged up on and practically told that I was entirely in the wrong and that this girl was the victim and there was nothing to be done about it either which way. I went to that pastor in confidence about me being attacked and sexually assaulted, for her to seemingly go out of her way to make it everyone's business and ensure nothing of any real effect was done. Do you have any idea how humiliating it is to talk about being raped in front of immature student athletes and *the people who caused your trauma*? So I didn't. I made it about something else, anything else, until my emotions got the better of me and I left in tears\n\nI later pulled one of the women who attended that church into the youth group's recreational room to try to talk about the rape. I remember leaning against the pool table and trying to muster the words, trying to push down the anxiety and just get it out. I betrayed myself, breaking down in tears. It was too embarrassing. I lied and told her that I just wanted this girl back. She told me that nobody could force her hand in the matter. I wish somebody would have said that for me.\n\nOne of the other senior members of the church later called it an \"I hate you contest\".\n\nThe student resource officer at my school was the next person I talked to about it. The woman mentioned earlier had come to the school, where I was pulled into a room with my assistant principal and the SRO. The entire conversation boiled down to asking what kind of access I had to firearms. They only cared about the other students, their priority was making sure I wasn't going to shoot up the school. Nothing about the assaults were even mentioned. He said something along the lines of \"I'm not your enemy, but that doesn't make me your friend.\"\n\nThat same woman later said that it wasn't fair to talk about my abuse because my abuser wasn't there.\n\nShortly after I talked to the SRO, I recorded a conversation with this girl's friend, who was gloating about what was being done to me and saying that \"I better watch my back\". I took the recording to the school administration who took no time in telling me to hand over the recording or be expelled and charged with wiretapping. I found out later that in Tennessee, you have the right to record any conversation as long as you are participating in it and you aren't breaching an expectation of privacy.\n\nSo, you get told often growing up to \"tell an adult\". But they never tell you what to do if the adults don't listen.\n\nIn May of 2014, a close friend of this girl reached out to me and told me everything. She confessed to having a hand in what was happening, that it was tearing her up inside, gave me screenshots of text conversations where this girl was distributing my address and defaming me. She said that being a part of the situation was a mistake and that she wanted to leave it all behind and start college with a clean slate. I forgave her.\n\nIn July of 2017, I got in touch with this girl and had her give me her side of the story. She seemed to be unaware that her friend had given me damning proof of her involvement, so I just let her keep thinking that. I didn't know how to tell her what her friend had done. But, this girl had shown nothing in the way of maturing. She denied everything, insisting that I was not the victim, I made her life a living hell, and that all she wanted was for me to leave her alone.\n\nDid your friends know that?\n\nBut after that conversation, I changed my number, blocked her on every outfit of social media I could find, and decided that it's time to end this dilemma and make up for some lost time. I moved out into the county, changed my last name, got back in touch with Snow, and have been trying to recover. I was very hesitant to talk to a psychiatrist because psychology was this girl's major, and I didn't want to end up going to an office she might be working at.\n\nBut this is the first time I've opened up about this in detail. Every time I tried to do so in the past, I was called a liar, or my problems were belittled. It does still bother me that this girl will never see any justice for all the things she's costed me. I also know that I can't blame her anymore. Either she is absolutely sick in the head and needed professional help, started doing this out of peer pressure and just didn't know when to stop, or legitimately had no idea it was happening and was somehow blind to see what her friends were using her for. It's one of those questions I'm left to deal with. Who's to say those screenshots I was sent weren't faked?\n\nEither way, she can hide behind her lies all she wants to. It's just not my problem anymore.\n\nThe blame resides entirely on the shoulders of the adults I went to for help, who did nothing.\n\nSomething I often reflect on is just how much I didn't want to be in that relationship. This girl built herself up as some kind of god to me when really she was a girl I was coerced into dating, who I couldn't leave due to her obsessive and controlling friends.\n\nI never loved her. I never *liked* her. For a good majority of the time I knew her, I can even say I hated her. She's delusional in the aspect that she truly thinks she's somebody worth my time and adoration. Her personality is a plagiarized mess and she's as physically attractive as a bare concrete wall.\n\nI was reminded of that when I talked to her in 2017. That hour conversation made me feel like I was babysitting. I've had more engaging conversations with my two-year-old nephew.\n\nShe and I are never speaking again, and at that, nothing of value is lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR -\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was coerced into dating somebody when I was in 8th grade. The girl ended up, among other things, distributing my address, which resulted in me being stalked, attacked, and sexually assaulted. None of the adults I talked to about it cared, and I had no choice but to stay inside as much as possible until I was old enough to move out of my home town and change my last name.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I feel so out of it. I don\u2019t feel right. I keep feeling like I\u2019m the one who did everything wrong and that there\u2019s something wrong with me. It\u2019ll be a month on Saturday that I ended the relationship. I felt so terrible texting him that I didn\u2019t think we should continue, but at the same time I felt so relieved. I\u2019ve been crying off and on ever since. He\u2019s always been somewhat distant with me even though he says I\u2019m someone he feels he can talk to from time to time. We did have really good conversations a lot of the time, that felt like it was deep and genuine. But at the same time he\u2019s always talked about never showing someone \u201ceverything\u201d like he\u2019s afraid to put his guard down. He\u2019s talked about this like he\u2019s afraid of being hurt. But the way he goes about it just seems arrogant sometimes, like he\u2019s smug when talking about it. \n\nThe beginning of the relationship felt great. I felt like I was with someone I could build with over time. I felt like we understood each other and if we didn\u2019t we would be able to help the other understand. This seemed to change over time with misunderstandings being taken too seriously in a way that made us both angry. The last months of the relationship just felt so dead. I felt like everything was mundane and that we were both just waiting for it to be over. I didn\u2019t really feel as happy around him anymore and typing that just makes me cry so much more right now. I felt like he didn\u2019t want me around and that he felt the same way as me. I felt like going to his house became a chore, but also felt like if I didn\u2019t spend time with him it would upset us both. When I\u2019d stay home for the day all I would think about was him and how I wanted to go over there. At the same time though I constantly felt like I was neglecting my own house and life. I would want to spend so much time at his house that I wouldn\u2019t wash cloths when I needed to, I wouldn\u2019t clean my house, I wouldn\u2019t have good personal hygiene whether it be showering, eating habits, or sleep. I felt like I was a mess. And I constantly feel like I\u2019m a mess now. Still feeling like I can\u2019t take care of anything. Feeling neglectful with my own life and that makes me sad, that I\u2019d rather just be in the moment with people than care for my own life. \n\nWe had a lot of opposing view points on different things. Some were about ideal relationships. Depending on what kind of thing we\u2019d talk about he\u2019d get so angry to the point that I didn\u2019t want to talk about it anymore because I knew it would lead to an argument. He would never really communicate either, a problem I know we both have. When an argument would finally erupt after a long period it would be terrible. He\u2019d call me fake and that would make me want to say things to him but the way he\u2019d react would be worse. He\u2019d threaten the relationship a lot in these heated moments which made me not want to have them even more. So I let quiet for the most part, which probably wasn\u2019t ideal either. \n\nI guess that\u2019s why I feel so indifferent about everything is because the way I reacted to everything going on wasn\u2019t great either. I\u2019d get very angry that he was very angry. I\u2019d get angry with misunderstandings. I\u2019d get angry sometimes being in public places and that made him feel on edge. I know now that my behavior as well was not good and that\u2019s why I can\u2019t shake this feeling. I feel like I\u2019ve sabotaged the relationship as soon as I saw turmoil in it. \n\nFrom the recommendation from someone on this sub, I listened to the audiobook Psychopath free. It was very interesting to say the least and I recommend it as well. It made me really think about all of this from a different prospective. It also made me look more into myself. I realized that I have symptoms of BPD (I\u2019m not diagnosing myself, I know I need professional help and opinions). The majority of symptoms from BPD line up with me, the only ones that don\u2019t seem there are narcissism and lack of empathy. This is another reason I feel it\u2019s my fault that the relationship went so sour. I feel I had a hand to play in everything that was happening. I feel like my reactions caused some of our problems and that I built up non realistic problems in my head or possibilities of what could happen that it made me feel insecure to the point that there was a real problem. \n\n\nTo say the least, I need help. Professional help and that can\u2019t happen until I make it happen. I always push it aside for all kinds of reasons, but I\u2019m really tired of feeling this way and I\u2019m tired of feeling like a disappointment to people I care about. I just need to figure out what I can afford and go from there. I don\u2019t want to feel pain and discomfort anymore and I don\u2019t want to make others feel that way. I feel terrible to anyone that I\u2019ve been toxic to and I want to stop it from happening again. I just don\u2019t know how honestly.  Thanks for reading this stupid long vent post.

My sister insults me about something over practically every meal we ever went out for. \"You're eating wrong, why are you staring at me, oh my god you walk like an old lady, why do you twist the bread off like that that's weird just cut it, why don't you speak louder\" etc. My siblings tear apart everything I write and speak like  as if it was garbage.  They say things around me like \"oh you're gonna grow up a stripper\" \"You're gonna get pregnant before you get out of high school\" and make terrible remarks about my appearance. They knew I suffered from anorexia but on occasion insult my weight. They insult how I eat  as I stated earlier  ^. My sister told my grandmother I was a lesbian without my consent when I am NOT EVEN A LESBIAN!!!! She's made comments about me being a supposed lesbian and when I get upset she gets all offended like \"I just say these things to help you\" blah blah blah. They both see me as really immature.

Sorry, LONG!", "author": "gingergirl77", "self_text": "I was finally fed up, and the breaking point was something so stupid...after dealing with his terrible abuse, drinking, lies, games, for 10 years..yesterday was it. \n\nBuckle up, this is a bit long.  About 2 months ago, his estranged sister (who I have met once in 10 years, she had drug and addiction problems in the past and could be NPD herself), but anyway, she contacted me through Facebook about 2 months ago and started telling me about the abuse she endured from her brother growing up, etc etc. this isn\u2019t news to me, I know he was the first born, male, could do no wrong, all that crap.  I have heard about it before.  But I was messaging her back and commiserating with her...he had been on a non-stop abuse parade for about a week at that point, and I was just talking to her about what I have to deal with. I was basically just telling her that he has trashed talked me to everyone, always plays the victim and I can\u2019t believe anyone would believe him at this point, etc. she said no body does (which I don\u2019t know about, she lives 1000 miles away) and just told me I should get away for my sake...well of course, I didn\u2019t.\n\nI actually TOLD my BF about it, I asked if he had pissed her off or if something had happened because she reached out to me on Facebook about his abuse...well of course, he just said no and that she was probably back on drugs, etc. that was the end of that conversation (remember, over 2 months ago). \n\nSo he had been sober for the last week, for him that was the longest stretch of time without drinking in the 10 years that I have known him...except yesterday, he decided to get drunk. Called me up at about this time last night, and starts to accuse me of reaching out to his sister...at first I was shocked because we had this conversation about her reaching out to me and I told him all about it, so I just said, no I didn\u2019t reach out to her...she messaged me on Facebook and I just responded, I told him I had the messages still and would send them to him. He was literally pissed because \u201chis family\u201d told him that she told them I reached out to her....now I know that\u2019s not true, I have my own family and friends that I reach out to when it\u2019s bad, i have never reached out to her...I barely know her! \n\nAnyway...even re-reading all of that, you would think these people are in their 20\u2019s...nope. BF is 45, his sister is 43, his other brother is 40, and his parents are well into their 60\u2019s....(and all of them have drinking issues btw), but supposedly he was drinking with them and somehow this whole deal came up from his dad or mom or something...no clue, no idea why they were even talking about it, but all of them do like to talk about people behind their backs (they live in a tiny little town, I live 4 hours away in a city) it just seems like those people who stay in the little town they grew up in love to gossip. \n\nSo I got off the phone with him and went to look in messenger to send him the messages...then I realized...WTF am I doing?? Why am I playing into this crazy stupid drama...I told him the truth WHEN IT HAPPENED, and now he is saying his sister said something else to his parents, etc etc...and I thought, no...I don\u2019t want to have any part of this weird family dynamic or weird games they play, it\u2019s honestly like the family NEEDS drama to feel like a normal family and I realized I wanted no part in it.  \n\nSo I blocked him, on everything. Emails, Facebook, phone, etc. and to be honest, I feel nothing bad right now, no regret, no sadness...it\u2019s like that crap last night about something so stupid was it for me. I\u2019m not going to be triangulated, I\u2019m not going to be talked shit about and lied about behind my back, I\u2019m not going feed into anything like that. I\u2019m trying to stay above it all. \n\nI hope to god this was the final straw for me, I\u2019m sick of all of this and I think I finally had enough. Wish me luck!

When I defend myself its \"abuse\" and \"anger\" and when they attack me physically and verbally its justified. These sick people gaslight and emotionally manipulate me so much that I don't feel safe at all. I fear I am going to get murder and my family would cover it up. I am confident and no longer blame myself like I used to. These people are literally sociopath and the things they do are downright criminal. I work at this museum as a volunteer, I hope this can get me out of this prison. For years I assumed they actually cared but I don't exist and they treat me horribly. The truth only comes out what they actually think when I defend myself. This is so much to unpack but I needed to talk to anybody on this issue, advice is strongly needed. I have inheritance in my account but I have no car and everytime my \"parents\" take me into town no jobs are avaliable which is making this even worse.

At the beginning of the relationship I was lead to believe I was really selfish and really insecure, and that I had lacked maturity and understanding. I get so angry nowadays because I realize he knows my wounds and knows exactly what to say to cut me at my knees. These situations make me think my boyfriend is manipulative and is a narcissist:\n\n1. Says more than often that no one is like him: I will never meet anyone like him. in intellect; sexual openness; better understanding of everything around him. Sometimes goes so far as to say he knows me better than I know myself.  \n\n2. When I ask to simply let me know what time he\u2019s going to leave the next morning, so I can plan my day, he tells me that I\u2019M being inconsiderate for getting upset that he just gets up and leaves after I make breakfast.

Got it.\u201d \n\n4. That being said, he says I\u2019m not understanding enough for not being comfortable with him talking to me about other women. That I\u2019m not even willing to try. But I\u2019ve explained that I don\u2019t want to even open Pandora\u2019s box about that stuff as long as he and I aren\u2019t feeling good about ourselves and about each other. But it just turns into I\u2019m insecure. \n\n5. He claims he always tries to put himself in other people\u2019s shoes, but he gets upset when I get frustrated with #4 and I explain myself.\n\n6. First thing when he calls, he usually complains about work, or traffic or what have you. After he dumps his day on me, he says he has to go to make the round of phone calls to his family (his family is living a hard life, most are on the streets) so I understand that he has to go. But when I even complain about one thing at work, he says I\u2019m becoming \u201caggressive\u201d or just being sensitive.\n\n7. Always complains he can never catch a break and that I will never understand what he is going through.\n\n8. Says he rolls the dice heavy for me and has made more sacrifices in this relationship than I have.\n\n9. I hate keeping score but honestly, I cook for him, I give him gas money when he needs it, buy him groceries, let him dump his bad day on me (which is pretty much every day), He was laid off about 6 mo. ago and then finally got a job, still trying to make ends meet. I\u2019m no saint, but I live 45 minutes away and he comes over twice a week and complains, like everything else, about the traffic.\n\n10. Spoils himself when he does have extra cash with branded shirts and complains shit always happens that keeps him from getting on his feet. (another struggle that I also \u201cwill never understand\u201d but I think it\u2019s just poor money management lol)\n\n11. I never knew what gaslighting meant until a few months ago. When he told me even his ex-gf would give him her last dollar because that\u2019s how selfless she was. (manipulating me into apologizing for not offering to lend him money)\n\n12. When I get upset, there\u2019s usually shame, blame and guilt back at me. That I\u2019m not enough. And then tells me I\u2019m always playing the victim card. \n\n13. Reasons for his temper and behavior is usually, traffic made his day horrible, he\u2019s tired, he hasn\u2019t eaten, he\u2019s really stressed out about money, bills, family... and that I should understand.\n\n\n\nCan anyone confirm?

{"post_id": "b0w7nf", "created_utc": 1552539364, "title": "From a partner of a survivor. Need advice.", "author": "Peach_tree", "self_text": "Hi. My angel of a partner is struggling quite a bit and I feel like it\u2019s all my fault. She is a survivor of sexual abuse in her childhood. We\u2019ve been together 12 years and she never told me she had flashbacks. I suspected a few times after sex, but never knew the extent of it. \n\n\nLong story short, I had a breakdown due to work stress in October. This triggered my partner immensely, so I went to stay with my mom to protect her. She didn\u2019t do well being alone. When I came home for a night, it got even worse. I wasn\u2019t myself (due to a horrible reaction to benzodiazepines) and was so awful and she was so scared. I felt awful, especially since all I\u2019d been thinking about is getting better so I could get home to her. I ended up triggering her so badly in that one night she wanted to end the relationship. \n\n\nI came home in January and have been back since then. She\u2019s improved a bit. So have I. She agreed to go to couples counseling with me; she didn\u2019t want to at first but decided to after I said she didn\u2019t have to. She said she doesn\u2019t want to make any decision out of fear. She said she feels like an empty shell and incapable of being in love. She said she wants to be very good friends. I couldn\u2019t understand and was so hurt. In our first session two weeks ago, she admitted she has flashbacks regularly, especially when stressed. My heart exploded with compassion for her; I truly had no idea. So much of her and her reactions over the years started to make so much sense. And I realized how much I haven\u2019t understood and feel like an awful partner. She said she\u2019d love to be able to say \u201cYes, I\u2019d love you to,\u201d when I ask if I can kiss her, but she can\u2019t get in touch with that part of herself. She said she doesn\u2019t want any parts of intimacy at this point in her life anymore. She doesn\u2019t want to change. It seems that much of what she said about ending things was just to push me away because she was struggling so much.\n\nShe\u2019s been doing amazing since our last session (I think.) Immediately in the days after, she was giving me kisses and being herself again. Actually, more herself than she\u2019s been in years. She\u2019s had bad days where she\u2019s more withdrawn, but has still shown me bits and pieces of herself every day. I ask if it\u2019s okay to kiss her. Sometimes I ask if I can hold her hand at night in bed. Last night, after she\u2019s been sleeping on the far edge of her side of the bed for a very long time, she came to my side and tapped my shoulder gently with her hand and I held it. I guess that meant she wanted me to because she brushed her fingertips on my hand as she held it. \n\n\nHere\u2019s where I need advice. I think she\u2019s under the impression that I want more than she\u2019s giving me right now. She\u2019s very adamant when she makes assumptions and has a difficult time changing her mind and believing people. I want to tell her in our next session that sex is not a must-have for me in a romantic relationship and that her boundaries and consent are so important to me. If she\u2019s never ready or never wants to ever again, that is so okay with me. Her smile and laugh and kisses (if she\u2019s okay with giving them) mean so much more to me than sex ever could. It is impossible for me to want something that would hurt her so much. And to be honest, I would be very uncomfortable in a relationship where someone wanted sex more than me (because I don\u2019t want it very often at all.) That it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not her fault and wherever she is, I\u2019ll meet her there. I just need to know where her boundaries are.\n\n\nI really want this to go well. I see her in this totally new light and she is so sweet and I so do not want to lose her. Am I saying the right things? I don\u2019t want to make her feel weird or different or unworthy in any way. Is there anything I can add or should add? What would be important for your partner to understand if you were in her position? How do I help her? What do I do?\n\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the long post. And I appreciate any advice or helpful insight you can provide. I so wish I could empathize with her fully on this, but I can\u2019t even fathom how awful what she went through is.

He told me once, during sex, when I was naked and he was actually inside me, that I should lose weight. He told me I should go to the gym and lose weight more than once. He used to criticise every body part you can think of, including my vagina. He used to speak about past conquests and compare me (unfavourably) to them, she has an amazing body, you should do more squats, she\u2019s amazing in bed, you should get Ben wah balls to \u2018tighten it up\u2019. He cheated on me, and told me it was my fault for making him feel insecure. When I looked through his phone, I found messages to other girls telling them how amazing and perfect their bodies were, yet he could only criticise mine. Every time I challenged him on any of the above, he said my reaction was the problem, not his actions and I need to \u2018control\u2019 my emotions more. When he made comments about my weight he said it was out of concern for my health, or comments about other women were him \u2018not thinking, making silly comments\u2019. When I expressed how insecure I felt, he told me to go to the gym or have sex with him more often so I felt better about my \u2018skills\u2019 (he criticised me sexually too, I wasn\u2019t as good as his ex at x, y, z) I ended it more than once, and when I did he told me he would commit suicide as he \u2018couldn\u2019t live without me\u2019.

It turned into a toxic mess, with me pissed off at him for saying this shit and hurling insults back at him. It ended really badly, with me inappropriately messaging someone else. Truth be told I was enjoying the attention, but the other guy ended up hurt. This was months ago and things just don\u2019t seem to be getting better for me. I\u2019m holding on to so much anger, firstly at him for saying/doing all of this, but mostly at myself.

We were never in a relationship, although he later tried to blackmail me into one with him and I refused and ran. He followed me 5000K miles and broke into my mom's apartment to try to gain control over me again. Or something, idk. I'm just starting to process through some of this stuff, because what happened with my ASPD Nex took up so much of my thought life that I didn't even have time to think about this other creep, or want to. He repeatedly denied there were any alternative motives to him helping me. He said I showed so much potential for my field and he just wanted to see me succeed. What a fool I was. He was grooming me, plain and simple.\n\nBut tonight, I just realized something. He had supposedly secured modeling contracts for me with 3 different companies at an international fashion hub. I have friends who model in this city and I felt that I could be competitive within the industry in that same location, so I believed him. It could have been true, I don't know.\n\nBut I've been thinking through it again, and a thought just hit me that haunts me, and I'm not sure if it's hitting me because my Nex groomed me to be hyper-suspicious. Either way, here it goes.\n\nThis older narc openly admitted he had ties to the mob in a certain country. It made me wary but he framed it in a way that made it sound like he was trying to help them out of their life of crime. (That's before I realized he was a low level criminal himself.) Basically he was Sketchville, but still a far cry from being a sadistic psycho like my ex. Additionally he had many connections in the political realm, which as I discovered last year is also Sketchville x1000.\n\nHe mentioned that for some of my modeling gigs, I would be doing \"event hosting.\" That is, I would be at events and I would be expected to be the beautiful woman there to make attendees more comfortable. I would be expected to entertain and be charming. Some of the people at these parties would be rich businessmen and politicians. \"It will help you build more connections,\" he said. I didn't think much of it at the time, perhaps stupidly. But the more I am thinking about it tonight, the more it sounds like maybe he wanted to pimp me out as a call girl/escort. Idk, maybe I'm overreacting. It just seems too crazy. What happened with my nex was insane and I just couldn't handle it if there was another insane predator that I'd encountered. You can't just run into one psychotic predator and then again into another crazy one, can you? That doesn't just happen to people, right? It's too crazy, right? My ex wanted to rape, mutilate and kill me, and this bastard wanted to pimp me out? And they were both pretending to be Christians? No way. Please tell me I'm wrong. Please tell me I'm overreacting. It can't be that bad. This doesn't happen to people, right? You can't have TWO insane encounters like that, one right after the other, right? Please tell me I'm being paranoid.

{"post_id": "b0xcxk", "created_utc": 1552548168, "title": "How to Date After an Emotionally Abusive Relationship?", "author": "luna450", "self_text": "Hello everyone! (posted this also in /emotionalabuse)\n\nIn the beginning of 2017, I entered my first serious relationship, which also happened to be long-distance. Lasted for about a year. The beginning was perfect--of course. Within the first few months, I noticed a change in him. Whenever I brought up something that upset me in regards to our relationship, he would tell me I was \"too sensitive\". One example, that comes to mind from **many** is the time we were on the phone and it was our 8 month-anniversary. By this point, we literally only ~~talked~~ ***~~ONCE~~*** ~~a day~~, actually. I do not think 'talk' is the appropriate word. We literally had no communication whatsoever anymore. He would message me ONCE before he left to work at 7:10pm, on the dot, Sunday-Thursday. \"Going to work, take care, sleep well\". NO variation. Honestly, I don't even know how to describe to you guys the pain he put me through in those months, because it was so good in the beginning and then towards the end, we didn't even talk anymore. Anyways, back to the example. We were on the phone and I was telling him how I had fainted at the clinic because I was anemic. Had just found that out. He was like \"wait, what?\" and I reminded him I told him through text. I would send texts throughout the day, updating him on stuff that was happening in my life. He was like \"Oh, I don't read your messages anymore. I just skim them.\" That broke my heart. He was always too tired to video chat... too tired to talk on the phone. Felt like I had to beg for his attention.\n\nAnother time, he told me that he did not go out with his female friends, because he was giving me the place I deserve as his girlfriend. He expected me to do the same. I did not go out with any of my male friends throughout that year we dated. Just one female friend. One time he asked me if we were wasting our time dating one another. I was upset. I told him I did not feel that way, I asked if he did. He said no, but was simply wondering about it. I asked him if he wanted to break up. He told me, \"You're too sensitive. I am not going to bring up anything that's on my mind from now on. There's no point if you're just going to overreact. See, I can't tell you anything! What? You're going to cry?\" so from that point on I learned to keep my voice hush. If I was ever hurting or he made a hurtful remark. I kept quiet. I am sorry that this is all over the place. But that's how the flashbacks come. They're so disorganized at this point.\n\nI remember the beginning and how he was perfect. I remember the end. Not the same man. It hurts to remember that I could not ever bring up my feelings for the fear of him leaving me. For the fear of him calling me too sensitive and calling me dumb (said it quite a few times). He was never explicitly mean. He never called me a bitch or any other strong derogatory term, so it took me months to accept that this was not healthy. This was emotionally abusive. He KNEW he hurt me every time he purposely neglected me. He knew it. I would call him and he would not answer. One message a day! YET, he wouldn't break up with me, and he KNEW I did not have the heart to leave him. I loved him. When the relationship finally ended. I was devastated. I was broken. I became afraid. Terrified that all men will turn out to be like him. Perfect, romantic, my ideal guy, **THEN...** just change... become cold, cruel, invalidate my feelings. \n\nI swear, in that one year. I lost all self-love, self-worth, and self-respect I had. I did not feel good enough for him, or for anyone. I would cry myself to sleep every night wondering why I was not good enough for him. What was I missing? I felt so worthless. I was not deserving of ONE minute of my boyfriend's time. I literally would BEG for one minute to talk on the phone... and he would say \"no, not in the mood to talk to you. Tomorrow.\" Goodness, I do not know how I handled that treatment for a year. I was left an empty shell.\n\nThe last time we talked, in person, he told me he cheated on me. Then, he said he only told me that in order for me to forget him, but that he still loves me, but then he said he did cheat on me, then he said... you get the idea. He spent like two minutes contradicting himself that I was left more confused than ever. *Did you cheat or not?* Perhaps, I'll never know. Thanks, added trust issues to my fears.\n\nI recently met someone. In January, he asked me to be his girlfriend. I was so happy. He was the opposite of my ex. He doesn't make me feel like I cannot speak up. But, these past two weeks, I've felt this fear creeping in on me. Constantly reminding me of what happened with my ex. Reminding me that it **can** happen again. What if it does? I feel myself shutting down. I feel myself becoming more and more afraid of my relationship. I am scared that he will turn into my ex. I am scared that the neglect will begin soon. Right now, I just noticed that my boyfriend's texts are not as long as they used to be. He takes a little longer to reply, but he's working. I know he's had busy days. BUT, that's how it all began with my ex. He typed less... he took longer to reply... until it was only one message a day. What if this is the beginning of the end? No.. I remind myself that it's different. I actually see my boyfriend on the weekends. When we're together everything is great, so why am I so afraid? Why do I feel triggered? I am terrified of sabotaging my relationship. I don't want to lose him.\n\n\\-\n\nTL;DR: How do you begin a romantic relationship after having had experienced an emotionally abusive / toxic relationship?

I was really messed up from that special hell she put me through so I took a lot of time to re-learn me. To figure out who I was before her. I didn\u2019t date for almost two years, tons of therapy, self help, everything in between. I finally felt comfortable enough to date. I managed to meet another narc, however I caught the signs in time and dipped. Random dates here and there and being played, I almost gave up. I thought for sure I\u2019m way too damaged, not good enough, I\u2019m always being played so I started to revert back into the way I thought when I was with my Narc, I realized I was still suffering from things my Narc did. Finally, I met this amazing woman. Entirely out of left field and unexpected. We got serious and I had a melt down. Why? Why did I panic? What was my problem? She treats me better than anyone has in my life, including my parents, so why? To this day, I don\u2019t know why I freaked out. This woman came to me explaining how she understands and we can work through this, I\u2019m not crazy I was abused and just need to accept that I am not the problem.

I was at work and a person walked in, at a glance the same build, the same hair cut, the same clothing style. \nHe was taller though, and his hair wasn't shaved, just tightly curled, his voice was different. He was very friendly, bought his smokes and lotto tickets and chatted for a moment about the store. \nAll the while I tried to cool my red face and calm my racing heart. It was better after he left. \nMy ex put me through just over a year of emotional and mental abuse, though he only ever hit me a couple times. I didn't realize it was abuse until we broke up but still lived together. One of those roommates fall in love stories only, one of them has narcissistic and control issues. \nEvery day I was told I was stupid and my opinion was invalid. He told me my clothes were shit and that I had no sense of style. He dictated how I wore my hair, as \"white girls can't wear braids\"(I had one long old lady braid abd that was how I wore my hair to bed for years and whenever I was lazy but not feeling a ponytail). He made me wear socks around the house because my toes are \"too long\" (they're pretty normal, according to my husband....) His favorite thing was gaslighting me. We would have conversations and then he would act like they never happened. He would move things and then get furious at me for touching his stuff. He'd even get up to switch the thermostat down and then scream at me when he was cold in the morning. \nI told no one until I got out. The breaking point was one terrible week where he hit me, invited his ex to stay the weekend and told me I had to leave (I paid 500$ a month to live at that house!) And then gave my sweet dog a bloody nose because he peed out of fear. My dog and I left that weekend and I broke it off. We came back and he was even worse. I think I stayed there a couple weeks after that. I had no where else to go with an 80 pound pitbull mix. \nHe wouldn't even let me in to get my stuff. He and a female friend moved all of my stuff into boxes and out of the house. I lost a lot of stuff, nothing valuable but it was sentimental and he knew it. (One of them also snapped my baby fig tree about halfway down the stem and killed it)\nAnyway, that was just over two years ago. I haven't seen him except once, in his car. My bff lives next door so I knew it was possible. That never bothered me too much, I had her and her mom and her husband. \nBut yesterday, alone, at work? Where I know I will be forced to be friendly and courteous, and can't just leave my register? \nEverything fell out from under me. But it wasn't him. The guy it WAS is apparently a regular (I'm at a new store now, still learning these regulars) so it'll happen again. \nAnyway, it messed up my whole day. I got off about two hours later, and got home and was just a mess. I've been stressed as anything lately anyway. \nI wanted to tell my husband. I don't know, I guess mostly I just wanted to get it off my chest and be comforted. \nBut I didn't say anything, because a while ago husband said \"you talk about him all the time\" (I talk about the abuse, and the house, and the dog I left behind even though it wasn't my dog(it was his, mine went with me)) and \"you must have loved him\". When I said maybe in the beginning he rolled his eyes at me. \nHe doesn't get it. And that's fine, it's my shit and he doesn't have to get it. I figure I'll eventually get over it all, I'm working on it. I'm becoming a new version of myself, not who I was Before, and not who the ex turned me into, something new. It's just...taking a while. I feel like it shouldn't? Maybe that's society's thoughts over mine but I hate that seeing someone that WASNT EVEN HIM pushed me so far. I thought I was better. \n I couldn't say anything to him, so I dumped it here on you. Sorry. ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Their relationship with our classmates is ruined with pretty much everyone as they're a very toxic individual. They belittle others, give back handed compliments, compliment themselves in inappropriate situations, lie a lot etc Typical narcissist behaviour. After their relationship got ruined with almost everyone they know in our class, they decided to get close to me and become friends. I, already having trust issues and other mental problems, never trusted them from the beginning and always spotted their lies and weird behaviour which made it easy for me to deduce their personality disorder from the beginning. I also was really lazy and hated drama so I thought that breaking the 'friendship' wasn't worth the effort and I just went along with it. However, no matter how much we have in common, I just didn't feel comfortable with them as I didn't trust them and they were just generally a toxic person. So I came forward with them and talked to them about their personality disorder. I put myself in their shoes and spoke to them in a way that would make them more comfortable talking about their issue and uninsulted. It worked, and we had a long talk and worked things out and I also gave them advices to make their relationships better with people. The purpose of doing this is so I can hang out with them without them lying to me constantly, which I can always spot and is annoying, and without them giving me backhanded compliments. However, a few days later, they texted me and tried to take everything back and turn the situation on me and make me the bad guy for calling them out. It didn't work, I'm good at debating which permitted me to notice all fallacies in their argument. So, in the end, they resorted to giving a speech about how they're perfectly okay and how they have 'friends' that don't find them toxic and that everyone hating them is not their fault. Either way, I had nothing to lose from calling them out but I just want to know if I made the right decision and if there's a better way I could've done this.

I just wanted to share some of my observations and see what others think. \n\nWith ex Narc I realised that he would repeat many times to me throughout the relationship who he was. I realise this was to condition me to believe that\u2019s who he was despite his actions proving otherwise.\n\nWith the new guy these are some things I have picked up on him saying to me a lot;\n- he often says that he is cute when he does nice things for me or when he\u2019s being annoying he will say \u2018but you still find me cute\u2019 ... I find it odd for a guy to even want to call themselves cute \n- he tells me \u2018but you love me though\u2019 a lot even when it\u2019s really just not relevant \n- he says a lot that he\u2019s romantic even though he isn\u2019t if I\u2019m honest, he just does normal relationship stuff like suggesting going out for dinner isn\u2019t romantic yet he thinks it is because he will tell me how romantic it is of him \n\n...small things, but enough for me to wonder if he is conditioning me to see him in a certain light because he knows he is in fact not that person.. \n\nWe haven\u2019t known each other long maybe 5 months... and during an innocent chat I suggested stretching more would help with his back problems he told me to \u201cshut up, whatever, I\u2019m not in the mood to talk about it\u201d which I found rude and over-dramatic. It actually took me back a bit because I\u2019d never experienced that side of him. He later apologised and put it down to tiredness. However, I get tired a lot I have ptsd anxiety and depression, I have never lashed out at him. And we haven\u2019t known each other long so naturally you\u2019re hyper aware of how you come across right?\n\nMaybe a bit too much info for you all, (apologies in advance) but he is away a lot and we have before sent explicit videos back and fourth over an app (snapchat). One time we had texted about it throughout the day and arranged to do it again that evening. Later on we were on the phone and having a general chat and it was getting quite late and he just said \u201cright are we going to get this over and done with or what\u201d in an irritated tone. He was referring to the explicit videos and it made me feel like an object being used and my feelings didn\u2019t matter. He said sorry the next day and that he was just tired. I told him I no longer wanted to share those kind of videos/images anymore as that had made me uncomfortable. Fast forward a few months and he mentioned that - \u201cwe never send videos anymore, I guess that part of the relationship is over\u201d. I reminded him how well yeah, because you made me feel uncomfortable. Was he testing my boundaries maybe? His reply was nonchalant and jokey \u201coh yeah aha, sorry about that I wouldn\u2019t want you to do anything you\u2019re not comfortable with\u201d. But he still tries to instigate sexual conversations and I just ignore those parts of the text messages or tell him he should try not to attribute every convo to sex. He\u2019s since calmed down a bit. \n\nHe cries a lot. I revealed some info about my ex Narc and opened up to him. Since then he cries about stuff. Like when he talks about his family issues. Or when he talks about random things. Yet they\u2019re not actual tears. They\u2019re never actual tears tbh, just a little bit of water that sits on his eyelids. It makes me feel weird. Either they are genuine and I have some issues I need to work on in regards to seeing men cry and it not being a turn off  - or he is faking them. I recall my ex Narc once tried to cry and nothing came out and he said \u201csee I\u2019m so upset I can\u2019t even cry\u201d\nLOL! The fakery! \n\nDespite this, I always reassure him encourage him talk about his feeling and tell him it\u2019s okay to cry. I am supportive. But once I received a message from him saying \u201cyou\u2019re not the only one who needs help you know\u201d in regards to me opening up about my anxiety and trust issues caused by ex Narc. He encouraged me to open up and then his comment made me feel scolded for doing so. And since I am supportive of him it\u2019s not like I\u2019m being self-centred. Yet when I try offer help he doesn\u2019t want to open up or talk or says nothing is wrong with him - so then turning around and implying that I\u2019m overlooking his feelings and he struggles to is confusing... is this a slip of his mask and my emotions are a bother to him, but he needs to pretend to be caring whilst extracting vulnerable info to learn about me and tailor his abuse in the future?  \n\nWhen he does come over he always wants to sit with my family or hang out with my sister and her friends too. I find it odd. My family aren\u2019t the type where I would just go sit downstairs with them and my friends. I barely know him it\u2019s too fast to be having little family gatherings. Yet he\u2019s always saying why don\u2019t we go sit downstairs with your family and I say because they\u2019re tired from work and doing their own thing. Which is true. \n\nAnother thing is, if I am going downstairs to get something or I want to speak to my parents or something he will say I\u2019ll come with you. I\u2019ll tell him no, what for? I don\u2019t need you to? Like if we\u2019ve just had dinner and I go to take the plates down he\u2019ll say \u2018I\u2019ll come with you\u2019 and I\u2019ll tell him no it only takes 1 person to carry 2 plates downstairs. I just find it\u2019s like he\u2019s trying really hard to insert himself. Some might feel flattered by it like he just wants to be around them, I just find it invasive. Is he trying to get into my family\u2019s good books, figure them out to figure me out more and also invading my space to sort of bulldoze his way into my life? \n\nI also have reservations about triangulation - so I broke up with him at one point because he was too much too clingy too fast too soon. He pleaded for me to try make it work. Said he would go at my pace, on my terms if I feel uncomfortable to just discuss it. So after a few weeks space I agreed to give it another go. He then reveals how during those few weeks space he was speaking to an old friend he had a thing with and did offer to take her on a date for food. But cut it off and told her about me when we got back together. Now yes, I understand I broke up with him so in hindsight he can do as he pleases. However, normal people don\u2019t move on that fast and also plead for you back at the same time. But I do understand some people do these things to cover up their pain so I get that as a possibility. Although, he later admitted that he had actually downloaded the dating app tinder the same night I broke up with him - THE SAME NIGHT... that is extremely fast to already be trying to gain new attention.\n\nHe also has told me how he keeps in contact with people he use to have \u2018things\u2019 with -  or dated, and apparently they just didn\u2019t work out and are just friends. He messages these people a lot when we are together, I see it. I don\u2019t pry and ask questions or try see the nature of the convos. I just see when it comes up on his phone or he\u2019s sat next to me messaging them. Is he trying to triangulate me? It\u2019s common for narcs to surround themselves with former partners and potential flings etc so they have a constant supply of attention and adoration on standby. \n\nHowever, I do understand exes can be just friends. Although, let\u2019s be honest it\u2019s rare these days and the situation involving him downloading tinder the same night and asking another girl on a date is what makes me suspicious when combined with this info too.. \n\nThoughts? \n\nI\u2019m aware, I could be reading too much into things because of ex Narc, but better to be vigilant than naive again I say... \n\nEdit: he also never displays me on any of his social media - I have posted him on mine a few times, but he never does. It\u2019s not so much of an issue, but one instance made me question it. - on Valentine\u2019s Day he asked me if I was going to post a soppy post about him on social media and I said no I\u2019m not really that type, he seemed to be hinting for me to do it, but I didn\u2019t want to. I then flipped it back on him and said well you haven\u2019t posted one about me either so it\u2019s no big deal - his response was \u201cwell yeah, when I post stuff to do with other girls or pictures with girls in, I don\u2019t get that many likes\u201d - and I asked is that because it\u2019s mainly girls who like your social media things and are these girls that you\u2019ve had things with or maybe still have an interest in you? He just laughed. \n\nSo, in retrospect what came out of that conversation? Nothing. So what was the point of asking me about writing a soppy paragraph about him, knowing that he wouldn\u2019t write one about me anyway? Seems calculated somehow to evoke some specific reaction. \n\nEdit: He also refers to his ex a lot as a bitch and a psycho -  I know those are red flags.... something I also picked up on is he said she was moany...she would moan at him a lot about things. \n\nAt the start of our relationship he has made comments like \u2018you\u2019re not like my ex she would just moan at me for that, maybe I\u2019ve found a decent human being\u2019 hmmm triangulation? Idealising me and devaluing her. \n\nNow, I forgot to mention that when I said about him telling me to shut up for suggesting he stretch for his back - he later told me when he apologised that he just felt like I was moaning at him.... I immediately got my back up a bit and felt like I didn\u2019t want to be acting like his ex ....that feels like he\u2019s conditioning me to behave in certain ways in response to his actions by mentioning what his ex did to annoy him\n Eg.moan - but what he\u2019s really doing is telling me not to \u2018moan\u2019 like she did or I will most likely become crazy and psycho like how he refers to his ex?!

We started out as sort of a FWB, sort of dating, although he would never really call it that, never call me his girlfriend. I was pretty much ok with that because I could see his life was a mess and he wasn't someone I wanted to get myself tangled up with, but I got hooked. He needed to get out of his living situation so I stupidly let him move in with me, separate bedrooms, although we continued to hook up every so often. The intensity and frequency of that slowly tapered off as did his interest in me. We fought a lot. He is an alcoholic and would often get so drunk that he go off on me, berating me for one thing or another. Twice he screamed at the top of his lungs at me and I was so afraid I cowered in the corner and ended up apologizing all over myself the next day, even though I wasn't in the wrong. The push and pull dynamic of our relationship led me here. He's lovely dovey one day, can't stand the sight of me the next. It's so confusing. In the beginning he was possessive of me, would get jealous if I talked to other guys, now he tells me to bring guys home and fuck them, he doesn't care. \n\nI know he's been talking to other girls and lying to me about it. I stay the hell out of his business but he offers up the information. One night his phone notifications were going off like crazy and I said something like \"You're popular night!\" or something along those lines, just joking around. And he was like \"Yeah, my dad only likes to use FB messenger to communicate.\" And I know damn well that was the tinder notification going off, not FB. I don't care that he's talking to other girls, I care that he's lying to me, ESPECIALLY when he get so bent out of shape when he thinks I've lied to him. One day I didn't go to work because I felt depressed and I told him I didn't feel well and when he found out I was depressed he berated me for hours for lying to him. One set of rules for me, one for him. \n\nThe past few weekends he's been out of town. He hardly ever goes out of town but now all of a sudden he's gone all the time. Sometimes he disappears for a night. I didn't ask, but he told me the places he was supposedly going. Ok, fine. No problem. He said I might be home Saturday morning, maybe Sunday. Ok, fine, no problem. Sunday late evening rolls around and I haven't heard a thing from him since the night before when he was extremely drunk and trying to buy coke from some guy he met in the parking lot. So I text him and asked him if was coming home and he went off on me. I was just generally worried for his well-being but now he's calling me mom and asking my permission to go anywhere and mocking me saying should I call you every hour to check in?\n\nToday I found proof that he wasn't where he said he was over the weekend and he lied to my face and continues to lie to me. It's been the silent treatment since Sunday, closed doors, walking on eggshells again. Normally I'd fall all over myself trying to make things right and apologize and try to get on his good side again, but I really think I'm done this time. I'm trying to find the strength to kick him out of my house. I'm so conflicted and confused. I'm so mad, but also so sad. He's awful to me in so many ways, so why do I feel so sad and why am I replaying all the good times we had together? I wish I could cut all that out of my brain. \n\nIf you read this far thank you.

Even if I spent those days or weeks in a crying heap on my bed, wondering why I wasn\u2019t good enough. Why I couldn\u2019t be better. \n\nIn the last few months of the relationship, he told me I had to \u201cprove myself\u201d to him. He supposedly wasn\u2019t sure about me or the relationship, claimed I lured him back into it, so I needed to show him I could stop being so \u201cdramatic\u201d and \u201cargumentative\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d for him to decide on me. \n\nApparently proving myself to him meant, well, being quiet and not interacting with him.

That he had no relations to me. \n\nThe thing is, I feel like I was just too much effort for him. He obviously had his use for me with the arguments, but then it became about keeping me there for the occasional boost of supply rather than the primary.

I found it impossible to summon any control while asleep. The peeing happens without my knowledge or consent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother tried different things for a while, none of which worked. I was shamed. Yelled at, loudly and repeatedly. Given Chinese medicine. Painful acupuncture. Only half a bowl of soup. No more soup for dinner. No liquids at night. Threats of violence. Then finally, violence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first time she hit me was the first time I ever thought that I was going to die. I was still sleeping, and did not hear her come in. I am only made aware of her presence by her shriek, and then I feel pain. She had brought in the feather duster, so sure of the result she would find. I was getting hit repeatedly with full arm swing strikes in fast succession. When her arm tired she swapped hands. I was screaming instinctively in response but am unable to gain any sense of what was happening to me. The overload of pain and fear made room for no other sense to come to mind. I cower in the corner of my bed, she pulls me by the right ear. To prevent it being torn off I move myself toward the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe beating continues as my mom lets off steam. She is yelling at me but I am only aware of the volume. My eyes are focused on the weapon and how to avoid it. The feather duster is light. It is very difficult to dodge. My towel blanket is thrown over my face. Wet. She smushes my face in it, slamming my head into the surface behind me. I gag in my own urine and swallow it so I can breathe. Needing a breathe from my screaming I inhale the urine as well. I am being beat while held down to breathe through the urine soaked towel.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI manage to get the towel away, the beatings continue but now she has to chase me again. Me motivated only by where the last hit came from. Where the opposite direction was, I needed to go. She hits me on my arms, side and thighs the most. She's focusing on getting a body hit, not on hitting particular areas, until I started dodging around the room. Going where I could to avoid getting hit, even jumping on the study table and dresser and David's top bunk, but there was no hiding it. She was hitting me most of the time. She even hit my shin and the bottoms of my feet when she held my ankles. When I used my hands and head to protect parts in pain they would get hit as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mother pauses to catch her breath. She is panting from both the yelling and the beating. I gain my senses, now fully aware why she was mad. I did not know a mother could love a son so much. \"I TOLD YOU! I TOLD YOU I WOULD BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF YOU IF YOU DID IT AGAIN! YOU MADE ME DO THIS. YOU. YOU STUPID LITTLE SHIT CAN'T EVEN GET OUT OF BED AND WALK 10 STEPS TO THE BATHROOM AND PEE IN THE TOILET? WHAT KIND OF EVIL HUMAN BEING ARE YOU? WHAT KIND OF EVIL HUMAN BEING MAKES THEIR OWN MOTHER BEAT THEIR CHILD? YOU ARE AN EVIL HUMAN BEING FOR MAKING YOUR MOTHER CLEAN YOUR SHIT EVERY DAY. YOU LIKE WATCHING ME CLEAN YOUR SHIT EVERY DAY? DO YOU?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot liking the answer to her own rhetorical question, she pauses her speech to continue the beating. I no longer know what body part to use to protect which other. It hurts everywhere. I notice my screaming now, and try to weave in pleas for mercy. Please, I'm sorry. I am dying I tell her. Please don't kill me. I want to live. I'm sorry.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs my arms come up to protect my face I notice they are shredded. Blood welled up under the skin but did not spill out. The weapon, the bamboo handle of the feather duster, leaves long welts of bruised blood beneath the skin. My arms, chest, back, thighs and legs have all sustained serious injury. Welts have formed on top of welts to resemble deformed asterisks in various shades of yellow and purple. Even the non-obvious places like my eyes, cheeks, neck and the bottoms of my feet have been hit repeatedly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe feather duster is light and is easy to wield. It is a formidable weapon against a 4 year old.  \"ARE YOU HAPPY NOW? DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS AGAIN TOMORROW? DO YOU? YOU SICK LITTLE SHIT? TRY AND PEE IN YOUR BED AGAIN TONIGHT. I DARE YOU. I'M READY FOR YOU NOW.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe storms off. I wait until she is gone, and then I let myself cry in relief. I cuddle myself on the floor. My whole body aching just from the movement of my sobbing, except my heart. My heart feels so good to be alive. Then my lungs, so glad with each breathe in and then expressing that joy with each cry out. I am alive. She said she was going to beat me to death, but I am alive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat was the first time. Perhaps the worst, only because it was the most shocking. I peed in my bed until I was about 10 or 11 and was beat for it often. I can definitely recall a few times where I had been beaten longer, more times and with a harder weapon. With quick bursts of anger she often used just a hand. Across the face quickly, followed by an explanation of why I deserved it. The release of the guilt and anger was immediate.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing beat became a norm and a daily way of life. It was only a matter of time I did something that I should have known better not to do. Sometimes I would get beat before I go to sleep so the reminder is fresh before bed. Some times it would be saved up until the weekend, where I'd then be summoned to a room and then to lock it behind me. At least once she made me sleep with the feather duster to remind me what I had to look forward to in the morning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes it was civil. I was hit on my bum or my palm only the number of times I had peed in bed that week, or a multiple of times. Sometimes it was an arbitrary number, and when I did not agree with the number or started flinching before the number of hits could be completed, she would get angry and set the hit counter to infinite. Sometimes I would try to hide my wet sheets, and I would get beat after she investigated. She would catch me brushing my teeth, eating breakfast, in the shower. Sometimes I would be beat for other things unrelated to peeing in bed, some that I didn't even agree had anything to do with me. It made no difference what was said between the screams. Pleas for mercy, justice, insight. It was just noise.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn many nights after such beatings I would be afraid to sleep, wondering if it's possible I may not survive the next beating. Then I would startle awake in the middle of the night, wet again, and feel shame as I try to cry myself back to sleep until tomorrow's beating is likely to wake me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe beatings slowed gradually. My mother was finally adjusting to her stressful marriage, and my need to be appear normal and undamaged publicly increased. When I was 13, my school threatened to expel me when they discovered what was happening. She eventually changed tactics to emotional abuse. The last time she tried to hit me I was 18. I was used to the pain by then, and it could motivate me no longer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy did no one intervene on my behalf? Because I did not matter. I am the second son in a Chinese family. Abuse in my family is not only common it is a tradition. Not to say no one tried. There was a time when my father deemed I could not be beat if scars from last time were still visible, but that did not last. There was once when he came to talk to me and told me to smarten up and that I am in control of my own life but I did not listen. I continued to pee in bed and so he was right to make no further attempts to help me. My older brother's taunts and separate mountain of abuse was all done in good faith probably. He threatened me, shamed me and made me fear him because he wanted to challenge me to be a better person. Even my mother who was beating me was actually the one who wanted to help me the most. It was my fault I was peeing in my bed, I wasn't able to control myself. It was my actions that made her get angry, and she was only beating me for my own good.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA mother only wants best for her child.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: grammar.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

{"post_id": "b19kaj", "created_utc": 1552618486, "title": "It feels like god is giving me narcissist training", "author": "pencilwithnoeraser", "self_text": "Seriously, someone has got to be fucking with me right now.\n\nLast week we got a new security guard at my work. Part of my job involves me going to clean out the parking lot regularly, so when I went outside this new security guard started to walk with me and talk every time I went outside. Which is cool, that's usually the extent of my friendships with the security guards.However, I quickly noticed that he shares some *scarily* similar traits with my nex. He is also homeless, lives in his car, talks purely about himself and his accomplishments, and has already subtly put me down multiple times. Let me make it clear right now that I do not have any feelings whatsoever for him and couldn't care less if he works there or not. However, taking note of the ways he's already tried to establish control over me caught my attention and I wanted to post about it. This is strictly out of wondering, putting my narcissism research to the test, and trying to put the pieces together when comparing this with my ex.\n\nIt's been less than a week since I first met the new guard and there are already several big red flags.\n\n1. For starters, he's nearly 30. I just turned 20. I know for a fact he has the same routine of talking to the other girl who works in my department when she goes outside, and I heard from a coworker that he was complimenting her and trying to get at her so hard. Much like what he's trying to do with me.\n2. Which makes the next red flag, the fact that he literally offered to fuck me within 2 days of meeting me. That's cool and all for a tinder date but for it being a workplace and we're meeting in that environment? I'm definitely not accepting his offers ever and I'm going to tell him to stop the next time he does.\n3. He made that other girl fucking CRY. She came in from the parking lot the other day sobbing because of something he said to her. I suspect it was something sexual, he claims she thought he was being racist which doesn't make any sense whatsoever, and she won't talk about it. (She has issues already, she has blown up at coworkers in the past for much less so this isn't unusual for her. However, I wouldn't doubt for a second that he actually crossed a line.)\n\n4th red flag is where I want to elaborate and do some analyzing, because I swear I'm either going insane right now or some supernatural being is pranking me. He talks EXACTLY like my nex would. Literally everything is lining up with both my experiences with my ex and the things I've now learned about narcissism. I am very familiar with the red flags now and something already feels very off.It's been a *week* and he's trying to guilt me for the thing that happened with my coworker crying.Side note, I immediately felt that the \"relationship\" moved a lot more quickly than it should. I've been working there for over a year and I'm still not as close with some of my coworkers as it feels with the security guard. I think it's because one of the first things he found out about me was that I like art, which he does too, so we've been talking a lot about that. (A normal conversation for us is he'll come on to me, I'll ignore it, he'll start talking about art and I'll engage in the conversation. I do not directly feed into his efforts but I'm not shutting him down all the way either.)\n\nBut after the coworker thing happened, he keeps trying to tell me that he's such a great judge of character and that he knew she was crazy from the start (which is why he hit on her, right?) But then he starts going on about how he immediately knew I was cool and was going to be \"sane, unlike my coworker\". This gives me the impression that he's trying to create an \"us vs. them\" group with me and let me think I'm some sort of special... he \"sees\" something in me, therefore I should feel inclined to live up to his expectations, right?Not to mention that he immediately deemed her as crazy. Essentially: *Nope, not taking blame for any of that, she's just crazy, and you should believe me because she's crazy.* I initially stood up for her, giving reasons for why she might've acted like that and asking him if he really didn't say anything bad to her. He swore he didn't say anything bad, but I just told him I wasn't going to take sides because I didn't know both sides of the story and that it wasn't even really my business. It didn't seem like my attitude towards the situation was going to be a problem, because why the fuck would it be? In a normal world, things happen, people form different opinions about it, oh well, life goes on.\n\nHere's where things get interesting. I didn't reach out to him or anything the day after it happened (he has me on Instagram, \"for art stuff\"). He texted me today asking if I was good and starting a conversation. Suddenly he said,**\"All your other coworkers said she's crazy, it's not me and I really hate that you would believe anything she says.\"**\n\nOh. My god. That's exactly some shit my ex would say in this type of situation. Find some random, unrelated thing I did or didn't do to get mad over and try to guilt me for. Bonus points because I never even said that I believed her, I was just weighing both sides of the story -- which is exactly what my ex got upset over too. So not only is he starting a fight for nothing with a WORK ACQUAINTANCE, he's either jumping to an assumption that I believed her or he's trying to gaslight me and make me think that's what I did.\n\n**Me: \"Too bad, I don't rush to take sides bc why would I involve myself in that. Even if you did say something to her, it's not my business or my problem so why should I have feelings about it.\"**\n\n**Him: \"You saying even if I did makes me so heated. You thinking I would got me all the way fucked up. What time you work?\"**\n\nSo here, he's shifting the anger on to something else. Now it's not about whether I believe her, now it's about me even entertaining the thought that he's lying. I think that he wants me to believe he didn't hit on her so badly because he's trying to groom me into something so he needs me to have a good view of him as a man. He wants me to think he's \"loyal\" and that he only hits on me. And to deflect from how irrational and unnecessary the anger over this is, he ends his text with\n\n**Me: \"I don't know you? I've been through shit it's hard to tell who to trust. Why does what I think affect you that much lol\"**\n\n**Him: \"It doesn't but damn poor judgement of character. Bro everyone's been through something.\"**\n\nThis was the point where I ended the conversation because I felt like I traveled back a few months and was having a conversation with my nex. None of what he said was okay. From the beginning he's put a big emphasis on judgement of character and how he has this supreme gift at knowing people with a glance. Now he's saying that I suck at that, simply because I considered other points of view besides his own. Even worse, he's invalidating me being upfront saying that I've struggled with trust and is trying to make it seem like my struggles were no big deal because everyone has them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel that my observation of this guy, knowing what I know now, is pretty accurate judging by the red flags he continues to give me. However, I do have some doubt in myself. What if he's actually a normal dude and I'm putting his words under a microscope to find links to narcissism, because I'm so paranoid and terrified about it now? To be honest, that could be happening too for all I know. Part of me also wonders if I enabled him by flirting a bit at first and often initiating hanging out with him on my breaks. And a big part of me is just so scared that, if he is indeed a narcissist, he found me. Just like my ex found me. Narcissists know how to sniff out victims with low self-esteem and unstable boundaries. I'm scared that there's just something about me that screams \"potential victim\" even though I thought I was getting better and really starting to love myself. If I'm really better, why did this guy find me? Was I supposed to react like my coworker and immediately distance myself from him? What's wrong with me that I continue to find myself in contact with narcissists?\n\nJust some things I'm thinking about, wanted to organize my thoughts. I know this was super long so probably no one is reading this, but I just needed to get this out and really take a look at this guy. I don't know for sure if he's a narcissist but I'm definitely not sticking around to find out.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Dirty and clean clothes on the floor, dirty dishes sitting in the room for days, just sloppy as a 9-year-old brat (apologies to any neat, orderly 9-year-olds).  Oh, and this 24-year-old adult runs around the house in Pok\u00e9mon Pikachu pajamas, complete with hood and ears...\n\nSo whenever I wanted to talk to this creep about his supposed efforts to get his life straightened out, he went into an act of being \"stressed\" - and I wish I could provide a sound bite of this routine, because his voice got all high-pitched and hysterical, he'd turn red in the face and glare at me because it was my fault for daring to mention to him that he wasn't living up to the conditions of our verbal agreement.\n\nPoor baby.  I was raised in a viper's nest of two vicious narcissists who constantly scapegoated me, and they were drama queens.  In order to survive, I learned how to throw a temper tantrum with the best of them.  Whenever this yokel put on his \"I'm stressed!\" act, I roared at him that life was stressful and he'd damned well better learn how to handle it.\n\nMakes me wonder what kind of neglectful, over-indulgent and spoiling parents raised this cuckoo...\n\nI've given him notice to get out, but unfortunately since he was here for 8 months he has at least 28 days to a full month before he legally has to leave - and he's totally ignoring the situation.  As far as I can tell, he hasn't bothered to begin looking for another place, and the clock is ticking down.  He has 17 days left (out of 31) and due to his procrastination/delusional mental state/arrogant feelings of entitlement [pick one] he failed to look for a new room to rent within the first 8 days of the time period.\n\nThere was a room available for only $500 (I was charging him only $400) which if he'd jumped on it, he wouldn't even had to pay me the last month's rent.  However he failed to look online for any rooms, and the **ONLY** reason he knew about the cheap room is because I became disgusted with his I-don't-know-what-his-damage-is and printed out a few listings of available rooms.\n\nWhen I forced payment of the last month's rent because he still hadn't paid by the 8th, I told him that **he screwed himself**.  But he's still sinking or is sinking further into his whatever state of mind, refusing to do anything about getting out.\n\nHilariously he keeps telling me that ***I'm*** the narcissist...\n\nI confronted him about his failure to live up to ANY of the conditions I'd put on allowing him into my house - get a driver's license, older but reliable car, GED, look into community college or trade school so he won't be a fast-food worker for the rest of his life, but he hasn't done ANY of that.  I had to drive him to and fro from his temporary labor job, where he complained because they refused to pay him ***for his LUNCH HOUR***.\n\nAbout the time he'd worn thru their last nerves, he 'decided' to get a regular job (fast food restaurant) within walking distance of my house.  Because after 8 months of earning around 1200 a month TAKE HOME pay, he still hadn't saved up enough to buy an older car.  But he has bought vaping marijuana supplies and oils at least once a week, video games (one tab was for over $125), and vodka, all during that period.\n\nI wish the HELL that when he whined about not being able to come up with the rent and about to be kicked out of the previous place, and I saw the 4-foot by 3-foot big-screen TV, that I'd just taken him to a fleabag hotel and dumped him there for a week, paying cash, and after that he would have had to deal with his own shit.\n\nSo, here's the lesson I want to pass on to everyone else:\n\nIf anyone - and I do mean, **ANYONE** - asks you to let them move in with you, **CHECK the renter's and landlord's rights in your state, FIRST.**\n\nHave the paperwork ready to go for \"notice to quit\" and \"eviction\", before they even move in.\n\nOr better still, drive them to the nearest fleabag hotel and dump them there, paying (**IN CASH**) for a few nights (so they can't use your credit cards to continue charging for the room).\n\nTell them that if they've fulfilled certain obligations (get a job, get a car, get into rehab) before the few nights are up, you **MIGHT** consider paying for a few more days.\n\nIf not, that's their problem.  I don't like dumping this on the poor motel, but I suspect they're more practiced than most homeowners at dealing with this kind of idiot.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have been living with pain that hardly anyone knows about, and I'd like to get it out. My story spans across the entirety of my life (that I can remember) up until the moment I post this, so be prepared for a long read. I am on my phone, so please forgive the way this has been formatted.\n\nWhen I was in preschool my dad worked as a line cook, and my mother has a physical disability from when she was in the Army. I was made fun of because I'd always smell like smoke because my dad's work, and my parents were smokers. Or I was made fun of, because of my mom. Her shoulder was damaged in the military, and now it is smaller than the other one, and has a two very large scars. She can hardly move that arm. I would cry a lot, because I love my mom, and I didn't understand why, or how they could make fun of her just because she wasn't able to play like other moms of 3 and 4 year olds. This made me a bigger target for the bullying, because I would cry every day, and was weak.\n\nIn kindergarten, I'd get made fun of because I was a little slower, and a lot stranger than most kids. My teacher would mentally, and physically abuse me and other kids. But I got the worst of it. She almost dislocated my shoulder once, just because I ran to give my parents a hug when they showed up for an event. Whenever I answered something wrong, I'd be screamed at, and called stupid, and that I'd never make it to adulthood. Whenever I drew something, and was happy with it, I was told that it belonged in the trash, and so did I.\n\nIn 1st grade, it got worse. I'd get hit for trying to write with my left hand (my father is left handed and I thought it was really cool, so I wanted to try) and was constantly moved away from other children just because I liked making them laugh when they were sad. I was constantly shoved, and beat. I even had rocks thrown at me, just because I liked sitting in the sand when it was warmer.\n\nIn second grade, a kid would never leave me alone, and ended up making my back problems worse (more to this is in the petty revenge sub if you'd like to know). My teacher tried to stop it, but was ultimately unable to because the principal wouldn't move the bully, or I to a different class, nor would she allow me to stay inside during our breaks. We found out I was different because I have ADHD. I got on pills for it, and was called a pill popper up until 6th grade (the first year I got off of them).\n\nTime skip to middle school. This is where it gets a lot more serious.\n\nIn 7th grade, I thought I met someone I could actually trust, and that liked me for me. This is the year I got off if my ADHD meds, so I completely changed. Before I was a tired, Amory shell. Once I changed, I was happy, excited, and was enjoying life. She accused me of doing cocaine, and tried to get me arrested. And tried to accuse a close friend of mine of raping her. I was disliked by most of my teachers, even though I wasn't a bad student.\n\nIn 8th, one of my biggest inspirations in life attempted suicide, and died two days later. This took a huge toll on me. The night of his death, was the night I promised to never harm myself with a blade again (I used to cut, a lot. I will be 4 years clean this September). Though, the loss of an inspiration as big as he was, is what I believed to trigger my depression to finally surface in full (no one knew about me self harming). It was during this year, I was almost sexually assaulted by my ex-boyfriend. I was at his house, with him. He tried to shove his hand down my pants, while covering my mouth with the other so I couldn't scream. The only thing that stopped him is when his mom came in saying it was time to take me home.\n\n9th grade, more inspirations died, and it hurt. I was still having to see my Ex on a daily basis, along with the person I thought I could trust from 7th. I was still shoved constantly, and call very hurtful slurs (I'm half Russian, part Spaniard, and possibly part German).\n\nLast year, I was sexually assaulted by someone I've known since 7th grade. The only people who know are my current boyfriend, my best friend, who is practically my sister, myself, and the people of this sub reddit. I know he didn't know what he was doing, based on my reaction.. But it still happend. And I didn't want it. He didn't know that. But I did. He didn't rape me. But I was violated, nonetheless. A close friend of mine turned on me. She won't leave me alone now. I was in a toxic relationship, and ultimately had to break up with my then girlfriend, who I later found out is a compulsive liar.\n\nThis year, more friends have turned on me. I feel so alone. I haven't been eating right. I keep going on hunger streaks, and won't eat for days. Most of the time I don't even want to get out of bed. The only thing keeping me going at this point is my love for Egyptology, my hope for becoming an Egyptologist, my love for singing, my boyfriend, and my closest friend. My grades are dropping, and it is so hard to care at this point. I know I need help, but I can't afford therapy, and I'm afraid to speak out. I know none of you know me. But any help would be appreciated.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this. It truly means a lot to me.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

This is the worse break up I have ever had. I broke up with my son\u2019s mum 7 years ago who I had been with for 10 years &amp; I grieved but it was nothing like this. That was what I would call a good break up it that\u2019s even possible. We broke up because we just weren\u2019t getting on &amp; we planned it on when I would move out &amp; how child maintenance would be paid. It was hard for a few months especially when I found out that she had slept with my best friend, but I got over it &amp; all feelings I had for her finally went. \n\nThis breakup is completely different. I thought we were the perfect couple although from the start I had this heavy gut feeling something was wrong. This gut feeling prevented me from moving house near to her, It prevented me from planning on having a child with her like she wanted &amp; it prevented me from asking her to marry me just like she wanted. I knew deep down that her behaviour wasn\u2019t healthy although I convinced myself she would change, or I could change her. I remember after a few months of us dating she broke up with me over something stupid. I though it was over, so I tried like hell to get her back. I was an emotional wreck thinking that we were over for good. We got back together &amp; loved bombed me telling me how so glad she was that we made up &amp; how I was her baby forever. Then the second break up, then the third, fourth, fifth\u2026\u2026\u2026.. This continued for around stupid amount if times that I forget how many exactly but definitely more than 20. I went from being an emotional wreck to expecting it. I also felt like I was walking on egg shells to avoid these break ups. We lived 6 miles away &amp; we only saw each other once per week due to child commitments but it worked well. She said she liked her own space &amp; so did I but this meant we communicated by text all day. She just couldn\u2019t appreciate that I had a job &amp; sometimes I physically could not answer her texts immediately. This drove her nuts! She would ask me why its taken so long to reply or she would text me with questions marks or call me ignorant. She would accuse me of cheating &amp; if it wasn\u2019t this it was accusing me of chatting to women on Facebook which I wasn\u2019t. She would check my phone but keep hers by her side. I was questioned why I was on Facebook when I was online for more than 5 minutes but she was online 24/7. She said the break ups were never proper break ups. But to me when someone says \u2018we are over you\u2019re dead to me\u2019 or \u2018f\\*\\*k off out of my life &amp; leave me alone, delete my number you pr\\*\\*k\u2019 that is a real break up &amp; it hurt. We had 2 major break ups where we didn\u2019t speak for couple of weeks. One of those she ended the relationship by calling me \u2018fat, grotesque, out of her league &amp; told me she had to be drunk to sleep with me. After this I should of never got back together with her but I did which I see now just conditioned her to abuse me even more. Not once did I swear at her or call her anything insulting. \n\nAnother break up we had was just before we were going to go to the beach for the day. I cannot remember what she dumped me over, but I remember trying to get her to speak to me so that we could go on the day trip. I sent her loads of texts pleading with her &amp; she finally agreed. I picked her &amp; her daughter up &amp; she said to me that we still wasn\u2019t together &amp; she still hadn\u2019t forgiven me &amp; she asked why I wanted to take her away for the day. I said I didn\u2019t want to upset them as I thought that her daughter would be disappointed not been able to visit the beach. Her reply was \u2018we were not bothered, we had forgotten about it any way &amp; what kind of man takes their ex away for the day\u2019 she thought this was really amusing &amp; I burst out crying in my bathroom. I was glad that I could take them away but then I felt so heart broken that she had made fun of me &amp; took my caring nature for granted. \n\n5 months ago after we had not seen each other for a few weeks we met &amp; we watched a movie &amp; had sex. Prior to this after some sessions of therapy I had started setting boundaries which she didn\u2019t like. I stopped doing things for her like been her human alarm clock. She would ask me to phone her on a morning to wake her up but this got to the stage where I was phoning her 20 to 30 times before she woke up If she didn\u2019t she would blame it on me for not phoning enough times. I started being more assertive &amp; not putting up with her demands or when she would question my replies to texts. I think this really got to her as she started telling me I wasn\u2019t as caring as before &amp; tried insinuating that it was because I was interested in other women and chatting to them which I wasn\u2019t. So she broke up with me for the final time &amp; said she didn\u2019t love me any more which I found rather ironic as she tried hoovering me back 4 times. \n\nI am now left in a state of bewilderment. I\u2019m confused &amp; hurt. I keep thinking what if I could have treated her better. Maybe it was all my fault? Maybe she was just having a bad day? Maybe I didn\u2019t show her enough love? Maybe she had a bad childhood? Maybe the 20 or so break ups were not proper break ups &amp; I should have ignored them? \n\nMy heart misses her so so so much but my head tells me I must stay away from her. I have not answered any of her texts &amp; emails &amp; I haven\u2019t fallen for her plan of insulting me on Facebook to get a reaction. Her flirting with guys on Facebook &amp; posting provocative pictures shouting out how much fun she is having been single &amp; doing what ever she wants &amp; sleeping with whoever she wants isn\u2019t working either. Her emailing me telling me her relative was serious ill didn\u2019t get a reply although that was really difficult for me to ignore. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My parents changed the cable in our house when I was a kid...say 8, and before that, I watched Yu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds every Saturday. I loved that show. The new cable didn't have that channel, and I was devastated because the last few episodes were coming up, and I would miss them. \n\nI confided in my parents, and their reaction was bacially, \"tough luck\". Being a kid, I started sobbing...and admittedly cringey, but I also demanded to know how they would feel if their favorite shows got canceled or lost in the cable change. \n\nNow, I was a lonely little brat. I was the weird Asian kid in an all white class. My brother was mentally ill but not to the point they had to always had to watch over him but to the point where his reasoning skills were practically non existant, so they always sent me away to deal with him, and they never had time for me. I wasn't a priority then because of all the stress my brother put on them, so TV shows were all I had. \n\nThey laughed and acted patronizing, you know that clearly fake comforting cliche bullies do in those school movies. Thinking back, I don't blame them, but I'm still disappointed they laughed in the face of their distraught and crying 8 year old kid. \n\nI remember hiding in my room underneath my old comforter and swearing never to cry in front of them ever again. I decided that my emotions were worthless, and it would be better if I never had them at all. \n\n\nI keep that mindset now almost 12 years later. Idk, if you would call this bad emotional abuse, but it really messed up my emotional development. They're a lot better now, but I'm still incredibly guarded and anxious around them.

It's not neglect when a 50 year old man has to be forced by his 80-90 year old mother to help his homeless children. I feel it's obvious, but what do you guys think of this?\n\nBefore I start, when I say homeless I don't mean living on the street. What I mean is we were hopping from hotel to hotel getting thrown around by DSS and my father's VERY, VERY inconsistent help. Often times me, my brother, my Mom, and our two cats would be in our car for many hours during New York winter, which, for those that don't know, is pretty damn bad. So we had a roof over our heads most of the time, but no home.\n\nThere's a lot going on right now. My Dad is a compulsive liar and control freak who's been mentally and verbally abusing my mother ever since they split up and we (me, and my brother) went with my Mom. She can't just ignore him because he left us when my Mom had no job and hasn't had a job for 15 years, due to having to take care of 3 children, 2 of which (one being me) are autistic. Since she hasn't had a job for so long no one will hire her, meaning she has to go to my Dad for money, and he lies saying he has no money, or his checks don't go through or whatever else to avoid helping us. Also, my Dad has been living with his parents since he left, barely paying any rent, and has very low bills (which my Mom knows since she did ALL FINANCIALS for the WHOLE TIME THEY WERE TOGETHER, yet his parents believe him when he says he has no money, as well as everything else he says, which is abusive lies about my mother. So now, with nowhere to go, we have to live with my neglecting father and his parents who support and enable all of his awful actions towards us. With that background out of the way, here's what incited this post. In an argument with my Dad's mother, my grandmother, I asked her \"Is it neglect when my 50 year old father refuses to help his two homeless children until his mother FORCES HIM TO,\" which is what's been happening for months, since when my Dad refuses to help, my Mom has to call his mom. My grandmother then had the gall to say to my face that it is NOT NEGLECT when my father REFUSES TO HELP HIS TWO HOMELESS CHILDREN UNTIL HIS MOTHER FORCES HIM TO! Her excuse, which she also said to my face, was that \"He has no money,\" but HE OBVIOUSLY HAS MONEY IF SHE HERSELF HAS BEEN HANDED THE MONEY AFTER FORCING HIM TO HELP US! I'm really pissed off about it and needed to vent so I made this account. Luckily, my Mom got a job at the hotel we were in before, but it might not even be enough to get us out of here. :( Also, I had a phone interview with Wegman's and I really hope I get the job, because me, my brother, and my Mom need to leave this corrupted side of the family for good.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I left him two years ago in May. We met in high school when I was 14 and he was 15, and we dated until I was 18; my freshman year of high school to freshman year of college. My abuser used mental tactics such as gaslighting, ignoring, and putting me down, but there were times where he was physical. \n\nI didn't realize I was being abused until another man walked into my life and he treated me so kindly that it made me question my whole relationship. The questioning ended up being a good thing because I did leave my abuser and I am with the man I met today. My mental state was seriously broken down though and when I left, I was in the midst of a mental breakdown. I had no self esteem, I had bruises still healing on my arms, and looking back on pictures of myself, you can see how broken I look.\n\nIt's been two years. I'm in therapy. I still have panic attacks, I have some things that trigger me, and I continue to blame myself for things that aren't my fault. It's been two years and I'm still gluing myself back together, but I know these things take time.\n\nToday though, I told my story. Beforehand, there were very few who knew what truly happened. It was mostly close friends, and when I tried to tell some family members, they either didn't believe me, or they told me that I shouldn't talk down about him, but I didn't know how else to let these pent up feelings out that I had been dealing with for four years. \n\nAs I said, today would have been the six year anniversary. Last year, and this year, for the few days before this date, I have flashbacks, nightmares, and I haven't been sleeping very well at night. When I couldn't sleep, I started writing, and a poem came out of it... I shared that poem with my Facebook friends today. Some of them still know him and some still talk to him, but I just needed some sort of relief because I know he still talks down about me and he still denies that he did anything; he's called me crazy and said I don't know what I'm talking about. After we broke up, he happened to work with a friend of my mother's and told her that he thought I was going to kill myself which is why I left him. \n\nSo far, I've gotten some feedback. A couple of family members have realized what I truly was talking about. One girl who actually dated him for a couple weeks before him and I got together said she was surprised he ended up being like that, but she could believe it. \n\nI've got a feeling deep down in my gut that someone is going to show him the poem and I'll end up getting a nasty message or text from him. He's had me blocked on Facebook for a long time now, but if he does decide to contact me and berate me like he did when I left him, maybe I'll have proof that I'm not crazy and he's lying. \n\nI know half of this is probably some tangent, but there's just a lot going on in my head. I'd share the poem here, but I'd fear someone would find my Facebook account from it. If you read this though, thank you. ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

The first time was with one of my best friends, over a year ago. She sent me pictures and texts over snapchat, implying she was going to kill herself, and that I was the reason. She sent me a picture of a tape recorder with the caption, \"welcome to your tape\". If you don't know where this is from, its going off the show 13 Reasons Why, where Hannah, the character who commits suicide, makes tapes for all of the people who were to blame for her suicide. The next day she sent me a picture of a bathtub with razors. I didnt know if she was being serious or if this one all one sick joke. I was asking her what was going on but she wasn't answering any of my questions. Eventually I did call the police because she told me to. At the time I was in another state though, which made the process much longer because I had to call 911, tell them where the incident was taking place, and then have them redirect the call which took quite a while. I also tried calling her mom, but she wasn't answering, and none of her friends living close by could be bothered. She did end up being ok which was good of course, but I felt terrible. Everyone told me I did the right thing, but I only called because she told me to. What would've happened if she didnt tell me to call? And was this my fault? Was her suicide attempt my fault? Was I not a good friend? I eventually seperared myself from her, but I still feel guilty about it to this day. \n\nI also went though this with my ex. It was the typical manipulative, emotionally abusive bullshit. Saying that if I ever left him he'd kill himself and it would be my fault. He did this a few times, and it kept me apart of the relationship for sure. Even though I knew it was wrong there was a part of me that felt so shitty. Like I knew he was bullshitting, but what if he wasn't? He did a lot of screwed up things, but that one really fucked with me head. You should never be told you are the reason for someones suicide. The worst part is, I always tried to remain as open as possible. Like if anyone needed to talk, I would be there for them. To the point where I felt like I had no one to talk to about my own problems.

This love bombing got me hooked. We started dating and shit started to happen. The verbal, emotional abuse and constant break ups. \n\nWhat I've never understood is why she was strange sometimes when it came to seeing her. I kept my distance because I knew something was wrong so seeing her once per week worked for me but she was the same. Some times we only saw each other once per month. We only lived 6 miles away so the distance wasn't an issue. She said I wasn't allowed to just go round and if I did she wouldn't answer. She said that was because she likes to get ready and put make up on but I'd seen her plenty of morning's where her make up had come off. I never met her family apart from her mother a few times. She had no friends apart from one and all her other friends were either bitches or apparently jealous of her. She stayed at mine for 2 nights and said that was long enough and she needed some space plus she commented that she couldn't live with anyone. On the odd occasion she said she would like us to move in together and it would work because I would be at work and then the gym so we wouldn't be together all the time.

I was mortified, horrified, embarrassed, and scared. He was not only telling this to people, but to my ex boyfriend (he was always weirdly jealous of my exes).

Also, sorry if I make any mistakes, English is not my firs lenguage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, now I'm going out with a guy that it's very gentle and always listens to me. We are not anything serious but his personality has lead me to tell him things I almost haven't talked about with my closest friends.\n\nThis aslo brought back some memories of my relationship with my ex. We were together for 3 years +, and although he never touched he did wreck me mentally. I still have some issues with my self worth and confidence, but I think I can say I've dealt with almost everything.\n\nBut there is this incident that now I can't get out of my head. We were like other nights in his house, watching a film, eating pizza and drinking. I remember being drunk, and so was he. When time came to go to sleep I just wanted to close my eyes and doze off, but he didn't. It began with a simple kiss, which I was happy about. But then it went on and on, he was on top of me. One of his hands was getting under my shirt and the other one was trying to get between my legs, I didn't want it. I told him several times \"no\", it sounded soft due to my drunken and tired state, but I was saying it. And he was ignoring it. I began to panic, like really panic, I didn't understand why he was ignoring me, I even excused it in my head thinking he is not hearing me. But when his hand went inside my panties and started rubbing I finally reacted with more strenght, and I managed to push him off me.\n\nI had to almost threw him off the bed to make him stop, my words weren't enough, me crossing my legs wasn't enough, I had to almost threw him off the fucking bed.\n\nAfter that I imagened he would realise what just happend was wrong, and that he would apologise. That was my mistake, he got angry, yelled at me, called me frigid and a slut at the same time, then went to his side of the bed, lied down and turned his back to me. I was in disbelief, and asked him if he was serious. No answer of course, he had decided for the silent treatment (it wasn't the first time).\n\nThe worst part is that I wasn't angry, nor a little bit mad, just sad, feeling like the worst shit on the Earth. I was to tired or drunk to even try to my house, it was also too late to think about walking back on my own. I just laid there, next to him, crying. I keept telling myself that the next day he was going to apologise for sure. Again, my mistake. \n\nThe next day he treated me like crap, and practically kicked me out of his house. \n\nI didn't break up with him, we were together for a year and a half more. During this time the mental abuse continued, he was always shaming me for not being passionate enough or for not having enough sex. He made me feel so guilty that I ended up having sex with him just to please him, even if I didn't want to do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm proud to say that in the end I was able to see all the things wrong in the relationship, and was able to leave him. \n\nSometimes I'll catch myself thinking \"gosh, why were you so stupid, why did you let it happend\", but I know it wasn't my fault.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I'd never seen anything like it. When I told her I found out about all of it, I could've sworn she smirked. I started to pack my things up and she ran back into the room, stood in the doorway, and refused to let me leave if it meant we were broken up. I was so freaked out by what just happened, I just kind of said \"fine fine we're together\" just so she'd let me leave.  \n\n\nThe second time I tried to break up with her, she grabbed a duffel bag full of my stuff and kicked it down the stairs, turned around and punched a wall, then ran into the bathroom slamming the door. As I said before, I hadn't seen her act this way before. She says this is her depression. She said that i'm so distant and emotionally unavailable that I cause her to act like this. She would actually get mad at me for not fighting with her. I'm the type of person that just shuts down during stress. I keep my mouth shut and keep my distance. She absolutely hates it.  \n\n\nI hate that she can use her depression as an excuse but the minute I bring up my anxiety, she just talks about how it effects her.   \n\n\nThis time, I did it over the phone so I didn't have to deal with her violent outbursts. I told her it was because I couldn't trust her and because we just didn't feel like \"us\" anymore. She made sure to tell me it was my fault, of course. \"So this is happening because you don't trust me.\" Never mind the millions of reasons she gave me not to trust her, but I wasn't about to bring that up.  \n\n\nA few days later, she texted me saying her brother was in jail and her uncle died (all of which are true) and of course I tried to be there for her, as a friend. It was a huge mistake because she just pulled me right back in. It's become obvious that she wants me around as an option, as someone to run to when things get bad, but she's not interested in me as a person, not interested in spending time with me. She just panics when she doesn't have someone to talk about herself to. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow it's St. Patricks Day and everyone is out drinking and having a good time (I have to work in the morning) and of course I haven't heard a word from her all day/night, which she knows will just bring up my \"trust issues\" once again. I don't know if she is self-aware at all, or if she just runs around blindly doing all of these destructive things, but I could swear she does these things to get a rise out of me. I just want to block her number, block everything. I'm tired of feeling so crazy. But i'm stuck in that web of \"she was always there for me\" when I know damn well it was always her before me. I just don't know how to move on. I need NC but i'm so scared. We were together for two years. My anxiety and depression are at full-force to the point that i'm seeing a psychiatrist.

Like I'll be in the middle of Calc class and suddenly I'm 15 all over again and pinned to my bed and confused and timid and seeing his face loom over mine and it just keeps looping over, and over, and over. I tell myself I'm safe and in a different place, which then helps, but doesn't detract from the fact that this is part of my life story, it's not something I can disavow or rewrite and it haunts me wherever I go.\n\nIt's sort of like 'chasing the rabbit' from Pacific Rim? If I don't watch myself I'll just forever fall into that trauma and pain and the murky sorta limbo of my memories. And then sometimes the hatred and pain and resentment and hopelessness hits me and then I stay up or do terrible things to myself. I can't extricate myself from the pain. I don't blame the person or myself or bother thinking about things like that because where I am in life is definitely different (thank God) but I can't move forward because the pain from this chapter of my life is like a weight chained to my ankles.\n\nIt's like a riptide dragging me back into the darkest corners of my mind. I'm not even present half the time because I'm stuck absently having my worst memories on repeat like a bad YouTube loop in HD but edited shakily and choppily. I can't let go and move on.\n\nThe worst part is that most of the people in my life don't know what's going on. And the few that do don't always necessarily understand the full gravity of the situation or what happened. All my friends and family go out and live great lives and smile at one another and I'm left alone most of the time to smile when they catch me but then the pain and trauma settles back in when they go. It feels like I'm trapped in my head, and I know I'm not alone, because I know other people's stories and the statistics, but it doesn't because there is no dialogue to be had and so I feel more isolated than ever.\n\nI tried opening up to someone about this once. In a retrospect, they're a pathetic shit of a human (still are) and I shouldn't have listened to them. They said, \"eh, but to some people silence is consent\" and \"you said no but didn't stop him in the act, and so you're at fault.\" And so for the longest time I stayed in silence thinking I didn't have anything to complain about it. Then I started having anxiety attacks. Substance abuse. Self-harm came back. I played it off, pretending it was all fun and I was owning it, but I still felt dirty dirty dirty deep down and my smiles were shaky and confused and lost like I was but no one could see it.\n\nAnd I tried to keep explaining to him how I wasn't ready. He was a full year older than me. I was still a kid, a little girl in a lot of ways looking for just a moment in time. I didn't expect to have such bullshit thrown at me, I literally just wanted to watch cute Disney movies with a cute guy for fuck's sake. I just wanted other things. And yet every time he lavished on me like a sexual object and an object and not a person and he took advantage of my insecurity and feelings for him to use me to satisfy his own desire. I sat down with him almost every other day and tried to timidly (which was the best I could have done at the time) and yet every other day he violated me and I let it happen because I thought I was supposed to. But then there were also times where I yelled at him and told him I was not ok with things, and he did back off. He just had shit emotional quotient and shit at reading people, emotions, and communicating (to this day, he's still a shit about this).\n\nAnd as time went on and he matured and learned how to be less of a selfish self-absorbed piece of shit things did become legitimately consensual but I still can't take back what happened to me for six months and more. He's just a human who did monstrous things but out of ignorance, having never been taught better. And that sucks in a way, not ever being able hate him as just a monster or a shitty person, cuz he's just a stupid human and at the end of the day, human. \n\nThat's the brutality of it: in a relationship, it's never clear cut. Especially when you're just a confused young kid who's fallen in love the first time. I can't take things back that my firsts were beyond my control and I can't talk about these things openly without being stilted with pain and the complexity of things. He'll never have the capacity to understand what he put me through or how selfish he is. And he's not in my life anymore (thank God) but unlike the abuse I experienced from my parents, there is no opportunity for change or reconciliation. I think I've forgiven him, and I've accepted that I was wronged, but it is what it is and unlike what happened with my parents I'm struggling to deal with what I've got with no opportunity for change. And he probably wouldn't care either (he's kinda pathetic, if you can't tell by now).\n\nSo I guess to anyone who reads this and stumbles upon this in the future, silence is not consent. A no, even a super weak feeble no is a no. No does not mean nag until you get a yes. And sometimes, things will be done right by you. And sometimes things won't. But regardless of whatever happens, anything that is done wrong by you deserves to be recognized as such. Victims are victims because bad things happen to them, not because they didn't try hard enough to stop things. Because, in the first place, you don't deserve to even be put in a situation where you should have to feel unsafe in the first place. Stand up for yourself, take measure of your self worth and decide what you are ok with, and what you're not, and be prepared to lose people, but if you lose them that just means they're not worthy of you.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Maybe it wasn't a personality disorder and as I have posted recently most of the issues happened over text so maybe I could of avoided that part but we didn't live together and we had other commitments so texting was avoidable. \n\nThis is briefly what happened:\n\nShe broke up with me 30 times. She took great joy in calling me a fat grotesque pig who she had to be drunk to sleep with. She believed I was out of her league. She was only with me because she felt sorry for me. She constantly accused me of cheating and talking to women when she was talking to men. She added old equitances on Facebook to 'piss them off and get her revenge' because she was now with me. She dumped me for the last time bebause she said she didn't love me and her life was better without me in it then 2 weeks later she came back appologising but blaming me then accused me of cheating because I set boundaries and told her no more break ups. She then tried using guilt then insulting me to try and get a reaction and then telling me her relative had a terminal illness whilst ignoring the real reason that I didn't want to get back with her which was the 30 break ups which she tried down playing by saying that they wasn't real break ups. I felt like I was walking on egg shells because I never knew when another argument would start and when she would break up with me again. This went on for 2 years. \n\nCould I have mistaken it for immaturity and she would have stopped this behaviour in time? ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I remember crying for hours after that and not believing what I just saw. After that, I checked his computer and found a whole collection of similar videos.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I confronted him about it, he said that it arouses him to see \"their reaction\" the moment they get killed, which deeply shocked me and also scared me a lot because it sounds pretty much like something a serial killer would say.

He downright downplayed it and said that those videos probably weren't even real and anyway, the girls \"wanted it\" and \"craved for it\", so it wasn't a big deal. Then he also said, I should just stop making a fuss, as he always does. So in the end, he blamed me for even making a big deal out of it. Maybe I am, I don't know?

It crushed me and left me devastated for six months after until I learned about what had happened to me. Our relationship was only six months, but we had moved in together, shopped for houses, and made marriage plans. Her abuse was obvious and viscous.\n\nI recovered and learned to watch for warning signs....I just didn't realize how incredibly subtle and gradual and deceptive a N could be, so I was not prepared for the next one.\n\nWe have been together for 18 months, lived together for almost all of it. I moved across the country for her. Cared for her and her son every day....making breakfast or all of us and packing his lunch every weekday morning. Spent last summer and lots of my own money working on a gut job renovation of her house on top of my fulltime job. There has been nothing I wouldn't do for her and the narrative I had developed for myself made it feel like I had found my life's calling.\n\nShe rewarded me when she wanted to and I clung to that. She was mean. And critical. Destroyed my self esteem, stripped me of my hobbies, changed my clothes, and isolated me from everyone in my life. But it was always so subtle. She knows how to plant ideas and create just enough fear to get the desired behavior.\n\nBut I was happy. I started 2019 feeling on top of the world, even as she started dating other men and fucking them in the next room. I told myself we were in an open relationship and she played along with and into my delusion, while continuing to stifle my every effort to make even casual friends.\n\nI had lost my job at the end of last year and I think she was seizing on the opportunity to push her control to the extreme. She \"loved\" me for \"understanding her\" ...I was her puppet, nursing her back from hangovers she suffered from her prowls.\n\n....I was blind to all of it and was at an all time high, thinking we were the perfect love story, until one night in early February when she was out on a first date. I had a moment of clarity and put together what was happening. She had fooled me the same way she was fooling all of these new men...except she had convinced me to be \"part of her family\" and serve her every whim at the cost of my entire identity.\n\nI was crushed. I didn't want to believe it, but everything I read only confirmed my situation.\n\nEverything I was holding dear was a lie. I was thousands of miles from home. I had no place to go. Everyone I knew in the state were friends/coworkers of hers. \n\nOvernight, I went from the highest point in my life to the very bottom. That next day, I decided to end my life rather than fight to take it back. I attempted that afternoon, but it didn't work.\n\nHere I am, six weeks later. Conflicted, hopeless, not prepared to try braking free, keeping my realization to myself. This is the first time I have admitted my abuse to anyone. I covered for her and told everyone--friends, doctors, family--that my suicide attempt was just about unemployment. \n\nI'm pretending to her every day that I'm still unaware. I'm terrified of what would happen if she realized that I know. I have nowhere to run to.\n\nI guess writing this is a sign that I do have some hope. It's probably the most important step I've taken.

On the 5th month of finally being free of one demon she called me a motherhEcker 23 times from the moment i woke up to the moment i stopped digging a ditch in the rain.\n     I want freedom from this, but i dont know if im just being whiney. Last week she cornered me in the bathroom while i was putting towels away and then ripped the shower rack out of the wall and swung it wildly around me. She also tried to punch me but wouldnt hit me hard enough to bruise. At the same time that she does that she tries to buy my affection, so outside of her existence my life isnt that bad? Ive got a lack of social skills but when shes not around i kinda live good. I just dont know what to say, or do, ive openly said i wanted to call the police and she just taunts me over it.

I went back to the sidewalk and saw the woman still sitting on the porch and watching the situation.  i asked: why didn't you do anything to help me. you could have thrown something at the dog. she responded: \"it was not my dog that bit you\".\u00a0\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nstory no. 2, just calm down\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni was on a long intercontinental flight with my husband.\u00a0 we sat in the back. there were 2 empty seats adjacent to ours. as soon as the flight was safely in the air, a woman who was looking for more space appeared and sat in the end seat. she then proceeded to place her belongings on the, now the only available seat,  between the two of us. i asked her if it would be OK that i use the only available seat to get more space. she angrily said - no. then piled up all her luggage on the seat. as a response, i placed my purse on the same seat. she suddenly stood up, went somewhere and came back with a flight attendant.\u00a0 she must have manipulated and fabricated a story about me, since the flight attendant gave me a pretty stern lecture, then sent another to lecture me more.\u00a0 they did not ask the facts of what actually happened and did not listen to me, just kept on patronizing and lecturing. i tried to tell the flight attendant what actually happened, but the woman kept on saying that i was lying.\u00a0 i got upset\u00a0 because of the injustice and helplessness of my situation.\u00a0 this happened in front of other passengers and i got very embarrassed and humiliated.  i lost my composure and started crying. i was shaking all over. i knew that my husband dislikes it when i am emotional and tends to ignore me when i fall apart, but,  out of desperation, I turned to him and asked him to tell them the truth. he said nothing in my defense at first then, when i pleaded with him to state the truth, he barely spoke the words - she did not lie. he then asked me to calm down. it came out like i tried to talk him into saying the words he did not mean. the flight attendant looked at me like i was insane and also asked me to calm down. i sat motionless and speechless for the rest of the 10 hour flight.\u00a0 i could not speak to anyone.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Fast forward to now, he was married and was living with his wife but unsurprisingly it seems like he revealed his true colors to her while i was living almost calmly, because she vented to me about him being completely psychopathic, controlling, saying he called her horrible names and even choked her. I was extremely concerned and angry but... unsurprised at this. I still consoled her and told her to leave him and call the authorities if he tries something. Now they are divorced and I\u2019m happy for her but this only seemed to make it harder for me, since he moved back into my household with my mom. Just only days after he became comfortable he started showing his true colors once again, he started by calling me a whore, stripper, slut and accusing me of having an older boyfriend out of nowhere just to embarrass me and make me feel bad. He even bragged countless times about the amount of people he killed in Syria during combat, he had no emotions saying it and even seemed proud of it, which in turn was extremely terrifying and disgusting to me. As time passed after some months it turned into him calling me every name in the book, mainly a monster, parasite, ugly, saying that I will go nowhere in life and that I am weak and stupid, all in front of my mom which she didn\u2019t do anything about. Not only that but when I was around him at times he would constantly tackle and touch me for no reason despite me saying stop and telling him to leave me alone, once he even choked me in front of my mom to the point where I couldn\u2019t breathe and then days later he tackled me and touched my breast, he said it was on accident but told my mom that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know I had those\u201d which makes me think it was on purpose and it made me feel so disgusted and violated. He even started abusing my dog similarly and saying that he is ugly and that he should die, purposely taunting him to make him cry and even hitting him on occasions, and I felt so scared to go into the room to defend him because I could barely defend myself and it\u2019d just make the abuse worse. This spiraled into him constantly saying that I should die, that he wants me dead and is going to/wants to kill me, describing how he would in detail and saying that he\u2019d choke me and my dog to death while we sleep, he would even say this to my mom countless times on purpose very loudly so I could hear and feel upset. All of these events pretty much triggered a good amount of memories from childhood that I\u2019ve repressed that involved how he abused me constantly as a child and this made me feel even more terrified and extremely tired of having to deal with abuse once again. Just a few weeks ago my mom yelled at me for something small and my brother heard and joined in as usual saying that I was stupid and not going anywhere in life, so I said \u201cLook at you, you\u2019re only 24 and divorced and you\u2019re still here\u201d in attempts to defend myself and because I was tired of hearing the same words constantly. Almost immediately after that he ran to the bathroom I was in and smacked me extremely hard and I was terrified, I yelled at him that I would call the police on him for that and ran to my room to get my phone and he went after me and tackled me. At that point I thought he was going to kill me then and there, he had this same cold and empty terrifying look in his face that I remembered from when he\u2019d lash out at me as a child. He took my phone so I just ran out in the cold crying and scared, just wanting to escape from that situation and from him. My mom ended up running after me and taking me in her car and to a hotel for the night because I was scared of coming home. She gaslighted me and manipulated me about the abuse as usual but then convinced me that he signed a contract to leave to the marines and be stationed in Afghanistan eventually and that telling the authorities would ruin her and my brothers career, I was already scared at the possibility of foster care being worse so I did end up going back with her. I came back home with her a day later and weeks have passed since then but despite what happened he still hasn\u2019t stopped constantly making remarks about me and saying that he wants to kill me, I\u2019m terrified of the situation escalating even further and of him doing something even worse to me so I do as much as possible to stay in my room and never be around or talk to him, I ignore everything he says but it still hurts me. I also can't stop getting constant flashbacks to what happened and experiencing the same horrified feelings of what I felt the moment it was happening. I don\u2019t have anyone at all to turn to in case you want to know, I am planning on just being away as much as possible when I start going to actual school again (I am online schooled) and I\u2019m waiting for him to finally leave.

Both of my brothers excluded me in anything they could and were both extremely abusive, mentally and physically (hitting, choking, drowning, and threatening to kill me ), and one of my brothers sexually abused me for five years.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father could be mentally abusive sometimes when he was teaching me something, and if I didn't understand it he would grow agitated and start raising his voice, insult me and sometimes smack me (usually when he was a bit drunk). I grew a bit scared of my father during that time. However, he was nice for the rest, so I thought it was because I was a terrible child and I was lucky he was forgiving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy parents made so so many appointments with doctors and psychologists to discover what was wrong with me, that's when they found out I had dyslexia and ADD. I also had a small speech impediment and had a hard time with the three languages I was taught.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was and still, am ashamed of my learning disabilities. Soon I took Ritalin for it, and my school performance improved. When I was 10, we moved again to another country, the brother who sexually abused me moved with us, and the eldest stayed behind.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the new country, I was severely bullied for almost 4 years. I became better at school but struggled a lot. My parents fought more, and I had to stop them and smooth thing out with them. My mother became depressive. The brother no longer sexually abused me but became an addict and started growing physically abusive sometimes. I was bullied every day by classmates and 2 teachers. I had no friends and started gaining a lot of weight. My father would shame me when I complained about my life saying how good I had it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 12 I tried to commit suicide by jumping off the apartment we lived in; however, my cat was looking at me, and for some reason, I couldn't do it. Around the time I turned 13, I started to realize what my brothers had done to me, especially the sexual abuse and it took a colossal impact on me. I grew ashamed of myself and became depressive.\n\nWhen I was 13 I tried to overdose on sleeping pills and muscle relaxation pills, it was a failed attempt.\n\n4 months later I tried drowning myself, but I couldn't do it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen I met T, my first real friend. She was the first person I told about everything, and she too was sexually abused, but her family blamed her for it. Her family was messed up, and T was very abusive, shaming me, playing mind games and such.\n\n( I don't blame her, she was so damaged, but T I am so thankful for the good times, I hope you are doing well)\n\nA few months after being friends with T, a boy N who I had a crush on for 2 years confessed to me and hung out with me, I felt so happy, but I was just practice. 2 days after he had confessed to me he told me I was practice for the confession he told his crush. Again the shame of being used almost killed me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was 14, I met my first boyfriend F, he gave me so much hope but I went crazy. T didn't like that I had someone else in my life than her and left me. I was alone with F, F was sweet, but I was crazy. The girls at school slut-shamed me and made stories to make him break up with me, 2 months later he broke up with me. I was heartbroken, but also numb.\n\nThen we moved to another country, during that time my brothers made a mess out of their lives, dropping out, being addicts, and fucking up in general. I wanted to help them, and convinced myself I loved them. My parents vented their anger onto me and became controlling to prevent me from becoming like them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the new country, I became an only child and got my wonderful dog who I am so grateful for. I started the IB (international baccalaureate curriculum) because I felt some need to prove myself and thought my parents would love me more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe IB really took a lot out of me, and my self-esteem went down. I tried to kill myself due to the stress by overdosing, but again it failed. I also tried cutting my thighs to bleed to death, but I wanted to live for my dog because she is my joy in life. I slept less, only studied, worked and became more depressive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBoth my brothers often visited, and once when my brother was beating my dog I attacked him, I was almost sent to the hospital for what he later did to me. My mother told me I was looking for a fight, so it was my fault for what he did to me, but that he should still apologize, he didn't. Later both my brothers watched me shower, and I felt so disgusted, I told my parents, but they said it was a joke and to stop overreacting.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy father mocked me about my weight a lot, which turned me to turn bulimic, he knew and said I had to eat more vegetables. He shamed me for my weight and for what I was doing, I started starving myself, and he got angry, I don't have the time to join a sports team because of all the time I spent on my IB.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround the time I got a new friend R, R was a party girl who would often call me in the mornings to pick her up from bars, and she is very manipulative. One day I told R I needed to party (I wanted to forget all my problems like her), she said she would take care of me, instead she hooked up drunk 16 years old me with a stranger who went to have sex with me, I was unconscious for the most part and was too out of it to stop it. I tried to kill myself the next day by getting hit by a car, I felt disgusted but couldn't traumatize someone to kill myself. I got myself tested, and thank god I wasn't pregnant or had any STD's, my parents helped me but told me it was my fault. R said sorry but would often joke about it, I still hate myself for it and can't trust her. I sometimes blame her, but I know it was my fault.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got another friend M, who was adopted and very racist (said that white people will always oppress her black people) when I told her about my issues she said I should be grateful to be white and not black and adopted like her. She would sometimes hit me and left me. I spent more time with R since she was helping me, but M shamed me for leaving her, M is now away from school getting help, (M if you ever read this, I hope you got help).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAround this time my mother got breast cancer, and I was left to take care of her. My brothers got worse, and became more abusive towards me, my two old childhood friends also got worse, one of them got Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis and other epilepsy, they cut connections with me, and I felt terrible.\n\nAfter a while, my mom got better and tried to bring the family together, I confessed to my parents about what my brothers did to me since they were planning on setting me on a cruise with them sharing a bed and room. My parents helped me and told my brothers. The eldest brother broke off the relationship with me and still hasn't spoken to me for 2 years; I am okay with that. The other brother is trying to improve his life and get along with me, but I am not ready for any of it. My parents are pushing me to live a normal brother-sister relationship with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNOW that takes us to now. I am now 18 years old; soon I'll be taking my final exams and hopefully graduating. I have already applied to universities, and will soon hear if I got accepted. Now here comes the part I need help with.\n\nI am not happy.\n\nI don't know if I want to keep living. The past always haunts me, and I feel broken. I feel unworthy for love and disgusting, I haven't touched alcohol since the day it went wrong, and the university has a lot of that. I am afraid. I am lost.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat should I do? should I take a gap year to find myself, or got to university?\n\nWhat should I do about relationships? I have huge trust issues and am disgusted with myself.\n\nWhat should I do about my brother?\n\nI still feel stupid and can't stop hating myself.\n\nI still want to kill myself, but I want to become a mother, but I hate myself too much.\n\nI am so lost, and confused.\n\nThis is everything of me, please can you help me?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I am worried that this is the case). I recently told a friend about what I've been dealing with and she told me she thinks it is emotional abuse. I do not know so I am asking for help.\n\nMy (adoptive) parents are both white and in their 60s, while I am mixed race Asian. They are both really pretty far right traditional conservatives (though mostly my dad, and my mom is receptive when I tell her about science-based left leaning things like climate change or evolution, so I think she's a little less so), and usually I don't try to argue with them about anything political, but they are very outspoken and for some reason a lot of what they say has to do with race.\n\nMy father on occasion calls mixed people mutts. He does this in front of me even though I am mixed and didn't stop when I told him I kind of found it insulting a long time ago. I think he feels I'm being too sensitive. We have never been very close and don't talk much. He guilts me a lot because he feels I don't love him enough, and gets really angry at me if I don't hug him even though I'm just uncomfortable with it (I do not like touching or being touched and he knows that); he yells at me and grabs my wrists and stuff when he's frustrated by things I can't control (for example FAFSA errors because of poor network connection). \n\nHe may not even remember this but when I was younger maybe 12 he told me he wants to hit me all the time, but that he's a good person because he doesn't and that I should be grateful  for that (the incident that caused this was that I went to the school counselor for help because I was depressed and uh. Did not really want to be alive anymore and he thought I was looking for attention). I am very afraid of him because of this and ever since then I'm constantly on edge around him worried that I'm going to make him finally snap after all these years. I don't know if I'm just being paranoid. He yells at me and doesn't let me talk while he has the TV on but this is less of an issue than it used to be because I try not to have anything to say really unless he asks me to.\n\nI get the impression that he doesn't really like me being around and never seriously wanted me here because 1) my mother has told me how he agreed to adopt me as a \"surprise\" to make her happy and 2) he explicitly stated on his half of the adoption papers that he only wanted a white child--he knows I've seen this but has never addressed it. I know that they were rejected for three potential adoptees before me. I'm aware that that isn't under their control, but I still feel like leftovers.\n\nWhenever I would try to talk to them about issues from school involving racism, they would tell me that I was just being too sensitive and that the kids who were bullying me were only joking. Even in very overt cases like other children pulling the corners of their eyes back at me. I do not talk to them about things like this anymore.\n\nMy grandfather has been visiting lately and calls Chinese people \"chinamen\" in front of me, to my face (to clarify I am mixed Chinese/Vietnamese/German(?) and they know this). Nobody does anything about this. My parents don't seem uncomfortable with it at all and I know if I speak up about how weird it makes me feel I will probably just get yelled at.\n\nRecently I overheard my mother defending some television personality who is under fire for some reason or another, but the way she talked about it just drove me nuts. She said that the person in question was \"a white girl, Christian, just the perfect girl next door. So innocent.\" I have no idea how to feel about this. I really want to believe I misheard. This is the worst because I always felt like she was at least a little more on my side and any of the stuff she said like this was just Dad pressuring her into agreeing, but it was about a program she watches and definitely not something he would care about (on the Hallmark channel or HGTV or something like it). I'm so scared that she thinks I'm less innocent than a white kid would be because of how I was born.\n\nThings like this happen often. These are just the major incidents I remember and stuff that is recent. It's hard to think about so I try not to and don't remember a lot. Am I overreacting? I can't tell. Please help\n\nSorry if this is too much. Also sorry if this is formatted wrong because I never really use this website.\n\nEdit: I also want to clarify that aside from my dad who pretty much doesn't interact with me unless we have to my family is nice to me and treats me equally to their two biological kids. It's just like they don't want to acknowledge that I'm Asian, and want to treat me like they would if I was white, even if that means being kind of indirectly racist to me, if that makes sense. This is what makes me wonder that maybe it isn't emotional abuse? \n\nThey've fed/clothed/sheltered/generally provided for me for so long and I'm almost inclined to view it as an act of charity I need to be more thankful for or a debt I have to repay in full eventually. It's hard to think of a way to settle a debt that's been building your entire life so I think I'm just going to feel like this forever. ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I work Monday through Friday, I come home at 5 pm and I don't have time for myself\" \n\nFYI: I take care of our son Mon-Friday from 6 am to 5 pm when she gets home and I don't complain. I just feel like she's not fully aware of her responsibility as a mother and she's being selfish. She said, \"I can't have a day to myself and just be lazy\" \n\nMy thinking \" Well, last time I checked you're a mom and this is part of being responsible\" Of course, I didnt tell her that to avoid a fight, but geez....let's Mom up here!\n\nMaybe I'm missing something here?  I feel like shes trying to make me feel guilty for not being there. I know it may be tough on her working all day then coming home to a baby but I am also taking care of him every day. I just sometimes feel like she simply doesn't want to embrace motherhood. \n\nWhat do u think?\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don\u2019t specifically remember the comment, but I remember the convo moving to a point where I asked if he had considered sleeping with me. He said yes. So when I went home from my friends house that day, he made some moves on me. He always asked if \u201cI wanted it\u201d but really I had just been so excited to finally have sex in general I don\u2019t think I cared who it was with. We would text on whatever app we could. On a specific day he would stay at work late, so I would always stay up to fool around with him.\n\nWhen I got my first boyfriend (long distance) I told him I didn\u2019t want to anymore because it felt like cheating. He kept telling me that it \u201cdidn\u2019t matter\u201d because \u201che lives so far away\u201d and that since he was cheating on his wife I should cheat on my boyfriend.

I kept refusing, so he got creative. \u201cLet\u2019s just cuddle\u201d which tuned into naked cuddling. He would offer to give me a back massage and then he would rub my butt/try to finger me.

This same man attempted to crush my head with his hands, and choke me on two separate occasions in his sleep. I say this happened in his sleep because that\u2019s what he claimed- he had no recollection of it, and because the incidents happened after me asking him to push over in the middle of the night, he must have become overwhelmed with anger in his sleep.\n\nI\u2019ve had years of counselling and stages of grief and admittance I\u2019ve gone through to be able to feel comfortable enough to share this information with my current partner, let alone an online community. I\u2019m here because now I\u2019m experiencing this feeling of need for justice or for him to know what he put me through.

What do you think about this \u201cin my sleep\u201d excuse? I still doubt it sometimes because no one can deny that what he did was cruel, but is it really his fault if he was asleep? How could you not remember that?\n\n2. What would you do in my situation? Would you take legal action, contact him or his family, or just move on?\n\n3. What even are my options, if any? Do I have a choice of anything I can do to help myself feel as if someone has answered for my trauma? Or am I looking at this wrong and should instead redirect my focus on myself once again? I feel like it always comes back to me and changing my mindset. I\u2019m tired of changing. \n\nEdit: Oh yeah, he raped me, too. Forgot about that. There were a few times where he pulled himself on top of me, and I said no, covering myself with my hand(s).

I knew things were not \u201cright\u201d or \u201chealthy\u201d for a long time before, but I started dating this woman just a couple of weeks before my only son was killed in an accident. In my grief, I made a lot of excuses for how she acted \u2013 maybe I was too sensitive, maybe I wasn\u2019t seeing things that were not there, maybe she just didn\u2019t know how to deal with what I was going through\u2026 Things finally clicked with me when, during an argument, she tried to throw an alarm clock at my head \u2013 which only didn\u2019t hit me because it was still plugged to the wall. I\u2019m ashamed to say that, while I knew in that moment that I needed to leave, it took me a few weeks after that before I finally broke things off. This is someone who portrays herself as the survivor of both physical and sexual abuse, and who blames her actions on this past trauma and fear that she\u2019s not good enough. I wanted to believe that, if she could address that past trauma, things would be ok. I was wrong, mainly because she has demonstrated that she has no interest in addressing any problems. In fact, she has repeatedly stated that she believes that all the problems in our relationship were the result of me \u201cnot dealing with the grief of losing my child\u201d. \nIn the beginning of January/2019, I broke things off. Since then, she has taken upon herself to engage in some of the most bizarre behaviors that I have ever seen. She has created situations to accost me at my job, wanting to \u201ctalk about us\u201d. When I told her that I would not speak to her about us while at work, she started to create crisis situations to call me at work and ask me for help \u2013 on one incident, she called a co-worker of mine, because I was not answering her phone and, after I heard him at my office door telling her that I was on my cell phone on another call, she actually called my office line to get an answer. She went to several of my friends, and told them that the only reason I broke up with her was because I was making her the scapegoat for my grief over losing my son, and asked for them to intervene on her behalf to tell me I should take her back. She has sent me hundreds upon hundreds of messages on Facebook Messenger \u2013 not an exaggeration; I have over 400 screenshots of messages, in addition to calling and leaving voicemails. In some of those messages, she alludes to driving by my house, leaving flowers at my door, seeing that my bedroom lights were still on at 2:30 am, etc. The messages also range from telling me that I should come home, telling me that she loves me, telling me that she will change, blaming my son\u2019s death for all our problems, telling me that I lost my one true love and that I will never find anybody who loves me as much as she does, etc. I finally contacted the authorities in order to get the situation under control. At first, she lashed out in anger, saying that she was glad that my son is dead, because I don\u2019t deserve to have a child. And now she\u2019s moved on to saying that I was emotionally abusive throughout our relationship and that I\u2019m a narcissist. I know that all of it is irrational and I will never make sense of it. But the mental acrobatics that this woman has shown herself capable of and the casual relationship she seems to have with facts and the truth are just mind-blowing to me. \nPlease tell me that time takes care of this worry/stress. \n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

But, if your mother doesn\u2019t love you, and instead hates you because it\u2019s easier than facing her own guilt, is she really a mother?\u00a0 Is a father who sexually abuses you, really a father?\n\nAll of us siblings went our own separate ways as fast as we were able. Growing up together was hard.  One sister ran away.  The other was forced to care for us, cook, clean, do laundry.  It\u2019s too hard to be around each other all the time, and be reminded of the trauma.\u00a0 This isn\u2019t to say that we don\u2019t care about each other, but it\u2019s easier and less painful to practice \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d than to be close.\n\nGrandparents who opted out because of the trauma, grandparents who had already blamed their own children for the trauma they inflicted upon them.\u00a0 Are they really grandparents if they never learn to spell your name, don\u2019t call or write, don\u2019t know anything about you?\n\nAnd so many friends I could have made if I had anything in common with them.\u00a0 My peers hadn\u2019t been through what I had, and with no one to help me to understand the abuse, I had to interpret it in my own ways.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t understand they hadn\u2019t been through the same things as myself.\u00a0 I was on the outside, always looking in.  Until I started to unconsciously recognize trauma in others and be drawn to them.  Even then I still wanted to belong to the ones who hadn't lived through trauma.\n\nMoms who loved their daughters, Fathers who didn\u2019t abuse, siblings who were close, cousins as close as siblings, grandparents who took an active interest.  These things were all I wanted, but not what I had.\n\nAlways fumbling along trying to find where I belonged.  It was very lonely growing up. It can still be lonely.  I have five sisters. Four of which I never talk to.  One I can talk to, but it\u2019s not easy and I can\u2019t talk about what hurts me the most.  We text mainly at birthdays and holidays.  I try to go visit every year, can\u2019t always make it, but it\u2019s always amazing when I do.  She was always more my mom than my sister. I don\u2019t blame them, though.  I could never do that.  I really do understand. It still hurts though.  I always wanted a sister who was a best friend. \n\nI have a brother, I always wished we would be close.  We fought all the time.  I think because my mom loved him and not me. As adults we are very different.  We don\u2019t speak often, just birthdays and holidays, or when I go visit.  We don\u2019t fight now.  However, he used to interact with my social media, but not since I began blogging.  That hurts, too.  \n\nI have an amazing Aunt. I love her so very very much\u2026 but she is also \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d.  Not that we have any issues between us, and I know she loves me as well.  But when you share trauma, you see it in the people who share in it with you.  It\u2019s not easy to see each other or have close relationships.  You become each other\u2019s triggers.  Not everyone is in the same place in their healing.  It\u2019s messy.  It\u2019s hard.  It\u2019s painful.\n\nMy brother and I have three younger sisters,  they don\u2019t want to confront the truth, or be confronted with it.\u00a0 Which means a relationship is out of the question, as I will no longer pretend the abuse didn\u2019t happen.\n\nTrauma is so much more than the act.  When my dad chose to abuse us, he broke everything.  He stole our mother, our childhood, our family, our chance for unconditional love.  There is nothing I can do to heal all of us and knit us back together.  It\u2019s my lot, and I am working with what I have.  I\u2019m not giving up, or giving in.  I am realizing though just how far reaching his actions were.  \n\nMy older sisters, myself, and our younger brother we\u2019ve all gone our own way.  Started our own families, built something we never had growing up.  What we\u2019ve accomplished is truly amazing considering all we went through, all we must struggle with in our lives. \n\nHealing is hard work. There are so many complexities that I must hold simultaneously to understand how it has affected every part of my being.\u00a0 The trauma of being sexually abused by my dad, and then the trauma inflicted by my mom who pretended it didn\u2019t happen, while still actively blaming us for it.\u00a0 There is so much unraveling to be done, to weave myself back into who I am.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I can smell the liquor on his breath. He leaves and I wonder if he\u2019s supposed to touch me there. I\u2019m scared\n\nIt\u2019s nighttime. He\u2019s been drinking. He\u2019s been arguing with mom. She tries to put us to bed but he walks into the room. He wants me to say I love you. Roberts crying. I can\u2019t say it and I\u2019m scared. I can smell the liquor again. He gets angry and punches a cabinet. Mom takes us and leaves\n\nIt\u2019s a few days later. I hope we don\u2019t go back. I cry in the car. I remember begging mom to not go back. She promises things will be different. Nothing changes\n\nTime has passed. He comes into the room again when mom leaves. This time he goes further and reaches into my pants. Again he leaves and I cry. \n\nMom and him argue about me. He calls me bipolar and crazy\n\nI\u2019m 12 years old. I have the pills ready in front of me. I cry as I think about how much I want to die. I decide against it. This isn\u2019t the first time and it won\u2019t be the last time I\u2019m on the edge ready to jump\n\nMy school years almost over. I write a letter. I tell my counselor how I\u2019m done suffering. How I want to die. I leave it in a tin at the front office and ask them to give it to her. I wait for her to get it\n\nThe weekend passes. One last time he holds me too close. I\u2019m scared he knows. I call a friend and wait for my mom to get home. I wait to see if the police shows up. They never do\n\nIt\u2019s Monday. They call me into the office. They\u2019ve called the police. I\u2019m almost free\n\nI\u2019m 13 years old. I\u2019m done suffering. I\u2019ve told people. Mom says maybe I just made it up. I don\u2019t want her to be angry so I agree.\n\nI\u2019m 14 years old. I go to courts and tell them I lied. I say I want him to come home to the detective. He knows the truth. I hope maybe he\u2019ll push me a bit more and I\u2019ll tell him the truth. It never happens\n\nIm 15 years old. We move and i think maybe im actually safe. Mom says when he gets out he\u2019ll join us. I cry again\n\nMemories start coming back. I tell her the truth and she cuts contact. He stops sending letters\n\nI have nightmares still. I remember his hands on me and his face. His voice haunts me. I live everyday in fear he\u2019ll find me\n\nI\u2019m 18 years old. I find him on Facebook and every feeling comes back. I hate him. I hate how he\u2019s taken my childhood. I hate that I can\u2019t completely forget him\n\nTonight he\u2019s in my recommendations on Facebook. It\u2019s a different account. He has pictures of a teenage girl who I think is his daughter and his grandmother with a baby. Every feeling comes back again. They seem so happy. I wonder if I should find them and tell them the truth of what happened. I fear for them but mostly I fear for myself and I decide against it\n\nMaybe I won\u2019t tell them tonight but I will tell them. He won\u2019t get to live happily ever after as long as I\u2019m alive", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Well, for me, anyway.\n\nAfter I moved in, everything suddenly stopped. I was never hugged or kissed out of the blue, never physically touched at all really, even when I touched her. I passed this off as me being the man and that means I have to initiate everything and expect nothing, but man, literally anything would've done. Stroke the back of my hand, or something. Anything!\n\nIt goes without saying that sex wasn't exactly the \"wild and crazy ride\" she promised. Sex was me performing at 150%, making sure every moment was incredible for her, and getting absolutely nothing in return. After moving in, she suddenly couldn't perform oral anymore, and she forgot how to use her hands so I was never touched again after that. But I figured, I'm the guy, it's supposed to be all about the woman, right? As long as she has a great time I can feel good about that. Well, it didn't feel good at all. It got to the point where I would genuinely have given her a honeymoon experience, in exchange for the feeling of the tip of her finger running down my back.\n\nI feel kinda wrong for being hurt about this, like I'm being unreasonably selfish. I've never been with anyone else, so this is pretty much my only view on real sex: That, maybe every other guy out there gets to experience intimacy, just not me. That for me to even want to be touched is just out of the question, and I'm kidding myself.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I just want to post this in the hope that others can spot the signs sooner than I did. If it helps at least one person (maybe myself to get it off my chest) then it is worth it. I met my ex girlfriend a year ago. I wasn't immediately attracted to her but I decided to get to know her. She was a single working mother and I was impressed by the fact that she was doing it all by herself. We went on a first date where she told me a lot of sob stories: Her mum walked out on the family when she was a teenager, the father of her child wanted nothing to do with raising the child, her previous boyfriend had hit her. I was taken in by the fact that despite all this she seemed to be doing ok. I was impressed. We continued to date and it seemed perfect. She was caring, affectionate. She told me that she had accepted she was going to be alone for the rest of her life until I came along and how I wasn't like any of the other men she had dated. I was flattered and was starting to fall in love. There were a few red flags.. All her ex's were jerks according to her. She told me she got bored easily and that if I was out of sight I would be out of her mind. She didn't have a good word for one of them. She described herself as a bit of a loner with few friends. She also didn't seem to have good relationships with any of her immediate family bar 1 or 2. She had a very strong victim mentality. 6 weeks into dating I went to a music festival without her. I told her I would likely not be in contact for a few days. I cane back and she was upset that I hadn't called and asked had I cheated on her. I told her I would never do that and hadn't given her any reason to think that. Asides from that however things were generally ok. She did pressure me to meet her son early and also spend more time with her but I was spending 2-3 days and nights a week with her which is what free time I had. I told her I wanted to wait a little longer that 3 months before meeting her son. During this time I noticed that she didn't want to meet my family or friends and felt uncomfortable around the few friends she did agree to meet. She always had a reason though. She also started making some hurtful comments and joked how she was in control in the relationship. At this point I took these as jokes and laughed them off. Then we went on holiday together. I think this brought out the worst in her because she was no longer in control as such. She became angry and abusive, hitting me with insults and also being very passive aggressive. She was also talking meanly about people she didnt even know like people in front of her in a que. I asked her what I had done wrong and she broke down crying and said \"I can't do this anymore\" We came home and I wrote her a letter telling her how much I loved her. She seemed to come around again. Her apology consisted of \"If I was you I would have left me at the airport. Sorry\" I had hoped she would understand the pain she put me through but I accepted what she said and said I wanted to move on. The next day I texted her and asked if she was feeling better about things. She totally blew up at me, claiming that we had talked about this last night and asking why I was bringing it up again. I had litrerally just asked \"Are you feeling better about things?\" I started to see more of her anger.  She would project this onto me saying that I was in a bad mood and that was what caused her to get angry. I was so confused and apologising all the time for stuff I didn't even understand. At thus point we were 5 months in and I though maybe I needed to meet her son, maybe she thinks I am not fully commited to her. I met her son and we bonded so well. She seemed happy again but it didn't last. The angry outbursts came back and she would pick arguments and then blame me for defending myself in them. She also told me on numerous occasions \"You don't do what you are told!!\"  She seemed to take pleasure in this. Around this time I went out with my friends one Saturday night and had too much to drink. I went home to my own house to sleep it off. We had loosely arranged to meet on the Sunday but I slept in due to the hangover and didn't text her until 5pm that day. I really regretted my actions and told her I was so sorry. She was furious at me. She told me \"I want to hurt you like you hurt me.\" I accepted fully responsibility and begged her to forgive me. She then told me \"I'm not going to tell my son you are coming over anymore because it only upsets him when you don't!!!\" I understood her anger but it felt like the punishment didn't fit the crime. This was the one and only time this ever happened. She got more angry and started to slam doors etc. I was totally walking on eggshells at this point trying to not saying anything that would cause her to blow up. She would look at me with resentful looks even though I'd said and done nothing. Sex was also withdrawn unless I'd proved how much I loved her and my dedication to her. Also she now asked had I cheated on her anytime I went away on a business trip or away with friends. At this point I started to question the fast that I wasn't getting any of the affection I was giving. I asked her about this and she said \"I'm just not an affectionate person, never have been.. if that is what you need then maybe I can't be that girlfriend.\" I was shocked as this was not the girl I fell in love with... I didn't recognise this person. I also noticed she would be nice In public or on the phone but then would turn on me In private. In the final weeks before she dumped me she got really bad. She started critising how I performed in bed even though in the early days she was all over me. Again I could see that she got amusment from this. At this point I was broken. I had stopped fighting back and was a shell of my former self.  At the time she discarded me saying that she didn't like who she had become and wanted to be alone. The next time we met I told that she should like herself because I though she was a good person, she replied that she hadn't really meant that statement but she realised she had got \"a bit snappy.\" She also told me that she knew she was crazy but that I knew what I was getting into so I was to blame (She previously told me that she had depression but was not taking the medication anymore because she didn't want to be medicated.) She didnt seem to have any emotion. It was like I was a used tissue and was now worth nothing to her. She brought up things I had said and twisting everything in the most negative light. I was shocked. I told her\"Do you realise that you hurt me too? I described some times but she said she couldn't remember any of those events at all! She didn't Hoover me but did send an angry text about 1 month later as I had talked to a mutual friend about the breakup. I told the friend that I was confused as her reasons seemed vague and that I was hurt. That was it. I also wished My ex well. My ex told me that I was making up different versions of what happened and that I wasn't to talk to anyone about the relationship.\n\nSo what do you guys think? Is this covert narcissism. It seems to tick a lot of boxes for me.. I was very damaged after this relationship but have worked hard to get myself back. All this happened in 9 months so I guess I got off light. I would love to hear other people thoughts and perspectives on this. \n\nThe worst is that I want her back in my life for some reason. I know I deserve better than this but I think it might be trauma bonding. It's been nearly four months and I'll still think about her everyday. I swing between saying she is abusive, to \"maybe she was just in a relationship that wasn't working\" to \"maybe I was at fault for all these things.\" It's amazing the shifts I have in my mind. I believe she is casually dating again. She was 6 weeks after the breakup. I tried to reach out but it's like I am nothing to her now. Not even worth a text...\n\nI know I wasn't perfect in the relationship. I could have tried to give more time to her. I could have met my friends less and focused on her more but I felt at the end like I gave it everything I had. I will miss the good times but there were a lot of lows too..", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Suddenly all the puzzles started to make sense. The way he was at the start of the relationship and then the way he changed suddenly. \n\nI used to be unhappy at least 80% of the time we were together and that is not an exaggeration. From then on i continuously read a lot about narcissism while also talking to him normally. A lot of his tricks and manipulation were picked on by me as soon as he was doing it. And i realised slowly that he is pathetic. Let me not get into the details of it. \n\nAfter that i really could not think of a life with him. And i wanted out. He just didnt feel like that person anymore. I started realising a lot of stuff about myself too. I never used to question why i went along with his emotional abuse or how i was gaslighted every time. But this study brought some self awareness this time. \n\nI would take a stand now every time he tried bullshitting his way through. It was his trick apparently to \u2018either convince them or confuse them\u2019, he only spoke about using it on others but i realised how often he did it to me too. \n\nI contemplated of telling him what i think he is (narcissist) but then i could literally predict how the conversation would go and decided not to. \n\nI decided to end it by saying i cannot do this anymore and that it is getting too much for me. But he would convince me to stay, even though my mind was made, i couldnt see this guy as a father of our future kids anymore. \n\nAnother slip up, another time i would say it is over. He would convince me i am being overly emotional and i would literally feel like i am too much for him. So I would tell him maybe we look at life in different ways but again he would convince me. This one time he pulled a stunt of attempting to suicide. I had panicked and stayed. \n\nFew days later, i had it with his nonsense and tried to end it. Now i am not sure if this was the final time but it must have been. \nI felt free and happy that he is gone. \n\nThen i found the subreddit bpdlovedones and some of the symptoms they would state felt like me when i was trying to end it. I had this panic attack where i would try and search more about bpd and see if that is me, wondering if i had been wrong about him. \n\nAnd now when i read other people\u2019s stories here on this subreddit, they are just so relatable i feel like i am at home so hence my question;\n\nTl;dr does narcissistic abuse bring out borderline symptoms?

{"post_id": "b2ijst", "created_utc": 1552914598, "title": "Recent Break Up with Narcissist Ex/Abuse Recovery", "author": "JonnyRose22x", "self_text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m new here and only discovered I\u2019m an HSP last night. I\u2019m a 23 year old, Bisexual male who just got out of a 6 month relationship with a full blown narcissist (31 year old male). I\u2019m on a self discovery and healing journey that I\u2019ve only just begun. \n\nFrom the beginning, it seemed we were meant to be. This new person in my life magically possessed all of the same values I did. He was so innocent, kind, positive and inspiring. Things were great for about 2 months (thanks to my emotions blinding me/honeymoon phase) the only thing I quickly picked up as an issue was his extreme difficulty in expressing his feelings and just being open/honest about them (but only when the conversation became serious between us). He would just shut down and be next to impossible to talk to. Inevitably, instead of working with me to resolve anything, he would somehow (sometimes right away or even hours/days later) make me feel bad for even bringing it up and become a victim. Despite this clear lack of emotional intelligence, he was incredibly good with interaction and expression with anyone else (I believe a developed skill by his evident, extreme need for constant admiration and attention). He\u2019s attractive, charming and very outwardly positive (although it\u2019s a fa\u00e7ade) so it\u2019s rather effortless for him to get the attention he so desperately craves. Everyone loves him, at work, people who meet him... everyone.... but they don\u2019t really know him (although I\u2019m sure they think they do). He doesn\u2019t have any real relationships and no friends he talks to on a consistent basis, let alone goes out to meet. He told me once he doesn\u2019t \u201chave time\u201d for friends, only a \u201cpartner\u201d aka boyfriend (he didn\u2019t like \u201cboyfriend\u201d though, said he felt it to be less meaningful). He was a very routine person, and hated it when something got in the way of his schedule (regardless of its importance). He would be incredibly sensitive to the slightest discomfort or even possibility of discomfort. It was game over if he felt any at all. He broadcasted \u201cpositivity\u201d constantly, and almost never got upset. It was like he was living in this false world of constant happiness and when a serious problem or event came up that threatened it, he\u2019d cast it away so as to not disturb his candy land.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after the two month mark that this gut feeling crept in... something was very wrong. I didn\u2019t know what it was though, I couldn\u2019t see any concrete evidence of him doing anything wrong. After paying closer attention (or maybe just paying attention) I began to notice that his expression of emotion never seemed genuine or something. Several times it was so obvious to me that I even flat out told him he seemed insincere (which seemed to upset him). It felt like he was acting and the idea of that began to creep me out. Anyway, This gut feeling led to massive suspicion, followed by extreme paranoia. He would emotionally abuse me with the silent treatment, passing it off as needing time to \u201cprocess his feelings\u201d. This happened after any serious discussion (which just became increasingly frequent given his inability to actually help resolve anything). The withdrawal of attention would also coincidentally end with me reaching out to him, expressing concern and trying my hardest (despite how clearly right I may have been) to see how he could be right and suggest that perhaps, I didn\u2019t consider his thoughts carefully enough (I know now that was a brutal mistake). \n\nHe gaslighted me constantly, every day. This psychological/emotional abuse combined with my paranoia and suspicions led my mind to a very chaotic state. As time went on, his mask would slip more and more. Despite how incredibly good I am at listening (and clearly exhibited this at the beginning of the relationship) I was at a point where I could no longer really listen to him or remember things he said. All I could do when he talked was analyze everything bout him... his words, his tone, his face, his body movements. Almost every time he spoke I was thinking \u201cHow does this prove he\u2019s up to something?\u201d Anyway, we were going to move in together (signed a lease and everything). Despite how clearly fucked up this all sounds, I could easily allow the things he went through in his past to explain why he was this way and try to see the good. I was also doubting my mind and wondering how much of the problem was me and my thoughts. If I was the problem (or most of it), then he really was just a great, charming guy who had an issue expressing his feelings. Yea... no\n\nTwo weeks before we were set to move in, my mind is completely messed up. I\u2019m hardly eating, sometimes pulling all nighters trying to look into things and uncover evidence. I became obsessed with trying to obtain irrefutable proof that he was up to something so that I could just end the relationship with peace of mind (well, proof he was garbage, the peace of mind is still on its way lol). I ended up discovering that he had a second phone and was hiding it in his work locker. It was the exact same model and colour phone as the one he always had around me. (Unsurprisingly that wouldn\u2019t make anyone suspicious seeing it, cause they\u2019d think they\u2019re the same phone). Anyway, I brought up what I knew when he noticed I was acting weird (funny, he always seemed so oblivious to my emotions). When I showed him the painfully obvious proof, he just flat out denied it and played dumb \u201cwhat am I looking at, I don\u2019t get it\u201d. Anyway I removed that trash (him) from my life two weeks ago but am still left with a recovery ahead. I\u2019m now severely depressed (I\u2019ve been on and off SSRIs for depression a couple times in my life but am off them now). I\u2019m also taking Vyvanse for my ADD (diagnosed last summer). If I don\u2019t take the Vyvanse, I just feel like shit all day. If I do take it, I have a good portion of the day where I feel good (sometimes even great) but then get these annoying mood swings from \u201cI can accomplish anything I set my mind to\u201d and envisioning success with my talents/skills etc... to depressed and literally zero motivation or desire to do anything.\n\nI talked to my Doctor and she wants me to wait a month to remove this breakup (and its contribution of emotional disturbance) from the equation, to isolate what the medication is really doing. The issue is, I\u2019m in school and not stable at all. I\u2019ve NEVER been in this state before (I\u2019ve always dealt with some self-confidence/esteem issues but my mind has never been this debilitated). I\u2019ve gotten better already since leaving him but my schooling tanked hard through the tail end of the relationship and still is. I\u2019m trying to turn things around but am finding it very difficult with these mood swings and essentially zero motivation. \n\nThis relationship was so weird because he contributed real effort on many occasions, but I think it was just enough to keep me hooked. My point is, it wasn\u2019t all bad. It\u2019s not like he just flat out used me and never contributed in anyway because financially, things were pretty even and fair. The main issues were his severe lack of consistent contribution to the relationship and that I never truly felt loved. I was starved of emotion from this counterfeit person and who never had any interest in really investing anything into the relationship. My god was he ever good at the art of deception, but certain things just didn\u2019t fool me. (Were just obviously too inconsistent) and it kept me in the paranoia. Despite him cuddling me (like a stone) and saying he loved me, the actions and genuine emotions simply weren\u2019t there to back it up.\n\nI\u2019m well aware that this post is very long, disconnected and simply not crafted anywhere near the level that I\u2019d ordinarily be capable of.  My mind is still in a whirlwind and I\u2019m struggling to get out. I realize it\u2019s only been two weeks but I\u2019d very much appreciate any tips or suggestions to help me on my path of recovery (I\u2019ve been to counselling twice now at my college and will continue to go once a week).

{"post_id": "b2ip3s", "created_utc": 1552915447, "title": "My Story/Seeking Guidance", "author": "JonnyRose22x", "self_text": "Hey guys, I\u2019m new here and only discovered I\u2019m an HSP last night. I\u2019m a 23 year old, Bisexual male who just got out of a 6 month relationship with a full blown narcissist (31 year old male). I\u2019m on a self discovery and healing journey that I\u2019ve only just begun. \n\nFrom the beginning, it seemed we were meant to be. This new person in my life magically possessed all of the same values I did. He was so innocent, kind, positive and inspiring. Things were great for about 2 months (thanks to my emotions blinding me/honeymoon phase) the only thing I quickly picked up as an issue was his extreme difficulty in expressing his feelings and just being open/honest about them (but only when the conversation became serious between us). He would just shut down and be next to impossible to talk to. Inevitably, instead of working with me to resolve anything, he would somehow (sometimes right away or even hours/days later) make me feel bad for even bringing it up and become a victim. Despite this clear lack of emotional intelligence, he was incredibly good with interaction and expression with anyone else (I believe a developed skill by his evident, extreme need for constant admiration and attention). He\u2019s attractive, charming and very outwardly positive (although it\u2019s a fa\u00e7ade) so it\u2019s rather effortless for him to get the attention he so desperately craves. Everyone loves him, at work, people who meet him... everyone.... but they don\u2019t really know him (although I\u2019m sure they think they do). He doesn\u2019t have any real relationships and no friends he talks to on a consistent basis, let alone goes out to meet. He told me once he doesn\u2019t \u201chave time\u201d for friends, only a \u201cpartner\u201d aka boyfriend (he didn\u2019t like \u201cboyfriend\u201d though, said he felt it to be less meaningful). He was a very routine person, and hated it when something got in the way of his schedule (regardless of its importance). He would be incredibly sensitive to the slightest discomfort or even possibility of discomfort. It was game over if he felt any at all. He broadcasted \u201cpositivity\u201d constantly, and almost never got upset. It was like he was living in this false world of constant happiness and when a serious problem or event came up that threatened it, he\u2019d cast it away so as to not disturb his candy land.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after the two month mark that this gut feeling crept in... something was very wrong. I didn\u2019t know what it was though, I couldn\u2019t see any concrete evidence of him doing anything wrong. After paying closer attention (or maybe just paying attention) I began to notice that his expression of emotion never seemed genuine or something. Several times it was so obvious to me that I even flat out told him he seemed insincere (which seemed to upset him). It felt like he was acting and the idea of that began to creep me out. Anyway, This gut feeling led to massive suspicion, followed by extreme paranoia. He would emotionally abuse me with the silent treatment, passing it off as needing time to \u201cprocess his feelings\u201d. This happened after any serious discussion (which just became increasingly frequent given his inability to actually help resolve anything). The withdrawal of attention would also coincidentally end with me reaching out to him, expressing concern and trying my hardest (despite how clearly right I may have been) to see how he could be right and suggest that perhaps, I didn\u2019t consider his thoughts carefully enough (I know now that was a brutal mistake). \n\nHe gaslighted me constantly, every day. This psychological/emotional abuse combined with my paranoia and suspicions led my mind to a very chaotic state. As time went on, his mask would slip more and more. Despite how incredibly good I am at listening (and clearly exhibited this at the beginning of the relationship) I was at a point where I could no longer really listen to him or remember things he said. All I could do when he talked was analyze everything bout him... his words, his tone, his face, his body movements. Almost every time he spoke I was thinking \u201cHow does this prove he\u2019s up to something?\u201d Anyway, we were going to move in together (signed a lease and everything). Despite how clearly fucked up this all sounds, I could easily allow the things he went through in his past to explain why he was this way and try to see the good. I was also doubting my mind and wondering how much of the problem was me and my thoughts. If I was the problem (or most of it), then he really was just a great, charming guy who had an issue expressing his feelings. Yea... no\n\nTwo weeks before we were set to move in, my mind is completely messed up. I\u2019m hardly eating, sometimes pulling all nighters trying to look into things and uncover evidence. I became obsessed with trying to obtain irrefutable proof that he was up to something so that I could just end the relationship with peace of mind (well, proof he was garbage, the peace of mind is still on its way lol). I ended up discovering that he had a second phone and was hiding it in his work locker. It was the exact same model and colour phone as the one he always had around me. (Unsurprisingly that wouldn\u2019t make anyone suspicious seeing it, cause they\u2019d think they\u2019re the same phone). Anyway, I brought up what I knew when he noticed I was acting weird (funny, he always seemed so oblivious to my emotions). When I showed him the painfully obvious proof, he just flat out denied it and played dumb \u201cwhat am I looking at, I don\u2019t get it\u201d. Anyway I removed that trash (him) from my life two weeks ago but am still left with a recovery ahead. I\u2019m now severely depressed (I\u2019ve been on and off SSRIs for depression a couple times in my life but am off them now). I\u2019m also taking Vyvanse for my ADD (diagnosed last summer). If I don\u2019t take the Vyvanse, I just feel like shit all day. If I do take it, I have a good portion of the day where I feel good (sometimes even great) but then get these annoying mood swings from \u201cI can accomplish anything I set my mind to\u201d and envisioning success with my talents/skills etc... to depressed and literally zero motivation or desire to do anything.\n\nI talked to my Doctor and she wants me to wait a month to remove this breakup (and its contribution of emotional disturbance) from the equation, to isolate what the medication is really doing. The issue is, I\u2019m in school and not stable at all. I\u2019ve NEVER been in this state before (I\u2019ve always dealt with some self-confidence/esteem issues but my mind has never been this debilitated). I\u2019ve gotten better already since leaving him but my schooling tanked hard through the tail end of the relationship and still is. I\u2019m trying to turn things around but am finding it very difficult with these mood swings and essentially zero motivation. \n\nThis relationship was so weird because he contributed real effort on many occasions, but I think it was just enough to keep me hooked. My point is, it wasn\u2019t all bad. It\u2019s not like he just flat out used me and never contributed in anyway because financially, things were pretty even and fair. The main issues were his severe lack of consistent contribution to the relationship and that I never truly felt loved. I was starved of emotion from this counterfeit person and who never had any interest in really investing anything into the relationship. My god was he ever good at the art of deception, but certain things just didn\u2019t fool me. (Were just obviously too inconsistent) and it kept me in the paranoia. Despite him cuddling me (like a stone) and saying he loved me, the actions and genuine emotions simply weren\u2019t there to back it up.\n\nI\u2019m well aware that this post is very long, disconnected and simply not crafted anywhere near the level that I\u2019d ordinarily be capable of.  My mind is still in a whirlwind and I\u2019m struggling to get out. I realize it\u2019s only been two weeks but I\u2019d very much appreciate any tips or suggestions to help me on my path of recovery (I\u2019ve been to counselling twice now at my college and will continue to go once a week).

He would turn TURN OFF his phone and not be contactable. Either that or he would outright ignore me all night. For up to or sometimes upwards of a day at a time.\n\nHis sleeping patterns also happened to be all over the shop... sometimes all day, sometimes all night, sometimes both.\n\nThe thing is, he had got me so guilty, anxious, feeling like such a terrible person for ever questioning him, and he had made it clear that he would discard me at the drop of a hat without a moment's notice should I even try, and that he didn't give a fuck, that I just accepted it. Like, I KNEW he was full of bullshit but I would never leave. I was trauma bonded to the extreme.\n\nI somehow forced myself to believe (okay I don't think I did really), that this guy was sleeping for 24 hours at a time. Sometimes more. And that nothing shady was going on.\n\nI even tried to rationalise it with my behaviour, like, \"maybe I'd sleep that long if I was that tired...\"\n\nI was barely even a side piece at that point.\n\nI just really, really didn't want to lose him.

But if I brought that up, I'd get told \"well if you think I'm so shady then just leave if I'm so awful\". So instead I hung on for the magical couple of texts I would (sometimes) get on his return. Lucky me... if I got a phone call in those months it was like I'd been given a million dollars that was how grateful I was.\n\nReality is, I just wanted to believe his excuses.

With that said, how worried should I be?", "author": "Living4theWeekend", "self_text": "I\u2019ve lurked around for a while, and I\u2019ve been thinking that my (M24) wife (F21) displays some narcissistic tendencies, but I\u2019ve felt that I\u2019m too close to the situation to really tell. I know that one situation really won\u2019t be a complete representation, but this has really hurt me and I need to talk about it. I\u2019ve never believed that my wife could actually be a narcissist that doesn\u2019t care if she hurts me, but that somewhat changed this past Saturday and Sunday (yesterday).\n\nFor some background, we started dating when she was 16 and I was 19. I was her first and only everything, and we lost our virginity to each other. I was first attracted to her because she didn\u2019t act like a 16 year old kid. She was funny, responsible, and seemed mature, at least in most things. Out told the blue she would find something to be angry about , and often throw a sort of tantrum about how awful it was. I thought she would grow out of it. We\u2019ve been married for almost a year now.\n\nSaturday started as a fairly normal Saturday. We had originally planned that I would go with my cousin to help him move a piano (his occupation) which started at 1 pm, then I would meet her halfway back to our place and she and I would go visit her parents and our niece and nephew for a few hours. The piano move did not go as planned. Basically, there was miscommunication, and we didn\u2019t have the equipment we needed to actually move the thing, so it didn\u2019t happen . That wasn\u2019t decided until 2 pm.\n\nOne of the other people that was going to help with the move is a good friend that I hadn\u2019t seen in several months. So, naturally, when my cousin and good friend wanted to take the opportunity for us to all hang out for a bit, I was excited, but nervous about my wife. So, I called her to let her know the move didn\u2019t happen, and the guys wanted to hang out for a while, I know she doesn\u2019t like when the plans change, so what would she like for me to do?\n\nI could tell her tone was weird, but I couldn\u2019t quite place what it was. She said she knows that I don\u2019t get to see them often, and I should take advantage of the opportunity. Just let her know what we were doing and such. I was now very excited to just sit and talk with these guys again. But I felt like shit, I had a ball of dread in my stomach the entire drive to lunch, but I just kept trying to push it out, convincing myself that I was just freaking out. I was not.\n\nShe spends the afternoon at her parent\u2019s house, visiting with them and her oldest sister and BIL came to visit for a while. Just before we eat dinner with my father at our house, she finds out that her other sister and BIL made it her parent\u2019s house to collect their kids, but then everyone decided to stay at MIL and DIL\u2019s house for dinner (Wife hated to go to bed as a child, thought she\u2019d miss something or be left out, so this was basically one of her worst nightmares).\n\nAfter it\u2019s just the two of us that evening, she virtually has a melt down. She says that every one of my family members is shit, and yet we make time for them, but never see her family (my family has issues, most of which is agree with her on, and yes, we do end up seeing my family more). She says she\u2019s not angry at me for spending time with my friends, it\u2019s just that the timing really sucked and pissed her off. She also says that if we had something planned with my family, I never would have done it (changed the plan and bailed on family). She\u2019s shaking with anger at this point.\n\nUsually, in situations like that, I get a bit angry and fight back. That night, I was totally deflated. All I felt was an overwhelming sense of, you were right, she was going to be mad, of course she was, you can\u2019t do anything right, you always screw things up. I had no fight in me at all, it was all just gone. I knew she was angry enough that just about anything I said could make it it worse, so I told her I didn\u2019t know what I should say. And that made it worse. We went to bed that night and didn\u2019t cuddle (which we do on every normal night), and she repeatedly sighed deeply, a sign she\u2019s very angry. I asked what was wrong, and she replied with, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say.\u201d Again, most times I would be angry at her using such a juvenile tactic, but that night I had nothing left to fight with, so I turned away and sank lower into myself.\n\nSunday morning was mostly silent as we got ready for church. It culminated, however, with her almost screaming, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to go anywhere with you right now.\u201d I tried to be calm and reminded her that it was time to go if we were going. So, we went to church with her parents, and of course our niece and nephew. Things were rather heated during the car ride, intermixed with stone cold silence. Then, after and hour of sitting and playing with our niece especially, she was fine. She was happy, and smiling, and joking, and thought everything should be fine.\n\nWe went back to her parent\u2019s for lunch, and her mom even asked if I was alright once she was out of the room. I was still so exhausted from my lack of sleep and the dizzying shift of my wife\u2019s mood that I could only reply that I\u2019m fine, just tired. My wife even joked that she needed to get back in my good side with chocolate cause she had been grumpy. She then wanted to hold me in her lap so I could nap yesterday afternoon.\n\nUp until this point, I had explained away all of her actions as just her being stressed, or that she just needed to grow up a little more. After the last two days, however, it seems like the cycle is very apparent. Her love bombing lasts a long while (usually) but once it\u2019s done, god it goes to shit quickly.\n\nI know this was really long and rambling, but I just feel like I\u2019m crazy.

The relationship had a lot of ups and downs and ultimately it ended with him getting back together, and marrying, his ex girlfriend. I moved on and he resented me for it for a very long time.\n\nAfter the breakup, he started spreading nasty rumors about me to mutual friends and some of my family members. We live in a very small Christain town in the Bible belt, so you know how that goes. It became hard to go to church with people hearing what happened between us; there were rumors it was an affair, he got me pregnant and I had an abortion, I was a gold-digger, I was a two faced bitch, etc. None of these were true.\n\nI really worked on myself during that period and sought out therapy. I ignored the comments and didn't bring him up if someone else brought the topic up in conversation. If I saw him at church he would show off flirting with other women and parade them around in front of me, or strike up conversations with me (that I would grey-rock) and tell me how amazing his life was.\n\nLast year, I just had enough of it and blocked him everywhere. I stopped going to church and found another one with nicer people. I cut off toxic friends and grey-rocked anyone else I had to keep in my life who interacted with him. He left me alone, didn't text me or try to find me on social media, and that was that.\n\nA few months ago, he ended up being at the bar I was at with friends and we chatted for a little while. He seemed a lot nicer and relatively normal towards me. I figured he had grown up and worked on himself and seemed to be in a better spot mentally. I decided to unblock him and be cordial. I didn't want to keep hate in my heart.\n\nWell, two weeks ago it got really weird. We were out at the bar again and I'm not drinking because I'm 8 weeks pregnant. He was there, without his wife, but was constantly at my side all night. He had seen me and immediately gave me a hug, kept leaning in to talk to me and touch me, asked me a lot about what my life has been like, and generally didn't leave me side even when I tried to walk around and see other friends. He asked me if we (and some other mutual friends) could all go out soon together.\n\nHe wasn't like that towards anyone else. I don't know what my next move should be.

We are both married and live in different states but I would be lying if I said there wasn\u2019t a deeper emotional connection there. Well, that\u2019s actually the traumatic part but I guess that serves me right. We have only ever called and texted but at times it was very flirty and just to be completely transparent I liked the way that felt. I have been married 11yrs and it felt good to have that extra emotional attention. Also this person has been my best friend since I was 13. So there is a lot of connection happening there. My husband knows we talk and didn\u2019t love it but he works a lot and I am so introverted and closed off he was honestly relieved I had a friend to talk to. Again, this person lives far away and there has never been physical contact of any kind. I knew he was lying to his wife, well keeping this a secret rather and several months ago she found out and he suffered what I would believe as an emotional breakdown. Attempted suicide and all. This of course is going off his account and not my own witness because I am not at all involved in his life or close enough logistically to know what\u2019s real. Prior to the breakdown though there was heavy fighting between us. He is a narcissist, without a doubt, he is emotionally abusive and I was just so blind to all of it. I was so easily manipulated for a year, I went and sought therapy and medication bc he had me convinced something was wrong with me. I was too sensitive, too reactive. And honestly I am both, I am ADHD and much better now that I am medicated, but that is def a reason why his manipulation  was keeping me in a toxic cycle. I am easy to confuse and manipulate. So fast forward to now and I am at the point of no contact. I\u2019m not confused and I\u2019ve never been more sure of anything in my life. After many attempts to help him and speak with him daily I have concluded that his manipulation tactics are much more advanced than I recently thought. So here is my question. I know he is suicidal. He has had that tendency since I\u2019ve known him (all 18yrs) I know he has tried multiple times. I have tried to get him to seek a therapist and he says he will and he wants to but it\u2019s always a bad time. Any time we argue heavily he uses the suicide attempts as a way to scare me or make me forgive him or feel sad for him. I need to know if I am obligated to tell his wife his situation mentally. Mind you, this will not come easy as she probably has been manipulated herself and she has no idea that he has continued to talk to me. So he will have to answer for that which scares me bc of the suicide attempt last time. If any contact is made to her I am well aware it has to be \ud83d\udcaf honest and sensitive and not at all accusatory. My intent is only to help him and honestly help her if she is stuck in this situation where he lies and manipulates. Am I at all obligated to do that or can I walk away without it? I have a fear of going no contact and finding out years later he went thru with a suicide bc he never got the help he needed. I also have a fear of forcing him to confront his wife and losing control. I also have a fear that she is in an abusive situation and maybe able to get help with him that she wouldn\u2019t otherwise seek without my input. I honestly am lost. As much as I am done with this person I also really care about his well-being and the well-being of his family. He has two little children and I don\u2019t want to cause pain to anyone by sticking my nose in. It\u2019s just the suicide and manipulation tactics that I find extremely concerning. What do you think? Am I obligated to tell or do I just walk away?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I cringe for her friends who had no idea she was so crazy. 10 min Before she assaulted me, I had just met a friend of hers who literally praised me. We were the perfect couple in his eyes and I was the perfect man. Everyone knew how great I was and how I devoted my life to her happiness. Thinking about this makes me sick and oh so sad. People saying congratulations one moment and then this..\n\n10 min later, she punched me. I disagreed with something and she felt offended. She had slapped me many times before, but this time, she closed fist punched me. To me, this isn't like a slap.  Hitting me with a closed fist is intent to hurt me as much as possible, not just losing control or spur of the moment type of thing.

This was the lowest point of my life. Im so ashamed and embarassed.\n\nI am a male, and at first I was ashamed to report it. I reported the punch because I wanted my GF to finally know that enough is enough. She begged me to just brush it off and just go back home with her. It almost worked, I called the police and hung up. They called me back. Thinking I would merely explain to them that nothing was wrong and that I would handle it myself, they recognized that I was a classic case, trying to protect my abuser.

Ok, I didn\u2019t talk to him or anything so there\u2019s that. \n\nI got triggered today about the other girls and the insecurity and I was feeling upset. So I relapsed to hurt myself some more. I went back through our messages. \n\nI decided I would do the one thing I have never done all these years... and delete our messages from - the lovebombing phase. The first few months. \n\nBut then \u201cnostalgia\u201d hit me and I read all of them. \n\nBAD IDEA. Omg reading those messages was like, ughhhh whyyy?? Freaking perfection and gorgeousness and it actually made me feel comforted and good just to read them. Like I got a fucking mini high from it. Omg no one will EVER have the way with words he did. \n\nHonestly that shit is like... dreamy. IT FELT GOOD and also awful. \n\nAnd suddenly I was like, god I want him. I miss him. I love him. Urghhhh just the texts on the screen have made me crave him so badly \ud83d\ude2d\n\nBut that\u2019s not the worst thing. These messages were from around three years ago.

Maybe it would all be perfect??\n\nI know logically it\u2019s useless because\na) I tried being quiet. It didn\u2019t work.

We are not friends anymore. But was it really an abusive friendship? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have written in the Survivors' Forum before, but in regards to my Dad. However, I now believe I am in an abuse friendship, but I am not sure if this is possible? Can friends be 'abusive' like parents or partners can?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce I have begun to understand my situation I would like to write an anonymous article about my experiences in my student newspaper. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been friends with a girl (let's call her A) for about a year.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe met in a play at university that we were cast in together and became incredibly close very quickly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter rehearsals, we would get drinks and talk about the most intimate details of our lives. She would speak about her family's financial issues and I would open about my abusive relationship with my Dad. It worked both ways. I would comfort her, she would comfort me. And during these dinner dates, we would feel a sense of catharsis. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThroughout the summer we spoke a lot on social media, as we didn't live in the same part of the country. When we got back to university we spent almost every day together. She would usually ask to come to my house for dinner. We would make a tasty meal and drink expensive wine. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n'A' told me about how she would fly first class, her parents only drank fancy wine, and they owned a Tesla. I would tell her about my family's rich past. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, when we were around other people, she would start making fun of the things I had told her in confidence. She would mock the fact that I had gone to private school. She would laugh and so would everyone. I brought this up with her but she made me feel bad, saying I had made fun of myself in the past about this and she was just laughing with me, after all, 'I knew it was a joke'. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe had started dating a guy almost at the same time we had become friends. However, this guy had been my best friend up until that point and then stopped speaking to me when they got together. At first, I thought this was just a coincidence. We had grown apart, that was it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhenever I asked her if she could speak to him about it, because he wouldn't speak to me, she would get annoyed, saying that it was none of her business because he and I were friends before she got together with him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI, therefore, lost all the friends I had when I was friends with him because he lived with them. I was cut off. She spent lots of time with that group. She slipped in, I slipped out. She was my only communication with my old friends. But I tried not to make it weird. I tried not to speak about them. But we would get drunk and she would bost about the great times they had had the other day together, or show me pictures of them on her Instagram. I never appeared on her Instagram, and yet I was with her every, single, day. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhenever I asked to take an Instagram story of us together she would tell me 'I look really bad today, please don't get me in the picture'. And yet, the next day, when she was with her other friends (my old friends) she would post pictures of them all together having fun. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhenever I went to pick her up at her house, she wouldn't invite me in. She would run out and we would leave. The one day we did decide to study at her house, I asked her if I could make a cup of tea in her kitchen and she told me not to because her flatmates were in the kitchen. So, she made the tea for me. I thought this was odd - was she embarrassed for her flatmates to meet me? So, later I went into the kitchen to test this idea. I got myself a glass of water and she followed after me. Her flatmate was in there and I started a friendly conversation. All went fine. But the whole time, 'A' was standing at the other side of the room giving me weird looks, and occasionally would chip in snide remarks about me to put me down in front of her flatmate. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce we had an argument outside a pub because she had told me I needed to learn to 'adjust'. She said her dad had taught her this and she had always thought it very important. I didn't understand what she meant. She went on to explain that I should adjust who I was according to the situation I was in. I told her of course I did that! Yes, I am bubbly and outgoing, but when I am with my boyfriend's grandparents, for example, of course, I quieten down a little. But she meant more than that. She meant I should CHANGE who I fundamentally was depending on the circumstance. I thought this an awful way to live, and so we had to agree to disagree. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEffectively, throughout the friendship, she would tell me what I should and should not wear, what wine to drink, how to do my make-up, who to be friends with, and if I was to meet her parents, I would have to 'adjust' myself, otherwise they would not take to me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was honestly sick of her not accepting the person I was. I kept thinking she was doing it to help me, but it really just made me feel like she didn't like me for who I was. I was her doll. She wanted to make me into someone she wanted me to be. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last straw happened one evening when I had ASKED HER if I could meet her boyfriend to resolve our issues. I had wanted to do this so that we could all hang out and be friends. I hoped this would reduce the strain on my friendship with 'A'. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI met up with her boyfriend ('B') and we had a great time. It was like nothing bad had happened between us. We could be friends again! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was set to meet 'A' after drinks with 'B'. We were going to go to a play, then dinner, then the pub, before I would leave her to go clubbing with some friends. I had invited her clubbing but she had said she would be too tired and wanted to go home. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks earlier 'A' had introduced me to her friend 'C'. They did the same course at university and I 'C' wanted to interview me for a film she was making. I then met 'C' a few more times to make some more films. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to hang out with 'A' and 'C' at the pub. I introduced 'C' and she was excited. We were going to go clubbing after meeting 'A' at the pub. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI texted 'A' to tell her about the plans I had made with 'C' and I recieved a flurry of confused messages back. At first she asked 'Why?' and then described it as a 'random' idea. She then told me she wasn't going to come. She told me she was upset and didn't want to speak about it over text. So, I called her. She also said she didn't want to explain herself over the phone. So, I invited her to come to my house. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe came over. She strutted through the front door and into my room where I was getting ready to go out. She started to explain herself and then stopped to ask my why I was still putting my makeup on. - At this point I recognise that I could have handled this part of the situation better. I could have given her the attention she wanted straight away. But, I had just got off the phone with her having shouted at me for 5 minutes without explaining what I had done wrong. I was feeling defensive, particularly because she was in my bedroom and behaving aggressively. - She then proceeded to shout that I wasn't listening and didn't care about her. She claimed it to be awful that I had asked one of her FRIENDS to come to the pub with us. She also mentioned the fact I had met her boyfriend to be difficult for her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was beginning to sense that she was possibly jealous I had become friends with her boyfriend again and was gaining a friendship with one of her friends. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe stormed outside and demanded me to unlock the door for her. I said I would but tried to calm her down and asked her if she was sure she wanted to leave and not sort things out. She called me 'patronising' for asking her this. So, I unlocked the door. - Again, I regret saying this but by this point I was absolutely shocked by her behaviour, especially as she had been shouting at me in my own home. - I told her there was 'something wrong with her head' and she screamed at me to 'f\\*\\*\\* off'.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe didn't speak after that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, then I realised I needed closure. So, I asked her to meet me at a pub to speak things through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe didn't understand that shouting at a friend like that was wrong. She thought I should have been understanding that she was 'upset', even if it did seem uncalled for and aggressive.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe asked me if I wanted to add anything and I, regrettably, admitted that I felt she had bullied me in the past and been a bit of a manipulative friend. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is now the reason why I am writing here today. She told me I had always been the manipulative one. She told me I would make myself out as the victim with all my friendships and then be a 'b\\*\\*\\*\\*' and a 's\\*\\*\\* friend'. She said I had a victim's complex and that the friends I had lost from her boyfriend's friendship group didn't like me but didn't want to say it to my face, so they just ghosted me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I don't know what to believe. Was she the manipulator or was I? Who was the victim? Did she abuse me or me her? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't understand and just want to sort this out in my head. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you :) ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I have a will to live and I dream of living. I am living quite my dream now which I dreamed of before when I was still trapped in my abusive home. (I'm free of my abusive parents &amp; ex) yet I still feel trapped by the past sometimes and on the worst days (they are fewer now but still happen) I just feel completely shut down, have no energy to do anything and I just obsess about things in my head and I dream of dying. But I know I can't die, or even do anything to myself. And I haven't. But I obsess and obsess and keep obsessing.\n\nEven when I thinking back of who I was before I was abused by my ex, I felt like I was so far away from the me who just had not experienced the abuse yet. But only it wasn't me anymore. I just have a memory of who I was, before all of it happened to me.\n\nThere has been so much process though over the years. I have slowly started to find myself again. But there still comes times when I feel like I lose myself again.. still affected by the past.\n\nWhen he left me alone, I was suffering. He knew my past, so he took advantage of it. And he knew I had no one but him. So he left me alone. And I hated being alone. He would never answer me until I kept confronting him. Then he'd get mad and threaten to really leave me. Which he did...\n\nI really felt like I couldn't go on living. I began to have suicidal thoughts of death and wanting to just die, how it would've been the only thing I could do and the only thing I'd deserve.\n\nThings got a turn for the worse when one time he traumatized me the most. I remember he told me to hurt myself. I did. He then made me learn the hard way that I must not make him disappointed or angry in any way or I would die and he would leave me. I began taking it all in and letting him make me do things for him which I was uncomfortable with doing out of the very worst fear that I'd die or he'd leave me if I don't comply. I held everything inside. I wasn't allowed to question him for anything or have a natural reaction for his mistreatment for me. I had hell of a patience for him. He trained and projected me that way. This continued for 2 more years.\n\nHe kept me up almost each night and wouldn't let me fall asleep. I had to do what he says. He has so much power over me. Like he was my God\n\nUntil it was enough. I told him I just couldn't do it anymore. Then he left. I've always felt like I don't deserve anyone.\n\nI've been free of him for a long time now, a few years. But the trauma has kept me awake almost each night. Even if I'm the most tired, I can't let myself rest and fall asleep. Because he never let me sleep before. But I'm supposed to be free of him now, yet I still stay awake....\n\nI've still succeeded to live now. I've actually gotten better this year. And there's really been lots of process. These days I fall asleep around 2-3am, so it's better than 4-6am. But I still struggle to get to bed at 12-1am.. even if I feel like I can fall asleep.\n\nSometimes when I wake up (usually it's on days when I know I don't have to go anywhere) I feel completely different from a good day.. I feel dull, like all energy from my body has just left me and I just feel nothing. All day. Those days I avoid meeting people or talking to them because I half truthfully sometimes I feel like they don't interest me anymore. I just feel guilt if anyone sees me, even though they may not notice anything, because I push myself to act normal. Then I feel guilt \"if I'm fake\" Even though I don't really want to just push myself and it drains me. So after a horrible empty day like that, when I finally meet people, I act like I'm ok and I try to push myself until I actually feel better, but inside I almost constantly feel guilty for having had a day like that and dwelling and obsessing.. (because before I knew that my ex would have gotten mad) I just feel tired for feeling guilty..\n\nI lost many years of my youth anyway, so it feels difficult to hold a long conversation with people sometimes. Because I haven't done it in a long time. I do have still gone to some social gatherings almost every week. I can smile, I can be genuinely happy.\n\nI know the reason why I'm like this is because of my past and everything I've gone through. But I really feel like I've been in a place of an unhealthy cycle that feels endless, and I feel like I can't escape it. I've grown to adapt to it and I don't know how to change it.\n\nI obsess about death and my abusive ex.. and I really want to go back to him. but I know I can't do it.. it would only harden the grip to him and then I'm afraid I'd never recover again. but then if I'm supposed to not do it, why do I feel like I have to do it? So I just feel trapped. I'm caught up in imaginations and I just wish he would appear by my window, break in, and finally come to kill me..\n\nYet I still dream of living, normal and healthy. Friends and a family, love, peace and purpose. I have many dreams.. but this just feels insurmountable. I'm still here, and I wonder if I can ever get over this. I know I shouldn't be living in my past anymore... And I've really started to live and slowly head in the right direction in my life, towards the healed life that I still want to live. But if at the end of the day I always come back to struggling with this... how can I ever overcome this?\n\nAt my worst, feel like I've lost all my worth as a human being. And I feel guilty for feeling like that. I feel I just deserve to be treated wrongly. And okay this one I'm afraid to say. the bad thing is that I started to enjoy the pain, because I felt it too much all these years. So I feel like I'm still in love with my ex and the pain... It's messed up I know. Or maybe I'm really not and it's an illusion. But I feel fascinated by it. I still do desire real mutual love.. but I haven't got it and I don't know if I can still have it someday. I don't know if I can ever adapt to a normal healthy life again after been so deeply damaged since my youth. Please help me.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

He was my first experience with a narc, and before that I guess I was naive enough to think most people were genuinely good and meant it when they said they loved me. It was actually an old friend who told me my ex was a narc while I was seeing him. After I left him it was so hard, but god I was free. This sub helped me so much. It helped me realize I'm not alone, and no not everything to ever go wrong was my fault. It helped me grow, overcome and have patience with myself.

When I was 4 my mom remarried, my stepdad basically became my dad since my father was completely out of the picture. That first year of having him as my dad was perfect. We had nice cars, a vacation home, gadgets, game systems, etc. The icing on the cake was we still had amazing times together as a family, there was never a dull moment and everyone in the family seemed happy.\n\nEverything started to go south sometime after my 5th birthday. He would come home late, skip dinner, things in the house started to go missing, he would take me strange places, and he started to get aggressive with the family. It eventually escalated to straight up abuse. He would verbally abuse my sister about her body and beat on my mom and brother. I kind of got off easy, the worst he did was force feed me and yell at me if I didn't finish my food. Eventually, I became a chubby kid which eventually led to him shaming me for being chubby, luckily I didn't have to deal with that for long. My mom had enough after about 1 year, the beatings were getting worse and he was starting to target us, the kids, more often.\n\nBefore my mom left she tried to get all of us kids out of the house because she was scared of a fight breaking out. I don't know how it all happened but I was the last kid left in the house to send off somewhere.   I'm fuzzy on the details from that night, but somehow my stepdad figured out that my mom was going to leave him. He went ballistic, out of nowhere things were getting physical. I remember him just punching my mom in the face and she tried to fight back but it was no good. She was trying so hard to scream and get him to stop. I even tried to get him to stop, I was begging but he just wouldn't listen. He just turn around and yelled at me to get out of the room, my mom started crying and begged me to leave. She promised that it would all be okay. I just remember being frozen in fear, it took so much effort to just crawl into the nearest room. I was so scared I hid in the closet, I didn't know what else to do, I wanted to help my mom so badly but I couldn't. I was too scared to try to get the phone and too scared to try and run away. I sat there listing to the fight, it was horrific. \n\nThe last thing I distinctly remember from that night is hearing my mom asking him not to hurt me. After that I thibnk he threw her into the wall and she just let out the worst scream ever. I don't want to describe it, the thought of it make me sick to my stomach. After that everything goes blank. The next memory I have is being in the back of my grandpa's car on the way to the hospital. Every time I try and remember what happened after he threw my mom something keeps stopping me. I get a bad headache, shut down, shake, cry uncontrollably, or blank out for a few seconds. Would remembering the whole night help my healing process or should I just let the memory fade and die. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPS: Sorry if this is hard to read, I cry every time I have to recall that night so I just wanted to type everything up fast.

From the city to the sticks.\n\nSuddenly, this husband of mine who could barely use a screw driver, joined the volunteer fire department and went to training once a week.\n\nWell, what that really was is  he had made a friend who was a 3rd generation volunteer fireman who remains to this day, a heavy drinker.  They would go to the training meetings (the friend being his mentor) and when the meeting was over at 7, let's just say, my husband would come home around 1 or 2 (closing time for bars).\n\nI took care of all the kids and questioned him on this.  I think I said something along the lines of, \"What's up with your sudden interest in rural fire fighting, city boy?\"\n\nAnd the title of this post was his response.  \"Don't worry.  I'm not going to go into a burning building and save children or anything.\"  He continued, \"I gotta get in with these people.  Seems like joining the volunteer fire department is the way to go.  You know, in case you get a flat tire out in the woods.  Now, because you're a volunteer firefighter, Ya gotta guy.\"\n\nThe fire department ended up dismissing his friend.  My Nex never completed more than 8 months of training and dropped out when his buddy got dismissed.\n\nHe and that friend are still friends here it is some 13 years later.  He and his friend continue to be uncaring fuck ups that close all the bars at their ages of 54/50.\n\nThe level of ...ugh.  You guys get it and I'm preaching to the choir.

But my mother discounts my work and says it is all because of her. She put a roof over my head and gave me everything I needed. Just yesterday, she went after me at my grandparents house. She said that I was ungrateful because i told her i didnt owe her anything which she took as i didnt need to respect her. She referes to me as the girl who has ruined her mother's life and caused irrepairable damage. My 99 year old grandfather was screamed at for standing up for her \"disobedient and ungrateful child\" I've had enough of this abuse. Her blood son supports her and says just as awful things about me. She favorites him and lashes out at me. I don't know what to do, but she has too much power and finances my school. As long as she supports me, she has access to hurt me.\n#help #mother", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I am crossposting this from r/relationship_advice, just found this sub and thought the viewpoint of everyone on here might be useful.\n\nSorry in advance for the long post. I have been in this relationship with my SO for about three years. After about two and a half years, I realized that the relationship was emotionally abusive and left. Unfortunately, I did not go NC, and gave in to his promises that he was a different person now (after about a month), and how he felt awful for how he treated me before and would not treat me that way again. While he did treat me quite well at first, the slowly deteriorated.\n\nI have slowly begun to realize that despite all of the promises of change, many things have returned to the way they were before, just slightly more subtly. Because most of his hours-long rants were about how awful I was for the way I dealt with the breakup (told my mom for support, went with a friend because I was afraid of what would happen if I went alone, etc.), I ended up blaming myself for what was happening because I felt it was my fault for not breaking up better (this is my first real relationship, so no previous experience), and that him ranting at me like this was ok. During rants he would say things like \"you are the kind of person I hate most\" \"you are so hypocritical\" \"when I think of how you broke up with me, I don't want to be with you (and yet here he was! seconds later talking about how much he loved me!)\" and most recently \"you are evil.\" He would also insult my mom to boot, since she was involved in the break up. Be mad at me for saying bad things about him to what may potentially be a future MIL. His voice was so filled with contempt. He would praise his own parents, and then despise my own for something that at his own admission his own parents did too. He would get mad if I started crying at some point during the long lecture (I am a relatively easy crier; he almost never cries), saying that I was trying to control him by crying. So, later I tried holding it in, and eventually it got to the point where I would start having mini panic attacks after the lectures from all of the emotions I was trying to bottle up and my fear of showing them. He then said I was emotionally abusing him by having a panic attack, that it was all an act, and that it was me making him afraid to say anything or criticize me in any way. I had told him multiple times before, I can take constructive criticism (and have), but his method of delivery was pretty mean, and if he changed it I would be much less likely to cry during those sessions. If I would later bring up things he said that hurt me and I couldn't get off my mind, he would apologize, say he didn't mean it, and that I need to learn not to take what people say in anger so seriously, if I wouldn't take it personally it wouldn't be a problem. That is a general overview. For some other details on his raping me and sexual assault, and mistreating my cat (of course always apologizing and promising change afterwards), you can look at my previous posts.\n\nAnyways, after we got back in January, he decided we should marry right away. I had suggested waiting a bit longer, but since we both graduate this semester and he is an international student and wants to stay here, that wouldn't be the most convenient for him. It felt selfish to push a point like that, so I didn't. At first I truly thought maybe he really had improved, with the exception of those hour-long lectures that I felt I deserved and so didn't \"count.\" But I am beginning to come to my senses, and see that yes, they do count. No, he didn't really change. He doesn't think he ever emotionally abused me, and so now he holds me saying that against me. I asked him if he had looked up what it meant to be emotionally abusive, he said not really, but it didn't really matter because these \"symptoms\" of how he was treating me could stem from a variety of things, and only a professional could really see if emotional abuse was the cause or not.\n\nHe often says \"I will never get mad like that at you again,\" or similar words, but he keeps doing it anyways, just after taking a break. He wants to marry this week (more of an elopement, no big ceremony or anything, which I was fine with). He recently said, \"after we get married, I will never get mad at you again. I will love you and protect you, I will never try to divorce you.\" And you know what? That sounds eerily similar to all of his other, broken promises. That is when it fully hit me that he hasn't really changed. That he doesn't acknowledge the effort that it takes to make true change, changing for a while and falling back into the same old habits. That me thinking to myself that he is now different, he won't abuse me now, was kinda wishful thinking on my part, rather than reality. I know now deep in my heart that I do not trust him to stop the abuse. I would not trust him with the psychological well-being of my my child. I do not trust him with my pet. If I was to go through with this, I would most certainly regret it as soon as the words \"I do\" came out my mouth. I want to break up with him. I NEED to break up with him.\n\nWhat I need advice on is how, both for my sake and his.\n\nBecause of the extensive lectures about how awful I was for the last breakup, in addition to the fact that it is so close to a marriage he is obviously excited about, I feel extremely guilty about even thinking about breaking up, let alone putting it into action. I don't want to hurt him, because on some level he cares for me, and I love him. He is fairly nice most of the time, especially right now just before the wedding. But I know I need to do it. I don't even know how to start. It will come as a shock to him, like last time did. Last time, he had suicidal thoughts, and told me he wanted to commit suicide (he later told me in an angry lecture that I obviously didn't care whether he lived or died because I didn't go myself and instead called someone else to--I wasn't any closer . He had suicidal thoughts when he broke up with his ex. Since he is an international student, his family is nowhere nearby, and he doesn't really have any close friends except me, so I could not call anyone like that over for support after the breakup. I am half afraid of him becoming violent (he has hit my cat and broke a pen in anger while talking to me, but has not hit me before), and so plan to do it out in the open rather than at either of our apartments.\n\nTL;DR: After getting back together with my (emotionally abusive) ex, I have realized it was a mistake. I need advice on how to break up with him, as 1) he became suicidal the last time and he doesn't have any family or friends in the area, and 2) the wedding is supposed to be this week. Also, any advice for dealing with the awful storm of guilt and anxiety and everything that I am feeling about this choice welcomed.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I know that no matter what, I'll probably have to see her at funerals for the next few decades. The last few times I've seen her, she's seemed to think that I'm totally cool with her being around, meanwhile I have major panic attacks. A year ago, she even asked me to tell my parents I wasn't uncomfortable with her so she could come on my family's vacations.\n\nRecently, I've gotten intense urges to contact her and make it clear that I am not comfortable seeing her, and I will not tell my family that the situation is okay. I think that, since I have to see her but try to cope by giving her silent treatment, I really want to clarify myself with words. While we were together, I never stood up for myself, and ended very abruptly, only realizing it was abusive over 6 months later. I still regret it, especially since she seems to think I'm cool with it and nothing is wrong. Truly, I don't want any words from her, and I think that no matter what she says, I'll be okay. I want the chance to stand up for myself instead of disengaging.\n\nOn the other hand, I'm scared that contacting her is empowering her. I'm scared that maybe I just want to punish her. But not contacting her is so hard right now, it feels painful. I've wanted to say something for months, but I'm scared it's a bad idea.\n\nSorry for the long post\u2014it's just a very strange situation. Does anyone relate?

From the very first phone call there was instant strong chemistry. He was very charming, extremely intelligent and articulated, and exhibited great knowledge in music - a big turn on for me. We decided to meet and during the 3 days leading up to our date we talked on the phone every day for over an hour.\n\nThe evening we first met was amazing. Physical chemistry, great flowing conversations, and he seemed vulnerable by sharing the story of his divorce and therapy. As a person who went through an abusive relationship with a narc a year ago, I sensed a few odd things:\n\n- He said \u201cme too\u201d on multiple interests/hobbies I mentioned.\n- His life is chaotic - he works as a concert/outdoor shows producer, plus he lectures in a production course, does art installations and other things, while sharing custody of his 2 kids.\n- He has a history of living in many places for short periods of time.\n- His marriage fell apart supposedly because of his wife\u2019s behavior (said she became religious).\n\nHe dropped me off, we kissed and I didn\u2019t invite him over. When I got home I had a panic attack - the same chemistry and feeling of \u201cmaybe I\u2019ve finally met mr. right\u201d with this new guy is what I felt with the ex narc on our 1-2nd date, too.\n\nI decided to give it another shot and meet with him again.

Turns out they \u201cused to hang out\u201d for a while in the past.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m feeling knots in my stomach... We got into his car and he dropped me off near my place, and I could tell he was hoping for an invitation to come up. I didn\u2019t give any. We kissed quite a bit and then I open the door to get out of the car. He then remembers he wanted to give me a gift - two books he owned, that he mentioned in our first date. It felt charming but also a bit too early for gifts (am I wrong?).\n\nWhen I got home, I felt torn and confused. I finally decided to cut him loose, felt there were too many red flags, and that he tried to rush into meeting again the next day.\n\nToday I texted him a goodbye message. He was totally surprised, and didn\u2019t understand why.

I thought it was probably him but it was like 1:30 am so I answered and it was a collect call from jail. He got arrested. He got into a fight at the parade with two dudes and basically beat them up. I\u2019m the only person he really has, he has no parents no siblings nobody he can really count on to be there for him but me. FML. I know I should have left him in there but I bailed him out.

So if he stays he\u2019ll just end up getting kicked out and it\u2019s annoying I have to lose the place altogether when he can\u2019t even keep it. But the thing is if I keep it he\u2019s going to most likely be staying with me because he has nowhere to go and no money to pay for a place to live now. So now it\u2019s like it\u2019s on my conscious and my guilt that he\u2019ll become homeless probably and off himself if I am not there for him. I hate how close I was to my freedom.\n\nAnd I know what\u2019s going to happen. I\u2019m going to fall back in love for no damn reason because he\u2019s a narc I know he\u2019s fake and can\u2019t love. But I will still love him and go crazy again.

I tell him (as I am trying to just speak my truth) that it was DEVASTATING to learn that my husband hates me sometimes and will use that excuse to hurt me. It was DEVASTATING to learn that he requires and demands the one thing he cant give, consistent love and acceptance. \n\nHe is a somatic narc. Last fall he responded to my accusations of cheating with an offer for me to sleep around (actually he has pushed for this for a while, so his buddies can admire his sex toy, I guess). Then he read me a journal entry that I have never forgotten (and have never dealt with): when we first got together (14 years ago) my old friend came on to me. I stopped it, and didn't speak to him again for 7 years. (My husband was the one who re-initiated contact. What's up with that?) My husband told me that he had been punishing me for 14 years over that incident, but of course, doesn't tell me what my \"punishment\" entailed.  My mind races, of course.  The time he was crazy rough, was that a punishment? The times he said he wanted to tie me to a tree in a park and let everyone who goes by have their way with me? Was that an imagined punishment? The times he would lose his erection on purpose if I asked him to not jerk it to his daughter's cousin? Was that on purpose? The times he used me to try to get his high-school flame into bed? Was that on purpose to punish me?\n\nAnyway, back to this morning.  We are sleeping in separate rooms since I left, went to a domestic abuse shelter and came back. I left because he choked me when I turned him down on new years eve (I have horribly painful endometriosis and fibroids, surgery is next month). I sleep in our bedroom.  I often wake in the middle of the night crying and shaking (almost daily). Anyway, this morning I woke at 5, in (our formally shared bed) hysterically crying, again. And he ran across the hall to comfort me, but I was in no state. I told him he was an abusive rapist and slapped him right across the face. The funny thing? I apologized later this morning, and he isn't even upset.  I dont know if he somehow though he deserves it, or if me hitting him restores the balance in his mind? Or is like a week or so ago, when he admitted he doesn't really mind when I get upset, as it shows him just how much of an impact he has on me.\n\nWhat the hell is happening to me? Are we both so desperate to be \"seen\" by the other person that we are willing to hurt each other to do it?  \n\nIts bananas, because I used to think I wasn't this person.  I didn't snoop or check up on his activities for 10 years, because I am stupid enough to think that people say what they mean and mean what they say (btw: me telling him that I have secure attachment and didn't even suspect anything was amiss for 10 years caused him to cry with his head in his hands).\n\nI am leaving him, probably this summer after I recover.  He doesn't want this; he tells me that \"all of that other stuff is behind me\" and I am worth all this counseling work (sure...) how can I heal without knowing what all of this stuff that is behind him even is? \n\nJesus, honestly, I have never felt so betrayed in my life; I cant fathom it. And I am going nuts between thinking that I am NOT a person who hits another person and thinking he got off easy with just a slap.\n\nWhat the hell is happening? Has anyone else gone completely off the deep end with their narc? Am I going narcissist too?  \n\nTL; DR: slapped my narc husband in a trauma rage. Feel like I have become the thing I hate the most.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Long but looking for confirmation I did the right thing?", "author": "ANSI300", "self_text": "I am 5 months out of a toxic relationship &amp; I am struggling to feel any better. I have good days &amp; bad. Some days she hardly enters my mind &amp; then others I become totally obsessed with her. For reference we dated for over 2 years, but we have spoke to each other for 6 so there was a lot of investment. I had recently come out of another toxic relationship when I was introduced to her on Facebook by her mother. I can remember her mother saying she was glad she could off load her daughter onto me.\n\n6 years ago, I was a pleaser. I had no self esteem &amp; this women who was 14 years younger than me &amp; beautiful would always give me her time. However, she made it clear that she wasn\u2019t interested in me, but this wasn\u2019t congruent with her behaviour. She would always be chatting to me online sometimes until the early morning. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I grow to really like her even though we had never met. I started to buy her gifts &amp; drop them off at her house. I bought her phones &amp; helped her with collage work. She never asked for these things once, but I did it basically because I am soft &amp; I probably also thought it would help me win her. She would tell me how caring I was &amp; how she didn\u2019t understand why I did those things for her. I started to get a feeling she liked me especially when she would get jealous of me speaking to other women. When she got jealous, she would block me for weeks then eventually come back telling me how much she liked me. She would send me texts that appeared to be for someone else to get a response out of me. She also had another guy on Facebook that she liked &amp; while he was talking to her she refused to go out on a date with me. This other guy asked her out &amp; she declined then blocked him on Facebook because he went on a date with another woman. I started to notice her behaviour &amp; how jealous &amp; sometimes how she could go from nice to nasty.\n\n2 years ago, she agreed to go out on a date with me. I got a very funny feeling on the first date as if it wasn\u2019t right. I ignored this &amp; we continued to date a couple of times. We slept with each other &amp; she suggested that we should be an item. I agreed although I still wasn\u2019t sure. The first thing she did was to start another Facebook account &amp; put her relationship status up. I noticed that she had added this other guy &amp; some other ones that were previously interested in her. I asked why &amp; she said to piss them off &amp; get her revenge. I said that it made me feel uncomfortable &amp; she deleted them after a while. She became very needy &amp; I had to reply to texts within 5 minutes or she would get mad &amp; send me more texts. I explained that I was busy at work &amp; sometimes couldn\u2019t answer but she still did it. She started to accuse me of speaking to other women when I wasn\u2019t, so I had to limit my time on Facebook to avoid arguments. She started to break up with me over pathetic stuff. This became regular &amp; happened nearly once per month over the full relationship. She blamed it on her hormones &amp; her period however it sometimes happened when she wasn\u2019t on her period. Occasionally during a break up she would call me nasty abusive names like fat, ugly etc. She would check my mobile when she was with me &amp; get mad that she couldn\u2019t find any evidence of me speaking to women. I once moved her mobile to charge it when she was asleep &amp; she went ballistic accusing me of looking through it. She would be on Facebook all the time because apparently, she had forgotten her log in details to log out, but she was always offline when she came to mine which I found strange. Her phone would always be beeping when she was with me &amp; she once showed me a chat message from this guy who told her he liked to cheat on married women. My ex had started the chat with this guy &amp; they were asking each other questions about relationships &amp; work. My ex told him she worked in a bank when in fact she had been unemployed for 6 years. I found this ironic as my ex told me that she couldn\u2019t lie. I said that I think she should maybe remove this guy because he sounds like he is a cheat. She said she wouldn\u2019t but she would block him on messenger so he couldn\u2019t chat to her. I left it at that.\n\n5 months ago, &amp; after loads &amp; loads of break ups she said she didn\u2019t love me anymore &amp; her life was better with me not in it. This came after I had some therapy &amp; was told to start setting boundaries. She called me setting boundaries manipulation &amp; I had changed &amp; I no longer cared anymore. I told her before this break up that one more time of breaking up &amp; that would be it. She obviously didn\u2019t listen. 2 weeks later she got back in touch apologising saying she was immature &amp; we had a good relationship apart from the break ups, but the break ups were not proper ones anyway. I almost took her bait until she said, \u201cyou\u2019re not perfect but you tried\u201d. Alarm bells rang &amp; I could see how she wasn\u2019t sincere in her apology. I said no I am not taking her back. She asked to be friends, so I agreed. She then said ok because she didn\u2019t like me as a boyfriend anyway &amp; I was too old. She then started saying that if I got with anyone else, they better not stop me talking to her. This then went on to her interrogating me whether I had ever cheated on her or had I been speaking to anyone else throughout the relationship &amp; when we had broken up. I said no because I hadn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t believe me again &amp; said had I not spoke to women friends to which I said no because again I hadn\u2019t. We tried been friends, but I wanted to distance myself, so I kept texts to a minimum. After a couple of weeks, she said friends would not work because I wasn\u2019t her priority anymore. She then came back a week later saying she missed me. I said I told we can be friends but she didn\u2019t want it, so she said n because you cant be friends with someone you love.\u00a0\u00a0My head was all over the place, so I started to ignore her texts. She went quiet then texted me again after a few weeks telling me she wasn\u2019t well &amp; she had something personal to tell me. It was about her period, but It was pulling me into conversation because she was opening up to me with something private &amp; personal.\n\nShe kept coming back after a few days, but I kept telling her it was just friends. She said she had been thinking &amp; she thought she doesn\u2019t love me but she does &amp; she wanted to give it a go again &amp; she promised she wouldn\u2019t break up with me again it was just her been an idiot &amp; immature &amp; she\u2019s grown up since which was a bit unbelievable as she couldn\u2019t have grown up in such as short space of time. She said that I was trying to convince myself that it doesn\u2019t work when it does &amp; I would have to face the truth sometime. I stood my ground &amp; she eventually said that I had given her no other choice &amp; she would have to move on &amp; it would hurt but I hadn\u2019t given her any other choice. I ignored this &amp; she sent me one last text saying that it all made sense &amp; that I had been talking to someone behind her back &amp; she wishes me dead for what had done to her &amp; she was only with me because she felt sorry for me. She said I had mental health problems &amp; whoever I was speaking to wouldn\u2019t be long before they met me &amp; then left me.\n\nThings went quiet for a few weeks until I got a friend request from another Facebook account she had made. I ignored it but I had a snoop on the profile. She had added all these other guys that were previously interested in her plus that one guy she was chatting to her expressed how he liked cheating with married women. She had also added her ex who she used to say she hated &amp; once she said she had accidently sent him a friend request. She used to be really up on having her settings set to private. This account was open to the public so she knew I would be looking at it. She posted a Meme in which it said, \u201cI\u2019m glad I f***ed you off you crackhead looking c**t\u201d. Her own mother thought this was hilarious &amp; said she was too good for me anyway &amp; apparently her own sister commented on the same. She started posting provocative pics &amp; chatting with these guys from before in an attempt to lure me in. I ignored it &amp; then out of the blue I got an email telling me that a close relative had a terminal illness &amp; she wanted me to know &amp; she needed someone to speak to. This was really hard for me to ignore but I did.\n\nIt's been a month now since any contact &amp; I am finding it really hard. There\u2019s so much uncertainty in whether I did the right thing or not? My heart is hurting but my head is telling me It was the right thing to do. I was always walking on eggshells &amp; I couldn\u2019t take the constant break ups. Although she wasn\u2019t always verbally abusive it did happen &amp; when it did it really cut me. I couldn\u2019t take the accusations of cheating especially when she was acting very suspicious with her mobile. She would often stone wall me &amp; give me short text replies like \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, \u201cwhatever\u201d, \u201csee ya\u201d then get mad at me when I asked her what was wrong. She would often call me annoying when I was trying to discuss issues we were having. She hated me falling asleep late on a night when she came to see me. She would always criticise people &amp; pick out their imperfections because she was \u2018honest\u2019 even though I caught her lying. She hated the fact that I was trying to save money &amp; she wanted to enjoy herself without saving even though she was unemployed. Everything was so black &amp; white with her. It was either good or bad, I was either her best friend &amp; lover forever or a f**king p***k that she hated. She would say stuff to me knowing it would start an argument. For instance, she would tell me that she couldn\u2019t see me because she was ill. I would say something like \u201cawwwwww ok babe you look after yourself &amp; we can see each other another time\u201d. She would snap at me &amp; accuse me of not been bothered or caring about her. I just couldn\u2019t win!\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe only saw each other once per week so she used text a lot. This was like her perfect way to be horrid &amp; confrontational without having to do it face to face. When we couldn\u2019t see each other because she couldn\u2019t get a baby sitter, she would complain that we didn\u2019t see each other enough as if it was my fault. She would say things like what\u2019s the point in us been together if we cant see each other. I would have to remind her that it wasn\u2019t my fault she couldn\u2019t get a sitter &amp; why couldn\u2019t I just go to her house &amp; see her there.\n\nI have requested some more therapy to find out why I keep allowing myself to be emotionally abused. I didn\u2019t think I was been abused but who lets their partner who is supposed to care about them break up with them loads of times? I have looked into trauma bonding &amp; cognitive dissonance plus intermittent reinforcement to try &amp; get some answers.\n\nIt all sounds bad, but we did have some excellent times together &amp; I did &amp; always will care about her &amp; love her or at least I think I did / do. My head is all over the place &amp; I just hope it all wasn\u2019t my fault &amp; I have done the right thing taking her out of my life?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

(UK)", "author": "redcat2525", "self_text": "I hope this is allowed here, I'm sorry if not. Posted in /Advice but posting here just in case. This has been eating me up for years now.\n\nWhen I was a teenager (about 8/9 years ago now) I went out with a guy for two years. I knew he was into weird shit on the internet, regular 4chan browser, had a pretty twisted sense of humour. I had no friends at the time and my depression was at rock bottom, I was self-harming and pretty much suicidal - I guess I was in a vulnerable, easily manipulated and very confused place and sort of latched onto him as he showed me attention.\n\nWhile we were together he was extremely jealous, manipulative, mentally and physically abusive. He would hold me up against walls by my neck and yell in my face. He would force me into sexual acts that I made clear I didn't want. I was made to feel incredibly small and very much controlled by him, my self-esteem practically non-existent at this point. He definitely had a superiority complex and would always tell me how stupid and naive I was and I suppose I fell into this mindset of 'he knows better than me' and 'he's more intelligent than me, I should listen to him' sort of thing.\n\nHe started to show me the type of porn he looked at on the internet, but it was never anything 'normal'. It would always be on 4chan/b/ or a different browser (I think it was Onion/Tor?). It would be really hardcore stuff, women getting hurt, treated like sub-humans, that kind of thing. Which was obviously really shocking to see. One day he told me he had photos of child pornography, and showed them to me. I don't know why he showed them to me. I remember being shocked but for some reason didn't react in the way I would now, or any sane person would for that matter. I remember thinking as long as he's not out there actively abusing children, if this stops him, then that's surely better. And I let him carry on. And I don't know why. He even received a letter from the police to his house once that he showed me, saying that child pornography was suspected at his IP address or something. I don't know what became of that. I assume he deleted everything but I honestly can't remember.\n\nI have to stress the fact that mentally I was in an extremely weak and confused place and I know if this happened now I would have reported him to the police in a heartbeat. The guilt is overwhelming.\n\nYears later I am only just processing what I went through in that relationship, the abuse, the photos, and so on. I have never spoken to anybody about this and I don't know why it's taken me so long to realise and I feel horrible about it. He has moved to the city I now live in and have seem him around a few times. I feel sick when I see him, and have had panic attacks several times. I saw on Facebook the other day that his sister has two little girls now. I felt sick to my stomach at the thought of what he did all those years ago and what he may still be doing. I don't know if he is still looking at those photos, maybe he has stopped but maybe not. There is no way for me to know. I am scared for his future relationships and for his family.\n\nI need to report this and I need advice on how to do this. I am UK based. I am also fearful that I may somehow have broken the law by not speaking up about this sooner and need to know where I stand here and what my next steps should be. Please help me. I know I have made a mistake here but it feels wrong to keep what I know to myself and I am desperate to make things right.\n\nUsing a throwaway account as I feel I need to remain anon for this.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

His weak and withdrawn father obeys the mother to the point of ridiculousness. When I think of him, I have a mental picture of a dog on a leash. The mother is highly respected by the community because she gives a lot of money away to charities, volunteers, and attends political and altruistic events. She glorifies strangers and disregards and shuns her children's emotions. \n\nThere were four siblings in his family, himself, his biological sister, and two adopted siblings, biological brother and sister themselves. None of the siblings talk to each other much. The brother killed himself at the age of 40.\n\nNA is a quiet, stern, highly intelligent, calculating person, as well as a cross-dresser. He is a hard worker and very capable, able to solve every problem, able to fix anything.  He is smarter, more capable, and more determined than myself, so it always seemed natural that he would control all finances and make important decisions.\n\nHe does not command and order, he creates a situation where I decide that he should be in charge. He is emotionally distant and dislikes my tendency to  wear my heart on my sleeve. \n\nWhen he does not like something I have done or said, NA does not tell me about it.  I do not even know what it is I did or said that he disapproves of. I find out that he is unhappy with me after days or weeks of him giving me a cold shoulder. I leaving the room when I talk, and ignoring me. He especially likes to ignore me when I need emotional support and someone to talk to. Since I rarely leave home and have few friends, he is the only one I have to talk to.\n\nHe never forgives. His resentment can go on for years. He does not admit or  tell me in any way that  I am being resented or punished.  I only know it because I am being ignored, I feel miserable, and cannot explain exactly why. When I confront him to try and find out what he is angry about, he gives me a cold shoulder without any explanation. The situation continues being unspoken and unresolved, and he knows it drives me crazy. \n\nMy car broke down a few months ago. I do not have a car now and depend on him for shopping and doing errands. He likes it that way. He knows that I never liked to drive anyway because I grew up where public transportation was common and cars were not. \n\nWhen I moved to the United States, I never had a reliable car. My first car was such a piece of junk. It spewed smoke and sounded like it was going to explode. I was terrified to drive  it.  Then I did not own a car for about 20 years. NA got me my next car when we opened our business, so he does not have to drive me home any more. It was also a smoke throwing, rattling, piece of junk. It did not last very long. NA, or sometimes our employee took me home. NA was often busy working until late and did not have time to take me home. Our employee often worked late as well. I remember this time when I was pleading my husband to take me home because I was sick.  I suffered from severe menstrual bleeding and felt like I was going to pass out. He told me to sit and wait. I waited until 10 o'clock, but could not take it any longer, so I pleaded again. He turned to our employee with a disgusted look on his face and said: \"Just take her home.\"\n\nHe pays the bills and manages our retirement funds.\n\nWe own a service business together, but I do not work any more. My health and nerves took a big toll, and I am unable to \"work with the public\" any more. So we closed our physical location and my husband now works at customers' locations.\n\nI was the only one working in front, while my husband, and and occasional employee were in the back. I handled all the walk-in customers, accounting, cleaning, ordering, etc. If there were customer complaints, NA never got involved. He left it entirely to me deal with. Sometimes I needed  emotional release after dealing with a difficult customer and I would go to the back to talk to him, just to have someone hear me. He often told me to shut up, he is too busy working. Or he entirely ignored me. There were many evenings where I went home crying. \n\nWe do not have sex any more, had it just a few times in the last 10 years. He told me it is because I am too dry, and he can't get it up because of that. I asked him if he can't get it up partially because of aging, and he responded that there is nothing wrong with his sex drive or his erection. He left me to conclude it must have been me.  I discovered one time that he keeps pictures of scantily clothed women on his computer, and masturbates.  I used to want to have sex with him, but his not being able to do it with me turned me off.  I do crave sex, though, and feel repressed. \n\nI go to bed early and he stays up until past midnight, probably reading, cross dressing, and masturbating. He used to cross dress in front of me for 30 years, but does not do it any more, since I reacted emotionally to an episode where he was overly compulsive. I was in the yard and he was in the house. I returned from the yard and opened the door. He was dressed as a woman and was vacuuming the house fiercely  (for the lack of a better word).  It looked like he was running  up and down the room with the vacuum. The situation looked mad to me, and I must have had a very puzzled look on my face.  He yelled: \" You cannot come in and shut the door on my face. \n\nI told him the situation made me feel weird. He was angry about it and his anger always makes me loose control of my emotions. it makes me fall apart.  When I fall apart  I start talking a lot using wrong words (English is my second language) . He corrected my badly formed sentences and wrong choice of words, and pointed out that the facts I am presenting are wrong since I used wrong words. After I got more emotional, he called me a bitch and blamed me for not being accepting of his cross-dressing.\n\n I  am a very sensitive person, and have strong emotions.  He uses it against me every time we have a disagreement. He has the pattern all figured out. First he asks me me to tell him what my problem is and probes to get as much talking out of me, as possible.  Then he corrects me, because I am too emotional, and my words and facts are incorrect. He would tell me coldly  that I am misinterpreting the situation and exaggerating.  Then I would try to tell him it is not true, that I really feel that way.  At this point, I would get more emotional. I would go to the kitchen and grab more wine.  Then he tells me it is my drinking talking. Then I start crying,  close myself entirely and feel like I want to hurt and punish myself. I feel deep guilt for being my emotional self. At that point I want to remove myself. Sometimes I go hide somewhere behind the house, sometimes I go to bed with the sheet over my head. Occasionally he looks for me and tries to give me a hug, which I evade. At that point I want nothing but to be left alone. \n\nHe knows I spent the night feeling guilty, so in the morning he asks me this: \"What do you have to say for yourself?\" He demands that I apologize. I used to apologize every time, until recently, when I woke up and said to myself that I am OK and do not need to feel guilt. I did not apologize. \n\n I now suffer from PTSD, have trouble controlling my nerves, shake and cry at the drop of a hat. I question my sanity and my own narcissism., thinking maybe it is me and not him that is a narcissist. I used to be very social, but now have trouble leaving the home. I am afraid to speak, fearing I will say something wrong and end up being disliked. \n\nI am now starting to realize that I have a lot of pain in me and need to do something about it. I think I need help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Errr,  I should be working for my exams... Guess at least I'm training  with  english.\n\nSo. All of this started  in  January 2016, I was 13. I just broke up with my ex-boyfriend, who  didn't  love me actually. Y'all know it hurts. Y'know what I'm talking  about  yea ? This moment where you're so fucking vulnerable and  desesperately  need love or affection from ANYONE on this fucking  planet. So, I sent a  message to all my contacts, sayin \"I just broke up  with my boyfriend;\"  They all said \"Oh, I'm so sorry, hope you'll be  alright\" (haha, you have  no idea...) but one in particular continued to  talk to me. I really  liked him before that, he was pretty much a funny  guy, doing crazy  things but being nice at the same meantime, and  knowing pop-culture.  This kind of really nice guy. We met each other  like, 2 or 3 years ago,  but we weren't talking too much, just like...  \"friends\". But not very  close buddies. So, we (that's funny) talked  about Stockholm syndrome,  because I didn't know what it was, and I have  no idea how the  conversation came to this point. I found him pretty  funny again, and  during all New Year holidays we talked by messages. I  was starting to  forget my ex boyfriend even if we were still at the  same place for the  WHOLE holidays because our families were friends and  decided to spend  this time together (an horror. thx dear family. hey  jokin, do whatever  you want.) If I hadn't talk with him, I think I  would have comitted  suicide. I was acting very weird, doing nothing,  not eating, and nobody  seemed to care, especially my ex who saw me each  fucking day. By the end  of the holidays, we saw each other again at  school. Just acting like  nothing happened, we didn't flirt. But we were  still flirting by  messages. I don't remember well, but I think like,  one week after that I  asked him if he wanted me to be his girlfriend.  He said yes, and also  he had a crush on me even when I was with my ex,  but didn't want to  break my couple and just waited to see if I would  stay with him.  So we  dated at my home, because I'm pretty shy and also  my dad was always  coming back home late in the evening. So my  boyfriend and I were sitting  on the couch, but started to get bored.  The... second time ? maybe even  first time ? ...He touched my breasts. I  was like, really, really  shocked and he didn't know how to react, he  didn't understand why I was  so shocked because he already did that with  his own ex (he was 14 or 15,  I was 13.) I didn't know how to react  either, I didnt like the way  things were going on, I didn't want any  sexual thing. But then I  thought... I needed love. I needed someone. A  boyfriend. So I needed to  do anything to keep him by my side. Just to be clear: shortly after that, I fell in love with him, so it was even harder to imagine he could break up with me. Next  time, I didn't say anything  when he tried again. It was going farther  and farther each time.  Touching my breasts was just normal the time  after that, he wanted more.  He touched my belly, kissed me, touched my  private parts... Then he  wanted to try to \"enter\". I didn't want to, so  I just said maybe we  could do it later. But he asked me \"You sure  don't wanna do it now ? I  want to...\" so I said yes. After this, I  turned 14 in February (on 14th  yaaay), he was sure 15 since he's born  in January, and things were still  keeping on. We started to go in my  room, in my bed, and he took my hand  to put it on his own private  parts. I found it disgusting (maybe I was  just not ready), but said  nothing. After that, y'know, usual shit...  Touching my private parts,  making me masturbate him... I don't remember  how many time after that  he wanted to *do it*. Maybe weeks after that. I mean, *coitus*.   I definitely didn't feel ready for this. Oh and, did I mention it ? Of   course I didn't feel any desire. I think I was asexual. Or maybe, JUST  A  KID ? Anyway. We tried one first time ; it hurted so fucking much.  Oh  and obviously, without any condom heh. I didn't even know this  existed.  We didn't properly do it, he couldn't enter. Ewww, I'm feeling  so unsafe  by remembering it. So I told him it was really hurtfull and I  didn't  wan to do it again. But next time we met, he tried again,  saying \"But I  really want to do it, I'm really excited\". But I wasn't,  hehe. Oh fuck  actually it's pretty hard to write this. I think I'm  gonna pause.\n\nOkay  here I am again. So  basically after that, he tried many many times  again, even if I kept  telling him I didn't want it, every fucking time  he was naked on top of  me, he tried again, and I ended up being fucking  scared and forcing  myself to see him each time, scared that he would try  it again, and he  did. Y'know, you know something's gonna hurt your  vagina today, and  tommorow, and again the day after that, but you still  want a boyfriend.  And this, for several months, until july, when I came  at his home  finally for Japan Expo. We slept in the same bed and (he  also tried  this before but not as \"seriously\") we did anal. Yeah. I  clearly said  yes, but I was clearly fucking pretty courageous because I  really,  REALLY didn't want to. But I wanted him to be happy. So it was  hurting  me so much, but I just said \"ok do what you want, but do it  fast.\" I  don't remember if he did lmao. The day after that (Japan Expo) I  was  feeling SO bad omg. Y'know, the \"Why the fuck did I do that\", \"I'm  so  ashamed\", plus the pain all day long and you have to act like nothing   happened. My bf seemed normal all day. Meh. The following month of summer holidays, we came in (french) Britain to see my mother together for one week or two. Often during this time, I felt ugly (as always) but also dirty because y'know, it's some ecological place, so you can't wash your hands (or your body) with hot water at the evening. So I felt dirty and didn't want to have sex. I mean, at the beginning, I was forcing myself as always... But after 5 or 10 minutes, he wanted more, and I just COULDN'T anymore. This is the time I've seen his most disappointed face, and I was basically having an anxiety attack, and he just kept shouting at me because I teased him and then I didn't want only to disappoint him, and I didn't realize how much horrible I was, and blah blah blah. The months after that, it was only (or almost) me coming at his house. It was 1h30 far away from mine, so I was doing traveling in train during 1h30, then the day after that he was sleeping until 5PM because he stayed awake until late on the evening yesterday (me too because I didn't want to go to bed without him, but the rest of the week I was sleeping until 8AM to go to school, so my body awakes me at 8AM anyway except if I was gone to bed 1 hour before that) but I had to leave because my dad wanted me at home at 6PM and a half, so I was just always leaving while he was still sleeping each time. And at   least once a week or two, every time I did 3h traveling to come at his house, this was keeping on. Trying with my vagina (yeah he   never stopped), then my butt, and from one random day I also had to suck   it. So disguting omg. But I really wanted this boyfriend I guess. May I   precise that each time, I said I didn't really wanna do it today ? But   he knew he just had to insist a lil bit so I would agree, so he didn't   think it was a big deal. The big old french rape culture. yaaay. So.  One  day, came the day where I thought I was pregnant, because my  periods  were late (I think it was because of this inhuman stress  actually) and I  asked him if he knew what to do. He didn't. So I posted  something on a  forum. Someone told me to go to a \"familial planning\". I  searched for  one near to me : the nearest was 1h30 far by train. I  asked my bf if he  could come with me because I was very scared. He  hesitated because he  wanted to stay at his home, but finally agreed.  After class, we came. He  let me open the door, ask for someone to  listen to me. Actually he  pretty much just followed me. I think he was  more scared than me.  Finally someone took me in his office. I took my  courage with my two  hands and said \"I'm here for a pregnancy test.\" She  told me to go to  this other office over there, I did. The other woman  asked me many  things about me, and then gave me a test. I came to the  toilets and  failed. She gave me another one (during all this time, my  bf was waiting  in the entry) and I succeeded. We waited another long  time, she asked  me more questions to know if I could take the pill, I  answered I hadn't  any problem even if I didn't know at all, because I  wanted this pill and  if I couldn't have sexual relations anymore, I  would lose my boyfriend.  I wasn't pregnant. She told me I should be  taking the pill from now on,  and have sexual relations only a week  after that. She gave me a box and  we came home. My bf told me there  were condoms, so he took 3 ones.  Obviously, I had sex in this week,  even if I told him what she told me.  He still wanted me to suck him.  Heeeh... Okay. I was getting more  refusing with time, but he sure  didn't notice and just insisted a lil  more each time. After one week  the pill was supposed to be effective,  but I felt exhausted and  couldn't eat without feeling like I was gonna  spew. Not only when I was  trying to eat, actually. Sexual relations felt  even more terrible. The  stuff I already told you kept on anyway :  vagina-butt-suck. This old  trick. After that he didn't want to come with  me anymore, so I had to  travel alone to get or buy condoms &amp; pills.  Pretty scary. Once a  month. We started to dispute. I had enough of  forced sex after a year  and some additional months, and other things  too, because he ignored me  out of sex or stupid stuff like that... Once,  he let me wait for him  during 2 hours and a half, and finally decided  to go play a game I  didn't play with his own friends. We broke up and  again started to date  2 times. Aaaand... We met someone I really  liked... and even \"loved\"  from a moment (we're dating from months now  hehe). I hidden this from  my bf because I knew he would be so angry. One  day I decided to tell  him. He was, angry. I tried to tell him I was  polyromantic, I still  loved him (it was all false. Why did I do that).  This other guy was  pretty nice with me, and before I told my bf, he also  was friend with  him. One day he broke up with me. This other guy asked  me if I wanted  to go at his home to play Halo, I said fuck yes. We had a  really good  time (it was nice to see a guy without him anting  absolutely to have  sex with you). My bf was really jealous. I started to  date with this  other guy. So shy, so cute. Pretty unusual to me. But my  bf told me he  couldn't live without me and asked me if he could get me  back. I said  yes. (why ? IDK.) I'm sorry for this other dude (which is  now my bf  haha, I'm still sorry). I told my bf I was asexual, so I  \\*really\\*  didn't want to have sex anymore. First, he didn't understand,  he didn't  want. Second, he fought me for \"being lying to him all this  time\".  Third... He didn't care and tried again and again to have sex  with me  anyway. Do I really have to say it again ? Routine. One day I  kinda  exploded, in like, 2018. I told him I NEVER wanted him to touch me   again, he was DISGUSTING. He told me to calm down (it was by messages)   and the next time he saw me, guess what ? Yeah, you know it. I wanted   this other guy, not him. So one day, I asked them if they wanted to do a   \"three persons relationship\". They didn't like each other, but   accepted. Finally my bf couldn't handle it, so we stopped. After that,   it's really confusing... I still was with my boyfriend, but sexually   broken, and he kept going on. I wanted to see if I was the problem. I   tried it with the other guy. And... I was the problem. I did feel desire   (I think, at least a lil bit), but was still \"blocked\", so obviously   actually we didn't do anything. If you want details, we tried to touch   each other. With clothes on. My bf was really mad, I apologized. But   after that, I realized even if I was the problem, I didn't want to be   with this boyfriend anymore. He tried to make me feel sorry for him so   that I could stay with him anyway. He really looked sad. So I tried, out   of pity for him, to stay a little longer with him. But that was really   not what I wanted. I wanted the other guy haha. So recently, we broke   up, in october, and I didn't wanna say it to the other guy, to let   myself some time to decide. I don't remember if I told him and if we   dated before that, but in November, I saw this bf again, because we were   supposed to go to Paris Games Week together from his home, nearest  than  mine. I didn't think he would do it again, now that he was 17 or 18 and I  was  16. But heh, he tried. We slept in the same bed, he came behind me  and  started to move. I said stop, I was so fucking scared, he said  \"But it's  to say you goodbye...\" Then I understood he really had a  problem. I  couldn't sleep very long but was so tired, so I did. I hope  he didn't do  anything while I was sleeping, oh god. After that I saw  him twice :  once at a con, he was in the same BNHA group than me (an  horror.), the  second time was so he could give me my mother's guitar  back. Since then,  we're in March and I'm still broken and blocked, we  obviously can't do  much things with the other guy who's now my  boyfriend. But at least I  think it won't get worst. My actual bf is  pretty much comprehensive.  Sometimes, I still have flashbacks, by day  or night. Then I'm feeling  bad, crying, hurted.\n\nI think I'm gonna file a claim. But before that I needed to make it clear to my mind and maybe talk about it with people.\n\nThank you for reading.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

I'm finally ready to open up about it, anonymously of course. \nBackstory, I was a \"late bloomer\" as in i wasn't in a long term relationship until i was in my early 20s.\nDuring this time, i was an unhappy car mechanic looking for a new career, and i was, and thankfully still am, a musician. Also at this time i was religious and wanted to wait until i got married to have sex, and was already struggling with depression and self harm. \n\n I met this girl through a coworker, and we soon started dating. From early on there were red flags, like starting arguments through texts, then ignoring me all together, and constantly bringing up her ex boyfriend.  I had a weird feeling deep down, but chose to ignore it because she was my first serious girlfriend. \nShe would constantly push and pressure me to have sex and i would respectfully decline, until she said she didn't know if she could be with me if we didn't have sex. So, i finally caved, and that night after i first had sex, she politely asked me to leave, keep in mind this was around 2am.  The next day she ignored my calls and texts, i was an anxious wreck. That evening i got in touch with her and she told me i was the one who pressured her. That confused the hell out of me. \n\nFast forward, i moved in with her into her house where she was living rent free(her mom owned it) \nThe emotional abuse slowly escalated, first subtle jabs, then outright berating me for playing music, and wanting to see my family and  friends. In time i stopped all of that to appease her. All of my money went to her as \"rent\" but she would just spend it on weed. I bought the groceries but i wasn't allowed to eat them, did the household chores but was called a useless piece of shit. \n\nShe'd pick fights with me every day and berate me for standing up for myself, and as retribution, she would sick her dog on me. She'd send me on errands after midnight, when i had to get up for work at 5, and throw me out of the house for disagreeing with her. \n\nOur sex life was very negative, any time i would try to initiate, she'd call me a pervert. We would only have sex when she wanted, and when she was done, i didn't matter, shed ask me to leave the room and then ignore me. She would compare me to her exes and get angry when i told her to stop, saying id never be as good as them. She would throw me out of the house when i didnt want to have sex and to manipulate me into sex, she would say, if you wont, ill find someone who will. \n\nThe final straw came when she started telling me to kill myself. One night, during a fight, she said \"just go kill yourself, and do it right this time.\"  At that i swallowed a whole bottle of pills in front of her, and she then threw me out the door. I woke up the next morning at my parents house. \n\nWith help from my psychiatrist, i finally had the strength to leave her. In the year since, i still struggle with ptsd from the abuse, but i am improving.   There are more details i cant remember but i hope you get the point. Thanks for reading this far, i just wanted to share this. ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

My grandmother exhibited a lot of the signs and traits as well, and her actions, while generally not outright abusive, have clearly impacted her children and their life choices, including my mother's choice in husband. And my tight-knit group of childhood friends was ripped apart by one friend's manipulation and abuse of another friend, among other less notable run-ins that ended in easy surgical removal from my life.\n\nBut I've been extremely fortunate to avoid protracted dealing with narcissism in my career. Until now. (Sorry, this ~~might be~~ is a long rant because I feel like there's no one I can talk to about it other than my SO and he's dealing with his own career stress right now and doesn't need me to pile on. Thanks for providing a place for me to empty the narc trash bin of my soul. Using an alt account to avoid IRL entanglement.)\n\n**Tldr; A narc who is NOT my supervisor undermines my efforts to do my job, blames me for a communication breakdown she caused, seizes control of a project I\u2019m supposed to be managing, then disparages me to the CEO of our organization. Please send help.**\n\nSo I was recently hired as a project manager at an organization, and assigned a project that was technically in-progress before I arrived but still in the planning stage and way behind schedule. It's is a collaboration between a couple of the departments at my workplace and an external partner (EP, henceforth), and there's been a ton of turnover in the people working on it.\n\nMy typical approach in a situation like this is to assemble the key people and spend a little time getting to know one another, establishing common vocabulary and understanding of the goals of the project. Enter Narcissa, the head of another department, who is not my boss and does not have any direct authority to supervise my work or reprimand me.\n\nAlthough she didn't directly criticize my management of the project early on in the process, she also basically refused to acknowledge the planning work I did and actively disrupted several meetings I convened, usually by interrupting the agenda that had been circulated ahead of time to insist that we immediately discuss whatever topic she considered a priority. She'd then monopolize the rest of the time and we'd end up skipping all of the team building, discussion and planning work I wanted to accomplish; activities that were largely intended to help avoid conflicts as we moved into more work-intensive phases of the project. (Spoiler: conflicts arose)\n\nThat was my first red flag. Then my boss (Boss, who is awesome and one of the only things keeping me in this job right now) told me, very diplomatically, that Narcissa has a bit of a reputation in our organization for being \u201cdifficult.\u201d He later revealed that working in close physical proximity to Narcissa played a role in my predecessor\u2019s decision to take another job, and that when I was hired he had to insist that my workspace be housed in a different part of the building. Red flag number two.\n\nWhatever, though, at that point I was annoyed but still pretty happy in my work and things were moving along with the project with only a few minor hiccups. Then EP blew a deadline by more than two weeks. Not ideal, but also not a disaster, except EP sent an email to everyone on the team asking for feedback on the overdue work within one business day, when we\u2019d originally allotted two weeks for feedback and revision. Still not a disaster, and (with Boss\u2019s support) I sent an email to EP and the designated point person in Narcissa\u2019s department to recommend that we truncate the process but still take a few days to discuss and compile our notes.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if Narcissa\u2019s point person didn\u2019t pass along this message, or if it was just disregarded, but Narcissa added her feedback directly to a google doc EP shared without discussing it with me first, then emailed me (without cc\u2019ing Boss) to ask \u201cAre you planning on working on this?\u201d\n\nThat was the point when I started feeling that familiar churn in my stomach, the vague \u201coh shit, is my narc detector going off?\u201d feeling.\n\nSince she\u2019d already moved ahead without the rest of the team, I quickly worked with everyone else to compile our feedback and added it to the document. Everything was fine for a about a day; EP and I discussed aspects of the work via the Gdoc comment feature and were generally moving things forward.\n\nThen Narcissa started leaving comments criticizing some of the points raised in the feedback I\u2019d compiled, directly contradicting or arguing with some of the suggestions. Then she sends an email to the team and EP, repeating her criticism. In response, EP (understandably) asked that the folks in our organization spend some time getting on the same page, because it was becoming unclear how their team should respond.\n\nI set up a meeting, propose an agenda, and hear nothing in response. Narcissa comes to the meeting, immediately says she wants to talk first, and then informs me and Boss that she\u2019s decided to take over all communication related to the project \u201cat EP\u2019s request,\u201d because *my* feedback (added by me, but compiled from a few people) was too detailed and disrespectful of EP\u2019s experience in a field related to the project.\n\nWut?\n\nI should probably clarify that Narcissa is the head of one department, and Boss and I work in another. The head of our department is Boss\u2019s supervisor. So while she outranks both of us on an organizational level, she doesn\u2019t actually have any official authority to tell us what to do or oversee our work, and her actions have blown past a ton of established procedures. She\u2019s roughly 5 years older than me, at most, and has a bachelors in a totally unrelated field while my degree is directly related to the work of our organization. I also have an MBA and around ten years of experience working in the same field as EP. This only matters to the story because she regularly references my \u201clack of experience\u201d and \u201climited knowledge\u201d in conversations with me and others. That\u2019s got to be, like, red flag number 5 at this point, right?\n\nI was still in a little bit of denial, because you have to love the self-doubt and second guessing that comes from being the victim of narcissistic abuse, and made some attempts to repair the situation, including extending EP an offer to get coffee and smooth things over (sanctioned by Boss and his supervisor), which EP took me up on. Narcissa saw the meeting on my calendar and called me while I was on the way there to scold me for \u201cgoing behind her back.\u201d\n\nWell, the meeting with EP revealed a number of things, including the fact that EP told Narcissa we were going to get together, that Narcissa was the one who suggested changing how the project\u2019s communication was handled, and that EP wasn\u2019t really all that upset about the edits, they were just different in nature than what she\u2019d been told to expect by Narcissa.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m seeing so many red flags that I feel like I\u2019m at a rally in Tiananmen Square. I wish I could say that her inappropriate behavior resulted in a swift intervention by organizational leadership, but of course that never seems to be the case when appealing to authority for help in dealing with a narcissist.\n\nBoss\u2019s supervisor met with me and Boss yesterday to tell us that Narcissa had gone to the CEO of our organization to complain about my conduct, including that I\u2019d gone for coffee with EP, given a \u2018tentative\u2019 response to a meeting I wasn\u2019t sure I could make, and the fact that I\u2019d revoked Narcissa\u2019s ability to see the details of my calendar events (she can still see when I\u2019m busy/free, but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with her having the ability to monitor my activities).\n\nShe pretty much owes her entire career at our organization to the CEO; he hired her when he was in a more junior position and she successfully hitched her wagon to his rising star. As is so often the case, he seems to only see her good attributes and assumes her good intentions. Boss\u2019s supervisor seems a little more critical, but her position is that we just need to power through this project (another 9 months of work) and then we address some of these issues. Boss was initially a bit torn, but I felt comfortable pointing out the examples of projection, triangulation, negative emotional sublimation and other narc behaviors I\u2019d observed and now Boss and I are more or less on the same page.\n\nSo here I sit. According to Boss\u2019s supervisor, Narcissa basically told the CEO that she doesn\u2019t feel I\u2019m trustworthy and she thinks I\u2019m operating with ill-intent. While right-to-work termination isn\u2019t really a concern for me, I\u2019m still really worried about how this is going to impact my job long-term. I love every other aspect of my work; I\u2019ve dreamed of working at this organization and everyone else, including the poor souls in Narcissa\u2019s department, are all wonderful people. I\u2019m only six months into this job, and finding a new one is not a desirable option right now. Ideally I would just limit how much I interact with her and her department, but that\u2019s also not really an option due to the nature of our work.\n\nHow do I protect my sanity and dignity here? Given my past traumatic experiences, how can I avoid ceding emotional control or otherwise avert triggered emotional responses? Am I the asshole? Why do narcissists have to be such malignant, terrible day/life ruiners? Will anyone join me in shaking fists at the sky?\n\nThanks for the read if you made it this far!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He told me how much he missed me, I didn't really remember him but he kept telling me about how I helped him get through a pretty rough spot in his life and junk like that so even though I didn't really remember him and I felt weird about this. I kept talking to him, I thought I was just crazy. He talked about his ex a lot and how she was a crazy bitch. he told me she cheated on him the night he proposed to her and they had been together for 7 years. I have had crazy exes, so I ignored those red flags and proceeded with caution. \n\nI ignored my self saying this is weird and just kept talking to him, he was pretty nice and we had so much in common! For almost every thing I liked he had a me too! we talked long periods of time to begin with. He told me he was coming where I live for work and he said he wanted to try and see if we could work out and even though I said that I didnt want a serious relationship over and over and I said no promises a lot he kept escalating and saying we were closer and closer and I corrected him at first and he kept saying things that were geared toward marriage. \n\nHe told many lies, some of which I corrected or questioned, he would straight up ignore my questions like he didnt see them or change the subject.  He told me a close relative passed out and hit their head and was hospitalized and they found a brain tumor and operated on it in less than 2 days, then a while later like a week or so they died and then like two weeks later the same person was calling him while we were on video chat. He said his father was dead and told me wisdom he learned from him and shit like that... A breif internet search determined that was a lie. He lied about his last name. He lied about like a shit ton of things and most were just like wtf, why?!?! \n\nOne time he ignored me for two days and he said he drove far away to get me a ring, and he showed it to me, but he had showed me a different one he also said he got me weeks before that and i think he just forgot that lie. He told me to stop my birth control before he gets here and things like that.

I don't even know why i went along with it for so long. I think i just wanted something to be good so bad and I liked the idea of being rescued in a way (he offered me a lot of things, stability, saftey, and a lot of things I am not used to )\n \nI told him I feel like something isnt right and that I think that something shady is happening with him and then I said but maybe its just me and my brain making it up and he said it is me and thats when i knew for sure that it wasnt me and he was just a narc and I was right to be feeling like something was up all the times that I did. I would have cut him loose a lot sooner if it had been an in person thing but it was all online. There were much more weird things but i think these ones bother me most and so I should let them out. \n\n\nI'm very vulnerable to things like this, my mother is a narcissist. I grew up believing that i had to be abused to be loved and that is a really hard lesson to unlearn I guess. I am kind of newly NC with my mom and so its easier to unlearn things like this while I'm away.

I never broke it off because I was too scared.\n\nI began therapy a bit over a month ago and started gaining strength to begin setting boundaries to make myself less useful to him. I finally got him to break up with me by telling him I wanted to go dancing for my birthday.  Not drink, just dance.

I told him I would go without him if he didn't want to come, so he broke up with me.\n\nI've enjoyed a few days without him blowing up my phone with his neediness,  but lastnight he ended up stalking me and approaching me at almost 10pm at night outside my gym. He told me he wanted to encourage me to follow the Lord and not myself and to see if I missed him. I told him I had nothing to say to him, and he brought up the fact that I want to go dancing. He then switched into his evil mode and began spitting insults and name calling, telling me how I'm just going to go be a hoe with all of the sinners and that he made the wise choice by breaking up with me.\n\nI shouldn't let this bother me, but it does only because 1.

Plenty of stuff that now makes sense and explains a lot of my behaviour and emotional  problems. Biggest problem seems to be my fear of abandonment. But as I have been learning about my self the past year I have had to accept and realize faults or even mental problems that have been affecting my life profoundly without me havingthe slightest clue about them until now. One of the problems i have found out is my problem with women. I have always had women flirting and showing interest but to me no sign is enough to make a move, that is when i am sober. Sure i hve had relationships even long ones and casual sex but my problem is that i feel somehow intimitaded by women i am interested in.  For example I get matches in tinder but after couple of messages I just stop trying even when things look promising.  Also I typically friendzone all the girls I get to know, propably because i dont feel intimitaded by female friends. In my relationships I have been somewhat ashamed of my sexuality. But now to the abuse:\n\nDont remember how old i was when my 2 years older sister and her friend asked me to my sisters room to play. They wanted me to climb over my sis and pretend to have sex with her with both of us having only underwear on, which I did. I cant remember what if anything happened after that. I do remember not having a clue what we were doing and them somehow explaining like it is natural thing to do. Now as I try to remember all that comes to mind is that I felt really bad and that I felt it was wrong and I kept thinking and having dreams about it, both were extremly shameful and unpleasent\n. I still feel ashamed and i would not want to remember it at all. Im quite close to my sister now but there has always been something i cant stand about her . Her touch has always been very unpleasent to me. But the weird thing is I have always wondered about my little fetish about white panties, untill I rememberd what happened, she was wearing white panties when we were \"doing it\". Also when i was a teenager i used to watch her body and sometimes even jerk off thinking about her body. Now it makes me sick to even think about that. I emphasize body because, really,it was just her ass i was thinking about. \n\nMy question is could something like that actually cause me some sexual trauma? ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I had small children of my own.  For the entire 5 years, I was led to believe that she wanted nothing more than for me to move in with her.  While I was quite happy in my own place (an hour away), I was torn between keeping my own place and merging our families together.  After 5 years, I'd had enough of the distance travel and the allure of a large family, that I decided to make the plunge.  Making this decision caused turmoil in my young childrens' lives (their mother was unhappy about me moving and this pulled us into court and conflict to work out these new arrangements).  Eventually, I was granted the legal right to move, but the conflict with my ex-wife only became worse. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce I moved in with this new woman, things slowly started to decay.  Looking back now, it was quite obvious right from the beginning, but I am an empath, and always looked for the best in this woman and wrote off any disagreements or struggles as something fixable.  This woman HATED my ex-wife, and make sure I and my children knew it.  The conflict with my ex-wife was stirred by this new woman, which added to the stress myself and my children faced.  Over a 5 year period, this woman slowly isolated me away from my parents and friends.  Due to my empathetic nature, and my deep-seated desire to keep our family happy and functional, I worked harder and harder to keep the peace in our house.  We had financial issues due to court costs and the cost of raising many kids, but the lack of money was always made to be my fault.  The drama that this caused with my ex-wife resulted in behavioural issues with one of my children, and without consulting me first, this woman kicked my child out of the house and drove him to meet his mother, berating him all the while.  This led to a depressive episode in which my child attempted suicide, which I did not find out for months afterwards due to the conflict and distance between my ex-wife and I.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe abuse in the house progressed in the last year of our relationship from anger at my ex-wife, to anger directed at me.  Belittling, yelling and undercutting was my daily experience with her.  In three separate instances, she lashed out in anger and in one case, struck me with her hand on the side of my head.  I was blamed for money troubles. I became the adult who did the cleaning and the dishes and the yard work and the repairs.  I worked all day at my job and all evening at home.  Broken dishes, screaming, crying children - you name it - I experienced it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis woman convinced me that my parents were causing trouble in our marriage, and pitted me against them.  I was told I couldn't trust my friends or family.  Over time, I was isolated to only trusting this woman, while I lived in a house of stress and abuse and fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt first I tried to match her anger to get her to stop, but she could always go louder and longer.  Then I tried being the victim, crying and asking her to stop, but she never did.  And eventually, I gave up responding.  I would not give her any anger or reaction at all to her outbursts - and then the abuse only got worse.  We tried therapy, and while I was willing to go and to take ownership for my part in the relationship, she had several painful outbursts in the office and would not return for any more sessions.  Our relationship peaked with broken dishes, screaming and the eventual slap to the side of my head.  I left for work and came home to an empty house.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then she told everyone in town that I was a manipulative, controlling husband.  She belittled my remaining child and told her I am a monster just like my ex-wife.  Her parents attacked me on the day she moved out, after being a model son-in-law for 10 years.  I discovered that this woman had been calling my ex-wife, leading to more troubles in court and more stress on my children.  And while she moved out and I remained in our house for several months while it sold, every car door and key in the front door lock would make me jump, knowing it was her back to dish out more hatred.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's been six months now.  I still live in the same town, but I have a new house with my child.  This woman has a new man in her life, and I've seen her a few times.  I see her children around town, but I don't approach them and they don't speak to me.  Word around town is she isn't terribly happy, and while that makes me feel a bit better, it has taken months to stop jumping every time I hear a car door slam outside my new home.  It gets a little better every day, but it has been a real eye opener to how well people like this can hide in plain sight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've considered therapy for myself, but I know that this is a mental disorder on her part, so I am learning not to blame myself for letting myself be manipulated.  It is a healing process that I can see will take a while, but I have recovered my life for myself and my child.  I am working to rebuild the strained relationship between my ex-wife and my child.  I have rebuilt my relationship with my other child and we are closer than ever.  And I am reaching out to my friends and family who have welcomed me back with open arms.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI consider myself lucky.  It has been a hard 5 years, but I am finding myself again.  I know I will never let another woman into my life like that again.  I feel terrible for her children, who I parented for 10 years.  And a part of me feels bad for this woman.  She is stuck in a prison that will follow her for the rest of her life. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am glad I escaped.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He said that was dumb and I didn't live there anymore and shouldn't be bothered by his mess.\n\nFrom reading FOG, he did that a lot too. It was always MY fault, MY problem, and if I was going to continue asking him to do things then we should just break up. When I left because of his awful behaviour, he said he thought I would make marriage my #1 priority like he did, but obviously I don't care.\n\nWhen we first started dating, I used to call him Rico Suave because he knew how to make me smile. He would tell me he wanted to go out and show me off because he couldn't believe he got a woman like me. I thought I was the lucky one. We sat on a beach on the rocks, and he asked me all sorts of questions about myself, he would open up the car door for me, he planned a picnic for us, bringing my favourite \"cheat\" drink (I gave up pop) in case I wanted to splurge. He hated hockey, but for our 3 month \"anniversary\" he took me to a game, because he said he liked me that much. He would write love letters and send them to my house about how lucky he was to find someone like me and how happy I made him.\n\nHe proposed to me by planning an elaborate weekend for our 1 year anniversary. I cried when he asked, and kept asking him if he was sure, because I felt so incredibly lucky to have found such a kind man. Then things changed a bit. There wasn't as many kind gestures, and each time we would have an argument he would say I wasn't listening to his side of things it was only mine that mattered (not true, when he said I nitpicked, I tried so hard not to mention things that were stressing me out but sometimes I couldn't help it).\n\nHe planned the occasional big surprise, like birthdays that cost a ton of money and he would get mad at me for \"not appreciating\" them enough. For me, I felt as though he was throwing money to show he cared, and I would have been happy doing something much smaller together.\n\nCue about 4 weeks ago. He sends me a message saying he bought himself cigarettes and doesn't want to hear a word about it. I get mad, from our third date I told him I was not interested in someone who smokes or does drugs because that was not my lifestyle and I was looking for a man to eventually marry and have a family with...he said \"I guess I'm a non-smoker then\". I go to work Valentine's Day, the shared car reeks of cigarettes. I'm a teacher in a school, and now embarrassed by how I'm coming to work with children present. I get home after work, there are flowers, no card..and the entire apartment REEKS of cigarettes, as does the puppy. I huff under my breath and leave because I'm mad.\n\nHe says he wanted to talk to me during dinner but I stormed out like a child, and throws other insults my way. I go back angry, saying \"okay, you want to fight, then let's fight.\" He tells me he wants a divorce. He hasn't been happy in years (wow, what?) and he's done. I don't listen, I'm not sexy, I don't make him happy. He'll miss the puppy we've had for 2 months more than me. I don't care about him, it's always been about me. I sob. I tried to be there for him, but he played his video game rather than connect with me. When I would suggest going out together he would come up with reasons he didn't want to go. When he was upset and I asked what was wrong, he always said work (and we both have incredibly crummy job situations right now). I say well can't we talk about things, can't we work on the relationship and try to fix it? He says the past 4 years have been terrible, so why would the next 4 be any different. No matter what I say, it's all my fault.\n\nI'm so stressed out by what's going on, I have to go on stress leave from work. I stay in the apartment for two weeks, and all he does is throw insults my way, and laughing about what he's saying. You don't even know how to be sexy, I don't know how you found a boyfriend before me, they must have just fallen onto your lap. I don't even know if I find you attractive anymore. Weeks prior, he was trying to coax me into playing his card game saying I could go to the tournaments and be the \"hot girl\" who beat them. How it changed, I don't know.\n\nSince I've left, I told him if he wanted to talk, we could. He asks about the dog, not me. He's cold. He sends messages every once in a while that make me break down again because all I wanted was the marriage to work and for things to go back to how I felt they were...happy.\n\nToday he mentions I have until the next litter comes, I ask what he means. He tells me I have until there are more puppies to prove I'm worth it. My heart breaks again. I try and talk to him and say I felt it was a rushed decision to sign up for another dog replacing the one we have before trying to work on the marriage, he blows up again. Everything is my fault, I'm such an idiot. He reads my thoughts on why there wasn't much sex going on (I didn't feel an emotional connection between us and felt judged) he says that makes him laugh. ROTL. How stupid am I to think that about my husband. No matter what I say, when I try and explain the awful things he says about me, it's all because of me.\n\nHe says fine, I'm done. Let's divorce. I'm sick of this, and sick of you. I tell him to look up paperwork and he send a snapshot. I mention we need a separation agreement first, he says fine draw one up, he'll sign anything to get rid of me. I say I want him to keep his word about paying for some of the debt and helping with my school and he says fuck that. I'm only after his money. The only reason I ask is because otherwise I can't afford school and will be stuck in this terrible paying position forever. He gets even nastier saying I showed him what I thought I was entitled to when I took things when I moved. He said take whatever I want, I took things I worked hard to get or were mine before the relationship. Again, I'm just wrong.\n\nSays to go get a lawyer and leave him the fuck alone. He's changing his number and that I can send shit to our old apartment. Then I get another message an hour later. \"None of this is what I wanted. But we cannot communicate so just do whatever you feel is right and move on. All we do is cyclically fight about the same nonsense so I'd rather it be done with. Get a lawyer. Spend the money. Enjoy your freedom.\"\n\nAll I have tried to do is explain my reasoning in a calm way. I haven't name called, torn him down, said anything nasty. But He blames me and my anxiety (that I have had since before we were together) on the marriage failing. Am I married to a narc? I stayed with him even after he was writing sex stories online with other women, because I loved him and wanted to make things work. But to him, I did nothing. Please help me figure out what I am dealing with, because not only am I heartbroken, but feeling like I don't deserve love after all this.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I feel as if I have moved on from my nex as a person. I know I can find someone more my type in a shallow way, like based on looks. I know that she did things that were not okay. I know she lovebombed me and I know that I would be happy in a relationship without all that excess stuff. I know that unless she and I both were to seriously change, we would not be able to get into a relationship together. \n\nHowever, everyday, I am still plagued by harmful thoughts. I have an intense desire to reach out, to break NC, but it doesn\u2019t go further than that. Like I don\u2019t picture my nex when I think of reaching out, I don\u2019t imagine what I would say, I don\u2019t imagine how it would feel. (Although I know I probably wouldn\u2019t get a response). \n\nIt\u2019s like I feel incredibly attached to a ghost. The person on the other side, my nex, isn\u2019t the end goal. It feels like a habit I have to break, wanting to reach out, but it\u2019s been almost six months, and in any of my past relationships, I had been long over everything at this point, even to a point of hatred. \n\nI talk about her to my therapists and friends completely distanced. Again, her image, her voice, our memories don\u2019t pop into my head when I mention her. I bring her up in therapy to try to understand why I can\u2019t seem to let her go, but she the person seems gone in my head. It\u2019s like I\u2019m attached to the intangible relationship (again, without seeing details of our relationship when I talk about it). \n\nThere\u2019s no point in me reaching out. I just can\u2019t seem to stop thinking about it. I can\u2019t seem to stop ruminating about her- without even having *her* present in my mind. Like I can picture her in my mind, and like my other exes, feel bittersweet.

Long but needing confirmation that I did the right thing?", "author": "ANSI300", "self_text": "I am 5 months out of a toxic relationship &amp; I am struggling to feel any better. I have good days &amp; bad. Some days she hardly enters my mind &amp; then others I become totally obsessed with her. For reference we dated for over 2 years, but we have spoke to each other for 6 so there was a lot of investment. I had recently come out of another toxic relationship when I was introduced to her on Facebook by her mother. I can remember her mother saying she was glad she could off load her daughter onto me.\n\n6 years ago, I was a pleaser. I had no self esteem &amp; this women who was 14 years younger than me &amp; beautiful would always give me her time. However, she made it clear that she wasn\u2019t interested in me, but this wasn\u2019t congruent with her behaviour. She would always be chatting to me online sometimes until the early morning. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I grow to really like her even though we had never met. I started to buy her gifts &amp; drop them off at her house. I bought her phones &amp; helped her with collage work. She never asked for these things once, but I did it basically because I am soft &amp; I probably also thought it would help me win her. She would tell me how caring I was &amp; how she didn\u2019t understand why I did those things for her. I started to get a feeling she liked me especially when she would get jealous of me speaking to other women. When she got jealous, she would block me for weeks then eventually come back telling me how much she liked me. She would send me texts that appeared to be for someone else to get a response out of me. She also had another guy on Facebook that she liked &amp; while he was talking to her she refused to go out on a date with me. This other guy asked her out &amp; she declined then blocked him on Facebook because he went on a date with another woman. I started to notice her behaviour &amp; how jealous &amp; sometimes how she could go from nice to nasty.\n\n2 years ago, she agreed to go out on a date with me. I got a very funny feeling on the first date as if it wasn\u2019t right. I ignored this &amp; we continued to date a couple of times. We slept with each other &amp; she suggested that we should be an item. I agreed although I still wasn\u2019t sure. The first thing she did was to start another Facebook account &amp; put her relationship status up. I noticed that she had added this other guy &amp; some other ones that were previously interested in her. I asked why &amp; she said to piss them off &amp; get her revenge. I said that it made me feel uncomfortable &amp; she deleted them after a while. She became very needy &amp; I had to reply to texts within 5 minutes or she would get mad &amp; send me more texts. I explained that I was busy at work &amp; sometimes couldn\u2019t answer but she still did it. She started to accuse me of speaking to other women when I wasn\u2019t, so I had to limit my time on Facebook to avoid arguments. She started to break up with me over pathetic stuff. This became regular &amp; happened nearly once per month over the full relationship. She blamed it on her hormones &amp; her period however it sometimes happened when she wasn\u2019t on her period. Occasionally during a break up she would call me nasty abusive names like fat, ugly etc. She would check my mobile when she was with me &amp; get mad that she couldn\u2019t find any evidence of me speaking to women. I once moved her mobile to charge it when she was asleep &amp; she went ballistic accusing me of looking through it. She would be on Facebook all the time because apparently, she had forgotten her log in details to log out, but she was always offline when she came to mine which I found strange. Her phone would always be beeping when she was with me &amp; she once showed me a chat message from this guy who told her he liked to cheat on married women. My ex had started the chat with this guy &amp; they were asking each other questions about relationships &amp; work. My ex told him she worked in a bank when in fact she had been unemployed for 6 years. I found this ironic as my ex told me that she couldn\u2019t lie. I said that I think she should maybe remove this guy because he sounds like he is a cheat. She said she wouldn\u2019t but she would block him on messenger so he couldn\u2019t chat to her. I left it at that.\n\n5 months ago, &amp; after loads &amp; loads of break ups she said she didn\u2019t love me anymore &amp; her life was better with me not in it. This came after I had some therapy &amp; was told to start setting boundaries. She called me setting boundaries manipulation &amp; I had changed &amp; I no longer cared anymore. I told her before this break up that one more time of breaking up &amp; that would be it. She obviously didn\u2019t listen. 2 weeks later she got back in touch apologising saying she was immature &amp; we had a good relationship apart from the break ups, but the break ups were not proper ones anyway. I almost took her bait until she said, \u201cyou\u2019re not perfect but you tried\u201d. Alarm bells rang &amp; I could see how she wasn\u2019t sincere in her apology. I said no I am not taking her back. She asked to be friends, so I agreed. She then said ok because she didn\u2019t like me as a boyfriend anyway &amp; I was too old. She then started saying that if I got with anyone else, they better not stop me talking to her. This then went on to her interrogating me whether I had ever cheated on her or had I been speaking to anyone else throughout the relationship &amp; when we had broken up. I said no because I hadn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t believe me again &amp; said had I not spoke to women friends to which I said no because again I hadn\u2019t. We tried been friends, but I wanted to distance myself, so I kept texts to a minimum. After a couple of weeks, she said friends would not work because I wasn\u2019t her priority anymore. She then came back a week later saying she missed me. I said I told we can be friends but she didn\u2019t want it, so she said n because you cant be friends with someone you love.\u00a0\u00a0My head was all over the place, so I started to ignore her texts. She went quiet then texted me again after a few weeks telling me she wasn\u2019t well &amp; she had something personal to tell me. It was about her period, but It was pulling me into conversation because she was opening up to me with something private &amp; personal.\n\nShe kept coming back after a few days, but I kept telling her it was just friends. She said she had been thinking &amp; she thought she doesn\u2019t love me but she does &amp; she wanted to give it a go again &amp; she promised she wouldn\u2019t break up with me again it was just her been an idiot &amp; immature &amp; she\u2019s grown up since which was a bit unbelievable as she couldn\u2019t have grown up in such as short space of time. She said that I was trying to convince myself that it doesn\u2019t work when it does &amp; I would have to face the truth sometime. I stood my ground &amp; she eventually said that I had given her no other choice &amp; she would have to move on &amp; it would hurt but I hadn\u2019t given her any other choice. I ignored this &amp; she sent me one last text saying that it all made sense &amp; that I had been talking to someone behind her back &amp; she wishes me dead for what had done to her &amp; she was only with me because she felt sorry for me. She said I had mental health problems &amp; whoever I was speaking to wouldn\u2019t be long before they met me &amp; then left me.\n\nThings went quiet for a few weeks until I got a friend request from another Facebook account she had made. I ignored it but I had a snoop on the profile. She had added all these other guys that were previously interested in her plus that one guy she was chatting to her expressed how he liked cheating with married women. She had also added her ex who she used to say she hated &amp; once she said she had accidently sent him a friend request. She used to be really up on having her settings set to private. This account was open to the public so she knew I would be looking at it. She posted a Meme in which it said, \u201cI\u2019m glad I f***ed you off you crackhead looking c**t\u201d. Her own mother thought this was hilarious &amp; said she was too good for me anyway &amp; apparently her own sister commented on the same. She started posting provocative pics &amp; chatting with these guys from before in an attempt to lure me in. I ignored it &amp; then out of the blue I got an email telling me that a close relative had a terminal illness &amp; she wanted me to know &amp; she needed someone to speak to. This was really hard for me to ignore but I did.\n\nIt's been a month now since any contact &amp; I am finding it really hard. There\u2019s so much uncertainty in whether I did the right thing or not? My heart is hurting but my head is telling me It was the right thing to do. I was always walking on eggshells &amp; I couldn\u2019t take the constant break ups. Although she wasn\u2019t always verbally abusive it did happen &amp; when it did it really cut me. I couldn\u2019t take the accusations of cheating especially when she was acting very suspicious with her mobile. She would often stone wall me &amp; give me short text replies like \u201cwhat\u201d, \u201cright\u201d, \u201cwhatever\u201d, \u201csee ya\u201d then get mad at me when I asked her what was wrong. She would often call me annoying when I was trying to discuss issues we were having. She hated me falling asleep late on a night when she came to see me. She would always criticise people &amp; pick out their imperfections because she was \u2018honest\u2019 even though I caught her lying. She hated the fact that I was trying to save money &amp; she wanted to enjoy herself without saving even though she was unemployed. Everything was so black &amp; white with her. It was either good or bad, I was either her best friend &amp; lover forever or a f**king p***k that she hated. She would say stuff to me knowing it would start an argument. For instance, she would tell me that she couldn\u2019t see me because she was ill. I would say something like \u201cawwwwww ok babe you look after yourself &amp; we can see each other another time\u201d. She would snap at me &amp; accuse me of not been bothered or caring about her. I just couldn\u2019t win!\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe only saw each other once per week so she used text a lot. This was like her perfect way to be horrid &amp; confrontational without having to do it face to face. When we couldn\u2019t see each other because she couldn\u2019t get a baby sitter, she would complain that we didn\u2019t see each other enough as if it was my fault. She would say things like what\u2019s the point in us been together if we cant see each other. I would have to remind her that it wasn\u2019t my fault she couldn\u2019t get a sitter &amp; why couldn\u2019t I just go to her house &amp; see her there.\n\nI have requested some more therapy to find out why I keep allowing myself to be emotionally abused. I didn\u2019t think I was been abused but who lets their partner who is supposed to care about them break up with them loads of times? I have looked into trauma bonding &amp; cognitive dissonance plus intermittent reinforcement to try &amp; get some answers.\n\nIt all sounds bad, but we did have some excellent times together &amp; I did &amp; always will care about her &amp; love her or at least I think I did / do. My head is all over the place &amp; I just hope it all wasn\u2019t my fault &amp; I have done the right thing taking her out of my life?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I was defending myself instead of holding him accountable 30 seconds into it.  It's crazy - making.  \n\nHe actually said his life would be better without me in it but he loves me and wants to spend his life with me.  I said then why do I have to earn your love? More misdirection.  \n\nHe is so good at manipulating me.  I am defending myself to him. Why? Why do I do this? Why can't I just leave? Like I'm actually considering recording him why do I think I need proof? Why don't I feel like I can just leave? (I know why I spent a lot of time reading some recommended literature today) but this is so hard.  It's so so so hard.  And he keeps pursuing the wedding plans.  And making me feel like if I could just do more he would treat me better.  It's so unfair.  \n\nI don't know what I'm looking for here.  His meeting started 10 minutes ago,  he's gonna be back around 9:30. Stay and listen to more bull shit? Leave a note? \n\nWe are both on the mortgage and majority of my life is here.  I can go to mom's but I worry what will be left if I go without letting him further mentally degrade me.  But if I stay and talk and say I'm going to stay at mom's until you treat me better or some such thing will I be able to stay away? \n\nEdit for update:\n\nI packed major necessities while he was at the meeting.  Waited until he got home and said I would go stay at my mom's.  First thing he said oh so we're done then? I said I think we need time apart. Everything you asked for is labor I'm asking for emotional care.  He said well good luck what you're asking for in a man doesn't exist.  Back and forth for a bit.  Mostly I just let him shoot off.  He said some truly horrible shit like well I hope you don't find someone who beats you and forces you to.... rape things that were graphic and specific.  I said why would you wish that on someone? He said that's what is out there.  A few more shitty things that I'm sure he's planning to include in the smear campaign about my participating in his druggy lifestyle before I wised up.  \n\nI did go to an al-anon meeting.  However I feel there is no point in continuing if I'm not staying.  I want to go to some CODA meetings because that is an issue of mine and things I want to work on but Al anon was a bit too accepting and less holding accountable and with a narc I didn't find that helpful.  Money wise now that I'm not half carrying his bad habits ill be able to afford to go back to 1-1 therapy which I will definitely need to process my grief.  I'm also looking for an emotional abuse support group and or working with my therapist to start one because I think that would be really helpful.  I have fantastic friends and family so I'm not alone but it really helps to talk to people who understand narcissistic/ emotional abuse.  I am so grateful for all of your support and advice it has truly been priceless.  Thank you for listening. I'm not fully free yet but this is the first time I've made it this far.

He called me a slut, he would slide in snide comments when I went out like \u201coh did you see anyone you wanted to fuck in there?\u201d He would ask me endless extremely personal questions about my past relationships (where did you hold him when he was fucking you?). I was not allowed to wear certain things, post pictures of myself, or hang out with any male friends. We fought almost every day and I cried every night. I also resorted to cutting because I felt it was all my fault even though I knew I was getting treated badly I still felt like it was my fault he was hurt. \nBut we actually fixed a lot of things with A LOT of hard work. I still believed he was a good person inside, we both went to therapy and he got on medication after being diagnosed with slight bipolar/narcissistic tendencies. Things improved a lot. He apologized profusely and has not been even the slightest bit possessive in any way. He realized how badly he was treating me and actually changed which was amazing. We now have an extremely good relationship but there\u2019s one thing that has happened. \nI think my self esteem shot down in the months of the abuse because I have turned into a paranoid jealous girlfriend. I never used to be this way. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I\u2019m constantly looking for reasons to distrust him. Could it be anger that is buried inside? I don\u2019t know how to deal with these emotions. I feel he is going to leave me or cheat on me and he really has not given me any reason to believe he is. I just constantly make scenarios in my head and I am completely engulfed by them. Where are these feelings coming from? How can I finally move on after working so hard on our relationship?

And that love bombing is what makes you drop all your guards so quickly. It feels like the best high in the world. But in normal healthy relationships it\u2019s a much slower process before you drop those guards. \n\nNormal relationships don\u2019t consist of trauma bonding. And that trauma bonding really does make you feel somehow physically tied to that person. And when they go away the strings slowly rip from you and it hurts. So you go back to them so the strings don\u2019t break. Normal relationships have a healthy amount of tolerance for what you\u2019ll stick around for and put up with. It\u2019s not sacrificial in that way. Normal people don\u2019t leave and then come back over and over again. \n\nYou become obsessed with them. Because they create so much jealousy and paranoia that you need to know everything that\u2019s going on with them.

I can still tap into that love I had for him. And it was unconditional. But I do not love him. I don\u2019t know how to explain it. I know who he is, I know the mask inside out. I see beyond the mask. The jig is up. So I guess I no longer associate that love I have for him with who he really is. But I still have that love that sometimes floats around up there in the possibilities of who he could have been. Who we could have been. That is what I grieve for. I\u2019m also aware most my love was manufactured by him by his constant conditioning of my mind and emotions. Nevertheless, my love was still very real just conjured up in an odd and sadistic way. \n\nHowever, I just don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever love like that again. I loved the smell of him, his natural scent. I loved the warmth that came from him when I felt my skin on his. I loved every single part of his body. There wasn\u2019t anything he could of done I would of found embarrassing. And there were a few issues he had, but they never made me look at him as dirty or off-putting. I loved how he carried himself. I loved how he had a telephone voice and a family voice and a relaxed voice. I loved how smart he was. I loved the energy he could bring into a room. I loved to lay on his chest and I would hear his heart beat and be amazed that this was the love of my life\u2019s heart pumping blood around his body. I loved his laugh more than anything. When we would really get into a hysterical laughing fit with each other. It was childlike and innocent. I loved the way he walked, talked, ate, moved, he even slept good. I loved standing at the bottom of our stairs and listening to him sing whilst he showered. I loved when he got excited about something. \n\nI loved every single part of him and nothing could of changed that. Not even the abuse. That\u2019s how I know that love was dangerous and manufactured and I won\u2019t feel it ever again. Not unless I\u2019m with someone like that again. I have been in relationships and been on dates since him. I just can\u2019t feel that way again. I have felt like I loved this one guy only to just not be satisfied enough - because it is not the same unconditional explosive love I felt for my nex. I wanted to always be around my nex. This guy I want space from. Nex was my space. This guy I don\u2019t want to touch me all the time. With nex I wanted to inhale him as a person. I couldn\u2019t get enough. With this guy I feel very much as two people. With nex I felt merged and entwined with him as one. \n\nI think I am still coming to terms with not only letting the idealised version of him go. The false him and the what if\u2019s and the maybe\u2019s. But also, letting go of this love I felt and these absolute highs. When we were good I felt untouchable with him. I threw practicality out the window. I didn\u2019t care for money housing anything as long as we were together everything was right in the world. And it is a cruel joke. To have a taste of something so mesmerising it\u2019s like an out of body experience in itself. Only to know that real love true love isn\u2019t like that. It\u2019s not as crazy as that. Because that\u2019s what it was - crazy love for a crazy person manifested and structured perfectly by a crazy person. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to steer anyone away from leaving their Narc. I\u2019m just expressing my thoughts on my journey so far. I would never want him back cause I know the truth of the matter. My brain is just playing those selected thoughts back to me to soothe me I guess. Whilst leaving out all of the abuse. And whilst that love is the biggest drug hit of my life, it still does not outweigh the abuse. It still does not override that. \n\nBut the fact that I can still tap into that love and now (I couldn\u2019t a few months ago) I can do it without really much pain attached to that memory either - I do acknowledge that I still have that love inside of me. It came from me. It is me. I just have to learn to harness it by myself with the purpose of giving and feeling it to and for myself. As for giving it to someone else again, I can\u2019t. It has I feel (even if this sounds silly) mine and nex\u2019s energetic imprint on it.

I tried two times but I failed so now I'm preparing for it more thoroughly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'll start with a brief story so there would be some background. Maybe this will even help someone in a similar situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI (M36) am married to a Narc (W33). We are married for almost 11 years.\n\nShe's not a full blown narc. She's more like a 70% narc. At least that's the result of a trait list I did on her, I can even link it if anyone's interested. I also know a narc that's 100% narc. It's her mother. Both are covert narcs, so not that boastful, just very very controlling.\n\nAs you can imagine marriage was great at the beginning but quickly went downhill. She's has no respect over my time, possessions, aims in life, friends etc. First I had a revelation about NMIL. It was eye opening and after that I tried many things to distance ourselves from her, but in the end it all failed, and they are very close to this day.\n\nAnother important factor in the story is we both had JW upbringing. I won't dwell on that, as this is not the board for that, but it's a goldmine of narcissism. Big influence it had on me is that I viewed divorce as a last resort, and only even allowed after infidelity, totally frowned upon by god.\n\nAnd surprise, surprise, infidelity happened. She cheated on me twice (that I know of) during these years. But mostly due to my religious views I forgave her and we tried to fix things. We even tried marriage counseling but it just didn't address any of the issues.\n\nAfter that my journey began. I went into a shallow depression for about a year. I didn't find any support in both her nor my jw religion. Due to these events I've started doubting and left the cult (it took almost a year). This greatly helped me in the mental aspect. But also due to it being a controlling cult most of my former 'friends' are not talking to me, and there is a looming possibility that my whole family will do the same. So I now try to rebuild some social structure around me.\n\nDoing sports helped me a lot. Physically, mentally, and with finding some normal people to hang around with. I recommend that to all three.\n\nSo here I am in the present, gathering all the strength I can to free myself from this person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is what I still need to do:\n\n\\- save some minimum cash pillow in case I have to rent something quickly\n\n\\- further develop some friends to be able to talk to someone\n\n\\- strengthen my resolve to withstand love-bombing and rough divorce", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When the narc disregards you, you end up in the mindset that there must be something wrong with you. If you know you are a good person, but yet the narc disregarded you, you feel and believe that your good qualities aren't worth anything. This is where the N is attacking your Ego. The N disregarding you makes your ego want to rectify the situation and not want to lose/accept what is. Your ego says \"No way can they just leave me like this,\" and now your ego takes over and wants to fight for the position it once had with the narc. This is the narc's TRAP. They know that when they disregard you for no apparent reason that that is when the internal battle begins within yourself. They walk away knowing you still want answers and to regain what was...which is the narc's illusion.\n\nIn essence, your conscious mind is angry, but your ego suppresses that anger and turns it into unworthiness. So now you deem yourself unworthy, not wanting to desire a new person, and you begin fighting within yourself about who you are as a person. The healthy way to approach this would be to say \"If you can't appreciate all I have done then goodbye.\" The unhealthy response, due to an underlying insecurity within yourself, allows your ego to take over your logic and rational thinking, which becomes a depressing and self-loathing attacking of yourself (ex. \"Maybe I am unworthy\"). \n\nAll of this is from the N, who was able to tap into your weaknesses and insecurities. The N found out what those insecurities were, played on them, and when they left you, they left based off of those insecurities (ex. fear of abandonment, people pleasing, no trust) and brought those insecurities out of you so you would conflict within yourself who you really are. This is so that you become dependent on the narc's validation and approval = their trap. \n\nUnderstand that a normal person who is loving and caring of you would NEVER exploit your weaknesses, instead they would try to help you build them up. The N knows that if they exploit you, it will break you down mentally and cause you to self-destruct. This gives them control of your mind, emotions, thoughts etc, which leads to co-dependence with the narc, so that any time they want to come back to you they have an open door, since you are still seeking that validation and approval of what you're worth from this person who has mastered your inadequacies. If you stay in this state, you will forever be miserable and controlled.\n\nYou have to LET GO of who you thought they were. They exploited you and emotionally blackmailed you. What they did to you was damaging to your core and there can never be any type of salvation that can come from the narc. This person attacked who you are as a person to control you. Leading to a dependency based on whether or not they're happy, validating, and accepting of who you are. If you don't pull out of the N's grasp you will remain locked in the state that you're in of not wanting to enjoy the things life has in store for you. This is all due to a person who was never worthy of the qualities and capabilities you have to offer. You gave your treasure to a THIEF and expected it to be taken care of and cherished just as you would theirs.\n\nThese people CANNOT give you the proper validation that you are looking for. They don't even have anything to validate you...it is all a part of their illusion. They subtly convinced you that they are worthwhile and worth the fight. This is why you are still hooked on them, even months or years out of the relationship. \n\nThey never had any significance of value to offer you. You were the one who held it down. All this is is your ego holding you back. Your ego needs to know that this is not worth the fight, it never was.

Mostly said ok because I wanted to see him. But I decided if I was going anyway, I'd rather do NA.  He was super against it, but reluctantly agreed. While making plans, he said he'd rather pick me up at work, not wanting to deal with my parents just yet. I agreed, and (stupidly) mentioned that I'd told my dad I was trying to refrain from contact with NEX, so my dad would block him. Nex had been telling my dad all sorts of bs about how I'm a junkie, and even called up my dad's job pretending to be a therapist and saying he wanted to help me. And as I write this I know how ridiculous it sounds, but I'm having a hard time listening to logic. \n\nAnyway, I mentioned all this, and the mini golden window closed. Nex told me he'd only take me to AA, not NA, and that I was trying to manipulate him by going to NA, because I was \"pretending to help him with his addiction\", even though he's supposedly not drinking or doing drugs. Makes me think he's hiding something major here. More red flags my mind sees but my heart trips over. He's also been trying to set the stage to have me arrested for weeks now. Messages about stop contacting me or I'll go to the police. But he was full of it. If he was actually bothered by it and not just trying to use it as leverage, he would refrain from messaging me. Block me. Instead he would mention it, then go into a tirade, often spending 24-48 hours texting back and forth with me, usually until I blocked him. He even told me I have an alternate facebook of a black woman, which I supposedly messaged him from drunk. Literally 0 truth to that. He said he'd only take me to AA (not NA) if I told my dad I'd been harassing him, because that would somehow prove I was serious about not drinking (A does not connect to 6, except to an N). \n\nWith all the fkd up things he said to me in those tirades, plus his recent offer to go to meetings with me, there's no way anyone would bother trying to arrest me.

I don't have some urge to contact him or anything, not because I'm worried about legal bs.

She seems to have a lot of narc tendencies, but I hesitate to call her a narc because I know she's incredibly insecure and it truly seems as though she cares at times. I feel it would be easier for me to create boundaries if I had an objective viewpoint from the outside. Here's a quick rundown of things I've noticed over the years, which are progressively getting worse:\n\n* She almost always exaggerates stories, sometimes to the point of outright lying. \n* She compartmentalizes her friends. She never invites two friends to do something at once, she always has to hang out with them separately. \n* When I tell her that I'm having difficulties in my life, she listens for a while, and then immediately follows up with a tragic story about her own life. I describe it as \"story-topping\". \n* If I correct her on something (which I rarely do), she becomes incredibly defensive and will continue to argue until I give up or until I've agreed with her.\n* She often talks about her low self esteem, yet when discussing problems in her life, she blames all of them on the people around her.\n* She feels the need to be the authority or have the most info in every conversation. At least, this is how she behaves. She will constantly educate me on things that I already know, and when I tell her I'm already aware of those things, she continues to explain them to me anyway. \n\nI could go on, but these are the things that are most jarring to me. It's only because of realizing that I have an nmom that I ever even considered that my friend might be one too.

Was completely lovebombed up until the last month. I was never allowed to pay for anything. It was never held over my head. We went on trips. We ate out at fancy places. We had extravagant things. She knew she made more than me, so it was never a problem. \n\nI have a rough home life which my nex knew about so I basically moved in with her after the first month. She needed me to text her whenever we were apart and whenever I hung out with friends or fam she had to come. She never needed time to hang out with people from her own life so we were together 24/7. When we were together I got shit for being in my phone so I never even texted my friends or fam. \n\nI idolized her from the start. She was confident, gorgeous, obviously charming. I was ALWAYS shocked she picked me. I lack in self confidence and this is where i think I got in trouble. But she always made me feel gorgeous. There were only a few times I can remember her making me feel bad, and they were never outright malicious. A \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t spend your money on that silly thing\u201d here and a \u201cyou need to work on your endurance\u201d (for sex) there. Literally that was it. Maybe six times total in the whole seven months. I\u2019m sure there were other instances that I brushed off though, but I\u2019m wondering if they got to me more than I know. \n\nShe knew my passwords to everything. And i was allowed to know hers- but her phone never left her hands so I never snooped. I caught her snooping on multiple occasions but I had nothing to hide so I was fine. \n\nSo everything was great. I never picked a fight. If she was upset I always apologized. I was unhappy being stuck with her 24/7. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved her, I just didn\u2019t even have time to do my own hobbies or whatnot. Then I got a new job and wasn\u2019t able to text her 24/7. Things started going downhill. That was month seven. \n\nDuring that month we fought more, we spent less time together, she got upset with me more. But there was never a clear \u201cI miss you\u201d, \u201cplease just text me a little more often\u201d etc. Then we had a big fight- the first time I stood up for myself. It was over something stupid and we resolved it within two days. Then the following day she ended things. She said she didn\u2019t want to waste my time. \n\nI was a mess. We went straight to being buddy buddy acting like nothing had happened. She cried said sorry, said her friends hated her for it. Led me to believe it was just going to be a break so I was fine. Then she got more distant. After a few weeks I asked what was up and she exploded on me. Said everything was my fault. I used her for money. Didn\u2019t really love her. She has a new partner who kisses the ground she walks on. Etc. I was devastated. She started demanding money from me. I paid some of it and then left her alone after that. Reached out once to say good luck on a meeting she had coming up. She didn\u2019t respond. \n\nMy friends kept me updated on her, she ended up doing the same lovebombing she did w me with her new partner. Blew up social media with the new person when she never posted about me. I was hurt. I didn\u2019t want to believe this new person was so much better. They ended up breaking up two months later. But I still spent everyday of the last few months obsessed with her. \n\nAlthough I didn\u2019t text, deleted her number. Unfollowed her. I only saw her bad side for one day. Besides that, she\u2019s in my memory as a loving caring spoiling person. And I hate myself for fucking up. But I know I don\u2019t need to be spoiled to be happy so I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m still so attached when we haven\u2019t spoken in months. I don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s a narcissist. I just feel addicted to the not knowing of the relationship. Not feeling good enough but being spoiled anyway. I just don\u2019t know how to get her out of my head.

Months before the wedding he started saying that i was useless, a bad mother, lazy, fat ect. I remember him treating me badly and making me feel so low. I dont question if there was verbal or emotional abuse, because i know there was. What i question was the physical. He did bruise me and he did hurt me but he never punched me or kicked me. He would kind of push me down and pull me and throw me aside. Also, These physical episodes only happened about 4 times. Im not sure if my situation qualifies as physical abuse but regardless, I left him because i started noticing how my daughter would cry whenever someone would grab me( for a hug, to dance). Ive told my mom about everything and she says she doesn't believe what he did was enough for me to leave him. If im being honest that's probably what confuses me the most. He made me feel so horrible, He obviously traumatized my daughter and she doesn't think it was enough? Since i left him, he has gone to anger management and has tried to come back into my life. My mom is for it, my best friend is for it and i honestly don't understand how they would want me to go back to him. It makes me feel guilty for not loving him anymore and for choosing to keep our family separated. I need some brutal honesty. Am i being dramatic? Am i wrong for not wanting to go back to him?

Interesting because there was a time when it would have driven me crazy. Where I would have to make sense of the contradiction. Not now.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway Narc woke up from a nap and came over to the living room where I was watching TV. Something about Prince Harry and his new wife Megan Markle was on TV.  COnversation went like this :\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Narc: How long do you think they'll last ?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: I think after shes had the baby they have another 7 years. Tops. Then she's going to bounce.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Narc: Oh. Seven years is a good run for a marriage. I thought you were going to say that she would leave as soon as baby born.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me (after a 10 second pause)  : You think 7 years is a good marriage ? Im surprised that you would want to get married then if you were only shooting for 7 years. Why would you want to get married for only 7 years ?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Narc (after 3 second pause) :  Oh I don't want to get married  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me (after a pause): So a few weeks ago when you were telling me that you wanted to marry me you were just doing that to yank my chain and see my reaction ?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Narc (eyes dart back and forth): &lt;sigh&gt;  I just woke up from a nap . Im not thinking clearly.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me (thinking to myself): Yes. Im sure if you were thinking clearly you would be able to  combine those two diametrically opposed ideas into one crazy-making concept. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is just an example of my Narc's lack of consistent identity.  There is no identity with my Narc. She only knows and feels what is happening to her **right now .** Ive learned the (very) hard way that there is no solid identity connecting her from day to day or month to month.  The beliefs she has today can be totally unrelated and even contradict the beliefs  she had yesterday. Its all about how she is feeling in the moment\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd in her mind **there is no contradiction** because she just needs to feel a certain way **today**. So who cares what she said or believed yesterday. Yesterday was yesterday. Today is today. **This has been the source of the crazy making** for me. I tried for years to know who she was, to discern some underlying belief system or guiding principles.   Something to denote an adult mind at work. Something consistent upon which I could base my faith in the relationship\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn the past I foolishly tried to resolve contradictions and inconsistencies in what she said and did because I assumed that it must all be a misunderstanding. For example, how could she tell me one day that she believes men and women can have platonic friends of the opposite sex (and oh, by the way, shes meeting her old friend Bob for dinner next week), and the following week excoriate me publicly for playing Words With Friends with a female friend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI must've missed something, right ?  Why would she scream at me like that in public when she just told me a few days ago that men and women can be  friends. When she just had dinner with a male friend of hers. No one can be so violently opposed to their own principles, can they ? That would have to mean that she's cheating. Or crazy . Or abusive. But that would make me a victim. Am I that weak ?  No way. Im a guy. I must've missed something. I'll just talk to her to find out what she really meant.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTears are coming to my eyes as I type this now. Just little ones but I feel them. The shame of allowing myself to be treated that way, the thought of how I weak I felt  and feel is probably the worse thing. I cant go back and make myself unweak. Even though I can now clearly see how fucked up I was being treated\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**To the men in this sub:**\n\nIf something doesn't feel right to you then it is not right for you .

There is no way round it. No rationalization. In fact **avoiding the idea** that she moght be abusing me  kept me suffering longer and enabled her.

For example, lovebombing, patterns of crazy exes, need for adoration. Disrespectful behaviours such as using dating apps and lying to me about these exes. The first few times he dumped me, he DID do the silent treatment and cause me extreme pain.\n\nHowever, it didn't take long for my behaviour to become toxic and unhealthy either. Now, I do understand that it can happen IN abusive relationships, however it seemed to persist. They came up quite early, I am talking within months And they worsened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can safely say I became the following things\n\n* obsessive, to the point of discomfort\n* controlling, as a result of extreme jealousy, and I would try and control him even AFTER the relationship\n* argumentative and chaotic, persistent - he did not instigate fights\n* emotionally unstable\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am concerned because it got to the point where he essentially became rational.\n\nNot only that, but he seemed to improve as a person. There were much less rages from him. He appeared more sociable with others (including the exes he apparently blocked). He seemed very... rational in the shadow of my outbursts. If anything, he improved in those respects. He did continue to show covert manipulative tactics.\n\nIt appeared that I was controlling and attempting to twist into a relationship a man that did NOT want to be with me.\n\nIn fact, a man that was actively seeking to be apart from me. A man who was telling me this was hurting him, that it was toxic, that we should stop. All reasonable requests. I called this the discard as it happened so many times and usually was a direct result of me refusing to back down on disrespectful behaviours but it was no longer the stone cold closure less discards of before. Just very traumatic break ups.\n\nLike, HE would be telling ME to slow down, to not be so hasty.\n\nMaybe he became normal?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you looked at the last few cycles objectively, I am sure I appear to be the problematic one. No, of course, he continued to lie, manipulate and blame shift, however his behaviour did not escalate to the point that mine did.\n\nIf it weren't for the first few cycles, I wouldn't even ask this question, I would be convinced it was me.\n\nThis did not improve in any interactions of his. I did not exhibit these behaviours with family or friends.\n\nHowever, the second I got into contact with him it all came back.\n\nI even carried these traits into the rebound relationship I ran into afterwards - although not nearly as bad, and that guy was very emotionally immature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it possible just the first few months of this relationship mindfucked me so bad I became an emotionally unstable, obsessive, abusive bitch?

I will be reaching out to other platforms as suggested by some of you here.)**\n\nI'd like to try and help you a little. I was up late with a lot on my mind because I recently reported a relative for child abuse and the investigation isn't going too smoothly right now since the abuser intimidated his child into staying quiet. While I'm organizing my thoughts, I wanted to contribute to helping people I know need what I have to say because someone's narcissism ruined my life as well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\nI'm the son of a former Correctional Officer. I was taught at a young age to be aware of the manipulations that inmates and ex-cons tend to pull on people so I could distance myself from these kinds people at all costs. These tactics also happen to be the same kind of manipulative ones used by abusive narcissists to establish empty relationships with, and abuse women. \n\n\nI'm in a very large state where there are a lot of ex-cons because of the amount of state prisons. I personally believe the reason these tactics are so common here is because of the sheer amount of ex-cons who pass these tactics on to close friends before making their way to complete strangers. I have insight into how this kind of man thinks which I think you'll all find very useful.\n\n\n**Note that I'm going to be talking about the definitively abusive male** so that you can understand how he thinks a little better. These are tactics that are used by lots of men whether they're abusive, assholes in general, or just kind of dense and think communicating with women requires some kind of disingenuous approach for whatever reason. If you notice some of these things being used when talking to men it doesn't necessarily mean he's potentially abusive. It may be that he is poorly informed on how to approach women and in need of better learning opportunities. However, some of this stuff is inherently indecent to do to anyone.\n\n\n**On The Narcissist/Codependent Dynamics**\n\n\nHonestly, they just look for any one that will listen. Not just in women, but in everyone in their inner circle. They won't necessarily have a lot of friends that resemble their worst attributes. They will have things in common with their friends regardless of their different personalities but what you'll notice if you see these men with their friends is that they're surrounded by people who will listen and not question.\n\n\nWhat this kind of guy doesn't want is anyone who criticizes, questions or otherwise challenges him on anything that he says. The last thing a guy like this wants is to be exposed. He doesn't morally disagree with anything he does to you, but he knows you disagree strongly with anything he does or would do to you. Anyone who he cannot manipulate into subscribing to his falsified stories is just ignored unless he hears something bad about that person. Then he'll say something to the effect of \"I get that vibe from him\" or \"he seems like that kind of guy\" to disparage that person. He's immediately disapproving of anyone who challenges his stories or otherwise puts him in a position to be honest. Dad used to tell me about how ex-cons always lie about their stories. If they assaulted someone, they just got with a bad crowd when they really did it for money. They say they stole to feed their wife and kids when they've never been married. They accidentally ran someone over in the middle of the night when it was actually 2pm without a cloud in the sky. As soon as you cast doubt on their stories, they get defensive and play the victim of supposedly unwarranted criticism. Anything to hide their real motives.\n\n\nI'm bringing this up to highlight to you the importance of being a fact-checker when you interact with people in general. The more you can keep the people around you honest, the better your relationships will be, and you'll be a lot less likely to get yourself involved with people like this who believe that women are necessarily second to men and see no issues with making them earn any possible respect, however superficial it may be.\n\n\nI'm also bringing this up because of the common perception that this guy is looking for the most vulnerable among us to take control of, and I wanted to tackle that. **Everyone is susceptible**, even to a small degree. This is coming from a person who has always been called strong-minded and who grew up teaching friends how to spot fast talk so they don't get conned by anyone, narcissistic or manipulative for other reasons. I could give a lecture on this, and I could make sense to you during every second on how to spot someone who's trying to pull a fast one when they speak to you, and you'll take it with you for a lifetime. I'm still at least mildly susceptible because being human means trusting others. We have nothing good in the world if we cannot trust or be trusted by others. There is nothing wrong with you because you found yourself trusting the wrong person. You are not to blame because someone took advantage of basic human decency. This is blaming the victim which is never the right thing to do.\n\n\n**On Appearances, Arrogance And Sensitive Egos**\n\n\nHe firmly believes that women will let him get away with anything when she likes how you look. They say that if you look the part that they'll fill in the blanks and then everything is easy from there. This isn't uncommon. Lots of men live by this, abusive or not.\n\n\nIt has been my observation that the more success any man has with women - success here meaning a lot of short-term relationships and other kinds of interactions - the more arrogant he tends to become, and loses his ability, or maybe even his desire to hide that arrogance. With any abusive narcissist, this is definitely true and there is no correcting him. If he gets what he wants, he knew he would get it. If he didn't, then he thinks she was just a difficult person anyway and wasn't worth his attention. \n\nIf you're any good at spotting arrogant personalities then this is your best chance at avoiding abusive males that you're looking avoid. He's loud, condescending, his body language is exaggerated, he walks like people should be moving for him, is difficult to make simple points to. The key to spotting this guy is his ego sensitivity. It will give him away sooner or later. One of the most important things dad taught me specifically about being a man is that male egos are real and very easy to pick at. You just have to know what sets him off. It's very easy to expose a man that has a sensitive ego, and he taught me to never to be that guy. Anyway, what you really want to look out for are signs of stress. \n\n**Aggressive and unnecessarily competitive men, and men with sensitive egos, and abusive men are often stressed.** They don't seem to understand that competing with other men for social dominance or just seeking to award themselves with high praise all the time will make them irritable and give them body language that's kind of easy to read if you know what you're looking at. More than that, they do have their own problems and carry that accumilated stress with them everywhere. \n\nA lot of times this happens because these men for whatever reason believe it's OK to embrace that anger. They may even do it without realizing it. Whatever his reasons for thinking as he does, he'll live by that shitty attitude that's actually stressing him out when he thinks it's empowering him. \n\nWhether abusive or just arrogant, he only feels empowered by the stress driving him because it's the only thing that keeps him going. With an abusive male, he will never see his anger or ego as something that could be misplaced or that can work against him. He will believe he was exercising his right to be.\n\n\n**Look for signs of high stress when meeting anyone new**. Higher ego sensitivity often makes them very self-critical which will stress him out further - possibly to the point where he misplaces his anger on people or objects. This is why narcissists in general commonly have anxiety. It's a given that the more sensitive his ego is, the harder it will be to feel satisfied with himself, and the easier he is to irritate because his expectations of himself will not always match reality. Similarly with aggression, your stress hormones can make you anxious, excessively alert and critical, sensitive to criticism, pessimistic, restless, and alter decision-making towards impulsive decisions with less regard to consequences if any. The longer he has lived that way, the harder it is to fight it.\n\n**Just like anyone else, they're not always good at hiding what they feel**. Someone like this believes he is entitled to that ego that works against him long-term and has to work hard to mitigate that stress. Anyone disrupting the peace of mind that comes with his grandiosity is wrong to do it. That's why any kind of exposure makes him irritated and he holds a grudge every time. There's a certain kind of reaction you can expect from someone entitled to unwarranted high praise who feels like he's not being perceived appropriately according to how he believes you need to perceive him. **It's a reaction that is by no means appropriate to a normally reasonable person.** Anyone who has been or has seen someone else who was personally offended knows this reaction. Now imagine that reaction over next to nothing. That's how delicate these egos really are. As much as survivors criticize themselves as vulnerable, I find this guy much more vulnerable, he's just not often if ever a target of attempted manipulation.\n\n\nSomething else you can do to help spot arrogant personalities is to study men online for superficial tones in their voice. Kinda like that guy waiting tables who's really trying to sell himself, or that telemarketer pretending to be nice, you'll notice there's a pitch in his voice that will sound like it's coming from the throat more than the gut. Growing up, I would see this in most of my male friends anytime women came around. I used to pick on them for it but to me, it's not even funny anymore how they just react. You can get more familiar with this tone by going on YouTube right now and comparing casual conversations among a room full of men, and then compare how men speak to their dates on dating shows. The more you see this the better. It won't take long to remember it once you've actually spotted the difference. Then your'e going to start hearing it a lot more. This is something that a lot of guys do, but this is also how abusive men try to seem approachable. It's what many of you know as superficial charm. So, abusive or just kinda dense, this is something you'll have to learn to spot. \n\n\nAnother thing you can look for in videos is faked smiles smiles. Usually the lower teeth aren't very visible when a smile is genuine. Now watch these guys when they're having fun with friends. \n\n\nThese men are trying to sell you confidence because they believe it's something you'll fall for every time. Let's go with that for one paragraph. To better help you distinguish the arrogant from the appropriately secure, you should understand that confidence is just a sense of security. Now ask yourself \"why is he confident?\" What is giving him that sense of security? Is he arrogant? Aggressive? Pretentious? Conceited? Low stress? Approachable and modest? Intelligent? Conscientious and openly well-meaning? Unconcerned with judgement from others? These are all things that make a person confident. When you're being approached by or meetings someone, you want to ask yourself what is making them confident and consider that it could be one of a number of things.\n\n\n\n**Do Not Answer Too Many Questions When First Meeting Him**\n\n\nSomething dad taught me about inmates when he was a correctional officer. The inmates were allowed to have pen pals which he campaigned against persistently for the following reason. One of the tricks they pull on women when writing letters comes after they get her to admit to anything about themselves like hobbies, favorite films, musical tastes, and so on. This usually happens when she introduces herself. When the inmates write back, they say they have all the same interests and hobbies that she does just to establish an empty relationship. If the writer is a gay male then the inmates will say they're also gay even when it's not true. \n\nMost of the time these men and women have very little in common. Most of the time the inmates are doing this to scam women into sending money to the him that either goes to himself for personal use inside prison, or they give that money to any wives or girlfriends they have that they'll say don't exist. \n\nA lot of those ex-cons will keep in touch with those pen pals, move in with them after being released, use these women how he sees fit until for some reason he can't do it anymore, and then move on to the next woman on his list. Outside of prison, this is one step out of many they use to make women open up to them. It gets even worse when you open up about any experience with depression or anxiety because now they'll act like they've had their own experiences with these states of mind even if they haven't.  \n\n   \nThey don't lean on this tactic too much. With experience, they learn when to individuate in order to keep women from being suspicious.   \n\n\nWhen you're talking to men, be aware of when you're answering too many questions about yourself, especially if he's answering questions as well but without saying anything too telling. Catch yourself and don't allow it to continue. **The whole point of this strategy is to keep you talking while he looks for something he can use.** He may even cut you off as soon as he hears something he can use just to try and appeal to you on some kind of common ground. This exact tactic is why an abusive narcissist that I know changed his religion with every new marriage. Even his history of religious practice changes. He has never once practiced any religion before his first marriage, or between any marriages. \n\n\nYou can catch someone in this act by making things up about yourself just to see what he says. If you find yourself lying about yourself but somehow having a lot in common with a total stranger then this a sign that he's playing a game. If you played one sport, tell him you played another. Lie about your favorite color, food, movie, anything. Chances are that he's not going to have that much in common with you if you're lying about who you are. Imagine the odds of lying about yourself completely to a total stranger and having everything in common. Those odds are the same as two people coincidentally writing the same exact fictional novel word for word. You wouldn't and should not believe it. Keep in mind that he's arrogant and you're disposable to him. He isn't going to be upset if you catch him in a lie at first because he expects women to come and go, even the ones he marries and has kids with. Being so arrogant, he'll speak his mind. If your'e worried about seeming too confrontational, it's very easy to walk away from someone when you catch them lying like that. I've told female friends to do this before while at bars and they were always surprised to see how common this is.\n\nYou can also ask him to go into detail about things he says he does and doesn't like. One would expect that someone can give convincing details about anything they claim to have always been invested in. The amount of detail should be consistent with the amount of investment. If he's heavily invested in your interests then you know what kind of detail to expect from his answers. If there's anything you can check in reality then that's even better.\n\n**If you catch him doing this, pay close attention to his reactions.** As I mentioned above, stress and ego sensitivity are necessarily correlating. He prides himself on pulling this trick off. **He will be persistent at first.** When he gets exposed, he won't know that you're figuring him out at first. He expects to outsmart you, and will try again. With repeated failures, you'll see some confusion in his face. He will try again and may even try to project the question on you by putting you in his position. He does that because he wants to avoid the question by making you answer for him. He will definitely lose patience with you when he sees that you're not giving in answering the question for him.\n\n**Exaggerates Perceived Flaws In Your Loved Ones To Isolate You**\n\n\nWhen you're sharing personal information with men you first meet, when you get to sharing anything about people in your life who may give you a hard time once in a while, be very mindful of how he responds and look for any kind of unwarranted commentary even on a subtle level. Inmates, ex-cons and abusive narcissists listen to stories about other people you know for anything that can be exaggerated into something worse than than it really is, and make that person seem a lot worse than they actually are. This is done to isolate you from people you know that he disapproves of, which usually means any other men in your life even your relatives. At the same time this serves to protect the illusion that he's a decent person because he has you so focused on what may be indecency coming your way from other people that you'll never stop to think about him and whether he's a good person. This is a preliminary step towards any potentially abusive relationship whether the abuser uses violence or just psychological abuse. He can't be himself if he has any potential critics or people posing as obstacles for any reason - that's why these men hate fact checkers. This tactic is a key reason why women in abusive relationships so often end up socially isolated with the exception of the abuser and possibly a few other people he approves of.\n\n\nHere's an example of what this kind of conversation may look like. If you had an argument with your father, the ex-con or narcissist will say that your father doesn't actually respect you. At first you won't agree much if at all. You have another argument with dad, he'll say \"see? I told you he doesn't respect you. He'll do it again. Watch.\" Every time you tell him you had an argument, he repeats that dad doesn't respect you and it gets stuck in your head. Eventually, because you're stressed out, you start to remember every argument you've ever had with your dad plus the fact that some asshole said it's all because dad doesn't really respect you. In other words, your arguments with dad and some asshole's repeated claims of disrespect become part of the same memory sooner or later. Without realizing it, you've given in and now you really believe your father is lacking respect for you even if that wasn't your opinion just a few weeks ago. You start to grow apart from dad and then eventually you just won't talk to him anymore. Someone who would be able to support you if he found out you were in an abusive relationship is suddenly gone. Abused women often see these former relationships as total failures instead of misunderstandings and that's part of the reason they won't reach out even when they're being beaten - plus the fact that in this case he may have convinced her that she's to blame for his bullshit attitude and the consequences he forces on her.\n\n\nIt's not just personal problems with friends and family. It's any little thing, even if it's just minor habits your friends have that may or may not even bother you. Maybe it's just the way they dress, maybe it's the way they talk. Little things that shouldn't matter. He'll pick at those things just to make someone seem worse than they are. Eventually, if you really do get in an argument with friends then he knows that you're going to remember all those little points of criticism because he knows they add up over time. He knows the stress will get to your head and he knows he can make you see what he wants you to see from there. Anything that can come to mind as a point of criticism if you start struggling with your other relationships. He tactically disparages your loved ones until he seems like the only decent person you know. Again, the point of this strategy is to keep attention away from him so you're not criticizing him at all, even when you first meet. \n\nEven if he has some kind of bad habit in common with someone else you know, he'll say he does it for different reasons than the other person, then go on about how the other person is doing the same thing for the wrong reasons. For example, if he smokes or drinks, he just needs to lower stress once in a while but everyone else is addicted. Same with anything that can be considered a bad habit.\n\n\nWhen he's using this tactic, he knows when his word matters more than anyone else's after the first time he manages to convince you of anything disparaging he says about other people in your social circle. He soundly believes that if it works once that it will work again. He'll assume that you'll trust anything he says if he can get this done just once, and then he'll aim to remove anyone else in your social circle he disapproves of, which, again could be all of them. Sometimes other women are an exception if he's attracted to any of them but the more abusive he is the more possessive he'll be.\n\n\nThis can also be done to aggravate other people in your life without you knowing. You know this as triangulating. It can play out like this: when you're not around, he seperately tells your mom and your sister that the other said something that wasn't actually true but seemed very plausible for the other person to say, so it was convincing. After a while, they stop getting along. Then he'll tell his potential victim that she shouldn't talk to her family until they stop fighting. He's the one that started their fight. \n\n\nAnother example of blending truth and lies together so that their lie seems plausible, suppose one borrows money from the other. Maybe he'll say something like she spent that money on something else and will never pay it back. If that's plausible because you have someone in your family that doesn't pay money back, or because they don't spend money wisely then your family is gonna fight. Then from the fight, people are angry and now the money that was going to he repaid suddenly isn't going to be repaid anymore. Then the fight results in distrust and other consequences as a result of hum lying. \n\nIf he is confronted about the conversations that started all these problems, he won't dare admit that he said or heard anything and he'll say that situation is not his business anyway to help distance himself from further accusations. Now that your family is fighting because of a seemingly plausible lie, he now has a reason to say you should stay away from them because they're too much trouble. He worked hard for that opportunity and he isn't going to let it slip away.\n\n\nThe only real countermeasure to this approach is to be aware of it and shut down conversation as soon as you catch him making any kind of unwarranted commentary. If you're already emotionally invested in this person, it's in your best interest to make him explain his perspective. If he doesn't have any valid explanations regarding these points of criticism that came up in conversation, it's only reasonable to assume that he's lacking decency for personal reasons be it that he's arrogant, conceited, snobbish, or anything questionable like that if he's so quick to be so firmly judgemental over little things. If he's possessive then he's isolating you so that he has as much control as possible. Long-term, he wants you to believe that he was right about everyone else and that he's the only good person you know. Remember that this is only possible if he thinks or sees that you will not, or do not criticize or critique him enough. This to him is a giveaway that you are too gullible for your own good.\n\n\n**Be Very Suspicious Of Any Language Open To Interpretation**\n\n\nEvery abuse survivor has seen this and probably didn't know this was happening when she first met him. Inmates and ex-cons do this as a way of keeping women from knowing too much about themselves while gaining as much information on her as possible while saying as little as possible about themselves. It's meant to be done in such a way that they seem to be saying a lot when they really aren't saying anything at all.\n\n\nDo not settle for imprecise language from anyone at all. If you go to the bank, you expect the teller to say exactly what you have in your account. You will not tolerate that person telling you what you should or may have in the account. You should expect that same from everyone you interact with without exception.\n\n\nEx-cons and other abusive men do this to get you to answer for them so they can just go with your answer, and maybe give a different one later if need be. If you tell them they lied, they say that they never gave that answer. If you insist then they guilt trip you. If the guilt trip works then they know then that's all they need to know. This is a step towards gaining an emotional advantage over his victim.\n\n\nPersonally, I just don't talk to anyone male or female who can't commit to anything that they say. I never accept answers like it is what it is, things just didn't work out, just because, things just happen, it just is, or anything like that. People who lean heavily on words like would, could, and should? Same thing. Don't settle for it. If I can't get straight answers out of people when straight answers are expected, unless we're talking about something very personal to them, I won't settle for any language that later allows people to modify what they supposedly meant to say. It's just not language that I trust knowing what dad taught me about gang culture and ex-cons. \n\nNo one should trust that kind of wording. If you tolerate a little, they will expect you to tolerate a lot. I know this stance may run counter to what some here may believe about speaking in absolutes, but if you understand my analogy with the bank teller then you understand that some things are only to be stated absolutely.   \n\n\nI'll give another example using lesson from my dad. He taught me as a kid to only say what I mean so that I would keep myself honest and so people can know what to expect from me. He taught me that my word needs to mean something to myself as well as others, and if I thought something didn't need to be said then just be honest and tell people that you don't want to talk about it. I\"m also not afraid to be wrong. Being a good person means being a learning person. You have to be able to learn as you go if you're going to be the best person that you can possibly be. Being a good person means know that you can be wrong, and that you have to do better. I have lived by all of that since childhood. The result is that people I do speak to have high expectations of me which I'm perfectly fine with. I can't understand why any morally guided person would object to the expectations of others when you know what it is that you really stand for. I'm honored to be around people who keep me honest while expecting me to keep them honest as well. My relationships with others are great largely for this reason. \n\nYes, sometimes people have taken advantage of me for being so nice but I don't always care because at least it shows that assholes know I'm a good person.\n\n\nNow compare that to any shit-for-brains you've met who always had something to hide, even if it's the other women he's playing games with. Never wants women to know too much, case-by-case has a story ready in case he does get caught and it's always a lie to some degree. He doesn't like questions, he doesn't like giving straight answers - only receiving them. It's all in the language he uses.\n\n\nA big one to look out for is avoiding questions tactfully. This is a bias in psychology called the red herring. It means that you only seem to answer a question by responding with information that a listener should mistakenly believe is relevant. For example, a friend of mine a long time ago got conned by a a guy she worked with. She was invited to party at his place. She asked him if he was still with his girlfriend and he said \"come on, we're all adults here.\" She questioned him some more about whether their relationship had ended and he responded with \"it is what it is.\" My friend took this to mean that he was behaving in an ethical way and would not be so irresponsible as to invite her over when he's still with someone else. Turns out he never broke up with that other woman. My friend called him out for lying and this guy said that he never actually lied, which is technically true. He said what you expected to be true according to how people commonly talk. He said something that seemed relevant to the real question as a way of avoiding the question while seemingly giving a sound answer. \n\nAgain, you know when you want a straight answer. Don't let anyone describe their position if it's not consistent with an expected answer. I.e. don't let him describe what women have done since women were allowed to vote when you're asking him if he believes women should be allowed to vote. You didn't ask him to explain what women have done for the America since being allowed to vote. You asked him a yes/no question. \n\nIf he's going to answer yes or no followed by an explanation, **that's a great response.** Don't let him hint or imply an answer because chances are he wants you to fill that gap for him so he can keep his motives hidden. If you fill that gap, then he'll just go along with your answer regardless of what he really believes. Don't give him that opportunity. If you do that to an abusive man, he will seem to hold all the same opinions you do even though he never stated flat out so what he believes. That fraudulent persona enables him to take advantage of you when he feels you've established a connection.\n\nIn short, he's doing this because he knows he can't get your trust and give an honest answer at the same time. The more important the question he's tactically avoiding, the worse the answer is.\n\nSame as when you catch yourself answering too many questions, he'll be persistent and will not expect you to understand what he's trying to do. It's the same solution to two distinct but related approaches used in attempt to con you into exposing some kind of vulnerability.\n\n**Listen For A Long List Of Liars In His Past**\n\nFor good reason...\n\nAlmost everyone says their ex is crazy. For everyone here, that's a sign that he's the problem. A much better indication that he's hiding his motives is how often he's surrounded by liars. \n\nIf you're a good person, the only good reason people lie about you is because you have dirt on them, meaning they need to protect themselves by defaming you. Now ask yourself why a good person always finds himself surrounded by people he has dirt on? Why is a good person always being defamed? If you're a good person then you don't need dirt on others to get along with them. This means the problem is him. If his ex-girlfriends and ex-wives all had habits of lying about him, then he's the problem. Don't just settle for him saying they were crazy. This is a lot better than just letting him get away with saying the exes are crazy. \n\nIf he does say the ex lied about him a lot then get him to talk about those lies in detail. When he gets to talking about those lies, because you have all been through the abuse that you've lived through, you know what to expect from him if he's hiding something. If he's hiding something then **what she says is going to be very similar to everything you said to others about your own abusive exes.** Since you know what your ex said to others to hide how he treated you, you can use deductive reasoning to determine what he did to those women. He may even contradict something else he said without thinking about it. Just ask him to go into detail about those lies. The more he talks the better.\n\nIf he says she was crazy and that the relationship supposedly just ended, then revert back to everything I said about refusing to accept inconclusive and imprecise language. \"Just because\" or anything to that effect is not an answer you can accept. Just because is a guess, not an explanation. He didn't guess that a relationship ended. \n\n\n**On Gaslighting**\n\n\n**Keep in mind this only works when he has some kind of emotional leverage against you.** This is everyone here's biggest concern. Again, have zero tolerance for imprecise language that does not come with a good explanation. If someone doesn't know something then that's fine because that's honest but with all that you have all been through, the last thing you should tolerate is any language open to interpretation. Keep him responsible for his own words, and make sure he says words that he can be held accountable for.\n\n\nI know someone who did this to every wife he ever had, and he did it to his family. His speech pattern is just like the prayer on the side bar. He's very abusive and completely worthless. He never gave straight answers when you asked him for anything, but always wanted straight answers from others. It worked every single time because he only did it when he knew he had some kind of emotional leverage to his advantage. He did it to his own mom by using the grand kids as emotional leverage. When she did what he wanted, she got short visits. Otherwise, she was denied visits. Eventually she got the hint that she wasn't supposed to ask for anything, just earn it. She asked why he's like this and he said he does what he does because of her - it's not the truth but he stands by his fabricated story. If she didn't accept his story then he denied her any visits. She eventually just gave in and started taking the blame without even dividing it. None of this is possible without some kind of emotional leverage. If not for those grand kids, she wouldn't want anything to do with this guy even though she's his mom.\n\n\nThere is no room for gaslighting when there is no emotional leverage against you. The point of this strategy is to take advantage of the instilled confusion and arbitrate an explanation to the confused. It won't work without an emotional advantage against anyone because without that leverage, there is no incentive to compromise. There is no reason to be afraid of this when first meeting anyone. Nobody is that susceptible. \n\n\n**In Short**\n\n\nYour best defense to all of the above is to be the kind of woman he doesn't want, which is someone who keeps people honest. If you can check him in reality and keep him outside of his delusions of grandeur then he doesn't want you, no matter what else you have that he wants. Remember that he can't be himself if you can expose him.  This is why I emphasized being a fact checker. \n\nYou don't have to be confrontational. All you need to do is be willing to say that he's not making sense to you based on your own understanding. Don't say you're wrong, say I can't agree with that. If you think he's lying, point out when the story stops adding up, and let him explain it.  **Stand by what you know to be true regardless of what he says, how he says it, or how many times he says it.** Don't explain anything for him though, not even the ramifications of saying yes or no. If you do then he can modify his story on the spot of he chooses to. \n\n\n**In Closing**\n\n\nThis is all I can think of at the moment. If you have questions, I'm by my phone at all times looking for distractions. The CPS investigation isn't over but he wasn't locked up yet, so I'm still welcoming any distraction I can get right now. I could likely come up with more information if anyone asks the right questions. I'm happy to help. \n\n\nBefore I go, I want to say that what happened to any of you was inexcusable. There is never a reason to treat anyone the way that any of you were treated. There is no excuse for the results of someone else's lack of ethical standing. This is coming from someone who despite all that he has been through has always been called a strong-minded person. It pains me to see how often survivors of abuse call themselves weak when it just isn't true. Mental strength isn't what most people think it is. It has very little to do with what you feel. It's about priorities and dedication. I wrestle at my gym. I used to be about 260 pounds until summer last year. Now i'm about 207 pounds. Guys try and bully me all the time because I'm smaller and they feel good at first. It never works. They break down every time because they think mental strength is all about what you feel,  and throwing caution to the wind. Once the feeling goes, they give up because there's nothing left to hold them up. They don't have the sense of priority to continue when they no longer feel strong. They lack the merits that have held up each and every single one of you through everything you have been through. When people ask me what mental strength is, I tell them to think like a single mom, not like the biggest guy in the gym. Single moms hate how they feel every waking moment. They're exhausted, they're hurting, they have little to no opportunity to rest or even enjoy the benefit of sitting down with their own child after all that they've been through, but they wake up every day ready to do it all over again whether they like it or not. That's the sense of priority that most people are lacking. Those are merits that have defined me my whole life, and I am nothing without them. These are merits that held you up this far and something to be truly proud of. **None of you are weak**. Whatever it is that held you up as long as it did is something more valuable than anything that can be achieved just from being in a good mood, and is truly something to learn from. **No one is strong all the time.** Anyone who says they is lying or mislead. I truly believe that all of you have more than enough to achieve what it is that you really want in life as long you never forget that you made it this far on the strength that you had left for such a long time.\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm Thai but moved to France after my mother divorced my father when I was ( around ) 6 years old ( it's a complicated story, my mother used to live in France, met my father there but he got \" banned \" due to shit he did ect.. anyways )\n\nI used to live at my aunt's place with my mother, and the weekends she would send me to my grandmother's place where my aunt and uncle lived.\n\nI was a calm child, until I reached ~10 years old. Can't exactly remember how I was actually, but I remember my mother beating the shit out of me so I'm assuming I was often annoying. My uncle beat me up too, mostly with a \" reason \" but I almost always thought he was wrong.\n\nExample : I remember him shoving my head into the wall when I was in elementary school just because I pushed my grandmother a bit to go to the toilets.\nI remember him almost strangling me and making my nose bleed because I talked back : I had a plush in my arms, he said I was too old for that and I said \" so what? \"\nI admit talking back was wrong on my part, but I ended up with his hands leaving a mark on my hand and had to wear scarves for a whole month.\n\nMy mother was less violent, well she's less strong, but it still hurt a lot. She also made my nose bleed but can't remember why. \nSometimes she was right and sometimes she wasn't but didn't admit it. My grandmother used to beat her kids but nowadays she's chill and never touched me, as for my aunt, she just yells ( and barely yelled at me anyways )\n\nRemember the aunt I used to live with? She was probably the closest thing I had to a mother. I didn't dislike my own mother.. but I wasn't exactly close to her. We didn't hug, we didn't go out together.. I only did that with my two aunts and my grandmother. Sometimes my uncle too.\n\nWhat bothered me a lot about this is that, even though my uncle beat the shit out of me, sometimes for reasons I couldn't understand, I couldn't hate him.. I felt uncomfortable alone with him, it was awkward on my part, but he acted normally.\nI couldn't see him as a bad person, because, besides the violence, he was a nice uncle. He bought me whatever I wanted for my birthday, I went to Disneyland with him..\n\nMy aunt ( the one I lived with ) died when I was ~12ish. It's like my actual mother died. I cried literally every day, I wasn't okay at all.\nI never had a father figure and I lost my \" mother \", I felt really lonely.\nMy mother and I started living at my aunt's place without her. It's very small - a small living room where we sleep, a tiny kitchen and bathroom.\n\nI started going to middle school, had problems even there, some other kids bullied me but whatever that's another story, all I can say is that I was a crybaby. Seriously I cried for literally anything.\nThings weren't great at home either. I remember my mother strangling me too, once also threw objects at me and I went to school with purple arms. NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG I wasnt a stress reliever ( at least, most of the time ) but there was no reason to go this far.\n\nI talked to three friends and they didn't take me seriously at all. One of them did research about it and then completely forgot. I didn't want to be annoying so I just let it go.\n\nThen things changed again after high school and I started standing up for myself. I got into some fights at school, I finally started speaking up. This also applied to my mother.\n\nWhenever she yelled at me I would yell back, and I hated giving up so fights would last hours. I never beat her up, but sometimes even held her wrists so she wouldn't do it. \n\nShe has been stressed for 2 or 3 years. We're always tight on money and her job isn't exactly the best ( either she's working 7/7 either she's doing nothing bc there is no work ) and I can understand being frustrated.\nI admit going overboard sometimes too. I can be mean and I'm aware of that, but I say it when I'm wrong and she just can't admit it.\n\nThen again maybe I'm wrong for trying to treat her as an equal.. maybe I really should suck it up, but the moment I hear something I disagree with, I say it and we start arguing again.\nWe're also lowkey in trouble because the walls are thin and my neighbors complained because of the noise &gt;.&gt; \n\nThing is : we can get along 2 or 3 days but there's always that one thing and we end up arguing, she almost beats me up, threatens me, I cry, we end up staying in our bed ( we both sleep on the couch ) and just don't talk at all. It's so AWKWARD you guys have no idea.\n\nWe sometimes fight for the dumbest reasons!!! Like recently ; she saw me on the verge of sleeping at 6pm and told me to not sleep. I asked her to wake me up after 30 min but I ended up waking up at 11pm with the lights on. The fight started because of THIS.\nAnd in the end? She told me to shut up before she slit my throat and sent me to the hospital ( I'm literally quoting her )\n\nHonestly I can be wrong a lot of times.. I whine a lot, I can be very annoying, I'm aware of that. It's also wrong on my part. But we just can't have a normal conversation. It always ends up in a fight.\n\nI don't even hate her!!! I just can't. She's not bad most of the time.. she can be unfair but not rude. She doesn't hate me. She did stuff for me. Heck she even payed for my braces ( might sound dumb but that's a lot of money. I'm still surprised she did it. )\nSometimes I even feel really bad for her. She had an abusive husband, divorced and went back to France and now she has a whiny kid who keeps arguing with her.\n\nI just don't know how to feel anymore. Maybe all of this is normal and just a part of being a teenager and shit and maybe this happens in every families idk\nI have no idea\nI'm just confused\n\nThat was really long wow I'm sorry.. probably made no sense either", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I wanted some advice from others on this, since the more I think about it, the more unclear I get about if its a legitimate concern that a normal person might have or if it's just her Narc tendency to hide weaknesses and put up the best (fake) appearances to others.\n\nAnyway, this all started many years ago when I graduated school and was interviewing for jobs. (These were positions with churches, so my wife would go along with me for the visits and be sitting in on the interviews.) At one place, they asked me about my plans for the future, say 5 years out. Since I feel honesty is the best policy (especially considering this is church work), I told them it was possible I could end up overseas in 5-10 years. My wife got angry about this and when we were alone basically ripped me a new one, for reasons I am still trying to really understand. Basically, I think it was because I didn't make it sound like I wanted to be in this specific church forever??? (In other words, lie just to get the job.) Years pass and she still brings this issue up from time to time, most recently a couple of weeks ago. We were hanging out with some friends and I casually mention in conversation that I had and interview at such-and-such company a few years ago (different interview).

{"post_id": "b3q21k", "created_utc": 1553172061, "title": "Divorcing my Nex: A vent (TW: some explicit content)", "author": "bobisnothere44", "self_text": "I just have to vent, but my divorce is on going, so I am using a throwaway account.\n\nWe met 15 years ago.  We were both mid-career, although I make about double what she makes.  We have three kids ages 5 to 15.\n\nA couple of years ago, I started seeing red flags that she was having an affair.  Eventually I found \"proof\" and she admitted to a one-time fling with an ex boyfriend.  I had evidence but not proof that the affair had been on-going for several years, but she lied and gaslighted me.  Eventually, she admitted to cheating on me with the same ex-boyfriend for almost 10 years.  \n\nI now suspect that she cheated on me the entirety of our relationship with many different men.  About a month after we dated, she had an out-of-town visitor who was a guy.  I always got the vibe that they had been intimate, although she always denied that.  A few years ago, she went out one night and we had sex in the morning.  When I performed oral sex on her, she tasted like latex.  I am suspicious that I am not the biological child of one or more of my kids, although I will wait until after the divorce for paternity tests because biology or not... I am the father of these children.\n\nAfter I found out about her affair, I slipped into clinical depression.  She, of course, started the narrative that I had always had depression and blamed her infidelity on me and my depression.  I recently obtained the notes from our marriage counselor and she literally states that she would not have another affair as long as I made sure that our marriage was strong.\n\nA few months after I found out about her affair, we had an argument and she suggested that I should just kill myself.  This literally triggered me to have a suicide attempt (the suicide attempt is my responsibility... I'm not blaming her), for which I ended up in the mental hospital for a couple of weeks.  She spoke to the doctors at the mental hospital and made up all sorts of crazy stories about me, such that the hospital's psychiatrist concluded that I was paranoid (is it paranoia if she is literally out to get me?).  She also lied about suggesting that I commit suicide, so now my medical records suggest that I am delusional.\n\nA few months after I got out of the hospital, I caught her in more lies about her infidelity and we had an argument.  The argument became heated and she panicked and started screaming, triggering one of my kids to call the police.  The police showed up and we were interviewed but I was not arrested.\n\nShe told me that night that she wanted a divorce.  We verbally agreed to have an amicable divorce because that would be easier on both us and the kids and less expensive.  We agreed to share custody of the kids and split assets evenly.  She retained a lawyer and I helped her fill out all of the legal intake information.  \n\nA few days before her lawyer filed the divorce petition with the court, I decided that I would like to have legal representation of my own.  After all, I had a substantial amount of money in my retirement account and why bother saving $5,000 or so... when my retirement was worth a lot more than that?  She yelled at me, saying that I broke my promise to her that I would go *pro se*.\n\nA couple of days later, I got the divorce petition, signed and dated prior to me letting her know that I would retain an attorney.  She requested full custody of the kids, citing my mental health problems.  She also fudged the value of various assets to make it look like a fair division of assets.  She literally overvalued items that I would receive and undervalued items that she would receive by an amount greater that $100,000.\n\nThe ironic thing, at this point, is that our relationship was still fairly good.  We were generally friendly and cordial and we coordinated the parenting of the kids per normal.  Slowly, over the next month or so, she became very spiteful when I refused to give her full custody of the kids and I told her that her valuations were completely wrong.\n\nWe eventually went to mediation, where she made numerous accusations about me.  She claimed that I have substance abuse problems because I smoke marijuana on occasion (she smoked with me).  She claimed that I was a neglectful father because I would occasionally leave our youngest child in the care of our oldest child -- this oldest child frequently babysits for other parents in our neighborhood.  She claimed that I was often angry and out of control.  She cited both my suicide attempt and the argument in which she called the police as examples of my violent temperament.  She also claimed that I was neglecting my mental health because I had stopped seeing my therapist.  Finally, she claimed that I was a neglectful father.\n\nThe good news... My Nex is not very smart or very good at lying and I am nowhere near as exciting of a person as she is making me out to be.\n\nFirst, I stopped using marijuana when we separated because I had a hunch that she would try to use that against me.  I will have no problem passing any drug test at any time, although I will require that she take a drug test with me.  \n\nSecond, I stopped seeing my therapist because we agreed that my mental health was completely solid.   I still see my psychiatrist every so often for a med check, but I am doing exceptionally well.  Both my psychiatrist and my therapist will write letters to the court saying that I have worked really hard on my mental health, that my mental health has improved substantially (i.e., back to normal), that my depression was situational, and that the primary cause of my depression was a toxic combination of Nex's emotional abuse and my co-dependency.\n\nThird, I found her old cell phone and I downloaded about 15 months of text messages between me and Nex.  About 95% of our messages were kid-related, proving that I was an involved parent.\n\nFourth, there are things known as appraisals.  We have been negotiating the values of assets. If I wanted it, her number was (in my opinion) exceptionally high and if she wanted it... her number was exceptionally low (in my opinion).  I thought that my numbers were reasonable, but perhaps somewhat in her favor.  When she refused to change her numbers, we were forced to get appraisals.  So far, the appraisals have been better than my wildest imagination.  I guessed the value of our house (which she wants) at $255,000 and she estimated it at $225,000.  It appraised for $275,000.  Yay, me!\n\nFifth, her accusation that I was violent is completely unfounded.  I am reasonably certain that she planned the argument that led to my kids calling the police.  The police showing up turns out to be a blessing in disguise.  Whereas she is claiming that I assaulted her and that the cops made me leave for the night, the police report literally states that no assault occurred.  I don't know for sure, but I am guessing that her attorney will bring this up in court, assuming that I never bothered to get the police report.\n\nFinally, she is not very good about logging out of her emails when she uses the computer in our house, so I have been able to read emails between her and her lawyer a few times.  This has been so helpful to my mental health.  Even though I know what is real from what is not, the years of gaslighting and emotional abuse always leaves a slight bit of doubt in my mind.  Reading the text messages between Nex and her lawyer in which they are actively plotting to \"get me\" proves that I am not paranoid... they are literally out to get me.  It was particularly entertaining to read their thoughts on making accusations that I was harassing her but then I went No Contact, so that went out the window.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'm a writer.\n\n**\n\nI won\u2019t get into all the details but he (37) and I (38) were friends. For about six months. Confidants. Our friendship happened quickly but I started to trust him. He was rather vulnerable with me even from the beginning: talked to me about his recent break-up. Perhaps declaring bankruptcy in his business. His mental health issues. The fact that he doesn\u2019t get to see his daughter much. Despite being rather private and secretive, I eventually started opening up to him too.\n\nOh, and we were also both into BDSM. Both Doms. He had the brand new tattoo and a real life sub to prove it. I, 20 years of dominating men.\n\nI should\u2019ve believed him when he told me he wasn\u2019t a good person. That he goes to great effort to keep the egotistical asshole hidden inside. He won't accept compliments from people--even though he needs to hear them--otherwise he'll go back to being full of himself. He must remain humble. He's had to move to a completely different town because he burned every bridge in the town he lived in before. Because he fucked pretty much every woman, married or not, in that town. I should\u2019ve believed him when he told me he does many terrible things to people. He lies, manipulates and uses people. That even if something tragic were to happen to him, he doesn\u2019t really have a good friend he could talk to. He feels no empathy. No shame. No guilt for anything he's done.\n\nBut, instead, I believed him when he told me I was the closest friend he\u2019s got. And that he cares about me.\n\nI should\u2019ve understood like I do now.\n\nHe really likes sex. I do too. He\u2019s kinky. I am too.\n\nWe trusted and respected\u2014my two chisel-them-in-stone-rules-to-get-freaky--each other so let\u2019s push some boundaries. Let\u2019s play. Let\u2019s switch. For months, we did. Online. Via WhatsApp. Live video. And even though he lives in a different European country than I do, we found ways to meet up and do it that way too.\n\nLast week, I was in his town for business. I was feeling awful after our previous time together when he dominated me and then things went to hell with his sub before he provided me with any thoughtful aftercare. Another rather long story. Nevertheless, this time, I got to have my turn to try to make up for it.\n\nI made him worship me as his Queen. We had many hours of great sex and let\u2019s just say he really took care of me that night. He stayed the night with me.\n\nWe both went about our business the next day but perhaps we\u2019d meet up that evening. We had joked that I owed him for the night before and maybe we should meet up so I can even things up a bit. He was busy working in his bar that evening but I could stop by for drinks. Nothing solid. I was busy and didn\u2019t get my act together until after 9pm to even think about going over to his bar. I messaged him telling him I was coming over for a quick one, without realizing that he closed at 10pm. He told me that it was slow so he was probably closing early so to hurry. I apologized, told him I didn\u2019t realize and I didn\u2019t want to hold him up. I\u2019d catch him for our pre-arranged coffee in the morning before I headed out of town.\n\nHe told me to come over anyway. Besides, he wanted to go get something to eat.\n\n\u201cOk, I\u2019ll hurry.\u201d I arrive about 9:30-9:45.\n\nThere were a couple of men\u2014acquaintances or friends, I suppose\u2014at the bar when I arrived. I ordered a beer. About 6.0%. Keep in mind, I\u2019m in a different country and I don\u2019t speak the language. My friend speaks near perfect English. Despite that, I tried to have a laugh with the other men at the bar. We get by.\n\nI was poured a small pour of another very strong beer. I slowly drank it.\n\nMy phone lights up. A WhatsApp message from him, from behind his bar.\n\n\u201cBJ?\u201d\n\nI smirk. \u201cYeah, sure. But I\u2019m not doing it in the fucking toilet.\u201d\n\n\u201c \u263a Behind the bar?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan do, yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you be my little whore and spread them for me too\u2026well, we\u2019ll see. I\u2019m pretty tired from last night.\u201d\n\nOne of the other men then buys a round for the three of us. I don\u2019t want it because I drove but, alas, it was served to me. It looks like I\u2019m going to be here for awhile longer now anyway.\n\nI slowly drink that too hoping that the other men will leave. I am tired, I do want my nice hotel bed and I want to get down. They don\u2019t. Feeling I should reciprocate, I buy a round. I don\u2019t remember what I was served, it was suggested for me. I don\u2019t remember drinking it. Not sure that I finished it. That\u2019s beer #3.5.\n\nI texted him:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve been fucked up together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not fucked up.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo\u2026I am. Haha\u201d\n\nThey finally leave, after midnight. About 12:15.\n\nI was drunk. Happy drunk, I think. Dancing. Red cheeks. Too drunk to drive. Been there many times before. We moved up to some couches that were situated on a raised platform and in the front window of his bar.\n\nI\u2019m struggling with the details of everything for about the next hour (I think) or so. Try as I might, it\u2019s spotty. I didn\u2019t think I drank that much but apparently something has affected my consciousness.\n\nI don\u2019t remember doing it at all but apparently I took all of my clothes off. Completely naked. He was sitting on the couch in front of me and pulled his pants down. I think I remember that I climbed on top of him and we had sex. But, again, the memory is foggy. I\u2019m not even sure that we had sex at all that night. I think we did though.\n\nI started giving him a BJ. I remember that. But I don\u2019t remember everything about it. He told me he wanted to cum in my face. I let him but that\u2019s one of the last things I remember for awhile.\n\nStill naked, on my knees with my head on his lap, I guess I fell asleep or passed out or something. His cum still on my face, he told me I had to leave. I remember mumbling something about needing to sleep for a little while and could I please sleep on one of his couches in the bar.\n\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t stay here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just need to sleep it off a bit. I\u2019m too drunk to drive.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrive back drunk, I do it all the time. You\u2019ve got to leave.\u201d\n\nI think I remember starting to cry a little bit, got off the floor and, still naked, sat next to him on the couch with my face in my hands. Humiliated. I must\u2019ve fallen asleep that way.\n\nI have no idea how long I was like that but I came to after awhile and he wasn\u2019t next to me. He had moved back behind his bar where he was drinking and smoking. It\u2019s the middle of the night but I\u2019m not sure what time. 2am maybe?\n\nWhen he noticed I was awake he started yelling at me how he was totally done with my shit. The tears. The crying. I needed to get out now. 100% done with me. I need to leave.\n\nI quickly threw my clothes back on pleading with him to explain what he was talking about and that I couldn\u2019t leave just yet. I begged him to explain to me what was going on. I told him I didn\u2019t understand. Wasn\u2019t I just asleep? Please tell me what I did? What did I say?\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t tell me. Told me he was done with me and to get the fuck out of his bar. I pleaded with him to talk to me like a human. Still. Cold as ice.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand. What happened? I\u2019ve still got your cum drying on my face. What the fuck?? I can\u2019t drive, I\u2019m too drunk.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to get out of my bar now.\u201d He throws me a card with a taxi number on it.\n\nI start retching a little bit. Feel like I\u2019m going to puke. I feel dirty, used, contaminated. Discarded. Shame. So confused.\n\n\u201cOh god. Don\u2019t fucking puke in here. Do you want my sympathy or something? Not gonna get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, I just don\u2019t understand. And I don\u2019t have enough cash on me for a taxi and I don\u2019t speak (your language.)\u201d\n\n\u201cI jizzed in your face. So what? Get out of my bar.\u201d\n\nHe knew full well that I found that to be a degrading act and it was a big stretch for me to let him do it. I was sucker punched when he said it.\n\nMy jaw dropped: \u201cYou\u2019re a piece of shit.\u201d\n\nNow he lost it. Started aggressively yelling at me to get the fuck out of his bar and how he never wanted to see me again. To insult him in his own bar?! Wouldn\u2019t stop so I said, fine. Let me out.\n\nHe grabbed his keys and walked to the doors so he could unlock it to let me out. I followed behind him. It was two doors. I stood in the interior doorframe waiting for him to unlock the exterior door. It was a tight space but I expected him to unlock the door, open it, see me out and then lock it behind me.\n\nHowever, he just unlocked it and then turned directly around. I wasn\u2019t expecting that so I was just standing there. I hesitated for a second not knowing where to go. He took both of his hands, shoved me into the door and told me to get the fuck out as he pushed himself past me.\n\nNow I was pissed. Yelling at him how he just put his hands on me and got physical with me for no reason. He steps to me. I step right back up telling him to get the fuck out of my face. (I\u2019m a military veteran and have a good bit of training in, well, how to get people the fuck out of my face.)\n\nHe walks away, back behind the bar somewhere.\n\nI sit on the little steps that were right behind me (the ones that led up to the platform we were on earlier) and sobbed. Begging him to tell me what\u2019s going on. He won\u2019t.\n\n\u201cFine, then I\u2019ll just go sleep it off in my car.\u201d\n\n\u201cNope. Not in my parking lot.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m stuck. It\u2019s the middle of the night. I\u2019m drunk. I can\u2019t stay in the bar, I can\u2019t sleep in my car in his lot. I can\u2019t drive. I have no money for a taxi and even if I did, I couldn\u2019t communicate well enough to have someone come get me.\n\nI\u2019m utterly flabbergasted. No idea how any of this happened or why. He is proving me right\u2014he is a piece of shit\u2014anyway.\n\nWith his cum still dried on my face, I give up. Fine. I\u2019ll go. I grab my purse, my jacket.\n\nBut I can\u2019t find my phone. My phone that will help me get back to where I\u2019m staying. My phone that is the only way I know how to get back to the country where I live.\n\n\u201cI need you to help me find my phone.\u201d\n\nHe accuses me of hiding it in some random drawers behind his bar.

He tells me he\u2019s going to call the cops to get me out of here.\n\n\u201cJust help me find my phone or give me a little bit to fucking find it.\u201d\n\nHe starts texting people, telling me I\u2019ve just made things really bad for myself. That he knows cops. That I don\u2019t know how things work in (his country.)\n\n\u201cJust help me find my motherfucking phone. I can\u2019t go anywhere without it and you know that. Help me find it and I\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\nHe makes a phone call. In his language. I understand nothing. \u201cMay as well wait, they\u2019ll be here shortly. You just made things very bad for yourself.\u201d\n\nSo I cross my arms and wait. He\u2019s told the cops, apparently, that I\u2019m unwanted here after hours. Didn\u2019t matter that I was here after hours at your invitation so you could fuck me, apparently. Didn\u2019t matter that you kept serving me, as a bartender. And then\u2014even as a friend\u2014showed no concern how I got home. Told me to drive drunk. I was the one completely in the wrong.\n\nThe cops arrive. Three of them. They\u2019re all tall and speak to him in their language. They look to me.\n\n\u201cShe speaks English.\u201d The first helpful thing he\u2019s done for me since he served my last drink for me.\n\nI explain. I want to go, but I can\u2019t. I need my phone. I tell them we\u2019re friends. Or, at least we were. They seemed surprised at that. Thought I was just some random.\n\nI wanted to tell them that he pushed me. That he was just fucking me. That I have his cum still on my face. But I just want to get out of there. They go back to speaking in their language together so I just keep my mouth shut. One of the cops is looking for my phone up on the platform for me.\n\nHe finds it. Under a little chair that had a skirt on it that went to the floor. It must\u2019ve fallen out of my purse when I was sitting next to it while on the stairs. I don\u2019t think I put it in its little pocket right. Maybe. That happens sometimes.\n\nThey ask if I\u2019m ok to drive. Of course not.\n\nThey ask where I\u2019m staying. In a hotel in the next town. By some stroke of luck adjacent to their station. They\u2019ll give me a ride.\n\nHe thanks the cops for their help as they escort me out the door. I steal a look over my shoulder in the hopes of one last glance but he looks away. That\u2019s it. The last time I\u2019ll ever see him or talk to him. Or at least he better hope so.\n\nHe has no use for me anymore. He got to dominate me, let me dominate him and then got one last BJ. His sub is moving in, apparently so now I\u2019m worthless to him. Doesn\u2019t even need me as a friend. Let alone a human. I hate myself for how stupid and trusting and na\u00efve I was.\n\nI picked up my car the next morning and didn\u2019t stop until I crossed the border. Fuck that whole country. I pulled over the first chance I got.\n\n\u201cHave a nice life,\u201d I messaged. Then I proceeded to block and delete his entire existence.\n\nBut not before saving some very compromising videos.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Two weeks with no contact. 5 days full NC.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*I went through the three stages of narcissistic modus operandi: idealization, devaluation by silent treatment and finally the discard. It was very intense and fast. I did not get what I wanted, not a bit, but I felt sucked dry very fast and it was a lot to take in after all was over. I just knew things were over reading books and looking through forums. I found the term narcissistic abuse and my ex was every other ex in the forums. I was shocked, destroyed to my core and so suddenly, I understood why and how they act.*\n\n**The Frustration**\n\nI thought we had a chance and that we were meant to be, mind you, I am not stupid, I knew it would take time and hard work. I was down to do the work; I thought we would fight the difficulties together. After I found about narcissism my frustration was overwhelming. Then I knew it was over, and that I needed NC right away. **Narcissists do not change**. Even if she went back begging to me, even so, it would be just part of the pull and push dynamics. She never did that tough. For a time I wished she had. Sometimes I still do.\n\n**The Negation**\n\nI tried so hard to see I was the problem so I could solve it and make my ex happy. To love her and to be there for her every day. I was going to work hard to help her with her bills and I was going to work even harder to get a good place to live with her and to give her peace. \u201cOk, maybe she is not a narcissist, maybe she just made a mistake.\u201d I prayed every single day for it: God, help me please, send her back, and make her understand I love her. However, the more I read, the more I knew she was a textbook histrionic narcissist. She goes to therapy and has the vocabulary of a victim. It is taking time to accept she is not the victim this time. It is even harder to understand that I am a victim and I need to take care of myself.\n\n**I was blind and now I unfortunately see**\n\nI cry quite a lot and have a terrible headache all the time. I feel sick and I am drowning in debt. I was blind to the manipulative, narcissistic cult and that many in my close family were part of that too. My mother suffers from BPD, I think. She destroyed me as a child making me feel responsible for her feelings and the disgrace her life was. My father does not stay behind. Actually, he was very violent with her and she took it off on me every time.\n\nI was sexually abused at the age of 5 and 13. The first time I was abused by a 16 years old neighbor and after that by my mother\u2019s male friend of 40 when I was 13.\n\nMy parents never took care of me as they did with my siblings. Yet, they screwed my siblings too, big time. Now I see who the mother of my mother is. She is a full-blown narcissist and my mother is her victim. My mother is manipulative and says if she dies etc it is all my fault because I blame her for everything. Well, I told her to go to see a doctor and stop caring about her brothers\u2019s lives. They not even care for my mother. She thinks this is blaming her for everything.\n\nMy mother can never come to the hospital to help me, but she can do it for her extended family. My family sucked part of my savings money, my ex took advantage of the rest of it and in a blink of an eye all I had was over. I do not even know how to pay for therapy tomorrow. I do not blame them for this, it was my fault entirely. It is still hard to see that no one you thought loved you really do. I am alone.\n\nNow I am stuck in hell with my mother and her mother. We are living together, I came to help them, and now I have nothing. I am sick, and I do not have anyone to take care of me. It does not really make any difference. Since my childhood, I have to take care of myself. The last bit I know is good for me now, but to take care of myself as a child made a big hole in my mind and soul.\n\n**I miss her**\n\nSometimes I miss my ex so much. I wish I was dead, but if I could only kiss her, had her in my arms one more time. If I could have my money back and rent a place. If I could die. If, if, if\u2026\n\nThere is no closure. My ex did not even tried to talk things out with me. She did not even bother to lie to me, to say she loved me or something. Even lying to me was to much effort for her.

He escalated to physical violence after years of emotional abuse and gaslighting.  I\u2019m still proud of myself for standing up for myself that day and pressing charges and not backing down in the face of his threats.  I shudder to think what my life would be like had I chosen to stay.  Thanks to the local sheriffs department, the domestic violence center, and my loving family, I was able to make the trek cross country from California back to my home state of Mississippi.  Despite the circumstances, that was probably one of the best road trips I\u2019ve ever had.  It was just so....liberating.  For the first time in 5 years, I had no one to answer to.  I didn\u2019t need to ask permission to walk downstairs or what to get for dinner.  I had been on the road for about a day and a half and I stopped in Elko, NV for the night.  I remember sitting in my motel room with my pets, feeling a bit stir crazy.  Like most places in Nevada, there was a casino a block down the road from my motel where I was staying.  So I stood up, got dressed, put $20 in my pocket, and walked by myself (at night!) to the casino.  The first thing I did was go to the bar and I ordered myself a cranberry vodka (Nex never allowed drinking of any alcohol whatsoever).  And I sat there at the bar and I sipped my drink and people watched for about an hour.  I\u2019ll never forget the happiness I felt in that very moment.  The relief of knowing that my phone wouldn\u2019t be blowing up with 50 text messages per minute...\u201dWhere are you?  Who are you with?  Who are you fucking behind my back?  You better answer me!\u201d  I ordered another drink and farted around the casino for a few hours and lost my whole $20 on video slot machines.....it was so much damn fun.  Then I went to the 24 hour diner they had and ordered waffles and a mimosa and flirted a bit with the cute waiter.  Zero guilt.  I walked back to my motel room and slept better than I had in years.  \n\nI made it home to my my parents a few days later.  We hugged and cried and hugged some more.  My dad had made my favorite dinner (fried catfish and potatoes).  I ate and ate and ate.  I finally had an appetite.  \n\nThe next few weeks are kind of a blur.  The day I got home to my parents, I got the phone call from the jail that my Nex had been bailed out.  A day or so later he harassing texts and phone calls started.  I have a no contact criminal protective order against him, but we all know that means crap to a true narcissist.  So we\u2019d just block whatever number he was contacting us from and go about our lives.\n\nI got back on Facebook after years of not being allowed to, and reconnected with some old friends.  I went to a cousin reunion and got to see family members I had been cut off from for the past 5 years.  A guy I had known in elementary school (we\u2019ll call him Bob) messaged me one evening to see if I wanted to go out for drinks.  I politely declined and he was nice about it, said maybe another time.  About a month went by and he messaged me again...\u201dSo about that beer?\u201d  He didn\u2019t live too far from where I was staying, it was late summer, I was hot and bored and tired of sitting in the mosquitos by myself, so I said \u201cSure, why not?\u201d  So on September 7, 2018, I drove to his house.  His little dog greeted me in the driveway and Bob offered me a cold beer.  He was working in his garage so we sat in there until it got dark and just caught up on each other.  He asked where I had  been and what brought me back home.  I was completely honest and spared no small details.  I\u2019ll never forget the look in his eyes as I told him what had happened.  Anyone who\u2019s been with a narc knows what it\u2019s like to look into their eyes.  It\u2019s not like looking into a fellow human, more like staring into the eyes of a predator, one who is slowly sizing up his next victim, planning his next move....their cold, emotionless, almost dead at times.   But as I looked into Bob\u2019s eyes that night, going over everything that happened to me...I saw genuine concern, sorrow, maybe a touch of anger.  When we would share something funny, his laugh would light up his entire face, and his eyes sparkled with joy.  It\u2019s probably no surprise what happened later that night.  I know some people say that it\u2019s best to wait after a traumatic breakup before you sleep with someone else....but I\u2019m a 33 year old woman who had been sexually starved for over 5 years.  I didn\u2019t want to wait.  We were sitting on the couch in his living room and I was talking about something....he looked at me and asked, \u201cCan I kiss you?\u201d  I said yes.  I don\u2019t think I realized up until that night just how much I had been craving physical affection.  A narc will have sex with you, but there\u2019s never any true love or real emotion involved.  I\u2019ll spare the details for lack of turning this into a romance novel, but I ended up spending the night.  \n\nWe hung out a lot after that....going to the lake, going fishing, hanging out with old friends.  One night in particular stands out in my mind.  We were hanging out with some old high school friends, we were all a bit drunk.  Some old rap song came over the radio and two of the girls grabbed me and we started dirty dancing in the middle of the kitchen.  About half way through, the panic struck my mind....\u201dOh god what am I doing???  I\u2019m probably embarrassing him!  He\u2019s going to be so mad...\u201d I look over at him standing in the corner, expecting to see anger and disappointment on his face...instead he looks at me, laughs, and jumps in and starts dancing with me, like the biggest dork I\u2019d ever seen.  He hugged me later that night and asked if I was having fun.  I said I was and he said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad...you deserve to have all the fun.\u201d\n\nThis is where my story takes a huge turn out of left field.  It could be a good or bad turn....depending on how you look at it.  One thing about me...I\u2019ve always wanted children.  I think this is one of the ways my Nex kept me for so long.  He knew and used it as a reason to get married (he didn\u2019t want his kids growing up with unmarried parents).  Of course after we got married things just got worse and worse.  But every month I prayed for a child...tracked my ovulation, tried my best to get him to have sex on my fertile days...I tried for over a year and all I got was a pile of negative pregnancy tests.  I remember crying and praying to God every night, but looking back, I realize he was answering my prayers...I just didn\u2019t realize it at the time.  Bob and I practiced safe sex....or we thought we did.  On October 15, I had a funny feeling and took a home pregnancy test.  I really expected it to be negative.  I\u2019ll never forget the shock I felt as that ever so faint but very much there, second pink line showed up.  I kind of laughed and sobbed, looked up and yelled \u201cREALLY GOD???  ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME??  NOW????  REALLY?!!!\u201d\n\nSo I took about a hundred more tests....just to be sure.  And they all said the same thing....I was pregnant.  I knew I had to tell Bob.  I just didn\u2019t know how...we had barely been seeing each other for a month.  After a few days, I finally got the nerve up and drove over to see him.  He told me later that he could tell as soon as I got out of my truck that something was up.  He said when he hugged me, I was shaking so hard.  He thought I had come over to break things off, maybe I had met someone else.  I remember sitting on his couch, holding the beer he gave me that I wouldn\u2019t drink, my leg bouncing and shaking so hard.....\u201dI have to tell you something.  But I just want you to know that I expect absolutely NOTHING from you.  I don\u2019t want anything and if you want me to, I\u2019ll go away and you\u2019ll never have to hear from me again.\u201d  The whole time he\u2019s just staring at me like \u201cWTF is this crazy woman going on about??\u201d\nI took a deep breath and said it.  \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d  He looked at me, looked down at the floor, looked back up at me with tears in his eyes... \n\u201cIs it mine?\u201d\nI laughed and said well yeah...you\u2019re kind of the only guy I\u2019ve been with since I got back home.  Then he leaned over and wrapped me up in the biggest hug he\u2019d ever given me.  \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be ok, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s been ok.  Both of our families have been super supportive, he\u2019s been amazing.  He\u2019s been working his ass off at his job as a plumber to take care of us.  I started my own little side business cleaning houses, but the farther along I\u2019ve gotten in my pregnancy the harder it\u2019s been to work.  He\u2019s been awesome though....he cooks for me, helps around the house, all the little things.  We found out on December 31 that we\u2019re having a little girl, she\u2019s due June 24, 2019.  \n\nOf course despite my best efforts to keep this happy news to ourselves and family and close friends...my Nex still pops up in my inbox from time to time.  Even though there\u2019s a warrant out for his arrest (he failed to appear in court and skipped out on bail) he\u2019s somehow managed to make it here, close to where I\u2019m staying.  He message me a few weeks ago \u201ccongratulating\u201d me on my pregnancy....calling me a slut, saying if all I wanted was a sperm donor, then why did I waste his time?  And he\u2019s\nstill going to find me and make me pay for what I did to him.  Blah blah blah.  I just screenshot every threat, email it to the DA, and block him.  \n\nSo yeah....that\u2019s my latest update...not really what I was planning on telling y\u2019all months ago, but life is funny like that.  Part of me was hesitant to post it, because I didn\u2019t want anyone thinking that I was being stupid and vulnerable.  I still have bad days where I feel sad and angry at myself for what happened to me...but they don\u2019t last for long.  I don\u2019t feel particularly vulnerable or like I\u2019m an easy target anymore.  I don\u2019t really regret anything that\u2019s gotten me to where I am right now.  It\u2019s like my dad said when I told him I was pregnant....\u201dEverything happens for a reason...mostly when you least expect it.\u201d  Every time I feel my little girl move and kick inside of me, I\u2019m so grateful that things happened the way they did.  I\u2019m so grateful that I didn\u2019t have a child with that monster.  Even if things don\u2019t work out in the long run with me and Bob, I\u2019m grateful she\u2019ll have such a caring and loving man as her father.  I\u2019m a human and I\u2019ve lived my life how I wanted and I don\u2019t and I won\u2019t feel sorry for it.  And maybe that\u2019s one reason I wanted to post this.  I know as victims, we\u2019re often scared to leave, to strike out on our own because of so many \u201cwhat if\u2019s\u201d.  But I\u2019m here to say that it\u2019s going to be ok.  You WILL fuck up and make mistakes...some really big ones.  But don\u2019t let that deter you from fighting for yourself.  Sometimes mistakes turn into blessings you never saw coming.  Don\u2019t be scared to have fun, don\u2019t be scared to open yourself to others, don\u2019t be scared to take that chance, and mostly, don\u2019t be scared to allow yourself to love again.  I know there are plenty of demons in this world, we\u2019ve slept with them, but there are also a lot of really good people, including yourself.   You\u2019re a good person and you deserve true love and happiness.\n\nSo that\u2019s what\u2019s been going in my life for the past 246 days since I left.  I\u2019m so grateful I found this sub over a year ago and my eyes opened and I realized that I wasn\u2019t the crazy one.  Otherwise I very likely would still be stuck in the hell that was life with my Nex.  \n\nStay strong.  Never give up hope.  We\u2019re all rooting for you. \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc9a\n\n-TresLilBirds\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

[long-ish post]", "author": "throwaway_a1b2c3d4e5", "self_text": "Hello all,\n\nI\u2019ve been following this sub for a while now on my account (posting with a throwaway) and I have to say this community has really helped me through my healing journey. Just putting it out there I do see a therapist regularly and it has helped a lot to some degree as well. \n\nSo to bring light to my story, my ex and I have been broken up for 8 months now. He\u2019s in a relationship (started dating her two weeks after leaving me) and says he\u2019s in love. \n\nPart of me is happy for him but the other part of me is having trouble not doubting myself.  This mostly comes from the last few interactions we\u2019ve had. One of the last times I spoke with him he spent about 2 hours just yelling at me about how I\u2019m manipulating him by not moving or signing a new lease on my own for our old apt we shared (it\u2019s a long story but I still live in our old apt, he is not paying any rent or utilities, I pay everything, but his name is still on the lease. I don\u2019t have a guarantor, couldn\u2019t find a place I could afford on my own mostly because he left me with all our furniture so I opted to stay). No matter what I said to tell him I\u2019m not manipulating him he just put me in a tough spot and I\u2019m doing the best I can, he kept saying my best isn\u2019t good enough.  I can\u2019t remember the rest of the details... honestly I just sat there. The worst part of this whole thing was when he said to me that I used to think you were one of the good people in this world but you aren\u2019t. You are a bad person. I cried all night after he said that to me.... it shook me to my core to hear that from someone that used to love me and a part of me still loved...\n\nThe very next day (I\u2019m not kidding it was the next morning) he asked to talk to me again. He apologized for being angry and for what he said...  he said I was an amazing person, crying to me saying that I taught him what unconditional love was... no one had ever given that to him before and I was one of the most beautiful people in his life. That he was sorry I was going through so much (I was recently diagnosed with a chronic disease) and he wanted nothing more than for me to be happy.\n\nSo a month goes by, and I meet up with him again to try and negotiate some lease stuff. During this month we had minimal contact. I honestly thought things were finally just ok?\nBut then at our meeting, the landlord didn\u2019t show and I was 5 mins late (I told him the day before I would be late mind you. I was coming from work and could not get off early). He then started yelling at me that I was disrespectful being 5 mins late and just went on an angry rant. This time though, I tried to stand up for myself and said I didn\u2019t deserve to be talked to like that. That made things worse and no matter what I did to try and reassure him that I\u2019m not manipulating that I\u2019m literally just trying to have peace with him... it just fell on deaf angry ears. \n\nThat encounter ended with him finally calming down and him saying \u201cthanks for waiting for me to calm down I\u2019m sorry I got so mad\u201d.... but then I made a mistake and asked him if he meant what he said when he was yelling that I\u2019m a horrible person... and he said the one sentence that is still haunting me... he said \u201cyou mistreated me throughout our relationship. You will mistreat everyone you are with and the new guy you end up with... I feel sorry for him.\u201d \n\nIt just... hurts to think that someone who claimed to have loved me can not have a clear opinion of me... to flip flop constantly and say such things. Frankly it shook me. I\u2019ve found myself questioning if I am a shitty girlfriend and a person and that maybe I was the unhealthy one? I\u2019m finding it so so hard to date and get close to guys when all I can think about are his words. I don\u2019t want to hurt anyone....\n\nSo my close friends and family (the only select few I\u2019ve shared the details of our relationship with) have all said that he was emotionally abusive in our relationship and that him saying this stuff to me was just another tactic. That\u2019s fine..., I\u2019m not sure what to think to be honest...\n\nMy question is how do I move past this and what steps have helped some of you to overcome the words that were said to you? \n\nI\u2019ve done a lot for myself over the months and genuinely feel so incredibly free and so much happier... I just feel now this is coming up because I\u2019ve met someone that I really like I\u2019m just terrified of getting close to him. \n\nI\u2019m all ears \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

She started adding all the old sources of supply and the ones I would mention years ago because they were all clearly in to her and she would use them to triangulate me. She then posted a meme directly aimed at me to insult me hoping I would retaliate and contact her. The 5th she sent me an email telling me her mom had lung cancer and she wanted to tell me as I knew her mom but in reality I hardly did. I believe it was another attempt to get me to speak.

Don't be baited by pathetic hoover attempts where the nex portrays himself/herself as alone, suicidal, heartbroken, devastated. More than likely they're happy as could be, sending out these poisonous messages to you as an afterthought. \n\nI lurk on this sub and other narc abuse forums. I've never made an account but I felt I had to, to warn others who may be vulnerable like me.\n\nI fell for it. After months and months and months of NC, I heard from flying monkeys about how the nex was suicidal, miserable, depressed, alone, these were the stories he was telling. The occasions where I indulged in social media stalking, I'd see grim text posts like \"every day is a struggle\", being lonely, the neverending heartbreak, etc... you get the idea. I stayed strong. Until a week ago, when a friend forwarded me an email the nex had sent him. \"Hope (my name) is okay, I just want her to be happy even though I'll never forget her, never stop loving her, and cherish our time together for the rest of my life. I lose myself every minute of every day that she's gone..\" it goes on for a while but you get the point.\n\nI reached out to him from an email account I made for the purpose. I wanted to give him closure since of course this didn't happen as Id left him the only way you can leave a Narc, vanishing. He doesn't have any of my details anymore. Of course, he told me how happy he was to hear from me and how much he missed me. I broke down and gave him my number. We talked for a few days and he kept having to disappear, put me on hold or hang up. Heard him making plans constantly, telling me he had this dinner to go to or that club to meet friends at or this new girl who I'd \"totally love\" to meet. He started getting evasive as soon as I started asking what he'd been up to since I went NC... Especially since he kept insisting we reconcile. \"Nothing! I've been all alone depressed by myself!\" until I kept pushing it and he finally snapped. \"Yeah okay you should be happy for me, I have new wome- new friends I mean in my life what's the problem? Anyway when you come back to me again you'll see, they're JUST friends and you overreact like always.'\n\nThe same lines as before. The same blatant lies about \"friends\", almost all of whom turned out to be either exes or women he was cheating on me with. I asked him if he got anything out of sending all these false projections. He told me \"I wasn't even really thinking about it - I was just pissed you disappeared on me, wanted to see if you'd reply eventually - and you did! I knew you wouldn't reach out if I shared I was with other women, obviously.\" Then, the old ultimatum everytime he discarded me: \"you better come back to me soon because I have a lot of girls lining up to be with me. So hurry up.\" I blocked him.\n\nI've spent months feeling sorry for him. The whole projection was a ruse, a trick. Since I spoke to him and changed my number again, he overhauled his social media. No more posts about depression, heartbreak. All about moving forward and \"the joy of having a new love\". \n\nThese people are sick, they're monsters pure and simple. He spent not just a few months but almost a full year putting this on just for my benefit. He \"won\" I caved. Please, those of you in NC no matter where you are don't believe it. Don't ever believe the sob story. They're texting you from a new supply's bed, hiding the message and deleting it and forgetting it as soon as it's out.

Four months later, I'm a new me. I worked on my self, found the strength that he took from me. I'm happy on my own. Coincidentally enough, without trying, I met someone recently.

The narcissist is manipulating your emotions for their own gain, and they don't actually care about you or your well-being at all. But what's even more creepy is that they're basically trying to force you to capitulate to them. A narcissist who is lovebombing you is essentially trying to brainwash you. They're trying to get you to lower your guard and throw your common sense out the window. They come at you so emotionally forcefully that it's like you don't even have the chance to think. You get so swept up in the intensity of it all that you lose yourself, and give in to what they want for you. \n\nReally it's coercion. And given that what's on the other side of the lovebombing, for the target, is so polar opposite of what it seemed to be on the surface, that makes it all the more insidious.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I find myself in the most miserable situation I've been in.  I'm in a small, shitty rental room till the end of the month and anguish is consuming me.\n\nAround 4 years ago I was cleaning up my act and wanted to stop doing drugs and stop relating to people that were very toxic and got injured on the way out.\n\nI used to have lots of company. I had my school friends, and my music band friends who were heavy into drugs and just plain irresponsible, I knew most of them over 20 years.\n\nI'll try to make it short. 3 years ago somebody's girlfriend lied to me and manipulated me into thinking I was going to be her friend or maybe boyfriend someday despite the fact she was dating somebody from my childhood for a good 8 years and I hated his guts. I try to play it cool but she drove me nuts with push pull and silent treatment maneuvers. I end up confessing my feelings  over text under drugs, which although not spoken out loud, she knew. After knowing her 8 years she flip flopped on me, said I was crazy and was never anything other than a friend to the couple when she would come home alone and bash her boyfriend behind his back at my house and flirt and be touchy with me. \n\nSo she blames me, disses me, blocks me away, unfriends me. I take the hit and take refuge in my healthy school friends company. Later she starts invading that and turf and I'm so broken up that I don't even react in the face of old friends falling for her nice side and befriending her when I want distance or a fucking apology and make peace, but she didn't let me. Etc, etc. I end up having to retreat because nobody gives a shit if she was abusive with me, even when I have come to know from a direct source she was diagnosed as a codependent and her boyfriend, my old friend, a borderline.\n\nAll this shit, plus working my ass off, panic attacks, adjusting to harsh change boiled me up to the point where I just told all of them to go fuck themselves after I had left the scene for good cause and not one of my old friends could pick up the phone to wish me a happy fucking birthday or ask how I'm doing.\n\nSo I lost every friend I ever had pretty much save some superficial contacts here and there. My family sucks and was always dysfunctional and not supportive. I ended up selling my house and moving away and I'm having trouble dealing with the amount of rage and hatred I'm feeling for this girl who fucked up my life while I was down.\n\n I've been trying to put my life back together ever since emotionally speaking, but I haven't been able to create any meaningful connections that don't just fizzle after a while, and I'm alone. My energies are dwindling and I don't know how to act anymore because everything is boring and depressing as hell in this state.\n\nWhat I want most right now is somebody to love, closure that doesn't involve hatred cause I hate feeling hatred, and revenge on that bitch or some explanation.

A brief back story (I\u2019ll try to be brief but I could write a book!). Almost 22 years together. We met in high school. I was 16 he was 17. At 18/19 we had a baby just a year after high school.  Throughout the years he put in very little effort. Spent most of his time playing video games. I did about 90% of the domestic chores and eventually I was paying about 75% of the bills. On a good week he got 30 hours in at work but most weeks he\u2019d work about 20-25 hours. When I would complain about his lack of effort, neglect and gaming addiction it always ended up with him basically saying he didn\u2019t bother because I didn\u2019t sleep with him enough. (Most of the time it was at least once a week because any longer and he would get really mean).When I explained how his neglect wasn\u2019t promoting those feelings in me he would somehow convince me there was something wrong with me sexually. That having domestic issues shouldn\u2019t affect my desire for him. So I\u2019d end up crying not knowing what was wrong with me and apologizing for making him feel undesired. I also had issues with his treatment of me around other women and his behavior around other women. He would never introduce me. When I complained he would tell me  I was an adult and could introduce myself. When I explained it made me feel unimportant and that it gave the impression to others that I wasn\u2019t important and that it\u2019s the polite thing to do, he would tell me manners are a waste of time. Over the years he has pointed out other women he sees that he finds attractive and say things like \u201cI\u2019d bang her!\u201d He has given my things to his friends girlfriends without even asking me on a couple of occasions. He has run into women he knows and introduced our daughter without introducing me even when I\u2019m standing right there. I\u2019ve found tons of porn. He has intentionally mislead me about one women before telling me she was much older then she really was. This and much more has lead me to make numerous accusations of infidelity. None of which I\u2019ve been able to confirm or deny. Just feeling like something is off. I\u2019ve only confronted two of my suspicions and both have denied it. Yet I keep thinking I\u2019m being cheated on. (This is where I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m the narcissist and maybe he\u2019s just entitled and careless?) I\u2019ve told him that his lack of effort and disrespectful behavior has not built trust in me for him but he insists I should be able to trust him with other women because he\u2019s \u201cnever cheated\u201d. My argument is that if I know he disrespects me in every other area of this relationship how can I trust him in the one area where all I have is his word to go on? Especially since he\u2019s never respected my feelings concerning his behavior with other women. He says this is crazy and that not doing chores or working enough shouldn\u2019t affect my trust about faithfulness. There have been four major accusations from me with a few minor ones thrown in as well. (The minor ones I didn\u2019t really think were cheating but his refusal to admit the things that did happen would bother him if it was me doing it escalated the situation to me accusing him but letting it go after a few days of fighting). The last big accusation of infidelity feels different from the others. Though I have no hard evidence, there are mountains of circumstantial evidence from lies to missing condoms to changes in his behavior. Did I mention the female is the known neighborhood whore? That doesn\u2019t help my suspicions. He claims I\u2019m the stereotypical loud, jealous Italian female and I\u2019m just crazy. I can\u2019t believe a word out of his mouth though. He has tried to convince me during this latest accusation that \u201cwords speak louder than actions\u201d, I can\u2019t say someone is disrespecting me because that would be speaking to someone\u2019s intent and if their intent isn\u2019t to disrespect, then it\u2019s not disrespect. He uses the same argument when I complain about how hurtful his neglect is. Allowing myself to feel hurt means I think he does it to hurt me and that\u2019s not his intent so being hurt means Im speaking to his intent and he\u2019s doing it to hurt me! There\u2019s so many other details and nonsense but that\u2019s the gist of the situation. So my question is, am I a narcissist for always thinking he\u2019s cheating on me even when two of my suspicions have been denied by the \u201cother\u201d woman? Am I abusing him by not trusting in him when I\u2019ve never found undeniable evidence of cheating? I know the missing condom is a pretty good indicator but I\u2019m only about 95% sure one went missing. I was keeping track (jealous me) and we had got a new box recently that had a bonus one that was a new kind and I was excited to try it. It disappeared. But I could be wrong. I don\u2019t think I am but I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s up from down right now so I don\u2019t fully trust myself. Anyways, I recognize his gas lighting and abuse for what it is but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m toxic too! Am I justified in not trusting him? At this point I know I\u2019m crazy but am I abusing him with accusations of infidelity if he\u2019s innocent? Am I just a crazy jealous loud Italian stereotype? ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

(Sorry fellow redditer I haven't used your name)\n\nI just don't know how slow is slow...\n\n22 days ago, I (30) met his guy(34) on tinder... I  have been on 4 dates. Almost every weekend since. Last date was an impromptu breakfast. He was near my work, asked me for breakfast. \nI was on my way to work. I called in work to say I'll be late by an hr. I went for breakfast although I don't even eat heavy breakfast in the morn. ( \ud83d\ude15 earlier I wouldn't have even noticed it).\n\nNow I'm not sure if I should have passed it off and said no.

And he hurt his gf in the past and it still haunts him. Since I am not up for anything casual we can't be doing anything except be friends. I worry he didn't say no sex. He said no relationships. I don't want one without other. \n\nBut we msg each other atleast twice a day? He calls me friend. (N used that too even when we were intimate in every way). I get a feeling friend is a euphemism.\n\nThis week he offered to drive me home from work, he made a comment about charging me. Although I did decline, I recall N used similar phrases too. (You owe me this, you owe me that) Then I laughed it off, but now its given me pause. N use affection and actions as transactional tokens... is he showing himself up?\n\nHe has asked to meet up again before I go for vacation...I don't know. \n\nOther similarities, mentions his physical appearance deprecating way(not true), (corrected me about saying he was lean to say its better athletic), a bit defensive about himself even jokingly but no rage yet. \n\nMain differences from N is he is easy to talk to, smiles quickly, is noticeably considerate.\n\n But it could be love bombing. \n\nNow I confused if I'm being overly anxious  or overthinking! \n\nEDIT: Thank you for your comments. \n\nWriting down this post simply shows me how riddled with my issues the experience has been.\nGot a long way to go. \n\nEach of your responses are distinctly different but they point in the same direction.

Then othertimes the bad memories won't stop bugging me. I need to get it off my chest. Posted elsewhere but didn't get much of a response. Would love some advice from people who are equipped to deal with this sorta thing.\n\nWarning: Quite a long read but I'd really appreciate it if you have the time to go through it.\n\nYears ago, the memories just served to reinforce my shame and humiliation. Now that I'm an adult, they reinforce my anger.\n\nBefore I continue I must say that above all: I hate useless people in positions of responsibility. Useless terrible people who's only fucking job was to ensure the wellbeing of a child. So fucking easy. And they couldn't even do that.\n\nMy parents are awesome. Fantastic. Without them, I'd be dead or a full-on drug addict.\n\nThe teacher I had in school, when I was about 7 years old, was not fantastic. In fact, he was the worst person I've ever met in my life.\n\nIt's funny. I only recently found out that what happened to me occurred when I was that age. I assumed, because of the nature of the trauma, I was older when it happened. And I've read that the mind and memories have a way of getting blurry around trauma such as this.\n\nAnyway. I moved to a new school when I was about 7ish. First year was okay. Mild bullying. Nothing physical, just the usual taunts. Could deal with it. Made friends.\n\nThe second year, things went very bad. Not sure how it developed into this. Started off slow but progressed really quickly into something terrible. To cut a long story short, the worst of it was when a large group of classmates (at least 7 or 8 males, same age) would chase me across the playing fields, and upon catching me, the leader of these people would grab me from the back, hold me and rub his groin into my bottom (I'm male btw) while talking about raping me. This happened routinely. \n\nUntil very recently, I didn't realise that the term for this is molestation.\n\nAt the time, I tried to tell my teacher, my parents about the bullying. I told them I was being bullied but I couldn't find the words to describe the extent of what was happening. I don't even know now what words I would use. We weren't educated about this properly. \n\nThe teacher made it out as if I was talking shit, that my non-specific 'bullying' was make-believe. My grades dropped and I couldn't concentrate. I would day dream constantly- anything to escape that situation. The people who did this to me were my classmates. I wanted nothing more than to not be there. In the evenings I'd pray to god for hours for it snow, so I wouldn't have to go to school. Under my bed covers, I held my breath, hoping I would run out of oxygen and die. \n\nI tried to find escapism everywhere. Movies, books etc. \n\nThe teacher was useless. Made me feel like shit. Thought I was a drama queen. Berated me until I cried about my sloppy work and bad concentration. Horribly sarcastic. He was also quite openly gay and had very effeminate mannerisms. I don't know if this had anything to do what was happening. My best friend is gay, I don't dislike gay people- I love my best friend- but I've grown to hate this man to a massive degree. I would rather hate him than hate myself.\n\nIn the end, he put me in this extra period for the 'dumb kids' so I missed breaktime. It would've been a relief but low and behold 3 of the bullies were put there too, including the molester. While I couldn't describe what was happening to me, I fucking named names previously. That cunt of a teacher knew exactly what he was doing. Needless to say, these periods were as horrible and uncomfortable for me as you can imagine.\n\nI've tried to forgive the boy who did it. The molester. I still remember his name. I imagine he was being abused at home. I imagine that the horrible stuff had to come from somewhere other than his imagination. \n\nI will never forgive the teacher. Nor the useless, thick as shit headmaster. At best, they failed in their most basic of duties. At worst, they were more than aware of what was going on, perhaps the teacher even enjoyed it. Regardless, my hate for him and the anger I have grows as I go deeper into adulthood- that I still have two eyes and ears now, that I can see what happens around me- he could have too. He chose not to. I wish that I could scar his life, like he scarred mine.\n\nEventually, my dad found a better job back in the area I originally grew up in and we moved back where we came from. Two years of hell for nothing. \n\nThe relief I felt moving back home was indescribable. But something had changed inside of me. Something had become twisted and it still is. I truly hate the world. Especially the UK. You would never guess that from talking to me. I try my best to make people happy- I want other people to feel good. I love some people so deeply. But the structure of our society is terrible. Evil really does exist and we do nothing to stop it. \n\nI'm doing better than I was. I'm engaged to a beautiful woman. And some fantastic job opportunities have come up. I lived abroad for 4 years and have returned to the UK stronger than ever before. But just seeing these drab, grey streets and it's even more useless and pathetic people has brought back these memories once again. \n\nI wish I could have justice, I really do. But these things happened 19 years ago. The only noticeable thing about me that you'd ever guess there was something wrong is that I'm a chainsmoker. Socially acceptable self harm. Helps.\n\nI feel like I could've been a better person, a kinder, more genuine person if this didn't happen to me. Sometimes, I don't even feel real, like I'm not 100% human, that something is missing. I so rarely feel true joy. But I'll smile for people because I want them to feel good.\n\nWell, ramble over.

When we had our big fight and I initiated NC, I told him to send me a check. He didn't. So my friend, being the doll that she is, sent him an email with a bill for the money he owed me and gave him an address to send a check to (not mine, thank God), and my Venmo account information.  \n\nMy therapist and I have been discussing that since he said he'd send me the check and then I'd \"never hear\" from him again, that he might be intentionally not paying this debt so that there'd still be some form of connection to me. An opportunity to hoover. Something that connected us, even if it was something negative, it was there.\n\nPart of me kind of liked that idea, as sad as it sounds. I liked the idea that he wanted to keep that door open a crack and I was the one with the power to stop it opening any further.

This is my first post ever here so excuse me if put this in the wrong section. I just want to share my story. \n\nBackground (if you don\u2019t care please skip to current):\nMy childhood is crappy but it\u2019s not as bad as other people. I grew up with the idea that adults are always right. So when my teacher literally beats me for my lunch money, when my uncle beats me because he hates my dad (I found out as an adult), and when a close family friend started doing things to me, I took it all like a champ and kept silent. I was a perfect little victim wasn\u2019t I? Really, I\u2019m surprise nothing worst happened. I was 5-6 years old at the time this all happen. When I was 7-8 years old, my brother was born, we moved away and things improved a lot. \n\nSometime in high school,\nit occurred to me that what happen to me was not right and at 16 years old I told my best friend and my mother what happened.\n\nCurrently: \nI am a 26 years old who never been in a relationship ever and Ive never been intimate with anyone. Not even a kiss. After I graduate with a bachelors degree and obtaining a relatively stable job, my friends had push me to break out of my shell and go out a bit. So I did. I went on one or two dates, but I\u2019m always super uncomfortable and it ends relatively quick. Adulthood was pretty normal other than that. I deal with self worthlessness, lack of self-confident, anxiety and depression like everyone else. I struggle with making friends and \nI have very few whom I love, cherish and appreciate very much.\n\nI cope with things through humor and by trying to make light of it. After a drink during one of our get together, they tease me, something about letting my \u201cwhoreself\u201d out and asked \u201cwhen the last time you got heads?\u201d I joked back \u201cyeah, when I was five (haha?)\u201d I honestly was expecting laughters. It didn\u2019t get it. \n\nThey apology for \u201cforcing me to go out.\u201d But she didn\u2019t. I want to be normal.  Another said I need to talk to a specialist. They all agree that they are al there for me but I need to talk to someone more professional. \n\nI know little to nothing about counseling or psychologist. What am I going to do, lay on a red fancy chair and vent? I don\u2019t even know if they take my or any insurance at all. Part of me does not believe counseling will help and it will be a waste of time for everyone. I am what i am. And I am always just a fly passing by. All that stuff happened in the past and it was only for a year or two. Surely that does not affect how I am that much right. I will try it out since they were genuinely concern and were quiet persistent about it. \n\nSide note: (should this be r/parenting)\nany  form of urogenital tract disorder in children, should warrant parents to keep a close eye on that child and who\u2019s with them. Yes, it could be because the child is unsanitary, new to potty training, and not cleaning herself properly but it can also be something terrible that you don\u2019t want to believe.

Otherwise, I have legal counsel and I can and will disregard anything that helps the both of us split up.

He can be kind of a slob.  Funny to me when he picks a fight if I do the same.  Funny.  Not funny.\n\nSo this week, he dumped out his over night bag when he returned from a weekend away (such a great weekend for me to breathe at home alone) in the middle of our shared walk-in closet.  I left it alone for a day.\n\nNext day?  Still there.  I tripped on it three times.  So I piled it up and got it out of my way.  Out of OUR way.  That was a few days ago.  Passive aggressive behavior on his part continued.  What ever.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------\n\nI took up double shifts to prepare to pay for my move out and I got home from work tonight and much joy to NOT see his truck in the garage!

I contemplated for an hour how to respond.  He's not home.  Talking to him tonight has historically proven to be a bad idea.  So I decided to respond by text.\n\nI wrote him, \"Not sure what you're referring to here.  But the note taped to my \"guest bedroom\" door is acknowledged and respected and appreciated.  Please continue to do the same.  Call me crazy, but if I moved your stuff strewn about the floor of our shared closet, that I tripped on three times, I didn't \"go through it\".

I kindly request that you \"just answer\" this question:  When are you going to help me help us sell this house and settle on the truck?\"\n\nHe got home an hour later.  I'm in my guest bedroom.

It's not as scary as a lot of things I have read on here, but it still pains me and negatively affects my every day life. I guess I'm just hoping for some feedback and to be told I'm not going crazy - because sometimes it feels that way.\n\nMy story started early September last year. I was in a 3 year relationship which I was having doubts about. Essentially, I had decided my bf (now ex) and I needed to break up (he's a good guy but the relationship just wasn't progressing and he was spending increasingly more and more time overseas) but I didn't want to hurt him and kept putting it off. Enter the suspected narc - we work together and struck up a friendship. He became aware of the fact that my ex was away a lot and that I was having major doubts about the relationship and started making comments to discredit my ex (who he'd never even met). At the same time he started to turn the charm on and on one occasion tried to kiss me. I stopped him and said I wasn't comfortable with it as I was still with my bf. I felt guilty for a week then finally gained the courage to break up with my bf. After that I allowed myself to become involved with narc guy.\n\nDuring the first month he put me on a crazy pedestal (lots of gifts and spending money on dates, had a portrait of us commissioned, would make me lunch and bring it to work every day, put a Berocca on my desk at work if he knew I'd had a late night, went on about how beautiful I was and how beautiful my soul was, told me he was falling in love with me and that I was marriage material, he volunteered at the same charity I do) and to be honest it just felt nice to have the attention.\n\nFrom the beginning there were things about him that didn't quite sit right with me and in my heart I knew he probably wasn't the one for me, but for some reason I didn't walk away. He started to do or say things which didn't seem normal to me and my brain started fighting with my gut to rationalise his behaviour. He bragged about himself a lot and would put almost every other person down, including some of my close friends. He continued to push my boundaries... if he offered me some food or a drink and I refused he would repeatedly try to convince me to have it... he'd ask me to choose a movie to watch then dismiss my suggestion and put something else on... when I left the room (usually just to go to the bathroom or check my phone) he would ask me what I was doing... once when I was in the bathroom he picked the lock and let himself in - I told him to get out... another time I was done brushing my teeth and I tried to leave the bathroom and he blocked my exit with his body and then ripped a painting off the wall and threw it in the bin saying \"I never liked that painting\" - I just sat on the side of the bathtub until he was done and I was allowed to leave... one night I made a joke he must not have liked while he was washing the dishes and went to bed without talking to me - in the morning he said I'd made him so mad that he had wanted to smash the dishes and leave... he accused me of casting a 'love spell' on him... one day at work he got annoyed that he had to help load items from a trolley into a van (he was the only guy available so he was asked to help lift some of the heavier items) - after he was done he picked up the trolley and threw it into the skip (large bin) in front of me and a group of colleagues... one night we were eating dinner and watching a movie on his couch when he looked at me and said, \"When did you get here?\"... often when I would express my feelings or ask him a question he would either respond, \"Okay\" or not respond at all... I told him that sometimes he looked at me as though he hated me - the humanity seemed to be missing from his eyes and it was as though he was looking right through me... one night I was out drinking with friends and my phone was dead - he kept calling my friends to find out where I was then showed up to collect me - I wanted to go home but he took me to his place instead and refused to let me sleep - he kept trying to kiss me and I kept pulling away from him - this went on for hours... that same night a police officer bruised his arm because he tried to run away when the cop asked to speak to him... he would steal from supermarkets if he thought something was too expensive...\n\nI then found out from coworkers that he had a gf on another continent and that she was saving up to move here and be with him. Ha. I confronted him and he tried to work a couple of different angles: \"She's struggling to get her visa so I don't think there's a future for us\", \"Our relationship is open while we're doing long distance\"... I told him that it wasn't fair and that he should confess to her before she packed up her whole life and moved across the world for him - he sent me a screenshot of his confession to her and took a couple of days off work to recover from the emotional turmoil. It was glaringly obvious to me that he'd manipulated the screenshot to get me off his case but I had trouble accepting that he would lie about something like that and that he'd take time off work to make his lie look more convincing.\n\nI kept trying to back off from him at this point but he was able to suck me back in repeatedly. This is where he started to devalue me. I would reject his advances repeatedly and then eventually give in - he told me, \"I love it when you give in\"... he started to tell me that I was boring when I talked about something I was interested in... he accused me of hiding items of clothing in his wardrobe to get him in trouble when his gf moved here... he told me he didn't want to hurt anyone and that it would be better if he was dead... the last time we were together I picked up some drawings we'd done together and he said, \"I need to throw those in the bin before my gf moves here\", I replied jokingly, \"I bet you wish you could just throw me in the bin\", he responded with, \"Throwing you in the bin would be too good for you, I should push you off a cliff\" - he didn't laugh or smile or indicate that it was a joke, he just stared at me. This was the point that I decided I had to get away from this guy.\n\nI packed up my things and told him that I was having lunch with a friend and that I had to go. He tried to make me eat breakfast before I left, then when I kept refusing insisted that I wait and watch him eat breakfast so he could walk me to my car. I kept refusing and said I had to go. When I got home I messaged the overseas gf and told her who I was - she was devastated. On Christmas morning he sent me 15 selfies of them kissing with the caption, \"This is what love looks like, you and I were a mistake\", then later, \"You have ruined Christmas for two families\". I didn't reply and blocked him on everything. We each had 2 weeks of holidays and in that time the only contact I had from him was him making new Instagram accounts to view my stories. Each time I'd block an account he'd make a new one, then started using his friends accounts.\n\nWhen we got back to work we ignored each other for a few days, then one morning he was waiting in the car park for me when I got to work (he knew my routine) and approached me wanting to talk - I told him we had nothing to talk about and started talking to a stranger in the car park to get away from him. A couple of weeks went by of him trying to get my attention at work and me avoiding him, then eventually I felt so anxious I decided to try talking to him to see if it would help. The conversation was mostly one sided - He apologised for what he had put me through and told me he still cared about me, but his gf had now moved over to be with him and they were living together. He said she had banned him from speaking to or seeing me, then told me, \"I like to imagine how things could have been between us had I not had a gf when I met you\".\n\nAfter this conversation I went back to mostly ignoring him (he'd been banned from speaking to me, after all) but this just prompted him to come up with more and more elaborate ways to get my attention - walking past my desk for no apparent reason... trying to engage me in conversation through a group of people... sending links to articles he thought I would like to my work email (I'd blocked him on everything else)... faking work reasons to email me (our roles have zero overlap so there's no reason for him to email me about work)... trying to get me in trouble with my manager... waiting for me to enter the kitchen at lunch time to publicly phone a restaurant to book a valentine's day dinner for him and his gf... pinning up a huge photo of him and his gf at his desk... discussing how fantastic his relationship is when I'm in earshot of him... and most recently emailing me at work to say he had to speak to me urgently, then going home early when I went to see him. This put me into a panic so I unblocked his number and asked him what was so urgent. He told me he was busy and that it could wait till tomorrow then wouldn't reply again. The next day I was an anxious wreck and demanded he tell me what was so urgent. He told me he had an STI and that I needed to get tested, and kind of implied that I had given it to him - my tests had already come back clean so I knew that wasn't true. A few days later he told me it had been a misdiagnosis... I think he just made the whole thing up to mess with me, which it did.\n\nAfter this we started to talk a bit as friends. He told me he missed my friendship and that his gf was going away for a week. He then implied several times that we should hang out and I reminded him that he was banned from seeing me. We continued to be fairly friendly for a couple of weeks - mostly he would just brag about himself in some way or another, then he stopped replying to me. I called him out on it and he still didn't reply. Three days ago I was in the work kitchen with a couple of coworkers (who know a but about my situation) when he came in and greeted me with an over the top, \"Good morning\". I stared him in the eyes and said, \"You are a joke. Do not speak to me\". He replied with his usual, \"Okay\" and left.\n\nObviously I need to continue no contact and to get a new job. I've started taking antidepressants just to help get me through each day. Reading over all this I realise how mad it all sounds and wonder why I even doubt my sanity. I guess that's just what happens though. I'm just so tired.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Please help me.", "author": "scienceguy1729", "self_text": "I (21M) was in a 10 month relationship with my ex (21F). We met in college. She had been in an emotionally abusive relationship for 2 years where she was forced to engage in sexual activities with her ex (same college). Since it was her first relationship she wasn't aware that he was abusive. She tried her best to fix it and stay with him. After a point, she couldn't take it anymore and dumped him. After a year, we got together. Although she didn't show signs of having been abused in the beginning, a few minor things began to trigger her. Things like us getting physical or being sexually active. I never forced her and always made sure she felt comfortable.\nI suffer from clinically diagnosed with anxiety and depression (about which I was not aware of at the time) and was riddled with insecurities in the beginning of the relationship. I was jealous of their relationship initially where I romanticized them and wished I was like him. I'd irrationally get pissed, jealous and judge her out of retroactive jealousy. She stuck with me through all that. \nShe always felt angry when I told her I idolized him (I knew him personally as a friend before we had gotten together and thought of him as a cool guy, although I did on the inside somewhere think he was not really a good person). \nBut as time went on, I began to see his true nature from her accounts of their relationship. I started taking medication for my anxiety and depression and things started getting better. But as things got better for me, things got worse for her. As she told me more about her relationship and got more and more triggered about us engaging in physically intimate activities, I began to see that she was showing signs of having been abused. I always had her back and made sure she didn't feel forced into anything. I read her expressions and didn't guilt trip her or make her feel ashamed. I took no for a no and was there for her. I researched as much as I could and I was the one to break the news to her. Initially she didn't believe me. She took her time to digest it. But it became apparent that her distaste towards physical intimacy was something she could not control. \nSince I am by nature a touchy person and love holding hands, kissing etc., I found it difficult to hold myself back. I socially conditioned myself to believe that my desires are sinful and tried to push them inside me. Our relationship began to seem like it was more platonic and romantic as time went on and I felt something was wrong. Finally, I reached my breaking point where my cognitive dissonance caused me to get depressed and angry. When I confided in her that I was unhappy we had no choice but to end the relationship for the better. We decided to stay close friends and help each other no matter what.\nMy appointments with my psychiatrist began to include mentions of her and her story as well. He told me that she is showing signs of a rape victim and that sexual coercion is synonymous with rape. When I told her this, she broke down and confided it one of her friends (who is studying medicine), who agreed that sex under duress is a form of rape. My ex at this point has accepted her situation and she actively does not like any form of romantic display of affection from me (I tried getting back together with her as we both still clearly love each other). \nI have severe anger management issues and I hate the guy who did this to her. I don't know how to move past this. I had thought of my ex as my wife more than my girlfriend in the relationship and it feels as though she was raped when we were together as all of her issues came out in the middle of the relationship. I had planned to marry her and have a future with her. Now, it feels as though the guy who did this to her has stolen everything from me. I feel powerless. I feel like I couldn't protect her. I feel like I should have asked her out before he did, in the beginning of college.\nI see him from time to time and it triggers me. Throughout our relationship I have imagined killing him in multiple ways. I can not confront him, nor can I initiate a physical fight with him because it will drag him back into her life. Moreover the nature of their relationship is a secret and she doesn't want it to come out. I am forced to relieve my stress and anger through gym and physically fighting with my friends (we do that for fun like in the movie fight club). But the relief is temporary and I have resorted to smoking to feel better. I don't know what to do. Can someone please help me?\n\nTL;DR\nThe woman I love was abused and she is showing signs of having been raped by her previous partner. We broke up but we still love each other. I feel like my whole future with her has been destroyed by him. I have severe anger management issues and do not know what to do. Please help me.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I hadn\u2019t had any issues visiting her since our breakup 8 months ago. I got in my car and he kicked and punched my car repeatedly causing 1500 dollars in damage. \n\nI finally had something I could go to the police with so I contacted our PD and they filed felony vandalism charges (March 19, 2019). I received a restraining order two weeks ago. \n\nCourt is coming up in a couple weeks. He was actually arrested when they served him and released because no warrant had been issued.

And if so, why is this happening? I just ended my one-month long relationship with someone I suspect to be a narcissist. It wasn't until last week that I realised everyone I've ever dated is like this. I genuinely feel as if I am hooked on the highs and lows of these types of relationships and fear that a healthy relationship won't even appeal to me. I enjoy the high right after the low so much that it's scary. A big part of the reason I have ended this relationship so quickly is because when he got really crazy my friend overheard and was like \"I thought I liked bad guys, but I can't believe you let your boyfriend talk to you like that\". That was a bit of a wake-up call for me. It just sucks so much because part of me still really wants to rationalize things and have hope that maybe he isn't really a narcissist and things aren't that bad and I should go back to him. I start to think of all the narcissist characteristics and if he checks 8 out of 9 I think, \"Well he doesn't do that one thing, maybe he's not. Maybe it's okay.\" Sorry, I'm rambling now. I am aware that he doesn't even have to necessarily meet all the requirements of being a narcissist in order for me to dump him. It just sucks not having anyone to talk to about the crazy cycle of rationalizing because most people haven't been in this situation. This is just the first night of the break-up and he went from wanting his stuff back in hopes he'd see me to telling me \"Do whatever honestly just throw it away. I really don't care at this point\" after I said I would leave it at his house while he wasn't there. Thanks for reading!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It made me remember a time when my ex Narc had reduced me to an empty shell of myself. The cheating, the physical abuse, the emotional and financial abuse. I even began to abuse myself and stop eating and started self harming. I remember pleading to him to please just stop this and asking him why he was doing it to me. The cheating had completely ripped any self-esteem I had apart. I felt ugly and worthless. \n\nI tried to reach out to his heart and his soul. I tried to reach out to a fellow human being and ask him with all my heart and hope, to please free me from that pain. I tried my best to let him know that his torment was killing me, literally - my physical health had deteriorated. I told him that I was so low that I thought more about suicide than I did anything else. I was a mess. I was like a small child, a vulnerable child reaching out for the smallest amount of sympathy and understanding. He saw my pain, he saw it clearly. He knew he was destroying me. He looked at me with disgust. Pure and utter disgust. And he said to me with spit flying out of his mouth, his teeth clenched and dark dark eyes; \n\n*\u201dwhy should I have to have your broken heart on my conscience, why should I have to put up with that. No, I don\u2019t have to deal with that.\u201d*\n\nThis says to me that his own conscience told him that what he was doing was wrong. That he understood exactly what he was doing. But that he actually thought of himself as more important than his own conscience was trying to let on. That he actually felt somewhere in there, that he was entitled to pick and choose between what he will take responsibility for. And what he will accept to leave a mark on his conscience. He had caused me all that pain, he had chose to do that. And then when it all set in as planned and I whittled down to nothing, but a ball of what felt like eternal pain - he then stepped back, decided his work was done and that he didn\u2019t have to care for what he did. He didn\u2019t have to put up with my emotions, because although he had purposely caused them - they were mine and therefore, weren\u2019t his responsibility. \n\nIt\u2019s like they purposely do things to cause you pain. You react with pain. And then they get disgusted in you for even being able to react with such pain. Despite the fact being that was their very intention. It\u2019s like they want you to absorb all of their hatred and anger and every negative emotion and insecurity they possess - and just not respond to any of it. They feel entitled to throw all of this at you. But they don\u2019t feel you have a right to react to any of it. They see us as dumping grounds. It almost feels sometimes as though they expect us to be grateful for the pain they cause us.\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I\u2019d been having sex with someone whilst he was at work and then letting them go home in his clothes - I could never understand this accusation because why would my supposed secret lover want to wear my boyfriends clothes? Although I couldn\u2019t really confront him because he never directly made that accusation. But I always knew what he was implying. If I was to have directly stated what I believed he was accusing me of, he would have took this as an admission of guilt and confession and would have claimed he never said that. \n\n\u2022 He had a cocaine and weed habit. Yet he would accuse me of being a drug addict. I took lots of pain killers whilst together, but in hindsight that\u2019s because I was always in pain. From the stress and the physical abuse. Not because I was a pill-head. Yet he would do things like hide my Himalayan bath salt crystals because he believed them to actually be crystals of a drug that I was hiding in plain sight! \n\n\u2022 We would speak on the phone and he would say \u201cdid you hear that\u201d and I wouldn\u2019t hear anything - unless it was something like the signal making the call crackly. And he would go on to tell me how \u2018they\u2019 were bugging his phone and \u2018they\u2019ve\u2019 probably bugged mine too. I still to this day have no idea who \u2018they\u2019 are though.  \n\n\u2022 A few times we were apart and he called at night whilst on cocaine. We would just be having a normal chat and he would stop and ask why I was breathing heavy. I wasn\u2019t breathing heavy at all. He was yet again implying I was cheating. Like I would be having sex whilst on the phone to him... but he never directly said it and I didn\u2019t dare to ask him if that\u2019s what he was implying. But I knew it was. So I eventually would be scared to breathe whilst on the phone. I would try to hold the phone a bit away from me or not breathe whilst he spoke. \n\n\u2022 He would always accuse me of having him on loudspeaker, even though he wasn\u2019t. \n\n\u2022 I drink non-dairy milk. So once I went to work with a juice bottle I re-used to put some of my alternative milk in. I liked to have a tea at work and they only had cows milk. I came home from work and left the bottle on the side. It still had some milk in. He came back from work and was in a weird mood. Tons of silent treatment and passive aggressiveness later, and he \u2018confronted\u2019 me about the apparent cum in the juice bottle that I must have got my secret lover to jizz into whilst he was at work and then left it there just to piss him off. I mean seriously...how did his brain even come up with that one?! I actually couldn\u2019t help but laugh when he confronted me with it. Of course, that made it worse. \n\n\u2022 I was in the bath and it was only me and him in the house (I was a uni student when we lived together and we shared the flat with my friends). He was watching football downstairs. It was a quiet evening. I heard this whooshing sound and tapping noises and just weird noises coming from outside the bathroom. I called out to him and he didn\u2019t answer. I heard it again. I went and asked him if it was him after my bath. He said no, definitely wasn\u2019t me. But it had to have been. He didn\u2019t even ask me about what noise it was or check the place to see if anyone was there. He said just said no it wasn\u2019t him and carried on watching football. We had our flat broken into a few months before that, you would have thought he would have double checked the place and asked if I was ok. \n\n\u2022 When our flat was broken into, we came home together from visiting our families separately over Christmas. I had left to see family over Christmas several days before he left the flat. When we came back the back door window was smashed and there was a knife on my bed. Nothing was taken. Not my stuff or anything from my three friends bedrooms. Not the 2 playstations, the flat screen tv...nothing. Just a knife left ...on my bed (or mine and narcs should I say - but he was staying there unbeknownst to the landlord).  We sat down and spoke about who it could have been. I told him to check upstairs and see if anyone was still up there...he wouldn\u2019t. So I did. By myself. At the time 20 years old, him 24. He let me go up there alone. And I did out of pure frustration of him not doing it. I came back down saw no one, and said we should call the police. He looked at me, tilted his head and said \u201cfor someone with anxiety you don\u2019t seem all that scared\u201d he then paused, looked me deep in the eyes and said \u201cwas it you\u201d - why on earth would I break into my own flat and leave a knife on the bed?! I honestly believe it was him and done to induce fear in me and when it didn\u2019t work he was surprised and annoyed by it. A little background info; I had a gun shot through my door at 15. So maybe that\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t as scared. Or maybe my gut knew it was him. \n\n\u2022 If I was to ever get up in the night to go to the toilet he\u2019d accuse me of cheating. He\u2019d imply I\u2019d gone upstairs to have sex with one of my flatmates. Or he would accuse me of getting out of the bed in the night and disappearing for ages when I didn\u2019t! \n\n\u2022 Me and him were chilling with one of the guys who we lived with. He was playing music on my laptop. His mood suddenly changed and I got anxious. He asked to speak to me in the kitchen away from the flatmate. He then told me to tell the truth and he wouldn\u2019t be mad, about why I had the flat guy\u2019s computer next to shared computers under the WiFi. He tried to accuse me of sharing explicit pictures or secret info of some kind with my flatmate. I explained to him several times that it comes under shared computers because anyone\u2019s laptop in the house will show up on each other\u2019s because we share the same WiFi. Although, we can\u2019t access each other\u2019s documents without each other\u2019s passwords. He still didn\u2019t believe me. \n\n\u2022 We use to travel back to see family together on a coach. We were travelling to the coach station. Holding hands, cuddling etc - he was really attentive. We got to the coach station and he just started acting off. He ignored me the whole 3 hour coach journey home. He wouldn\u2019t tell me what was wrong just said \u201cyou know what you did\u201d. I cried the whole way home and he just sat next to me, eating and listening to music. I had to do a lot of grovelling for the next few days and he ruined my time seeing my family (probably his intentions). I still till this day don\u2019t know what I did wrong. I have a few instances like that where all I ever got was \u201cyou know what you did\u201d. \n\n...these are only scratching the surface. But it does baffle me that I was in that much denial I overlooked all of these things and thought I was the crazy one. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I'd say it's been true for me up until last year. I could touch anything and not get addicted. I was all about balance, being honest with myself about where I was at and moderating intake of whatever I was consuming. (Not that I've tried anything too crazy but you get the picture.)\n\nBut... I feel like being with my Nex rewired my brain. I have to really watch myself now so I don't get addicted to things. I feel like I don't trust myself to not spiral out of control. Maybe this was because I drank *way* too much after the discard, and although I've cut back significantly I've had to go to an addiction specialist to address it. (She's asserted I am not addicted to alcohol, but I am dependent.)\n\nDrinking makes me feel guilty every damn day but I feel like I just need that moment of temporary detachment to make it through the day. I'll only have 2-3 drinks, but I'm having them nearly every day. I'm a smaller person so it's enough to help me feel distracted and happy.\n\nIf I watch more than a few episodes of a TV show, I feel guilty. If I have two donuts, I get worried. If I play a video game for more than an hour or two, I have to stop myself. I keep wanting to go find some attractive stranger as a make out buddy, which is easy to do since I'm at uni, but I'm pretty sure the last thing I need right now is anything resembling a romantic connection. I would just hurt whoever I'm with. If I even catch myself flirting with someone, I feel guilty partially because I know I have nothing to offer them right now, and partially because it feels like I'm cheating on my Nex, despite the fact that it's been 9 months since he cheated on me and 8 months NC. And then of course I'm still drinking too much. (Although to be fair, that has gotten better in general over the past few months.)\n\nIt's just hard feeling like I don't trust myself enough to limit my consumption of anything. I could always trust myself in the past. Now I feel like I'm split in two; one part of me is this ever-watchful, hyper-attentive, nervewracked mother and the other is this little child that has this gaping hungry chasm inside and needs to fill it with anything and everything and doesn't care about limitations or boundaries. It just wants to consume, consume, consume.\n\nIt just frightens me. Feeling out of control (or like I could easily fall out of control) is a relatively new experience in my life.

Or I really was the worst person to ever be in his life, I don\u2019t know. They also apparently were able to message him when he told me he blocked them. Hm. Is that common?\n\nBut I digress. There was one ex. He lied to me about her of course (told me he blocked all of them). \n\nBut she was there the ENTIRE time. We were long distance but I could see her liking his posts all the time. He would do the same. I backdated (not proud, desperate times) and saw this was ongoing. \n\nThen when we did meet up I noticed things. He snap chatted her. She messaged him. He sent her messages. It was just ongoing. \n\nShe by the way was married and had a baby during this time period. So \ud83d\ude43 great. \n\nI guess I\u2019m questioning things because a trait narcs seem to possess is the idealise devalue discard cycle and I can see that there was some level of contact throughout. Of course there were refollows (which I never got to the bottom of) but it was clear that she remained in his life at some level. Like he always had her social media and number and never blocked her on anything like he did with me and another ex. \n\nHe also seemed to increase contact every discard. How convenient...... \n\nAdditionally, they had mutual friends etc and I did not with him. \n\nI know that I don\u2019t know the full details but I know ENOUGH that they maintained some constant level of contact after their relationship that picked up when he discarded me. To me, that\u2019s a pretty clear signal that she didn\u2019t get the level of toxicity and subsequent blocking everywhere (by him) that I did. She literally was constantly liking his stuff. I hated it. And he liking hers. \n\nSo I got blocked everywhere early on and silent treatment during discard and absolutely cut out whereas she always got to have contact with him. \n\nMaybe because I was so easy to cut off. I HATE that I was long distance and none of his other exes were. It makes me feel like he just used me to kill time and didn\u2019t really want anything serious because he cut me off so easy. Like I was the transition. \n\nIs it possible she\u2019s just an ex he didn\u2019t abuse and go through this cycle with, that he doesn\u2019t do it with everyone and it\u2019s just me and one more ex that got relegated to the crazy pile? Or am I perhaps wrong in thinking he\u2019s a narc?\n\nOr maybe I brought it out in him, so I got that punishment?\n\nBasically I\u2019m wondering, if anyone else had a narc that had an ex that didn\u2019t really fit the pattern.

Slight put downs here, flinching away when I touched him there, hot and cold all of the time.

I let him know that she wanted a group of us to hangout after we were done. 20 minutes into dinner, and I hadn\u2019t actually let him know where we were eating, he texted me saying things like \u201cokay whatever, goodbye\u201d I felt so shitty seeing that.

It felt like I was reading pages of my own life. It\u2019s all starting to make sense now.\n\nThe final straw? We\u2019re in a long distance relationship, easily drivable distance, but too far apart to actually live together (which should have changed but that\u2019s another story for another day). Our day to day communication relies on phone calls and text. \n\nLast night, he disappeared from our conversation. I assumed he\u2019d fallen asleep and, this morning, I asked if he did. He said he did. \n\nI\u2019ve long suspected he\u2019s not telling the truth about most things he tells me...you all know the paranoia full well, I\u2019m sure.\n\nAnd so I went snooping.\n\nSure enough, he spent last night live streaming a drunken chat with his friends where he graphically detailed stories of girls he used to \u201cfuck\u201d.\n\nHe\u2019s whittled my self esteem down to nothing so he KNOWS I\u2019m especially sensitive to this type of behavior from him.\n\nI didn\u2019t tell him I knew, just nonchalantly asked, \u201cso you feel asleep last night?\u201d and he said yes. \u201cPromise?\u201d I asked....no response.\n\nThe real kicker? I know he\u2019ll just fully place the blame on me for \u201csnooping\u201d. The even bigger kicker? He recently told me that spending an hour on the phone with me talking about our day was just too much. \n\nApparently 4 solid hours of conversation is not too much though...so long as the topic is all of his past sexual conquests.\n\nYou ever feel so angry and hurt that you just go numb?

My ex of 3 years who was in the military had dumped me over text and my life seemed to have fallen apart. I lost a job, was couchsurfing for a few months. I finally got back on my feet, had two solid jobs, and a nice place to live. I decided to try dating again and that's when I met him\n\n  I shouldve noticed the red flags immediately. We had matched on tinder. He complimented me and we talked a little bit and then he gave me his number. He blew up my instagram with likes and comments and also was texting me a lot. He was very open with me and it felt like I had known him for a long time. \n\n  We met, and he was very attractive. Took very good care of himself, was dressed really nicely. We hung out and just got to know eachother, we seemed to have a ton in common which he pointed out. He told me he never met anyone like me or felt so at peace around anyone. He shared secrets with me and told me how much he liked me. He gave me a ride to work and held my hand the whole time, and while I was there texted me about how he couldn't wait to see me again. He also made all these promises like he'd help me drive and he was going to take me to a concert and all this stuff...ridiculous, I know, but I was also new to the city and didn't know a lot of people. He made me feel so special, like i was the best thing that ever existed. I don't know how to explain it. The next night, he came back over and met my roommates/friends. We went to my room where he said he felt a weird vibe from them. And he stayed over, telling me how attractive I was and the perfect girl for him and all that...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Then, he starts ghosting me. He texts me and blows up my phone, and we make all these plans and then he just doesn't show up. He the ntells me how he has a lot going on and etc. Which is fine. But he keeps doing it making me stay up and waiting for him just to never show up. I finally got fed up and confronted him about it where he gaslit me and told me that it was \"weird that I would think he would like me since he never said that\" and all this stuff attacking me (he told me multiple times that he liked me). At this point I felt obsessed, it was weird because I had never felt like this before and felt addicted to him. \n\n  After our fight, he apologized and said he did like me. And this went on for months...this pattern of him saying he liked me and wanted to see me, him not showing up, us fighting...finally we got into a HUGE fight and blocked eachother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  A month later, he and my friend's boyfriend at the time reaches out to him because he's a popular skater and artist and he tells him how he messed things up with me and regretted it. He comes over, apologizes and tells me how he messed up because I was the girl for him the whole time. Because I was still obsessive over him, I forgave him and we started going slow. He started staying over all the time, would tell me he loved me. He also started doing Xanax really heavily and opened up to me about trauma he had. We both drank one night and opened up to eachother and he told me how he loved me and wanted to keep me safe.\n\n  Then, things started to change. One minute we'd be having fun and laughing, then suddenly he'd be yelling at me telling me how i was trying to be like him and how I was trying too hard to be \"cool\": and how I needed to be my \"own f\\*\\*\\*ing person\". He'd say how the things I liked was stupid.\n\n  It threw me so off guard it felt like a sudden punch to the face. He would just say these terrible things or try to manipulate me and I couldn't believe it happened because right after he'd be acting like things were fine.\n\n  There was a time where we were in my room and my friend was talking to me and he was being so disrespectful and sighing annoyed and then when she left he told me my friends weren't cool and I shouldn't want to be seen with them. I told him off about it and then he acted all nice. He'd tell me I was the worst sex he ever had if i didn't do what he wanted.\n\n  I grew up in a very abusive household and lost my brother. When we first started talking again, he was very sympathetic. Later, he told me his life was worse and how I just wanted sympathy. He also spread rumors about me all the time and told me if he killed himself it would be my fault.\n\n  He also would openly talk to other girls and show me their pictures. If I got upset he'd threaten that maybe we shouldn't talk since I\"m taking things too seriously yet one time I talked about a guy I had seen at the store and he flipped out and ran to his car for 40 minutes until I went outside to comfort him and he told me how it had hurt his feelings since we were dating. The next day he told me he didn't know why he said that because he'd never date me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  Eventually the constant making fun of me took a toll. I stopped liking the things I used to like and felt constantly ashamed of myself. It reminded me of my childhood because my stepfather was a narc too. I became agoraphobic and stopped leaving the house. I eventually had to go to the psych ward because I was suicidal and felt paranoid because he convinced me that all my friends I had made in my new city actually didn't like me and felt sorry for me and talked shit on me to him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  I was friends with his best friend, and his best friend said he would do the same things to him and apologized to me for how he treated me. He told me that he was like a \"walking trigger\" and he had to go no contact with him for awhile. he'd flip out of me if i took pictures of us together or if I took pictures of me while wearing anything of his. He'd make fun of me for my music, my sense of humor, anytime I was having a good time he'd attack and ridicule me while simultaneously taking parts of my identity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n Another thing he would do is he'd be all over me and basically living with me for a month, and then he'd basically run away for a month and barely talk to me. He'd sayd he was leaving for the weekend to meet his skater friends but he'd be gone for weeks. And two of those times he claimed he had fallen in love with someone and they broke his heart. I got fed up and cut him off and his best friend said he went over there and threw a huge fit and was screaming that I dumped him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  This man has used me for money, resources, he took so much from me. The last time I saw him was last year. He ghosted me for 6 months, we \"dated\" for maybe 3...talked off and on for maybe 5. Each time I'd cut him off he'd find a way to pop up in my life.\n\n  The last time I saw him was a year ago. I was at a big party my friends had and he was there. He acted like he didn't know me that well. We have the same friends so his friends yelled at him and i gave him a hug and he yelled at me so I backed off. Later he saw me alone and was acting all nice hugging me saying how he missed me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  I moved to California in the summer of 2018. He had one of his friends send a picture of himself to me and began harrassing me and my new boyfriend. \n\n  Even though I'm in a new relationship and fulfilled my childhood dream of living in LA, I feel like a dead person. I don't remember anything about myself. I drink a lot, I let myself gain so much weight and I feel so empty. I feel no interest in anything and just feel like a shell of a person. I always feel like I'm dissociated. I feel constant shame and like i'm being judged all the time. It's horrible. I still obsess over him or getting revenge. It's negatively affecting my current relationship too. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

My mother did not ever raise her hand against us. Most of the brute force was from my father.\n\nAs kids we got in trouble for... well, kid things. I once hit my older brother, when I was ill with a fever, for calling me names. He tattled, and my father spanked me. My older brother and I got average grades\u2014neither failing nor too low\u2014and he hit us with the handle of a toy golf club\u2014which by the way, was metal. During a mass, we needed to use the restroom so my mother and one of my brothers left for the restroom. He got angry with my brothers and I for leaving because other people occupied our seats while we left. We were hit when we got home. He used to feed my younger brother and I to make sure we ate, and one time it was a particular vegetable that my brother couldn't stomach that he ended up spitting it into the ground. I watched while my father scoop the spat food back into the spoon and shoved it in his mouth. I was scolded for not singing during mass or first communion practice\u2014it was true that I did not sing during mass, I don't know why, but during practice I did\u2014I liked to sing.

I constantly feel like I'm tipping my toes whenever he's around. He does not take it well that I have depression. He doesn't understand. He has told me that I have no right to be depressed. He has misunderstood my anxiety attack as me just crying because I did not get what I want.\n\nI don't know if I was abused or if this is all just discipline. My second voice says it isn't. It's all just discipline. It does not think I was abused. I am told that I went through that because I was a bad child. I don't know anymore. \n\nEDIT: I also forgot to mention that all of this stopped when he worked overseas when I was age 10. He worked in Canada for years before he petitioned for us. I was 17 when we were reunited. He seems to have changed over the years he spent here. Like I said, back then he beat us with a toy golf club for getting average grades, but when I got into high school his mindset became \"as long as you passed it's fine\". He's more lenient, but he still has explosive anger. I suspect the only reason he can't raise his hand against us is because of the laws.

After work I message her to see if she still wants me to come over before the gym for the overtly expressed reason of having sex. She does.\n\nI get to her house and she's in a mood. Depressed. I feel bad for her because she's going through a rough patch in her life so i try to empathize. But I still am under the assumption she wants to have sex. I, after several minutes, manage to get her in the bedroom, pulling her away from a TV show she is currently watching.\n\nNow a half hour has gone by and I have already eaten my pre-workout meal, heavy on carbs, so I get a great workout in since I missed the day before attending to her. After beating around the bush for a while, trying to initiate things without expressly asking her to have sex, since that often seems a turnoff, but to no avail.\n\nI let her know that if she isn't into it, that's fine but I gotta go to the gym. She then proceeds to ask me to go to the store with or for her (it never got that far in the convo) to get her dog, food, since she wasn't feeling that great. I let her know that I wasn't going to do that because I was on a schedule and needed to attend to my needs especially since I had put it off the day before. But I told her I would be happy to go after the gym to get her dog food. Mind you, she had been home all day and I had been at work. Mind you, I had spent the entire evening with her the night before and didn't go to the gym becuase she wanted me to stay and keep her company.\n\nAnyway she got upset because I wouldn't go now to get her food. So, unfortunately, I got upset that she could even get upset abouut that. So I left for the gym. Anyway she goes on to accuse me over text that it is disconcerting to her that I get upset when she doesn't want to have sex since it is her body. I told her thats not why I got upset. Rather, I was upset that she doesn't respect my needs or understand the impetus for my frustration. It doesn't matter to her at that point. Her mind is made up. \n\nSo anyway, Im left reflecting on the circumstances. She asks me to come over. 20 minutes later I'm there. She doesn't want to have sex anymore but has tasks for me to complete. I decline. She gets upset. She misrepresents my frustration to justify hers.\n\nThis is such a small thing but is so reflective of the narcissistic relationship.\n\nFirst, she uses the bait and switch to get me to do things for her, on her time. Partially, to meet her needs. Partially, as a way to prove my devotion...maybe. Mostly, as a way to control. \n\nThen she refuses to acknowledge the fallacy of her belief: that I'm upset cuz she doesn't want to have sex. Cannot understand why I would be frustrated about her demanding things of me. But most importantly, she identifies me as the bad guy, as if by not meeting her needs in the moment I am a bad guy. \n\nYada Yada Yada. Anyway, it is really an insignificant event. Believe me, I know. But bending to the will of someone to your detriment is bad enough. Worse, is not doing so and being chastised for it.\n\nIt's good to stand up for yourself in relationships. Especially with people who constantly take. But being someone as I am, who is rather codependent, I end up in a constant game of push and pull. I try to meet her needs, to my detriment. When even this is not enough, I grow resentful. Drained and resentful, I act out. This opens me up for blame. Diverting attention from what caused me to act out in the first place. I break away. She fears abandonment and this triggers her. She comes crawling back with promises that she's changed. That she will be more emotionally available, responsible for her emotions etc. But of course each time I break away, she uses this as a reason not to do the very things she promises to do. She says she can't trust me because I'm always running away. And the vicious circle continues as the entropy picks up speed and we fall deeper into discontent.\n\nDo yourself a favor and do as I say, not as I do. Do not keep holding on. People do not change, not unless they want to and over very long periods of time.\n\nI'm open to any thoughts. Please be aware that this is a synopsis. Much is omitted for brevity.

I have never spanked or beaten anyone, and I don\u2019t tend forwards anger: I, instead, get panic attacks.

I\u2019m scared so much that if I leave, it will scar the little girl forever...I\u2019ve been so good to her through crucial years when her dad really treated her like dirt and barely talked to her, we\u2019ve just bonded. Ugh...that\u2019s one of the hardest parts.\n\nThen comes another challenge: when my father died, I really really tanked, and was prescribed medication from a doctor.

I\u2019m almost completely off, but these last few cuts are really crucial and I need to be a calm safe place so I can get off of this crap and move on with my life. Until I get off I have to be near my doctor as tapering off of this med is serious stuff!\n\nI\u2019m about 3-4 months from being entirely prescription pill free! Being stuck on this medication while delicately tapering off due to enormous physical discomfort, I believe is something my girlfriend has used to her advantage. I was what you might call the dominant person in the relationship, until I got really sick after my dad passed. I was sick for a few months and in that time she just grabbed the wheel.\n\nBut she has come to resent me for it all. I work remotely and have now for 5 years. I work my tail off weekly, I\u2019m so supportive of my girlfriend and her child, it\u2019s exhausting how much I\u2019ve laid down for them.\n\nMost times they bring me joy, but the dark moments of physical and verbal abuse have happened so many times over the past 5 years that it\u2019s definitely a big ass problem.\n\nI can\u2019t defend myself. First of all, I\u2019m still a bit fragile from all the traumas (won\u2019t go into it) I\u2019ve faced in life that I\u2019ve worked very hard to grow beyond  by quite a bit. Secondly, i dare not defend myself! If I did, either the girlfriend or her daughter will get so loud or physically violent, that I become terrified that a neighbor is going to hear them, call the police, haul me off to jail, where they won\u2019t take my tapering seriously, and it could be really really bad on my, thus far; very successful recovery from deeeeeeep grief.\n\nOther problem: we share our work and our clients together. She currently handles all the money, has my car in her name (long story), now only has herself covered with auto insurance so I\u2019m not able to drive, and treats me as though I\u2019m using her for her money! I make more money than her, but since she handles it all, she can really manipulate me into feeling like a nobody.\n\nWhen she loves me, she is the best! I know it\u2019s hard to be in her shoes with a child and a worthless ex, but I have been around so many people in my life and relationships: this is the most serious abuse I\u2019ve ever been through: it has left me terrified to talk to anyone but her. I am afraid to call my family or friends, partially because I\u2019m really frightened to talk seriosuly about my being abused...it\u2019s so humiliating, and if my close friends caught wind of how bad it is, they would really badger me to leave this woman. Leaving is probably the right move, but being badgered really isn\u2019t good for me either. I feel ultimately that I\u2019ve gotta make this move alone and in private for a bit of time. I really don\u2019t want her to know where I am after I leave for a bit. \n\nDang this sucks...obviously I love the woman. Most difficult but most long lasting relationship yet. Being a victim of abuse when you\u2019re a man with a woman you\u2019re in love with is...ugh...there\u2019s just almost no reasources for us to have a voice.\n\nI just want to be happy and confident again! I\u2019ve never dropped so low in my life. Heavens!\n\nWhich is exactly what I believe I need to do (I\u2019ve tried for 5 years), but I\u2019m broke without her for now (she controls all $$$) and we share clients...\n\nMy plan for now is to try and obtain a decent paying job in a nearby, but 2 hour drive away city, in a clandestine manner and just be as agreeable as possible until I can get out.\n\nI\u2019ll also have to save up a little bit of money.\n\nMany times a part of me just wants to escape (we aren\u2019t on a lease together, we don\u2019t have children together, and I could sell a few things enough to at least get myself out of here).\n\nThe little girl likes her grade school here and I don\u2019t want that to change, so I\u2019m going to be the one who has to go.\n\nIve just never been in this situation; being abused, estranged from my friends and family, while tapering off of sensitive medications, in a relationship that if I leave will break my heart, destroy my current client base, and possibly hurt the little girl. Lastly, many times I\u2019ve been afraid to leave her for what she might do to me if I did!\n\nYikes!\n\nThis is a first for me, in these 5 years, to finally reach out to Reddit. I\u2019ve seen so many quality responses to other peoples\u2019 posts like this so, thought maybe some of you might have some advice.\n\nI\u2019m near Los Angeles, and am looking for work down there. If I could land something really solid $50-80k/yr, I could easily move. At this point, I\u2019ve even considered a homeless shelter (since there\u2019s almost no battered mens\u2019 homes),\n\nI have a few friends in the area (originally from the Midwest), but I\u2019m really really shy and scared to tell them: 1. I\u2019m being abused 2. I need a place to stay.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be posting on Reddit if I felt like I had another person or place to talk to about this. I once had a thriving social life, and savings, and great credit and health. 5 years into this relationship, I\u2019m barely recognizable to who I once was. I\u2019ve seen and endured a lot of darkness in the past 5 years, and am very proud of myself for not losing my mind! Was NOT easy!\n\nSo am I overreacting?! What the heck do I do!! I\u2019m a 35 yr old guy, people don\u2019t take this kind of abuse seriously. They prey on my sensitive nervous system (panic disorder). I worry sometimes that their treatment of me will literally break my heart. Like, heart attack, just because as a man in today\u2019s world, when it comes to a girlfriend and a child, you\u2019re absolutely defenseless if you want to stay out of jail.\n\nYou just have to take the beatings until you can find a new route, but through this relationship I\u2019ve lost a lot\nOf my ability to trust anyone. I think she\u2019s really really screwed me up and brainwashed me and I won\u2019t even see the full scope of it until after I get out.\n\nSorry for the rant. Comments would be most welcome. Sorry if I sound frantic. I\u2019m nervous to write about this, as I\u2019ve told almost no one for 5 years. Help!", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Like do I have the right to be upset about my childhood :/", "author": "bailey_09", "self_text": "I always have such a hard time saying \"abuse\" because even though my dad was an asshole all of growing up, he still paid the mortgage, bought me a car, and helps me with college now. \n\nBut I have a lot of bad memories with him and can't really think of a time when we ever got along. Biggest, most terrible thing that still gets  me really heated to this day is my family's whole situation during the recession. He lost his job. I was just a kid at the time. And, I think my sister was probably too young to remember what actually happened so I can't talk to her about it much.  \n\nMy dad had a job for the first like 1/4 of the recession. Since 2008, what I've gathered from family members since is that he was fired because he literally stopped going into work. He thought he invaluable to the company, and simply put in the absolute bare-minimum. \n\nSo on top of an already shitty marriage, on top of this, my mom finally filed for divorce. I can't stress enough how close my parents were to getting divorced, like paperwork was filed with a lawyer, my mother was paying a lawyer, and my dad moved out of the house. I still remember the day he moved out, even though again my sister wouldn't. Shitty memory. \n\nEventually, my parents worked it out. Mostly, it was because my young sister and I begged my mom not to follow through with the divorce. \n\nWhat my mom didn't know is that my dad had really manipulated us. Whenever he had time alone with my sister and I, he went on and on about how terrible our lives were going to be when they got divorced. He told us about how our family was being ripped apart, and how unhappy all of us were going to be when our mother went through with the divorce. Like, I'm talking entire just days with this same conversation about our horrible futures. \n\nAnd so yeah, after her kids begged her for months, my mother decided to stay with him. He moved back in, and after after being unemployed for a long, long time, he finally got his shit together and provided. My mom, by the way, worked multiple nursing jobs and a professor job throughout the whole recession to singlehandedly pay our mortgage and give us a Christmas. \n\nAnyway, there's been a whole slew of other stuff. He gaslights the family all the time. I've moved out and far away from my hometown, but I worry a lot about my mom and my sister living with him. I kind of think it would've been better if my mom had really followed through with that divorce. \n\nThis turned more into a rant about him, sorry. I just have such a hard time calling him emotionally abusive because at the end of the day, once we got out of the recession, he gave me a lot. But looking back and talking with my adult friends, it's pretty clear to me that my relationship with my dad is not like theirs. In fact, it's pretty screwed up. \n\nIdk. Again sorry for the rant.

I'm changing details of this story to protect the identity of those involved. I found this subreddit tonight and I've been having a difficult time dealing with ruminating thoughts as of late so I wanted to share this story as a sort of cathartic practice. So here's some backstory before I get into it\n\nI went to high school with my abuser for 2 years. We were acquaintances in that time and didn't know each other very well although I had always secretly admired her.\n\nShe was going to school in a different state but assured me once she was done she would return to our home state. (This was a lie) \n\nThe relationship lasted for 8 months but a little over a year of contact was kept in total.\n\nWithout further ado, I'd like to share the event that fucked me up for almost a year and still has lingering effects on my overall happiness and emotional stability \n\nI began talking to this person well call person B around summer of 2017. I live in one state and she was going to beauty school in another. She was a year younger than me and left the state after graduating. When we first started talking the flirting began immediately. I'm in a happy relationship rn but I can't dispute that the electricity this person made me feel when talking to her was unreal. I had always respected and admired her immensely and to have her admiration felt like it was beyond comprehension. Like if the Stars or the sun or the moon themselves loved me back. (Sorry for being lame) but I started noticing a pattern early on where she would engage me sexually or emotionally on texts and would drop off the face of the earth right after things got really heavy or I would make myself vulnerable. I would get responses from her days later where she alluded to her BPD without telling me outright she had it. With cryptic statements like \"I basically don't think I deserve to be happy\" I was as understanding as possible despite having major anxiety with those kinds of things usually. Eventually we went from 2 friends with feelings for each other to boyfriend and girlfriend long distance. The first few months of the relationship while looking back had huge red flags, was at the time the relationship I felt the heaviest feelings in. In short I never fell harder for anyone since. \n\nEven my girlfriend now, while I love her to pieces I can't say I feel the raw fire I did in my chest when person B would text me. The aforementioned red flags were that even tho we were now in a romantic relationship, for the entirety of our time together she refused to give me her address. I asked her several times for it, ignoring most requests altogether and around December when we were on a break to better ourselves in therapy, she told me she couldn't give me her address so I could send her a Christmas present I had made her because she couldn't reciprocate it and she could never fully love me no matter how hard she tried, wouldn't go public with me and rarely responded to my texts and kept insisting that she would get better in therapy. At this point I had given up all hope of us ever being a real couple and anticipating how she was gonna abandon me. So I had sex with a friend I had done drugs with, feeling incredible guilt afterwards, I told her. She proceeded to treat me as if I cheated on her, calling me trash on social media. \n\n\nSome arguing and sulking later and we got back together briefly. I took some LSD, had a panic attack and she said I could call her, apparently tripped too hard and she hung up the phone and blocked me everywhere. I remember freaking out and saying fuck you, you can't do this to somebody or something babyish and entitled like that after it happened. She read this on texts and said she didn't wanna talk for a while. Like that, I found myself having wasted months of my life. Several failed attempts at communicating with her why things happened and how sorry I was later, I was in the hospital from a prescription med OD, simultaneously my infant nephew was in the ICU for the flu at a time 5 year olds were dying from it. Needless to say I was losing my shit. I could only think to message her because I was too out of it to think of anyone else. I sent any family I had with me there as my nephew didn't ask to be in the hospital, I did. She responds and says \"I was involuntarily hospitalized recently and although I hope you and your nephew are alright I don't wish to lose any progress speaking to you\" \n\n I felt so guilty for this having happened to her and immediately apologized to which she responded \"its not solely on you\" which fucked me up really bad. About a month later I put myself in rehab, go away for a month, got out and was sober for about a month and a half. We started talking again after I contacted her confused saying I thought I said I loved her too soon and I was sorry for putting serious feelings on her and that I felt I used her and apologized for it. She told me initially never to speak to her again, but after breaking down about how she blamed her hospitalization on me, she gaslighted me saying that never happened and I was assuming things again. \n\nIn short we began speaking again, and a month later she randomly reached out to me asking to meet in my state because she was visiting a friend for a week and said she wanted to see me. My heart had jumped into my throat when she said this, and I responded embarrassingly fast. We were supposed to meet the beginning of the proceeding month. But the red flags showed up again and she ignored almost every message I sent her, adding insult to injury by saying she was going thru something and it was easier to ignore everyone. (Idk, it hurt, I'm a baby) and after about 4 or 5 failed attempts at making conversation I began to feel really embarrassed I put so much into something so ridiculous and fake. \n\nThat I was so in love with somebody who didn't care about me enough to tell me where she lived but wanted to control me like we were married while on a break when her neglect was what fueled my need for intimacy in the first place. I was so embarrassed and depressed I relapsed and took a large amount of LSD. It was the most miserable trip of my life, I had ripped a button down shirt into shreds, cried for like what had to be 2 or 3 hours and wrote her a long text explaining why I no longer thought it was a good idea to meet as I felt I needed to get over some serious baggage, and mainly just communicated that it hurt me very much to be left out of her life. Immediate block everywhere, I message her on snapchat and are immediately told to never talk to her again and that I weasled my way into her life again just to make her feel like shit. What followed were several months of complete self destruction. I had began self harming worse than I ever had in my entire life. At points holding my hand over the stove for up to 5 minutes at a time. My hands and arms were really bruised and burned during that time. I had put myself in the psych ward because around August a friend grew concerned for my safety when my sister was in possession of my phone while I was attempting to admit myself for self harm and suicidal ideation.\n\n He reached out to my ex to attempt to get her to illicit some response from me so he'd be sure I didn't kill myself. I was mad at him for doing this, but what she had said in response for lack of a better phrase broke my heart to nothing. She said something to the effect that I had fucked her over countless times and she couldn't help me without feeling bitter about it and accused me of gaslighting her whenever she tried cutting me off. At that point I had started harming myself daily and sleeping almost the majority of the day. I gained at least 20 or 30 pounds and couldn't go anywhere without barely being able to hold back collapsing. She had told other people I ditched her when I told her a month in advance why I couldn't see her despite missing and loving her dearly. She also told people I had emotionally abused her. I committed myself and ended up going to several different psychiatric professionals, went thru a lot of therapy and at least 20 failed dating ventures to get where I'm at rn, living with my beautiful girlfriend across the country, I run a very large social media page for BPD related content, and I've been 10 months sober from cocaine which was my worst vice. I'm doing incredibly well in contrast to only a few months ago. \n\nAlthough I did consider hurting myself today which really scared me tbth. I had thought I made real progress but I'm wondering if I've just been faking it. I have a family member dying and between that and memories of these events, I've been breaking down when I'm alone. I guess the point of this is emotional abuse and gaslighting can mess you up well after the fact something happened and I'm coming to terms with that.\n\nTL;DR: girl I knew for years essentially catfished me except she was real and the manipulation she put me thru still affects me emotionally and mentally today to some degree.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I am just feeling weirdly lonely and without anywhere to turn despite the love and support of the people around me. I think I just need to vent. \n\nSo this past week for me was finals week. I knew it was going to be especially stressful, but I had no idea what I was completely in for. Early last week, I was lying in bed after my first night on Tinder. It was a great night nonetheless, I got quite a few matches, talked to a few people, etc etc who cares. But for some reason, I was just lying in bed and I got to thinking about the last relationship I was in and how goddamn Tinder made me feel more loved/full of affection than I've felt in a while. I came to terms with the fact that I look/feel/AM better than I ever was in said relationship. This led to a snowball of me realizing that I was verbally and emotionally abused through the course of that relationship. She yelled at me after I came out to her as bisexual, she yelled at me after she found the self-harm scars I left behind as a result of her verbally berating me one time. She just made me feel bad and wrong about my feelings a lot of the time. There's a lot more that I don't feel comfortable discussing right now. We have been broken up for about 9 months. And I'm just now acknowledging that what she put me through was abuse and it was not my fault. \n\nI feel like if this were anyone else telling me this, I would know what to say/do to help them. But since its ME feeling all of this, it just seems wrong and unjustified. Like how dare I use that dirty A-word word to describe what she did to me, you know? And I feel like that 9 month interim period was me still trying to protect her. Her image in my mind and in the minds of my friends. I told my closest friends about the shit she put me through (after hiding it all this time) and it was like a self-evident thing to them. Obviously she abused you man. Obviously she hurt you and put you through a lot. My friends have been nothing but lovely and supportive through this all, but its still odd to hear that. And that's another thing too. After talking to my friends about all of this, I'm now afraid that they feel the need to walk on eggshells with me from now on. I even opened up to them about the physical abuse my parents put me through as a kid and now I'm afraid they see me as some perpetually broken weirdo. The floodgates were opened and I don't know how to close them.\n\nI don't know. I just thought that coming to terms with abuse was supposed to be a freeing experience, but right now I just feel gross and weird and I want it to stop. I feel like the scared and trapped version of myself I was when I was with her and its making me physically ill.

He\u2019s friends with some other person and I got added to this Facebook chat with an extremely toxic friend group I\u2019m trying to get out of. He had called me some extremely demeaning insults to me in front of everyone once he found out I was added in. Everyone else basically fell into it and kept cracking jokes at my expense and basically being pieces of shit. This person was behind me in traffic one day and pulled up real close to me and death stared me. I kept driving as I would normally, trying not to give a reaction to shrug him off. My abuser also drove past my house once again on St Patrick\u2019s Day. He has a history of this behavior with everyone. He also has extremely violent tendencies and is tremendously mentally ill and regularly abuses drugs and alcohol. I\u2019m at my mental limit where I can\u2019t even concentrate on school work and I\u2019m on edge every single day worried about it. My self esteem is the worst it\u2019s ever been and I had a breakdown for about a year. Everyone ive associated with has not been supportive in the least and I really just want out. This abuser had threatened to kill me and a group of people in high school. I ended the friendship on horrible terms because I wouldn\u2019t reconcile with him when I stopped talking to him. He also said a lot of demeaning things before I blocked him. He went completely berserk and has been non stop stalking me at times, sometimes by proxy. I can\u2019t mentally do this anymore and unfortunately I don\u2019t have a job but I really need a way out of this situation because my mental health has gone down the drain and it\u2019s the worst it\u2019s ever been. I am worried that he will do something, or his friend will. Trying my hardest to compose myself and grey rock this situation but they won\u2019t leave me alone. I thought with time that this would pass and he would find a new victim but he hasn\u2019t. What do I do in this situation?

I dealt with this on a daily basis, it never let up no matter what I did and I started to become extremely depressed and desperate for something to change.\n\nIt got extremely worse when I became a sophomore in high school. The reason it got worse, I lost a bunch of weight then and slimmed down to a size 8 slim. Being a teenager dealing with not only the sexual abuse at home AND bullying in school was more than any person should be able to handle. Once I lost the weight, he started peeking in on me when I showered and the hugs were like if you had a frisky boyfriend. Instead of just wrapping his arms around me for a normal hug, he always tried to feel me up. \n\nBecause I lost this weight, I wanted to shop at some of the stores in the mall and buy things like shorter shorts and vests. Now our vests back in the early 90's, were sleeveless and most of mine were denim. I thought they were cute but it did show more skin. I had to watch every step I took and everything I wore, because I never knew when something would happen. By the end of my sophomore year, I was going through so much depression at home I decided I had to find something to get away from everything.\n\nAlice Cooper. His music was what saved me at a time when I didn't think I could go through another year at home. Yes, the abuse was still going on but once it stopped, I turned the music on and it became my shield. It gave me the strength to keep pushing in life. I have never seen him live in concert. However, my husband told me last night that no matter what we have to do, he will take me to see him in July. He is going to be close to us, well as close as possible. \n\nI didn't have any support at home, all I had was my music. I have no siblings, and not one close relative that actually cared about me at that time well other than my grandmother. The only problem there was my grandmother depended on my Mom to take her where she needed to go, so she was always afraid to make Mom mad. She wouldn't stand up against Mom but she did tell her that she didn't want my stepdad back in her house. That didn't last long though. \n\nMy music from the time I turned 12 until I left home consisted of mostly Alice Cooper. He helped me get through bullying, sexual abuse, my mother fussing at me for any thing she could find and me dealing with becoming a young adult. I could turn it on and just fade away from the world. For those hours at night when I listened to Alice, I felt normal. I felt like nothing could ever hurt me. I felt like I had something to live for and regardless of whatever happened to me I had to keep pushing on. I wish I could thank him somehow, I am sure that he has heard this story before. \n\nFor those of you out there dealing with abuse right now, try music. I know it might sound silly, but it helped me to keep pushing on in life. Those young ones if you are allowed to do so, I covered my walls in posters of Alice Cooper. I am not saying to turn to Alice, but find someone music wise that gives you courage. If you find that person that gives you courage, surround yourself with them. I had my locker covered in Alice Cooper and I would go by my locker after every class even if I didn't need to and open it. I just needed a little bit of courage to get through the day.\n\nI am 40 now and the abuse I suffered, I feel has stunted my brain from growing into a normal adult brain. I have mentioned this before. I notice it more and more every day. It has been a long time since I have had to deal with that abuse everyday, but I still deal with it mentally almost every day. If I can say one thing even though I know he won't see it, Thank you Alice Cooper. You kept me from doing something that would have kept me from being here now. You gave me the courage to fight and keep fighting every day. You are still doing that now. Thank You", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Throughout our relationship he'd occasionally make comments about my acne/weight/body hair, even when I expressed that it hurt my feelings. Similarly, he would sometimes pressure me to have sex which became a huge arguing point for us. There were several times I tried to tell him that I did not want things to go that far before we started doing anything (after having him claim that he had been too horny to realize/listen other times)... all of this made me pretty unhappy. But recently it's become physical too. He tried to strangle me while he was having a panic attack but he couldn't remember it the next day. He apologized vaguely, but did not seem to really understand until a day or two later when i lashed out/yelled at him because I was so frustrated (I had been really really scared and it felt like he was just ignoring it). We've been long distance so a month or two later after seeing him a handful more times he visited again. He was upset with me and while we were sitting together he grabbed my hair /pulled it. When he let me go he told me \"sorry but I needed to make my point.\" After he left I just totally freaked out. I had a panic attack where I could just hear his voice saying he needed to make a point while he was choking me... I feel like i might be overreacting though and I had anxiety issues before all this even. I know that he didn't really hurt me either time, but it was scary still... and it's just when i talk to him he doesn't seem to understand. And when i called him to break up he said he was so \"bewildered\" which made me feel like i was just hurting him without even any reason. What do you guys think?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

This guy, we\u2019ll call him \u2018CN\u2019, was a classmate of mine and the same age as me. Many people considered him to be hilarious, charming, and a genuinely interesting person, and at first so did I. Turns out, CN was a classic narcissist who could do no wrong but had serious double standards for less offensive behavior directed at him. It took me years to realize and come to terms with how he hurt me. \n\nCN picked on me frequently for my cultural background, for my appearance, etc. He repeatedly called me fat in a deliberate attempt to make me feel insecure about my weight, despite the fact that I was around average size. His friends used to make excuses for his behavior and I tried my best to brush it off. Not to mention his casual racism, sexism, homophobia, and antisemitism. CN was generally a poor influence and coaxed me into doing drugs with him and sneaking out of the house. On my *birthday*, he asked me to go meet him at 1 AM because he want to see me at any other time. I walked 2 hours to his house alone in the dark and the first thing he did when I arrived was insult me. \n\nWe first started having casual sex when we were both 15. After taking my virginity, he yelled at me for bleeding on his sister's bed. One time when I pointed out that he\u2019d given me a bleeding rug burn on my knees after particularly rough intercourse, he laughed and admitted he didn\u2019t care how I felt. I limped for a week afterwards. CN also asked me not to tell anyone that we were seeing each other, but I later discovered that he told explicit details from our encounters to multiple people behind my back. \n\nCN would sometimes ignore me for months seemingly randomly. He was purposely vague about the nature of our 'relationship'. After I made the mistake saying that I \u2018loved\u2019 him, he immediately wanted nothing to do with me. He proceeded to deny that we were ever friends, or that I contributed anything positive to his life. He told me his mother made fun of him for associating with me. CN messaged me the week after the last time we hooked up and tried but failed to get me to convince another girl our age, someone I used to be friends with, into having sex with him. He later subjected me to graphic recollections of their encounters. It was around this point that I cut all contact. \n\n**Fast forward to 2 years ago - I get a message from an old friend that CN has died.** He was alone - he had isolated himself from so many people that no one realized he had died and it was weeks before his body was found. Hearing this affected me in a way that I find difficult to describe. There was a sense of relief that I\u2019d never have to see him again. I had made a lot of progress moving on as I\u2018d already grieved for the lost relationship years prior. I wasn\u2019t necessarily sad... but seeing his photo is like seeing a ghost. I had to avoid social media for weeks after seeing his eulogies floating around. \n\nAnd the fucked up part? I know for a fact that he said and did some horrible things to these people posting about him in remembrance. I would never tell anyone how to grieve, but but seeing them almost... romanticizing his behavior makes me feel sick to my stomach. For a moment, I nearly believed that I was overreacting, or maybe it was just me who he mistreated. That I wasn\u2019t \u2018good enough\u2019 for him but maybe these others were. \n\nI guess I really just needed to vent. If you\u2019ve made it this far, thank you. This may have happened nearly a decade ago, but I\u2019ve only started talking about my full experience in therapy this year. Recently seeing another one of these memorial posts -with literal lighthearted references to his toxic behavior- has definitely reopened the wound. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any experience with coping with an abuser\u2019s death, I\u2019d appreciate some guidance.

And we started dating at the tail end of 2017. \nWe started 2018 with a bang, but started having issues around March 2018. \n\nEverything was fine but then he started showing his true self. I knew he had a troubled past when it came to his past relationships, hes younger than me but already divorced. And went thru a slew of women and so/so flings before seriously dating me. \nI knew he had trust issues, I knew there were some insecurities but who doesn't have them to an extent? \n\nWe took trips we met families it was everything I could've wanted until it got bad. And when it got bad it got REALLY bad. \n\nJust a few examples:\n\n\n\u2022 got mad at me for backing out of plans, with him and his friends to go get drunk (not my thing any way) to go hang out with my sister who was home from college. Said he was done with me and that I was such a disappointment. I spent the rest of the day trying to talk him down and say that I wasnt \n\n\u2022 accused me of having a more than friends relationship with one co-worker, which ended up me not talking to them for about a year\n\n\u2022said I always gave another Male co-worker a \"look\" everytime he came around\n\n\u2022 because of the \"look\" I was giving the other co-worker, he questioned the real reason why I applied for a new position, in his mind I just wanted to be closer to the other guy\n\n\n\u2022 said that me texting people around him was shady so I stopped \n\n\u2022 said keeping my phone in my bag while I was around him looked like i was trying to hide something \n\n\n\u2022 i went out of town to see my grandfather in a different state with my family, we stayed at a hotel. Later when Jim and I were out, the hotel key fell out of my wallet and I was isolated by him, in public, with his friends around for about an hr, and me just spending the time trying to explain \n\n\n\u2022 accusing me of going to another mans apartment, when all I had been doing is just unpacking my own apartment that I just moved into \n\n\n\u2022 would make plans with me, and test me to see if I remembered them, if not it started a blow up \n\n\n\u2022 placed a super high expectation on me, said I was everything and that he didnt know what he'd do if I left \n\n\n\u2022 while out with friends for a celebration of my bday, accused me of flirting with the DJ and said I was trying to cheat because i gave him my Instagram handle along with my other friends \n\n\n\u2022 made me feel bad about wanting alone time, and had me to the point that pretty much every day after work I'd be over his place until late, and have to drive 40mins back home (before i moved), and had to spend like every weekend together \n\n\n\u2022 (idk why this always bothered me but it did) could only really have sex with me while drunk damn near inebriated. I asked and he said it was because he felt more comfortable? Idk \n\nIt all came to a head last September/October I went up to see my sister at her school for their homecoming. Him and I just came down from a huge fight the week before so were were pretty rocky , I saw him the night before I left. And showed him what I'd be wearing (I can link it if necessary) but it was a olive green body suit from forever 21, that I'd be wearing with Jeans and heels. He was quiet. We continued talking and he said good night. \nThat whole weekend was filled with texts of him saying he was nervous about me being up there. And he constantly needed reassurance that I loved him. \n\nI had enough, what was meant to be a good weekend with my sister ended up with me crying trying to tell him to stop with the craziness and calm down. Eventually asking him to stop texting me. \n\nThat Sunday, we broke up. Major screaming match over the phone. He called me a cunt and a bitch for the way I was acting that weekend. Said I was being a slut with my sister somewhere and that I went out of town to get away from him so I could meet someone else. He was drunk beyond belief, and it was waves of him being mad at me to him crying, begging me not to do this. To threatening to come to my apartment.\n\nI was terrified. The next morning it was texts of him saying that we'd both regret this if we let it happen. That I absolutely broke him. And that I'd feel an emptiness in me like I had before when we broke up.  I remained strong and followed thru. \n\nHe missed worked and went on like a 4 day long binge of alcohol and drugs. I know this because hes done it before when we took a \"break\".\n\nMonths later, I'm in a new relationship, and I cant stop thinking about him. It like haunts me. Him and I got to the place where we were cool but now I've blocked him on everything. He still wants to be friends, we still love one another to an extent, and hes in a new relationship as well (not surprisingly). \n\nWhy does this man who literally stressed and exhausted me to the point where my hair all but fell out, had me thinking I was insane plague my mind?! \nWhy do I still care, and give a damn if hes alright? Why do I care if he still cares? I just got to the point where I stopped blaming myself but every now and again I feel bad for not maybe hearing him out that night?

OR even the vague themes of these conversations.\n\n1. When he met a girl in a bar, twice, and apparently they really bonded over their 'hard lives' and she went to him for advice about it. I only found out about her after a discard and him coming back to me, it had been going on for months. He told me that I should be grateful to her because he spoke to her a lot ABOUT ME and then eventually decided to talk to me again. I asked him to please tell me what kind of things they were talking about for months, because this sounds suspicious. Particularly because it came at a time where he told me he couldn't spend any time talking to me because he didn't feel like talking :) He told me it was private and he didn't want to say.\n2. Okay this one bothers me way more. His ex, the one that was always around and he didn't seem to be over. In a discard phase, (or perhaps it triggered the discard phase), she apparently came back to him and they started talking. Now, he told me, that because of how she was, it started rekindling old feelings for her - to the point that he questioned the feelings he had for me. (ps. he changed his story about whether this was pre or after discard, sooo....). He said they TALKED IT THROUGH. He also said that he mentioned me (but not by name). And eventually came to the conclusion that he didn't want her. However! When I begged him to at least vaguely tell me what kind of things were said - ie. would I count this emotional cheating? Did you confess your feelings? Did you have phone sex (as you do with me in similar scenarios). His answer? \"My dick wasn't in her so what are you being insecure about?\" Of course this was of ZERO reassurance to me as we were online and long distance so he never slept with me either, but we would have phone sex and obviously talk about our feelings for one another. So if he was doing this with her it would not be cool.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, as much as I begged just for VAGUE ideas of what was discussed, because it sounded very VERY relevant to me, even about me, his excuse was that these were private conversations and he would not tell me. I should just be reassured by the fact that he is talking to me now, and stop focussing on what was happening/is happening.\n\nI even explained about emotional cheating to which he essentially laughed in my face and told me that wasn't a thing (in a long distance relationship where we had no physical contact). He really made fun of the concept\n\nHe would tell me I had no right to know, it didn't matter, he respected the privacy. etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt drove me insane because I obsessed, and continue to, about what was said. However he offered me no clarity on the situation, and would just leave me to wonder, piecing together things that made the whole thing sound very much like emotional cheating at the very least.\n\nThe thing is, surely it is my right to decide what I'm comfortable with or not? I believe emotional cheating is definitely a thing (pretty sure he physically cheated, too), but he was just saying that because there was no physical contact I had no right to even ask. Like?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm kind of more bothered by the ex thing so if anyone could maybe shed some light on it?\n\nIs it that he KNEW that he was crossing a line with his ex and didn't want to tell me? Does this confirm the cheating?\n\nWas he trying to leave me in the dark so I felt horribly insecure because how could he not know how awful it felt to not even have a vague idea of the kinds of things he was saying to other girls?\n\nDid he just not want to tell me? Was he trying to make me feel bad for asking?\n\n... but then WHY give me enough details to make me worry? It wasn't like he said, \"oh we just had a random conversation about nothing\", he specifically said it was about feelings etc. But not to worry. HOW could I not worry? Feelings as in, \"I don't have feelings for you\", or feelings as in \"I'm so conflicted, lets have phone sex and I'll tell you I love you and then discard you again because you're crazy\" (which is how our conversations went)\n\nLike, omitting is one thing, but to give me just enough to drive me crazy?\n\nAnd then he would complain that I was obsessing over it, that I kept asking, he told me he hated it that I wouldn't \"let it go\". And I'm like, well if it's bothering you so much that I'm asking why not give me some clarity on it? Thats all I was asking.... I was his girlfriend after all, why do I not matter?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't get it. I didn't leave, just sat around crying and wondering and obsessing and never getting answers.

I went on government funding for a few months to help with money, but it wasn't enough to pay my way.\n\nI've been consistently falling behind in my finances, my partner has been covering the costs for his mortgage, power, internet and other expenses until I get enough to money in my account to send to him each month, which is less than what I owe. \n\nI currently owe him ~$2,500.00\nAnd this is continuing to increase every month. By about $100-600 depending on our power bill.\n\n Jake's a hobby horticulturist and he covers the cost of his own projects, excepting for the power bill which I am to pay half and sometimes in the winter is $600/month. - I pay half because I benefit from the project by consuming the product - I have recently been trying to stop consuming, but it is hard to do so in this environment (excuses, excuses. I know and I am working on it. Actively trying to quit))\n\nWe both work for his father, so if we get into arguments or I have a bad day mental health day then I miss out on work. If his dad doesn't feel like working we miss work.  \n\nJake and his father are co-owners of our residence.  Last year, Jake's father financed the build of our garage on the basis that he will be using a large portion of it for his businesses storage.  We built the garage ourselves and put in a lot of man hours and effort mostly under direction of Jake's father to get it together.  Not working other work while building the garage. The briefly discussed method of paying him back will be us working for free a few hours here and there and him tracking it and telling us when we are done paying him.\n\nI built a garage which will be mine if my partner and I ever decided to get married, which is unknown. I'm going to be working a certain unknown number of hours to pay him back for work I did on his garage (potentially one day partly mine... But if anything goes wrong with our relationship- then what?) \n\nAm I being a selfish greedy person for thinking about the \"if something goes wrong, then what what about me?\" Should I consider the time and effort as though it's owed to him anyway?\n\nI feel that I have been in the red since moving out here. Feeling like I owe everyone anything they ask because I decided to come and be here and this is what is expected in his family.  \n\nI'm being given things without the option of accepting or declining and feeling stamped with a big ass \"you owe me\" over my head all the time.\nFrom another perspective I should be very grateful that these people are helping me in ways that I would never ever ask of another person. But. I cannot help but feel like I am trapped Ina cycle of owing whenever they give. They give making sure I know it's more than what they should. \n\nI felt ashamed everytime that I did something \"leisurely\" for myself since I moved.  It seems the only acceptable thing for me to do, aside from working and cleaning, or building a relationship with Jake's mother, was going to therapy. \n\nI haven't felt free will in a long time.  My personal goals and interests aren't considered in the running of our lives or our future goals.  Jakes father's goal is for us to be \"set up\" before he passes. That's his life goal, to make sure his kids get and do better than him. A great guy. Jake follows his father wholeheartedly.\n\nI am having a lot of trouble doing that.  When I fell apart last year I was unable to keep my end of the bargain in a lot of ways and I was met with silence and disappointment, hints to find other work and hints to go home for the day, hints that I was taking advantage, disrespectful and lazy. I was met with anger from my partner when I was falling apart and he felt lost. I can't say it wasn't deserved, because I was broken and depressed and a real bummer to be around and not holding myself up.  I feel that if Jake's father was tired of me Jake would drop me no problem. \n\n\nI found a different job for this summer which will pay me less, but it is an independent source of income. And may provide time to focus on a different craft while I am on call, possibly able to have a second income source.\nThis may help me pay him back, and that may help me to feel less trapped and obligated.\n\nI'm not sure what advice I am looking for - likely why my life is a wishy washy mess. \n\nI'm open to other perspectives, ideas thoughts whatever. I'm feeling stuck and than I need other, healthier peoples inputs\n\n\n\n\n ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

My apologies for the length. TL/DR at end. I want to say first off, as of July,1 2018 he no longer lives in the home. The state I live in requires a couple to be separated for 1 year prior to petitioning the court for a divorce IF they have children together. So I have not filed for divorce, I am however planning to. SOME BACKGROUND: So, this whole relationship was tumultuous at best. I met him when my oldest was 2 (she\u2019s almost 14 now). I had super low self esteem due to childhood sexual abuse and trauma and I had decided I was only going to have one other father to my children and I was adamant about having the rest of my children before turning 30. I was looking to settle down when I met him. He was looking for a way out of the city he had spent most of his life. There were a lot of red flags from the very very beginning and in retrospect I should have walked away or let him walk away a thousand times before it finally happened, but due to my own past and experiences I was lulled into thinking this is what I deserved.\nI am not going to get into every detail of every physical or verbal altercation. I am going to give you the highlights.\n2008- He grabs me by my throat and has me bent back over a balcony with a 30 ft drop.\n2010- I wake up to him threatening to drown our 2 month old in the toilet because he wouldn\u2019t stop crying (he was premature, emergency C-section and had colic) I grab the baby, he tries to grab him back, I back up, he pushes me into a sliding glass door with the baby in my arms\n2012- CPS gets involved due to my mother or one of her friends reporting that husband threw my then 2 yr old (Same kid from the 2010 incident) on to a bed leaving marks on his arms and a bump on the head (I was not in the room or even at home when this incident happened, I was working and pregnant with my 3rd child) He coached the oldest (she was 7 at the time) on what to say to CPS and the investigation was closed.\n2013 (approx. I don\u2019t really remember the year it could have been 2014)- He flies into a rage threatens to commit suicide (mind you he has done this periodically throughout the relationship but mostly I chalked it up to attention seeking behavior and became so desensitized to the threat I didn\u2019t react) Our children were home. He drinks a full mason jar of moonshine, and half a bottle of advil. Once he was out of it enough that the threat of physical harm to me or the kids was diminished I called 911 and the ambulance and police came, they took him to the hospital and he was admitted to the psych ward (he spent a week in patient, and was diagnosed with Schizophrenia and various other physical health issues) The police spoke to my daughter who was 8 at the time and she explained that she and her brothers had been instructed by me to go upstairs and stay in her room until directed otherwise but they \u201cheard everything\u201d\nEnd of 2013 I was pregnant with the youngest boy, the husband had accused me of cheating repeatedly, and I refused to let him see my phone. He became livid and began choking me and tried to smother me with a pillow (I sleep with a knife under my pillow due to my traumatic past) I pulled the knife out from under the pillow and cut him on the hand. He went to the bathroom (dripping blood all over the floor and the door to the bedroom) and proceeded to cut his hair off (I had been twisting his dreads for 5 yrs) which I viewed as direct disrespect to all the hard work I had put into maintaining his hair. (but once again that was the LEAST of my issues)\n2014- I have the baby boy, everything seemed to be back to \u201cnormal\u201d but I started having panic attacks. 2 to 4 times a month, hyperventilating, racing heart beat, body shaking, thought I was having a stroke panic attacks.\n2015- I got a new job, that paid more but was also way more demanding on my time. He continues to accuse me of cheating and/or caring more about making money than being with my family. (mind you the whole relationship he has not kept steady employment and I\u2019ve been working almost constantly to support the family)\n2016- while cooking in the kitchen he grabs me by the throat and pins me against the back door, he puts a chef knife in my hand and tells me to just \u201cgo ahead and kill me, I know you want me dead\u201d I refused, repeatedly and the grip on my neck just got tighter, THE only thing that kept me alive was that my daughter walked into the kitchen and he let go. He left for work, I called the cops, I filed charges, they picked him up from work, he was out the same night and staying with one of his coworkers. I FELT COMPLETELY demoralized and I was convinced he was going to come do something stupid. Next day, I filed a restraining order, but NEVER included the kids in the restraining order ONLY me. His father moved in with me to help out with the kids a month later or so and facilitated him seeing the kids (WITH MY FATHER IN LAWS\u2019 supervision). Prior to the court date, I wrote him a 9 page letter basicly outlining all the things that had happened in our relationship and trying to show him/tell him where I was with the relationship, at the end I told him \u201cI\u2019m done trying. I\u2019m done waiting for you to wake up. I\u2019m just done. You had your chance to make this work, more than a few chances\u2026 and your own decisions have gotten us where we are. You want to keep forcing my hand to make a decision instead of doing everything in your power to CONVINCE me that being with you isn\u2019t going to continue to be detrimental to my physical and mental health. So since you want a decision right now, as things stand\u2026 right this moment if you ask me to make a decision I\u2019m finished I\u2019m done I want OUT. I want to be happy and healthy and there is nothing healthy about our relationship. Don't give me the horse shit of you asked me about all this to \u201cjust know if we could work on anything\u201d because the reality is\u2026 YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WORKING ON STUFF.. This letter gave you the fucking outline of what to do and how to do it\u2026. You either shit or get off the pot\u2026and I\u2019ve given you years to figure out how to shit\u2026. So now I have to make the hard decision to get you off the pot\u2026. \u201c\nI went to court, and all he got was probation and anger management classes. I felt completely defeated, and like the punishment did not match the crimes at ALL\u2026. Fast forward to the spring of 2017 I got talked into \u201ctalking to him\u201d again by his father. I spoke with him and observed what I perceived to be a sincere change in behavior. Within about a month of that conversation he moved back into the house. At first everything was good, no yelling or suicide talk, no accusations of cheating when I had to stay late at work. Then all of a sudden he was accusing me of having sex with his father, and pretty much anyone else with a pulse, but when I tried to confront him about the accusations with his father present he tried to make me seem crazy. Things escalated, and in May of 2018 I asked him to move out, and gave him 60 days to find new housing. He moved out as of July 1\u2026.\nSince he has left the house I have been the sole provided of the 4 kids, taking care of the majority of the bills (he has paid the phone bill 2x and the utility bill 2x that I am aware of). The agreement when he moved out was that he was going to pay the phone bill and the water/gas and I would take care of the electricity and rent and food for the house. He let the utilities go to the point people were in my front yard about to cut off my water. I PAID TO KEEP IT ON, he has never paid me back for that or any of the other times I paid the phone bill to ensure we could communicate. I have never asked him for cash or child support, and I allow him to talk to/see the kids whenever he wants (with supervision, which he\u2019s not too happy about but, as you can see above that\u2019s why) Every single time I bring up anything I need for the kids its always some excuse or bs reason why he can\u2019t help out or doesn\u2019t have any money. He makes seemingly out of place advances towards me (asked if I wanted oral sex on my birthday even though we hadn\u2019t been intimate since May or June?). He has been increasingly moody and I noticed him using the same tactics he has used in the past to make me feel bad and \u201ctake him back\u201d. Now to the present\u2026. He has stage 4 kidney failure, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. We found all that out approximately 5 years ago. The doctors at that time gave him 2-5 years to live if he didn\u2019t seek treatment or follow doctors advice. He\u2019s still alive\u2026. Obviously. \nWell here goes my guilt.\nI was raised in a super religious environment and taught that marriage is a sacred vow before God.\nDivorce was always demonized in my family (especially if the other spouse was sick)\nI know I\u2019ve been kind and understanding and have done everything I can think of to save the marriage (I told him we needed to go to marriage therapy but that I WOULD NOT find the therapist, because I needed him to show interest in repairing the marriage) but I still get the guilt trip from him, his mother and other family members that I\u2019m \u201cgiving up\u201d (please bear in mind these same people giving me shit have been divorced and remarried at least 2 times a piece and often times for WAY less serious actions than what their son/grandson has done)\nI know he\u2019s going through tough end of life things and I feel sorry for him but at the same time I feel like he dug his own grave, he made his own bed, he hung himself, so this is kinda what he gets. There is still part of me that just wants to see him get his shit together and act like a human being.\nI do not love him, I do care about his well-being, mostly because of my kids. I just feel guilty for the timing. I need some encouraging words or reassurance that I\u2019m doing what\u2019s right for myself and my babies. \nTL/DR: My (34/f) husband (35/m) has been abusive both physically and mentally for years, I finally got up the courage to kick him out last July, but now I\u2019m feeling guilty because he is terminally ill, and even though I know what I am doing is right for my kids and myself, I still hate the idea of anyone being alone when they are dying. I feel like he\u2019s trying to gaslight and pity party me back into his life, and I\u2019m not sure how to cope with all the conflicting emotions.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I have been together with my girlfriend about roughly a year. I have quite a lot of negative experience and honestly I am afraid of the past repeating itself. My ex girlfriend of almost ten years lied to me, manipulated me and betrayed me, calling me crazy for \"assuming something\" due to her obvious change in behaviour and at times I actually thougtht I was the crazy one like she suggested me to be. Up until I catched her with her pants down with exactly the guy I assumed it to be... \n\nMy current girlfriend knockted me out of my socks. She is one of the most beautiful women I have ever met. So driven, intelligent, witty and funny too, quite the package. A real catch. On the surface it was and is too good to be true. What scared me though was the idealization in the beginning - she told me how handsome, smart, funny and whatnot I am... She was so in love, we spent almost every day together. And I? Well, of course I was totally in love too with such a stunning woman by my side that keeps telling me how great I am.\n\nBut at the same time, I remember how this idealization kind of put me off since my ex did that too. Up until she started to devalue me. And well, guess what? My current girlfriend does that too. For minor things even, little disagreements that don't really make sense to me.\n\nAnd then she told me during conflict that she feels reminded about her past relationship: that she feels easily annoyed by me, that she doesn't answer right away anymore when I write or call, that she can't laugh about my jokes like she used to - and she wonders what might be wrong with her, why this keeps repeating. So... Well, the insight that there might be a problem on her side gives me hope.\n\nI am a bit of a clingy man, I have to admit that. And well, she is obviously enjoying her independence and personal space. In more specific terms it's totally obvious that her attachment style is dismissive and mine is of anxious nature. Sometimes I like to tell myself that this is the \"only\" problem we have.\n\nBut then, there are other things. For instance, how the relationship with her ex ended. We were quite open about our romantic past and things she has told me scare me to say the least. She let me know that he was \"treating her bad\" without going into specifics that would explain it and then goes on to tell me she treated him completely indifferently in the end, cold and withholding - sort of on purpose. Not talking to him, ignoring him, not touching him. She did it until he broke apart and completely lost it (of course when her family was present).\n\nThen she went on to have sex with him for one last time, made herself cum using him and left his place for good - it was the last time they saw each other.\n\nShe put it in a way that sounded as if it felt good to her to treat him like that. The even scarier bit is that she once emphasized how she can see that she is hurting me and she wants to know when she makes me feel bad... And when I actually do so, I feel like she doesn't really change her behaviour but only wants to know which buttons to press.\n\nOnly when I clearly make her understand that I am not to be taken for granted and thus go for distance she kind of realizes that she has to make efforts too and chases me. It's when she feels that she can lose me that she actually does care.\n\nFor the rest, I am the chaser in our relationship. I treat her like a queen, massage her, completely spoil her sexually, cook for her when she is my guest and the list goes on. And she even says that she \"gets lazy with giving after a while\", lets me know that \"she is just like that\", and doesn't know if she can ever change. And well, she also let me know that the times we meet have to be on her schedule and it simply has to be that way. Basically: her way or the highway.\n\nAs if this wasn't enough she let me know that she sometimes has \"the tingles\" for other men and that this is just her nature ...\n\nWriting these words makes me realize how self-absorbed she is.\n\nSometimes she tells me to not spoil her, that she would also love me if I didn't treat her like that, that she wants me to put myself first and take better care of myself - which is something I appreciate. And that she is not jealous in any way - that she would forgive me if \"something happened\" with another woman - that bit confused me.\n\nShe doesn't really make sense in many regards. It's as if her opinions change as does the wind. One day an open relationship sounds like the best thing there is, the next day she holds my hand and tells me that she only wants me with tears in her eyes.\n\nShe completely sabotaged her previous relationship and does the same at times with ours - it is totally painful to go through these cycles of idealization and devaluation - she seems to see everything as either black or white with not much in between.\n\nAnd then there are the beautiful moments. When we just cook something, watch TV series without a care in the world, go on vacation, go for long walks, go shopping, ... Being careless. And the sex? Unlike anything I EVER experienced - believe me. She is addicting in so many ways and I simply am clueless what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is actually kind of painful to write so many negative things about the woman I love. Because, well, during our good moments she is unbelievably lovely and simply adorable. She can be really caring and simply cute. Sometimes all I want to do is kiss her forehead and hug her all day to make her feel good, but I am afraid even though sometimes she really loves to cuddle and seeks being close, other times she can't stand it at all - which further adds to my confusion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe red flags, are they really that obvious or am I just trying to explain the hurt by finding faults in others? Am I sabotaging myself? Am I actually afraid of getting close? Is this why I chose a partner that is of dismissive nature? Is it really just the good old tale of commitment phobia on both ends that shows differently or am I dealing with a malignant narcissist or a woman that has a fair share of BPD traits?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo many bold questions.\n\nSometimes I wonder whether I am just too sensitive for a \"complicated woman\" with a dismissive attachment style like hers. After all, there is so much to read about the \"anxious avoidant trap\" and I think it really makes sense.\n\nIF it is \"just that\", I am really willing to work on it. But part of me is afraid that there lies a dark personality that gets off by hurting those closest to her without even realizing it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo be frank, I am well aware that I have some issues on my side. Low self-esteem for starters. I am seeing a shrink every other week and lately I have been talking quite a lot about these issues... My friends are already annoyed by my constant moaning and sometimes I am afraid that I am losing it.\n\nIs it another red flag that I feel so lost and vulnerable by her side? All my friends think I am the luckiest man on earth and that I have nothing to complain about, but they don't see how she sometimes acts behind closed doors. How cold and controlling she can be ... I have to admit that I feel unbelieveably preoccupied, it simply isn't of any good for me to constantly think about her. And the way she treats me with constant hot and cold showers is not helping in any way.\n\nIs there anyone out there that can shed some light onto these issues? It might sound ridiculous, but I feel like I read every single article/study there is on attachment styles, attachment wounds, personality disorders and whatnot and still don't have ANY clue what is going on in my life.\n\nIt is frustrating to say the least. I would truly appreciate any input. Thanks to those who read up until this point!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I have a few of me as a toddler, a few more in elementary school &amp; so on.  No one ever really wanted to take a picture of me, and as I grew up it just became my normal.  As an adult I've also not taken a lot of pictures of myself.  It's just how it's always been, and it's always bothered me but I haven't been ready to admit it or face it until the last year or so.  \n\nA couple issues this has caused in particular that I'd really love insight on:\n\n1)   I don't really \\*know\\* what I look like.  I rarely recognize a photo of myself right away, and I don't really use mirrors to see all of me - just whatever part I need to see to do what I need to do.  I've been told this is body dysmorphia, but I don't know how to learn to recognize myself and reconcile \"me\" with what I see.  I guess I kind of just avoid seeing myself unless I have to.\n\n2)  I don't participate in pictures.  I would love to have pictures with friends and family, but cameras (phones?) never seem to come out when I'm around, and I'm not great at realizing when would be a good time to take them.  If I think about it, I get embarrassed &amp; anxious about wanting a picture of myself with someone, and end of too nervous to ask.  I've tried to break the ice by taking pictures of just other people, but it doesn't seem like it's something that's naturally reciprocated in that situation, and I end up so confused!!\n\n3) I feel hurt and left out seeing all the pictures of loved ones that are shared on social media.  It's bad enough that I have to see my estranged parents posting pictures and loving messages to siblings that I still talk to.  It hurts so much that people involved in my life don't post pictures of me with them or anything of the sort, but they do post pictures of others in their life.

I was a vulnerable person at that age, I was suffering from bipolar disorder, and I was living in an abusive home with people that hardly ever showed me love. I would cry myself to sleep because of how alone I felt. So when I met this guy, I figured it was better than being alone. I never cared about him, I never loved him, but he made me believe I did. He groomed me, making friends with me at first, and then coercing me into starting a relationship with him. I never wanted to, but he said he'd leave me if I didn't, and I was so afraid of being alone again that I agreed to begin a relationship with him. Throughout the three years that he was with me, he abused me. It started off small, it started off with him wanting most of my time, sending me texts all the time, making me feel bad for not texting back or spending all my time with him. Then it progressively got worse... He would tell me he loved me, but then point out everything he didn't like, he tore me down and made me hate myself. He would fight with me over everything, make me feel like I was young and stupid, creating a place of power for himself over me. He'd make me feel young and stupid, but he'd call me a woman (which I wasn't) and blame me for not acting like one. He'd blow up my phone every minute of everyday, stay up late at night just so that he could continue to text me and know what I was doing at every moment of every day. He'd make me feel bad for going out and making friends, and when I went out he'd blow up my phone and make me answer, threatening to leave me if I didn't. He'd harass me so bad that I would cry in public and in front of my friends who could already see how toxic he was. He'd call -me- selfish, and make me feel guilty for wanting to live my life. When I went to university he would beg me not to go out with friends, he'd beg me to not go to class, he'd beg me to not go home on weekends. He would get livid if I didn't text him back within two minutes every time he texted me (which was a lot). He badgered me constantly about sending him nudes, even before I was legal. He threatened to leave me, threatened to ruin my life if I didn't. He tried to make me comfortable with him, trying to lull me into a sense of false security. After a while I got so tired of the hell, that I did send him stuff. He'd go on and on about how perfect I was, but inside I felt so fucking horrible and dirty and exposed. He then went on to take it a step further,  coercing me to video call with him and do things for him so that he could masturbate to me. I still get flashbacks about this. He'd send me photos of himself, make me watch him shower, and make me watch him touch himself. When I tried to break up with him (which I tried to do a lot) he'd threaten to kill himself, and then he'd get his friends to harass me and badger me into staying. He'd spend money on me without asking if it was okay, and then he'd make me feel guilty and like I owed him. He made me think that he loved me, he was obsessed with me, saying that we'd be married one day, and that we'd have children together. He'd find something sexual in anything I did. He'd convince me to flash him, and send him photos. He convinced me to masturbate with him, no matter how much it hurt or how much I bled. He didn't care, it was almost as if he liked seeing me in pain. He isolated me from my friends, never letting me have a second of peace to myself. He didn't care how sick I got, and when I had a kidney infection, he still wanted me to help get him off despite being so fucking sick I felt like I was going to die. He'd cry if he didn't get his way, sobbing between insults that he flung my way. He called me heartless, selfish, a cold bitch. He said that no one would ever love me, and that I was unworthy of love. He convinced me that I would be miserable without him, he convinced me that I would be so lonely and depressed that I would kill myself. He said he wanted to save me. He said he didn't want me to die. He insulted my family, he drove a rift between me and my father, my mother, and my uncles. He said that my mother didn't love me, he said my father was creepy and made me believe it, he said that my uncles were sick. He made me fear that they would hurt me. He twisted my mind around to think that my family would hurt me, or abuse me, or sexually assault me because I was just \"that beautiful\". For the last year that I was with him, he made me have a call going at all times in my room. He got incredibly upset if I stopped the call or needed time for myself. He made me sleep on a skype call, and sometimes masturbated to my sleeping body. He got upset when I dreamed or made sounds in my sleep, thinking that I was dreaming of other men. He began to become very jealous. Not letting me play video games if he wasn't there, not letting me talk to people if he didn't know them, not letting me use snapchat, or facebook, or whisper app. He would constantly ask if I was cheating on him, he would badger me about other people, he would try to find proof that I was cheating. He was obsessed with my virginity, and was adamant on being the one to take it. He said he'd know if I had slept with someone else when he would first have sex with me in person. He instilled fear in me, saying that if I had that he would ruin my life. I was a virgin and still am, but he made me scared anyways. He convinced me that sex would hurt, and that if it didn't hurt then I had done it before. He said he didn't want to use a condom, and he said that he wanted to make me his forever (Impregnate me). He said he could give me anything I ever wanted, and that I'd be happy with him. He said that his friends could be my friends, and he said that I would never make any friends on my own. He made me feel like being alone was a sin, and that I couldn't love myself and couldn't find company with myself alone. He embarrassed me in front of others, saying sexual things about me and implying horrible things that I didn't want others to know. He blamed my bipolar for wanting to break up with him, and he constantly called me crazy. He said that he was the only one that could love me the way I was, he made me feel like I had to hide my mental illness or I'd never be loved. He took so much from me, my time, my childhood, my innocence, my freedom, my self respect, and my life. He spiraled me into a depression, a depression so bad that I couldn't carry on with my schooling and I had to drop out. He told me to stop taking my meds, convincing me that they were making me worse. And so I spiraled some more. He never loved anything about me, but enjoyed the idea of me. He made me feel mediocre and ordinary. He hated my talents. He convinced me that I wasn't bisexual, and made me repress that side of myself. He drove me into a dark place. I felt more alone than I had ever felt in my entire life, I felt like I was nothing. I felt used, and abused. I felt like his own personal prostitute. I felt like I was nothing. I was nothing. My mother had begged me over and over to get out, but I was so far into this hole that I didn't feel like I could drag myself out. I didn't feel like I had an abuser. At that point I was convinced it was normal. He began to control what I wore, telling me to wear sexy things for him, but wear turtlenecks in public (basically). He told me not to wear makeup, he told me not to cut my hair, he told me to wear baggy clothes. He didn't even like me eating, because that was a moment I would be away from him. Near the end of it all, I got so bad that I went into the hospital and was admitted to a psych ward. I wanted to kill myself. Being in the psych ward was the best thing that ever happened to me, and I'll be thankful every day of the people who helped me get there. I will be grateful for my uncle every day of my life, I will be in his debt forever. He saved my life by taking me in. He was that person I could trust in a moment of need, and he proved to me that people did care. In the psych ward I couldn't talk to my abuser, I couldn't call him, I couldn't text him, and he couldn't get a hold of me either. It was a week alone, a week of self evaluation, and a week of recovery. I got back on some new medication, and I got put into an outpatient day program to begin my recovery. I didn't have the strength to end the relationship right away, it kept on for a little while after I had left the psych ward. But I wasn't really answering his texts anymore, I was not calling him anymore, and I was not talking to him as much as I used to. He tried to suck me back in, but I realized that my life was so much worse with him in it. So I ended things. I went to my day program one morning, and I had an epiphany. I sent him a text and said I wanted out. It was a huge fight, but I had people supporting me through it, and I ended it officially. He has tried to get a hold of me a few times since, and has threatened to sell my nudes and ruin my life. But he doesn't have that sort of power over me anymore. I finally feel free. It took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I had an abuser. It took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I had been groomed by a pedophile. And it took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I had been sexually abused. But I have. It's been a long journey, but I finally am free of him and feel like I can wash my hands of the situation. I am now happy with being alone, and I treasure every moment of it. I have reconnected with old friends and made new ones in the process. I'm going back to school for music, and I am finally living my life for me. My bipolar disorder is managed now, and I'm taking my medication regularly. I'm finally in a good spot, but I still have a long way to go. If there's anyone out there that has been through something like this, or is going through it right now, I want you to know that it will be okay and it will get better. You are worthy of love, proper love. You are amazing, beautiful, and strong. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\n(If anyone wants to talk to me about their story, or needs advice on getting out of online abuse. Send me a pm.

I\u2019ve only been NC for a few days but every time I get the urge to talk with him I come here and it helps he feel better and gives me a little dose of reality.\n\nMy next had some very typical behaviors. He described himself as an empath, however when I\u2019d speak about how his actions made me feel, he\u2019d become angry.  We were together about a year. He rushed moving in together. When I asked him to take it slow he said he should just Take the offer back because I wasn\u2019t taking him seriously.\n\nHe didn\u2019t accompany me to the doctor when I decided to terminate the pregnancy.  He was too busy with work.  I asked him repeatedly his thoughts and feelings throughout the process, even bringing him to a session with my therapist to process his own feelings, and he just repeatedly said how he wanted it all to be over. He recently started going to a therapist and in a hoovering attempt he told me that he was frustrated I never asked him how he felt during this, or asked him what to do about the pregnancy.  Here\u2019s the thing though: I knew I wasn\u2019t ready for that. I asked him his feelings and thoughts, but also knew his rampant substance abuse wouldn\u2019t make a great environment for a child.  He spent all his savings on coke, concerts, alcohol, and weed.  He said at one point to me he wishes I would have gone through with it because it would have made him calm down and stop doing those things.  I told him if he\u2019s not capable of change now; how would a child change that?\n\nHe didn\u2019t drive me to the hospital when I had acute appendicitis because when he first moved to this city he \u201cdidn\u2019t have anyone to help him\u201d so I need to learn that and be a \u201cbig girl\u201d.  We lived together and he was \u201ctoo tired\u201d because he had taken a Benadryl a few hours before. The hospital was about a mile away. I ended up driving myself. Going into surgery without anyone there. He didn\u2019t pick up his phone for hours, knowing fully I was in the ER. My parents indicated concern for this and I gave them so many excuses for him. In the end he came and grabbed me from the hospital, but decided to go to a concert that night and get all coked out. At the end of it all he said he was proud of me for doing it myself. I felt really alone.\n\nHe got mad at me for giving one of my best friends a hug when I met up with him to introduce him to my nex. He immediately accused me of sleeping with said friend (we\u2019ve never/never would).  All the while he carried on an emotional relationship with an ex (which to him wasn\u2019t a big deal).  I stopped trusting him when this happened.\n\nWhen I\u2019d ask him to clean up after himself, to help around the house, he\u2019d say I was nagging and critical. He\u2019d then shut down. It was impossible to have any conversation about anything that was bothering me because he\u2019d take it very critically and get very defensive. He\u2019d say he was so giving, so loving, but his indifference and lack of work on the relationship said otherwise.  He\u2019d give me the silent treatment when mad, would say I said thinks like \u201cfuck you\u201d when I didn\u2019t. He made me doubt my memory and my self worth.  One night he didn\u2019t come home and didn\u2019t answer his phone. He went to a stripe club and spent 700 dollars. I\u2019m considering getting an STD screen now.\n\nAfter we broke up, he accused me of \u201cblowing shit up\u201d because I sought support from friends and family.  When he hoovered me he\u2019d say how much he loves me, but he was more concerned about what my parents would think of him as opposed to remorse over how he treated me.  He managed to rope me back in a few times. \n\nI hate that I spent a year of my life trying to make this person happy. He\u2019s since said I was never happy and that I was the one who never let him have any fun. He\u2019d threaten breaking up the relationship whenever he was upset. The final time he did it while he was away, I packed my shit up and gtfo. He didn\u2019t think I\u2019d do it but I did. Because to him, his word, his actions,were not meant to be taken seriously.  I\u2019ve always been taught: say what you mean and mean what you say. He just didn\u2019t give a shit. \n\nThe last time I truly went no contact. He invited me over for yoga and dinner, and proceeded to spend most of it on his phone and avoiding eye contact/giving one word answers. He didn\u2019t seem happy I was there. I said I\u2019d leave if he didn\u2019t want it and he said ya idk why I thought it\u2019d work. I asked him to not contact me unless he thinks through what he\u2019s asking me, because he clearly did not. He just wanted affection, sex, whatever.  He said my standards were too high, and maybe they are. But it just seems to me he thinks bare minimum work is treating someone like a princess (eyeroll).  I ended up calling him a man child (I never have called partners names before and I felt bad about this after) and told him to never contact me again. \n\nIt hurts but I spent the weekend going out with friends and keeping myself busy. It felt good. Yeah still have moments where I want to reach out but I try to remind myself of all of these shitty things he did when  that happens. I come here for validation that yes, he did have narc tendencies and that I\u2019m not crazy.   I\u2019m allowing myself to feel sad, and also welcoming this opportunity to grow and meet new people.

It\u2019s been a rough year; last semester I failed one class and barely passed the rest, landing me on academic probation. Now I\u2019m making better grades in most of my classes, but I\u2019m failing another one\u2014extremely hard. I\u2019m also Autistic, so part of my struggle can be chalked up to consequences of this, as well as my having a hard time adjusting to a totally new support network.\n\nMy mom has basically been set up to become an Autism Mom \u2122\u2014like a helicopter parent, but more stifling:\n- She got sole custody of me when she and my dad got a divorce (in which she royally fucked him over once of several times, keeping him from having a consistent role in my life)\n- She pushed the hardest for my Asperger\u2019s (now ASD) diagnosis and for me to get an IEP, while also disregarding how it affected me in new ways as I got older and others\u2019 expectations of me evolved\n- Being the more financially stable of my parents, she\u2019s been\u2014and still is\u2014the main provider of anything that costs money (food, clothes, healthcare, cell phone bill, counseling outside of school, etc)\n- When my granddaddy died, he made a trust fund to pay for my college expenses and made her the sole arbiter until 8 years from now. Technically, this is the only way in which I\u2019m not directly dependent on her.\n\nAnyway, now to the current shit. Because I\u2019m failing that one class while already having a low GPA, my mom is absolutely fuming. Granted, I should have put at least a little more effort into studying, gotten tutoring, and even been more diligent about my sleep schedule so as not to oversleep and miss multiple quizzes given out only during 8:35am lab sessions. Furthermore failing another class would make me lose a good chunk of federal and institutional aid money. That being said, as angry as she is, you\u2019d think I was skipping all my classes to smoke pot and working weekends as a prostitute. She\u2019s threatened to pull me out of this school, make me live with her again (with no phone and likely very little internet access), and completely throw off what little of an academic career I\u2019ve developed to go to a community college if I:\n- Drop the class I\u2019m failing so it doesn\u2019t impact my GPA/financial aid, or\n- Keep taking the class but fail (I need to go from near rock bottom to straight A\u2019s in a week to accomplish this)\n\nAs if this weren\u2019t enough, I\u2019ve considered downgrading from a double major in Biology and Psychological Science to just seeking a B.S. in Psych Science, both to lighten my required courseload in the subject I\u2019m struggling in (math), and to focus more on classes that interest me; ideally, my academic performance will improve once I actually like most of the work I\u2019m doing. However, if I were to do this\u2014independent of the current class failure debacle\u2014my mom would probably still try to pull this crap or do something similarly drastic, because she did badly with her B.A. in music and has a grudge against anything even tangientially related to the Humanities.\n\nI feel completely helpless right now. I know what I wanna do with my education, but can\u2019t because of her\u2014and I\u2019d rather be fucking homeless in another country than go live with her for even another month.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

A couple of things that made me go \"Hmmmmm\" today.", "author": "Stabfacenotback", "self_text": "I had a huge to-do list today to get my ducks in a row.  By 2pm, I checked all of them off.  Nothing more for me to do until next week so the process of leaving gets put into action.  I am celebrating a tiny success which promises to be a long journey.  Yay!\n\nHere's the \"couple of things\"...\n\nShort story:  Someone told me his behavior over the weekend when talking about us splitting up that did not match his behavior towards me.  I will describe his behavior towards me that just happened.  And the other thing is, he had told me something about him a long time ago and there is a story about how he completely lied to me about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDetails for those who are interested:\n\nThe last straw for me was a bizarre argument two months ago, that began with my words, \"Why are you being so passive aggressive?\" when we already knew it was over between us and agreed to live like room mates during sorting this out.  I expected something along the lines of \"You didn't do...\" or \"You did...\" as far as being a room mate goes.  What I got was complete bullshit.  The same BS for which we are splitting.  I'm like, \"We already split.  You don't get to have an opinion on anything more personal any more.\"  (It was in regards to when my sister came up to visit and we both invited him to join us for dinner and drinks and he said he'd join us.  Then, he declined at the last minute so we went without him.  My sister and I did what we have done since we were 35 and we are now 50 (ish).  Well before I even met him.  He has zero right to be mad about it.  Nothing \"funky\" happened that night. I just wanted to know if I was being a bad room mate.  The argument escalated and I retreated.  Not scared.  But more like, \"whatever\".  But it was then that I decided that I would not share our bed together (no sex, just sleeping like we had been doing since we split for good).  \n\nWe have been living together but have in separate bed rooms for more than a month since that argument.  While he didn't demand I leave the master suite, he yelled that he would not budge.  I gotta say, I designed and pay for the addition to the house that is what we call a sanctuary.  I consider it mine more that ours.  But Whatever, dude, so I took the guest bedroom.\n\nWe manage to not even see each other at home even when we are both home.  I was lucky to spend the majority of the weekend at home alone and I started de-cluttering my belongings, preparing to list the house and get it show-ready.  I admit, I kind of wondered where he was all day long, but words of wisdom from my sister, \"Why do you care?\" reminded me not to care.\n\nSomeone was telling me that he spent part of the day at the gym to work out where we both work (I didn't work this weekend).  Kinda weird because we have a full gym that only he uses that he uses every single day, in our basement, but fine.  Get out of the house, that's not weird in this situation.  The reason the person was telling me this was because the person was telling me how heart broken my stbx was describing our break up.\n\nHuh.  News to me but doesn't change a damn thing.  I said, \"He's not acting like that to me.  Oh yeah, he's just acting.\"  The person looked at me like I was some cold hearted bitch.  So I said, \"Nevermind.  I've learned not to say too much.  Talk to him all you'd like.  I don't want to make anyone take sides.\" and I walked away.\n\nBut with this in mind, when I got home (and was super glad he wasn't home again), I started making myself some food and I had my air buds in while doing so while talking to my best friend about our alma mater making it into the NCAA sweet 16.  Then he came home.  Stomped in with some groceries, saw me in the kitchen and abruptly left the room.\n\nAt that moment, I accidentally dropped a can of Pringles on the hardwood floor.  You can imagine potato chips shattered everywhere.  So I went to the bathroom to get some wipes to clean up the mess.  When I returned, there he was putting his groceries away, standing on the broken chips.\n\nI said to him, \"Oh no!  I dropped the Pringles and I need to clean that up!  Careful!\"  and he turned around and ignored me.\n\nHmmm.  Oh, he must know I'm on the phone.  Oh look at that, he has his air buds in, too, and on his phone.  He's heartbroken and simply didn't hear me.  Right?  hahaha yeah, right.\n\nSo when he turned around, I waved my hands at him and said, \"I was actually talking to you.  I need to clean up my mess.\" \n\nHe looked at me with disdain and said to me, \"I know.  I heard you the first time.\"  Then he slammed the cabinet and walked into the master suite and slammed the door.\n\nYeah, he's so heart broken.  Nope.  He's just doing the whole \"acting\" thing to other people we both know.  Yikes.  Par for the course with a Narc to make himself look better or get sympathy.  Whatever.\n\n\\-----------------------\n\nI finished my phone call, ate my food, and went to \"my\" bathroom.  I never knew this, but because he's a loud talker, I could hear his conversation while I peed.\n\nSo now I'm at the part about what he told me when we first met.  He had told me that when he was younger, he was a model for men's underwear for print ads.  This was 25 years before I ever met him.  So...circa 1984.  I believed him.  He is handsome and was a competitive body builder.  I never questioned it.  We never talked about it much.  But he did bring it up a few more times to me in the past 10 years.  No big deal.\n\nWell, while I was on the toilet, whomever he was speaking with, IDK, but he was talking about the deal about the underwear model times.  I assume he was talking with his best friend from high school.\n\nBut...this was much different.  He was laughing and joking about how he got scammed.  It was one of those where a \"photographer\" says they're in the ad/modeling industry, they lure unsuspecting people off the street with promises of money to be earned as a model, set up a photo session and then charge a bill with zero work to come out of it.  He kept saying, \"Yeah, like I'm gonna spend $1000 on this!  Yeah a grand!  For that bullshit!  Hahaha!  Remember I kept asking our friend who set me up for this joke?  Yeah, no.  That was real.  I never paid for it.  What a scam!\"\n\nQuite a bit different story than what he led me to believe.\n\n\\----------------------------------------\n\nMoral of the story:  Don't be lured in by the bullshit they fed you in the very beginning.  And don't be lured back by the bullshit they're telling mutual friends.\n\nNarcs are full of shit.  Their entire lives and no amount of loving them can change that.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I \u201cannoyed\u201d him and he preceded to demean me and make me feel like absolute garbage to the point where I was begging and crying for his forgiveness, not even knowing what I did wrong to begin with.

However, it took until this past Friday for me to really wake up and get out of the relationship. Technically, he thinks we're on a month long \"break,\" but I'm viewing this as a break-up. I'm just allowing him to think that so he won't contact me.\n\nEvents over the last week caused his mask to be fully removed, and he became unhinged and obsessive. But, of course, he'd done \"nothing wrong,\" and expected me to take on all the blame. When I didn't grovel and beg for forgiveness as I've always done over the last 3 years, he resorted to disgusting coercive tactics, trying to regain control. We're long distance, so he mentioned how much he's going to miss having sex with me, suggesting I come visit him that day so we could have sex one more time before our \"break.\" After he'd ignored me for 3 days as punishment and told me how horrible I was, how much I hurt him and that I cause all of our issues. As if I'm just a slab of meat he can use and abuse whenever he wants. I was revolted. In the past, I would've ignored my intuition and caused myself more harm by driving to see him. This time, though, I told him it wasn't a good idea, and I made an appointment with my therapist instead. We haven't spoken since. Although last week was scary and broke my heart, it was what I needed to finally realize that this man brings nothing but toxicity, sadness, and disappointment to my life. \n\nI felt strong over the weekend and was happy each hour that went by without hearing from him. However, it's now Monday, and reality is beginning to set in. I still do not want him to contact me, but weekdays are especially difficult given our routine phone calls around 5/5:30pm, and looking forward to hearing from him throughout the week. Although, if I'm being honest, those phone calls and texts were all one-sided anyway; I'd sit on the phone listening to everything that happened with him at work, but once it was my turn to speak, I rarely got any reply from him. He obviously didn't care and I always felt empty. So, I guess  I just miss a bad habit at this point. \n\nAll of this to say, I want to really walk away this time. I know that by leaving, I have the chance for a better, happier future, and there's no chance of that ever happening as long as I remain in this relationship. We broke up about 9 months ago and I felt solid and strong, but sure enough he worked his hoover magic and I got right back on the carousel. This time, I'm grounding myself in my self-worth, my knowledge, and knowing I don't deserve to live like this. Three years was long enough.\n\nIf you read all of this, thanks for listening, I really, REALLY appreciate this community.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

A violent relationship.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSometimes I just can\u2019t wrap my head around her behavior so maybe people here can help me with that.\n\nI understand, that this is gonna be biased since it is only my POV but I have to start somewhere.\n\nAfter thinking about how I could format this, I will just post some **snippets** of the bad parts of our relationship. The good parts are more less absence of bad stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Disclaimer:* After a recent fight she sent me a link to a description of narcissistic disorder to show me how I am. And all I could see was a description of her. So there is definitely a possibility, that we are both narcissists I guess.\n\n&gt;!Snippets!&lt;\n\n* Typical \u201efinal\u201c statements of her include things like \u201eyou are the devil\u201c, \u201eyou\u2019ve ruined my life\u201c, \u201eI will not survive this relationship\u201c, \u201eyou\u2019ve destroyed everything\u201c. Things got more intense since a while back a mutual (f)riend told her, how she doesn\u2019t like the way, my SO treats me in public and is somewhat insulting towards me.\n* When I was 20 I had the opportunity to work in Asia for 6 weeks. She told me that since she couldn\u2019t stand no knowing \u201ewhat happens over there\u201c, she would leave me before the trip. As a reaction I managed to arrange a little side-gig for her there and she went on the work trip together with me.\n* I often feel manipulated to be in a constant state of \u201eyou owe me\u201c - either because I fucked something up, forgot something, did something wrong, etc. - This results in me constantly going beyond my limits of what I think I can do for her and our family. Like physically. Sometimes I am just exhausted but keep on going.\n* Half a year after our son was born I woke up at night with a severe panic attack. She helped me find a psychiatrist the day after. The second day she wanted me to ask him for a support group. Not for me but for her as a relative. I ended up with six months of panic attacks and one year of group therapy. It was a challenging time for her I will not deny this. \n* She is sick quite often. Through a somewhat weird logic she uses this to push things through. An example would be: \u201eI can do that, but that would result in two more days of me being sick.\u201c or \u201eyou can go to see your friends, but I don\u2019t know if I can handle the baby for that day and maybe you have to skip work the next days after that.\u201c or after starting a fight \u201ewell thanks for making me scream again, that will be one more night of coughing!\u201c.\n* When we fight, I usually try to keep my temper. Often enough though she will cover her ears and keep on talking. When I remove her hands from her ears to get through to her, she claims domestic violence. Which is right of course. This leads to the next point though.\n* She is often physically abusive. Pinching, hitting me on the body - not the face though luckily, breaking stuff, once burned a book of me, heavily scratching me, etc. My problem is, that I can\u2019t really do anything about it. I can\u2019t hit her back obviously. \n* Her father once wanted to talk to me about our relationship. He\u2019s a good guy. She told me before the talk, that I should not mention the physical abuse because his heart is weak and he is 80 years old, etc.\n* She asked me several times to set a timer to remind me every ten minutes to pick up sth from the floor. After I was cleaning the house for like 2 days straight. For me this adds to the constant feeling of \u201enot doing enough\u201c.\n* What I tell her often is, that I only learn from her behaviour, that it will never be enough what I do. No matter how hard I work she always treats me, like I give only 20%. I tell her then, that only because SOMETHING is missing, doesn\u2019t mean, I did NOTHING. \n* I am a freelancer and whenever my agent calls I am in huge spontaneous stress, because usually something will be bad about me taking a job. This goes as far as her having lunch with a friend and wanting me to cancel a 700\u20ac/day job so she can go there. She could still go there, but with the kid. Or me having to shift jobs around because she needs a day off after me working for a day. The other day I took a job after six weeks of not working and it led to a complete escalation.\n\nWhen she is sick I cancel jobs, this makes me nervous whenever she gets sick. The last time I (read: my family) lost around 5k over a matter of a few weeks because she was sick. \n\n* She works in the media industry as well, but hardly makes any money off of it. Maybe around 2-3k a year. She still insists, that she does as much financially as I do. \n\nWhen I say, that I do our taxes and know both our numbers, and she hasn\u2019t made in the past four years, what I\u2019ve made in the past year she tells me to jerk off to the numbers or something like that. Although I didn\u2019t bring up this topic in the first place. I was just reacting to her false claim with the reality.\n\n* Often enough, I have the feeling she really pushes me in a direction and once she has me where she wants me (me escalating, shouting, punching the wall or whatever) she will start a kinda diabolic laughter and point at me and tell me how I am no more better than her. Followed by how violent I am and how abusive and what a narcissistic asshole I am.\n* Over the past years she constantly gave me the ever growing feeling of me not being able to leave her since she wouldn\u2019t be able to care for herself and now our kids. The other day I literally dragged from the edge of the window - she was already pregnant. She then layed on the floor crying and sleeping for three hours. She refuses to see a psychiatrist since she\u2019s already done that and it\u2019s my turn now to change things for the better. \n* The other day I wrote our couples therapist an email for a new appointment. I read it to her and we send it together. The same evening a huge fight broke off, because I did it too late and she won\u2019t even go there because I didn\u2019t do it earlier although she reminded me of it.\n* This leads to the last point - I could go on but I guess this is already too much to read anyways. She often tells me and others (she is very open to her friends about how I am a jerk and a good-for-nothing) that her job in this relationship is to delegate things. And how this is so much more exhausting then just doing what others tell you to do. She will tell me to stop thinking and just do what she told me. When done the typical mistake is found and I am treated as if I did nothing at all. Not always of course. But often enough. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;!End of snippets!&lt;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPersonaly I think, that when you are just two people, the one who delegates constantly is just not doing his 50%. I told her that as well. I guess she told me to shut up or something.\n\nI will stop here. \n\nAfter writing all this I am really shaky and it reads like a mess. I don\u2019t think I can leave her. I don\u2019t really know if she will be able to take care of the kids. She already told me that they all would be better of dead. Later claiming this to panic attacks and of course she wouldn\u2019t harm the kids. But already now she won\u2019t stop talking to our 2year old about how unhappy she is, how I am so bad to her, etc. She will do that for 15min. and when I try to stop her it will only get worse so I leave. \n\nI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m really not feeling great right now and don\u2019t know what to do or expect but I have the feeling, that I just can\u2019t keep everything under the rug forever. I have nowhere to vent and not really anyone to talk to. I don\u2019t see my friends very often as stated above. I feel isolated in my situation. Basically the only one that could help me right now is her so I try to play it cool and calm her down whenever I can. I am in a constant mode of \u201eyeah - you\u2019re right - I really fucked that up!\u201c. When she tells me that she doesn\u2019t believe me I sometimes think \u201ehow the fuck could you even possibly think, that I take the blame for this shit?!\u201c but then I say \u201eno really, I was totally out of my mind - you did nothing wrong.\u201c\u2026\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI pasted the post and it feels like a HUGE betrayal towards her. In public I always play it cool and won't say anything bad about her. This right now feels really like I am doing her wrong. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

A. Lot. Saturday I tell him I just want to feel heard, because I often feel dismissed or invalidated when we disagree and it's not fair or respectful to me.

This is my exact point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to this morning. I have celiac's, and have been to doctors and gone through a lot of food allergy &amp; intolerance tests. I said I'm still having some reactions and it's been a bit stressful. He was very quiet. The topic changed, and he was making fun of girls on social media who stick their tongues out in pictures. I said you do that too (he does, a lot, way more than me). He goes \"it's different\". I said it's not, sticking out your tongue is sticking out your tongue. We went back and forth \"no it's not / yes it is\" over and over.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI left the kitchen, thinking this isn't worth an argument.

I said please move, I'm leaving for work. He blocked it again. Told me he wants to be heard. I said you just invalidated my celiacs, and I'm on my way to work, we can talk about this alter, but not right now. Please move. Again, he didn't. He was trapping me in my own home.

All she could say was that i needed to think positive, needed to go out more, etc, yknow, go do some yoga...that kinda thing. Both my sisters said the same thing too. That i needed to try harder in thinking positive. i get what theyre saying, but like ive been trying for years, for so long, and its not working. i dont know what else to do at some points, i just feel miserable, and like i cant do anything. the only thing keeping me going is my friends and my cats. so after that i just felt really awful. the only reason im here today is because i want to spend time with my friends, and iw ant to do things that i want to do.  \n\n\nbut, as much as im trying to be ok, i feel like im slipping, and i just cant be happy. my family ridicules me a lot, i cant be sad or upset, or cry cause theyll just tell me to get over it\", or that i need to stop moping around\". i cant cry in front of them, because im scared theyll be upset with me, so i always end up holding it in or crying when im alone (whenever thats possible). i dont really have much privacy here, and my family doesnt like my friends, and my mom has a curfew limit. everytime i do feel upset they always ask \"did you friends say something?\" nad its like, why is the first thing that comes to mind is my friends? i know we have our ups and downs but at least i can talk to them, and we can come together because we love each other, yknow? i know most of my friends are online, but theyre really precious to me, and we're always there for each other. theyre all i have.  \n\n\ni have one friend clsoe by, but i try not to bother her much because im afriad my mom will cut her off from me. my mom cut off a friend of mine before, for really stupid reasons, she had a friend of her's stalk me on my facebook, and she saw something about me coming out as trans, and my friend was supportive of me, so my moms friend told my mom and she got upset and cut my friend off. she grounded me from being online, and using my laptop mulitple times too, and this was after highschool, when i was 19-21. so i dont talk to nayone much about my friends. i like to call my friends though, and we usually chat and have fun together. i try to do it when no ones home, because they like to eavesdrop on me. One time i was calling my best friend, and i was helping him with his homework, and my sisters eavesdropped on me, and eventually told my mom. so my mom tells me that my best friend is just using me, and that hes not a real friend. My mom always says that about my friends- how theyre not good people, how theyre not my real friends, and that the only friends i have are my family. i even met one ofm y online friends recently, back in november- i only told my family iwas just hanging out with my friend (C), cause we always hangout. so i came home that night,  and my sister (R) asked me how was my day, and i told her that i got to meet one of my online friends who was really nice. she didnt seem bothered by it, and she said thats good. but i guess she told my mom cause the next day my mom interrogates me about it, asking about my friend's gender, and how i shouldnt meet or have online friends, and that i was being 'secretive' cause i didnt tell her about it. i didnt tell my mom cause she wouldve just told me i couldnt go. she always says im being secretive, because i dont talk to her about my personal life. i tried, but everytime theres always something im doing wrong. why would i want to talk to people who never listen and never take me seriously, who always ridicule me, who get angry and upset at me for doing or sayign something?? every thing you say they make it into an argument, and they dont know how to actually talk. that's exhausting. i never talk because of this. im always quiet, but because of that im being secretive'. and its like, no matter what i do its never good enough.  \n\n\ni dont know if i can type up everything, and i left out a lot of things, because there;s honestly so much that has happened. it's just lately ive been feeling realy tired and drained, and im feeling depressed where i cant fully enjoy myself with my friends, ive been crying for the past3  days about it lol....i jsut dont know what to really do at this point. i have plans, like, findign another job or getting more hours, so i can save up and learn how to drive, my friend said shed teach me, and i just want to move out of this place. but sometimes it just feels like ill be forever stuck here, and it really scaresme. it scares me becuse i feel like ill acually commit suicide if i stay any longer here.  \n\n\nim sorry this is so long, and is maybe nonsensical words, but i just wanted to let out my feelings somewhere. i hope...i dont sound crazy. i think my family thinks im crazy, i guess i just want reassurance. but thank you to anyone who spends time reading this. im not doing anything rash i just wnated to talk about it to gather myself and thoughts.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

Anyone who wasn't \"approved\" by him fell out of contact many years ago for reasons you all probably understand already. Anyway, this circle of ours is a creative community in which my Nex has a LOT of social capital. I don't want to give away anything too specific, but suffice it to say he was the kind of person you'd call when you had a proposition or needed to get something done. His work was/is somewhat popular, too, and he has collaborated with almost everybody we are friends with in some way. I wanted to mention this because, well, most of the people I know have personally benefited from being in his good graces. \n\nI'm not sure how clear the abuse was. I always thought we did a good job hiding our \"problems\". Even if he was mad at me while we were out, we would both act like nothing was wrong. He would text me things or berate me quietly if we got a moment alone, but we always seemed good at acting like nothing was wrong. I don't think I seemed like your classic abuse victim, either. I probably didn't appear isolated, considering I knew all these people and was attending events with them all the time. \n\nWith that said, the mask wasn't perfect. I know for a fact that my Nex has lost his temper countless times and a ton of his friends have been the target of his rage. And I know people talk. People *had* to know about his temper, but I never heard a peep about it. There was one incident, too, where he was totally wasted and shoved me at a friend's house. He spent the entire rest of the night spewing pure venom at me and all of our other friends who were around. People were disturbed and somewhat confused but it dropped pretty quickly. Only ONE PERSON who was there said anything to me about it in the days following, and this person was more of an acquaintance than a friend to me. \n\nMany months later, after the breakup, I went out to dinner with a girl friend of mine from this same social circle. We were talking about my ex, and she mentioned something about the night I mentioned above. She had heard about it very soon after from someone who was there. I didn't think much of it at the time, but now it's hard to swallow. She is supposed to be my friend...she knew at the very least that I had been verbally abused by my SO...yet she never saw fit to say anything about it? Not even to ask if I was okay? And since the breakup, a few of my other friends have told me about the misgivings they \"always had\" about my ex. The same people who called us the \"perfect couple\" and ooh'd and aah'd over our relationship while we were together. \n\nI'm sorry this post is getting so long. But I'm reeling. So many examples, so many questions. Did nobody suspect a thing? What did they say about us when we weren't around? Was there just too much to gain from staying on good terms with my ex? \n\nAnd, really, I know it wasn't anyone else's responsibility to \"save\" me from my ex. And I know that people are often more oblivious than we give them credit for. But I want *friends*, not acquaintances. And while nobody's cut me out for leaving my ex, they've made very few efforts to see me outside of the events I no longer attend(too many god awful memories there). There is something about it all that's still making me uneasy and unsure.\n\nDo any of you have experience or insight with this?", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When I emailed her telling her this first she didn't respond for about a week then when I continued to follow up with her she says, \u201coh I've already talked to the vendors, and I notified everyone from my side over a month ago.\u201d This would mean she basically hung up the phone with me and then turned right around and notified all of her guests that the wedding wasn't happening without informing me at all. \n\nNow I have notified my guests, and I am trying to get her to send me back the engagement ring. It was very expensive. She's doing the same thing. Not responding to my emails until I followed up several times. Now she's told me she'll send it but she won't be able to for at least two more weeks because she's too busy. I responded that that was unacceptable and could she please make time to send it sooner. Now she says that she'll try.\n\nIn all of the emails she's still calling me honey (which I\u2019ve never liked being called) and signing them I love you. It\u2019s super weird. I am trying to not rock the boat until I get the ring back. Once that happens I can take care of any other business that remains between us without any action from her. \n\nI don\u2019t now if I\u2019ve explained it well, but her behavior is messing with my head because it\u2019s so far off from what a normal person would do, but it\u2019s not flagrantly bad (rage, smear campaigns, etc.) either. I guess I\u2019m just trying to vent and get some perspective until I can go 100% no contact. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It was two years ago, almost, but I still feel the pangs of this breakup. This is gonna be long and could be even longer if I really went in, but here's the gist:\n\nWe were best friends for over 10 years--I've known her since I was in 4th grade or so. Even then, though I saw something in her that I felt was distorted or didn't quite add up. She always had boyfriends--from the time we were very little--and was boy-obsessed. Her mother always exacerbated the issue through constant reminders of her need to have a boyfriend, or by staying in contact with her boyfriends (going as far back as even my friend's 8th grade boyfriends.)She would change everything about herself, cut her hair, change her interests, take up bass guitar--all to make some guy like her. I remember one time she even tried to perform some kind of love spell on a guy she met at a coffee shop.\n\nShe would always shame me or make me feel bad if any boy was interested in me, saying that it was \"gross.\" She would get mad and possessive if boys we knew didn't like her or want to have sex with her--the guy in high school that I saw off and on was someone she claimed to have on \"the backburner\" and she would shame me if I ever tried to talk to her about him. \n\nWhen I decided to go to the college I go to now, I remember feeling panic because I would have to be friends with her, to live under her shadow as I always feel like I have (not to be melodramatic but like. idk thats how it felt !!) . However, I am a person with intense codependent issues and I fell right into the comfortable and good parts of our relationship, ignoring how she made me feel about myself and her effect on my self-esteem. I even went so far as to LIVE with her! We had really really high highs, where I would cry knowing how much I loved her and she loved me, and really low lows, where she would flirt with my girlfriend and do what she could to belittle me in romantic and social situations. I never felt like I could survive without her. She would give me the silent treatment if I hung out with my girlfriend instead of her, would make me feel bad about my relationship, and would shame me if I ever started to seem closer to someone else.\n\nI finally decided to leave the friendship when I met someone on a long camping trip that I went on that had a similar experience to me with  her ex best friend. She convinced me that I should leave the friendship, that the feelings of shame and inadequacy were not normal, and that I deserved better.\n\nThat was about a year and a half/two years ago, and I still think about her a whole lot. We live in the same city and i see her sometimes, but not that often. When I do I am reminded why I am absolutely not friends with her anymore. I still feel a lot of love for her and think that she is, at her core, a really good person. I just think that she has this void inside of her that she tries to fill with boyfriends and best friends and she;ll do anything to not EVER look into that void. I remember when I was younger saying something like this to my mom--but ignoring my gut feelings about her as a means to perform my \"duty\" as her friend, not wanting to \"abandon her.\" I mainly just feel anxious and panicked if I see her or think about her and I'm in therapy and all that, but I wanted to know what yall think about this/how yall have dealt with leaving and your process of healing after? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My best friend of 10 years is a narcissist.

Why do I feel like it\u2019s my fault?", "author": "Kidarkade", "self_text": "I just came out of a relationship with someone that I had been with for a year. First, I am not inexperienced when it comes to relationships. I\u2019ve been in several long term relationships. I was even married for 10 years and my ex-wife and I remain good friends to this day. In fact I am still friends with almost all of those I have been in a long term relationship with. Most were all very healthy relationships. There were issues of course but none that ever left us never wanting to speak to one another...that is until now.\n\nWhen I first started seeing this person, it was long distance. She lived in CA and I lived in WA. We talked for hours every day. It started off as friends but eventually we jumped into a relationship. After a year and a half and a few visits to one another she moved up here to be with me. That\u2019s when everything started going downhill.\n\nAlmost immediately she was abusive, unstable and I discovered she had a severe drinking and pill problem. It was incredibly stressful. After 6 months she moved out and got her own place in hopes that would help things.\n\nIt just got worse and worse and worse. In fact I don\u2019t think I have ever dealt with this kind of thing before. She punched me in the face twice. She threatened my job, my home, even threatened to call the police and tell them I physically beat her (I recorded this voice conversation for evidentiary reasons since it wasn\u2019t true.).\n\nTo give you an idea of how horrible she was to me, I confided in her once that I was molested by my uncle and my mother when I was a child. During one of my ex\u2019s drunken fits she told me \u201cthe only people that want to fuck you are your mom and your uncle.\u201d\n\nYeah. She said this. I also took screen shots of this conversation.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this because I am a man, who was in an abusive relationship with a woman. I never once treated her poorly in fact I did everything I could to support her. I believed so strongly that if I could inject someone with love, kindness, understanding and patience that they could eventually see what I see in themselves. At this point I knew she had some pretty severe mental challenges and substance abuse issues. I convinced her to be sober and started going to meetings with her. This happened after a major suicide attempt she made where she was hospitalized. Unfortunately the behavior never changed. I\u2019m pretty sure she is borderline.\n\nIt got to a point where I could no longer take anymore. It had already began to affect my self worth. It started to affect my performance at work and I stopped caring for myself.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong though I am by no means a push over or wet rag. I knew what I was doing and I made these decisions consciously. I thought I was doing the right thing by sticking by her side and taking the brunt of whatever she threw at me. I thought I was helping her by being supportive.\n\nI\u2019ve never in my life been in a relationship like this before. I did however grow up in a very abusive household. I had 3 moms and 3 dads (through various divorces and marriages) and almost all of them were abusive, physically, emotionally and sexually. \n\nI left home when I was 15 and built a life for myself. Generally I\u2019m pretty happy with lots of amazing and good hearted friends, fantastic job, home and I don\u2019t have any substance abuse issues. I thank my Grandmother for helping raise me because if it wasn\u2019t for her I don\u2019t know who I would be today.\n\nThis last relationship though did remind me of the relationship I had with my mother who was abusive in a similar way. In fact the two of them (my mother and my ex) shared the same birthday.\n\nIt\u2019s been a little over a week since I ended things for good but why do I feel heartbroken? Why do I feel so sad? I should be angry and resentful and pissed off. I guess I\u2019m sharing this because I don\u2019t really have anyone to talk to. I guess I\u2019m hoping for some resolution and advice on moving on and forward.\n\nThanks for listening.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I'm sorry but I feel so stupid, so confused, and need to give the back story. \n\nN's mom died 2 years ago. Our casual relationship was still in the early stages, so I didn't know that when he's upset, he needs to be alone and my constant \"let me help you\" texts pissed him off to a huge blowup. Then the night before his mom's funeral, I had a crisis with my teenaged daughter and mistakenly went to him for advice/to vent. He blew up, accused me of making his mother's death all about me, etc. I still feel bad about this even though everyone I tell this to has been flabbergasted by HIS response.\n\nAnyway. His dad died late last week. Alzheimers, dementia, nursing home.. He never really talked to me about his dad because Emotions, but I knew it was somewhat expected. So I've been prepping myself for him disappearing, but instead he's been super clingy, actually SWEET to me, appreciative, considerate... Things he has never, not once shown to me in 4 years. \n\nHe's wanted me to come hang out with him every day as he prepped the last few days. Today was the memorial. I didn't want to go because I don't know his family, I knew his ex would be there and she hates me/has slandered me all over town for being a home wrecker (I am not) .  But I was afraid to say no because I didn't want him getting mad that I didn't care, or if I said I wasn't comfortable going, I didn't want him to yell at me again that I was making it all about me. \n\nAnyway he never came out and said as much, but he asked me a million times what my plans were, I could just come by and pay my respects, etc. I kept saying well I'm sure you'll be busy with family, etc, trying to get him to tell me I didn't have to go, but he kept making comments like he wanted me to come. I finally said to him look, I'll do whatever you want me to do, just tell me, and he told me I was an adult and can make my own decisions.\n\nI mentioned her, and that it might be awkward. I was trying to be like, she knew the man for 20 years, I never met him, so I will not go to keep the peace, but he bellowed at me that it isn't about ME and how I feel, and \"don't make this all about you like you did when my mom died\" \n\nwhatever. He kept making comments that led me to believe that it was important to him that I show my face. For what purpose, I don't know because he knew I couldn't stay for the actual service anyway. I was dreading it. This morning he calls me on his way there and said \"so what are you doing? I don't want you to feel like you have to come, I don't want you to be uncomfortable, I don't know what expectations you have because I might not be able to give you a lot of attention, I just want you to do what's comfortable for you\"... I didn't want to go! But he NEVER even acknowledges that I HAVE feelings so for him to say he cared if I was comfortable or not... That was his grief making him human...so if he's so upset he's actually behaving like a normal person with feelings, I don't want to upset him by making the wrong decision! \n\nSo I get there. I scan the room, he's up front talking to family. I scan for his ex, don't see her or the kids, figure it's safe. Go up to him... She's right there. Dyed her hair blonde so I didn't recognize her. She HISSED at me and walked off. I guess she wasn't expecting to see me. He barely acknowledged my presence, didn't even say hi when I said hey. I complimented his shirt because I had helped him pick it out and I washed and ironed it for him, he said \"Thanks. I picked it out myself,\" and that was that. \n\nHe walked away and I'm left there by myself, at a strangers funeral, so I txt my friend like wtf do I do now and I see his ex has brought her freaking posse for her own moral support. They all hate me. So now I'm sure they're discussing me, what I'm doing there (small town, I know all of these women because he and I met at an activity for our kids that they were also involved with, but they are purely team ex-wife, hate him, and hate me).\n\nSo there I am, in a church, texting, he's off schmoozing... I want to leave but I want to at least have a CONVERSATION with him. Linger, waiting for him to finish but he gets a new person to talk to almost like he's intentionally avoiding me. So now I feel like a complete moron, I feel totally awkward, I know his ex and her friends are probably watching everything I do, I have a huge zit on my cheek that no amount of makeup was hiding... I finally go over to him, touch his elbow, say I have to get to work, I'm sorry, he says thanks for coming, and I leave. \n\n10 minutes, I was there. 10 minutes! That includes all my creepy loitering, and MAYBE 30 total seconds of interaction with him. I don't understand what the point of ANY of it was! Someone explain this to me! \n\nLike I guess in my mind the way this played out was I walk in, I wait for him to notice me, I have a couple minutes of conversation with him, we look at the pictures I went with him to print out (he was showing me some of them when we went to have them printed, it was cute, he seemed to enjoy showing them to me, but there were plenty more), I say okay I should get to work, and I leave...Why did he purposely avoid me?! Why did he make it seem like it was so important that I come pay my respects to a man I've never met, to a family I've never been introduced to, but then barely talk to me when I get there? He knew me being in the same room with his ex was going to be stressful for me, she's done a lot to ruin my life in our small town and I'm really self-conscious around her. Was he testing me? Triangulating (but why?)? Just trying to see if he could control me? Did he just want me there because he's grieving and I'm a comfort for him? I don't understand his angle, I feel like a complete moron, I have never felt so awkward in my entire LIFE, and I just don't understand why I drove 40 minutes there and 40 minutes back just to walk into a church, loiter awkwardly, say two words to him, and then leave.

{"post_id": "b5x5p6", "created_utc": 1553643982, "title": "was i molested?", "author": "d3dgirlwalking", "self_text": "hi, everyone. for the past year i have been struggling to understand some things that happened to me. this started in the second half of my senior year, a few months before graduation. i'd just gotten back from dinner with my mom and siblings, and went to the kitchen to get my leftovers. my dad was in there, and we talked for a minute, and then he started making this lewd face at me, and then he smacked my ass. as i was growing up, this was a normal thing that would happen and it was always in a playful way. but this time i knew it was different. so i went into my room and locked the door, started texting a friend to see what he thought was happening. while i was in my room, i could hear him on the couch ( my room is right next to the living room) and it sounded like he was beating off. obviously i didn't go in there to see if that was the case, but that's what it sounded like to me. about three weeks later i started to get sick. the worst sickness i'd ever had in my life. the doctors didn't give me the right medicine and i got much worse, to the point that i couldn't even walk. keep in mind that during this time, my parents were fighting and my dad would sleep on the couch instead of in the bed with his wife. so i was laying in bed really late at night, around 12 in the morning and i saw him come into my room. i asked him what he was doing, and he said something about having to be up early and that the couch wasn't comfortable, he didn't wanna get in his bed, some sort of excuse to crawl into mine. i beat myself up for not leaving the room as soon as he got in my bed, but nothing too bad had happened between us until this point. i figured it was just him being weird, it wasn't the first time he'd gotten into my bed, and the other time he did nothing bad went down. anyways, i was just laying there and hoping that nothing would happen. then i felt him turn in the bed to face my back. and after a few moments i felt a hand on my breast. and he was squeezing it slightly. i was thinking the whole time that he was asleep and it was just an accident. then i felt his hand go down my chest and onto my thigh, and then more squeezing and rubbing. it felt like it was going on for hours. i felt so fucking helpless in the situation. when it eventually stopped, i got out of bed and went to my sister's room. i guess she didn't want me to get her sick, she didn't let me stay in there so i just went to the living room and turned on the tv. i had to go back to the doctor a few days later since my meds were just making me worse. my dad drove me. he kept telling me how i was just faking being sick, and how my mom was making fun of the problems i said i was having. and he acted like he was going to hit me. when we got to the waiting room i pretended i had to go to the bathroom so i could call my mom and tell her what was happening. i really wanted her to come and save me, but she called him cussing him out and he just hung up on her. he then started threatening me again and yelling, and he was hitting at me. all i could do was scoot as far away from him as possible. i was basically pressed up against the wall. as soon as the nurse came into the room, it was like a switch was flipped in his head, he started functioning and acting like a normal human being. and whenever she left the room he'd go psycho on me again. usually he calms down after a while, so by the time we got out of the doctor's office he was okay, and acted like he didn't know why i was scared. i had school the next day. i was taking a dual enrollment class (kind of) so i had three late days a week. this was one of them. he asked if i was going to school and i mockingly said i wasn't sick according to him and that i was going. when he and my siblings left i packed some stuff up and drove to my mom's. she took care of me for a few days until he called me begging me to come back home. at this time she didn't know anything about the sexual situations. after i \"ran away from home\", he chilled out a little bit. but he would still slap my ass, usually if i was wearing some shorts or leggings, one time in front of my friend, until i told him to cut it out. and he agreed and said he was sorry. but then he went and told my grandparents that i told him never to touch me again, out of nowhere, like i just hated him for no reason. they asked me why i would tell him that, and i tried to explain that he was molesting me. and they told me he \"didn't mean it like that\". that fucked me up. here i was, looking for support and answers from my own family and they told me that he DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT. i came out to my mother about it twice. the first time, she misunderstood me. i think she only heard the part where he got into my bed, because she told me it was an easy thing to deal with, and to just \"talk to him\" about it. then i started crying and said that wouldn't help, and she said she would say something herself. after i graduated, he didn't try anything else but i didn't want to take a chance with my sister, or that he might decide to escalate things further. so i arranged to talk to my mom about it again. when i told her he touched me she was like \"what? when he touched you on the behind?\" as if it was nothing and i was overreacting. then i explained the bed incident again and she said she couldn't let that slide. i stayed with her for a month or two, and i felt better for a while but she kind of has some narc tendencies. she's definitely better than my dad but staying with either of them for long amounts of time is stressful. forgive me if this post isn't put together all that well. it isn't the entire story either, just the most important stuff. i probably don't remember every single thing that happened and it's really hard to put in chronological order. thinking about any of it is like reliving it. but i need help, and i need advice. thank you for reading.\n ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

It was over the phone and I broke my printer by kicking my chair into it. I have a problem and I need to fix it before I make further irreparable damage.\n\nMy first girlfriend I was with, I was abusive to the core. We dated for close to two-years. I manipulated her weaknesses against her, made her feel shit because every sign of her being strong made me feel weak. I said nasty shit to her all the time, i.e. if we ever get married I'm going to hang myself within the first month. And we were starry-eyed kids, and she told me she was definitely marrying me - so I took that piece of dream and used it against her. That's just a piece of the plethora of emotionally abusive shit I would do. I'm a self-diagnosed narcissist. If she ever slighted me I would act out, and say the most horrible, unspeakable shit to her. She was vulnerable with me, and I took it and ruined it.\n\nShe started dating online after we broke up, and hooked up with this guy over Skype because she was so lonely. She told me that I ruined her, and from now on she feels she needs to be weak for people so that they'll love her back. Can I fix this?\n\nMy second girlfriend, the one who broke up with me last night. I manipulated her secrets against her so that she would stay with me; she was stronger than the first, and would never put with my shit. But I found a way. (Most of the time the first month or two I would come across as the best possible version of me that I could, then when they open up to me I would consciously collate all their weaknesses so that when they've grown sick of me I would leverage that). And I did exactly everything I could to hurt her. I never physically hurt anyone. But I always had this way of conjuring up the worst, spiteful shit to say and then say it - and it was always like I was unconscious when I said it, and I couldn't believe the words that came out of my own mouth - but I was so desperate and pathetic and willing to bend the other person's arm (figuratively) to get them to feel guilty enough, scared enough, to leave me. I would also threaten suicide which I did try once with a rubber tube and my car.\n\nI want to stop. This can't keep going on; I feel like I need to find something like the solace of my own soul before I be with anyone else. I am 21 years old and I don't want to put anyone through this again. This was very long-winded and rambling but I hope you got the outline of the wretched bastard I am. I write sometimes, which helps. But I'm trying to reach out and see if anyone else understands this... I have such a capacity to be resentful and bitter and manipulative, and yes abusive. I am trying my hardest to transcend this resentment and make sure I am never this person again. Ever. Be as critical as you like, God knows I deserve it. But any words of wisdom will be good too.

You told HER  \u201cI\u2019m just seeing if it will workout with \u2014\u2014-, you know I\u2019d choose you if it doesn\u2019t work out, your perfect\u201d  while you told me \u201cI wish you\u2019d just get pregnant. I want a baby with you.\u201d \u201cI want to move to Washington with you\u201d \u201cI like her, but I love you. It just doesn\u2019t feel the same with her\u201d she told me you loved her. You don\u2019t love anyone but yourself.\n\nYou even lied to HER about how you got your computer!

You hardly ever made more than 40 dollars ever. After selling your computer to \u2014\u2014- and taking 350 of my hard earned money while I was basically paid minimum wage you told HER you got everything all by yourself.

You surround yourself with kind generous people because you, narc, are a taker. You leeeeech off people and suck them dry emotionally, mentally, and financially. I want you to stay as far away from me AND HER as possible. SHE DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE EMOTIONALLY ABUSED BY A MONSTER LIKE YOU.

That\u2019s a big difference. Well why did I send angry texts that\u2019s not nice. Well... \n\n I had sent the angry texts (rather than confronting him in person in front of everyone to be polight)  after he had blantently lied to me about the nature of the relationship he had with a woman who was joining for the weekend. He then spent the entire weekend inviting me to things so he could rub this same woman and their amazing love in my face... this is after telling me the day before they were \u201cnothing.\u201d Imagine how foolish I felt standing there watching them interact like a couple. The day Before she arrived he was asking me why we couldn\u2019t tell people about OUR love and what I thought about dating him. (Technically he didn\u2019t ask me out though, he only asked what I thought about dating him) lmao yea I know.. crazy. \n\n Now he\u2019s telling everyone I was the one who wanted to date and that we never talked about it so it\u2019s my fault for being upset. He can\u2019t read my mind right? Poor guy right?\n\n No. No. I was there! I remember! He had brought up the idea of us dating and then went out of his way to make a big deal about how this other woman was nothing when I hadn\u2019t even asked. Then he proceeded to shove her in my face for the weekend. They were so in love after all. Then he gave me the silent treatment for four months. That was what really killed me. He had told me at least that we were friends. I clung to that desperately as some kind of silver lining. That maybe it was all a misunderstanding and they he would contact me to apologize and explain what happened. He had to explain. You would have to be crazy not to.  Nothing. I waited. Nothing. We had a very high level of contact for over a year. The silence was like a roar. \n\nThis silent treatment was also exactly four months before a trip a group of us were going on where he knew I would have no choice but to interact with him. Tickets already bought, friends going, I didn\u2019t know what NPD really was... I went. \n\nOn day one of the trip after four months of silence, he was offended when I wasn\u2019t excited to see him. He ambushed me with a big hug and I almost fainted. I\u2019ve never had that reaction. I was shaking with rage. I at this point I had done some research but didn\u2019t fully understand. \n\nI Spent the entire trip grey rocking as he bragged about his new love loudly and very obviously watched my face for reactions. I put a lot of effort into showing nothing because I knew at that point that\u2019s what he was going for. When he wasn\u2019t talking about how in love he was with his new woman he was hitting on me aggressively. That\u2019s a mind fuck. I cried myself to sleep every night from the utter exhaustion of holding it together all day as he tried to push my buttons in every different way possible. I went to bed the earliest every day and cried silently as I could hear him staying up late laughing with everyone. Very very loudly. \n\nThen at the end of it all I was the bad guy during the trip for acting like I \u201chated\u201d him. I over heard him talking to my friends about it. \u201cWhy is she acting like she hates me? I don\u2019t get it, I never meant to hurt anyone.\u201d He sounds so reasonable to some one who doesn\u2019t know the story. Of course he didn\u2019t mean to accidentally blantently lie to my face. Poor guy. \n\nThe worst is, I never asked for any of it. He was always the one pushing the romantic side and I was always the one digging my heals in and being cautious. After years of effort he finally got me to believe maybe he cared about me a little and then BAM- silence, cruelty, I caught him glaring at me, yes he eventually made physical threats. Yes I didn\u2019t put it past him at that point not to follow through on those threats. Where was the guy from before that one weekend? How could some one change towards me 180 over night? \n\nI finally understand now why full NC is actually something I had to do for my safety. I couldn\u2019t just block him on social media I needed to block the phone number and cut out any and all friends tied to him. I can\u2019t go on trips he is on or be even at the same events. \n\n\nBut it\u2019s my fault right? Maybe I\u2019m the one with the problems? Hahaha no. I\u2019m fine and You\u2019re NOT crazy. They are. \n\nI think they actually do compare our very mild sometimes overly kind behaviors as us being terrible to them. They may actually think they are the victims. They are not, they are insane.  We are not. They are. You are NOT crazy. \n\nThe further I get from the situation the more I get it. He was SO SO SO crazy. Lies on lies on lies. Making me look like a love sick loser when he was the one who had lead me to believe he loved me. And when I had fears about him he worked to console those fears. Then he made all my fears come true.  But I\u2019m the obsessed one, When he was the one who still couldn\u2019t stop trying to get something from me?  And I\u2019m the mean one when I ignored him trying to upset me? It\u2019s my fault for trying to heal and move on?\n\nNC NC NC. It\u2019s only way to get back at them. Live without them. They are cruel and they love your suffering. Leave now, they are not suitible as friends or lovers or acquaintances or anything once they have made you a target.

It was awful and I ended up mentally ill from the drip fed abuse. I eventually got him to leave by asking a friend to lease him a home. He\u2019s a captain at BA but tight AF ..... so the discounted rent was a bonus. I set up a child support system and he agreed to \u00a3500 a month. I had to find the rest for the rent, food, bills.... I was skint but so happy he was gone! The relief was amazing. My positive vibes ended up getting me a great home based work contract, that paid really well. \n\nI decided after the split I needed to be alone and heal. I\u2019d already been raised by a depressed dad and narcissistic physically abusive mother. I was now a mother myself. Alone and recovering from years of abuse.  I love my son so much though and actually really enjoyed those years alone with him. We even managed to spend a month in the Caribbean touring the islands before he started school. Fantastic memories! \n\nThree years later I met my current man. I really wanted to have the emotional security of a marriage and my own family at this point. I\u2019d met loads of lovely men over the three years but none wanted what I wanted \u2018The Family\u2019 \n\nThe new man did see it as a future plan with the right person and I was so excited! I was 37 and finally felt I\u2019d met someone to have it all with.\n\nI\u2019m 41 in May, the new man never wanted to have more children. He just said that as an idea apparently. I\u2019m so upset about it. I feel misled and really don\u2019t want to have children with someone who doesn\u2019t want them! But I feel robbed and angry that he would tell me he wants all these things and then just announce he never felt \u2018excited\u2019 by the idea.  But he has constantly talked about us getting married for the past 2.5 years....... I say talked...... he\u2019s never proposed! \n\nThe family dream is dead now ... I know that and  as sad as it sounds I feel like I\u2019m mourning the children that will never be born.  I would have loved to have met an amazing man and had that family.    \n\nIve been looking at him sideways for a while now and have considered leaving him, I\u2019m suspicious  he\u2019s a covert narc..... but just when I think he\u2019s a total arse he turns into Mr kind and considerate again! The rollercoaster of emotion  is always running in my life  with him. \n\nThe biggest problem with me though is never forgiving him, for getting into a relationship with me, when he knew he didn\u2019t want the family. When I was 22 I almost married a man, and then three weeks before the wedding he announced we would try for children straight after! I never wanted children (I was young and thought I never did) So I called it all off and split from him, it wasn\u2019t fair on him to be with me. He married someone else 6 months later ....... if I can do that and loved him, why couldn\u2019t this new guy meet me and walk away, knowing I wanted something he couldn\u2019t deliver? I could have met someone else. \n\nI don\u2019t think I will ever forgive him. I\u2019m actually really  angry about it.  \n\nCan you get over something like this in a relationship? Is he a narc? Or just selfish? \n\nI\u2019ve spent three years with him, constantly telling me he\u2019s sorting his shit out. That his temper was from feeling frustrated in life...... I seem to be constantly supporting him, helping him, soothing him.  \n\nIf I drive in the wrong lane, he screams at me, if  park wrong he tells the world I can\u2019t park, if I clean a wine glass wrong..... I can\u2019t clean. I wake up at 7.30am every morning for the school run and work (full time)..... but he tells his friends I lay around In bed all morning.

It's kinda long because i think it all started when i started elementary school so it kinda falls into life story territory. So i'll just write it and if anyone reads it thank you. Also, i'm using a throw away account.\n\nA couple of months before i started elementary school i figured out how to read by myself. This was proven to be a huge mistake afterwards. First of all my native language isn't very hard and i've met tons of people who learned how to read by themselves before school. But when i did it my parents started thinking i was some kind of genius. Also my teacher thought the same when i started school. \n\nI lived in an apartment complex rented to my family by the government. If you worked in a certain department in the government you'd live in this apartment complex and my dad worked there. And my elementary school was in that apartment complex. But the population there was small so most students would be from outside the complex. And outside, it was a ghetto. High rates of poverty and crime. And the students from there were either not very smart or just didn't care and got in all kinds of trouble all the time. So between them, school was pretty easy. Also like i said i'd learned how to read by myself so everyone thought i was a genius. (This was proven wrong later in life when i got to a regular high school with regular people) Also it didn't help that all 3 of my older siblings went to that school and they were very successful there and known by every teacher. And my dad was a very respected man in the community and also known by every teacher. So i was in the spotlight, ALL. THE. TIME.\n\nAnd what did this result in? Getting my ass kicked by the teachers almost every day. Getting beaten up by teachers is pretty common in my country. And most parents, including mine, think that that is the only way to discipline a child, eventhough they never hit me themselves. I don't really know how many times i got beaten up but i think the number is in the thousands. Because of my situation no mistake i made went unnoticed. I would get beaten up for forgetting to bring my notebook while the other kids were lifting up girls' skirts and no one gave a damn. \n\nSo my stupid 7 year old ass just got PISSED. I just rebelled. I would do my homework but not bring it in because i couldn't reward the teacher's behaviour. I couldn't let him think that beating me is gonna work and he's gonna get what he wants. To this day if someone tells me to do something i will not do it even if i wanted to do said thing in the first place and know that it will be good for me. It was like war between me and my teacher. We were both just trying to wear each other down. But this was not a bad man by any means. I always felt that he loved me and was trying to do what's best for me. I never felt like he was trying to hurt me and i saw it in his eyes that he was just as hurt every time he hit me. He was just kind of ignorant and he was told this was the only way to teach a child by the previous generation and he wasn't smart enough to question this. This was my life in elementary school and i passed all classes with straight A's. Like i said it was easy.\n\nThen started middle school and it was some more beating from different teachers. Again, straight A's. Then i got in to high school and it was a lot better. In high school you wouldn't get beaten up unless you did something completely horrible. And there no one knew me so i never got beaten up. But at that point i was really shy and i hated school so i was always sat in the back minding my own businness, usually sleeping through the classes. Other kids would make fun of me sometimes but everyone made fun of everyone back then so i wouldn't call it bullying or anything. My grades took a dive the moment i got there but english was the most important subject in that school and it had a lot of credits and i was always getting A's so it kept my GPA high and i was able to graduate.\n\nThen i went to university. Faculty of fine arts. The first year was really good and i was getting really good grades. Had a couple friends that i loved. It was good. The second year i went to a different country for an exchange program. And that's where shit hit the fan.\n\nI loved the country i was in. I met a lot of amazing people and went to a lot of amazing parties. But i met 2 people who i think ruined my life. Or maybe i'm blaming them for my own fuck ups i don't know.\n\nI met a girl from a different country and fell in love. And she claimed to love me as well. But she had a lot of problems. She would use my insecurities to make me feel bad. She hit me a couple times, i don't mean girly slaps i mean punching me in the face or in the stomach as hard as she could. She would force me to have unprotected sex and then blame me for it. Even claiming that i was trying to get her pregnant so that she has to marry me. Honestly i don't know why i took all of this i usually have no problem standing my ground. But with her i just took it all in. Until she dumped me when she got back to her own country. Funny thing is when we were together she made me promise so many times that i was not going to dump her when she went back home.\n\nThe second person was \"my best friend\". When i met him I loved him. We both loved drinking and talking pessimistic philosophy and we got along really well. But then i realised, this guy drinks. A LOT. He would get blackout drunk every day and force me to do it as well. And he would get really violent when he was drunk. Never got violent with me but i've seen him punch the windows of random cars, turning them into dust. So i put some distance between us. But the last straw was when he locked himself in the toilet with my girlfriend at a party and tried to force her to perform oral sex on him. That night i told him i'm not his friend anymore and to never talk to me again. I wanted to kick his teeth in but i was afraid of getting deported. \n\nHe didn't take it well. But not like you think. He didn't get violent or anything. He was geniunely sad and begged me to take him back. Telling me i was his best friend in the world, promising to change. I said no. I had made up my mind. He started to send me weird stuff on facebook. Like child porn or ISIS beheading videos. (Never felt threatening tho, it felt more like he was saying \"haha isn't this funny?\") Still it was disgusting. So i blocked him. But he started following me around at night. Sometimes he would silently stay back, sometimes he would find the courage to come talk to me and BEG that i take him back. I never did. Again, honestly i have no idea why i didn't call the police. The thought didn't even occur to me at the time.\n\nSo after the first semester they went back to their own countries. Never heard from the guy again. The girl dumped me after \"trying\" to make it work long distance for a couple weeks. The rest is classic depression stuff. Drinking and smoking weed way too much. Isolating myself from society, antidepressants, therapy, trying to kill myself a bunch of times...\n\nToday, almost three years later, i feel a lot better than i did before. I have no urge to hurt myself in any way so don't worry about that please. I have learned my lesson and have to live with permanent, embaressing scars on my wrist to remind me of how stupid that idea is. But i still feel broken beyond repair. Haven't had a relationship or sex after that girl. I'm actually thinking of getting myself chemically castrated and being done with the whole sex thing. Even the idea of sex gives me a lot of anxiety at the moment. My grades took a dive after all of that and my career is at the same point as the time all of that happened. But i try to survive. Sometimes i blame all of these people for my problems. And i really wanna hurt them. But then i realise eventhough they hurt me, i could've been a lot smarter about all of this. And maybe i can start being smart now and put things back on track.\n\nIf you got all the way here, thank you for reading.

I\u2019ve done a lot of recovery since then. He got away with it for so long because he\u2019s an emotional and pretty open person, and regularly painted himself as the victim, while also having other traits that make him seem like a great person. He\u2019s charismatic, people know he\u2019s very politically progressive, and he used the language of social justice against me over the course of our relationship. He\u2019s blocked on everything and I\u2019ve cut off contact. The divorce should be finalized in a few months.\n\nHere\u2019s my problem. I\u2019m angry at the fact that everyone sees him as a sad and broken person. He talks openly about his mental health issues. He\u2019s said in conversations with friends (who told me their side) that he\u2019s toxic and goes on about how terrible a person he is. He\u2019s very good at acting contrite. I know that when I broke up with him, he told one friend very simply that he had \u201cbeen selfish.\u201d I know the ideal is for me not to care what he says or how he presents himself. But I\u2019m still furious with his two-faced nature. I don\u2019t want him to be able to get away with acting as if what happened was anything remotely normal.\n\nI want people to know the worst things he\u2019s said to me. I have audio recording of him trying to justify to me why he should be allowed to emotionally coerce me into sex. He was never repentant for how he treated me all the seven years we were together, despite me consistently speaking up and trying to get him to understand, thinking that he somehow just didn\u2019t get it yet. After I left, he still wasn\u2019t repentant - within three months of me leaving, he said to a friend \u201cWhen [OP] is with someone else and fucking all the time, think of me.\u201d He talked me out of getting a degree in Illustration so that we could get married faster, so he could fuck me sooner. And about six months ago, he was telling women I would have slept with him if he wasn\u2019t fat (a lie that is so completely false it\u2019s enraging to think he somehow believes that after everything that I\u2019ve said to him), and victim-shamed someone in a forum who was asking if they\u2019d been assaulted, by telling them they weren\u2019t clear enough and advising what they could do to be more obvious next time (he was immediately banned from that place). I can\u2019t make him genuinely repent, but I can be open about what he did so that, rightfully, no one trusts him when he acts pitiful and righteous.\n\nThe thing is, I know being public can have unintended consequences, so to me, it\u2019s only worth it if being public, knowing that what he did is common knowledge, will actually emotionally satisfy my anger and this desire for justice. At least partially. I\u2019m concerned that this is a feeling that will fade on its own, or that saying something wouldn\u2019t make a difference. So my question is, if someone has made their abusers actions common knowledge, did it help? Was there something satisfying about it that lasted? Do you actually feel better in the long run knowing that everyone knows? A few of my close friends already know, and I\u2019ve offered the truth privately to a few of his friends, some of whom took me up on it. I\u2019m feeling again like it\u2019s not enough, and I\u2019m not sure if this is a situation where it will never be enough and there\u2019s no point bringing it up, or whether I\u2019m actually on to something I need.", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

Even if its a fun nice thing that you really enjoy?\n\nA tiny bit of backstory. I left my ex commonlaw spouse last year. It was a dangerous relationship for me. There was so much violent stuff and so much other abuse as well.\nI was very controlled. \n\nI do animation digitally and during the 4 and a half years with my ex I was not allowed to work on projects, comissions, drawings, or use social media. It went as far as I was not allowed to optimize settings on my pc or in software. At first he was just controling what I drew and worked on. He would then complain that I was not putting in effort to get a job in my feild. When I did get opportunities I was not allowed to take them. I was working 7 days a week between 3 jobs (tech, retail, nude modeling) for a long time and paying all the bills, as my checks went into his bank account (yes I was dumb). I wasnt allowed to sleep in a bed or to sleep for more than 4 hours a night. I wasn't allowed to watch tv or listen to music. I wasn't allowed to play video games unless they were with him. \nThats just the simple stuff. \n\nOften times at night like 2 or 3 am I would be done my chores and work for the day so I could put time into drawing and I would fall asleep on my keyboard. It didnt matter as it was there or the floor. If I decided to do art on my days off I would get yelled at for hours (sometimes 5 hours plus) and he would try to break my fingers or beat me up.\n\nI go to counciling though no one I have ever talked to has understood what I mean when I say \"I have trouble going on the computer. I can't get myself to do art anymore or even use the computer.\" ( I am okay with my phone, but not my tablet, or my desktop.)\n\nI avoid drawing and animating now. I don't use my computer more than twice a month. I play all my games on console like switch or ps3 though I keep forgetting I can watch tv now. I can do most anything from my smart phone. \n\nA lot of times I just sit quietly while mom is at work because I am afraid to do something wrong. \n\nIts not that I dont want to draw and animate I just can't seem to right now. Its not just a hobby its my line of work so its pretty serious as its something I could be doing to improve my finantial situation and make myself more independent. \n\nI did start painting though its not something I enjoy very much because I dislike touching paint. \n\nI am safe now as I live with my mom and I have a bed and I am allowed to sleep for unlimited amounts of time.

It's always been a rocky relationship and we've broken up several times and got back together.\n\nThe main issue has always been his constant lying and putting me down and that he does not possess a lot of empathy (he said himself \"he doesn't rank very high on empathy\") and usually doesn't really care about any kind of problems I have. So it's usually very hard to talk to him about things because he doesn't hide the fact that he doesn't really feel for me and is normally not really interested in anything that doesn't directly concern him. Btw, I call him \"Narc\" because he said himself that he sees himself as quite narcissistic and arrogant, and from his behavior and lying patterns, the shoe fits. He doesn't have any \"official\" diagnosis though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI always kind of used to forgive him for these things because I thought it's not his fault that he doesn't have that much empathy, and he always came back around and apologized afterwards. So at least on some level, he realized that his behavior sometimes wasn't right. However, when he apologizes, it's usually with a \"sorry\" and nothing else, so i'm never completely sure he actually understands what the problem was. I think he doesn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, a few weeks ago he was on a business trip and while he was gone, I got raped.. I don't want to go into too much detail but I've been completely devastated and broken. I had to go and do a rape kit all alone and pretty much had no one who was there for me at that time. I even considered killing myself the first days after because I felt so dirty and broken. I'm now seeing a trauma therapist, so I'm slowly getting better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, he and I were talking on the phone and messaging while he was on his business trip and I told him what happened and after that, I just didn't hear anything from him anymore, which was not the reaction I expected, even knowing that he doesn't have empathy. I thought maybe he just didn't know what to say or how to comfort me, but he wrote me an hour later and said \"sorry, I fell asleep.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's just something that completely knocked the wind out of my sails. It felt like a slap into my face. I just can't imagine someone I love or at least remotely care for telling me they got raped and a few seconds later I just fall asleep?!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt made me feel even more alone and just plain worthless that he didn't even care something like that happened to me. Since then, we haven't spoken and I don't really see a future with anyone who doesn't care if I get raped or not.. But it's just something that's so hard to grasp..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am not even sure if he was actually sleeping or if he just said it. Is that some kind of narc thing? He often uses the \"sleep\" excuse just for being able to use shitty behavior. For example when we have a date and he just doesn't show up, then he \"fell asleep\" as well. It happens all the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I just needed to put this out there since I haven't actually talked to anyone about this but it's made me so confused..

He told me one morning \"I literally have $5 to my name until Friday.\"  Didn't bother me, I was happy supporting him emotionally, and fiscally for him and I to have fun.\n\nI treated what we had going on as an exclusive relationship-without-being-a-relationship.  Think technically single, but emotionally unavailable.  I trusted and confided in him... which isn't something I do easily.\n\nWe seemed to have a really special connection - we just \u2018got\u2019 each-other.  We shared all the same interests and all the same stuff that we liked.  We had very similar personalities (my friends and people who knew both of us, constantly said we were basically the same person.  There were many, many times where we would be texting each-other or talking together and we would say the exact same thing at the exact same time.  He was like my other half. \n\nOh but we argued... the first giant argument: I asked him what he was doing that evening (I wanted to hang out).. he said \u2018I\u2019m busy\u2019 I was curious because we had been constantly hanging out... so I was like \u201coh ok... doing?\u201d, his answer was \u201cI don\u2019t need to tell you anything\u201d.  I was confused because this is the first time he gave me attitude- and I explained later after I got a bit of courage \u201cNo, if you\u2019re doing something that puts me or my health at risk, you do need to tell me\u201d \u2014 cue GIANT argument.  We made up and things were ok for a while.  I ended up still going along with it - we had a massive fight July 1st after I had seen 2 bottles of lube and 2 condoms (which we hadn't used).  He told me \"I definitely wouldn't ever date you\", \"Just go your way in life and I'll go mine\".  We ended up getting back together again after 3 weeks.   We went back into a weird gray area relationship... which seemed to be progressing to a real relationship.... and then he started acting weird... and he tells me he\u2019s going to start dating again... and then got a new girlfriend a week later.   We ended up talking and getting together again.  Most recently I was given ANOTHER excuse as to why he wouldn\u2019t date me - this time it\u2019s because I\u2019m not a woman of color. We still hung out, and things seemed like they were getting distant - which means he\u2019s off to other women.  I called him on it and him acting weird - to which I got \u2018I\u2019m done\u2019   - \n\nI sent a final text: \n\u2018*What\u2019s sad is that you are the textbook definition of a narcissist... I\u2019m \u2018crazy\u2019, your ex was \u2018crazy\u2019, that girl you dated back when was \u2018crazy\u2019.  Honey, you\u2019re the common denominator- YOU are the problem.  You run the narcissist game: idealize, devalue, discard.  It\u2019s sad - I\u2019m over it.  I regret falling for you, I regret loving you.  Because, facts, I am too good for you, I deserve better (yes, DESERVE), and I am worth more.  Maybe one day you\u2019ll realize that, but it won\u2019t be my problem.*\u2019\n\nI often wonder how long they were talking or how long I was just going to be strung along... I\u2019m still absolutely devastated, I\u2019m still extremely hurt.  I have at least learned now that he is pretty much a textbook narcissist... but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that I still wanted to be his girlfriend... still do.  It hurts so much... I feel empty and alone without him (he really did feel like my other half).  I\u2019m struggling to figure out what (if anything) was real.  It felt real to me... and I feel like I won\u2019t find that feeling / connection again. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I started getting a little too deep into my past at some points, sorry. it's really all over the place.", "author": "ohheyitsbrianna", "self_text": "Hi, I'm a 15 year old girl and I live alone with my mother. I don't know whether to call this emotional abuse or not but I kinda just wanna talk about it because the whole situation has fucked me up mentally for a long time. The relationship my mom and I have has been becoming a little bit rocky the past few years due to multiple mental problems that I've been having along with cutting and suicidal thoughts. I don't think my mom knows how to handle it but the things she says make me feel like complete shit most of the time. I'm constantly stressed because I'm scared that she's just gonna go off on me.\n\n A lot of the time, my mom makes these comments relating to my depression and self harm, such as \"I can't leave you home alone cuz you might kill yourself\" or \"Are you gonna fucking cut yourself again?\". The problem isn't completely with the comments, but she says them in this tone that is very sarcastic and it really fucking hurts. I can't talk to her about it because she continuously pulls the \"give me an example card and when I don't have one, she says that I can't pin something on her and not have an example and makes me feel like I'm in the wrong. I try to talk to her about how I feel and she always thinks there has to be a reason for everything. I can't just feel like shit for a day just because of my depression.\n\n She manipulates me into thinking that I'm always the problem. It's really hard for me to talk about this but I just wanted some peoples opinion on it. I feel the need to punish myself after we fight and she says most of the time that I'm \"playing the victim\". She does the same thing when I try to talk to her about how I feel and how she makes me feel. I'll tell her she hurts me a lot with the things she says and when I can't give an example because of the massive anxiety I get from talking to her, she storms off and just leaves me there or comes back after with something else to make me feel like shit for saying it. I start to punch myself in the face, cut, or choke myself because I've made her feel shitty. She then gets mad at me for hitting myself and says I'm being stupid for doing it. \n\nThe only thing I have that keeps me sane is music and my computer along with the games/things that are on it. She feels that I spend too much time on it and will use it as a threat to get me to do things. \"If you don't do that I'm shutting off the internet for the rest of the week\" or \"If you don't take these supplements I'm taking your computer\". I do most of the chores in the house. It's hard for me to stand for long periods of time. I have this thing with my feet where the blood flow gets fucked and they get really red and itchy.\n\n She said she'd give me space and I only have to do the dishes I make, and that she'll let me get my work done/resume on my own, but she's completely stopped that and now she's let about a week of dishes pile up(which is a lot in my house because she cooks a lot), and now I have to do them all by hand because we don't have a dishwasher. It's not just now that these things have been happening. When I was little, sometimes I'd come home with grades that were lower than a B-, she would get upset with me and say they weren't good enough. \n\nFrom around 2 or 3rd Grade til early 9th grade, I would have panic attacks, afraid my mom was gonna be upset at me for having a bad grade. On top of having major test anxiety, I have a crippling fear of teachers for some reason(I think something happened when I was little, but I can't remember it.) and when around people my own age, I have anxiety attacks because I've had many experiences with them that have really hurt me. I didn't really notice until 6th grade or so but I really didn't have any friends. I thought all my life that \"it's okay they're my friend they just don't want to hang out with me or do things with me\" and, \"it's okay if they make fun of me, we're just playing around.\", but I was always the one being made fun of. I was the only person without a group on the final trip of the year in 8th grade. All of the people that I thought were my friends split off into two groups and left me alone. I was forced into one of the groups. The entire trip I was thinking about all the times where I just hated myself for thinking that I meant anything to them. Even my \\*best friend\\* left me in 9th grade for everyone else. We were best friends until around 7th grade, since she moved to another class and made better friends who she's still with to this day.\n\n My mom just adds on to my stress. I can't even go to school because of my anxiety. She's forcing me to go back in the fall, and I'm getting really stressed about everything. She has an obsession with supplements and believing every facebook article she reads. We don't have a microwave, and I'm not allowed to use tampons because they have chemicals in them. She has a cabinet filled with supplements that has two levels filled with pills. She makes me take some of them, expecting them to do anything for me, but none of them have ever done anything for me. I do this 1-on-1 schooling for a class and have been trying to work on it on my own time, but she constantly pushes me to do it right away and will threaten me if I don't, and she constantly reminds me about it and starts to get angry when it's not done immediatly. Some of the things she's done in the past she has apologized for, but it's hard because me telling her about them brings on a whole new set of problems. \n\nI think my mom might be bipolar, but I can't tell. When she's angry, it's like she could punch a whole through a brick wall. She'll get going and talk for an hour, or when she's really really angry she'll sit there in silence until something, such as the clicking of my mouse that she hates with a passion, gets to her and she makes me turn off the only think keeping me alive right now. I start to cry and she just says I'm addicted and that my computer is why I'm depressed. I'm depressed and anxious all the time because of her. She has no respect for boundaries. She'll come into the bathroom while I'm taking a bath and look me up and down and it makes me extremely uncomfortable when she does it. Even if I try to ask for privacy while I'm changing, she thinks I'm hiding something or she'll say \"are you fucking cutting yourself again?\". She's incredibly stubborn and when I try to tell her I just want space she storms off and gets all pissed off at me just for wanting some privacy for when I'm changing. \n\nI know my mom's going through shit too, but it's hard for me to live in this house when she forces me to hug her all the time, even thought she knows I get so fucking tense and anxious when she does. She'll complain how \"we don't hug/touch anymore\", but then she'll force it on me and it makes me not want to hug her even more because it just builds up my anxiety. \n\nI don't understand what all of this is and am thinking of moving out in October (when I turn 16) so that I can finally be happy and be able to have the things I need and the privacy I so desperatly want. She always compliments my body, but on the other hand she'll point out how I'm getting too skinny, or that I look really pale today. I get really really cold when I'm stressed and she always wonders why I'm cold, and blames it on me sitting on the couch all day. The stress she causes me makes me feel like I've been standing naked in the dead of winter for 48hrs.\n\n I just want some help with all this because I don't know what's wrong with me and why she makes me feel like I'm wrong all the time. It just hurts and I want to get out of here. I just put on a smile for her most of the time so she doesn't say that I need to go to the hospital and be put in the psych ward for a couple days. She thinks that then maybe they'll do something with me to fix me. I think I'm done typing for now because I can't force out anything else. It just hurts too much to keep going.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

That\u2019s how they operate, by keeping us in a constant state of conflict, confusion, control and self doubt. It works, it\u2019s worked on me for 18+ years of marriage. \n\nSeveral months ago something changed, I don\u2019t know what it was or why but it did and I\u2019m so grateful. I started paying attention, questioning myself and him, enforcing boundaries and needs I never had before.  It didn\u2019t go over well and I backed off, I noticed how quickly his mood shifted when I went back to being a \u2018yes man\u2019 and feeding his ego. But I couldn\u2019t remain that person anymore, something had awoken in me I couldn\u2019t put back to sleep. I tried and tried to appeal to the guy I married, the guy before all the lies and affairs and rage but he\u2019s not here, I suppose he never was. \n\nHe raged on my oldest son a couple weeks ago and that was that for me. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done it, far from it. He\u2019s made it a habit of addressing every issue with a screaming fit that leaves the recipient feeling terrible about themselves but of course that\u2019s his intent, not a solution to the problem.  I told him that I would no longer tolerate that behavior towards the kids or myself. We\u2019ve all been subjected to his outbursts and I\u2019m done with it, nobody deserves to be treated that way and how would he like me doing the same to him every time he doesn\u2019t do something I\u2019ve asked, which is a regular occurrence?  He moped around the house for 2 days throwing himself a pity party because I dared call him out. Poor thing. \n\nIt\u2019s been all out war since. Covert narcissistic war. Little jabs about a dozen times a day, crude remarks, showing me jokes you shouldn\u2019t find funny and definitely not share with your wife, not picking every single thing.  We\u2019re leaving town today because I have a noninvasive medical procedure, back in 4 days. I\u2019m not looking forward to being stuck in such close proximity for that long. I asked him this morning if we could remain civil while we\u2019re gone, he asked what I was talking about like he had no clue he\u2019s been stabbing me every chance he can create. I said there\u2019s is thick tension between us and I\u2019d appreciate civility. We\u2019ll be with another couple who he admires immensely (the male) and maybe that\u2019ll help him hold it together but I\u2019m anticipating our alone time will be brutal. Even my asking for civility was probably a bad idea. \n\nI called him out on how overly affectionate and touchy he is with women. After your spouse has had multiple affairs, hanging on women is just not acceptable, I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re attractive or not. Hanging on the opposite sex isn\u2019t acceptable period imho.  That was also probably a mistake. We haven\u2019t been out together since I mentioned that but it will be interesting to see what happens when we are. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m so thankful I\u2019m not in the FOG anymore but I\u2019m not sure how to function right now without making it worse. I can\u2019t just leave, I know there will be many suggestions to do so. I am working on a plan to, it\u2019s just going to take some time. \n\nI\u2019m reading Psychopath Free and Radical Acceptance. What helped me open my eyes to the abuse was Why Does He Do That.

He said that it wasn't a big deal, it was just a social media post and that he was just trying to affirm her as a friend because she struggles with low self-esteem. He ultimately apologized after I broke down crying and eventually ended up taking down the post. However, he continued to reiterate that my getting upset over social media post was just me being a millenial.\n\nWe continued keeping in touch everyday through phone, video chat, FB messenger, and text. We both acknowledged that the distance would make a relationship unsustainable since neither one of us was set on moving from our respective locations. I started to grow weary of what had become a situationship.  It seemed like he was enjoying all the benefits of me playing the role of a girlfriend (money, sex, attention) without the responsibility of a commitment. On multiple occasions, I tried to end things with him, saying that I didn't feel comfortable with the lack of boundaries. He would express disappointment, agree to give me space, but then would proceed to flirt with me or try to express how much he missed me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings started to unravel when I called him out about his constant flirting with other women online. I pointed out that he seemed to have no problem flirting with other women when he knew that I could see it, but would get upset at me for doing something similar. I also pointed out his past womanizing behaviors, pointing out that his having several children with multiple women seemed to be evidence of a much bigger problem. This sent him into a rage in which he told me he was single, thus could do what he wanted, and to never in my life use his children to make a point.  After that, I went NC for two weeks before he tried to hoover me through a mutual friend. I told him that I still needed space to grieve and we agreed that we'd slowly work toward establishing a platonic friendship. I actually started to feel hopeful that he understood where I was coming from and would respect my boundaries. That didn't last long.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAbout ten days later,  in a group chat we were both a part of, he shared a picture of another person in the group chat, stating that she was in town. He proceeded to give a play-by-play of their date and even went on to share a pic of her giving him a BJ. I lost it.  After confronting him in a private conversation, he kept stating that we agreed to end our romantic connection and he was able to do as he wanted. I poured out all my feelings of anger, betrayal, and frustration. I called him out on what seemed like a cruel attempt to get back at me for ending things with him. He again apologized, but I told him I no longer wanted him in my life. There will be no friendship. I left the group chat and blocked him on every channel. I've also since deactivated by FB completely because it reminds me too much of him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't until a few days ago that I realized that what I went through was narcissistic abuse.  I feel exhausted and confused. And I can't even recall the memory of he and I having sex. It's too painful.  I'm both angry at myself and angry at him because I wasted a a year of my time on someone that wasn't real. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm really happy to be here for support and to start trusting myself again.

There were no red flags at first. Then 2 months in I had a pretty horrific miscarriage. He was 40 and without children but always wanted them. He got super drunk and that night was the first night he ever hit me.\n\nBecause I know people have a hard time dealing with miscarriage, I considered that night a one off. I forgave him. I later learned that my forgiving him for that night was his justification that he could continue to behave like that and would be forgiven. \n\nAt first the abuse was more mental than physical. I'd catch him going through my phone \"Whose this, whose that, did you ever sleep with him?\". I told him I'd only been with 13 people and he demanded to know all their names. He was very intimidating and though I had been with more than 13, I did give some real names. He harassed every single one of them through Facebook \"to make sure they'd never want me back\". \n\nHe began to do this with my friends. Getting on my Facebook and messaging them horrible things. It ended a lot of friendships. Isolation is what he wanted. Then he somehow conned my mom into loaning him $10k, which he immediately gambled. Mom demanded me to pay back and I couldn't. Destroyed my relationship with my entire family over that.\n\nNow I had no friends and no family. No one to run to or save me. It's just what he wanted. That is when the physical abuse began. Extreme jealousy. I wasn't allowed to make eye contact with any man. He made me look down at the floor while we were in public. He made me switch my many doctors to all female drs. He put a spy program on my phone that recorded everything. Phonecalls, texts, Facebook messages. He could even turn on the mic and camera from his computer and used that to spy on me the very few times we were apart. \n\nHe justified the abuse. He knew my first husband was abusive and after abusing me he'd say \"stop acting like it's that bad, your first husband did you worse.\" \n\nHe didn't start hitting my face until close to when I left, we'd been together about 8 months by then. Didn't want the abuse obvious. It was pushing me to the ground getting on top of me and spitting in my eyes. It was punching my ribs and choking me.\n\nNex made it to where I had nowhere to go. No friend or family would take me. He blackmailed me with nude photos I had sent to a long distance bf because he found them in my fb messages. He blackmailed me with threatening to reveal to everyone that I had a DUI arrest. He blackmailed me that he'd stop paying said DUI fine and send me to jail. He had total control in the end. Even contol over what i ate, I had to go everywhere with him, except the bar, where I suspect he cheated on me with his ex while 'at the bar'. He even controlled what movies I could watch and even bathroom usage. I once mentioned that Ryan Reynolds was cute and from then on he'd never let me watch a Ryan Reynolds movie. \n\nTowards the end he started hitting my face because I never left the house anymore so didn't worry about who would see the marks. He wanted to move to a trailer in the middle of the woods, miles away from town. I know now that he wanted me isolated in the woods in a trailer so that he could do whatever he wanted to me and I would have nowhere to run to because we were living in town at the time and several times I had ran to neighbors when he would hit me. He did get arrested once for hitting me but that was just one time out of probably a hundred.\n\nI stayed out of fear, blackmail, and that i had nowhere to go. No money no job no car. He'd sold my car and said he didn't trust that I'd stay faithful if I had a job. \n\nIt ended with him almost killing me. He came in drunk at 4 a.m., and he said \"there's someone that wants to meet you\". It was his ex-girlfriend, the woman I suspected he had been cheating on me with at the bar. She came in and started yelling in my face trying to get me to hit her but I didn't. She held my arms down while he wailed on me. Hitting me in the face, he body slammed me to the floor and smashed my head on the floor over and over. He kneed me in the ribs so hard that he broke two of them. I screamed and I guess that's what alerted the police, when they got there they took me to the DV shelter. My friend from high school that I hadn't spoken with in 10 years agreed to take me in and that is how i got out. \n\n\nWhen I realized he could have and possibly would have killed me that last night if the cops hadn't showed up, I realized the blackmail meant nothing. It had no power over me any more because it was not worth my life.\n\nI feel it's important that I shared with you Nex's achievement of full control over me. It happened little by little. I'm hoping that by sharing the order in which things happened maybe these abusers have the same pattern and you can recognize this with your narc before it's too late. Oh and nex also had a history of domestic violence but convinced me the girls were the crazy ones and he only got charged because he was a man and no one believes men are victims.\n\nSorry for such a long post but I've never really told my story except to the shelter. I'm hoping that anyone else that is reading this that thinks they're with a potentially abusive narc might see some of these signs and see it in themselves and their relationship and maybe they can get out in time.

We know we are being subjected to a great deal of pain, we even know we are in danger. Yet the trauma-bonding keeps us there. Stuck in that toxic environment. They hold our emotions captive. They hold our basic human rights captive and grant us them in small amounts only to further confuse, control and manipulate us. They isolate us from the outside world, people who care about us - they isolate us from reality. Even if we are able to physically go places, we are still being held captive. We are still being manipulated and coerced into doing things we normally would oppose to. We are still feeling like our freedom has been ripped from underneath us. We stay out of the loyalty we believe we must upkeep, despite it never being returned. We stay out of fear, guilt, shame and confusion. We say that we \u2018stay\u2019, but I think of it more as we are \u2018kept\u2019. After all, if they want to discard you they will. It\u2019s only through a combination of many things such as; great pain, knowledge, encouragement and support that we can sometimes free ourselves from these chains before being released from them. The best combination to do that isn\u2019t so easy to list out. It\u2019s something that\u2019s subjective to that individuals own personal experience. We are brainwashed through various callous and cold techniques, such as intermittent reinforcement and gaslighting. Our whole psyche undergoes changes in perception and we develop an addiction to the unpredictability of the abuse-love cycle. Our inner-voice is drowned out and replaced with theirs. We are their pet. Their property. Theirs to do with as they please.\n\nThis to me - is captivity. And captivity is not just being psychically held captive. It\u2019s not just being trapped in an abusive relationship and then leaving and finding freedom again. It\u2019s a state of mind, a state of being you will carry with you long after the relationship is over. It is something you will have to overcome even after the heartbreak has healed. You will have to learn to re-integrate with people and society again and in a healthy manner, and not naturally resign to shutting yourself off from the world. You will have to learn to rebuild the relationship with your inner-voice and intuition. You will have to learn to re-trust your own thoughts and feelings. You will have to learn all over again, everything you thought you knew about human nature. You will have to reestablish your own identity again and remember what it feels like to belong only to yourself. You quite literally have to re-start your life. \n\nWhilst doing this, we have to keep in mind to not continue the work of the abuser. To not abuse ourselves, because of the lies they have fed us. To not kick ourselves for every mishap, because they have falsely taught us that we are incapable of getting anything right. To not scold ourselves for feeling and expressing emotions, because they told us ours didn\u2019t matter. To not self-sabotage, because they made us feel we aren\u2019t worthy of happiness or success. To still believe in ourselves, despite them telling us we were never enough. To still love, despite them twisting our notion of it. To still live life, despite their attempts to make a misery of it. We have to break that state of captivity. \n\nWe must continue to work on ourselves. Find what encourages us and gives us strength. Self-awareness is key to uncovering the devils work and rebuilding our foundations. A memory will always remain of the depth of pain felt and the exposure to such evil. But they will become more and more distant as we redevelop and define once again, Who We Are. And Who We Are, is for us to decide and not the abusers!   \n\nAnd it is important to know, that we cannot heal in the same place we got sick. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Copied the text from the link and placed it below since I received so many messages of people who read it and found it helpful!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nThe Aftermath of Loving a Narcissist \n\nOur game is over. We can keep fighting and cuddling and crying and shanking each other in the most intimate wounds we shared when trust was the drug we shot each other up with but I have no trust left to give you. I don\u2019t know who broke you so badly that you aren\u2019t able to feel consistently happy with anyone, namely yourself, before the wolf-child inside you needs to tear them apart, feast on the juicy vulnerabilities they entrusted to you, spread their entrails around town and then blame them for the carnal mess left behind. Yet despite the blood dripping down your face, your charming mask remains perfectly in place, a lifetime of practice no doubt, and sadly, I know other women are destined to ignore the bloody warnings and suffer the same fate. I know I certainly waved away the women who were kind enough to warn me to run, not walk, away from you.\n\nNaively, I\u2019d hoped that, with enough effort and honest communication, one day things would change. That if I was good enough, supportive enough, cut ties with the friends you despised (one being my business partner of several years), if I was just creative enough, pretty enough, successful enough, sexy enough, the PLUR acronym or LOVE HARDER phrase you throw around so opportunistically as part of your personal brand would actually emerge from its hiding place inside all your anger and the love would shine its light onto the world. But it won\u2019t. They\u2019re just slogans -overused philosophies you spout for personal gain but couldn\u2019t be further from embodying. The light you take such public pride in shining is merely another avenue used to strengthen your ego and gain more of the power you chase. Once I\u2019d mastered one of the qualities you\u2019d told me so many times I lacked, the rules to your game changed. There was suddenly something new that was disappointing you\u2026a relationship forever off balance\u2026impossible to ever measure up or find stable ground. You\u2019re addicted to the feeling of being in control, luring someone in, parading them around for your image, devouring them whole and then eventually spitting them out\u2026a cruel punishment you convince yourself they deserve for being weak enough to love you.\n\nAnd should any of these women have enough self esteem after months of subtle abuse to still have their own opinions, question your actions and enough energy to express themselves and their needs (I did for a long time), hell hath no fury. It\u2019s easier to sit in silence and take the unwarranted rage in private, rather than publicly anger the beast and face such cruel, petty, vengeful retaliation that it will turn every belief she\u2019s held about humanity and kindness and intimacy on its head. Smear campaigns based on the the most sweetly, intimate secrets she\u2019s entrusted to you are in no way off limits\u200a\u2014\u200adistorted versions weaponized and laughed about with your friends and family for maxium discrediting and humiliation, over-the-top character assassinations, screaming obscenities in rooms full of people, lies and exaggerations told to turn her closest friends against her and public shunning are a preferred form of torture and eventually she will face them all. Then, once she\u2019s suffered enough, you will come back as though nothing\u2019s happened with nonsensical text messages like \u201cI still can\u2019t find the salad spinner. Come over?\u201d or \u201cBabbbbbbby\u2026wanna rave?\u201d She\u2019ll be too raw and exhausted to start the pain over again by bringing up the fight and so relieved the punishment is over, that it\u2019s swept under the rug\u2026until the next time.\n\nOhhhhhh, but should she react, should she remain rightfully angry and hurt, should she attempt to discuss her feelings, she will be called \u201ccrazy, emotional, over-reactive,\u201d and have her valid pain minimized and talked-over until it\u2019s pointless to even try. Should your cruelty break her completely and she screams or cries or yells back in your face out of sheer frustration and self preservation, suddenly that is all that will be discussed. Her behavior. Never yours. A talking point you will repeatedly use against her in all future fights. And even then her reaction will be twisted and exaggerated to the point that you now claim victim status and she ends up apologizing to you.\n\n(Once this began happening to me on a regular basis, I lost so much of myself I eventually stopped fighting back as the only way I was able to to find relief. I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that but I want anyone else caught up in this hell to know they\u2019re not alone. If you\u2019re in a relationship with a narcissist you\u2019ll likely find my story eeirely similar to yours. Narcissists are pathological \u2014once you learn the games they play, they\u2019re entirely predictable \u2013you could set a watch by their behaviors.\n\nNarcissistic abuse doesn\u2019t happen suddenly, it\u2019s insidious, creeping in slowly, until one day you don\u2019t recognize yourself. It is the epitomy of domestic violence, a slowly dehumanizing and purposeful soul rape.\n\nNarcissists install a mental filter in our head, managing our expectations down a little bit at a time. Before we know it, everything we do, say, or think, goes through this filter. \u201cWill he get upset if I do/say/think this? Will he approve/disapprove? Will he feel hurt by this?\u201d Our own wants and desires are brushed aside so often that eventually we are conditioned not to have them. Expressing our needs only leads to pain.\nRecovering from this abuse is heinous, non-linear and at times, feels never-ending. I am a year into healing and it\u2019s still inching along.)\n\nI loved who you were when you were kind. I loved who you could be. But I\u2019ve come to realize that I don\u2019t know who you are. Maybe I never did. I wish this could mean as little to me as it does you. I wish I understood why. I wish this made sense. I wish I could shut it off. I\u2019ve wished that for years. I wish I could brush the rubble of this relationship off my shoulders and keep dancing. I haven\u2019t masted that grace, though I keep trying. No matter how many months I\u2019ve ignored your incessant texts and emails and heartfelt apologies and all too recent declarations of love, some nights are raw and the words get in. Truthfully, at times I yearned to hear them. I\u2019ve fallen back into your promises, your grandiose cosmic epiphanies of love and tearful, aplogetic remorse time and time and time and then embarrassingly, shamefully, time again. To the point I agreed to marry you, though I knew it would end in heartbreak. That\u2019s how badly I wanted to believe you. I\u2019ve questioned my sanity, my desperation to be loved, to be known, to have a partner, to prove to you that I am not the dark, evil person, the \u201cworthless, piece of shit,\u201d you\u2019ve told me for years, along with anyone who still believes you, that I am.\n\nMy head was spun so sideways from living in fear of your next rage or sudden disappearance\u2013the lighting bolt switching from devoted love to intense, vindictive disgust for seemingly no reason (yet, always told it was something my behavior initiated) and having to constantly walk on eggshells, at times I was too exhausted to get out of bed. I was too overwhelmed to leave my apartment. I jumped at loud noises. I developed a painful bacterial infection. I saw a PTSD counselor. During the worst of it, my sense of self was so non-existent, I felt there was nothing left to live for. It was during the times when I was the most vulnerable that you\u2019d come in for the kill\u2026disappearing for days or weeks but not before making sure to let me know that I deserved all of it. Thank God for my friends.\n\nWhat I\u2019m finally learning is that I don\u2019t owe you anything. What I do have to learn is to give myself the love I swam so hard upstream to win from someone who doesn\u2019t have it to give. It\u2019s a battle I am fighting everyday.\n\nStill, inexplicably, I don\u2019t wish pain onto you. The love I felt I can\u2019t just shut off cruelly, the way you have done so easily time and time again. Part of me still feels deeply for the sad little boy inside you\u2013the one who throws tantrums and hurts people before they can hurt him. But there\u2019s nothing anyone can do to help that little boy and I can\u2019t hold him close anymore.\n\nI don\u2019t want to play your game any longer. I don\u2019t believe the tearful stories you tell of remorse and self-reflection when the only changes are the gray in your hair and the months on the calendar. Freedom begins with me facing reality, accepting my responsibility, admitting the truth of who you\u2019ve been to me and letting you go.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nHelpful Articles:\nWhat to Expect When You Live with a Narcissist\nBy Sharie Stines, Psy.D\n\nWhile you may not be physically hit or physically abused in this relationship, your heart will be broken 10,000 times. Even if you think you are a \u201cstrong\u201d person and can handle it; your strength is not really strength, but rather, denial. The following list is not exhaustive, but it is informative:\n\nHe will always define the terms.\n\nYou will live by a set of double standards.\n\nYou will not be truly listened to.\n\nHe will never resolve a conflict, as a result, they will continue to repeat.\n\nHe will rarely consider your feelings; and will only do so if it serves him some how.\n\nHe will never apologize in an authentic way that acknowledges his behavior or your suffering.\n\nWhat will matter most to him is how he appears to others.\n\nHe will ruin all of your birthdays and holidays (unless he can somehow make it about him, i.e., HIS favorite band will play at your birthday party, a trip planned \u201cwith/for\u201d you will be to a location that HE wants/needs to visit, etc\u2026.).\n\nHe will be sullen during (or cause a fight before) events that are important to you because they are not about him.\n\nHe will NOT show up for you at times when you need a partner the most and will be rageful if you are upset about it. (The more distressed you are the more delight in abandoning you).\n\nHe will demand forgiveness for his bad behavior yet do nothing to earn back your trust or change his behavior.\n\nYour expectations will be managed down to mere crumbs; to the point where you will be happy just because he isn\u2019t giving you the silent treatment, yelling at you, or cheating on you.\n\nYou will never win.\n\nHe will be dismissive and, at times, cruel to your pets.\n\nBeyond the initial stages of dating, he will make NO effort to befriend your friends or family unless knowing them benefits him in some way.\n\nYour value will be diminished to the point of nothingness in his eyes. In fact, mere strangers will hold more weight in his eyes than you will.\n\nHe will tend to make you his scapegoat.\n\nHe will dump his shame and rage on to you.\n\nSimple conversations will become crazy-making endeavors.\n\nYou will find yourself walking on eggshells.\n\nYou will lose yourself because you will be trained to focus only on his feelings and reactions; never mind yours.\n\nYou will experience the silent treatment.\n\nYou will experience cognitive dissonance, confabulation, and gas lighting.\n\nYou will find yourself telling a grown adult how to have normal interactions with others.\n\nYour relationship will revolve on a cycle: waiting\u200a\u2014\u200ahoping\u200a\u2014\u200ahurting\u200a\u2014\u200abeing angry\u200a\u2014\u200abeing punished\u200a\u2014\u200aforgiving\u200a\u2014\u200aforgetting\u200a\u2014\u200aagain.\n\nHe will isolate you from your friends, family or financial support and then blame you for depending on him.\n\nHe will say cruel and judgemental things about the friends closest to him while being nice to their faces.\n\nHe will blame you for all of the problems in the relationship.\n\nYou will blame yourself.\n\nHe will use your weaknesses, traumas and intimate secrets against you.\n\nYou will experience many dramatic exits, followed by a reappearance of the N acting as if nothing unusual had ever happened.\n\nHe will act like Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde.\n\nHe will not do his fair share of household responsibilities and will criticize your efforts.\n\nHe will come and go as he pleases.\n\nWhen you try to hold him accountable he will fly into a rage.\n\nHe will not answer questions directly.\n\nHe will never ask you about your day and wish you to \u201chave a good day.\u201d He will never show genuine concern for things that you care about (unless it\u2019s something he cares about.)\n\nYou will feel stuck and unable to leave him.\n\nYou will miss him and wait for him all the time.\n\nHe will project his bad behaviors onto you and you will project your good intentions onto him\u200a\u2014\u200aneither is accurate.\n\nWhen you finally break because of his crazy making behaviors and the insanity of the relationship, he will call you a lunatic, others will think you are a lunatic, and you, yourself, will believe that you are just as bad as him (realize, there is no moral equivalence between expressing frustration and intentional abuse.)\n\nNo one else will see it. This will cause you to\nquestion your reality.\n\nThe entire experience will result in trauma for you because it is interpersonal violence.\n\nHe will compare you unfavorably to other women, especially his ex.\n\nYou will begin to feel crazy; then, over time, you will begin to feel numb.\n\nIf you go to couples counseling it will not work, and will most likely back fire on you. (Please realize you do not have a marriage problem, your partner has a mental illness.)\n\nHe will triangulate you with the other women in his life, causing tension and drama between them and you, while he remains unscathed.\n\nOnce you start to wise up and pull away he will begin to smear your character behind your back in an attempt to turn people against you. In fact, he was probably doing this throughout your entire relationship.\n\nThe negativity and cruelty with which he speaks about his former relationships will befall you as well should you find the strength to leave him. Brace yourself.\n\nMost people will never fully believe your account of the relationship and the psychological trauma can take years to understand and recover from.\n\nNo human being is a match for these tactics, and if you do try to match the narcissist\u2019s game with any of the narcissit\u2019s tactics\u200a\u2014\u200athe narcissist immediately pounces on your lack of integrity, which throws you into the despair: The narcissist doesn\u2019t believe I am a decent person (this destroys your soul and mission to \u2018change\u2019 the narcissist \u2026) or you will feel the incensed mind-bending rage of: Who are you to accuse me of lack of integrity?\n\nWhichever way it goes, you end up battered and distraught, and the narcissist obtained narcissistic supply and the omniponent knowing that he or she can have this effect on you\u2026\nYou can\u2019t shrug off allegations like the narcissist can. The narcissist, once securing you in their life, actually doesn\u2019t care whether or not you think the narcissist is a good person. The narcissist is simply in the game for the two reasons that narcissists interact with anyone:\n\n1) To secure narcissistic supply, and\n\n2) Having a person to hurt in order to offload their tormented inner self.\n\nYou have to accept that the narcissist simply does not hold or even care about the model of love and relationships that you do. His or her values, needs and neuron brain pathways are miles apart from yours. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I was sitting there, begging him to understand that based on everything I have learned and believed up to this point, that steak is not vegan. And he would keep saying it. \n\n(Real life example - him telling me that he wanted nothing to do with a certain girl, that she meant nothing, then proceeding to reconnect with her months later, when we were bad. And proceeding to refuse to stop engaging with her despite not caring. And coming up either ridiculous or no reason as to why.)\n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t accept it. \n\nAnd this forum, has helped me see that these guys aren\u2019t wired like us. This forum has been so eye opening. Moral compasses are different. \n\nUltimately, *we cannot* understand people that will lie and cheat and hurt intentionally. Of course we can\u2019t. It\u2019s not in our nature. \n\nAnd then today, it clicked. I may be far off the mark but it clicked. \n\nThe reason I didn\u2019t accept his answers is because I couldn\u2019t understand them. They made no sense to me because they were *non sensical* and hurtful behaviours that did not add up in my world. My world of not hurting others. My world of trying to do the right thing based on what I have learned and observed. \n\nSo of course there was friction. \nOf course I didn\u2019t accept it. \n\nAnd I really felt awful about this for MONTHS. Because he would give me these answers, and I\u2019d just keep challenging them. I *couldnt* accept it. Then again, I couldn\u2019t walk away. I kept trying, in vain, to discuss. \n\nBecause I wanted, deep down, to believe that we were on the same level. That maybe if I kept on and on and on he\u2019d *get it*. \n\nBut he never did. He never would. What benefit would he get from seeing his behaviours and lies as what they were? Better to stay in his twisted reality. \n\nI wanted validation. \nHe would never give it to me. How could he?\nI should\u2019ve listened to what he said. \n\u201cAccept my words, or fuck off.\u201d\n(Side note - he was rude af to me. I just thought I deserved it.)\n\nIt\u2019s freeing but also heartbreaking. \nTo realise the only thing I could have done, was say. \n\u201cYou know what. You obviously think that you can be a vegan and eat steak. I don\u2019t. This isn\u2019t going to work. Bye.\u201d\n\nBut then you add in the lovebombing, the trauma bonding, the confusion, the gaslighting, oh dear lord the trauma bonding, and instead you get the ultimate mindfuck of a relationship that was the above. \n\nI actually noticed this when discussing with a friend something he did that hurt me. He could only rationalise it in his own simple terms. He couldn\u2019t see his own shittiness at all. \n\nIn my relationship, I was just trying to make sense of it. Because I wanted to. I wanted him. I wanted to trust him. \nBut I also wanted him to be on my level. And he wasn\u2019t. \n\nI was punished for continuing to challenge him. And perhaps I shouldn\u2019t have.

I was maybe eight or nine (he would have been ten or eleven) when it started, as part of the games we played, he would \"examine\" me for injuries by touching my body, but mostly my genitals. It always happened behind closed doors, and if he heard someone approaching he'd quickly stop. This always made me very uncomfortable, the secrecy of it made it feel wrong, and it happened nearly every time I saw him for a year or two. I never told him \"No\" when he was doing it, but at some point I told him to stop doing it and that I didn't want to play doctor anymore (this was when I was ten or so, he would have been nearly twelve), he did stop touching me directly, but would often \"play fight\" with me, tickling me everywhere, including between my legs, he would also force me to sit on his lap and would massage my back and chest, when these things happened I would tell him no over and over but he never stopped. He continued to do this kind of stuff until I was around twelve, maybe thirteen (he would have been nearly fifteen), then I stopped meeting up with him often, and we slowly stopped talking. Throughout all this, he never made me tough him. He was never rough and didn't hurt me, but I was always very uncomfortable around him as a person, but we were both children, and that is what makes this hard to figure out for me.\n\nI have tried to tell a few people, and some have told me that it was just kids being kids and I'm being dramatic, and others have told me that I was molested.

For the sake of privacy, let's call her Daisy.\n\nOur friendship began in the 7th grade, back when I was a timid girl that still had not come out of her shell. I met Daisy, and we immediately hit it off. I found her to be silly and funny. She stood her ground with anyone and didn't take any shit. I thought she would make a good friend. It was fun for a while until she started to disapprove of my other friends. \n\nShe would do things to them that was rude, like making fun of the way they dressed or making a negative comment. She was jealous of them. One friend in particular who we'll call Emily. Emily and I had met a year before the 7th grade, and by the time Daisy and I had met, we were best friends. \n\nDaisy didn't like her at all, she would tell me things like \"you can't have two best friends.\" and \"you need to choose her or me.\" We would have terrible fights about it, long nights of texting and arguing over who I liked more. I never questioned her behavior until I was older. I believed at the time that this was just how being a teenage girl was like. Fights with friends over dumb stuff. \n\nIt got worse as the years went on. I slowly stopped hanging out with the people that Daisy disliked, she would get upset if I talked to them or if I talked to anyone she did not approve of. In the beginning, I would tell her to stop, and every time she would apologize. But then she would continue to do it, always apologizing and seeming to be genuinely sorry. \n\nI remember one time I was hanging out in the halls at school talking to this boy who was in one of my classes. He was cute, and I kind of liked him. When he and I neared the end of our conversation Daisy rounded the corner with her group of friends and as soon as she saw I was speaking with him her face filled with rage. I quickly said goodbye to him and ran up the nearest stairs. She and her friends followed me, I hid in a classroom. Her friends laughed thinking it was a fun game. I remember feeling scared, like honest to God terrified of her at that moment. It was that instant that I think our relationship changed. I suddenly realized this was not a friendship but ownership. Daisy made fun of the things that I enjoyed, calling my hobbies \"stupid.\" I stopped doing the things that brought me joy because she didn't like them. It felt like I was being forced to be someone else for her. \n\nBy the time we started high school, I didn't talk to any of my old friends. It was only her. The only other people I was allowed to hang out or talk with were her friends. I didn't get along with most of them. I think it may have been because I was jealous of them. She didn't control them like she did to me. They were her friends while I felt like a pet. There was one girl in her group that I actually liked talking to. Her name was Ana. She and I got along pretty well, we had some classes together, so we hung out outside the group. Daisy didn't like that. She didn't like Ana. Daisy treated her bad in the group, made fun of her behind her back and to her face. I wasn't allowed to get close to anyone. I was Daisy's. \n\nMidway through Freshman year of high school Daisy got depressed. She had issues at home that were spiraling out of control. Something finally gave, and she became miserable. The depression made everything worse. I was the only person she confided her mental illness in. Not her parents, not a doctor, not even a trusted adult. Only me, a fourteen-year-old who had no training on how to handle a situation like that. \n\nAll I wanted to do was help her. She was going through a tough time, and I felt terrible for her. Even after her jealous behavior something in me wanted her to be okay. I tried to support her the best that I could. I thought I could handle it. I'll always regret the fact that I didn't tell someone what was happening. She could have gotten the help she needed a lot sooner, and things may have been different. \n\nShe told me everything. Every time she self-harmed, every time something terrible at home happened, every time she felt like she just wanted to end it. She vented it all on to me. It was months of late night texting, I had to stay up because she was up. If she couldn't sleep, I couldn't sleep. So many nights of forcing myself to stay awake, I was practically falling asleep in classes because I was so exhausted. The nights that I fell asleep too early would lead to me being harassed the next day by her. She would say things like \"I needed you to be there for me\" or \"I could have killed myself.\"  I would feel incredibly guilty because I had let her down. \n\nMy grades suffered from my neglect of doing schoolwork. All of my time went to taking care of  Daisy. Her behavior towards me those months was pure resentment. She would snap at me or say one of her famous negative comments. There were times where I actually felt like she was right to be mad at me for doing something as simple as not texting her back fast enough.\n\nShe only got worse, and towards the end of our freshman year, she was talking about suicide more and more. Daisy would bring up killing her self as casually as someone would talk about their hobbies. She once asked me if I wanted her to call me right before she \"did the deed\" or would I rather find out. \n\nDaisy gave me her suicide note on a Thursday in May. She gave the letter to me after school along with a hug. We usually wrote each other notes when we were bored in class, so I didn't think to open it until I was done with my after-school programs. I was sitting in the halls waiting to be picked up when I read it. My phone had died earlier, and I didn't have my charger on me, so I stuffed the note in my pocket and booked it to the closest free phone hanging around. Daisy didn't pick up when I called her, and the message I left her was me close to tears begging her not to go through with it. Pleading her to hold on. When I got home, I plugged my phone in and didn't stop calling her until she eventually picked up. We talked for most of the night. She told me she felt better than she had in a long time. \n\nThe next day I was called down to the counselor's office in the middle of class. When I arrived at the office, she sat me down and showed me a letter. Daisy's letter she had given me. The counselor explained to me that someone had found the note laying in the hallway, read it and gave it to the office worried about what it said. Daisy hadn't put her name in the letter at all, but it had my name. \n\nShe asked me which student the note came from. She told me it needed to be reported so my friend could get help. Up to that moment, I had kept a calm demeanor since Daisy had told me she was struggling. Calm demeanor through all of her mistreatment. But at that moment I finally broke. I cried and pleaded to the counselor not to tell anyone what was happening. I told her that she (Daisy) would hate me. I was so fucking petrified to what Daisy was going to do to me when she found out what was happening.  \n\nIt took some time, but eventually, the counselor got her name out of me and called Daisy down to her office along with her parents. I was sent back to class. Her parents signed her up for therapy so she could adequately work through her issues. \n\nThey didn't tell Daisy that I told them her name. I ended up being the one who disclosed that information to her. Instead of getting mad at me she said to me she was sorry. She revealed to me that the counselor had told her no should be put through what Daisy had put me through. Things between us got better after that. Our relationship was finally starting to feel like a real friendship. But there was still this part of me that she controlled, it was subtle. \n\nThe summer before Sophomore year Daisy confessed to me that she had romantic feelings for me. I was taken aback by the news, but at the time our friendship was going so good, and I had to admit that I also harbored some feelings for her as well. So we began to date. That whole summer was fantastic. She was the first person I had ever dated. I came out to my parents when school started again, and they were happy for me. Daisy hadn't told her parents yet. \n\nI assumed when we went back to school she and I would act like other couples did. But I was wrong. Daisy didn't let me touch her if anyone was watching. If I reached over to touch her hand or put a hand on her back, she would flinch. The same thing happened even when we weren't at school. If we were at a park or the mall, there was no PDA allowed. She wasn't out of the closet yet, and I had no problem with that. But even after she came out, she still reacted the same way. It made me feel like she was embarrassed of me. \n\nIt was only when we were alone that she treated me sweetly. It was those moments that I held onto when she was cold to me. It just got worse as time went on. Daisy would tell me what she wanted me to wear, say to me what physical characteristics about me she didn't like, continuously belittled my interest, told me she wanted me to be thinner.  I felt like her doll that she was trying to make me into her perfect girlfriend. If I stepped out of line, we'd fight, and it would always be my fault. Even in the fights when she did something wrong she'd twist it, so I was still at fault.\n\nWe fought constantly, she brought out this person in me that I hated. I became depressed a few months into our relationship. I was tired of everything. I didn't know who I was anymore when I wasn't acting the way she wanted me to be. The depression leaked through into our relationship, and she was unhappy about it. I didn't receive any aid from her. There was something about that that just made me snap. We broke up halfway through Sophomore year. Daisy has not been in my life since. \n\nI left that high school after Sophomore year and, enrolled in an online school. I isolated myself from everyone for two years. I spoke to only a few old friends from my old high school. Worried that someone would tell Daisy news about me and she'd reach out. \n\nMy depression spiraled out of control as time went on. I would have nightmares about Daisy killing herself, it led to me waking up crying because I'd think it was real. I doubted myself many times if I got in an argument with a friend or a family member about something. I always felt like I was in the wrong. \n\nThe abuse that Daisy had done to me made it hard for me to go back to being the person I used to be.

TW for mentions of mental illness, self harm and a suicide attempt.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA warm greeting to my fellow survivors. I\u2019m on mobile so please forgive me if the formatting is wonky.\n\nI\u2019ve been a member of this sub for quite a while now. I\u2019ve mostly lurked and tried to offer the occasional bit of support to others. \n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to talk about this to most people, but therapists and counsellors don\u2019t seem to take me seriously. So I\u2019m hoping that I can find some help, advice, or even just plain old understanding and empathy here. This is likely going to be long and rambly. Sincere thanks to anyone who has the patience to get all the way through, but I\u2019ll leave a TL;DR at the bottom either way.\n\nAs I said in the title, I\u2019ve been NC with my Nex for 4 years now. I was with him for almost 5 years. It was pretty much the typical relationship with a Narc. Whirlwind romance, started off great and then quickly turned to shit. It started with subtle nitpicking and offhand comments meant to tear me down. (I.e. \u201cNot many other guys would be willing to put up with all this.\u201d)\n\nTo his credit (what little he deserves), at that point in my life I really wasn\u2019t an easy person to be with. I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder and, most alarmingly, Borderline Personality Disorder. For the most part I\u2019ve always been a quiet Borderline. When it\u2019s bad I tend to take my frustrations out on myself rather than others. I struggled with self harm and substance abuse for years. But the fear of abandonment was there, as well as the shakey sense of self, the hyper-sexuality and taking small things far too seriously. If I felt slighted by a friend or relative, after the inevitable heated argument I would cut all contact; they were dead to me. To make matters worse I was convinced that I could overcome it all on my own, so I wasn\u2019t medicated and I wasn\u2019t going to therapy. But even before the Nex and I met in person for the first time (we met on a dating site), I was upfront about all of it. While I was ashamed of my issues, I felt it was dishonest to try and hide them from a potential romantic partner. Little did I know he would end up using it all against me later.\n\nAs the months and years progressed, his behaviour got increasingly volatile. He would fly into rages over the tiniest of inconveniences, nothing I did was ever right or good enough, and he seemed to have an insatiable thirst for drama. Whenever he was having a bad day he would start an argument. Yelling was and still is a major trigger for me, so this would result in me flying into a panic. When I get panicked, it swiftly turns into rage. Between the two of us, these fights could last for hours. By the end he would be happy as a clam because he\u2019d gotten his supply of drama, and I would be simultaneously exhausted and a nervous wreck for days; walking on eggshells for fear of triggering another explosion. Oftentimes the sick bastard would even expect sex when the fight finally ended. While hyper-sexuality was an issue I struggled with at the time, post-blowout shagging was not something that appealed to me. But I didn\u2019t dare refuse him for fear of starting up the argument all over again.\n\nWhenever I tried pointing out that the way he treated me wasn\u2019t okay, he\u2019d claim that I was blowing things out of proportion, that I was crazy. For a long time I believed him, so I spoke to my doctor and finally got on medication to help manage my disorders. The meds were pretty strong; while there weren\u2019t too many side effects, they knocked me out. I would sleep for 12-14 hours at a time, and even when I was awake I was heavily sedated. It made performing daily tasks extremely difficult. Of course, the Nex used that against me too. I was just lazy, he said. I couldn\u2019t do anything right.\n\nI tried to end the relationship many times, but he would always find a way to make me change my mind. Usually it would be the typical \u201cPoor me,\u201d bullshit Narcs are so fond of, sometimes it would be other ways. The last time I tried his usual tricks weren\u2019t working, so he flew into the mother of all rages and kicked my desk so hard that the whole room shook. He ended up breaking his foot. Of course, he refused to let me call an ambulance. If I had any sense I would have called the police and gotten them to escort him to the hospital, but I stupidly drove him there myself. We were together for two more years after that. I can\u2019t be certain, but I\u2019m pretty sure he did it on purpose.\n\nAt that point I realized that leaving had to be his idea. So I completely shut down. I let the depression and misery consume me. I stopped bathing, stopped cleaning, stopped everything that wasn\u2019t an absolute requirement for continued survival. Eventually I repulsed him enough that he started looking for his next victim. He found her and groomed her for half a year, and then finally left me for her. \n\nAt first I was overcome with manic glee. When he drove away I shouted, \u201cGood bye and good riddance!\u201d and then put on music, dancing like a fool, laughing and sobbing at the same time. Not quite able to believe that it was really over.\n\nBut the joy didn\u2019t last. I stupidly went off my meds, thinking that I could handle things on my own now that my biggest source of stress was gone. Going off a high dose antipsychotic cold turkey is never a good idea. Without the medication in my system I lost my appetite and I couldn\u2019t sleep. I averaged a few bites of food and a couple hours of sleep a night for four months. Many nights I didn\u2019t sleep at all, and many days I didn\u2019t eat. Most of my calories came from coffee and cola. I spiralled into a deep depression, overcome by guilt for inflicting that toxic creature on another person. A person with children, no less.\n\nBetween the lack of medication, the guilt, the insomnia and the slow starvation, my mental health declined to the lowest point it has ever been. I was lost in the happy place I go when I can\u2019t stand reality. And then the voices started. \n\nI had experienced pseudo-hallucinations since I was a child, but they only manifested in the form of intrusive thoughts and what was essentially negative self-talk on steroids. But now they were becoming true hallucinations. The voices told me that if I killed myself, I could go to my happy place and live there forever. So I tried. I took a handful of my antipsychotic medication that I hadn\u2019t touched in months. Thankfully it\u2019s nearly impossible to kill yourself with this particular medication; the most it will do is make you pee every five minutes and give you a bit of brain damage. Not to say the latter is a minor thing, but it\u2019s better than your loved ones finding you purple-faced and drowned by your own vomit.\n\nBrain damage is, I believe, what happened to me; albeit minor brain damage. I was reduced to having the mentality of a 6 year old. I couldn\u2019t remember anything. Someone could ask me to do something and by the time I had taken three steps I would forget it and have to ask them to repeat themselves. More alarmingly, the voices that began to plague me before the attempt went from being a whisper in my mind to being full-blown auditory hallucinations that sounded as real as the conversations you hear between people when you walk down the street. The voices also became malicious, instructing me to do things (which I at least had the sense to resist), and threatening to do harm to everyone and everything that I loved. Just to be clear, they weren\u2019t telling ME to do harm; they were threatening to do harm themselves. \n\nThe most alarming thing of all was that one of the voices sounded just like the Nex. The others sounded like a man and a woman that I couldn\u2019t identify. And whenever there were people within earshot, it sounded like they were talking about me. Neighbours, people on the street, people in stores, even people on the radio. They all sounded like they were talking about me. It was terrifying.\n\nOver time, once I went to my Doctor and confessed my \u201csins,\u201d I got back on my medications, I started going to therapy groups and the voices eventually faded to a point that life was livable again. At the very least, I wasn\u2019t hearing strangers on the street talk about me any more. That alone was a relief. My short-term memory also returned mostly to normal and I\u2019m pretty much myself again.\n\nHowever, the voice of the Nex and the unidentified man and woman are still there; though they are more quiet than they used to be. Usually it\u2019s the Nex that I hear. Sometimes it makes threats, most of the time it comments on every thought that passes through my head. It accuses ME of being the narcissist, and insists that the Nex is a veritable saint. And if not a saint, every action was justified. And if every act wasn\u2019t justified, it still wasn\u2019t as bad as anything I did.\n\nI wasn\u2019t perfect. A few times I royally screwed up. In some ways I believe I was just as toxic as him. But I never made a conscious choice to be abusive, and whenever he brought up something that I was doing wrong, I apologized and genuinely tried to do better. But where I had an episode a few times a year, he raged at me several times a week. Not once did I ever get an admission of wrongdoing from him, never mind an apology or any effort on his part to improve.\n\nFor the most part I cope with the voices well. During the day I\u2019m able to keep myself distracted, so they don\u2019t really bother me much. But during the night they\u2019re often far more problematic. It\u2019s difficult to get to sleep some nights. For a while I was convinced that the voices weren\u2019t in my head; that the Nex was secretly stalking me and that he had enlisted the help of strangers to help him drive me insane. But the voices often talk of things that no one else could possibly know. I also moved recently, to rural place with no other people particularly close-by. And I hear the voices from the moment I wake up until I go to sleep. Even if he had somehow found a way to dedicate his life to stalking and tormenting me, he would need to eat and sleep at some point. To this day I can\u2019t decide whether permanent auditory hallucinations or being stalked by a Narc is more horrifying.\n\nI\u2019ve tried getting help from my Doctor, and to her credit she did refer me to therapy groups, tweak my meds and refer me to a psychiatrist. But when the voices persisted they became rather dismissive. I was told that sometimes Borderlines continue to hear voices even when medicated and undergoing therapy. There is some disagreement about whether I have something else going on aside from Bipolar, anxiety and BPD but the general consensus is that I\u2019m not schizophrenic.\n\nI suspect this is a bit of a long-shot, but has anyone else experienced similar psychological disturbances post-Narc? Did you find a way to make it stop? Anything would be appreciated, whether it\u2019s advice, sharing your own story or even just a comforting word.\n\nTL;DR: Got tormented by a Narc for nearly 5 years, tried to kill myself, have experienced auditory hallucinations that sound like my Nex\u2019s voice ever since, and while I have a handful of psychological issues, my medical care providers don\u2019t seem to think that schizophrenia is one of them. Has anyone else here experienced something similar?\n\nThanks for reading. *hugs* if you want them.\n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I don't know how to really explain all of this but, here I go. Sorry if it's a bit messy and long.\n\nI was in a relationship in the end of my junior year of high school to the end of my senior year. It lasted about one year and two months. It was my first relationship, and my only relationship so far. I'm 18 now, and just started college.\n\nBefore getting into the relationship, he had asked me out a few times (sophomore year) -- the first time which was in a group chat. There were times where he called me crazy or similar things like that when I was having a breakdown or a panic attack.\n\nIn the beginning of the relationship, he told me, \"I won't kill myself as long as if you're with me.\" and he's said that I was a necessity of life many times throughout the relationship. I remember crying everytime he told me that, because I didn't want him to harm or kill himself, so I thought that I just needed to make him happy and stay with him. But even when I tried my best to make him feel happy, somehow everything wrong ended up being my fault.\n\nHe would never let me disagree with him. For example, everytime we would plan our dates, I would ask him where he wanted to go or wanted to do. He would always say, \"I don't care, you choose.\" At one point, I asked him to make the decision because I was running out of things to plan and I didn't want him to feel bored. He still made me choose, and we went to watch a movie together. I brought up the issue again in the movie theater, and for some reason he became agitated and began raising his voice, telling me that he was the one choosing everything, and that I didn't plan anything. I knew that was a lie, because I was the one planning most of our dates, but I didn't want to make a scene in public, so I said sorry and let the subject drop. He gave me the cold shoulder after that.\n\n[TW: sexual harassment?]\nThe first time he touched me sexually was without my permission, and it was in a public space. We were watching a movie with my friends at my house, and he just suddenly started touching me sexually and I froze up. I didn't know what to do, because I didn't want to make a scene, and I also couldn't process what was happening fast enough. \n\nHe always did that to me in public, and I felt so gross every single time. He never gave me a warning beforehand, he just did whatever he pleased. He's also twice my size, and very physically strong so it was hard to get him to stop. Even when I told him to stop, he never did.\n\nOne time I was able to push him off and he just ignored me for the rest of the date/hang out. I felt like I did something wrong. But I felt so gross. But I was also so scared to defy him because what if he threatened to kill himself again? He also said that we were already progressing our relationship so slow and that we should be doing more sexual stuff. I wasn't comfortable with it, and I know that I should've said no, I was being stupid. I was just scared of what he would do if I did say no, but I hate myself because I should have said no anyway.\n\nAt one point, he did things that made me throw up afterwards -- but I had to pretend I was okay because he did those things to me right before my friends would come to join the hang out.\n\nHe called me crazy for being jealous, but he was literally flirting with another girl. I told him that him flirting with another girl didn't make me feel good, but he said that I was acting crazy. He'd always tell me how much he loved other girls, how they were so pretty, and that he would leave me for them. Granted, he said all of these things jokingly, but I don't know, it still made me feel bad. \n\nOne time, he hung out with a friend of mine (I didn't mind that), and when he came back he gushed about how sweet and lovely she was (and she is a very lovely person). But he also said that he tired her out. At that point, I felt so disgusted at myself for feeling jealous over that, I thought that I deserved death. I thought I really was crazy.\n\nHe also always told me how bad my memory was and after a while, I just started believing what he said was real, even when my mind was telling me that those things never happened. But at that point I didn't know if I could trust my memory anymore. If he kept saying my memory was bad, it must be, right?\nEventually I started to lose my sense of self, I kept feeling like I wasn't real. I don't really know who I am anymore, because I spent a lot of my time trying to please him.\n\nHe never listened to me when I needed to vent to him. Whenever I told him that I was feeling bad, he'd tell me to just go to sleep, or I'm overreacting, or he would ignore me completely.\n\nI don't know. Is this considered emotional abuse? Or am I just overreacting to everything? It's been a couple months since I ended the relationship, but my mental state right now is still so bad. I've been so depressed and anxious lately and I still get nightmares about this almost every night.\n\nThanks for reading, though.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I told myself for years once I turned 18 I would completely separate myself from my family. My mother always told me she \u201cowned\u201d me until I was 18. But there are a list of things that have made it hard and pushed it passed that date. I moved out, well was kicked out last July when I was 17. Which I will get to later. There\u2019s always some anxiety keeping me in contact with my family , such as the stuff still in my mother\u2019s home I haven\u2019t been able to get back yet, or my cat still in her house. My birth certificate and medical records she keeps locked in a box. The one thing that frequently comes to mind is my mental health record she likes to pass around to people as if it was a yearbook to sign. There is nothing unusual wrong with me other than depression, anxiety and ptsd from years of abuse at her hands. It\u2019s not like my records say I\u2019m homicidal or something. In big bold letters it lists off Depression, Anxiety, Sexual Abuse, and lastly PTSD. She passes it around as if to gain sympathy from people for her \u201craising such a troublesome child\u201d. As if she didn\u2019t cause the problems in the first place. All of my medical records show notes from doctors and physical and emotional evidence from sexual abuse. What young child gets UTI, after UTI for no reason? What young child\u2019s teacher calls the parent to inform them they suspect sexual abuse. Why would a therapist lie and say I have the clear signs and symptoms? Every single time he could get me alone, he would. Everyday in the summer when school would be out and my mom couldn\u2019t watch me, every holiday, every family birthday party. I remember the first time it happened, I think I was 4 or 5, in my favorite princess dress. He looked at me and asked if I wanted to play a game, a new game. I think I was 7 when my aunt walked into the bathroom when he was in there with me. She saw everything and just said \u201coh\u201d. Closed the door and walked away. He went out too. I sat in the bathroom by myself for a long time, wondering what was about to happen. I was so scared but excited because I thought this meant it must be the end of this. He was going to get in trouble and I wouldn\u2019t have to come over here anymore, even if mom was busy. But after waiting a long time I opened the bathroom door, walked into the kitchen. They both looked at me and said nothing. I didn\u2019t understand, I thought maybe I\u2019d get yelled at, if she wasn\u2019t going to help me. But nothing was said . Whenever I tried to speak of it, it was quickly shoved away. Not just by my mother but by every family member. I was called a liar, shunned for speaking of it and forced to act normal at family functions when he would run up to me, pick me up in his arms and kiss me on the forehead. Throw me around like a rag doll in front of everyone, only because he knew he was untouchable. I\u2019m not sure why he was always put before me, maybe because he was smarter than me? Maybe because he never made a fuss of things. Which is what I\u2019d done. Or maybe he was just more like able than me? I always felt dumb and awkward around everyone, I\u2019d get excited about something and be ignored, I swear I tried so hard to be liked, I\u2019d be extra nice, extra cheerful , id wear things I thought my mother would like but no matter what it seemed I was just a bother, a burden. I felt just awkward. I\u2019m really not sure. In elementary and middle school every time I was late or missed school, the office people would be so mean to me. Even make me cry. They acted like I could help that I was late , as if I was the one who drove myself. In 4th grade I missed over 40 days of school. A mixture of being sick from not eating, my mother refusing to get out of bed, and other at home problems. I don\u2019t remember specific details but there was always something weird going on. Now that I\u2019m older I understand things I didn\u2019t back then. Like the bottle of pills my mother kept in her purse at all times with a smiley face drawn on the lid. Some days I\u2019d wake up for school and go to my mothers room spend 20 minutes shaking her trying to wake her and she just wouldn\u2019t wake up. She\u2019d groan, or scream at me, but other days she\u2019d be silent. Eventually I knew just to leave her alone, if she was doing that it meant I was going to school that day. And that was fine with me, I didn\u2019t particularly like school anyway. I knew how to cook by 2nd grade. I\u2019d make myself all my meals and if mom would be awake or willing to eat I\u2019d always make us dinner. But sometimes there wasn\u2019t any good in the fridge, I got used to this. My aunt wrote her phone number down and stuck it to the fridge with a magnet. She told me to call every time we didn\u2019t have food, even if mom told me not to. Even though we barely ever had food, I think I only called a handful of times. I didn\u2019t want to call, mainly because of embarrassment but I also feel guilty. I always felt guilty growing up about everything, no matter where I was. It didn\u2019t matter if it was someone buying me a birthday present or something as stupid as asking for a glass of water. I felt as if I didn\u2019t deserve anything. I still do most of the time. It was embarrassing whenever anyone would come to our house because it was always messy and cluttered. Mom would usually be in bed and If I knew someone was coming over I\u2019d rush around to try and clean up. Even though I wasn\u2019t even 10 years old if a family member came to the house and it was dirty they\u2019d scream at me for not taking better care of the house and not helping my mother. Even though every single day I\u2019d wake myself up for school, make my own lunch, try to either take the bus or walk, go to school all day, walk home. Come home to mom still being passed out, take care of all of the pets, do my homework, make dinner, take a shower and tuck myself in. But those were the better days, the bad ones would be the ones my mom was awake. I never knew what she\u2019d be like, somedays she\u2019d be so nice but anything could set her off in 5 seconds and she\u2019d go crazy, other days she wouldn\u2019t be nice at all. Even if there was no valid reason to be angry my mom would find one. I was always blamed for everything. In 5th grade mom officially lost her at home job, she was suicidal or tried to kill herself I\u2019m really not sure which. I just know that my aunts showed up at the house one day and mom packed her bags, she was laughing the whole time as if everything was okay and funny. They told me to pack one too. Mom got in a different car than me and I had to go stay with family in Louisville. They told me this could\u2019ve been prevented if id helped my mom with laundry or done the dishes more. I didn\u2019t understand why mom would want to kill herself because I didn\u2019t do the dishes , but that\u2019s exactly what they told me. I got to visit her once that time she was there, she bragged that men in the ward were asking her to marry them. She thought it was so funny. I left in tears and my sister told me everything would be okay even though I knew it wouldn\u2019t be. In 6th grade we were always so poor, we never had money for anything. Not school supplies, or clothes, shoes, food. I remember one month my mom started picking up used cigarette buds from ashtrays outside of stores or on the streets, because she felt she couldn\u2019t live without the nicotine. I thought it was gross, but I didn\u2019t say anything. I knew not to. Even though my aunts always switched back from acting like they hated me to being nice, they took my school shopping for 6th and 7th grade. I even got name brand converse which was such a big deal. I didn\u2019t care if they\u2019d said awful things to me, I was so happy to have new shoes and a backpack full of beautiful school supplies. I finally got the pack of neon sharpies that I\u2019d wanted forever. I think sometimes they felt bad for me, but other times they didn\u2019t understand why my mother wouldn\u2019t change for me. I know they wanted her to but blaming me was easier on them maybe. I\u2019m not sure. Maybe it was how they coped. In middle school we moved a lot, our house went into foreclosure multiple times. I was in and out of schools. One only being for two days. I didn\u2019t mind these things, but it was the fact that Mom was always so mean to me during these times. When I was 12 I attempted suicide for the first time, my family called me a spoiled brat for not being grateful for what I had. Even though at this point it felt like I had nothing. As I got older my mom and I started arguing more and more. Mom always took her sleeping pills when she shouldn\u2019t, she had what seemed like and endless supply of Vicodin and Ativan. I remember countless occasions where family members traded prescription pills for other ones. She was always mad at me, I could never do enough and if I had I hadn\u2019t done it right. My mom truly acted as if she hated me, truly truly despised me. As if her life would be better if I wasn\u2019t there. She\u2019d beg people to let me move in with them, and they\u2019d tell her no. She told me she loved her time away from me and she\u2019d do anything to get more of it. I didn\u2019t understand this. I never did anything to her, I always tried to be nice, I started trying to stay in my room more but this made her even madder. Suddenly I wasn\u2019t spending enough time with her , I was a terrible daughter for never being home. Like I said I could never do anything right. The first time I was kicked out I was 15, she really hated me that year. I went to my dads for a couple of weeks before I went home, because somehow his house was just as worse as hers. All through high school my mother tried to sabotage anything and everything for me. She didn\u2019t have my social security card so I couldn\u2019t apply for my driving permit, and she always refused to get another one which kept me from getting my permit when I was 16, I couldn\u2019t get it until I moved out at 17 which has set me back on being able to do a lot of things. She\u2019s purposefully make me late to school, and work. She would walk around the house naked when my friends would come over, she\u2019d say inappropriate things to them and flirt with them. She\u2019d drink while my friends were over and eventually no one wanted to come over. She\u2019d tell me they weren\u2019t real friends anyway. When I was 17 she kicked me out because her current boyfriend wanted her to. At one point he asked her to have me forced into a residential facility so she wouldn\u2019t be legally responsible for me and couldn\u2019t get in trouble for moving away without me. My mother called my CPS worker but she refused, saying this wasn\u2019t appropriate. My mother then asked the CPS worker if she\u2019d get in trouble for \u201cjust leaving me on the streets\u201d my mom got frustrated when she learned she could and would so she signed away custody to me to my father. My father didn\u2019t take care of my because of this though. I didn\u2019t even have a bed at his house, he didn\u2019t have a couch either. If I was at his house I was expected to literally sleep on the floor. I still have neck and back problems because of this. I ended up staying with whoever I could after that, I ended up staying with one of my ex stepmoms for a bit, then a coworker. I spent a few nights a week with my boyfriend but his roommate didn\u2019t want me staying there so a lot of nights i was trying to find somewhere to go even as late as 10pm. I had strangers offering to buy me a hotel room but I didn\u2019t want charity from anyone. My family had all blocked my number at this point, as well as my mom. She hadn\u2019t talked to me in 2 weeks. I went to my moms house with her best friend and her daughter to talk to her and she wasn\u2019t there, we knocked on the front storm door and the plexi glass fell through. It was not shattered but the little knobs holding it in place had broke. The bottom of the window was still attached but at the very bottom the window was falling through.. I started crying and panicking knowing I\u2019d get in trouble for this even though it was an accident. My family members started unblocking me and all calling me saying they were calling the police and if I ever called any of them or went to any of their houses I\u2019d be arrested. I cried and cried and cried. I had no where to go. Nothing to my name, I think I had less than $100 at this point because I had a terrible job, and no one was taking care of me. I was completely paying for myself to eat and taxis because I had no car. My mom sent out a mass text message to my dad, aunts, ex stepmom, and a few friends and said she\u2019d filed a police report and I needed to turn myself in. She called me a terrible\nPerson in this text message and completely humiliated me. Making everyone believe I was a drug addict, and a thief. She told the police I had broken into our house and stole her hydrocodones. Which I didn\u2019t. If anyone knows me they know I don\u2019t do drugs, drink or smoke because I know what it does to people obviously. Why she had hydrocodones in the house in the first place I\u2019m sure you can understand at this point. My dad screamed at me for an hour before taking me back to his house. I cried and waited for the police to come get me for something I hadn\u2019t done. They never showed up. They never did, I\u2019m sure they realized what was going on and didn\u2019t want to waste their time. But my cps worker did show up that day and said my mom had been harassing her about taking me away. At this point I hadn\u2019t seen or talked to my mom in WEEKS. She had my number blocked still. My mom didn\u2019t talk to me again until I was in the CPS office. My cps worker had picked me up from a house I was staying at and took me there for an interview. They needed parental consent and my dad wouldn\u2019t answer the phone even though they tried calling. She said she was going to try calling my mom, I said my mom didn\u2019t care and wouldn\u2019t answer. But she did. She gave them consent then asked to speak to me. I was so confused, I hadn\u2019t spoken to her in weeks and I had been told if I ever tried to contact her again she was going to press harassment charges against me and a restraining order. I answered the phone and said \u201cHello?\u201d She said \u201cHI BABY!!\u201d Really loudly.. I was confused but I knew what she was doing. It was the thing she does after she\u2019s gone through a phase, she\u2019ll randomly be nice again but it never lasts. Turns out while I was homeless trying to find a place to sleep , she\u2019d gone on vacation to the beach. Yeah, to the beach. I was hurt and confused and that was the moment I think I lost all respect for my mother. I know a lot of people don\u2019t understand why it hadn\u2019t been sooner but my whole life I tried to give my mom the benefit of the doubt. I loved my mom, no matter what. But at this point she was purposefully trying to hurt me and we both knew it. I think she knew she\u2019d gone too far this time, I would always come back to her no matter what but I think she was actually scared this time. After my dad had hit me a few more times she finally let me come home and she was nice to me. She was trying but she knew that it was over. I didn\u2019t trust her at all. I spent 5 nights a week at my boyfriends house until I moved in, in November. I never talked to her. I distanced myself as much as possible. On Christmas she begged me to come over and I did. She cried and said she missed me so much. I missed her too but all she\u2019s ever done is tricked me and hurt me. She\u2019ll gain my trust to use things I\u2019ve told her in secret against me. She\u2019s taken money I\u2019ve earned from my jobs since I was 15, she\u2019s kicked me out. Ignored my abuse. Called me a liar. Filed a false police report against me( yes it has been dropped). Put me in a house with my dad knowing he abused me. Let me be sexually abused for years. Hit me. Locked me in rooms. Not provided me with basic food, clothes, sometimes she wouldn\u2019t even bother to pay the water or electric bills and they\u2019d be shut off all the time. I\u2019m not trying to sound like a brat, I\u2019m not trying to get attention or anything but people don\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t have a family. This is why. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a million things I forgot to put in here but there\u2019s way too many things that happened over the years. ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

I suggested some relationship fixes and she shot me down.. It was all in my head, all the lies were 'miscommunication', etc. I fired back with the evidence and a proposal of how we could make things better. Then she reverted to full victim mode and 'couldn't cope', she was too tired and too emotionally drained. I told her I loved her and I'd be ready to deal with it when she was because our relationship wasn't working (taking joint responsibility). \n\nA week later she messaged me, like that exchange had never happened, with a video message from her son saying he loved me and I was the kindest person in the world and a joke in the caption from her with tonnes of love heart emojis and xxxx's and laughing emojis. I didn't reply. In that week, an event had taken place which was the catalyst that sparked the initial confrontation and I was still raw. I had spent the entire week crying myself to sleep. The message she sent me, refusing to address our previous exchange was a slap in the face.\n\nAnd that was it, the last contact we had, almost 2 months ago.\n\nIt hurts. It really hurts, because it cements EVERYTHING. She never meant any of the positive things she said about me, she just used me. I guess I should say, in our original exchange, I told her I wanted our relationship to be more casual, because I missed doing fun things together, we'd stopped making making memories and I was just focusing on all her deception and how much she expected of me with nothing in return and I was starting to resent her for it. Urgh.. It's pathetic, isn't it? \n\nI was prepared for anger, I was prepared for tears, I was prepared for nastiness, I was prepared for grovelling (all responses I've received from her previously)... But I wasn't prepared for silence. I feel used up and thrown away. \n\nI've spoken to some friends who think that she sent that message as an olive branch and I should've replied, but I call bullshit on that. She wanted to get me back in line- fall into line or dismissal from the ranks. My lack of a reply, imo, showed I was still waiting for a proper response, giving her the opportunity to try.. But I'm so worthless to her as a human being in my own right, that I don't even deserve that. I don't deserve to have feelings, I don't deserve a say in how the actions of other people directly impact me.\n\nIt was her birthday this month, I was tempted to send a text.. but again, it felt wrong. So much was said that has not been addressed because she chose not to address it. I felt terrible. \n\nI worry all the time that she will message me, or I'll see her in the street or at the shop. \n\nShe has my Playstation 4 at her house, I bought it and said she could keep it at her house so the kids could use it and our little friendship group could play, but it would be mine. I made that clear, as in the past, I have bought things (like for her home gym) and she has sold them/thrown them out without even asking me if I can take them away. I want to ask for it back, but I don't really want to take it away from the kids.. but I have a suspicion she probably will sell it to spite me, if she hasn't sold it already.. I also don't want to have to deal with the confrontation of that situation. \n\nI feel like this post makes me sound really weak, and I don't think that's the case. I think that now she's aware of the amount of knowledge I hold, she knows she has no chance of manipulating me anymore (and she wasn't really manipulating me before, I was just suffering in silence), and so she has no purpose for me. She keeps liking posts on instagram about only having time for 'good people' and such, and I think she believes that.. But in her mind, good people are those who serve the purpose you want them to serve and don't stray from the role you set for them. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

We\u2019ve had ups and downs and something clicked inside me last weekend when we had a huge fight. We\u2019ve been doing surprisingly well for months and for over a year I\u2019ve come to terms with his narcissistic ways. I was okay with it and although he can be draining, I was balancing well and maintaining our relationship with ease. I\u2019ve done my research, and come to terms with what it is to date him and only because I do truly care about him and love him. But I\u2019ve just been questioning what it would be like to stay now. \n\nThe trigger click: We we\u2019re out with friends last Friday and he was being very cold to me throughout the night. I was in a great mood and everyone seemed to be having a great time. I rode the high of the night home and was in an awesome mood and the second we walked in the door he started with me. Just battered me to the ground pretty much. He said \u201cI annoy him\u201d and he asked to be left alone. I was really confused and kept pushing what I did? Which was NOTHING. He preceded to bash me and said he couldn\u2019t stand me to a point where I was breaking down in tears apologizing. I just didn\u2019t understand what was happening and I was still so adamant on kissing his ass. I felt pathetic. Even in my fit of tears and emotional distress he continued to bring me down. He said I was even more annoying, pathetic even and it was ridiculous that I was upset. At some point I just got so frustrated I lost it on him and got angry. Things escalated and many words were exchanged. Full blown screaming match which ended in an emotionally exhausting night. All over him being \u201cannoyed\u201d over nothing while I innocently tried to make up for whatever(I still don\u2019t know wtf I did wrong) and sucked his ass while he what felt like disgarded me like a trash bag that he was repulsed by. \n\nThese last few days I\u2019ve just been down. We made up to each other and things have seemed to be okay between us. He came by yesterday and just seemed distant. Cold. I kept insisting that he didn\u2019t seem right and was doing sweet things and giving him love that I know he didn\u2019t deserve. He just seemed repulsive to my overall being. I would ask for a kiss and he just pushed me away like I was a chore. Like he was disgusted with me. I tried so hard to please him and it\u2019s like he wanted nothing to do with me. And just kept saying I was being weird/demanding/annoying. I just keep asking myself wtf I\u2019m doing? I feel like a slave to his moods. When we\u2019re up we\u2019re soaring and when we\u2019re down I feel lost. I\u2019ve been with him for so long that I can\u2019t picture a life without him now. I\u2019ve read through this sub seeing others take that plunge and I just don\u2019t know if I can. I am scared of how hard the days that would come would be. We have plans to travel together in a few months and so many other things ahead. He was so cold yesterday and gets like this and it breaks my heart into pieces. I spend so much time picking up the pieces of myself that he breaks yet I feel like I can\u2019t do it without him. \n\nI know if I do this I can\u2019t go at it alone. I don\u2019t have much support and I am too far gone in our relationship to just let go like this. I feel like I\u2019d break at the first weak milestone and cave into whatever happens. I even questioned if I left him if he\u2019d even try to mend things. I obviously can\u2019t talk about any of this with him and anyone I feel enough trust in to talk about this with will tell me to leave and I\u2019m not sure I want such a biased opinion as I know this is more than stay or go and it\u2019s complicated because of how invested I am. I\u2019m at a standstill and I\u2019m unsure what to do. I want to stay in ways but I want things to improve. I don\u2019t want my happiness being sabotaged whenever he sees it fit. And I hate knowing and feeling that he gives zero care when I\u2019m upset yet I drop my entire life for a minor thing for him. There\u2019s so much give and not enough take. Nothing seems fair but I know I\u2019ve chosen to \u201cdeal\u201d and I\u2019ve put myself here. Did I just make the biggest mistake of my life? I see my life flashing before me and I don\u2019t know how I can make a comeback from this. And I don\u2019t know why I haven\u2019t realized any of this before. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Mostly when I was a kid, my brother who's my age used to fight with each other at age 12-14 or 15. It started off like any other siblings, arguing, fussing at each other, blaming them for stuff. Then idk why or how, but it got physical. I'd start fights and it'd be like abusive fights.. I started fights for months. Then I got super tired of it because my brother is stronger than me. Then he'd initiate fights.. It was bad. He'd throw my stuff I cared about off my two story window, hit me, punch me, kick me hard, yank my hair and drag me with my hair, he'd hit me and throw stuff at me. locked me outside, threaten to kill me, stabbed me with a ink pen, and i took my sock off and the blood from that soaked up the blood and had to throw the entire sock away.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI used to hit, punch, kick, yell and scream at him like he did to me, I had fingernails though, so he'd hit me and i'd scratch him to get out of it and to go hide and cry by myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo all that happened.. My parents would tell us to stop sometimes, and punish us more for it. Then, after awhile since i initiated it for awhile and stopped, my mom didn't defend me from then on.. She'd always ask what i did to start. and (or) deserve it.\n\nThat was very painful for me because she wasn't there for me..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo body knew it, but I was being sexually abused when all this fighting broke out.. I knew i couldn't say anything.\n\nOn a side note: My dad tells me to shut up or to shut my mouth if he says something disrespectful to me or my brothers, I can't defend myself. He doesn't want to hear anyone's side but his. He acts so mad and disgusted at me and my brothers everyday too.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom on the other hand.. She is another story.. She goes around acting like me and my brother who's my age are the laziest kids on the planet.. we're both 18 now mind you.. We both work full time, I'm an athlete, so I have to train a lot everyday or every other day.. If we don't get out chores done, she'll go on a huge tyrant about how we don't respect her, and don't listen to her wishes... It's kinda hard to do that when me and my brother are working full time, and are trying to have lives of our own.. I haven't seen her do chores in years, plus she isn't showing the two younger brothers how to do chores..\n\nPlus when me and my brother get chores done she says something sarcastic like \"Oh it's about time you got this done, don't expect me to tell you that you did a great job after not doing it for days\" Which i kinda see her point, but she doesn't have to say that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf i tell my mom as simple as this she'll get mad and go off; I told her that by her going to public school, and when she graduated, she might have seen other kids in her grade so they're not complete strangers to her when she graduates. I'm homeschooled, so going into it I assumed that i didn't know these kids(but i did, and that's not the point of this) the point is when i said that she went on a HUGE TYRANT saying that I didn't know what she went through, you can't assume about her when I know nothing, I don't know how she felt or how alone she felt... Basically she was saying that  assumed about her, which is true, but not like that.. then she went on to feel sorry for herself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI said to my mom yesterday that she looks like she's mad at stuff all the time, and she went tf off.. Her face was looking mad.. I noticed it, so what? She shuts me down when she accuses and assumes stuff about me, she gets to ALWAYS have her say, I mean ALWAYS. but she shuts me down and acts like i'm the biggest pain to defend myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe tells me on the daily how I don't do anything.. I do some chores and i workout. Most days, I do self- care stuff and babysit my brothers when they get home,,  I don't like how she always has to be right, always state her opinion first and if I disagree then I'm either ungrateful, hateful (for defending myself to her) or this disrespectful ugly child.\n\nI'm starting to wear again and become depressed.. it's hard to live 24/7 in this.. I'm saving up for a car and saving up to move out. but it's hard to always deal with..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne time when i was 16. I was alone at home so I thought it'd be smart to go to a park and go do my homework there.. So i left without my phone, without permission (which I knew was wrong but saw the upsides) I was gone for a few hours, my homework was done, so I drive my bike home.. I had a watch so i thought i was going to be on time for my counselor's appointment so I thought I was all good. Then when I pull in the driveway, I see my dad's van, and I'm debating whether or not i'm going to book it somewhere else or not.. I should have. My dad stops the van, my brother jumps out and flat out punches me in my face and knocks my glasses off.. I run inside to get my jacket and so I can leave. My dad gets inside and starts screaming at me, I run upstairs to put my stuff up.. I go back down, he calls my mom and he's asking me where i've been, what i've been doing, i tell him I did homework, he was saying how I wasn't and how I \"purposely ran away\" to avoid my counseling appointment.. I told him hat that wasn't true.. Anyways, my mom gets home, we talk it out,  it's ok, then someone says or does something, I get triggered, and I think i threatened to hit my brother. (I was sexually abused in my past) so my dad held me down in that same position (he doesn't know about the abuse) but I yanked my way out of that because that triggered all these emotions, and i ran to get my bike, and my dad goes and deflates the tires, then I run to leave, then he blocks the door.. Then he goes to the bathroom, and while he's in there I make a break for the door, he comes out of the bathroom, and he's cussing at me \" don't go out that damn door, I'll call the cops if you leave, etc.\" I run out and he yell cusses at me, and i'm running out of the house.. I need time to cry and unpack all that.. I was in so much pain physically and emotionally, I needed to walk.. So I hid in the alleyways for hours and cried almost the whole time.\n\nI go home 6 hours later, my mom thought something happened, my dad went to the police station and filled out a missing person's report thinking something happened to me, I'm thinking that all that is a load of BS because of how they treated me earlier that day..\n\nThey were acting all hurt and why did you do this to us and etc.. I was tired and slept in my closet or under my bed because I was afraid they'd hurt me again..\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI told a cps worker a year later and my parents denied it all and called it lies from the bottom of hell.. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've tried running away times before but never had anywhere or anyone to go to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre my parents abusive or am I overreacting?

Also sorry for how long this is in advance. Although it's extremely long there is a lot I had to leave out.\n\nI'm a 20 year old female who lives with my uncle and grandmother. I take care of my grandmother 24/7, the only break I get is the few times i'm allowed to go to my best friend's house, and the occasional time I get to spend on the internet which isn't all that often. I have a very unhealthy sleeping schedule as my grandmother and uncle constantly ask me to do tasks all hours of the day, i.e. doing the laundry at 3 a.m., and essentially take shifts keeping me awake all the time, so the most sleep I get is a couple of hours accumulated throughout the course of a few days so i'm always exhausted. Even though i'm always doing things they constantly yell at me (mostly my uncle) telling me i'm lazy and never do anything, they tell other people that I never do anything, this has spread to potential employers as well (I live in a small town so word spreads fast) which has ruined my chances of getting a job. My grandma raised me so my family all agree that it's the least I could do to take care of her, the only payment I get for doing so is getting to live here and the few and far between \"thank you.\" I'm always afraid, constantly anxious, in fear of my uncle for past experiences. He will get mad and yell at me for *anything*. I dread being in the same room as I'll start shaking and even crying which in turn only makes him angrier and thus making him lash out at me even more. I'm paranoid all the time, i'm scared of making him angry. I know this is abuse and I know I need to leave but it's not as simple as just getting up and leaving, I don't know who will take care of my grandma if I leave which is the sole reason why I haven't left yet along with other reasons. I know i'm avoiding the inevitable because the moment I leave is the moment my family will completely abandon me. My friend knows of my situation and has saved money and bought a cheap house that he's working to repair in order for me to have somewhere to go, it won't be ready for another 4 or 5 months and i'm not sure i'll last that long. Yes, I have attempted to leave before but it resulted in a physical altercation with my uncle, so I haven't told him or my grandma the plan to leave. I know the day I do finally leave that if I don't have he necessary protection, i.e. my friend or the police there with me, that all hell will break loose, and for that reason alone it scares me.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

However, when I screw up, he tends to yell(I mean yell/shout) at me pretty strongly and berates me(saying I don't care about anything, which isn't true as i do well in uni and etc) as he is kind of a perfectionist. When I was a teenager, I left my room unclean a lot and he would yell at me to clean it and on two occasions, he's called me useless/worthless due to it. No, I don't think he means it, his anger gets the better of him and times, he's told me he doesn't like yelling to make me feel bad or something but that doesn't make it hurt less and sometimes, thinking about it makes me on the edge of tearing up as it really hurts emotionally. Recently, we were going to meet the president of my country(niger) and we had to wear these long arab styled robes to appear formal. I was wearing shorts underneath and when my dad saw that, he got super angry and nearly swore and screamed at me to change(he probably thought I was being disrespectful but I only go to my home country for vacation and didn't know you could not wear shorts underneath/did not mean to show I don't care but i couldn't explain myself) and asked if I'm stupid or something. This recent yelling hurts as my dad isn't interested in hearing me explain myself and I have to silently take his yelling as I'm too scared to say anything. I am still feeling resentful at this recent yelling and expect more, but I really don't like dealing with it. I was wondering, what should I do in this situation?", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

I was intensely overqualified, my co-workers were incompetent and straight-up malicious. I made absolutely no money. I was 25 and living with my parents in my hometown. I hated my life. I applied to job after job after job and was rejected from every one. I had interviews that were great, and was told I'd \"definitely gotten\" the position only to have them call me two days later to say they'd \"gone in a different direction.\" I was constantly being rejected from employers, and on top of that, my NEx was fucking with my brain.\n\nHe never had time for me. He would constantly be messaging me over social media \u2014 we were never not talking. But when I expressed that I needed more than a relationship over messenger, he would make up excuses as to why he couldn't see me. He never had time. He was tired. He had rehearsals. His work schedule was weird. He'd made plans with family. He was writing and couldn't be disturbed. He would constantly tell me how much he missed me and loved me and wanted to be with me, but never once did he show it. \n\nIt got to the point where I had to go to therapy. I told him that the topic that came up the most was him, and that my therapist had expressed that it seemed like my needs weren't being met. He was very uncomfortable and upset over the fact that I had discussed him with my therapist. After I told him that, I didn't see him for two months. But he messaged me every. single. day. I begged to see him. Offered to take time off work to fit into his schedule. Told him that I'd be there any time he had even an hour free. Nothing. I told him I really needed his help. I wasn't doing well. I was pregnant with misery. \n\nEventually, I showed up at his house. I knew that he didn't have plans that day, and I was so sick and tired of begging someone to spend time with me who should have *wanted* to be with me. I stood with him in his kitchen while he explained all the things that he'd been doing. He was spending a lot of time with one particular friend group, and when he started saying that he had dropped everything one Saturday to meet one of these friends for breakfast because he \"wasn't doing well\" and \"needed support,\" I immediately started crying. I didn't even realise that I had until I saw his fact twist from contentedness to shock horror.\n\nI cried because he was being so supportive to this person he'd only met months before, but wouldn't spare an hour to make sure I was okay. I'd asked him to check in on me and he never once did. I expressed how difficult it was for me to ask for help, and I had **begged** him for support, and I couldn't get it. The person he claimed to love. The person he claimed to want to marry. The person he called the love of his life. The person who would have done anything to make him happy. He couldn't spare an hour for me. Not even a \"I know you're having a tough time, let me know what I can do, and I'll do it\" text. \n\nI wanted to die. I looked for ways to die. In my head, I begged every person who passed me on the street to take out a gun and shoot me. Eventually I understood that my only two choices were to break up with my NEx or die. Luckily, I chose the former. \n\nNo one knows how close it came. If I had been with him another month, I wouldn't be writing this now. Please find the strength to leave. I'm not going to say that everything in my life is perfect, because I still have intense PTSD surrounding that relationship, but my mental health is MILES better than it was a year ago, and yours can be, too.

Or since childhood, if you consider the abuse my sisters put me through as a child. Most of my romantic relationships have been toxic or abusive in some way, with only a few exceptions. \n\nMy ex came on here and made some long post about everything I put him through, and how my inability to cope affected him. He did shed some light on how I had some toxic behaviors and hurt him in ways I didn't realize, especially in terms of substance abuse, but he called me an alcoholic (not true) and frequent drug user (also not true, not even remotely). He also said a bunch of other things that were untrue, but whether they were misremembered, misinterpreted, or intentionally falsified is anybody's guess at this point. \n\nWhat I'm most upset about is that he genuinely thinks what I've done to him these last couple months was abusive. In reality, I needed space to clear my head. I asked for it, he agreed to give it to me, and then he didn't. He continued messaging me and reaching out to the point of harassment. The first time I heard him call me abusive was after a long day of frequent messaging (which I ignored), followed by a series of phone calls at 2 in the morning, all of which went unanswered until the 5th call in a row, when I finally answered, said \"I am trying to sleep,\" and immediately hung up. The result was another slew of messages, accusing me of being \"abusive and evil.\" \n\nWhat I did there was not abusive, it was self-preservation. \n\nThis guy cyberstalked me for at least 2 months after I ended the relationship and moved 1500 miles away, and I have reason to believe he's been reading my Facebook messages as well. On top of all this, he's recently been reaching out to people I'm close with, some of whom he's never even met, and feeding them the same lies. I guess he's claiming he's just \"trying to set the record straight\" or something, I don't know, but he's told them that I'm a liar and anything I've said about him was probably a lie. I don't even talk about him though, the guy is just delusional. \n\nReading what he wrote about me, like I said, was sobering in moments. He did call me out on some toxic behaviors that were legitimate, that I do realize I am guilty of, and that I want to take responsibility and accountability for and try to change. But most of it was just lies, and seeing people rally around him and defend him like that is... a complicated thing to process. \n\nI don't even know how to feel about all of it. Sort of everything all at once, and then just numb. And the cycle repeats, like it always does. And I don't know what to do. ", "subreddit": "abuse"}

She made me felt special in ways that no one ever has. She would surprise me by visiting me during the weekends unannounced and would compliment me regularly about how I looked. The sex was great and we just enjoyed our lives together. Things started going downhill when she moved 3 hours away to another city to transfer into a four year university (she had enough credits to transfer from community college). We would text every day and FaceTime. It all started when she started crying during our FaceTime calls and when I asked her what was bothering her she would just tell me that she was lonely but never really get into detail what was bothering her. I can recall that during our dates together she would be silent and somewhat cold to where I would try to spark up a conversation and I\u2019d get a simple reply which really led to nowhere. I also attribute our lack of chemistry to our lack of common hobbies. But what really bothered me was that she would always bottle up her emotions and never tell me what bothered her. One time when we were out for dinner she got upset that I went for seconds because I told her that I was trying to lose weight and she got upset that I got another serving of food because to her that was counter productive to me losing weight. Mind you im not out of shape I\u2019m a pretty athletic guy so that caught me by surprise. The next thing was she commented that I was being rude to the cashier at the store out of nowhere. It\u2019s like she\u2019s getting at me with little things that seemed to bother her. The straw that almost broke the camels back was when I found out that she was on a dating website while we\u2019re in a committed relationship. I forgave her for that and things were okay for the time being. \n\nThings started falling apart when we visited her parents for Christmas in another state. She told me she was nervous about me meeting her parents and I totally understood that. However she started being distant while we were there. One time while we were sleeping she got out of bed and slept at the sofa instead. Her reasoning for this was that I moved a lot in bed and she couldn\u2019t get a good nights sleep. I told her that she could have woken me up but instead she acted all hurt about it and what was worse was her parents was concerned as to why she chose to slept at the sofa which made me super uncomfortable about the whole situation. This trend continued throughout the trip where she would be distant and every time I asked her what was bothering her she would not open up. One time when we went to dinner I asked her if she wanted anything to eat and she said no and I kept asking her if she was sure and she said yes so there I was eating by myself at a restaurant which made it super awkward. \n\nWhat finally made me leave her 2 days before Christmas was when she confronted me about being anti social while her, her best friend and mom were baking cookies. At this time I just wanted her to enjoy some time with her family and her best friend since she doesn\u2019t get to see them often. Then out of nowhere right before we go to bed she asks my why I was being so anti social. I told her that I was just minding my own business in the living room since I didn\u2019t know how to bake cookies. By this time I was dead set on leaving. So she drove me to the airport and on the way she begged and pleaded for me to stay. I really wanted to but then she said that she though we weren\u2019t going to last in the long term so that sealed the deal for me. \n\nHowever I started regretting my decision and begged her back. She said that she\u2019s okay with giving me another chance. So I met her at her apartment a few days after I left and it just felt awkward. I wanted to talk to her about the relationship and as usual she was being distant. It also didn\u2019t help that her best friend was there too and I suspect that she did not want me to be around while they were doing their thing, like going out and partying. I wanted to talk to her about where things are going and about what she thought about us, whether or not if she still wanted to be with me, and she told me that I was putting words into her mouth. I told her that I just wanted to communicate but she was having none of it and she told me to get out of her room. \n\nI seriously thought that was the end of the relationship but I begged and pleaded again and this time she said she needed space. But as the desperate guy that I was at that time I continued to text her that I still loved her and she just gave me the cold shoulder and kept giving me excuses as to how she had too much on her plate right now. I felt like I was being strung along. The begging and pleading went on for about a month and a half until we face timed for the last time about a week ago. \n\nI could see in her face that she was cold and doesn\u2019t even care about how I felt. She kept saying that I pushed her away when I begged and pleaded and I owned up to my mistakes. She told me she gave me 6 or 7 chances but what really kills me is that she never really gave me a real chance. She told me if I had not begged or pleaded that she might have given me a chance but now she doesn\u2019t have any feelings for me. \n\nI get it that it was my fault that I left and that it was my fault that I begged and pleaded but at the end of the day she made me feel like it was all my fault.

I seemed to have evolved the ability to shut out terrifying circumstances as well. They call this disassociating and I feel like a helpless monster when I realize I've been doing this for a long time to cope with my ex family. I'm safe from them now. I learned how to call up the buzz of happiness to get through really suffocatingly dark times alone and I was shaped to be that fake happy by the only two adults in my life who paid me any attention after my mom died. I see now I was conditioned by these abusive grandparents to not express pain and be an \"entertainer\"  to recieve love and praise from them. I know that that was never love and that was not okay. If I expressed pain, they pretended not to hear me or explained to me why my pain wasn't happening.  That is disturbing and caused me to live with serious physical conditions that I shouldn't have. I don't consider them okay but they did and I couldn't tell. \n\nSo now I know that I was disassociating and have been expressing fake happiness. It reminds me of stories like those about orphans who stop crying from being touch starved in an orphanage.  I didn't have my own pain alarms that it wasn't okay if I hurt, because of living on those drugs and with those people so long. I felt some physical pain still, but now I think of it as totally awful, rather than kind of used to living that way before. \n\nI learned a lot of stuff about this in psychology classes in college and the teachers spoke about the people in a very voyeuristic way.  These aspects of human survival processes were talked about like shameful,  zoo creature exhibits. The movies and books we watched treated the people with complete disrespect and lack of humanity and compassion. I've met people who practice psychology who were kind and good people, but the world I was exposed to in undergrad was...disgusting.  I went on to a different career. I guess this must have been lurking inside of me, writing this has let me pin point the problem. After writing, I think I realize that new mass media depicts these things as horrible,  not okay states for a human to go through and I agree. They show people who survive this as heros to be loved and revered. That I went through that is truly awful, but nothing to be ashamed of or personally responsible for or indicative of a personal deficiency.

I\u2019m not usually a dramatic person but there are some things you can do to a friend that are so fucked up people deserve to know that about you. It ended up blowing up and a lot of people sent me messages saying they were sorry or telling a story about how he was a douchebag to them in the past. And I also found out he used the same sob story about how he had no where else to go and moved in with people before many times only to steal things from their house or burn bridges with them somehow). I knew it would piss her off because she was so crazy strict about me telling anyone about what happened right after it happened. She would log in to my social media and rage at me for paragraphs if I was venting to someone about it or asking someone for support. And this was after she broke up with me. She didn\u2019t want anyone to know what happened. Time and perspective made me go I don\u2019t really care who the hell knows and it\u2019s not my job to keep this girl\u2019s cheating secret for her. She treated me like shit. It was abusive of her to rage at me so hard for telling people what happened especially after we had already broken up. \n\n\n\nAnyway she\u2019s like \u201cyou need to call me\u201d and I just say \u201cwhy?\u201d She says \u201cbecause I want to tell you I\u2019m going on vacation to Palm Springs this summer obviously. What do you think? The tweet\u201d. The fact that she felt the need to mention she was going to Palm Springs within the very first few seconds of talking to me again was very telling to me. As if I should be impressed or jealous of her. She tweeted like \u201cjust dropped 1200 on Palm Springs tickets ahhhhhh this is fine!\u201d as if it was a joke about the high price and not letting everyone know she was going on an expensive vacation. Her fronting about the Palm Springs trip so hard on social media made me suspicious and when she immediately brought it up to me despite the context not really being an appropriate time to brag about your expensive vacation it confirmed to me she has some deeply narcissistic traits. And part of the reason I felt so discarded and like she had moved on so easy and her life was awesome without me, is because she wanted to create that illusion and make me feel that way. The Palm Springs trip has the added benefit of hopefully making me feel bad and jealous. But honestly she could vacation to fucking El Dorado and I wouldn\u2019t be impressed considering she blew one of my friends in my fucking room.\n\n\nAnyway eventually I\u2019m just like I\u2019m not taking it down it doesn\u2019t mention your name and if you didn\u2019t want people to know about it so bad then you shouldn\u2019t have done it and been so non-apologetic about it. You can\u2019t tell me to not tell anyone about it. You made my life a complete nightmare. I asked her, one last time, \u201chow could you do that after all the time we spent together and the things we said to each other? I don\u2019t understand how you could even do that\u201d. Her response was just a bunch of random emojis. Like I guess just telling me she was tired of the question and she wasn\u2019t going to answer it in a really immature and disrespectful way. I said \u201cI have never been hurt by anyone like that before. And no one has ever talked to me that way before. I think our relationship was abusive\u201d and she just stared replying in French. She takes French classes and she is always showing off her French and bragging about it. Well now wasn\u2019t the time to clearly not be taking me seriously and just show off your French skills. I was telling her I think she was abusive and she was just not taking it seriously at all. The complete lack of awareness or care for other people\u2019s emotions is stunning. I can\u2019t imagine someone telling me \u201cno one ever hurt me before like you\u201d after I did objectively treat them like complete shit and just send them emojis back as a fuck you deal with it. But obviously I should just go no contact and not answer if she tries to talk to me next time. She\u2019s shown that she just literally does not give a shit about the bad things she did and she will always, ALWAYS be the victim even if the situation is \u201cshe had a second boyfriend who was one of my friends who was living with me behind my back for months and broke up with me to be with him\u201d. Still she is the non-apologetic victim and if I was a better boyfriend it wouldn\u2019t have happened. \n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He took out all the boxes except for the one she put on top.. the cheerleader was talking about how petty and how much of a dick he was being. It\u2019s great that others can see what I see. Finally.

Now he's ruined all his work relationships where our boss actively wants to fire him while I've thankfully stayed in good graces. He attributes his lack of success to made up reasons like 'they don't know how to invest in their people' while ignoring any advice that we try to give him. He even started me down when I challenged one of his 'reasons' until I backed off. He's been behaving more erratically which understandably scares everyone.

I am and always was the scapegoat  of the family due to my \"condition\" as i prefer to call it. My father  had an intense job and is the definition of a workaholic. My mother  works with children but due to her mental and spiritual state flat out  neglected her own.\n\nAs a kid due to my  flat out lack of social skills due to said neglect I became the school  pariah and quite possibly exhibited symptoms of some mild form of  Pediatric Schizophrenia or some form of mental escapism (Held onto  imaginary friends for much much longer than should have normally).  I  was socially clueless about virtually everything and was one of the most  naive and easily manipulated kids on the planet. Good natured but odd  and intelligent enough.\n\nAt home my life  mostly consisted of: Come home, go to room, do homework, go do chores,  parents would find something to bitch at or yell at, younger sister  would manipulate me into doing something or would play the victim and  sick my dad on me, go back to room and repeat ad nasuem for 12 years.\n\nMy  mother is diagnosed with manic-depressive and so she was always either  out partying with friends or hiding out in her office or room skulking.  My father pretty much used me as a form of labor for whatever project he  had going on at that time and then stayed in his office to focus on  work. On top of that he is a perfectionist and one of those parents who  would constantly and i mean constantly lord over how tough his life was  as a kid.  I was never taught what taxes were (learned that myself  through history and econ at school), never had a bank account until I  was 17, job until I was 18, my dads advice on dating was pretty much  \"grab her by the pussy\".\n\nThey were  physical abuse was not common but mentally and emotionally my father  would break items, roar in my face, slap me if i started crying because  \"wuss\" essentially. At some point if I neglected doing my chores he  would dump the stale animal water over my head and make me wait outside  sometimes at night and sometimes at winter (in the northwest).  On top  of this we lived on a nice but rural area outside of town so going to  hang out with friends was a virtual impossibility.\n\nAs  a teen I developed a porn addiction and video game/media addiction as a  form of escape and relaxation but only secluded myself more as my  family broke more and more apart. This was also a form of rebellion as  living under the conditions.\n\nDuring  school as a teenager I finally became aware of my situation and that  just turned me into a ball of rage and anger. I hated it but I just  didnt know what else to do. No matter what I did or said they just  brushed things off as \"tough it out\", \"you're being melodramatic\", \"just  google it\" was a common phrase if I had a problem and went to my  parents.  It got so bad that school officials were concerned and rightly  so but my parents had legal and financial clout so if anything was  tried they would threaten to counter sue the school/ individual and  looking back as an adult I realized how scarily close I was to becoming  another school shooter/psycho.\n\nWe never  really went on any vacations and what they were was usually along the  veins of \"driving 8 hours to another state where relatives who rarely  visited us were\" to where I would be forced to piss in water bottles and  I or my sister would be scolded for essentially being kids with bodily  functions.\n\nMy younger and only sister  saw and still sees me as a freak to be manipulated or broken whenever  she sees fit and was enabled to the point where as a teenager or 12-13  year old she could physically beat or attack me and I would be  physically intimidated by my father for sticking up for myself. Usually  he would bust open the door, throw or break some things, slap me, grab  me by the shirt and pin me to the wall with my feat dangling calling me a  \"future wife-beater, and to respect women\". The great irony is that my  mother was enabled by him and wound up cheating on him and secretly  doing Camshows.\n\nSo  with this little tidbit of personal information I am now an adult  living with my mother who's divorced the man she cheated with. I have a  job but my finances are in a wreck. My physical health has hit rock  bottom and developed minor anorexia due to me not eating due to stress  and anxiety. I dropped out of college after flunking spectacularly. I  still struggle with social skills but thanks to personal endurance and  trail and error. I have temper issues especially when it comes to money  and family. I have only dated twice in my life and both those  relationships were short-lived due to my anxiety, emotional state, and  circumstances.\n\nMy  sister has turned into white trash who works a dead end job doing  nothing but partying, drinking, and sitting on her ass watching netflix.  She is constantly belittling and insulting me or commanding me to do  something whenever I'm in her vicinity and my parents still enable her.  She has also dropped out of High School. Yet I'm the bad guy for having a  mental breakdown in college and realizing I need to do something else.  I'm still looking for what do for the future but doubt and fear still drive me away.\n\nThere is a lot more that I have not mentioned here though if enough interest is garnered then maybe I will.\n\nAll  I want at this point is to heal myself and move on with my life.  However the anger, bitterness, and worst of all proximity to my family  still hounds me every day to the point I feel like I need to completely  cut myself off from my family to feel any peace at all. But due to the  Aspergers and my own personal short-comings I am pretty much alone and  isolated save for them.\n\nHow  should I handle this? What could I do? I normally don't post on these  types of sites but I am at a loss. Thanks to all who reply and god bless  you.", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

She does completely rude and selfish things and then refuses to acknowledge or take blame. I get so upset that she can't see how she treats me that I break up with her. Then... she breaks down and apologizes for everything. Usually telling me how sweet I am and that she's sorry shes so difficult. I end up forgiving her and taking her back becuase I love her deeply. \n\nBut she says this is manipulation. And I see her perspective.

But I can see that if I don't leave for good it's cuz I didn't want to, and then it would be manipulation? \n\n\n2. Most of the time, our big fights are brought on by me. I call her out on how shitty she treats me. I often refuse to take blame for things I did not do or inte tions I did not have that she says I did. She then uses this as an excuse to not say sorry when she actually does really shitty things to me. \n\n3. I don't say sorry when she misconstrues my intentions, intentionally or not. I think it's her attempt to justify her shitty behavior. \n\n4. I really do think I treat her well.  But our relationship is so toxic it makes me sick. She says sometimes she wishes she never met me. I don't feel that way. I'm just sad i couldn't have shown her how much I really cared about her, as if it would make a difference. But I really don't think I'm a shitty bf. But if the relationship is this bad, and I'm still here, I must be getting something out of it. Like some narcissistic control thing?\n\n... Nah I think I'm codependent.

Always changing what he said weeks later making me seam crazy if i said no that isnt what you said. To giving silent treatments when i would disagree with him or correct him when he was wrong. To outright use my broken abused life i was raised in aginst me purposely triggering the horrible memorys of same past leaving me crippling depressed for days some times weeks.

The support from this sub has been so uplifting for me and I\u2019m so grateful. One of the major things I\u2019ve struggled and spoken about is how narcissistic my bf actually is and whether it\u2019s worth it to stay. This past week he\u2019s put me on an emotional rollercoaster from love bombs to ice cold apathy. Even for him it\u2019s been more than a regular flip flop of feelings and moods. \n\nSo today I decided to play a game. I just wanted to see if I could predict his behaviour based on my actions and reactions towards him. Because obviously, it\u2019s been a real struggle for me... especially lately. \n\nLong story short, we got in our first blowout fight in awhile last Friday. He tore me to shreds to a point where I was a puddle on my knees begging for forgiveness. All while he stood over me and called me pathetic as I cried at his feet. Why he started a fight out of nowhere when we were totally happy? I \u201cannoyed\u201d him. There was no explanation really, just that.\n\nThis fight was BAD. Probably the worst we\u2019ve had to date. By the end I was so emotionally exhausted I had to take a few days away from him. I\u2019ve never done this as I\u2019m kind of \u201cobsessed\u201d with my narc but I just needed to get away. While I was doing my own thing, he messaged me constantly asking how I was feeling telling me that he loved me and how much I meant to him... the whole 9 yards of love bombing. I caved and said it was fine and that I had forgiven him. And the second I did, he was all of a sudden cold and distant within instances. He came over yesterday and it was the first time I\u2019ve seen him since our fight. The coldness continued. When I asked him if he was okay and started to become insistent on attempting to figure him out he got really mean. I told him he was acting strange and he turned it around and said \u201cI was making him act this way... by asking too many questions\u201d then said I was \u201cbeginning to piss him off\u201d and if I didn\u2019t stop we\u2019d have a real issue like we just had a few days before. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t figured out what annoying and naggy is?\u201d Out of fear, I dropped it and we ended up going out for a bit. Our night was quiet and awkward. Every time I went in for a hug, kiss, anything... he\u2019d barely react or respond. It almost felt as if he was repulsed by me. And there I was longing for him. Throughout the night I was as sweet as could be and made any attempt to compliment, show love and comfort towards him and got shut down each and every time. After awhile I gave up and we both went to bed. We parted ways this morning to go to work said a half assed good bye and that was that.\n\nI\u2019m so sick of this shit. \n\nMid morning he messaged me and I decide not to answer. I knew if I \u201creacted\u201d he\u2019d read my text where I could see he read it and say nothing. So I didn\u2019t. Another message pops up in minutes reading \u201cI love you.\u201d Still didn\u2019t cave. Another 20 minutes later... \u201cyou must just be really busy... just making sure you know I love you.\u201d When I finally responded I didn\u2019t hear from him the rest of the day. \n\nI also noticed when he came by yesterday that he has no interest in what\u2019s going on in my life. I was talking about some minor drama going on in my sisters wedding that I am involved in for a few minutes until he intervened and said \u201cGod this is boring. No more wedding talk you\u2019re losing my attention... do you ever not complain about something? You\u2019re like the most negative person I\u2019ve ever met... just stop already.\u201d When I asked him about his day attempting to drop it he said \u201cNot in the mood to talk about anything cuz you put me in a bad place.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m starting to pick up that he\u2019s only interested in what\u2019s going on with me when it directly involves him or if he has to show  for some reason that he has the care in that moment or I\u2019ll be upset and leave. Only when he can selfishly benefit. When I finally spoke to him later today(which never happens I usually send him ten texts to get a response)he called me! never happens. I didn\u2019t talk about myself.. at all. He went on about his day and everything going on and for the first time in weeks he asked me how I was doing, asked how I was feeling because I\u2019ve been feeling sick lately with a cold and then even showed empathy. I gave him little or no details of my day or how I felt in any way physically, mentally or emotionally. And it\u2019s like he wanted more. The second I gave into the phone conversation and began talking of my day, he said he had to go and he was busy when I started finally talking about things.\n\nSo I guess my narc test worked?\n\nWhat I proved? Absolutely nothing except that he\u2019s kind of a soul-less piece of shit. \n\nI\u2019ve learned that a narc only wants what they can\u2019t have. They like the chase. They like to be driven. But once they pass the finish line they are bored. They want what benefits them and nothing else. And here I am, still thinking of the game I\u2019ll play tomorrow except I know I no longer want to play his game. \n\nI don\u2019t want revenge and I don\u2019t want to fuck with him like he\u2019s fucked with me. I wanted to prove to myself that he is what he is and I needed this as some kind of closure to let myself know that I\u2019m ready for the next step.....\n\nThe part where I debate whether I will stay and play games or I leave. And if I\u2019m leaving I want to be ready.., because I know the games will get harder and hurt more when I lose. \n\nI hope someone takes something from this like I did today.

Like he could see my whole screen. He can even get files of things I deleted. Like one time I was heading to the campus police and I was on the phone with my sister. He immediately called me and asked where I was going. I told him no where, and he asked if I was headed to his job (bc he works there as security). And he asked if I was on the phone. I freaked. But it clicked to me that he always hinted he saw my stuff. He jailbroke my phone and used the app tweakbox to do it. And my phone showed numerous signs that it was jailbroken. But why would he spy on me after the break up? When I asked him he obviously said no. And when I even saw on his phone my phone was connected some how as his devices. He denied it but I just took it off. And he completely flipped. He stopped being tough and hostile. He calmed down and looked sad? It was weird, creepy but I felt so bad for him.

Saying he wanted to help and he wanted to know more. I didn\u2019t know it was him at the time. I didn\u2019t even know he used reddit or that he knew I used it. But it was him because I saw his user name in his email once. I even know by how he was talking because it was weird, the \u201cperson\u201d was only asking questions. Nothing helpful.

I told them its okay and it would be cool if they gave me tips on how they manage school and study tips. They never messaged me again. And its weird how they told me they had to study because were both students!\nYeah, considering this I think I should take a break from the internet now lol.

His 11 yo daughter (AR) from a previous marriage has lived with us for about 5 years. Her mother has not been involved because a) she has/possibly still has a pill problem and b) the narc has created so much drama and difficulty for her to see AR. So I\u2019ve wanted a divorce for a while but didn\u2019t file because of AR. I cannot adopt her so technically I can\u2019t keep her. The divorce papers from narc\u2019s and baby mama\u2019s divorce give him primary conservatorship, BM has visitation but at his discretion. She can\u2019t reverse or change orders for less than $7k. BM isn\u2019t stable enough to take care of AR. Narc obviously isn\u2019t fit to raise her. I filed 3 weeks ago. He left after me threatening to get cops involved (which I\u2019ve had to twice in the last 3 weeks). Well he left AR too. \n\nI knew he would because he\u2019s too self-centered to take on parental responsibilities. I never thought he would get so outrageous toward his daughter. He\u2019s gone so far beyond anything I\u2019ve ever imagined with the mind games he\u2019s playing with AR. It started with asking her where she wanted to live. She said with me. He said ok but told her it\u2019d be like it was before where she would go weeks and months without seeing him. She was still adamant she wanted to stay with me. Then there were several days of fighting and drama with me. When I went NC, he went after her full-force. So bad, she even called him out and said he was only doing it to get to me. \n\nFriday, he came over within 15 minutes of her getting off the bus and made a big production about how he\u2019s getting a house and she would never see me or my family again because we\u2019re not real family. He threw a fit was losing his mind over something stupid so I called the cops. He left, came back, demanded AR leave with him, then brought her back within 30 minutes. He spent the rest of the night berating her on the phone with blaming shifting to me, gaslighting, guilt trips, anger etc. \n\nSaturday, he showed up unannounced. Demanded to see her just to say he was going to get her at 2. He didn\u2019t. He broke my Arlo on my front door. Flakes out on her, texted during dinner, tripped out on her bc she didn\u2019t have her phone, demanded she pack her stuff bc he was coming to get her in 15 minutes, didn\u2019t show, but berated her on the phone again all night. \n\nSunday, picked her up for less than 2 hours. \n\nMonday, 3 texts. \n\nTuesday and Wednesday, silent treatment. \n\nAnd for the grand freaking finale, today he takes her to dance 30 minutes away. She said he barely spoke to her and when he did he acted agitated. He spent the entire car ride talking on the phone trying to make AR jealous (her words). She text me asking if the town they were driving through was on the way back home. He caught her texting me (didn\u2019t realize this was a bad thing now) and apparently things went south. He started telling her how we broke his heart, he\u2019s so lost, and that after tonight, she was never seeing him again. \n\nThis is all in the last 6 days.

If I did the slightest thing wrong then I would get ignored and he would let me cry and have panic attacks, to the point where I was hurting myself by scratching up my arms and banging my head on things. He would just let me do it and be on his phone. Then a bit later he would pull me into his arms and say \"i love you, that's why I do it\".

He proceeded to yell at me and then ignore me for around 2 hours while I cried and begged and he made subtle hints that he might want to break up.

It was then that I realised, I was trying to make my new boyfriend into my ex. I was just so used to being treated like that. The only reason I realised it is because in the dream he said something I had only ever heard my ex say before. \"Why am I being so mean to the girl I'm going to f***?\" And then he laughed.

I had just moved and was lonely, met him where we both worked and he seemed to be so friendly and like he understood me. I feel stupid even now that I didn't see him for who he was. My ex was definetly abusive. Physically, emotionally, psychologically the most... He cheated on me, controlled me and ostracized me from my friends and family. He told me crazy things, tried to pretend he 'became' another version of himself and would completely change his mannerisms to match the 'other' self when he did. I don't know what I was thinking, why I went along with any of it, I guess by the time it got so bad I had it in my head that I couldn't get anyone better, didn't deserve anyone better. That he loved me and had some identity disorder or something and I had to prove that I loved him as he was. He set up tests for me to prove it and I complied, no matter how ridiculous or outrageous what he asked was. I honestly still hate myself for the things I did at his request. I never considered myself to be compliant or meek amd that is exactly what I was when I was with him.\n\nThe details here get blurry. I shoved so much of our relationship down, trying to forget all the pain he caused. There are still whole interactions between him and my family that I cannot remember, that they (my family) insist happened.\n\nWe had sex regularly. Anywhere he wanted to. One night though, we were at his place and things started like they usually did but he got rougher and 'changed' into 'someone else' making the same kind of reaction he would when he would say he was his 'other' self. I remember his hand at my neck, shoving me into the mattress and then nothing until after he was done. I didn't pass out, but I've blocked what happened in between. The sex started consenually and I never told him to stop but I was scared, I didn't know what to do or what he was doing. I froze. Afterwards he seemed to be 'himself' again and was telling me that a demon or something had taken his body and that it was trying to impregnante me to bring forward a new demon hybrid into the world. I don't remember alot of the conversation, mostly just feeling empty and confused about what had happened. I ended up getting away from him a week or so later but have carried all the pain with me since.

Sorry it's a long read, it could be longer but I didn't want to ramble on. I'm just fed up living around the negativity he passes out. \n\nI'm 24, I live at home with my mum and my brother (27). I would move if I was in the place to.\n\nMy brother has always been a bit controlling and manipulative. When I was 13/14 he used to tell that I'm not allowed to have a boyfriend and that I wasn't ever allowed to have sex, he would do this to the point where it would stress me out. He would get angry if he heard someone liked me. Could be passed off as a protective brother but it was just really weird and uncomfortable. When I was 16, me and his bandmate took interest in one another. My brother threatened his bandmate to stay away from me, while he was gloating about it one evening he said on along the lines of \"the amount of guys I've had to tell to stay away from you. I should knock your face around a little bit, mess it up a little, give you a broken nose\" he said it in a slight joking tone but there was some seriousness behind it. I left his presence because it was fucked up. He later came to the \"realisation\" that he stepped over the line and was very sorry. \n\nHe would make me feel like shit throughout my teens, calling me all the names under the sun if I didn't let him use my laptop - he was using it to watch porn. Acted me like having a laptop shown I was the favourite, him forgetting the fact he had PlayStation and gaming consoles. \n\nI had a lock put on my door because he would stand in my doorway at night, watching me. I don't know what he was doing, I had my back to him pretending to sleep, it was creepy.\n\nAt age 21, he aggression peaked. On his 21st birthday, he got drunk and attacked my mum. He screamed in her face, had her on the floor while she was holding a puppy, and bit my mum's head like some zombie. The police was called and he was sent to my grandparents. My mum brought him home the next day. Which she shouldn't have. After that the barriers were down and he had outbursts happened almost every week, screaming in her face and punching walls and doors. \n\nHe sits around pouting and glaring, giving himself a pity party over the most trivial things, he still starts arguments and acts all innocent. \n\nIf him and my mum have an argument he'll say stuff like \"why don't you ever have a go at Chicken\". Then passes that aggression onto me because I rarely argue with mum, saying \"I get off easy\". Nearly every time.\n\nHe says I'm to blame for any problem in the house. The internet having a sucky connection day? That's my fault. YouTube being a butt? That's my fault. He said him and his male witch friend agreed that I subconsciously affect things in the house. That I have mind control that I'm not in control of. It's just crazy bullshit to make me feel bad and to blame for shit. \n\nI'm 24 and he acts like he has a right to dictate how I spend my life. I go to work and college yet he'll still treat me like I'm sat at the house all day.\n\nHe was calling my nan an idiot, stupid and fucking moron with no hope because she didn't do exactly as he said. He gave her money for fence panels and told her which to buy and she \"undermined\" him by looking for cheaper ones. This was only a few days ago. He started bitching and moaning about me, getting himself all worked up because I stayed in the front room to look at cars on the computer while him and girlfriend slept on the sofa.\n\nMy family kind of let's him get away with everything he does, and I'm sick of it.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

If that's what this is.", "author": "Stabfacenotback", "self_text": "Quick background:\n\nWe split about a year ago.  Remained decent friends as co-workers and remain room mates until I figure out housing and splitting that asset.  Of course, no cooperation on his end.  Things deteriorated since Christmas season and the February 13th, he crossed the line of violent argument once again.  He had hit me with a door before after throwing down a plate of food and when I went into another locked room, he tried to break the door down.  He knew it was 100% over after this last argument and I would take legal action regarding our asset whether he liked it or not.\n\nThen, he (age 60), got diagnosed with prostate cancer.  I showed him compassion and empathy and support, but it didn't change anything in my mind.\n\nI think he thought the diagnosis would get me back, although he didn't try to be courteous, not even once.\n\nIn fact, he told me the cancer was no longer any of my concern.  I will call him A.\n\nThe present:\n\nHis disdain for me has risen.  Pretty sure his mind has him thinking I'm a heartless bitch to still be leaving him. His illness is in my heart, but I don't love him any more.\n\nWhen I told him I consulted a lawyer, I could tell he was having a hard time not going Ape Shit on me.  So I decided to change the subject and ask about his illness and where he was with the process of exact diagnosis.\n\nHe said, \"Yeah well, it's either it's the usual kind 60% of old guys have.  Or it's the bad kind.  My blood work came back with something.\"\n\nThe bad kind is 3% of men.  The bad kind presents with funky blood work and they do further testing.\n\nThen he said, \"Ya know, I don't even think I'm going to treat it.  I've lived a fun life.  I have no kids.  The treatment is worse than the cancer.  I don't care if I die of this.\"\n\nHe was stone-face serious.\n\nSo I shrugged and said, \"Well, that's too bad.  It's your decision.\"  And I left the room.\n\nYesterday, he left town and another co-worker came in to work for him unbeknownst to me.  That co-worker (M) pulled me aside with grave concern.\n\nM: \"How's A?\"\n\nI said (Me), \"I don't know, you'd have to ask him yourself.\"\n\nM:  I did!  He's so distraught over his diagnosis.  I told him to go see an oncologist, that's why I'm working for him!  He went down state for it.  It sounds pretty bad!\n\nMe:  Did he get more test results?\n\nM:  Something about high creatinine.  But then after that, A said his blood work was off and he got it retested two weeks ago.  Have you heard the results?  He hasn't said anything to me about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing in the fitness industry, I know that creatinine effects your kidneys and my first thought was that maybe the cancer already spread to his kidneys.\n\nM and I talked more and M told me that A said the cancer could be really bad and that K has lost a lot of weight. He told me A was really sad I would leave him now.\n\nWell, of course I was concerned about his health.  But this didn't add up to what A told me.  That he doesn't care.\n\nSo I googled a bunch of things.  There is a link between high creatinine and prostaste cancer.  There is no clear proof if one causes the other.  There is no clear proof that high creatinine is an indication of a higher morbidity rate.  The studies came short of saying coincidence but there has to be more.  Either way, they know there's a link and you best treat the reason behind the high creatinine.  I felt much better about his cancer diagnosis.\n\nSo I googled the causes of high creatinine.  Well, what do you know.  One of the causes is consuming too much protein and creatine.\n\nI've known K for 10 years.  When he was in his 20's, he was a competitive body builder and still trains like that to  this day.  Ever since I've known him, he goes through giant jars of protein powder, with additional creatine powder with additional creatine pills.  His diet is eggs, eggs, eggs, spinach, chicken, protein drinks and sports drinks with protein in them.  For years, we'd have to plan taking walks in the neighborhood around his consumption of protein shakes because they always made him pee.\n\nNo wonder he's lost weight!  He stopped consuming at least 1500 calories extra PER DAY!\n\nWell guess what you're supposed to do with a high creatinine level?  You stop that!\n\nNo wonder all the protein tubs are off the counter!  No wonder the mornings (4am because he opens the gym) have been silent!  (No blender noise).  No wonder our fridge is stuffed with beans and no spinach and no chicken!\n\nHe's been off the protein for about a month!  It's just now making sense to me why.  Because he KNOWS it's caused by his stupid diet.  He KNOWS it will make him look bad to admit it.  He also knows he told M about his creatinine level, but probably without doing his own research (he's dumb that way).\n\nSo now, it's probably a possibility that the \"off\" blood work is his new attempt at sympathy and attention.  It's possible he changed the terminology from high creatinine to \"blood work\" to keep the sympathy and concern on-going.  Certainly blood testing for cancer results would be in by now.  Yet, according to M, A is gone down state to an oncologist.  That's also where his best friends live.\n\nAnd today?  I got a FB reminder that today is his friend's birthday.  Certainly it's possible he got an appointment with an oncologist in two days, but more certainly, he's down there for a party with his buddies.\n\nHe emailed me about work, that I had to answer this morning.  I answered it and after I wrote, \"How was your doctor appointment?\"\n\nRadio silence.  He obviously knows M told me he was going to see a doctor.\n\nIf he lied to M, the fallout will be much worse than just lying to me.\n\nI do think it's a sick and sad and bizarro attempt to sway me back to him out of sympathy.\n\nOr?  I could be totally wrong and he's dying.\n\nWhich, maybe I am a cold hearted bitch.  But that would be just fine with me, too.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

He was abusive growing up, both mentally and physically. He was one of those parents that liked to brag about their child's success to other parents, and upon finding out other parents had kids that were more, academically successful then I, he would make sure to tell me, call me useless, worthless, and would never stop comparing me to other kids my whole life, even up until the day I moved out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOf course, sometimes words would not cut it.

For the record, my parents would fight a lot, and I mean, a lot. Mostly mental but there have been a decent amount of times where my father would hit my mother pretty bad and as someone who was only a kid at the time, my only thought was to just, keep quiet.

I remember the first time I stood up to my father, he was upset, in one of his rages, and he socked me right in the face, I ended up throwing a punch back that knocked him to the ground, since that day, hes never tried to attack me again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy family was also very religious, (despite me never being religious), I was forced to go the church, join a religious after school program for years, all that stuff, despite telling my parents numerous times I was not religious, of course, I stopped reminding them that, because everytime I told them It mostly lead to more abuse, and I was pretty much forced to partake in a lot of this crap, until the day I moved out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere was also a lot of trust issues in my family, if I said anything to both my mother or father in private, they would just blurt it out to other people, co-workers, family ect, despite how \"private\" the conversation was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, that's just some of the abuse that has happened in the past and a few like verbal abuse is still on-going through the few calls I have with them every now and then.

She's very high functioning, very pretty, thinks she's God's gift to the human race and can fall into a narcissistic rage like nothing you have ever seen.

I believe he has cheated on me but have never caught him red handed or found any \u201csmoking gun\u201d evidence to prove it. I have found text messages that are... off from an older woman he worked for who is a known home wrecker (I found that out after the fact). One said \u201cI want to hire you to come \u201cplay\u201d with me\u201d she went on to describe the work she wanted done on her deck but that line seems very inappropriate for a professional relationship. She also sent him a text talking about that days work and wrote this in the text \u201clet\u2019s establish up front that it\u2019s a perfect day to cuddle on the couch and watch old movies but let\u2019s fight the urge\u201d. He says the first was a play on words and the context was that she needed help with some curved window trim she couldn\u2019t get right and so he told her \u201cI\u2019ll have to come play with it to make it work\u201d and that\u2019s why she wrote she wanted to hire him to play with her.

Numerous times she mentioned how she wished my dog was there to play with her dog (I got the impression she wanted me to go get her cuz she looked at me every time she said this but I was working and so couldn\u2019t) and then after those attempts failed she literally told me to take a walk! At which point I reminded her I was working also. A few minutes later she whispered something to my narc (I was too far away to hear) which made him just about break his neck looking over his shoulder to make sure I didn\u2019t hear. From that moment on for the next hour she was there it was \u201cyour lovely wife this\u201d and \u201cyour beautiful family that\u201d and \u201cthe couple that works together stays together\u201d.

Now my narc swore uphill and down she never whispered anything to him for four months at which point he finally admitted it but gave me a BS story about what she said. The convo he claimed was whispered was one I was present for so I know he\u2019s lying. When this women was leaving after two hours she asked my narc if the work would be done that day because it was fine if he wanted to finish another day but I told her we would finish that day and there would be no need for him to come back. She completely ignored me, not even looking at me and repeated herself to my narc, and then I repeated my answer. Again she ignored me and repeated herself to my narc and I repeated myself to which she said to my narc \u201cwell if you change your mind you can always come back and finish\u201d. Now the reason I went with him that day was his behavior at home had changed, the old movies, suddenly he cared about his appearance, bedroom behavior changed, suddenly everything was \u201cnone of my business\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re not my wife\u201d ( we aren\u2019t married but this was 18 years in and one child later and he has referred to me as his wife in other settings). Something felt wrong and then I overheard a phone conversation between them that really bothered me. The volume on his phone was all the way up so I hear her perfectly. They were discussing the work that needed doing on her deck and they set up the day and time for it at which point he said it it should only take him four hours or so to which she responded \u201coh good! Then we will have the afternoon for...\u201d at which point he interrupted her telling her he would see her on the agreed day and then he hung up. He later claimed this was him setting a boundary something I had been asking for for year with other women! Though what boundary he thinks he established by interrupting her I haven\u2019t gotten any valid answer for. So that\u2019s why I went to work with him to see their interactions. I didn\u2019t like what I witnessed but I was already in the mindset that this was an affair. But why would she assume they would spend free time together if they had never done that before? He has no valid answer for that. Now after this day on her deck we got really fighting about this woman. He knew how I felt and yet when he would run into her after this he would continue to hug her. I didn\u2019t like it and said what happened to boundaries? He claimed he didn\u2019t want to be rude. Isn\u2019t interrupting someone also rude? I should also mention he has told me numerous times he thinks manners are a waste of time (when I complain about him never introducing me to women he knows  then manners are overrated and a waste of time!) Yet suddenly manners are important to him concerning her. He says it\u2019s because she was a client but he knew how I felt and he had already been rude in interrupting her so where are those boundaries he claimed he set then in the phone call? It all makes no sense! I confronted her and she denies it and of course so does he! Could he have just had a crush on her? She was much older than him (27 years!) so it\u2019s hard to wrap my head around that he would be attracted to her but he did call her \u201chot\u201d once. I should also mention he\u2019s always been careless of my feelings about other women. If I tell him I don\u2019t like certain behaviors (like hugging women he works alone with for 8 hours a day that I don\u2019t know, or getting shoulder massages (a different woman), not introducing me,etc) he does nothing to make me feel secure he tells me I\u2019m wrong in my feelings. Now his neglect through the years has led me to feel used and unloved so I\u2019m positive my jealousy is over the top, and they\u2019ve both denied it (albeit with excuses that don\u2019t quite add up for me but is it my jealousy not making them add up?) so I should trust him right? I should mention a condom went missing during this timeframe. I also came home one day and could have sworn my house smelled like sex and it wasn\u2019t from me and him. Our daughter was 15 at the time and in school that day and she denied taking the condom. Also during this time he did some work for this women\u2019s friend. I dropped him off to the friends house and a car was there I had never seen before and he said it was this woman\u2019s friends daughters car but it was not the same car the daughter had been driving, the daughter was on the trip with her mother and the car was gone when I picked him up. Two weeks later when we went to this women\u2019s house who I think he had something going on with that car was there! It was her new car because she had totaled her truck about a month prior. I have since gotten numerous different stories about whose car it is and was at the friends house. Yet it was obviously this woman\u2019s car! He claimed first he had no idea whose car it was. I didn\u2019t ask about the car when I saw it he just gave me the information about it being the daughters car unprovoked. In my mind that\u2019s a defensive statement because he felt guilty so he offered an excuse when none was asked for. So why tell me it was the daughters car if he had no idea? Then six different stories about the car followed and now it\u2019s a totally different color and make according to him! I just don\u2019t know what to do. I know he\u2019s been disrespectful and careless of my feelings concerning other women but does that make him a cheater? I know he\u2019s a liar (he\u2019s admitted he will say anything if he thinks it will benefit us) but does that make him a cheater? He could just be embarrassed about having a crush on a woman his mothers age. Do some narcs not cheat? Does he just get off on making me jealous? There\u2019s a billion more details of disrespect and some other occurrences with this women but these are the details I can\u2019t get past. I\u2019ve accused him numerous other times and now I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m the narc and abusing him with infidelity accusations without undeniable proof. Am I at least normal in questioning the interactions? Would anyone else be upset by those texts and their interactions? I\u2019m going crazy. I\u2019ve seriously lost my mind! Please help!  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that I always lift him up and pick up his slack in the areas where he has trouble doing what he should (working full time and helping domestically) yet he won\u2019t bend an inch to help me where I fail (trust). How hard is it to set boundaries with other women to give me peace of mind? It doesn\u2019t cost him anything yet he won\u2019t and he knows it hurts me when he doesn\u2019t! He would lose his mind if he found a text from a guy I spent hours alone working with that said \u201cI want to hire you to come play with me\u201d. Of course he won\u2019t admit it and says he doesn\u2019t know the context but he\u2019s lost it over far less (a guy on Xbox asked me what I was wearing and I replied a hoodie and jeans and he lost his mind telling me I was engaging and it was disrespectful even though I would never meet that guy in person and didn\u2019t even know his name!). I\u2019m just tired of the double standards! I\u2019m tired of this escalating because he won\u2019t admit to obvious things like not being okay with a guy texting me that. I\u2019m just so confused! Did he cheat? Did he not? Do some narcs not cheat? He is extremely smart and some things I\u2019ve read said intellectual narcs don\u2019t always cheat but has anyone else experienced this? I\u2019m tired of him playing the victim when I don\u2019t trust him because I don\u2019t think he engages in trust building behavior. He thinks I should automatically trust him because \u201che\u2019s never cheated\u201d! But how can I trust someone in the one area where all I have to go on is his word when he\u2019s consistently not kept his word in working full time and helping around the house? He acts like that\u2019s completely illogical to not trust him with other women because he doesn\u2019t do stuff around the house. Is it illogical? Should I automatically trust him with other women even if he doesn\u2019t meet his obligations or show me respect in all other areas of our relationship? \n\nIf you made it this far thank you! I know it\u2019s a jumbled mess and out of order and all over the place. It\u2019s my mind right now,  all messed up! Sorry! If you can make sense of it I\u2019d love your input. I\u2019m so tangled in his web of nonsense that I have no ability anymore to think logically. My logic is always shut down as \u201cwrong\u201d because according to him my conclusion is \u201cwrong\u201d. Can logic be correct even if the conclusion is wrong because you don\u2019t have all the facts? Did I destroy my family wrongly without hard proof? I\u2019ve kicked him out cuz cheating is one thing I won\u2019t put up with. I put up with the rest but cheating is it for me and I\u2019ve told him this all along. \n\n*sigh* so lost and broken", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

And when I say pretty I mean, drop dead gorgeous. Guys would always hit on her but she was really stuck up and only messed around with guys who through a lot of money around. \n\nWhen I went away for grad school, I just wanted to do new things...go out dancing, but drinks with dinner, go out to dinner, go to museums, meet new folks, etc. I thought our friendship was casual. She\u2019s a classmate and she thinks I\u2019m just \u201csoooo funny\u201d and the thing is I am funny and out going, I didn\u2019t think anything of it. \n\nWe had a weird dispute, and then did our project and it was fine. But she just was saying how I can\u2019t defend my position blah blah...and I stood my ground and said well we are all graded separately so it doesn\u2019t matter for you, this is my topic. I did well, our professor loved me, and she and I would talk for hours and always asked me my opinion in class. For this \u201cfriend\u201d I think I was competition.

Worthless.\" \"Stupid, you did it all wrong.\" The list goes on. He also has this weird thing to where, when we have visitors or other people, he becomes the most sociable thing. Also bragging about a lot of things. Acting charismatic, a whole other different person.\nHe has had a rough past, like losing his mother when he was 8 and enduring extreme abuse from his other family members. He has had a terrible childhood. I believe that this is the issue, the reason why he sees me, mother , and siblings as a threat, he's projecting his hate and abuse onto us.\n\nAs for my mother:\nShe is usually very mellow but at times kind of a sleeze? She sometimes listens and sometimes does not. Its always been like this for me when I was little, as much as I can remember. She always makes my emotions feel insignificant and invalid. Like , \"There is much worse out there, what I did to you is nothing\" kind of mentality. She isnt extreme as my dad, and I honestly think that my dad is holding her back. She doesnt like to be told that what she is doing could put her in trouble, like example from a while back: My two siblings (We will go with A and B) were fighting, my mother wasn't around, I had to calm them down, both were fighting over something small. I saw that B set off A and A was asking for B to stop. Only for B to be extremely rude about it. A became fed up. My mother came by and started to say cruel things to A because she thought she was mistreating B. I told her what really happened and she dismisses me like that. I told her \"Why wouldn't you believe me? I was there! I was settling both down, not you! You were not there! You didnt judge the situation appropriately!\" Then she tells me to shut up and that I am wrong. I kept telling her, \"This is not like you! This is why B is very rude to both of you and hits you! You were not there to see the whole thing. It is not like you!\" She immediately turns around and grabs a heavy soap box and with a burning hatred just throws it at me, hitting my shoulder and it bruised up.\nShe also dealt with a rough past, an abusive father and mother. She has 7 older brothers who were not abusive though. Though, she claims she has no ill will towards both parents. But most of it consists of how her mother would beat her for no reason. And sometimes place her hand on top of the burning stove top to get rid of her fear of getting burned. Her father, drunk, would beat her and her mother. Its to a point where I believe that the reason why her mother treated her different was perhaps that my mother was a \"rape baby\". She did mention that there were other men in her mothers life and she was most likely sexually abused by one of them. And my mother thinks that too. She also had to go through nearly getting abducted by sexual predators on the way to school (which its extremely scarring) and dealing with other women who would spread this rumour around of her, a 14 year old, going out with their crusty dusty old husbands. And my mother's mother would believe them and would beat her with a rod, where is to my mother kept denying everything and telling her that she would never do such a thing.\n\nAround 2014, my mother was cheating online with some other dudes (not actually meeting them up, but pretty much sexting them though), she was fed up with my dad and how he belittled her. My father found out and started calling her extreme vile insults. Like something that was not like him to say. It was like this for 2 months I believe. My father was trying to make me pick sides during the situation, same with my mother. I kept telling them that I still loved them, I think its better if yall can maybe talk about it and perhaps set up for divorce. But my father kept bringing up \"If we separate, I will never come back, you will never hear me again\". Even mentions of suicide. On my mothers side, she would care less. She understood what I told her. It came to a point where, my father kept saying \"Youre just like your mom, the same!.\" in the most negative and disgusted way. During that time, I was trying to get sibling B to come with me, but she was threatning me and everyone else with a knife, I just wanted the kids to not be around all of this, but she didnt let me take the youngest B with me. Later that time span, my father was verbally abusing my mother to the point she was on tears and begging him to stop. I stepped in and told him \"Quit it, you are not like that!\" He commanded me to put on a movie and to shut up. And I refused because he kept insulting her. He got up and pushed me extremely hard to the side to where I hurt my side into one of the tables. From here I don't know what came to me, but it felt like years of anger and sadness just burst, I lost it. I went up and fought back. He got up and started to punch me as well. He kept calling me \"So you think youre a man huh?! You lesbian!\" (Im not a lesbian, but most of the things I do is both equally feminine and masculine.) I felt a sense of control in those moments, but I went back to stop fighting because this isnt me, I wasnt like that. The adrenaline blocked all the pain. He kept bringing up his stupid Book God and saying that people like me will go to hell for laying a hand at my parents. He kept bringing up stupid bible verses as if it makes him in the right.\n\n\nAnother incident that happened months ago was that my father said something to my mother. He has this awful thing where he keeps picking at it and never ceases, as if he thrives in conflict or something. My mother got fed up with him and I dont remember much of the details  but it wound up to where my mother hit my dad with a gallon of hand sanitizer directly to his head. He was bleeding from his ear from the impact and got hand sanitizer directly in his eyes too. I also realized that he had small puncture wounds, my mother was trying to stab him while he was down. I honestly dont know what happened here because I wasnt around for the beginning, but when I was trying to settle the situation, she kept putting the blame on me out of nowhere. Sibling A was trying to settle her down, Sibling A told me that she looked like she was in a catatonic state, so try not to raise your voice or anything, she tells me. I had to tend my fathers wounds. It was to a point where he was sort of chuckling about it and being suspiciously mellow? I was angry at him. They don't realize, after all of that. They instilled extreme fear in all of us. To this day, I wake up in extreme fear. Like weird awful jumpy- hits in the gut.\n\n Just recently he ordered me to cook, and I told him, I am not sure what to cook, because we didnt have all the ingredients (and he was being vague on what he wanted). He started to yell at me and insult me saying, \"You cant do anything!\". I told him it was not needed for him to treat me that way, to not talk to me like that since I am doing what he is asking me to do. He thinks I was doing everything in a bad mood. I became quickly fed up and started to defend myself from the insults, for which it bothered him and started to threaten me with violence, \"I will punch your teeth right in, if you don't shut the fuck up!\" \"Ill beat the fuck out of you!\". He was yelling at me to get out of the kitchen. I told him I wasnt going anywhere because he is dealing with everything badly, to let me handle it. He grabs my forearm violently, his tight grip hurts me and throws me out with all his force. I yelled at him, \"What is wrong with you!? You are not like this!\" My adrenaline was getting the best of me, shaking and at the verge of crying because I know I cannot defend myself back. I did not want to relive that same situation back in 2014. Sibling B was there to see it all happen and he was scared. He was asking him to stop when my father was being awful.\nJust a while ago he asked for forgiveness, where he NEVER does that. He usually sees me or anybody else, unworthy of forgiveness or to be asked for forgiveness. No matter how wrong, cruel or hurtful he was. I know I should feel greatful that he said sorry, but it felt scary and off.\n\nI love my parents very much, I always gave up most of my friends invitations and other afterschool things so I can act as a babysitter for my siblings, yet I'm seen as a bother. I don't hate my parents. They have done good things for me as letting me stay, and basically care for me when I was a kid. I wanted to stay because I wanted to ease up all their weight, I wanted them to go out and enjoy what they couldnt have once in a while. Where is I could stay to care for my younger siblings. I dont think they see that from me. But I want to help them get better, I honestly think they have mental issues, but they deny it. I want to help them, because they arent like this internally. Im sure theyre acting on the past, heavily.\n\nMy current situation:\n&gt;I dont have a place to stay, not even around my friends since some are going through worse/also same situation.\n\n&gt;I dont have a liscense to drive. Though I know how to. But current two vehicles are of my parents, and they use it for their work.\n\n&gt;I do have an ID.\n\n&gt;I have a bank and paypal (thats where I do my freelancing)\n\n&gt;I don't know where to start for leaving... any ideas?", "subreddit": "abuse"}

There are some things I can tell myself were, for sure, not me being nuts. For example, there is unequivocal objective evidence of cheating and he admitted it in the end, though I'm fairly sure that it went on through most of our year and a half together. I also know that certain things he did were verbally abusive, like call me a bitch, fat (though I wasn't overweight but he knew it was an insecurity), tell me I had terrible skin, and that I was \"getting a hunchback like his mother.\" He waited until I was physically vulnerable to do these things. \n\nBut I'm still haunted by things that disturbed me and I can't tell if they were off. So here's one. He touted himself as a lover of animals and had two adopted dogs he claimed to love very much. I really bonded with one of them and it annoyed him that the dog became more responsive to me than him. Towards the end he would get the dog riled up from what looked to me to be normal playing and then lock him in a pitch dark stairwell and taunt him from the other side. I'd beg him to stop but he would say that I didn't understand their dynamic and laugh. I didn't grow up with dogs so don't know if there are any contexts in which this could be considered normal.

Wasn\u2019t sure what my ex husband was- people though bipolar, BPD but I am leaning towards narc after reading about the signs and reflecting on our 5 year relationship. First, it was love bombing hard. He told me I was perfect, he was going to marry me and if things didn\u2019t work out he\u2019d die alone because nobody was better. I felt like I had really won because how could someone as amazing as him love someone plain like me?\nAfter he proposed things changed a bit, he was moodier and less affectionate but after the wedding poof. He says I changed, but really it was him. He hated his job and took it out on me. If I was happy, he shit on it so I wasn\u2019t anymore. If I tried to focus on the positive he would be dismissive. Nothing I did was right.\nCue Oct a mere 2 months after our 1 year anniversary and him admitting to writing sex stories online with other girls and getting naked photos from them. Telling me he had failed me and he was so sorry.\nSilly me, I believed him. He put no effort into fixing trust, didn\u2019t tell me much more details than he waited until I was asleep and the cat served as a reminder I was there not me on the couch sleeping waiting for him to come to bed.\nValentine\u2019s Day he decided to make our place reek of cigarettes knowing I hated them and tell me he wanted a divorce because he didn\u2019t think he found me attractive anymore and I didn\u2019t make him happy at all. After 4.5 years of being the happy one, he beat it out of me emotionally.\nI\u2019ve been living at my dad\u2019s for 6 weeks now and not only has my anxiety gone down now that I\u2019m out- but I\u2019m at peace with my decision to be done. He told his friends and family I was desperate- who knew that trying to work on a marriage meant I was desperate. He said I was obsessed with him. Wow, glad you think so highly of yourself.\nHe was happy to tell me he had gone on a date (that went as poorly as he though it would) well have fun. I can say I put my heart and soul into trying to make the marriage work and kept my cool considering all he did was throw awful insults at me for weeks then say \u201cthis isn\u2019t at all what I wanted\u201d.

(?)\n* over and over again, he talked about, how i was making him feel bad. but he wasn't showing any love towards me. he never once tried to soothe me, console me, or be gentle/loving.\n* at times, it's like he turned into a different person. his facial expressions were totally different. mean, contorted. like an evil villain from a disney movie. i actually called him a monster (after he yelled at me and i was sobbing a lot). his face was so different. i kept repeating \"i don't know who you are\", and \"i want the kind, loving, gentle \\[name\\] back\".\n* i keep having an intrusive vision of, me going to visit him, and then he beats me. hits me. throws me against the wall, etc. and his roommate finally notices how bad he is, and saves me from him, and kicks him out. that someone finally witnesses what only i seem to see. because he's not like this with anybody else. not to my knowledge.\n* i'm scared. i'm despairing. just a couple hours ago i was having lovey dovey daydreams of us living together someday, with lots of cats, and a house full of love.\n* all i want is to give love, and to be loved. to create beautiful, meaningful memories, and to grow with another person who understands and supports me. someone who cares when i cry, and doesn't want me to be upset.\n* i didn't mean to hurt him, really i didn't.\n* he keeps saying a lot lately, \"i want to put myself first\". but in a relationship, aren't you supposed to consider the other person's feelings as well? for me, putting myself first, also means nourishing my relationship with the people i love, those who i consider important. he is one of those people. to me when he says he is putting himself first it really feels like he's saying he wants me to put him first (ahead of me). that, it's an excuse for him to be selfish, to push me away/avoid difficult conversations and my emotions.\n* i am on day 2 of my period so obviously, hormones are making me more raw, sensitive, etc. but i have otherwise, today, not been acting super abnormally or anything. \n* i did, however, get very anxious up to actually calling him for the \"tea date\". i was talking with my dad about something important and kind of rushed him off the phone, which i feel really bad about now. \n* we are technically only \"best friends\" and not a couple/dating. we were, but i asked for some space from him because i was going through a lot. but we have had phone s\\*x twice in the last few weeks. i was the one to initiate them both times because i want intimacy with him. this is a fact that makes me feel very ashamed. phone s\\*x is the only time when i feel that he's truly relaxed, there with me, desires me, loves me, wants to connect, etc. this is a fact that makes me feel really bad, because i don't know how to get him to connect in the same way/to feel that love from him unless i'm offering things that are s\\*xual. \n* last time we had phone s\\*x a couple days ago it lasted a while and after he finished he said he was \"sleepy\" and hung up. i also felt really weird and not good about it so i was okay with getting off the phone.

She constantly thought I was talking to women online &amp; checked my phone occasionally. However, she was very suspicious with her phone &amp; I reckon she was chatting to guys. She did show me one message where she has spoke to this guy who admitted that he liked cheating with married women. She would get into moods where she would stone wall me &amp; give me replies like \"cya\" \"what ever\" \"bye\" without telling me what was wrong. \n\nShe was really caring &amp; I loved her a lot but I couldn't take the constant break ups any more especially because they would normally follow with derogatory insults. She had called me fat, ugly grotesque &amp; she needed to be drunk to sleep with me. She didn't insult me often but when she did it was cruel &amp; it really knocked my confidence. She referred to me as been below her. When we broke up for the last time because she said she didn't love me no more, she tried hoovering me back in 5 times. She did say that she was contacting me because it was obvious once I realised I had made a mistake then I would be contacting her so she was doing the inevitable. \n\nShe posted something on Facebook saying I looked like a crack head &amp; her mother joined in saying she was too good for me. A few weeks later she emailed me telling me a close member of her family had a terminal illness &amp; she didn't know who else to speak to. I found this really hard to ignore but I knew I had to. \n\nThe reason for this post is because it has been suggested recently that maybe the break ups were because of her hormones &amp; bad periods. Maybe she had PMDD? She did suffer really badly &amp; said that she would get really depressed at that time of month. She had tried the birth control pill but it made her short of breath. I researched the problem for hours &amp; I urged her to go see a specialist but she wouldn't. She said the doctors couldn't help. I cannot be sure that all the breakups always happened at the time of the period but I know a lot of them did. \n\nI am now thinking maybe it was my fault for not been understanding although I did try my best to be.

We both lived near the end of the route so we were one of the last stops, so when it happened no one was sitting near us.

This particular day I wasnt feeling good, and I decided to shut my eyes and lean my head against the window for a little nap. She knew I wasnt feeling good. We were holding hands, when she suddenly lifted my hand and shoved it down her shirt forcing me to touch her breast. At this point in our relationship we had never done anything sexual. I was very confused at what was happening  and asked her \"Wait. What are you doing?\". Just as I was saying that her other hand reached over and grabbed my crotch. I told her to stop, and I wasnt feeling good and she stuck her hand down my gym shorts and started to jack me off. I was in a haze from me napping and confused as to what was happening I felt like I could barely say anything. I took everything for me to tell her again to stop and also focus on trying not to cum. I didnt want to scream or alert the bus driver because I thought I would get in big trouble, because I thought why would she believe that a girl was doing this to a guy. No one ever believes the guy when they said a girl raped or sexually assaulted them. Lucky for me when I came very close to cumming it was her stop and she got off the bus. I just sat there very confused at what just happened. A couple stops later was my stop and as soon as I got off the bus I threw up.

I need to get this all out. \n\nI met my ex husband in college, we were both non-traditional students. I was 25, he was 27, and we met on an archaeological dig over the summer of 2005. I had no feelings about him then, the only thing I remember about him from the dig was that he loudly complained to another male classmate about having to take orders from women (I asked him about this 9 months later, right when we started dating, and he brushed it off as a joke. I believed him because he was heavily involved in the gender studies department at the time...). So that was the first red flag that I ignored. \n\nMarch of 2006, after him pursuing me for about a month, I finally broke down and hung out with him. There were so many red flags. Our first date he didn\u2019t have any money, despite the fact that he worked and we both had student loans which paid out living expense money. He was waiting for money from his dad to come in the mail. I was too dumb to care, and thought that his \u201cworry\u201d over not being able to take me out was endearing. \n\nWithin 4 weeks of dating he started talking marriage! He would say things like \u201cI\u2019ve always said that I\u2019d never get married, but that was before I met you.\u201d It was so flattering at the time. I was swept off my feet. I was about to graduate and was uncertain about what to do with my life next. Around this time he started pressuring me to have anal sex with him, which is something I\u2019d never done and wasn\u2019t particularly interested in. I went along with it and I think it traumatized me. I remember going to campus afterwards and sitting in the bathroom shaking. I already had CPTSD and I think this solidified a trauma bond between us. \n\nWe got married in May 2006 after dating for 3 months. It was like I was on autopilot. After we were married all these little details slipped out that he hadn\u2019t mentioned: he had been diagnosed bipolar and was supposed to be on meds, he had been in AA when he started college at 26 but had dropped out right before pursuing me, he had had sexual relations with men in the past, he had been to rehab as a teenager for cocaine use. I was an innocent person and wasn\u2019t ready for any of this, but I tried to take it in stride and make the best of my marriage. I stupidly thought we were in love and love would conquer all.\n\nThen a debt collector showed up to our apartment to serve him papers. He was past due $6000 on a credit card and had no way to pay it. I think he married me because he thought I had more family money than I did, and that I/my family would step in and pay it off for him. Nowadays I like to imagine how bummed he must have been when that wasn\u2019t the case. \n\nHe applied to the same graduate programs that I was interested in and we both were accepted to the same school in a new city. For some reason the move was incredibly harrowing, like his approach to moving house was acting like we had to do it as quickly as possible without any help. Looking back, he behaved during the move the way he did while on Adderall or cocaine, but I was too naive back then to have any idea. \n\nThe first time he gave me the silent treatment, I was shocked and scared. I had interrupted him while he was telling his brother and brother\u2019s gf a story in a bar to interject something, and suddenly he went silent and wouldn\u2019t make eye contact with me. This continued all the way back to where we were spending the night. He just kept drinking once we were alone, and ignoring me and I had to get on my knees and literally beg him to forgive me. He accepted my apology and then like... forced me to go down on him and then grabbed my hair pulled it hard and raped (?) me to show me who was boss. \n\nAfter 6 months of marriage he started drinking every single night. When I confronted him about it he had a complete meltdown and accused me of regretting marrying him. Once he left me standing in the middle of a parking lot in a bad neighborhood so that he could go in and get some beer (I don\u2019t remember why he said I couldn\u2019t come inside with him, but now I think he was probably buying drugs too). Then he got super trashed on Thanksgiving and when I became upset/distraught he threatened to harm himself with a razor (but didn\u2019t, he never did... but funny enough I started to harm myself after a while!). Then about a few weeks later, out of nowhere while I was studying, he angrily confronted me and accused me of \u201cruining his Thanksgiving\u201d with my bitchiness. I was blindsided and basically told him a list of all the bullshit he put me through over the 6 months of our marriage. He got all sad/shocked and told me that I had to leave him. My dumb ass felt sorry for him and totally fell for his contrite act. This argument ended with ME starting therapy and him claiming that he would go back to AA. \n\nHe supposedly started going to these early morning AA meetings across town, but every time he would go he was gone for a long time, much longer than needed for a meeting. One time he made a small side comment to me about how he drove past so many prostitutes on the way to the meetings, and now I really think that\u2019s what he was up to and why he was gone for so long. He would often do this to people: give them a small hint about something he was doing that he knew he wasn\u2019t supposed to be. I think it gave him a thrill to almost admit to something but not be caught. I wish I could think of other examples now. \n\nSomething weird that happened during this time is that a random undergrad on campus got fixated on me and started cornering me at the gym. This part is kind of a blur for me. I told my husband that he was stalking me, because that\u2019s how it felt?? Looking back I don\u2019t know why I blew things so far out of proportion, I think I was actually afraid of my husband but I projected my fears onto this guy. I took it so far as to file a police report/protection order and tried (successfully) to get him kicked off campus. The only thing he\u2019d done was have the nerve to speak to me while I was trying to use the exercise bike a couple of times. I feel like my husband egged me on with prosecuting him.... I guess? Or was it all me? I was so confused at this point. I should have been focusing my anger on my husband but instead I took it out on this poor weirdo. I mean, it did turn out that he had put his hands on an underage girl who was visiting campus as well, but it wasn\u2019t really my fight and he never touched me. \n\nWe never talked about the stalking incident again after it was over, but we moved back to our original town and commuted to grad school instead of living on campus like we had been. This was the first part of 2007. He gradually eased away from AA and started drinking again. We were living with my narc mom and the two of them hit it off fabulously, he would chat with her while I was off doing other stuff and she told him EVERYTHING about my life (past loves, childhood issues, etc)... things that he would later use against me. She enabled his drinking whenever she got the chance. \n\nWe went to NYC for spring break that year and I started having these random crying jags. I had started taking cymbalta for my \u201cdepression\u201d which was really just sadness and fear due to my situation. When I would cry he would become enraged and scream at me that my meds weren\u2019t \u201cworking.\u201d I don\u2019t remember much about this trip except for the feeling of crying all the time, and one evening when he decided that he wanted some really rough sex and hurt me. I remember sitting in the bathtub afterwards listening to Cat Power, not knowing what to do. We decided to get a dog when we got back home. \n\nAfter the semester ended, he got a part time job at a bagel place and started buying weed and Adderall from one of his coworkers. The first time he brought the weed home, he lied and told me that he found it on the ground behind the bagel place and that some drug dealer probably dropped it in a panic. I believed him because I was still dumb and naive as hell. The Adderall made him so much worse. One day he told me that he was going to start seeing a therapist because he, quote, couldn\u2019t stop fantasizing about raping me. That when he saw me walking around on campus he just wanted to push me down and rape me, he wanted to choke me during sex, etc. I didn\u2019t know how to react, I was terrified. \n\nHe found a female therapist on campus and apparently the two of them talked about ME every session - he would come home and tell me that his therapist says that my depression is self-induced, and even that she says I probably didn\u2019t contract the HPV that I suddenly had from him, and that I could have gotten it anywhere.... wtf!!! \n\nSo I was living in constant fear that I was trying to ignore. He started choking me during sex (therapist approved, supposedly) and I felt like a had to put up with it because otherwise I was a \u201cprude.\u201d We moved out of my mom\u2019s house into our own place and the abuse got worse. He started regularly taking enough Adderall to stay up for 3 days straight, and he would  look at violent and disgusting pornography all night long. He would wake me up and force me to watch his favorite scenes with him. Everything was about sex at that point. He would write these sex stories that starred all of my friends and coworkers, just sexualizing everyone in my life. He would draw pictures of me being gang raped and proudly show them to me. For Easter 2008 he got me an Easter basket filled with porn videos, handcuffs and bondage rope. I was not and am not a kinky person! \n\nOne day he was driving us somewhere and he started frantically talking about how I needed to leave him and go be with a woman because I was obviously a closeted lesbian...??? I don\u2019t know where he got this from but for some reason it was suddenly urgent. I\u2019ve never been with another woman, but he had been with men in his past. Looking back, I think he was telling me this because he had cheated on me with a guy and was projecting. \n\nSummer 2008 we went on a cruise with his family and it was an absolute nightmare for me. I\u2019ve never felt so trapped. He stumbled into our cabin one night super drink and high on Adderall and demanded that I have violent sex with him. For the first time, he slapped me across the face repeatedly while raping me. He called me horrible names and told me he was going to take my clothes and drop me off in an alleyway naked. He threatened to cut my face with a knife. \n\nWhen we returned from the cruise, I kept experiencing shortness of breath. Turns out I was having panic attacks, so they just upped my medication like nothing else was wrong. He demanded to know why I couldn\u2019t be a fun, outgoing person like his cousin from the cruise...???\n\nSpring 2009 we were applying to PhD programs together and took a spring break trip to Mexico with our graduate program. My mental health was definitely getting worse, and I was having a lot of trouble focusing on the scholarly aspects of the trip. At this point I was in survival mode. I don\u2019t think he brought enough Adderall on the trip to keep his addiction happy and he had terrible moodswings the whole time. He would, every month, use up all of the Adderall before his next script would be filled and would spend 5 days in bed \u201csick\u201d (really too exhausted to function). By the end of this trip he was \u201csick\u201d and had to spend a few days laying around hotel rooms. One night I asked him for affection and he beat me up and raped me with our professor and other students in the next rooms.\n\nWe were together for 6 more years after that but I can\u2019t write anymore today and will have to do a part 2. This stuff is hard for me to share because of how naive and passive I was. My life is 1000% better since I left him in 2015, but I lost 9 years of myself to this asshole. After the Mexico trip it became clear to him that I was breaking down from his abuse and so he went on a campaign of trying to convince me that I was the one who initiated the rough sex and that I wanted it. He told me that I couldn\u2019t be abused because I wasn\u2019t innocent. He was an absolute monster. \n\nFor part 2 I will have to include:\n\nHow in December 2009 he manipulated me by telling me about his childhood abuse when I caught him red-handed cheating. How he turned the entire graduate department against us in 2010. How my narc mom took him in after I kicked him out in 2011. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

However, tonight he said he was taking me on a proper date for once, where he paid.\n\nSo we were at this sit down restaurant where there was a TV in the corner playing basketball. I was excited about finally having a real date, over a year into our relationship, but he was stone cold. Expressionless. Only paying attention to the tv. Any attempts I made at conversation were either flat out ignored or answered bluntly. \nI tried desperately to snuggle up against his shoulder or at least hold his hand. Something. I just wanted to touch him and be shown affection for once. \nHe did not reciprocate any of it. In fact, when I leaned against his shoulder he didn't even relax to make it more comfortable for me. So I was sitting there with my head at an awkward angle, trying my hardest to get some glimpse of what a real relationship is like, trying so hard to have a good time with him for once. \nNothing. I would've felt more loved if I cuddled up against a brick wall. \n\nLooking back, in his mind he was probably punishing me for daring to allow him to buy a meal when he was the real one \"struggling\". Or something that made it all my fault. But of course, at the time, all I could think was \"wow even my boyfriend doesn't want to touch me.'\n\nThis is not what love is. I have never had a real, comfortable, loving relationship, but I know that it's not supposed to look or feel anything like that. \nIf I ever fall in love for real, my man is not going to want to take his hands off of me. He will not mock me for wanting to cuddle and I will not have to fight to even get a hug out of him. \n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

It was planned but unplanned. While I was at work, I was in constant contact with family, coming up with an exit strategy. And then my shift ended and I realized that I couldn\u2019t go home. \n\nI was terrified. I had left everything at the house - birth certificate, passport. He had all the bank cards. I had nothing but the clothes on my back. I was terrified as I checked into the hotel - like he somehow knew I was there and was going to burst into the lobby any minute. As if he could read my damn mind. Years of mind games will do that to you. \n\nI thought I would have more to say on the matter, or at least a long diatribe of how great I feel now and how amazing everything is. And, truth be told, everything is going really well. I\u2019m doing great at a new job. I\u2019m living alone in the city, like I always wanted to. My house is clean and quiet and filled with only things I like. \n\nI still struggle emotionally. The wounds don\u2019t heal overnight, like I wanted them to. Honestly I thought the hardest thing I had to do was to get rid of him and I\u2019d be back to normal. But that\u2019s not true. The hardest part in all of this was to face myself, to step out of learned helplessness. To stop being the victim. To learn to actually like myself. To be content alone. I\u2019m not 100% there yet, maybe around 70% there. \n\nTherapy is a huge help. Setting routines - having set times for basic things such as making the bed, washing my face, etc. Learning to meditate, reading books and blogs on codependency and narcissistic abuse. What\u2019s helped the most is just...being alone with myself and my emotions. Letting myself feel. I spent so many years in denial that once the drama of the breakup passed, it was just me and a locked up box of repressed feelings. I cried everyday for many reasons, or sometimes just no reason at all. \n\nI don't forgive him. I don\u2019t think I ever will. I don\u2019t believe that I have to in order to move forward. He spent a good month trying to get a hold of me, to the point of harassing my parents and friends. I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s doing - I don\u2019t really care. I never want to see him again.\n\nAm I happy? I\u2019d say, I\u2019m more at peace. I no longer go through the extremes of emotions that I had with him. I\u2019m slowly growing into this new version of myself - getting some of my old hobbies back while finding new ones. I\u2019m getting to know myself, finding my voice. Trusting myself again. \n\nIt was hell, y\u2019all. Life with him was fucking hell. I\u2019d rather go through the ups and downs of this year all over again than to spend one more fucking day in that house. \n\nI wish I had something more uplifting to say \u2014 maybe I will when I hit the two year mark. It\u2019s a process, getting out of the fog. If I had any advice to give, it would be to trust the process. Let yourself feel.\n\nThe most important advice I could give is to go no contact. Stay no contact. Whether it\u2019s a year from the breakup or ten years. There\u2019s no closure with these people. You don\u2019t need closure. You need to feel safe, secure and loved. You can give yourself these things - you don\u2019t need them to give it to you. There\u2019s no safety with a narc. There\u2019s no security. There\u2019s no love. \n\nGet out. Stay out. Look up Shahida Arabi and read her articles on narcissistic abuse. Read the book Codependent No More. Those two books changed my way of thinking, about him and about myself. \n\nAnyways, thanks for reading my ramble of an update. Huge thanks to the mods for running this sub. Having a space to vent with those who understand the pain helped me get through everything and kept me NC with nex. \n\n\nHave a good weekend guys. \u2764\ufe0f", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I've seen signs of immaturity in and self-absorption in her, but overall she's been fun to hang out with.  A few months ago, I  told her my eldest son (an adult) had a polyp removed and was awaiting a biopsy &amp; that we were both concerned. She did not ask questions or discuss it at the time, from what I remember. \n\nA week or two later, the \"friend\" called to say she had wrapped up the project (I congratulated her) and wondered when she'd get paid. Therein ensued a long series of questions from her asking when they paid (I had no idea &amp; told her), comments that her \"other\" place where she worked paid differently, asking me again about payment and asking why they didn't process the same as her other place (she knows I have nothing to do with accounting &amp; I kept repeating I didn't know). Despite all that, she then asked MORE questions, and gave more comparisons such as, \"But to the other place pays faster, why doesn't this place?\" etc. \n\nFinally, I could not take it any longer and I snapped: \"I told you, I don't KNOW the answers to that. I really can't talk about this now. My son has cancer, and I am dealing with that.\" \n\nShe said, in a voice that was literally whiny, \"I don't know how to *help* you.\" (???).  No questions, and no sympathy, and no apology while on the phone. \n\nI replied, \"I did not ASK for help. I am happy for you that the other place pays (differently, faster, whatever), but this isn't the same place, and I don't know when they process paymenst. I need to hang up now.\" \n\nShe then texted she was sorry if she said the wrong thing, and \"didn't know what I was going through\" (despite knowing we were waiting for a biopsy, which she did not even mention before launching into the questions). I texted back I was aware of that, but could not handle repeated questions asking why Place #1 does not do things the way Place #2 does, when I don't know the answers. A while afterward, I texted to congratulate her on the successful project, but have not heard from her. She did not ask how my son was. \n\nShe has never had children and mostly talks about shopping, fashion, her dog and her house. Not once has she asked how things are going or asked anything about my son. When she called to whine about the timing of the payment, she did not ask if we knew about the biopsy yet.  Other friends of mine who knew the situation asked about it as we waited, and have continued to ask how things are going. \n\nWhat am I dealing with? Should I have handled it differently? I realize I snapped when it got to be too much, but my feeling in remembering the whole thing as well as other things she's done makes me feel this person is possibly a narcissist, and has a limited range of empathy or concern for others. Or something. \n\nThanks for any advice, or support, or constructive feedback. It feels good just to vent a bit. \n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I fell in love with him the first time when I was 17 and he was 19. We dated for four years, it was not a good relationship, I don\u2019t ever remember feeling safe or cherished. It blew up one too many times and I ran away to a far away country. After 23 years I returned to our hometown with my children in tow after my husband and I separated. The same month The Scorpion lost his business, had his car repossessed, was evicted from his home - and our daughters were placed next to each other in their maths class at school - and became best friends.\n\nThroughout our young relationship he was less than stellar. He didnt take the night off work to take me to my final year ball, he met me there, I have no photos of us there together. Only group photos where I am a spare and I remember feeling disappointed. Whenever I walked in to a room when we were going somewhere fancy he would ask \u201chow do I look?\u201d and never compliment me. I lost my virginity to him a week before my 18th birthday. One week later - on my the night before my birthday he was at a party with a model on his arm and cruelly and pointedly ignoring me. We broke up again. He was wouldn't leave me alone, he intercepted my mail. A terminally ill mutual friend of ours who had a crush on me wrote me a letter. He read it out in front of me while sitting locked in his car in the front of my house and mocked the guy for liking me. I cannot believe the shit I accepted.\n\nWe would have periods of calm and intense passion after which he would leave me for other women and then later claim \u201cwe were on a break\u201d I have since worked out that he would have initiated the breaks to coincide with the hook ups he had already put in place.\n\nThis explains the out of the blue aspects I remember of these break ups. Of course, these would destroy me, I would suffer terribly and then he would come back. Knock at my door and claim that \u201cthat was a mistake\u201d he realised he loved me and please could we try again. Of course we could. Until the next time. This probably happened 4 or 5 times over the relationship. I was young and dumb and had no idea what I was dealing with.\n\nI tried to break free and found someone else I liked and tried to date while we were broken up and The Scorpion was out of the country. He came back from his trip early. He would watch me through the window of the new guys sitting room, come over to his house and knock on the door saying that he knew I was in there and if the new guy opened the door that he would hit him. That relationship failed and I somehow went back again for more.\n\nOnce again we were on a break I didnt know about and I saw him drive past my house one night with a girl I recognised  in the car. When I eventually confronted him he said \u201cI\u2019ve never been in love like this before\u201d It crushed me but despite his love for her he came to me later that night after he crashed his car. I told him to leave, but he managed to talk me around and stayed the night in my arms. The next morning he left saying \"don\u2019t tell Anna\" and walked off without even looking back. I was broken, I knew I couldn't take anymore of his shitty treatment. I left the country 2 weeks later - despite his overwhelming love for Anna they didnt last long and I didn't return for 23 years.\n\nHe got in contact with me on Facebook when his marriage was breaking down about 10 years later. We talked on the phone and emailed and chatted. All friendly, I would see him when I came back to our home town to visit every year. A drink or a coffee, sometimes dinner to catch up. Low level contact - irregular - more when he wasnt seeing anyone one and tapering off when he was. This went on for another 11 years, until I returned to the town we grew up in and our girls became friends.\n\nWe started to spend a lot of time together, A LOT of time together. With the kids and without. He is embroiled in an incredibly toxic and bitter custody battle with his ex wife whom he has a restraining order on, his son refuses to see him. His fiancee left him a couple of months into our renewed friendship, taking their 11 month old with her and we started spending A LOT MORE time together. Mostly me listening to his problems, he shared everything with me, texts and letters and conversations with the the ex-wife and his ex fiancee. I listened and advised. He pretended to be depressed and even suicidal. To my credit I never really bought that but I didnt like to play around with it and accuse him of faking it just in case he wasn\u2019t.\n\nWe have basically developed an illegitimate relationship that masquerades as a friendship. It never really takes off. It is inconsistent and messy and painful and full of his special brand of mindfuckery. But we are basically all the other has. He doesnt have many friends and neither do I. I haven't really made any new ones since I have been back, I have spent all my time with him.\n\nJust recently, he dropped into the conversation he didnt know that I had lost my virginity to him. He thought I had already slept with with the guy who introduced us. This is a lie. I know he knew. I remember the night, the conversations. I know we discussed it and there was allusion to it over the years. He knew\u2026I don\u2019t know why he now claims \u201che forgot\u201d it is hurtful.\n\nOnce I brought up the abortion I had when we were together when we were young, for which he was at another girls playing poker the night before. (I needed my young head read)  He told me that he had \u201cpretty much got all of his girlfriends pregnant\u201d and that he hadn\u2019t even thought that our daughters could have shared an older sibling. Just shitty shit and no need to say something like that. Even if you think it.\n\nI am currently being ignored again - I think it was because I was in a poor reception area on the phone and he couldn't hear me. Im serious! and still....despite my brain knowing what an asshat he is my heart is  broken again. It is unfathomable how he affects me and how I cannot let him go. So I am posting here to put it out there. I cannot keep it all in my head anymore, there us just too much noise, confusion and sadness.....", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I unfortunately indulged, but was super cautious. He again was showing a lot of interest and was flirting and was more attentive and communicative then he ever was before.

I still am I guess..\n\nMy father isn\u2019t very abusive but he has his moments of yelling.

He went off on me like I\u2019ve never seen him do before and it took me right back to my past relationships where I would be in constant fear of being hit. I didn\u2019t know what to do. After he calmed down and everything he apologized and ask if I was okay. I lied and told him I was. \n\nI was far from okay, I for the first time in our entire relationship with him, friendship then dating, I am afraid of him.

Over the course of the relationship there has been spectacular battles I never imagined I\u2019d have in a relationship. I have had long term relationships before this where I would rarely fight with my partner so I understand what a relatively healthy relationship is like.\nToday I finally told my boyfriend I needed to be away to process and figure out whether this relationship could be saved. I am now at my parents\u2019 house a few hours away. \nThe night prior to this I had a friend come over to sit between us so things wouldnt escalate, it seemed to be pretty effective in keeping the situation calm. Just the last week we had a fight and it ended with me locking myself in the bathroom while he threw things and tore down the blinds. I don\u2019t think he is a monster, I just feel exhausted emotionally by being with him.\nOver the course of the last two years I have been pushed, had water thrown in my face, had items of mine broken by throwing things, had him scream bloody rage in my face calling me a cunt or a bitch, sometimes daily. It seemed like when he wasn\u2019t having sex enough I would be made to feel something was wrong with me for not wanting it all the time (we would have sex a few times a week already). I have been choked on rare occasions and verbally humiliated in public frequently to the shock of people around me.\nI didn\u2019t realize how accustomed to the behavior I had become until I accidentally broke the screen on his iPad a month ago and (he found out right after eating in a restaurant with our mutual friend) he started yelling at me and pulling at his hair and making an insane scene, calling me a bitch. Our friend was super alarmed, but more alarmed when he stormed off and she realized I saw this as normal and told her he would shake it off eventually.\nWhen he is not in a bad mood he is really lovely to me, he is smart and funny and we have a ton of interests in common, but the roller coaster is just exhausting, and I really feel like I\u2019ve been trying so hard to make him happy at my expense and I\u2019m losing myself in the process.\nApart from this he has cheated on me multiple times, even going so far to send a sexual picture of me to another girl he was sexting unbeknownst to me. When I found these texts he told me it was because he was trying to set up a threesome (something we have done in the past but I have really been avoiding) When I realized he was never going to be faithful, I told him I was open to his suggestion to having an open relationship. He seemed okay with this other than the part where I sleep with other guys. This week he decided that it was fair (since I was harboring a lot of resentment over being the only monogamous one in this relationship) if I could go on a date with a guy that had asked me out. I spent the night before going over all of the things I could do to make sure this was going to be respectful towards him and both of us going forward. \nSo I go on the date, and the guy is way more gorgeous than I remembered and he was an absolute gentleman to me, very polite and respectful of boundaries. These things wouldn\u2019t be so evident to me if I hadn\u2019t been experiencing the exact opposite on a daily basis.  We end up having insane sex like I haven\u2019t had in two years, and I realize it\u2019s so different because my boyfriend doesn\u2019t reciprocate sexually and is half interested in whether I get off or not. I literally always have to ask him. I frequently give in to having sex with him because I know otherwise he is going to start fights with me and be in a terrible mood all day. After we had sex earlier this week I just cried. It has just become work for me so I can be sane living in the same space as him.\nI know I\u2019m brushing over a lot of this, there are many good experiences I\u2019ve had with him as well! I\u2019m feeling like part of me wants to go to therapy to fix this, but the larger part of me wants to just get as far away from this dysfunctional relationship as possible. Am I crazy for having a tiny hope that this could all be fixed or am I better off alone? Sorry for the long story about this bizarre relationship. I have really thrown my whole heart into this man because we have so much in common, but I feel I am normalizing a dysfunctional, abusive relationship. ", "subreddit": "emotionalabuse"}

Of course when I called him to tell him, he immediately burst into hysterics, yelling about how there's no reason he should have it. Yeah, yeah.\n\nI actually gave him a ride to Planned Parenthood. Part of me was still considering whether I could've been the one to get it, even though I used a condom with the ONE other person I had sex with that year. Part of me was honestly convinced by his little performance on the phone, and knowing that the outcome would be horrendous if I admitted to cheating on him, I decided. I also think I was just too weak, tired, in pain, and terrified of infertility to even give a shit about whether he cheated or not.\n\nSpeaking of my fear of infertility, when I first found out I tested positive, it had been a month since I got tested. So for at least one whole month, I had chlamydia thrashing around in my reproductive organs. I was celibate for weeks after the chlamydia diagnosis, except for one protected partner. However, when I tested again a month later, my chlamydia result was positive again. (They didn't give me the shot the first time I was treated, just the pill.) So that's at least a few months that I know I had chlamydia.\n\nBUT WAIT, there's more! Last night I was stressing about it (yes, still hypersensitive about everything going on with my body and still terrified of infertility regardless of being treated. on some real shit guys i am so fucking scared and alone in this STD nightmare) and somehow I ended up on the Planned Parenthood website, looking at my STD results over the years.\n\nThat's when my stomach dropped. I tested positive in October of 2018. But before that STD test, I hadn't been tested since January of 2017. My nex and I got together in August of 2017.\n\nLooking at the notes in my period tracking app, I was having uncomfortable and strange symptoms as early as February of 2018. God knows how long I had that fucking disease in my fragile reproductive organs. God fucking dammit. I will never forgive myself for that.\n\nI used to be strict about getting tested after EACH and EVERY new partner. I have no idea what happened that made me forget that very strong personal rule of mine, but for some reason I just trusted that my Nex was telling the truth. Even though it got to the point where he flat out refused to wear condoms because \"if I wanted to prevent a pregnancy so badly I'd just take birth control\". I honestly didn't even think of STDs because I'm just that stupid and naive.\n\nMoral of the story is, I was so wrapped up and entranced by his chaotic abusive cycles that I forgot to even check up on myself and make sure I was healthy. If it turns out that I became infertile for having that fucking disease for so long, I will truly never forgive myself.\n\nWhy me.", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I haven\u2019t told anyone but I really want to get it out. Right now I am 23 years old, I live on my own with my boyfriend of 2 years. I was raised by a single mother, she had me at 16. I am the oldest of 2 other half brothers. I really like to keep my distance from my mom because I feel like she hates me. She has never protected me from any abuse, and a lot of times in my life I felt like she loved my abusers more than she loved me. My mom didn\u2019t have a good mother herself, but still she could\u2019ve made a change. \n\nI was first molested by a step sibling when I was 9, but my virginity was taken shortly before I started the 6th grade. I remembered laying there by myself, feeling ashamed. Feeling like I had no one to run to. After that, he would abuse me everyday. When he got caught in my room, I got treated like I was the terrible one. I got a severe beating from his Dad, so did he. As my mom watched and did nothing. She never even came to my side and asked me if I was okay or if he touched me. Nothing at all. Not even soon after, my stepdad started molesting me. I never in a million years thought that he would do such a thing, but he did. I finally told her about it when I was 15...we moved, he went to jail, that was it. She never offered me therapy or asked if I was okay or anything. We talked about it one day. Yet, she still wrote him in prison. I would see those letters in our living room every week. How could you love me, yet proceed to write my rapist? I never could understand it. When I came to her about it, all she told me was \u201cWell, he has no one right now.\u201d Wow...well where does that leave me? I am an adult yet I still feel disgusted. I still feel wrong. I don\u2019t like to think about my childhood because I try to love my mom for her shortcomings, but yet I don\u2019t feel like she loves me enough or at all. It took me crying and asking her to never have those letters ever step foot in the house in order for her to stop. It did...for a while. I saw more letters a year or so later. When I got older I felt like she always resented me. Even as an adult. I was a good kid, I made great grades, I did a good job trying to be the perfect kid but it was never enough. I always had to be perfect yet she let my brothers do whatever they wanted. When I got older and I was living under her roof, I helped with bills whenever she needed it, I always paid things on time, and I just tried to be as normal as possible. My brother was always behind, she paid some of his bills for him, and it never mattered to her. \nThe last straw I finally had with her, was when one day when I was already with my boyfriend for about 4 months, I wanted to go to Louisiana with him to visit his parents. I decided to quit my job at the daycare that I no longer wanted, and left to go be with him without telling her. I was 21 years old, why should I have to tell her? When I came back, she just started to attack me. Telling me about all of her problems, how much SHE had to deal with, and at the end of the day how much of a loser I was. She attacked me for about 30-40 minutes. I didn\u2019t say anything wrong to her. I just told her, \u201cYou know what? After EVERYTHING I\u2019ve been through with you there are so many things I can say about you. But I\u2019m not, because I\u2019m not you.\u201d She proceeded to tell me how I needed to leave to think about what I needed to do next. I cried, I moved in with my boyfriend, and I have never looked back. Right now as I look back on my life there\u2019s been so many times I\u2019ve contemplated suicide. So many times I wished I was someone else. So many times I\u2019ve felt like I wasn\u2019t enough....yet I\u2019m here and I want to be happy. I feel like I\u2019m not enough for my boyfriend, because I feel like I\u2019m not psychologically whole or right enough to be with such a good man. I\u2019m crying right now because I still love my mom to this day, and I love him so much. If someone could just...help me and give me words of encouragement that would be so nice. Sometimes I feel so alone and that no one feels or understands my pain. \n\nMy mom apologized a couple of months later, I asked her to admit that she wanted me to fail. She told me she didn\u2019t...I know she\u2019s lying. I keep my distance away from my mom and my family because at the end of the day I don\u2019t think they ever could know how much I suffered because of that woman. Sometimes I contemplate completely cutting them off once I move to another state. I know I\u2019m worthy of love and I know I\u2019m better. I\u2019ve been in a string of abusive relationships with men because of how the way she made me feel and how men had made me feel growing up. I never knew love without pain until now. I\u2019m truly thankful for my boyfriend, because he\u2019s the only stable person in my life who has shown me love without chaos or limits. I just wanted to share my story with SOMEONE. I feel so crazy and alone sometimes when I think about it all. If you read this, thank you so much. ", "subreddit": "survivorsofabuse"}

So I wasn't even to expect affection and love from him. There was no sex, no compliments, nothing. Just... nothing. I kept thinking we would get it back if I just played by the rules but of course we never did. In fact, even if I did everything right, nothing ever improved.

The first 2.5 were great --I guess we were in \"honeymoon\" state-- while the last half of a year has been quite bad.\n\nIt all started when she pushed me to get married six months ago. \n\nI rejected the idea. I thought the reason was only a commitment issue for me --which is also probably true-- but when I started to describe what doesn't \"feel right\" to me about our relationship and getting married, I noticed a few patterns on my GF: \n\n- She's hardly ever wrong in our discussions. And if she finally admits to be wrong in something, she says I hurt her during the argument, so I also must apologize. On our last argument I mentioned this pattern, so she didn't immediately told me I hurt her, she admitted her fault and I thought that was it. Three days later, she raised an issue with my past argument and it turns out I must apologize.\n\n- There's always a problem in her life. Always drama. And I always find myself trying to make her feel better, I'm her \"coach\", I use logic to make her see things are not so bad, she is not so bad, problems are normal. She feels better for a day or two.. then she comes back with the same drama or a new one.\n\n- She's always feeling bad about herself. Specially when she doesn't achieve what she wants in business. She achieves A LOT, I would argue, but since there are other things she doesn't, she believes of herself as a failure. I analyzed her personal history with her to show her the achievements and she feels better for a while, then gets down when something doesn't come her way.  Objectively speaking, she hasn't achieve her main goal (making her business profitable) but she's not that bad either, she's has been showing progress.\n\n- She's always a victim.. of herself, life or others. She goes back and forth between those. Things are always unfair.\n\n- This phrase is her perfect description: \"the life they live does not meet the fantasy of the life they feel entitled to\".

When I lived with my parents, she constantly tormented me. She would beat me, spread rumors about me to my parents, siblings, and anyone who would listen, among other things. I was so ashamed of being bullied and abused by my younger sister. Who would believe I was bullied by someone younger? Sure she was much, much bigger than me, but who would believe me?\n\nI spent most of my time protecting my little brother from her, breaking up fights she started with others and taking the blows, and being driven to the brink of suicide due to her many, many times instead of being able to study and concentrate on my studies. This was in addition to the sexual abuse, mental abuse, and physical abuse from my father and others within the family and classmates. My grades suffered and I grew reclusive. For me, there was never an ability to get those kinds of scholarships, to go those kinds of schools. My family never abused her as they did me because I was stupid and tried to play the hero. As bottom of the pecking order there, me stepping in and helping helped them, but those people disrespected me and bullied me in turn so as not to become like me. All I have is mental illness to show from it.\n\nEven now, I struggle. I have bad mental illness, no friends, awkward disposition, ugly features, better job but poor pay, poor social skills/life and real-world experience, shoddy/cluttered apartment, and lackluster/depressing love life, poor physical health. \n\nI am working on improving things: I am going to school to get a degree (been in school forever due to working, but just have year left), going out and working on social skills and meeting people, working on learning new skills (programming, gardening, cooking, knitting), starting exercising again (used to be much more healthy), fighting depression through working on these and cleaning more routinely, setting boundaries with family and lover, etc. I am not going to therapy though due to bad experiences. Things are getting better, but it makes me feel terrible that someone who bullied me to the brink of attempting suicide can succeed while I continue to flounder. It makes me wish I never existed; I already hate myself, but feel even worse. What's the point of continuing?\n\nI have blocked her number now.", "subreddit": "abuse"}

He was awful a lot, but me too and I constantly think about the things I said, he said and the arguments. I read a lot about narcissistic personality disorder, and to be honest sometimes I think I have NPD, the next day I think he has and I just search for the clues.\n\nA few months before our break up I got home, turned on the TV and started eating. I watched a tattoo show, when he got home. I even remember that they tattoed leopard pattern on a woman's face. I stepped to him, gave him a kiss and asked \"How was your day?\". During that I looked at him, than I looked at the TV and back at him.\n\nHe started yelling, because I \"Don't give attention to him\", \"I always shut him off\", etc., etc. I denied that and told him that I don't want to waste the whole afternoon arguing, so please stop. I told him that I was just curious how the woman's face looks like, so I just went into defensive.\n\nHe was furious and after about an hour of fighting (because after a while I became mad too) he said \"You are always watching screens, you just don't give a damn about me, when I got home I asked how your day was and you didn't even answered, because you were so involved with the f.ckin TV!\".\n\nI remember that my mind almost exploded and I just shouted \"THAT DID NOT HAPPEN!\". During arguments we usually got to the point when we had two different versions about what happened earlier, but that was the only time I knew for sure that I remember correctly. We argued about that too, but because of that realization I became so mad, that he backed off and he confessed \"Okay, it's not exactly how it happened, but I was really mad!\"\n\nWhy? Why would he lie about that? Is that an example of gaslighting?\n\nSorry for mistakes, english is not my native language.\n", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Im merely looking to confirm my suspicions, i'm not an expert on narcissism by any means - but if my suspicions are correct it would help me with the healing journey as it would explain a lot of the pain im going through.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfor the longest time I thought my ex has borderline personality disorder, i didn't suspect narcissism because my ignorant view of narcissism was that its over vanity and bravado. i initially thought borderline because of her sudden emotional outbursts and because thats what my therapist thought she was from just one story i told her. we broke up over 6 months ago, so i've been reading stories and comments on BPDLovedones for a while and while a lot of her behavior matched with the behavior described there - some key behaviors didn't match.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe wasn't clingy or needy - in fact she was extremely avoidant (narcissistic trait?)\n\nShe didn't overtext - in fact she always ghosted and left you on read and took her time responding if she ever did, when she quit her job and moved to another state she ghosted many of her coworkers, even the ones she was \"friendly\" with - to the point that now they ask me about her because she still hasn't answered them and its been weeks.\n\nShe wasn't overtly jealous - i'm not sure if she had jealousy issues internally, but she never appeared jealous at all. never questioned me (of course i was never deceiving her) and never made jealous scenes or wanted to read my conversations or anything like that. in fact she was open to a poly relationship, so she could stroke her ego without the stress of getting caught cheating. (narcissim?)\n\nshe very very very rarely (once) tried to use a suicide threat as a way to control me - but it was more of a way to stop the conversation, as oppose to prevent me from leaving. in fact, she always waited for you to make the first move, so if i stopped talking to her, she would wait days until initiating a conversation with me. that conversation was always a way to see if i was over the issue and if i wasn't, she'd go back to ghosting after telling me to \"move on from it\" (narcissism?)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nin terms of narcissistic traits, this is what tipped me off. she seemed to lack genuine remorse, she displayed remorse but i could never tell with her if she really meant it or she was just saying a pre-recorded message. she apologized about things, but was never specific about exactly what she was apologizing about. apologies would sound something like this \"i'm sorry i hurt you\" or \"im sorry i get so emotional\" but never any sign of \"i'll work on it\" or \"i'm going to try and do better\".\n\nshe never uttered the words \"i understand how you feel\" but she displayed insane amounts of cognitive empathy, meaning she could understand how her actions were affecting me and she could strategize around my feelings - but it never felt to me like she really actually cared herself about what i was feeling, just that she knew what i was. What i mean is, she understood how her actions would make me feel jealous but never apologized for doing those actions - instead she would always blame shift - \"i flirted because i felt denied by you\"\n\nfurthermore, she loved to be the center of attention. never got interested in my hobbies and i have a lot of hobbies. never interested in my work outside of asking \"how was work\", basically she never engaged in any deep conversations or showed any real genuine interest in any of my hobbies or feelings or thoughts for that matter - however, she was FILLED with random stories. Exquisite story teller. Especially at work, she was bubbly, spunky, charming, witty and quick to tell a story. If something happened to you, she had a story that would match or outdo yours. If you got pulled over, she also got pulled over and her story is more extreme than yours. If you got into a fight at school as a child, she got into more fights in school as a child...etc, stuff like that. felt very very ego centric.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nshe talked about wanting to marry a sugar daddy, but like everything else with her I could not tell if she were lying or just kidding or it was one of those jokes that have a little bit of truth in them, same with telling me that \"you almost do everything I tell you, but its okay we're still working on that\" - i took that as a cute joke (everyone knows happy wife, happy life bs) but now I'm thinking maybe there was some truth to it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nplease keep in mind that the relationship had all the classic stages of all cluster b relationships. Idealization, devaluation and eventual discard - when she started flirting with her coworker, while convincing me im just jealous and acting insecure (which i was of course groomed to believe), after the \"break up\" she rationalized her behavior by saying I never made our relationship official and she felt denied by me which is why she started flirting with someone else (asked why she would hide it from me she said \"i don't like change\")\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nlet me know what you think", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

I've experienced a lot of relationship trauma in the past that I've healed from so luckily this time I've been able to stay strong and not let it drag me down into a depression or a breakdown. Right now I've blocked the person in question, and this evening I temporarily unblocked her to send her the following. Immediately after it had sent I made sure to block her again so as to not be dragged into anything. I wanted to share what I sent in the hopes that it will be useful and encourage others who have experienced this type of abuse that they are not alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Typically I've always associated narcissism with the classic definition. Remember \\[x\\] I told you about from work? She was one of those. Fake, overly happy and flirty personality to make up for her own insecurities. She had the vanity, always posting selfies with vague quotes; she had the wealth; driving a custom plate beamer and expensive clothes; she had the grandiosity, believing she was the best and the only reason she couldn't find anyone to date was that no one was up to her standards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat I didn't realise is that there are more subtle and difficult to recognise versions of narcissism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe people who feign interest in your life and at first glance, appear to be genuine caring people. They very openly tell you about their life and like to virtue-signal, pretending that they truly care about the people in their life and about you. Soon you begin to notice that most of what they talk about revolves around them. Any interest in you or other people is usually used to return to focusing on them. They do things to force you to pay attention to them, silly things, subtle things. They talk incessantly at you, and dominate conversation, only half listening to the things you say and just waiting for a chance for them to talk. They know that too many outward demands would give them away, so often they resort to passive aggressive tactics like messaging or phoning someone else when they don't get the attention they think they deserve, or sulking and running off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey use love-bombing as a tactic to win you over. Showering you with intense compliments and you believe them thinking you've found someone who truly loves you and someone you can love. Gradually these fade away and are only brought out when they need to be, like at some point after an argument where they feel like they've won and they need to reel you back in to thinking they're benevolent and loving.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey have a very uncompromising view of reality, and see any opposing view or slight criticism as an attack or stupid and respond accordingly. If you call them out on their behaviour, they're not interested in correcting it or apologising directly and resolving the problem. Instead they will defend themselves, saying things like they were only joking or that it was all out of affection. They will minimise the issue and tell you you're too sensitive and that you're over reacting, it was never meant to hurt you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny attempt you make to help them understand a different point of view that's closer to reality is dismissed. They will cherry pick things you say that give them an opportunity to validate their view of reality, and will push the conversation in circles until you give up and admit defeat through exhaustion. They take note of any things you have told them in confidence, and use them against you when it's obvious that they're not winning the verbal exchange and they feel threatened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny apologies they do give you will be for different things than the original issue, and then they will pretend that they have already apologised a million times and that you just can't let go of things. Any issue will be blame-shifted back on to you, telling you that it was because you don't communicate enough or you're too quiet or you just have a low threshold for teasing. If only you'd have said something then they would have stopped. When you do say something, they create an argument out if it. Maybe they will take note of it and not do that particular thing again, but they will find another way to get what they need.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey participate in Reactive Abuse. They will deliberately do things to annoy you, to garner attention, and provoke you. They push and push until they get a reaction out of you. The moment you snap and show your annoyance or anger, they have the opportunity to be a victim and will seize it. Suddenly you're the one who's abusive, shouting and saying horrible things and they can act frightened or be a grey rock and smirk at you while you lose your shit. They will pick at all your faults, maybe you can be a little passive aggressive when you're annoyed, and they will make the whole thing about how you reacted to their abuse, claiming you're the insane one until you start to believe it and look into the possibility that you might have BPD.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou do everything you can think of to try and solve the problem because it seems like everything is your fault. You consider therapy and research information on what you can do to overcome it. You project your own abilities and good nature on to them and expect that they are doing the same. Eventually you realise that they are not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou come back to try again and it's almost as if nothing has changed with them. They overstep the boundaries you set to help get the relationship back on track and do the things you've asked them not to do and told them are problems. You sit in disbelief and wonder why the hell they would do that. You start doing more research into why someone would do any of these things and you find out about a different type of narcissism you never knew existed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou read about the signs and symptoms, the way these people act and what they think and believe. You research the causes and find out it's related to early childhood trauma and maladaptive parenting. You find out they have low emotional intelligence, and the way they deal with things is immature due to a part of their brain that didn't develop correctly. You read anecdotes and stories about what other people have experienced and you quickly begin to piece everything together. Everything you've brought up with them previously suddenly makes sense and you understand why they behave as they do. If you're lucky, you're already strong and can be happy regardless, learning from the whole experience and continuing your life without any major disruption. You're relieved you finally have answers.\"", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

When I get on a roll it's hard to stop! Haha\n\nI posted here a couple of times a few months back about the mistreatment I was getting from a girl who had come into my life while I was at an emotional weak point. I firstly just wanted to thank the good people of this sub for pointing out some of the red flags and confirming that there was a very good chance I had a covert narc on my hands. (I wasn't even familiar with the term before this girl arrived on the scene). And secondly I was hoping to pick your brains for some advice/reassurance on her latest attempt at messing with my head. I have been told by many people that the worst way to deal with a narc is to challenge them on their behavior as they immediately take the defensive and set out to sabotage you, so I'm just wondering how exactly I should go about firmly creating distance between myself and my narc after her latest hoover attempt.\n\nTo give you a little background, this girl was left by her former boyfriend of 10 years for another woman in January of last year, and I was going through a break up of my own at around the same time. She must have seen a certain vulnerability in me and latched on to me almost immediately after my previous relationship ended. Things were very intense in the beginning, during what I now know was the love bombing phase. She was saying all the right things to keep me on side. Telling me how I was \"one in a million\" and that she now realized that her ex \"never loved her and never treated her this well\". Eventually we slept together, and from about two days later there was a dramatic shift in her behavior and she was totally different. She called me at midnight bawling crying on the phone saying that she had just been verbally attacked by her ex over the phone for an hour. Turns out she had contacted him the night before we slept together to tell him that she was ready to move on with me and she was just letting him know out of \"decency\". Naturally, he didn't give a shit, having already settled down with his new lady (who it turns out had also left someone to be with him). She then proceeded to tell me that she had contacted the ex of the other girl (who she had never met) through a private facebook mail when she was drunk later that same night. She wouldn't elaborate on why she contacted him but I suspected it was for a revenge booty call. The bloke, not knowing her from Adam, was freaked out and told his ex about the contact...hence the angry phone call that reduced her to tears. Don't ask me why she felt the need to confess any of this to me but during his phonecall to her, her ex apparently told her that he feels sorry for me and almost obligated to warn me about the type of person I'm getting into a relationship with. A red flag for sure, but she had 100% reeled me in by this point so I was looking at EVERYTHING through rose tinted goggles. I reassured her, told her not to worry and that I wasn't going anywhere. She apologized for being such a mess on the phone and burdening me with that shit and promised it wouldn't happen again.\n\nThe following two months were a f@@king roller coaster to say the least. If you can believe it, we ended up in a situation where she would text me from sunrise to sunset every single day of the week, bar-none. But it is with a heavy heart that I tell you that despite this, I could NEVER get her to commit to another date from that point on. Any plans that were made (and then subsequently broken) were all made on her say-so. I had quickly learned not to put her on the spot and suggest anything specific as she would fly off the handle saying it was \"pressure\", so ultimately left it to her to make plans for dates etc. What would happen is she would feel me losing interest every couple of weeks and then dangle a proverbial carrot in the form of vague plans to \"maybe do something this weekend\" to reel me back in, and then she would of course find an excuse to break said plans on the day. I'm ashamed to admit, this worked on me...probably for a lot longer than it should have. The last straw came on the day of my birthday...By mid afternoon I hadn't heard a peep out of her. I had already been contacted by my nearest and dearest with well-wishes...including my ex. But nothing from her until late afternoon and only in response to a text I sent her asking how her day was going. She apologized for not getting in touch sooner, that things were crazy at work and joked that it was my fault for having my birthday at such an awkward time.\n\nAin't that some shit???\n\nSaw everything for what it was at that moment and suddenly any positive feelings I had for her evaporated and I just felt jaded. Immediately cut contact with her and booked myself a holiday. Believe it or not she tried to strike up conversation again only a couple of days later, acting like the unpleasant conversation on my birthday had never happened. I was just matter-of -fact in my replies and made sure not to keep the conversation going. Sometime around November she seemed to get the hint.\n\nChristmas and new year both pass without any contact from her. Then I went on a skiing holiday to France with a group of friends in early Jan. Posted some pictures on instagram and almost immediately upon seeing them she gets in touch, telling me how she was so jealous of my holiday and that it looked amazing but I really deserved it after the year I had (The irony was not lost on me). She then said \"Miss you. Let me know if you'd like to get a drink and catch up\". Once again, ashamed to say that I fell for it. At the time I was working every weekend and she worked Mon-Fri so we picked a Saturday and it looked like the date was actually gonna happen this time. I booked a day off work for it and told her that I had done so. She said \"great\" and then I didn't hear from her again until 8pm on the night of the proposed date. Call me crazy but I don't think you can give someone a more clear cut sign of your commitment to a date than by telling them you've booked a day off for it, so as a matter of principle I wasn't making the next move. So 8pm rolls around on the Sat night and a text comes in \"did you forget about tonight? haha\"... I couldn't believe my f@@king eyes. She had done it again... thrown some semblance of doubt over whether this was just a misunderstanding or something more sinister. I said \"of course not...I did book the day off for it after all. I just assumed when I didn't hear from you that you had lost interest.\" She said \"Oh my God...I thought the same\". (F\\*\\*k outta here with that bullshit). I said I didn't know whether to laugh or cry but that it was still early and we could still meet if she wanted. Then she started with the \"Oh well, I'm actually feeling a flu coming on too...I feel awful, you booked the day off for this\". I told her not to worry about it. It was around this time that I stumbled upon her on tinder as well...Which I found interesting.\n\nSo I went right back to keeping my distance and only replying politely whenever she would contact me. This past Thursday she contacted me again asking if I had any plans for this weekend. I told her I was free on Saturday (out of curiosity to see what she was up to more than anything else) She took a half an hour to reply (after being the one to instigate the conversation) and she threw out the most blatantly half-assed suggestion for a date I've ever heard in my life. She said she was \"half thinking\" of going for a couple of drinks in her town on Sat night if I fancied catching up. But made sure to point out that it would be just a couple of drinks as she had to be up early on the Sunday morning. I should also point out that she lives three towns (about 15 miles) away from me and that the public transport system is unbelievably shitty here. So since we'd have been drinking that meant I wouldn't have been able to drive so my only way to get there would have been a taxi - $30 each way. I should also point out that our towns are both an equal distance from the next big city with endless options for public transport, so we could have both made an equal effort and literally met in the middle...but no...this offer was exclusively for a drink in her hometown and nothing else. She even ended the message by saying \"don't know if that's too awkward for you\". So all I could see when I read the message was \"Listen, I could use a drink and you're clearly a pushover...so I want to be clear that I'm making fuck-all effort in this scenario...This either happens on my doorstep or it doesn't happen at all\". I politely replied with \"I see...Yeah to be honest it's not ideal for me. I'm looking at a $30 taxi journey each way...bit pricey for a couple of drinks\"\n\nShe replied with \"no worries\" and I haven't heard from her since. No suggestion to meet in a neutral place, or no plans to reschedule when she didn't have to be up early the next morning. Just a simple \"no worries\". Almost like the whole thing had been some sort of big shit-test. But history has shown that just when I think I've heard the last of her, she resurfaces as a new and improved covert narc. What do you guys think? Is it just a matter of time before I hear from her again? And how do I tackle the situation if I do?\n\nThanks again for the advice, and just generally being awesome!!!", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Namely, when they are beginning to wake up to the narc's games but are still at risk of being duped. \nMy friend is very very agreeable. He goes above and beyond for you. He is a \"acts of service\" type of person. If you ask him to pick you up when you are really far away he will go and pick you up. Me and another friend I will refer to as Drew have commented on how worrisome it is, because he risks being taken advantage of. \nSo if you have read my previous posts on narcissism, you will be aware I have dealt with narc \"friends\" before. So my agreeable friend (let's call him F) collected 60 cases for this narc's study (actuall it was his gf's as she did all the conceptualization and write up). My friend F has been on multiple presentations for that study, with no issues. F was also in charge of recruiting those participants from  classes and scheduling those data collection sessions.\nComes the time I discard the narcissist and make my own lab, and F joins with me and helps me out. So the narc submits a presentation to a new conference, but does not include my friend F despite all the work he did. F says he insisted he wanted to be on that presentation and that he was willing to do more work if necessary, but that the narc said he shouldn't double dip too much and that he was already presenting with me and didn't want to burden him too much. Obviously this is bullshit. As stated before, F has been in the study presentations multiple times. This newer presentation where F was excluded from includes the same authors as the previous times, except for F. The narc also said the analyses are different. But that is obviously bs because again, same authors as before. Why not F? My guess is that the narc is being passive aggressice with F because F is also helping me out. \nWhen I found out F wasn't part of the presentation I was mad and told F about it and showed his name wasn't in the program. His response exasperated me: he says he doesn't want to fight that battle. That he insisted, but that it doesn't matter. \nFor fucks sake he collected 60 cases, and scheduled those sessions and recruited, not to mention he trained some people too. F was one of the people who did most of the work. \nF has said he wants to leave the narc's lab, but that he wants to stay a little longer and ease out. \nI feel like he is clinging to hope that the narc is a good guy. Me and Drew have described F as without malice. We feel like he overstretches himself too much for others, sometimes to his or even others' detriment. \n\nWhat should I do? I have warned him a gazillion times but he will obviously do what he wants. I also feel sad whenever I see him because I know he is being exploited. He has been getting sick a lot probably because of lowered immune system defenses due to stress. His favorite phrase is \"don't worry. I will see how I can handle it myself\" whenever I ask him if he is sure he wants to do something. ", "subreddit": "NarcissisticAbuse"}

Last night I came close to self-harming, which I hadn't done in over 10 years. I had some good friends of mine call and talk me out of it. I'm grateful they did. \n\nI've been struggling with depression for most of my life and I'm coming to find that certain people and situations tend to exacerbate things. I've been talking to this guy for over two years and he keeps making excuses not to see me. Everything was perfect in the beginning, the connection was there, and he made me feel validated, understood, and cared for. Then he began to devalue and eventually, discarded me, hoovering every now and then. I didn't know what all of this was until I found out about narcissistic abuse. Despite knowing about narcissistic abuse, I continue to chase him anyway. I block him, don't speak to him, and then I initiate contact again. I want things to change every time, but they never will. He was supposed to see me today. He promised me. I texted him to hangout and see if he was going to see me, but he went ahead and made this excuse that he was out with his family and that \"family comes first.\" I lost it. I told him about how I almost landed up in the hospital last night, almost self-harmed, how I couldn't stop crying at work, and how I was sick and tired of him playing this head game again on me. Why have I been so stupid to deal with this? I feel stupid going back to him every time. Last night I felt so low, like I wanted to die and no longer exist. He was so nice to me in the beginning. He was sweet to me, always giving me compliments and wanting to see me. Now it's like I have to beg to see him. It's like he bails on me and makes excuses just to hurt me. I'm in so much pain and I am so heartbroken. I can't deal with this depression anymore. No, him and I were never in a relationship. But when you talked to someone everyday for several months telling them that they would be there for you all the time and that they cared, to no not giving a fuck at all is a stretch. Yet he comes up with the old \"you're not my gf, you're not my wife, I can fuck whoever I want,\" etc. By the way, I never said he couldn't see other people because I knew we weren't in a relationship. But I just asked for attention and for him to be kind to me. He could have taken me out on a date or invited me over to his house, which he did with other girls but not me. It's like he's ashamed or embarrassed of me because I'm average looking with a shitty career. All I wanted was to have this person in my life. I blocked him but I feel like I'll go back to him for the millionth time. I just wanted to feel loved and cared for. I feel so gross, worthless, and disgusting. I've been going to therapy, but everytime I go it doesn't really help me all that much. I've seen a slew of therapists, so please don't suggest therapy to me. It really doesn't work for me AT ALL. I think I'll cave in and take an SSRI so I can function better. I'm just afraid of gaining weight. I'm going to hold back tears now for the rest of the day, cry myself to sleep, and continue to feel sad for the next week. Don't know how to deal with this anymore.
